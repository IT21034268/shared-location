1,Junk,"It broke in 5 months. Skips, and then stops and starts. It was never dropped, in fact, it was seldom moved. It just wore out. Used about 5 hours a week for 5 months, so after about 100 hours it failed.As some have mentioned it is loud, but that never bothered me. I think a product should have more than 100 hours of life though."
3,Philips PET824 good and bad,"Nice player in some ways (long battery life and good picture quality), but it doesn't handle any of my DVD's which are copies. It only seems to be able to play store-bought DVD's. Also, it doesn't seem to be able to do forward or reverse scans without the remote control. Overall, I'm not very happy with it."
5,Great Portable DVD Player,"The battery-life on this player is phenomenal! I've watched 4 full movies on one battery charge. I am very pleased with this purchase. The player is sturdy and compact. The picture is great and the sound quality (without the headphones) is average. With the headphones, the sound is also fantastic. The battery IS a little large, but it's not like I'm going jogging with it. And yes, there is a loudish whirring as the DVD starts to play, but it is the equivelent to the sound of any notebook computer starting up. And the whirring resolves once the movie gets going. All in all, this is a fantastic purchase, great quality for the price."
3,lots of good features; what does mpeg4 really mean?,"A lot of good features but rather heavy. Advertised to play ""MPEG4"" which is similar to MP4 format used in Video Ipod devices or Zune (assuming file of course, is not copy protected.) No one seems to have commented WHETHER a non-copy protected mp4 video on a DVD (not DVD formatted) which would play directly on a video ipod will play on PET824."
1,Noisey,"This thing sounds like an airplane taking off as the disk spins. Also, the speakers are mounted along the front, not up by the screen as other (better designed) players have. Even though it's a hassle, I'm sending this back."
4,Great buy!,"You can use this without the battery! and has a car charger too.I love this thing, the picture is good and big 8.5"" with different screen size settings.Simple is always good.4 stars because the battery is like quasimotos hump,its big(havent had time to comment on battery life).The sound is left to be desired,is that why they have 2 earphone jacks? hmm.I bought this 4 days ago and now its 20 bucks less :( a great buy.well now it is!"
1,I Don't Recommend Buying This Item,"I read the customer reviews before buying this product, and decided to give it a try regardless of the multiple mentions of it being noisy. It doesn't matter how long the battery life (and it is long), or how nice the screen, it is so very loud when operating that I would never use it in public. It whirs, it spins, it squeeks, and then it does it all over again. Yikes! And, as other customers mentioned, it does have a high pitched squeek that doesn't go away when playing burned DVD's. I returned the product and tried another of the same, thinking it was possibly defective. The second shipment was just as bad as the first. This is truly a piece of junk!!!"
3,"Philips 8.5"" Portable DVD Player","Item came quickly. Packaged well and has all components. Does have a lot of scratches on the cover but the inside looks great. The picture is great but as other people have reviewed on amazon about this item, it is loud when you turn it on and while the dvd gets ready to play and while it's turning off."
2,"Looks good, plays badly!","I read the other reviews about the mechanical noises this DVD player makes while scanning the DVDs. I thought it was much to do about nothing, so I bought one anyway because of the long battery life and sleek look...but then I tried to play my first DVD! The other reviewers were not exaggerating! This thing could wake up a sleeping spouse with the mechanical noises it makes while it's thinking about whether it wants to play your disc or not! Eventually it started playing my DVD after 3o seconds or so. To be fair, it then played fine if you don't need to use the navigation buttons much. But if you need to go back to the main menu, etc, it is slow to respond to the buttons. I got really frustrated, and I am returining mine tomorrow!"
3,Eh,"I can say with all honesty that this is the best Cassie Edwards Savage book I have read so far. In the ones I read before, the white girl is always kidnapped and practically-raped by whatever Indian man kidnaps her (it's always a chief or the son of the chief of the tribe!)The Indian who kidnaps Ashley does so under a misunderstanding. However, misunderstanding is cleared up, and he does not force her to stay with her, and she is willing to make love with him. He never has to force her into anything and she willingly goes with him. This was new to me, so I upped the star rating.However, as always. Ms. Edwards abuses ellipses, and some of her dialogue is pretty terrible, especially when putting ellipses in bad dialogue, so I cannot give this book any higher than a 3. Still, it's a decent book, and one of the better Savage books I've read."
5,The big E at his Gospel Best,This is what a real masterpiece sounds like. The vocals are pure heart felt Southern Gospel at its best! the back up singers and musicians must be some of the finest around! this is a must for ant Elvis fan
5,The Perfect Spiritual Blend,"If you are looking for the best Gospel CD, look no for further! Elvis sings with depth and feeling. In addition, some songs are really spiritual while others are more lighthearted--giving a perfect blend of spirituality. This Ultimate Gospel CD is a must for every Christian."
5,Elvis: Ultimate Gospel,How can you go wrong with anything Elvis sings? I loved this CD and highly recommend it to anyone who likes Elvis gospel music.
4,Elvis praising The Lord in song is wonderful to the Holy Spirit!,"Gospel Praise so personal that the Holy Spirut who resides inside my heart radiates love and warmth, peace and Glory."
3,ELVIS ULTIMATE GOSPEL,"I love Elvis's voice but the songs in this CD have a lot of back-up singing, more like chorus. I missed his rich SOLO voice! I bought this CD because of others' rave reviews! One sure way is to take the time to listen to the sample songs!"
1,Elvis' middle name,"PLEASE!!! Amazon, please tell your biographers that Elvis' middle name is Aron, not Aaron! His mother spelled it with one A."
1,amazon product review,"i did not receive the product from the supplier and am supposed to be getting a refund via my credit card acct.i ended up buying the cd at best buy in henderson, nevada."
5,Elvis gospel,No one can sing more beautiful gospel music than Elvis Presley and this CD is a perfect example of that. It brings tears to your eyes. He puts a whole lot of feeling into all the songs. The songs are my all time favorite gospel songs.
5,My boyfriend loved it,"I got this for my boyfriend who is a die-hard fan, and he loves it. Highly recommended for true Elvis fans."
5,"Light, Crispy and Perfect Size","These are very good and priced right. Let's face it, rice cakes will never taste like a crispy potato chip or cheese doodles. However, these cakes don't taste like cardboard and actually have a nice flavor. Also, they do help to tame hunger pains which makes staying on a healthy eating program easier. I especially like their crispiness. Well worth the money and a wonderful take-along snack."
4,Dot-Com to Dot-Bust,This is a well documented and well written book on what went wrong with the Dot=com boom and bust. It's still relavent today with the new Tech related issues of today.
5,Perfect solution.,"An unfortunate mishap left my OEM passenger side mirror hanging and broken beyond repair. Checked the local Ford dealer where they wanted $196 for a new one. I had my doubts about ordering from the internet, from a place I knew nothing about. Some reviews left me wavering, but I decided to try anyway. My new mirror fits perfectly, operates like new, does not shake like some reviews state. I could not be happier or more satisfied. I would do it again."
1,not what i thought,"i have been looking for a clock with a dual alarm. the buttons were too small to find in the morning, and , for me, the displa was way too bright. it has a dimmer, but it did not do too much dim the numbers. i returned the item."
1,Useless clock,"From day one the clock went ahead about 3 hours everyday. Even if you correct the time every night before sleeping, by the time it wakes you up in the morning it is close to one hour earlier than the actual time you wanted to get up. Used only for two days only. Unfortunately, I had discarded all the packaging when I received the clock and cannot return it."
1,Embroidery is but not the blanket,Fleece is not of good quality. It looks like it has been washed 15 times in hot water!!
2,Disappointing.,"After so many great books and after such a long time between books, this one was a big letdown. Save your money."
1,I can't believe you would do that Mr Lehane!,"Disappointment quickly followed excited anticipation after reading the first story. Hoping it would get better I kept going just to become more and more exasperated and frustrated. I realized that I was actually angry at having been taken for a fool. In my opinion, Mr.Lehane used his fame to bring back some of his previous work which sounds like lines written with no purpose other than to lose the reader or even worse: a small attempt "" a la Steinbeck"" in Out of Dogs which came too close to ""Of mice and men""which WAS a great story."
2,Dark Dark Dark,"While I love Dennis Lehane, his prose his timing and generally his stories; these stories get more and more depressing as you move along."
2,Stutter Island,"Having consumed the Kenzie and Genaro series followed in quick succession by the rest of his works I left on a high with Shutter Island awaiting his next release.This is a case of really not worth the wait. If you're new to LeHane's work then invest in his back catalog skip this book in it's entirety. If this is your first DL book then don't measure him on this.The book starts well, the first short story is not a bad read. I really felt that it went down hill from there. Sorely disappointed."
1,Not Up To The Lehane Standard,"A collection of short stories and a script, this was very disappointing. Dennis Lehane is among my favorite authors, but these stories fell far short of his usual great reads. It seems like these were old stories that were lying around and there was a thought that if they were bundled together in an attractive package, a quick buck could be made. Ugh!"
2,Terribly depressing,"First, let me say that I think Lehane is a fabulous writer having read Mystic River, A given day, Shutter Island, Sacred and the other Kenzie and Gennaro thrillers. However, I started reading Coronado twice and suffered through half of two stories wondering why I would want to read about these terribly ruthless, thoughtless, brainless misfits, who are killing and destructing without a second thought. I did not even feel pity for them, just utter disgust. Oh, it is certainly well written I just don't want to read about these people, there is enough of that in the press unfortunately."
4,"If you're a Dennis Lehane fan, be sure you don't pass up CORONADO","If you're a Dennis Lehane fan, be sure you don't pass up CORONADO, his book of short stories and one play. These stories are not new; they have all appeared in various publications before. But you probably haven't read them.For me, these short stories were my fix to tide me over until Lehane's next full-length novel. I enjoyed them, but they weren't enough to satisfy me."
3,Scattered,"A number of pages are taken up with a two-act play here which I didn't read, but of the stories I read I enjoyed them particularly RUNNING OUT OF DOG which is haunting. If you are accustomed to his longer novels including his great more recent THE GIVEN DAY, you probably won't like these snippets some of which can feel incomplete. If you're a completist there are interesting characters to be found even if you only meet them for a short time."
1,A major disappointment,"I had read every one of Dennis Lehane's books and was so excited to see that he had a new one coming out. I preordered it and couldn't wait to dive into it. Well, I was bitterly disappointed! This book seemed to be written by someone else entirely. It was depressing and lackluster, as if he had been forced at gunpoint to write something. His other books are brilliant; I'm hoping he will write another one with Patrick and Angela. Wonderful characters and great plotlines."
1,I'm Glad I Read This One Last,"I have been a big fan of Dennis Lehane over the years and have read all of his Patrick Kenzie novels and was hungry for more of his writing. I saw two books by him on Amazon that were not part of the Kenzie series and bought them just because Lehane was the author. The first book was ""Shutter Island"" and I loved it. The other book was ""Coronado"" and I thought it was horrible. Even though Dennis Lehane's name is on the cover, I have trouble believing that the same man who wrote all those other great books wrote this trash. If Coronado had been the first Lehane book I read, it would also have been the last and I would never have known his true talent."
3,Not For Beginners,The book is terrific once you learn how to use it. Took a while for me--but I appreciate the different sizes and the styles that are interchangeable. The introduction could do a better job of explaining how to make the patterns work.
3,Not for the novice,"This book offers quite a variety of patterns for many sizes of dolls. It is not for the novice sewer as the adjustments for certain patterns require previous knowledge and more advanced sewing skills. Patterns must be copied or traced before use, as the larger sizes are on multiple pages. However, sizes range from 7"" dolls to larger 18""+ dolls."
3,Not the best for even intermediate skills,"It's a beautiful, well produced book, with nice pictures. BUT,the patterns, especially the patterns for the larger dolls, are practically incomprehensible and I've been sewing for years. The explanation on how to use these patterns is insufficient. If I had actually seen the book before buying, it would still be sitting on the shelf. I don't know if I'll even use the patterns and I will probably end up re-selling the book. The photos of the dressed dolls were great and provide good indeas, but trying to decipher the patterns probably isn't worth the trouble. Very disappointing."
4,Great addition to a doll makers book shelf,This is an awesome book for the doll artist. A wonderful grouping of costumes that most anyone will be able to use. Now all your little creations can have a pretty costume. Well worth the money.
3,Lacked suspense.,This was a pleasant-enough gothic. I enjoyed the relationships but would have liked a stronger element of suspense.
2,"Whoa, now","Uh, folks, this just isn't all that funny. In fact, it's downright sophomoric. I'm not opposed from some religious standpoint. The literary sin is that the writer just tries way too hard and ends up being silly. There's no flow, no spontaneity. It's an amateurish version of a Mel Brooks skit, nothing more. See ""Oh God"" the movie for a better story, for better humor. To rank this with Thurber, Wodehouse, Twain, et al. as a great work of humor is inane. Don't waste time with this little piece of nonsense."
5,One of the best books I have read,I read this book about 10 years back. It has remained in my memory for a long time now. It was double treat with God: The ultimate Autobiography occupying half the space and Hiss and tell memoirs the rest. Its sheer poetry in satire-writing. One of the best I have read. Ranks alongside best comic books of yore. Wish it comes back to life(print).
2,"Great Music, Ghastly Audio","Just click on the sample audio for ""The Hour Of Parting"" for a demonstration of how to turn a warm, rich, beautifully-recorded Columbia Viva-Tonal disc into a tinny-sounding piece of crap loaded with digital artifacts. Bill Hebden strikes again! And as usual some fine sides are desecrated here."
4,Still relevant,"The first parts are still relevant on the key features of lean manufactoring, supply chain management and product devolopment. The references has however become outdated."
3,"Don't ""Machine"" - try ""Lean"" instead","If you are just starting out learning about Lean Manufacturing, and you only have time to read one book, ""The Machine that Changed the World"" is an historically important book but ""Lean Thinking"" is the one that actually gets you started toward implementation. It's one of those rare occasions where the sequel was better than the original."
3,"This is not a ""how to book"", but rather, a ""history of"" book","Remember, this was published in 1990, and today is out of date. If you have come looking for specific examples, or secrets of how the Japanese have been making such huge gains, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU. The book is great from a historical standpoint, but it misses totally on any detailed examples of what Toyota has done. Anyone in manufacturing who has not heard of work-circles or suggestion boxes, would probably find this a great read with lots of info, but for the rest of us, this is just a history book. Go for Lean Thinking instead."
3,"Value, Balanced by Hype","There is some value in the book. The Toyota Production System gets description and a bit of explanation. I especially liked learning about how the TPS evolved. That the TPS is part of Toyota's culture is not much of a point; of course it is! Nevertheless, the aspect of culture is important and given space in the book.The authors take too much time and space hyping the story. They have created a false dichotomy to make thing more interesting, and I dare say, sell more books. The lean vs. mass production dynamic really is more a creation of the authors than something that exists in reality. Making that false dichotomy is not useful to learning or assaying potential improvements in management and production.Still, the book did open discussion in America more to the TPS. And, if even for the historical value, it's worth a read."
5,A must read for every student in business and engineering,This book is about a major study that has been executed in the beginning of the eighties about the competiveness of car manufacturing plants. Now we know that the Japense manufacturing is not that supriour after all this book is still a great book to read. For two reasons. First because its give a clear idea about how you can run a succesfull manufacturing plant and secondly because its give you a beautifull insight about a time when both Europe and the USA were affraid to loss it all to the Japanse. A classic on both business and industrial engineering
4,Well documented overview of how Lean changed the car industry,"""An excellent book which goes very deeply into the history of the car industry. The authors also clearly support through comprehensive research on comparison between traditional mass production systems approach and lean production systems approaches on the global car industry. This book is still quite relevant even in today's car market, or any industry for that matter when one considers moving to a lean environment. Mass production approach and theory is becoming less and less relevant and sustainable in a 21st century business, this book could already see this as the 21st century was approaching, this book was written in 1990.This book does require deep study, and can be challenging at times if you are someone who needs extra time with reading and understanding statistical information. In my opinion it is well work the extra time and effort."""
5,Congress should have read this book,"Wow. These guys in 1990 predicted the bailout of GM and Chrysler of 2009 and said that Ford was not going to be a victim. It is kept my interest during the entire read and did not feel I was reading a dated book. Anyone one that has an interest in autos, manufacturing or retention of jobs in the US should read this."
5,The machine that changed the world,"For interesting and thought provoking book. The big three, as well as American in general, is reaping that which we failed to grasp 30 years ago - the need for lean and a different approach to manufacturing overall. This book is very concise and informative with adequate data to back up its conclusions."
3,"Revolutionary, but boring","This book, though a revolutionary look at manufacturing (especially when it first came out) and specifically automotive manufacturing, is full of useful information, but dry as a cracker and boring to read if you're not an avid automotive industry enthusiast. If you are one like me, you'll enjoy it."
4,A good book for any production manager.,"The book was written in 1990 and most of the research was done in the mid-80s. The author is full of ideas on how lean production will save and revolutionize the world auto industry, but I'm interested to find out what's happened since then. One thing I find most interesting is that the author is particularly charmed by Toyota's use of many platforms and their economic feasibility due to their lean production techniques. This was true in the late 80s and early 90s, but was completely done away with until their recent SUV explosion, for the very reason that it was cost ineffective and nobody was buying their unnecessarily diverse models. At any rate, a good book, especially for one who has never heard of lean production before (such as I). I would really enjoy another book that gets more technically specific."
4,Readable for the layman,"Great book. I am no expert in manufacturing techniques, but I found the book readable, almost like a novel. Gives a good insight into the car industry up to 1990, and I would love to see a second edition of this, given all the changes in the 90's.The only downside I could find is that the book gets a little repetitive at the end."
4,Good Beginners Book,"This is a great book if you are just taking an interest in the auto industry and would like to gain a simple understanding of lean vs. mass production. Outside of the fact that the author hangs on a few subjects, this book reads very fast."
2,Over rated.,The Machine That Changed the World and the subsequent articles that Mr. Womack has written for the Wall Street Journal almost make him look like a shill for Toyota. This book either omits or minimizes the importance of developments that lead Toyota to the Toyota Production System. I expected a more independent and intellectually honest viewpoint because Mr. Womack passes himself off as a top academic.
2,Misleading and dated,"This is a fairly poorly researched book, despite the authors' credentials; their history of American automobiles is grossly inaccurate and only serves to reinforce incorrect stereotypes. They spend very little time actually describing lean production, preferring to talk about how every other company will go bankrupt because they don't have it. The misreading of the Volvo story is also rather galling, though to be fair, Volvo's team-based approach was already being dismantled (for non-by the time this book was written. This book is a product of the late 1980s, and should be regarded as a period piece rather than a serious academic work, though to be fair there are many lessons for manufacturers in it."
4,Simply Wonderful!,"""Hermetic Masonry"" is simply one of the best Hermetic and Qabalistic analyses of Freemasonry that I've ever read! In style and in substance, this work reminded me of Paul Foster Case's much better-known ""The True and Invisible Rosicrucian Order.""In my opinion, the best chapters in this book are those dealing with the Pythagorian (or '3, 4, 5') triangle and the Masonic letter 'G,' as well as an extended monograph which explores the significance of the triglyph A.'.U.'.M.'.I'd never read anything by Higgins before, but I'll certainly look for more of his titles in the future. I'd enthusiastically recommend this title to my Brothers in the craft, or to anyone with an interest in Freemasonry, esoterica, sacred geometry, or Qabala."
3,'Beyond The Valley Of The Dolls' Movie Soundtrack (Harkit) 3 1/2 stars,"Recent reissue, of the original twelve track lp that's been expanded to twenty-five cuts. Maybe a bit over done, but still worth owning a copy of. Decent job on the soundtrack of the over-the-top Russ Meyer's 1970 chick flick. Tunes I liked best were Carrie Nation's ""Look On Up At The Bottom"", ""In The Long Run"", ""Find It"" and especially the uptempo ""Sweet Talkin' Candy Man"" along with Strawberry Alarm Clock's ""Girl From The City"". Check this disc out for yourself when you can. A should-have."
3,harkit version is cool,"both this one, as the Harkit version has 25 tracks, and the Harkit version has a nice booklet. don't know a thing about this obscure label... so this bargain could be a bad sale...."
3,Far From Great,"Unfortunately, this is a book that is rather ""overhyped"" and after reading it in one day seldom find myself picking it back up again. In my opinion it lacks both spaniel training finesse and the knowledge presented by more prominent and experienced spaniel authors."
2,Salesman or Dog Trainer?,"I wouldn't reccommend it. As with many authors of dog books, this one reminds me more of a salesman than a knowledable dog trainer."
5,Urban Gun Dogs,"Excellent quality, excellent pictures and a fantastic layout. Everything you want to know from buying a puppy to house training, to a complete gun dog. All with innovative ideas for training in urban dwellings. A 'must have' for anyone interested in owning a gun dog."
4,A great addition to your bookshelf!,"Urban Gun Dogs is an excellent book for the city-dwelling novice gun dog owner who wishes to train their spaniel or retriever for upland game and non-slip retrieving. The basics are well covered, with tips on finding places to train, as well as an extensive section on handling your gun dog in hunt tests and field trials.Pam Kadlec, ""Retriever Training for Spaniels""Just Ducky Kennel & Spaniel Training Academy"
3,Play back!,"I just bought this DVD. Only the 2 Neapolitan songs are ""real"". The 2 opera excerpts are play back. To see him ""live"" in concert, get the Tokyo recital and also get the ""Great stars of opera"", in which he sings the love duet from Un Ballo In Maschera with Régine Crespin and E Lucevan Le Stelle from Tosca. His 2 Toscas and I Pagliacci are also play back. So is his Andrea Chénier. As far as I know only the La Forza Del Destino from Naples (with Renata Tebaldi and Ettore Bastianini) is live, however, the picture is rather blurry."
2,More interesting as history than as great music,"This is an old recording from the Voice of Firestone TV program of the late 1950s and early 1960s. TV audio of that period was poor by today's standards and, although the singers (especially Corelli) sing well, the poor recording quality of that period is shown in this DVD, which is in mono even though the DVD says it is in Dolby 2.0.It is interesting to see the much greater variety of commercial TV programing we had back then.The Voice of Firestone was one of a number of weekly classical music featured on comercial TV."
4,The battle plan,"I find this story, A Common Good to be a very revealing look at the interactions between these men and the dedication they have to their task of getting JFK into the Senate and then on to the white house.Both men, Robert Kennedy and Kenneth ODonnell share a devotion to their work and operate and cooperate in a like way.I think the book is a good source of how things are in a political campaign."
5,good book!,"This is a classic book. I have learned a lot from it. It really would make a teen understand how much you'd suffer if you had an eating disorder. In a very understanding way, the author explains what the side effects of having an eating disorder are and what the possibilities of having an eating disorder could be along with more intresting facts.The best thing in the book is that the author,Carolyn, gives you advice on how to stop and how to help a friend with an eating disorder. I say that this is a very helpful book...."
5,awesome,The service was great! I love the Tv show hell's kitchen so I wanted to have something at home to watch with Gordon Ramsay!!he's Awesome. I will be getting the other Season's as well!!!
5,Hell's Kitchen - Outstanding!,"Just as good as watching it on TV, in fact I would say its better. With the DVD's you're able to see and hear what you missed when it played on TV. The only thing I can say bad about this series is it takes so long to get the next season out. Chief Gordon rules the kitchen!"
1,worst overgrip I ever tried,Before I used Head and Prince overgrip. I decided to try dunlop since I use their racket. three matches and overgrip went to a garbage. Zero durability. It wears out leaving lot of grainy residue all over your hands.
5,Explore the historical roots of pastoral mentoring,"While there are some great contemporary books on mentoring in a ministry context, I really appreciated Brian's approach at the topic through the lens of Church history. Instead of just being another mentoring ""how to"" book (which come out all the time), the value of the book is in its exploration of how the historical Church has mentored it's pastors for 2000 years. This is a great read to complement some of the other mentoring books that are currently out."
5,Basha is a great read,"Basha is a very well written, fast paced thriller, that you will not put down. Knowledgeably written, with a sense of characters, politics and an intriguing area of the world."
5,Easy to follow and good for you,This video is gentle on my joints. I get to exercise without hurting myself. I also have had back pain off and on for years. This is helping my pain. I was told by my doctor to exercise but I don't like to sweat. I recommend this video for anyone who hasn't exercised in a long time. Its easy to follow.
5,Gentle Tai Chi,"Excellent Tai Chi tape for those just learning Tai Chi, or for those who want to increase their flexibility in an enjoyable and meditative way."
2,Hard to Follow,I found this video hard to follow. I was looking for something easier. Instruction is confusing.
5,Good NCLEX review material,"Love the format study piece before questions. Some questions in book were repeated on CD but that was maybe like 5 out of 100.Was the main bk that psych prof took his questions from for our test.Others considered good are Kaplan (as how to study aid with extra test), Lippincott, and Mosby."
4,Good Review Book but get another book for NCLEX questions,"I just passed the NCLEX!!!!! :-)Anyways, This book is a great review BUT the NCLEX questions in this book were much easier than the actual questions I saw on the test. Check out NCLEX 101: How to Pass! and Kaplan's NCLEX-RN Strategies for the RN licensing exam 2007 Edition for questions more like NCLEX.Good luck everyone!!!!"
5,Excellent NCLEX Review!,"This is by far one of, if not the most detailed compilation of nursing review I have seen yet. The book itself is huge! I enjoyed the layout of the information. I'm actually in nusring school now, but still look to this book to provide parallel study facts as I progress through the program. All in all a great book."
5,Great Review - Just Passed Boards Using Saunders,"Saunder's Comprehensive Review book provides a great overview for studying. Using the Review book along with the Q&A book (which has loads of questions), I was able to pass the boards. It took a lot of discipline to work through the book systematically, but it worked! Was definitely a good purchase - would highly recommend the Saunders system for board preparation."
5,I passed my NCLEX !,The book is great. I used it for just one week before my NCLEX and passed taking only 75 questions.
5,best nclex book,"This is by far the best prep book ive used. if you are in your 2nd to the last term or your last term of nursing school, use this book to prep for your exams and watch your scores go up."
1,Lost in the Mail,"They told me to wait for another week to get this book, ended up waiting for 5 weeks,only to receive an email that says it's considered lost in the mail. So disappointed."
5,book,Great book for nursing students. Arrived in condition described and a timely manner. Thank you!
5,If you want to pass the NCLEX-RN this is the book to review with,"I can't express how helpful this book was for me. It helped me pass the NCLEX-RN with flying colors. If you want to pass, this is the book you want. This book really made it easy for me to review and prepare for the actual test. Highly recommended."
5,essential,"This book is a fantastic resource. I use the text for reference but primarily study by using the companion CD. There are 4,000+ NCLEX style questions, and you can create your own 100 question practice exams based on subject area(oncology, endocrine, pediatric, pharmacology, nursing process, etc.), type of question (analysis, comprehension, application), and other details. There are many ways to personalize your tests to suit whatever you need to focus on. It also has many new format questions with check all that apply and diagrams, and keeps track of your previous exams so you can go back and review the rationales later on if you need to. I feel very prepared to take the NCLEX next week after completing 2,000 of these questions - working on the other 2,000 between now and then."
5,the best!,I studied only this book from cover to cover and it was more than enough to help me to pass both the CGFNS and the NCLEX-RN. I recomend this book to anyone that is willing to take time reviewing the theory and taking the exercises. It was a long path but now I look back and understand that everything was worthy!
2,It just broke....,"So, My interface just broke, not to be repaired and only a year and a half old. In order to use my iPod in the car, I have to buy a new interface. At least BestBuy where I bought the original interface will install a new one for free.....but they don't carry the interface anymore, I have to find my own. This unit is slow, sometimes my iPod doesn't turn off when I turn off the car. If I pause the head before I turn off the car, I am OK. Trying to find a song is painful...but until something better comes along..."
3,As advertised,Good photography for a time in Jellystone that is beautiful but often marred by the air and sound pollution of an army of snowmobiles.
4,"HEY, WHAT'S THAT ON THE COVER?","I can't actually describe my reasons for liking If -- they are sorta kinda like a number of other brass-inflected rock/fusion outfits of the period, and yet still not at all similar. Unusual vocals, less rhythmic predicability, tight ensemble work in favor of featured solos. I guess that's enough. Or perhaps by now it is simply a form of aural nostalgia, but the music has a bounce and tone that strikes me as still rare enough, especially the instrumental tracks here and throughout their too-small a catalog. Perfect music for light household chores or better still an outdoor gathering of a mid-summer evening."
5,This is a wonderful anime and volume!,"I've seen the ChiAnime release of this video and it's a must for any Fushigi Yugi fan! It has a wonderful recap episode, and it has many touching scenes and humorous scenes."
1,Slower than molasses,"I have been a user of Norton products for over eight years (and have installed the latest version each new year), so you can imagine my disappointment when I installed Norton Internet Security 2005, the latest version, and it slowed my computer to a point of extreme frustration. This new version clearly has so many new ""features"" that it has transcended from being ""great, quality software"" to ""out of this world""... and that is exactly where it belongs. If it won't even run at an acceptable speed on a year old computer, it isn't worth running. Stick with Norton 2004, that's what I am going to do.Thumbs WAY DOWN on this one."
1,I'm scared stiff,Symantec should fix the glitches in this software. I tried the download service but pament method was rejected- same payment mode for all my amazon.com purchases.But to my utter consternation the antivirus portion of my 2004 NIS has been knocked out by symantec. But for reading the reviews od=f 2005 I would not have known that it came with a spitting cobra! eanwhile I am constantly reminded that my NIS2004 expires in a rapidly diminishing number of days.Add the ominous warning about the uncertainty of my antivrus status and you have a bag of nails. All for attempting to purchase a product meant to give me rest of mind.
1,Stay away!,Stay away from this program! I am running the program on a Dell Pentium lll with Windows XP. Norton hogs the machine's memory and has slowed the machine down to be virtually unusable at time. Norton's tech support (email only) will accept no responsibility and offers no assistance other than to blame other programs. Stay away!
1,Danger - Norton Internet Security 2005 upgrade,"If you have an older version of Norton 2004 or earlier, Stick with it - DO NOT upgrade. I had to spend a whole day sorting my PC out from hang ups (and in XP sp2). I have eventually stabilised by PC and worked out that NAV works all be it slowly with the Anti spam element disabled. The anti spam element was probably its biggest problem and I am going back to Spamihilator (free).In short this Norton is a dog.David"
1,BEWARE THE INSTALL OF THIS PROGRAM,"I bought the download version as an upgrade to NIS 2004, which I was reasonably pleased with. The install screwed up somewhow and I was unable to uninstall it without a LOT OF WORK. Finally, after may hours of wasted time, I was able to do a complete uninstall of anything related to Symantec, and then my NIS 2005 install worked (so far). This involved running 3 different registry editing utilities from Symantec, manually editing the registry, deleting temp files, deleting installed files, deleting shortcuts and deleting drivers, restoring Microsoft programs, etc. The Symantec web-site contains a lot of duplicate and/or conflicting information on the topic. What a mess."
1,Awfull,"Horrible software. Overpriced. Resource hog so bad you wouldnt believe. It will make the fastest computer slow to a crawl.I recently removed this garbage from my computer and the results were amazing. I had a speedy functional computer again. There are a few separate standalone programs that, combined, do a better job that norton intercrap security. One more thing, if you try to remove it be prepared to spend a few hours to actually remove all the junk the un-installer leaves behind. Their site is a maze. Customer support is awfull. I will never buy any of their products ever again. This software sucks."
4,It's good for me,"The program is easy to use. It prevent people to watch your private information. Also, I love its Ad Blocker and Pop-up killer since they block only unwanted content accurately which is different to other software. Finally I love its updating tool (though find out errors sometimes) especially Live Update express. It's really quick and fast. Unlike Mcafee which need me to allow crazy active X control all the time. Its virus scanning tool is quite impressive. Nevertheless, the live support is bad and automatic program control suck which need me to restart my computer. It's aloso resource-hungry program and eat a lot of space in your computer."
1,this product does not include anti-spyware,"This product claims to protect your personal information, but it does not. This product does not have anti-spyware, nor does it prevent spyware from entering your computer. I think they should at least warn about the fact that it does not have anti-spyware. I get spyware in my computer, almost every week. It is very common. If you want to keep your personal information safe and not become a victim of identity theft, get a product that does a better job of protecting your personal information."
1,Only a Geek Could Love It.,"One star for this rating could be a little generous. NIS came pre installed on my new Dell 4700 so that was no problem. What is a problem is that I cannot figure out how to enable file sharing over my LAN. The help file for Personal Firewall is clear and concise on that subject. Unfortunately, it seems to have been written for a different version of the program because nowhere does it apply to what I have. So, here I am on Amazon looking to see if there is a third party book that will explain what I need to know."
4,First time Norton user....,"I had been having problems with my Windows firewall, I kept getting booted offline every five - ten minutes, especially when my mail came in. I took a chance when I bought this product at a secondhand store, brought it home, booted it up, firewall problem disappeared, and I've been happy ever since. I'm no techo but I know a computer that runs better than it did before. I have had absolutely no problems."
1,Agree with the other disappointed buyers; I give up on Norton Internet Security,I just couldn't change firewall permissions unless I disabled Norton Internet Security. If I didn't my PC would freeze (and the only way out is unplug the power; even pressing the power button wouldn't help).One LiveUpdate corrupted the program itself and now it just wont run the scan (no matter how many times I uninstall/reinstall this crap).
1,"Product OK, Company Support BAD",The product works OK. It does block a lot of stuff; however it did let a Trojan Horse through which resulted in having to wipe out my harddrive and rebuild.The biggest negative is Symantec's support. THERE IS NONE! Also you can forget getting any rebate from the company. The simply don't approve them.
1,Buggy,Keep getting Internet Exployer script error when manually adding programs to the Personal Firewall. Emailed tech support - no answer. Support webpage says may take 4 - 5 days for email support. Who debugged this crap anyway?????
1,Not for the faint of heart,"The is the single most frustrating experience, bar none, that I have ever had in 10 years of computing both at home and professionally. It actually works too well, preventing computers on your own home network from connecting without adminstrator intervention. I have removed every trace of it that I can find from my computer and could not recommend it to anyone who does not have extensive patience and experience. The only unpaid customer support is the 'knowledge base'. To talk to a real person, you need above average persistence to 1st, actually find a phone number and 2nd, wait on hold upwards of one hour to actually talk to someone, which you pay handsomely for. Buy only if you really enjoy frustration and don't already have enough in your life."
1,Worst software I have ever used,"I have had nothing but problems since using this product for the last five months. I have had to re-install over one dozen times and have had to re-format my hard drive three times.The program monopolizes all the memory resources on my computer while rendering many applications ineffective. I will never buy a Symantec product again. I documented my concerns at Symantec's website, but they never got back with me. Total lack of professionalism and total lack of a quality product."
1,Be very careful,"Upgraded to 2005 from 2003. After install, all drives for removable media are inoperable. No Cd-rom, no floppy. All return message that drive is not available, incorrect function.The Cd-roms will ply audio, just not data. Can't restore a backup, can't reinstll operating system, just dead in water.Others are having this issue, do a google search for ""incorrect Function"" You will find the issue in XP and Win 2000.BE careful. It is a shame because the prior version was so good.A NEW ISSUE: This product continues to prompt me for activiation..even though I have activated at least 4 times. Of course, when is decides that I need to activate, all internet securtity fucntions are disabled. Brilliant.Norton has done themselves and their customers a real disservice by releasing this product.I used to recommend Norton wholeheartedly, not any more!!"
1,JUNK *********,I have Internet Security 2003 When I tryed to install that 2005 it disconnected my internet it took 3 days talking to tech suppot just to get my internet up and running. if you have an older vesion of any Norton product you have to remove it. Take my advice DO NOT BUY THIS !!!!!unless you have hours of free time!!!!
3,2005 NORTON INTERNET SECURITY,"WORKS WELL AFTER MANY PROBLEMS/HOURS INSTALLING THE PROGRAM, COMPARED TO MCAFEE ANTIVIRUS PACKAGE, STILL DO NOT KNOW ABOUT IF I HAVE THE FIREWALL INSTALLED PROPERLY...MISS A PHONE CONTACT, AND THE POSSIBILITY OF DISCUSSING THE NORTON SOFTWARE WITH A REAL PERSON"
2,Frequent crashes!,"I am very disappointed with Norton Internet Security 2005. After installing this software onto my PC, I experienced the ""blue screen of death"" frequently! When I uninstalled the program, this irritating problem was infrequent.However, this software was able to remove virus which were not detected by some free anti-virus software (eg. AVG-free edition). It was also able to scan my PC for virus in a shorter amount of time.But these mitigating factors are not strong enough to make this software a great product. The product is overpriced, customer support is mediocre and slows down the speed of my ancient PC (a Pentium II) considerably. Don't waste your money on this version. Hopefully, I hope that Symentec will do something constructively about these problems. As I am a big fan of Norton, this version of the program is a catastrophic disappointment to me."
1,Avoid!,"I hadn't used Symantec/Norton utilities in awhile, and thought I'd try again. The idea of a single app was very appealing. I quickly learned that in order to recieve email, I needed to shutdown the virus scan. The problem arises with a process named ""ccap.exe"". It does not happen all the time, but when recieving email, Outlook will freeze. Task manager shows ""ccap"" as using the majority of the system resources. This process can not be shutdown. I need to completely shut the system down, and then re-boot.Support? Once you find the right page that provides an email address, the response is ""un-install/re-install"" or ""msconfig"" FAQ type responses. I doubt anyone even reads the email, as I do try to explain my system had been fine for over a year, until I install their product. Very polite though.Avoid this ""all in one"" solution."
1,STAY AWAY FROM THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE!!!!,"I'm a computer professional who supports pc's for a living. I thought that buying this program would provide great protection for my wife's pc. WRONG! Norton sucks your resources and bogs down the memory and causes your system to run slower. I'm sorry to have wasted money on this program. If you have a wife like I do and she uses Incredimail, you're going to find that Norton constantly tries to block Incredimail from accessing the internet to check email. I've added Incredimail every week for the last month to the safe access list. Still, every week it blocks Incredimail. Want some help? Call Symantec to sit on the tech support phone line for twenty minutes then have some ignorant illiterate in India tell you to call Incredimail! Incredibly stupid program! I can't believe how bad this program's gotten. I'm going to switch my wife to Trend Micro PC Cillin. BEST PROTECTION! So, as my title states, STAY AWAY FROM THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE!!!!!"
1,Norton Internet Security is a complete waste of time & money.,"I purchased Norton and I have always used Norton as my anti-virus and firewall. I purchased Norton (again) last year and will not be renewing my subscription this year.This product is a joke.It completely slows down my laptop without reason (laptop is a high end IBM), it sends out a million messages for no apparent reasons and keeps asking to be un-installed and re-installed because one function or another is not working. Symantec really need to fix this software or lose all their customers."
1,My PC is better off without NIS 2005,"My PC is W982nd, 380K, and I use DSL. NIS 2005 offers the only real internet protection: it completely disables internet functionality. It used to just slow my PC down alot, but after a recent LiveUpdate update I had no internet capabilities whatsoever!! I tried uninstalling and reinstalling NIS 2005 twice and after each reinstall I was prevented from using the internet. Uninstalling it restores internet functionality. I can't be bothered with calling for technical support based on the repeated bad experiences I've had over the last couple of years. At this point why should I waste hours on the phone with less-than-helpful service professionals from another high tech company I used to like? If I want the kind of on-line protection NIS 2005 offers my PC I could achieve the same result much less expensively by cancelling my internet service. If I could reconsider my purchase I wouldn't bother buying NIS 2005."
1,Worst software ever!!! Do NOT buy this!!! It is a RIP-OFF!!!,"I bought the software and had to install it 5 times to make it somewhat work. It still does NOT work 100%. The spam protecten always makes Microsoft Outlook crash, therefore I had to deactivate it. The firewall randomly blocks applications every once and a while. The entire suite crashes at least once a week, which means you have to reboot the computer. My mail-in rebate has been denied twice, even though I submitted the correct stuff. I will probably take it to small claims court and Better Business Bureau soon.You are much better off buying the Zonealarm Pro5 security suite, which got better ratings than Norton anyway."
1,NIS will make your computer lethargic,"Norton Internet Security 2005 will completely take over your system processing time bringing your computer to its knees!!. NIS will protect your PC, but it will also convert a P4 2.66 GHz with 768MB RAM in to a lethargic computer. For NIS to run it uses more than 21 processes that take almost 40MB of your valuable system RAM, it is absurd.Worst of all, try to access their inexistent support... you don't have the right for even one call. They only take calls from corporate customers/products.Go for some other product, RUN AWAY! don't use this one!. I did not followed others reviews, what a big mistake!!"
1,Norton Internet Security is appalling,"I have always used Norton antivirus, and had no problems with it at all. I have recently had to migrate to Outlook 2003 and Norton IS 2005 and have non-stop system crashes. I have now uninstalled it and resinstalled my old version of Norton Professional and hey presto everything is working again - and not talking two hours to load."
1,What a Lemon!!!,"I like new things so I upgraded to Norton 2005 from 2004. What a mistake! It kept shutting down and telling me I had a serious error which I kept reporting. It refused to let me access the internet unless I disabled the Firewall despite configuring it and reducing the protection level, till I was blue in the face! I uninstalled and reinstalled thinking something had gone wrong in the installation but to no avail. I went onto Symantec's website and tried out their fixes but they didn't work. I gave up and a computer teckie friend recommended MacAfee. I have only had one problem with it and that has been that it says my Privacy Service is disabled when it isn't. At least I can now access the internet without worrying."
1,Burns up tons of Ram,"I was very disipointed in Internet Security 2005. Besides taking up tons of hard drive space, it uses the majority of your ram. You cannot run more than two programs at once because it has no ram to run on. It also caused my advance businuess computer to overload often. Good protection, bad software."
5,Norton Internet Security,"One software takes care of most needs for safely working on the net. This replaces the need for multiple different softwares, often competing with each other. Does its work quietly."
2,"Gave it a Two because it does work, if you can get it installed","This product just sucks when it comes to instaltion. Right out of the box, I knew I would throw it away and stay with 2002. I had to call (my internet was down) and read to an automated system 46 numbers then listen to each set being read back, then finally listening to another set of 46 numbers to activate the system. Took forever to load and update, then there was a noticeable difference in my system response. Even the boot up took longer. You can't get up with anyone in support. Norton makes millions but try and get one person to talk to you. Customer Service is none existent. They want you to go through reams of webpages, some not working right and others taking you around in a circle. I'll think very carefully before buying another Norton or Symantec product. They use to be fine, but the later versions are too bulky and slow your system down too much."
3,Norton Internet Security.,Agree with what I've read in technical publications about this product -- it is a real system resource hog. Will slow an older system to a crawl and put a dent in the performance of newer ones. Can obtain the same level of protection with other vendor's products. Do your research. Uninstalled my Norton halfway through the purchased period.
3,"older version ok, but newer ones. . .",Used Norton 2005. Upgraded to 2006.Norton 2006 slowed my machine down to a crawl.Went to ZoneAlarm. Very happy with it.Always try to wait for Free-After-Rebate deals on these if you can. All I've paid for any of these is sales tax and/or shipping for the past five years.
1,Norton Internet Security 2005,"Installation is automatic. It changed several desktop icons to the square blue border window. It obliterated PanicWare, an excellent and free pop ad blocker. Zone Alarm disappeared. I had Norton systemworks 2005 installed and demanded reinstallation. I could not use email anymore with my Outlook Express, with no receiving and no sending e mails at all. To connect to the Web I had to disable Norton Internet Security first. Some icons from my desktop lost the shortcut properties and I could not start their associated programs. In summary: a total disaster. Solution: Remove the full program and reinstall Norton Systemworks. This program is as bad as it gets and will only tarnish the good reputation of Symantec."
2,NIS 2005 blocks stock tickers,"I recently installed NIS 2005 because tech support was no longer available on my NIS 2003. Unfortunately, the new version blocks streaming stock quotes from my online broker. I'm unable to connect to the servers streaming the quotes, despite unblocking Java applets and all the other supposed fixes, such as authorizing AutoBlock to ignore specific server IP addresses. Tech support runs $29.95 per incident. Email support is boilerplate and worthless. A tech at my online brokerage indicated that the problem with NIS was well-known and their contact with Symantec thus far unsuccessful in finding a fix. Wish I could recommend an acceptable product for any fellow active traders/day traders, but I'm just now looking at the competition."
3,sloppy work,"I didn't have a problem getting NIS 2005 installed on my computer, but I had to try to fix a problem on another computer. Never did figure out why it wouldn't load properly, but it did finally turn itself on after a couple of remove/install attempts. NIS is sluggish. It seems to be running Live Update frequently. My computer slows down at strange times now. The notices are vague. I just got one saying a remote computer was attempting to contact mine, so I blocked it. It blocked Internet Explorer! Whoever approved this mess for sale at Symantec should be fired!"
1,Not Recommended,This product halved the speed of my computer as well as allowed it to be keylogged and riddled with undetected spyware and adware.
1,these people aren't exaggerating,"this software is useless. within a few weeks of installing this on my new computer a trojan came through that completely locked up my computer, causing me to format the hard drive. luckily i had back-ups of everything but it was a real pain. it caused me to lose complete faith in the product. not only that, it is slow, and it's true what others have written....it is a complete memory hog. i took my techies advice and installed the free version of antivir and it rocks. my computer is noticeably faster without norton. don't waste your money on this garbage."
1,awful,"Bought the product, after a week of dealing with it, still I am not being able to make it work properly.Every time I raise the security level, I loose my internet connection.I tried to uninstall, but when I do that, the Antivirus remain, and you have no other option to remove it than to download a software from Symantec to uninstall. As a result, PC is acting weirdAdvise. Stay away from it. It'll will ruin your PC"
2,more problems than solutions,"Since I installed this software I have more problems than solutions, all the time my programs don't work well, and my computer run slow (I have 512 of ram, pentium 4), If you want a software that protect you maybe only the antivirus are going to be ok. I hate the pop-up windows for ""security"", makes my work more dificult I'm really desapointed of this product."
1,corrupted norton,"First piece of advise. Do not download these programs. Order the software so if it gets corrupted you have a program to reinstall.Last year my Norton became corrupted. My computer was ready to crash when I called nOrton. They enabled me to download the new version. It did not remove adware which slowed down the computer and caused many problems. I bought Adaware and that removed over 1500 ads etc in one month! Norton became corrupted again. My computer AGAIN was unable to operate with 'bad image' messages popping up every 30 seconds. Norton wanted me to pay again for the lousy software.This is all in a 18 month period. Is it unreasonable to hope that I should be able to renew for a fee without buying the program every year? If it cannot keep its own program from being corrupted, how can it protect my computer? It doesn't!"
1,No support,Oct 04 I purchased an extension to my subscription. Two weeks ago I received an upgrade to their live update program. After the upgrade I can down load but not install new virus definitions. Technical support suggested some solutions that did not work. The last solution was to uninstall and buy a new program. I suppose that is one way to drum up profits.
4,Workable but Slow and Install Apprehensively,"2005 NIS is ok, once and once it's installed.But you better have a powerful PC to drive itand be expected to have to try 7-10 timesto get the anti-virus list updated.Weird thing is that you cannot copy junk mail idsto posted on the SPAM Blocked List but would haveto type each one in."
4,Works for me.,"I was a bit concerned about purchasing this product considering the statements here. But, i ended up getting it anyway. What i did was to uninstall the 2 previous programs i had. NIS 2004 and NAV 2003 i believe. Then i used a registry cleanup program i was sent by the makers of my PC that was sent to me for an unrelated problem. After that i installed NIS 2005 without any problems at all. It has been running fine on my PC for about 2 months now."
1,Norton Internet Security 2005,"The product installed easily, but prevents my PC from accessing the printer and the Internet thru IE. It also won't allow me to access My Computer. By turning off all features but antivirus, the printer and My Computer work sporadically. The manual and the on-line help are very sparse and of little help. I may be missing something, but as currently packaged this product is not designed for the mass market."
1,Still has the dreaded activation policy,"Don't install the product on a weekend or after 5pm west coast time. If you do and have problems with activation, like I did, you'll be left with a vulnerable computer. The fix will be to wait 1hr or 2 online for a customer support technician.Get Mcafee Internet Security Suite 2005 instead. No activation required."
1,"Bad news, waste time like it's water","Get used to seeing this:Error caused by Symantec Corporation: No specific solution foundProblem DescriptionAn analyst at Microsoft has investigated this problem and determined that an unknown error occurred in Client and Host Security Platform (ccapp.exe). This software was created by Symantec Corporation.Problem ResolutionMicrosoft has researched this problem with Symantec Corporation, and they do not currently have a solution for the problem that you reported. Below is a list of recommendations to take that may help prevent the problem from recurring."
1,Poor piece of software,If you are a novice computer user and stay with the default settings then be prepared for many hours of tech support calls.Pulling out your internet connection from the wall would give you less headaches.Here is one example of my many problems:I went to do some online banking and found that I couldn't pay a bill because there was no 'Submit' button on the web page. Norton Internet Security cut it out. When I turned off NIS everything worked again.
1,Another thank you,Thanks to all the reviews I have saved myself from another headache!! I purchased Mcaffee internet suite before reading the reviews and planned to return it and purchase this product. NOT!!I will still return the Mcaffee due to the bad reviews but I may just renew the Norton subscription!!! Hmmm let me check out Zone alarm first!
5,"Action Packed, Baby!","The first two volumes were really great, however, this one takes the cake. Ep. 5 is a fast paced thrill ride with a nicely done gunfight sequence and a flashback sequence that explains more on Spikes past. Ep. 6 aint bad either. Its about a kid who cant grow and is kind of a mix between Akira and Blue Seed. Anyway, this volume is in comparision with an action title here or in Japan. Definetly worth buying."
5,DARN GOOD!,a director could've made the 3rd episode ballad of fallen angels a john woo movie. the mystery was laid out well and the action was great! one of the most exciting cowboy bebop episodes i've seen so far!
2,Why reuse Check My Eyelids For Holes?,"One of the most annoying things can be when a group is unable to come up with enough B-Sides for a single, so they just use a song already available on the album. This was the fifth single from thsi album, and it suggests that it was one too many. The only new track, otehr than a scarcely different remix of the lead track, which the group themselves felt was pointless, was a cover. And not a spectacular one either. The video was okay but in those days the technical quality wasn't as high, and their later videos where they spoofed various films are much more interesting. Don't bother payign import price for this one."
3,Ultimate Pirate Collection which some seemed not so piratey,"It all came to me in one piece and the clarity was as good as one could get on a few of them that where extremely old.My husband is enjoying them.Seems like a good mix..I would recommend it to anyone that is a die-hard pirate fan if they dont mind some real oldies in here,like back in the 30's..a couple of movies though I questioned with they where in the category of pirates,though they where high seas adventure stories.It was worth the money."
3,PIRATE COLLECTION,"NOT SURE IF ITS EXACTLY WHAT I THOUGHT I WOULD BE BUYING, THERE WERE SOME MODERN MOVIES AMONGST THEM, NOT MODERN BLACK AND WHITE,OKAY, BUT NOT SWASH BUCKLING, SWORDS ETC, LIKE I LOVE, THE ONES WHICH WERE ,WERE GREAT,BUT ALL THE SAME I STILL ENJOYED THE PACK...WORTH GETTING IF YOU LIKE BLACK AND WHITE, AND OLD JONDRA"
1,The Ultimate Pirate Collection,The only good part of the whole box set is the 14 Adventures of Long John Silver. I couldn't even get through most of the rest. I was born in the 70's not the 40's. I wouldn't even bother with collection if I was you.
1,Nothing Happened,We followed all the instructions per the letter for this thing - but nothing happened. We did not have any plants even begin to sprout. It was almost a complete waste of our money and time.
3,Venus Fly Trap,The seeds took a very long time to sprout. They have finally almost two months later. We are in winter in Nebraska. I think a warmer season would make it more fun. Hopefully as the weather warms and our house is a little warmer the growth will speed up.
1,doesn't work,"Plant didn't grow.have had it for weeks and still nothing happens.Till this day I water it, yet not growing.Not recommended.Don't waste your money."
2,Misleading,"I was very disappointed to find that this was not for actual flytrap plants, but for a tiny group of six seeds, plus dirt and a plastic container and lid. Oh, and a little plastic snake."
2,READ BEFORE YOU BUY,I bought this almost 3 years ago and only 3 of the seeds survived and the plants are less than an inch tall! The picture completely misleads you. They need TONS of care but it all pays off.
2,doesnt work,"you gotta moniter this kit frequently, i left mine alone for about a month and when i next checked on it the dirt was peeling up and all the blue rocks and plastic reptiles were in a corner. This piece of junk isnt growing even after like 4 months."
1,Motor Guide Velco Strap,This strap was to short for my trolling motor application. I have a Motorguide SW55 and the this strap is at least 10 inch short. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated.
2,Lesser Vicente Fernandez film.,"This film takes place during the Mexican revolution and deals with the story of a revolutionary fighter and an upper class woman who meet and who he has to tame to his way of thinking, although the film begans trying to recreate the era by the middle of the film the director seems to have forgotten it's supposed to be a period film, the film has many sexist ideas and treats the female character like a thing that has to be tamed to the man's way of thinking by the end of the film the whole story falls apart and what could have been a better film is lost by it's mediocre story and the bad acting of the lead actress Julieta Rosen, what results is a tired formulaic movie with no new ideas."
5,"A thoughtful, well researched biography","This is an excellent, well written book which fills in many of the details of the Marshal's life which he omitted from his memoirs. His modesty and sense of privacy caused him to neglect to discuss many aspects of his life, his achievements, feelings, concerns with social reform, and a few events which he might have considered to be failures. The book presents a clear picture of a very complex and honorable man liing in turbulant times. He comes through as a very human person.There are a great many details of his life which I have never before read. I highly recommend this book to those who hold the Marshal in high esteem and to any who enjoy reading about very accomplished MAN."
5,One out of two aint bad,"For Numan fans looking for ""Living Ornaments 79/80 you're halfway there.The double cd has the complete 79 show with tracks not found on the original LP.Sadly this set does not have the 80 show(see track list).Still a must for the Numan fan(especially early GN).Hopefully someone will release the 80 show as well done as this."
5,GReat,"I love these books because they have the classics, yet they are able to be played by a novice. It also brings back childhood memories"
3,Mirror cosmetic Organizer,"The product is as described but the 10x mirror is way more than I need and I can't see out of that side. I will use it, but still need another one with a larger cosmetic tray."
3,10x Mirror/Organizer,"I got this mirror because my vision is poor and it is difficult to see my brows and facial hair. I like the idea of having a small organizer attached.Although it says its a 10x, I still have problems seeing everything. I think it may be either the quality of the mirror or its just not strong enough for me. The other con is it's also a bit top heavy."
3,Nice HRM,"It has its problems but overall a good HRM.Have trouble resetting the Lap and for some reason, in this mode, it keeps stopping at 1 hr 39 minutes????Oh well, it seems accurate when it comes to my heart rate and thats what I bought it for..."
2,FINGERS DON'T WORK,"I HAVE USED IT FOR ONLY TWO WEEKS AND THE FINGERS SENSOR HEART RATE START TO SHOW A WRONG 240 HEART RATE EVERYTIME I TOUCH THE SENSORS, WITH THE STRAP IS WORKING PERFECT BUT THE TOUCH SENSOR IS VERY BAD."
1,too complex,I had a heart rate monitor before so I am familiar with how they work but this one was alittle too complex for me ... the manual wasn't the best because I followed the directions and it didn't work so take your chances
4,good stuff,I have used this stuff for years.It is hard to find sometimes.I give the granules to my dog and cats and they all like it.
5,One of the best combat books I have read!,"After serving in the M-2 Bradley's for some years, this book is a welcome site for the other infantrymen around. The commands are realistic. And, the pace is very good. While reading this book I relived all of my experiences in the field. This book was as good his his first, ""Team Yankee""."
2,Yamabushi's mini reviews pt. IV,"Yikes, is this the same person that wrote Team Yankee? Plodding and tedious, this is a 4 hour movie that should have been 2."
4,Good combat story,"As all of Coyle's books, Sword Point doesn't disappoint. The descriptions and explanations for novices are good. Character development is weak, as with all of Coyle's books."
5,Yeah!! BAby !!,"Got it as a preventive maintenance item, -nice!!Gas mileage went up!! Car runs smoother ,, idles much smoother !Also hee hee the car is hot to trot now!!!(faster)IN one year will get back to see how its performing to let everyone know. Nice!!"
5,"love them, but won't pay @$25 for shipping - that's insane","These are fantastic and I wish there were more flavors and free shipping as an Amazon.com prime item. I found them in Wildwood, NJ while on vacation and have not been able to find them back at home in Baltimore, MD. I hope that some day they become part of Amazon.com prime as I will definitely stock up for those hot evenings. Hayes"
5,tasty,"These things are great. They never freeze solid, they're always slushly. And each one is only 60 calories."
5,Wonderful book,"This book does a good job of analytically breaking down sleep processes, and, having shown the reader a theoretical goal, proceeds to put together elements which, if practiced, will help to realize it. I have noticed increased awareness of dreams since following some of the basic instructions, and suggestions on sleeping posture have allowed me to choose if i want to dream or not on a given night. A worthwhile book to anybody interested in their own mental well being who doesn't always get a good night's sleep, though as instructions for actions, simply knowing the words written will not do it."
4,great book,"The book talks about general aspects of daily life, relationships with persons and situations and how they affect and condition our atittude towards life. The author gives some simple advice on how to see reality as it really is and not to let anger and hate, that frequently affect ourselves in the stressed world of today, generate. It also describes the practice of dream yoga for the those most interested. The dream Yoga is a very interesting issue and the author also explains the diference of the dream meaning between eastearn and weastern views. I recommend this book for everyone interested in understanding theirselves, in bringuing positiveness, concentration, awareness into their lives and relations. The autor uses a very simple and sincere language and I can tell by his writting he is a very kind and humble beeing. This is not the ""101 secrects of whatever book"". This is a ver true book which I belive you'll enjoy and consult for several times."
5,Fantastic Book - extremely well written,"Even though this book is about dream and sleep Yoga it contains one of the best - non-technical, non dogmatic explanations of karma I have ever read. It also has a great explanation of non-duality. The entire book is written in an exceptionally clear manner with wonderful explanations and a great glossary. I cannot recommend this book highly enough."
5,wOw!,"mIND bENDING WORK I REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK AS IT HAS TRUELY ENGLIGHTEN ME WITH NOT WASTING MY TIME ASLEEP, BUT TO INSTEAD DEVELOP LUCIDITY TO OBTAIN LIBERATION FROM THIS 5 (SENSES) LIMITED WORLD!"
1,WAY too small.,"Despite being labelled as ""Extra Large,"" that size was only 19"" in circumference -- WAY too small to fit my knee.Consider yourselves warned."
4,Rustoleum bottom paint,"Product looks to be just fine although I don't recommend order paint online.Its nothing short of a miracle that the paint cans didn't explode all over. They were not packaged correctly and are so beat up I am not sure if the lids will go back on.Even though the paint is good, I received product that looked like it fell off a truck."
1,spilled paint in shipping,the small amount of paint that was left from the poor shipping that led to leaked paint mess...seemed to be good paint. there was a small can of paint in a much larger box with very little packing material in it to protect the can=the can leaked.
2,Good but outdated information,"Basically the methods described in this book are variations of a system using 2liter soda bottles, pvc piping and plywood for the reservoir. No doubt would the systems work but they are *much* more complicated + require more work than is needed to grow good grass. Also, you'll need to find the old-school soda bottles (the ones with a cap on the bottom) which I couldn't and have access to powertools. There is a good step-by-step section and nice pics too, but it's not enough to make it a good buy. Trust me, you'll save yourself *much* work by using a rubbermaid storage tote, grow cups and rockwool/peat pellets than the methods described in Pot for Pennies. Go for something written by Jorge Cervantes instead, that dude's got it down."
2,Out Of Date Info....,"This book was useful in 1998 but A LOT has transpired since then!! The ""grow industry"" is much like computers...new stuff comes out all the time!!! It seems appropriate at this time to publish a completely updated version!!! If you want really good and up-to-date info, get Cervantes' latest update to the indoor bible...good luck to all from the Goddess of Ganja!!!"
2,I really wanted to like this,"Ok, so I have had this video for a LONG time. I really didn't like the videos that came with the total gym so I decided to go with this DVD. First off, it comes with TWO dvds that COULD be put into ONE, its just bulky. Each of the day workouts are 15 min long but I didn't really get a good feel for the instructor and I thought the music was bad. Its really not what I was expecting or hoping for. I don't think they really put a lot of time and effort in making this video and I have found MUCH better video's on YOUTUBE for FREE. It also bothered me that there is no INFO on this video until you put it in. No Reviews, no clips, and very little info. Now I KNOW why and I am here to tell you, this is not probably what you are looking for. They need to be MORE informative."
5,Well-told story with beautiful illustrations,"What a surprising pleasure. This book arrived as a gift and it is beautiful. The classic story is told in a voice that every child will adore, and the pictures are so lively that every reader becomes enraptured. Very nice and a great gift."
3,HUGE scoops of icecream,"I bought this to replace my mom's ""pampered chef"" ice cream scoop that the liquid had come out of after the end cap had met with some corrosion... I didn't know what size to get, so I guessed. This thing makes HUGE scoops of ice cream! If you like big scoops, it is fine. I think I'd prefer more smaller scoops.MOST IMPORTANT THING: I didn't think the liquid inside really did the job of making the ice cream easier to scoop the way the other brand scoop did. I picked this one though because I noticed it was the same brand William Sonoma sold."
3,Not quite what I had expected,"I bought this scoop for my mom as she has difficulty scooping hard frozen ice cream with standard scoops. This scoop is a nice large scoop. However the heat transfer doesn't just allow you to easily scoop as it would sound in the description, especially if you are scooping multiple servings."
1,had some weird chemical reaction,"got this, used it 2X and washed by hand, the metal on the outside has had some type of chemical reaction and turned black and crusty. wtf this thing is going back."
5,best of the best,"buy it once and have it for life. The size of the scoop is perfect - not to big/ small. A great gift, most will not spend this amount of $ to buy themselves the scoop. Pricy = yes, excellent= yes."
1,grey powder in ice cream,"Excellent ice cream scoop, works as advertised. Not dishwasher safe, so as long as you and every single kid who ever uses it remembers not to put it in the dishwasher, you're ok. If one person forgets, you have grey powder in your ice cream. My family and friends are not that smart so now I have to look for a dishwasher safe scoop."
2,Where's The Greatness?,I purchased this for my husband as a gift. He hated it and wants are old one back. Even using hot water didn't make this thing scoop properly. Why such good reviews?
3,Not All It's Cracked Up to Be,"With all the great reviews of this product, I was expecting terrific performance. I didn't find that it scooped hard ice cream any better than an average scoop. What I have used it successfully for is scooping meat to make meatballs - it is just the right size. Overall, disappointing product."
1,WARNING VERY DANGEROUS - EXPLODED IN HAND,"My Wife was using this scoop this evening as we have for 10+ years. She scopped ice Cream for our company, and then went to rinse it off in the sink when it exploded causing severe damage to her hand. It even dented the ceiling as it blasted off from of the sink. Strangest accident I ever heard of, but this product is not safe. The water temp from the faucet was cool, not even warm."
5,Cold scooping goodness...,"Sometimes a product is so perfect and so simple, you just have to hold it in your hand. And if that product happens to be an ice-cream scoop, well, that means satisfaction is at hand."
4,Safe -- but don't use the dishwasher.,"Ice cream scoops like this one cannot be run through the dishwasher. I forgot once, and the scoop came out discolored. That's probably what ""Dan from Utah"" experienced. I replaced it, and haven't forgotten again."
4,works decently but not flawless,This product claims to require almost no effort in scooping ice cream and that the ice cream slides right off. It stil requires a decent amount of wrist action and you need to shake the scooper a bit to release the ice cream. Make sure you shake the scooper to get the fluid moving and heat conducted - the scooper works much better this way.
5,Great scoop!,"Well designed, good looking product. The shape of the scoop is efficient and quite effective; makes easy the work of scooping hard ice cream."
5,Absolutely fantastic!,This ice cream scoop is amazing! Loosens the edges of the hardest frozen product without turning it into a melted mess. Highly recommended!
2,Nothing special,I agree with the reviewer who said this scoop does not work any better than a traditional scoop.This is nothing special and it's a bit overpriced considering that is does not make scooping hard ice cream any easier.Safe your hard earned money.
4,"Graphics are good, for the xbox and the sounds are good, but not great.","It's a sim and pretty complicated, especially if you know jack about cars. The sounds are ok. For the price you can get for it nowadays, you really can't go wrong. I'd say if your a car enthusiast and your looking for a new game to play without breaking your wallet doing these pressing economic times, go for it. If you're more of a arcade driving fan, you'll get bored quickly."
5,Great for all styles of driving.,"If you like drifting, adjust your settings, and you can. If you just like to customize cars, you can do that. This is an amazing game, and for the price...just buy it."
3,This isn't Grand Turismo for sure!,"Graphics are OK, the ""feel"" isn't nearly as good as many racing games I've played. I often found myself braking too late. Who knows, maybe this game is more realistic than most, but it sure doesn't feel like it."
4,Great Game! Bummer about replay...,"I loved this game I was a huge GT series fan and actually went and got an Xbox because of all the great pics and reviews. Just a few points I didn't like or had issues with.a. I play 2 player mode alot with my buddy. No rearview mirror, and no instant replay! That was really a bummer, that was some of the most fun with Gran Turismo going through and watching the replay after a good couch race!b. Tough to gauge the speed your going, I got used to this a bit. But GranTurismo it's easier to tell if your locking up the brakes or just gauging your speed going into corners.It is an absolutely beautiful game and you will love it!"
2,"Nice, but Gran Turismo or Project Gotham 3 is better.","Forza is a decent game but I can't help but compare it to Gran Turismo 3 for PS2 or Project Gotham 3 for xbox 360. Mainly because of the fact that it doesn't have an inside (cockpit) view. I hope Forza 2 coming out for the 360 will have this option. For a true simulator, like what Forza claims to be, an inside view is essential. It's just not realistic seeing only the road in front of you.NOTE: I'm playing Forza which was originally developed for regular Xbox on an Xbox 360 console. I was able to download an update as soon as I loaded the game, but there are still glitches. Mainly the car's sound that I'm driving dissappears (but not the other cars) on most of the harder tracks. This is rather annoying as I rely a lot on the sound of my engine when I'm racing."
5,Standard fare for a professional wardrobe,"This is my second pair of Franco Sarto ""Nolan"" in Coffee (also have a second pair of black). They are so comfortable and professional looking. You can wear them year round - they work with practically any pants. My first pair lasted about 3 years with a lot of wear. I was so glad to find another pair. They are a faithful staple to any wardrobe!"
1,False advertising of shoe,This shoe was not the soft glove leather made in Brazil. It was a cheap shoe made in China. The sewing was not good nor was the shoe the one I ordered two other times.I contacted Shoe Mall...they looked at their stock and confirmed none were made in Brazil.They sent a return slip out quickly and said the refund had been processed over two weeks ago. I still see them advertising on Amazon the excellent shoe made in Brazil...this needs to change. I have no refund on my card and am upset with the service provided by Shoe Mall through Amazon.
3,"The shoe is not a ""D"" width",This shoe is a good quality shoe but is by no means a W shoe. It is in fact on the narrow side.
2,Comfy - but not stylish or attractive,"These shoes are comfy, but the first thing I thought when I open the box was ""these look like old lady shoes!"" Although the side view photo shows a trim, it's not noticeable to the real eye, leaving the shoe looking big, black and clunky. I've had other similar Franco Sarto shoes and they've all had much better styling than these.I'm keeping the shoes because they are comfortable and I like the heel height/thickness, but had I been store shopping, I never would have even given them a second glance."
4,Size varies,"I purchased a brown pair in size 5 1/2. I LOVED THEM. Fit nice and so comfortable. I liked so well I decided to buy a black paid. Although the same size, unless it was marked incorrectly, the next pair was very tight. I didn't want to send them back, so I am using the shoe stretcher to remedy the problem."
3,"One shoe great, the other shoe flawed","One shoe was perfect. The other shoe looked ok, however, when you put it on the in the middle on the left side of your foot the support was gone, just thin material."
3,Terrible music from Brazil...?? It happens.,"This is a generously programmed 2-CD set... Too bad it's such terrible music. Sandra De Sa specializes in bland, lifeless, prefab modern soul, the stuff they once called ""quiet storm"" music. She aims at being Brazil's answer to Sade, but this ain't even that good. On the other hand, if you like this kind of stuff, it might be fun to hear it sung in Portuguese for a change."
2,Giddy-up Jimmy!,"Not the greatest Jimmy Smits movies--a bit bleak with the LA hooligan element, but some nice scenes with Jimmy and his kids. Have the 'fast forward' ready--lots of running around in the dark! But hey Jimmy--""we are your crew""!"
2,Too bad...,"It's such a pretty watch, too bad it doesn't work. It probably just needs a new battery - I don't know - but I'm used to new watches working right out of the box and with batteries running around $10 a pop, it's terribly disappointing. The back is a pain to open, too. I tried but it wouldn't budge and I'm afraid of scratching it up. Can't tell if it's a pop-off or screw-off type. The product insert is no help - it simply says how to set the time. :-("
3,only a single tune + remix,"I had hoped it was the full album, but it contains only the single track. The Norman Cook remix could easily be from his Fatboy Slim ""You've come a long way, baby"" disk. Its fine. The others don't deserve mention."
2,Not Kiss's best.,"80's Kiss. It's alright, but not the Kiss I really dig. Also, it;s only vidoes from the album."
1,Rock Bottom was on their third album.....,"...but KISS actually hit it with Crazy Nights. Three videos from this album are three to many. If you own this I hope it was a gift, otherwise you were ..."
5,Great low-budget CPU!,"I used this to build a pc for my grandparents, total cost around 250$! This one is just perfect for their non-intense use, like websurfing and videoconference, sending emails, etc. Perfect choice for the lowest self-built pc today."
1,Filled with errors.,"Compared to the other Kaplan SAT II books this one was a major disappointment. The material was poorly covered and the book is filled with small errors. While all the material is correct, there are many typograpphical errors and other errors that should have been caught by editors. There are many typos in the otherwise very helpful practice tests. Many questions are mispelled and the answers in the back do not match up with the same questions in the test. Kaplan was very sloppy with this one. However since this is their first edition the second may be better."
4,Shocking Tale of A Twisted Couple,This was a deep look into the lives of one of the worlds most twisted couples. I wonder how any of their children survived their childhoods.If people would have conacted child protective services or reported what they had seen to the police so many lives could have been saved.This couple were definantly out of touch with reality and living in some fantasy world full of sadomasochism.
4,great book,This book read's like fiction. So hard to believe that all of it really happened.If you like true crime then you must read this book.
3,Fred & Rose,"So-so writing with lots of repetition. The main draw of this book is the astonishing story of how these depraved people managed to assault so many innocent children for so many years, and fool the child welfare system. Sad, sad reading."
3,Went on a bit,I really enjoyed reading this book as I am fascinated by these two. However I found the courtroom scenes at the end a bit tedious
2,Not So Good,"I don't really see how you could call a book like this good anyway. But, I have read alot of true crime stories and I definitely thought this one is the worst. I don't feel it is very thorough. You read 4 chapters at the beginning ALL about the family history and then it just kind of jumps to everything happening. In my opinion it could have been written alot better."
5,book I ordered,The book I ordered from this person came right away...no waiting for it at all. I was surprised at how fast I got it. Thanks.Liz
4,Good read,"This sounds like a great fiction read for singles. Just keep your focus onto God and everything would fall into place. There were also some hilarious bits in this story. Very funny. Pudding got me cracking up.I checked this book out by another Christian based author. It sounds like it got some Caribbean flavor, so I got to big it up!Being One - No One is like No Other. High School- The next frontier. v. 1 (High School- the Next Frontier)"
2,"Cheap camera, cheap pics...","If you're looking for a camera that does the basics and bare minimal - THIS IS IT! It is a 3 in 1 camera that can record video w/o sound, work as webcam, and a digital camera. The pic quality is really poor and often blurry unless taken up close. Indoor pics come out dark, a lot of bright light is needed because the camera has no flash. It has an auto-off feature which helps to preserve battery life. I bought the camera to sell items on ebay and send email pics. That's all that it is great for. If you're looking for a camera for the kids - THIS IS IT. It's compact, lightweight, and sturdy. Just point and click!"
1,Would not install at all on Windows XP & beyond OS.,"Would not install at all on Windows XP & beyond OS! So unless you still have a working PC running Windows 2000 or prior OS, this will be a totally useless software for you that is not worth anything nowadays! As a result, it's not even worth $1.00 as the front package picture shown."
4,good book if you are a novice,It is a good book if you are a novice rider and considering your first horse. The pictures are lovely and the conversation between trainers is interesting but it did not give me any information i didn't already know that was important in helping me choose my next partner for dressage.
3,Odd book,"This wasn't the best book I have bought off amazon. I find that Anky's exerts contradict the main text by the author. Anky quite often begins her passages that she agrees with the author, then explains her view that doesn't necessarily agree with the author. If you are looking for some extra guidance on conformation and dressage, then by all means, give this book a try. However, do not take everything as gospel as there seems to be 2 point of views expressed in one book."
5,Wish I had read this as a teen!,"What a great surprise for a hot and steamy afternoon! I picked the book up to kill some time, maybe half hour or so... I mean, it is a book for young adults, and I am a 40 year old ""adult."" But I didn't put it down until midnight, the sun set, the moon rose, I forgot to eat dinner, and when I closed it, It was starving, and sleepy. And feeling fulfilled.I highly suggest this book, especially to young women, and even young men, it has some great insight on the tenderness of the heart.Going to recommend it to my son in a couple of years when he is heading into high school..."
3,"It's compelling, absolutely amazing!!!!","As a new freshman at West Albany High School, I can relate to the main character in this story, Johny Voodoo. A girl moves from the city to a small and really stcks out. She meets a boy and they fall in love. Many mistakes ti lead to dissaperance of the boy. This book is easy reading and keeps your attention the whole time. This book differs from other books because it has and open ended conclusion, it ends up leaving you thinking and thriving for the answers that were not answered.I would highly recomend this book to all tennagers. It will open your eyes to things that you never would of thought of before. I really loved this book!!!"
5,Cattle Capers,"Cattle Capers #1 was very fun to read. The characters are all original and real to the reader. Dawn Kravagna wrote this story with humor, mystery, and a love story about these great characters and I could not put the book down until I finished reading their worderful adventure"
2,The author presents a problem but no solutions.,"The author states ""We can take the Constitution away from the courts in several ways."" He then lists those methods, suggests a move to ""populist constitutional law"" which is ""a law oriented to realizing the principles of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution's Preamble"" and give scant clues about what any of the above really mean or how they can be carried out. He also says that his arguments for a populist constitutional law ""is [not] the only, or even the best, interpretation of the Constitution."" Reduced to simplicity then, the author is unhappy with the concept of judicial review and has nothing with which to replace it. I don't believe the author takes the arguments he propounds too seriously and neither should his readers."
2,waste of money,I have always enjoyed betty crocker cookbooks but was sorely disappointed with this publication. I will be more careful in the future.
1,Too Salty,"If you really like salty foods or lots of dark soy sause, then this might be for you.I'm not an expert chief, but I do cook quiet a bit of ethnic foods. I like my dishes to have a range of flavours that are pleasent to the palete and easy on the eyes.I found that most of the recipes looked good but following the directions caused me to throw them out because I couldn't stand the taste."
5,Restaurant quality food from your kitchen!,"Every recipe I've tried tastes like it's from a quality Chinese restaurant. The recipes are easy to understand, I can find the ingredients in my local market, and the finished quality is consistently delicious."
4,Better than the last one!,"I have been using Better Crocker's Chinese Cookbook for years. Our family certainly has many favorites from that edition. In fact, how I came to find out about Betty Crocker's New Chinese Cookbook is that I was trying to order copies of the original cookbook to give to my now adult children.I not only ordered the new book for them but for me, as well. The new book includes some of our past favorites, but plenty of new exiting dishes, as well."
1,Not a true Access Point.,"It is likely, if you are looking at an access point rather than a basic broadband router, that you are wanting more versatility in your wireless setup. If this is the case, this D*Link product is a waste of time. Despite being advertised as an Access Point (AP), the DWL-G700AP is not a true AP.There is no client AP mode (allows the AP to be a client to another AP), there is no wireless bridge mode, there is no wireless repeater mode. In fact, everything you would expect to see on an AP is missing. And D*link do not seem to be able to keep track of firmware releases properly either. My AP came with 1.03 which, according to D*Link does not exist.As such, it's virtually useless as anything other than a VERY basic access point. Buy the Linksys WAP54G instead and get a real AP."
1,Interesting Paperweight,"If you can get it configured, it will work. Be prepared to spend hours (literally) getting this unit to work with anything other than default settings. If you check the various forums, you'll see posts about firmware problems, and configuration issues. I use other D-Link products, and they're great, but I would avoid this one."
3,"Good, but....",I had and used this access point for 2 years. It worked ok but lately i had some problems about how stable was the network with this stuff. Some people recomended me shift to a router and sell this one (i did). They told me I had to be clear about the use of this item: it's a access point (for making one single IP address wireless) and not a router (for spliting one IP address to many wireless IP address). Honestly i realized a router gives you more if you plan to use it at home and... small and standard routers are as cheap as good access points. Nevertheless this item is great to connect your wire printer to a wireless network or use as a antena to spread the network far its original range.
1,False Information,"I purchased 2 of these items with the intention of setting one in the main area, and the second across the building in repeater mode. The box stated that you can extend a wireless network, and the manual stated that you can put the device in repeater mode. Unfortunately repeater mode DOES not exist on this device. I double-checked the firmware and verified I had the last version; the version the manual was written for. I contacted technical support and was escalated to higher support (after the call dropped twice I finally made it). After being put on hold for about 10 minutes while they discussed the issue, the support team came back stating that this device does NOT have a repeater function. When I inqured why the manual and box both says it can she said they are aware, and told me to pick up a DAP-1360."
1,Very limited usage,"This product seems to function ONLY as a Wireless Access Point. That is to say, it can take your wired system to wireless. This can NOT act as a bridge, nor, I suspect a repeater. Caveat emptor!"
1,Most Difficult Piece of Hardware to Install,I agree with most of the reviews regarding the difficulting in installing this wireless access point. I am no IT expert but have quite a bit of experience in installing and administering networking equipment in a large corporate environment. I was able to get a connection without any encryption but could not get the device to work with WEP or WPA. I eventually had our IT consultant configure the device but it took him about four hours. He had previously recommended that I go with Linksys but I didn't listen. I regret that decision.
1,"Online setup wizard doesn't work, so I can't configure","The URL that D-Link says you should go to in order to access the DWL-G700ap's configuration system doesn't load. Which means, you cannot configure the unit to make a unique name, set up security or have it work as an extendor to an existing system.I've tried loading the setup wizard from several ISPs, so that's not the problem. I've tried calling phone support, remaining on the phone in one instance for over 90 minutes, and haven't spoken to anyone. I've emailed their tech support several times, and have yet to receive a reply (not even an automated ""we got your email, expect a response""). Their online help site doesn't do anything other than point you at the same URL that doesn't work.So, I've spent $70 bucks on a thing I can't use. I'll never use D-Link products again."
2,DLink Access Point,"Signal strength for this unit, with an external antenna, is no better than thatof my Verizon Westell 7500 router with only an internal antenna. No advantage tothe external antenna that is delivered with the DLink."
2,NOT HAPPY,"I purchased this item and i am very unhappy. It never worked correctly, after two days of installing it it stoppede working. After installing for the second time it improved. However its range is not even 2 feet. I seriously do not recomend this item! there many other that are allot better tan this one."
1,Did not work out of the box.,"I normally have had good luck with D-Link products.Unfortunatley...this did not work out of the box for me. I was on the line with D-Link for a while before they told me to ""go back to the place where I purchased it from to get a refund or replacement"". Talked to a friend at work who had the same WAP and he had a similar experience.Buyer beware..."
4,Excellent Reference,"As a new collector of R.S. Prussia I found this book to be an excellent reference. It's detailed description and beautiful pictures of the different molds, decorations and marks was very helpful. I know there are a lot of ""fake"" pieces on the market and this book is proving to be an invaluable guide for me. The history was very interesting also. Thank you Ms. Gaston! A really beautiful book and very informative."
5,relevance to my search?,"I am searching the net for info. on a piece of porcelain I have. I'd like to acquire your book if you can tell me if it is relevant to my piece. The mark is described as follows: - five pointed star at top - beneath this two capital letters. ""R"" and ""S"" - These letters are flanked by boughs with leaves on them. - The ""R"" and ""S"" are seperated by what looks like a shrub. - Beneath this assemblage is the word ""GERMANY."" Thank-you for your time and consideration given my request for information."
1,beware--another bargain basement dud,"What a disappointment. I bought this thinking it would use the superb prints that were available on laser disc from CBS Fox a few years ago. But these look and sound like ancient TV prints that might pass muster at 3 am--the sound might not pass even then. Terror By Night is the worst; and the company has the nerve to begin with a card boasting of its committment to film restoration. Nothing is restored here, to say the least. The additions are neat, if you like old radio shows, but this box is too expensive to warrant the kind of bargain basement garbage put out by companies like Medacy. The truth is, because DVDs are so much cheaper to manufacture than Lasers, a lot more sleazes are getting involved in it. Basil and Nigel deserve much better."
1,Highly Disapointing,"I almost died waiting for this. I have all the rathbone holmes videos on VHS and the quality of the VHS is substantially better. I am not sure how these people managed to do it, but the sound is next to impossible to understand on dressed to kill and the radio plays are the worst quality I have heard. I suggest you buy the VHS editions and purchase the simon & shuster releases of the radio plays on cassette (available at amazon also). Dont waste your money on this one."
2,Don't buy it for the films,"The other reviews already point out the reasons not to buy this set. The ONLY reason to own it is for the 15 hours of radio shows starring Rathbone & Bruce. There are plenty of radio shows available with others playing Holmes & Watson, but the Rathbone/Bruce shows are hard to find. Is it worth over $... for these shows? Only for the die hard fan."

5,"Others will come and go, but there will always be Basil","Here is a gift to those of you who will see the ""Woman In Green"" about the finger murders....In the climatic scene when Henry Daniell as Moriarity dictates a suicide note and tells Holmes to ""sign your name"", Basil Rathbone signs his real name, including crossing the ""T"" in his last name.This collection is priceless for the radio shows alone....I have all these movies on tape and some on laser disc, but I jumped at the chance to get this boxed set...my question: when will we get the other 8 films on DVD."
1,"""Terror by Night"" Cut to Shreds","I've watched only ""Terror by Night"" of this set so far, and an unfortunate first choice it was. A massive cut near the beginning deprives viewers of a key plot mis-direction and great bumbling scenes by Nigel Bruce as Dr. Watson. The box copy indicates that these DVD versions were restored from rare and badly damaged prints. Rubbish! The San Jose, CA PBS station (KTEH) aired the full-length version recently--and in quality not much worse than the DVD. I'd call this set ""An Aggravating Evening with Sherlock Holmes."""
2,NOT GREAT QUALITY,Be aware that the quality of the films is not the greatest. Universal put out superior Laser Discs and videos of these Sherlock Holmes films. The extra material is good to have but I think most people are buying this set for the films themselves. There are better prints of these films out there.
2,A very disappointing DVD Set,"I have seen much better Sherlock Holmes movies on TV. The audio is garbled on some of the discs making it hard to listen to. The audio radio programs are exceptional however. Very good. But I bought this set for the movies, not for the audio programs. I hope that some of the other Sherlock Holmes movies that will be coming out from other Companies are better than this one. I just saw ""Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars"" and was very pleased, both with the picture and sound, which is exceptional for a Movie made over 60 years ago. The Company that put together these Movies should be ashamed of themselves for putting out these Movies and charging these prices for them."
1,Hardly worth 1 star,The quality of this DVD collection is extremely poor. Films are missing segments. The sound is very poor and occasionally out of synchronization with the video. VHS of individual films is by far a better choice.
5,Best Book Ever!,"My 9 year old daughter found this book in her school library and brought it home to read. She would not put it down. We're on Amazon right now writing this review becasue we are buying our own copy.In my daughter's words: The story was action packed. There was always so much going on and something to look forward to. It made you want to read ""just one more page"". The story goes back and forth between Rick and Cracker which makes it interesting. This is a great book for anyone! I can't wait to have my own copy and read it again!"
2,"Great Historical Novel, but Questionable content for Youth!!","Kadahota, you should be ashamed of yourself!!!! How do you sleep at night knowing you are influencing young boys (your book is recommended for 10 and up) to look at girls in a sensual manner, curse, be crude, and glamorize smoking! Thankfully, my son came to me so I can sharpie out all of the inappropriate parts. Is there any innocence left with our children anymore? Surely, you could have gotten your point across without it!Parents, if you are comfortable with these topics, then it is a great historical story. It is great for boys who have an interest in the army and gives a great description of the Vietnam War. At least you have the foreknowledge that I wish I had before giving it to my son."
2,Cracker,"BEWARE: This book is an amazing story, but, be warned it is full of curse words and talks of smoking in positive light etc... I am glad I have a child that came to me upon reading the first bad word. I then blacked out the word and all the ones in the rest of the book. That done ...it is a great book. It is too bad the author felt that she should put this in what otherwise would have been a good story. I don't think it is too much to expect a children's book to be free this."
3,Cracker,"This is book for children. I should have known this because Kadohata has written several children's books (Newberry Award on some of them) and the story line is appropriate for children, not deep enough for adults. The happy ending, although I'm not sure it could have happened that way considering the rules that the military enforced at that time (Vietnam War), could only be appropriate for children.The rules have changed since this book was written, though, and I wonder if the change of rules would have made for any kind of story compelling enough to write a book about."
4,Excellent book but for older children,"Excellent young adult book for a look at the Vietnam War told in simple terms easy enough for adolescents to understand. Cracker is the fictional story of a dog trained to sniff out bombs and the presence of the enemy, and this book takes us through her training and some combat missions. Because of its subject matter it's probably more suited to older children but it shields them from gory details without diminishing the evils of war, and also tells in a simple way of the conflict the soldiers feel about the pride of fighting for their country versus the dismay about the death around them. It also details the true and unhappy end suffered by most of the dogs that actually served in the Vietnam War."
5,Best Book Ever!!!,"Cracker! The best dog in vietnam, was one of Kadohata's finest pieces ever! She showed the point of view of Rick Hanski who is just a seventeen year old wanting to prove to everyone he is cut out for war, and also the point of view of Cracker, Rick's dog, who has just been sent to be trained as a boom sniffing dog in the Vietnam war. At first the two don't get along but later on they have to work together to be the best team in Vietnam. This book is great for anyone over 13. Kadohata really makes the reader feel as if they are really in the true action and lives of the main characters. I've read this book soooooo many times and i can never get sick it:)"
3,Not as pictured,"I am new at using kelp in my garden. The item was pictured as being in a box with information on the box on how to use it. When I got the item is was in a big clear bag with a label simply saying kelp meal. I don't even know if what was in the bag is really kelp meal or not. There was no other information provided with the bag. If I knew what I was doing that might have been fine but I bought the item because it appeared to be in a box with directions like 1cup per 2 cube feet or something like that. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000COBZBM/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleI am not trying to hurt the seller but I needed more. I am not posting the review for others to see. However, the seller needs to provide useful information when sending a product if it is not in the packaging pictured."
2,Radio airplays does not always match the CD version,"Although Chris Tomlin's CD is a good listen, I bought it for one song: ""Everlasting God"". However, I was disappointed to find that the version that appears on this CD is not the more edgy rock version that is played on my local Christian radio station. It should have at least been added as an extra. This version is like Chris Tomlin meets the Ray Conniff Singers. What a disappointment! You would think they would not be so tricky with business when it comes to Christian music. Guess they are all the same! The low rating is not for Chris' work but for the record company."
5,Great music,A CD I have had for a while now and still play it often. Highly recommend - the words are great!
5,Beautiful,One of the best CD's I've purchased in a long time. I love listening to it...it's very inspiring and calming.
5,Great Music for your Spirit!,"After a year of attending contemporary Christian services at a local church, I really started enjoying the music. Most of the songs I heard were on this CD, as well as Chris Tomlin's ""Arriving"" CD. It's definately music for the soul. When I listen, I seem to feel a little better about life! Chris Tomlin's music is encouraging and uplifting, and I highly recommend adding a few of his CD's to your collection!"
3,"I really wanted this album to be as good as Arriving, but:","It isn`t. Yes there are some good songs here, but many are of the kind you really don`t listen to, you just hear them. And Chris` CCM sound is starting to get to clouded and naked without soul. And when the quality of the sound on the recording if far below average I find this CD rather poor. I regret buying it. Instead of getting this one I will encourage you to instead get Brenton Brown's latest. 10 times as good."
3,ok but hardly any nudity,"not all that different than tv show,just a lot of cusswords,i guess that is mostly the uncensored part,just not enough nudity for me really only 2 scenes of nudity,no caption which you need to follow all the back and forth talking between all parties involved including Joey and Tommy,but it did show alot of the scenes i had forgot about."
4,touching,The book is really well written & takes you into the lives of these girls who were victimized in their homes & now by the system
4,Can You Solve It First?,My five year-old son just finished reading this entire book with almost no help in one sitting - he loved finding the clues along the way to solving the mystery. This whole series of books is great for boys and girls just beginning their reading journey.
4,Amazing band,This is one of the famous band of this new wave of new age. Great compilation with tracks from every previous albums. Even two new tracks from the forthcoming album and one track from their first demo.
4,Try This Title First-Especially Ryan Farish fans!,"I am a big Ryan Farish fan who was looking for something a little slower with less of a ""trance"" or ""dance"" feel that is common with his work.Amethystium has the same overall feel with alot of the same style,but they are a little more quiet""New Age"".Amethystium is similar to Deep Forest,but they have much more coherent melodies instead of feeling like a ""mystical"" and meandering Lord of the Rings sountrack style.Amethystium uses alot of the same bright electronic programming and ethereal background vocals as Enigma and Ryan Farish.This is actually a collection of their best,so sample these tracks first!"
5,Beautiful Collection,"This cd is a beautiful collection of the most beautiful and deep new age/darkwave/ambient songs in the world(The songs of Amethystium). All of the songs are remastered. Though I'd also want ""Berceuse"", ""Withdrawal"", ""Paean"" and ""ilona"" in this collection, still this cd is definitely worth buying."
2,This version is not the complete CD,"Although the CD is good, be aware that the CD is NOT the entire set offered by Musicspace. There are actually 2CDs and the product offered is only the first CD. I was disappointed to find this out when I received the shipment."
1,Gives very general info ... not worth the money!,"This book gave the most basic and general information about opening a child care service. It claims to cover both centers and family day care, but really only discusses centers in any depth. This is NOT the book for anyone looking to open a family day care. It covers information that people should already know anyway (except that it does write about how many mops and trash cans centers should have). Please don't waste your money on this one. Steelsmith's book is MUCH better - you will get a lot more out of that one!"
5,Where it started,"Blues from the beginning of electrification with an elemental purity. Perhaps not the greatest blues album of all times (did I hear someone mention Muddy Waters?), but a seminal collection of excellent tracks, non-the-less. I was lucky enough to jam several times with Lazy Bill Lucas after he left Chicago for Minneapolis in the early 60s and always loved his piano playing. Hearing him again was an unbelievable treat for me, all the rest was gravy (quite tasty too)."
2,Warmed over leftovers,"To his discredit, Dr. Unwin virtually brags in the introductory chapter that nearly all of the questions and arguments that have mystified pterosaurs since their discovery have been answered in recent years, but when it comes time to reveal those answers, Unwin typically sidesteps. Origins? Still not sure. Family tree? With over a hundred genera to choose from, and many recently discovered, Unwin falls back on a favorite few and places them on an antique tree, not a modern cladogram. While Unwin's writing style is refreshing and easy to read (every chapter opens with short fiction), and his photos are first rate, the line work is rarely original and never detailed. Almost nothing is shown from the neck down. Only skulls are presented. Most, if not all, of the drawings are recognizable from other sources. So, a disappointed reader here."
2,Too Dumbed-Down,"I could only read this book for so long before ""gasping for air""; it was way too dumbed-down for my taste, even as a non(but aspiring)-scientist. It is really a children's book. My bad. The illustrations are striking, though."
3,they're ok,"i got two bottles of yellow .12 bb's with 2000 in each bottle. they arent to strong, because when i shoot them at my sticky target, they stick obvioulsy, but if i hit the BB with another BB it shatters. they shoot pretty good to, i can be pretty accurate with them from about 10-13 feet away from my target, but after that im about half an inch off. and since they arent exactly to accurate id reccomend them for an automatic gun, cuz they are cheap and sorta strong."
2,Only 1 bottle,Only 1 bottle came with the order. Picture is misleading. BB's do have small seams from the manufacturing process.
4,they rock,these bb's travel farther from my shotgun than i ever thought they would. they r very fast and withstand colision. these bb's r better than their priced by far. buy these bb's for sure.
4,Good BB's,"These are very good bb's. I used the ones that came with my gun and then these, and these were much better. These are probably the best affordable bb's out there, so don't pay a lot of money! Get these bb's!"
4,Spence's Roots,"Gerry Spence's books have all been favorites of mine and I always enjoy his commentary and personna. This bio is written in his usual compelling style and I loved hearing about his childhood, family and the experiences that helped mold him into the remarkable man he became. Definitely worth the time invested to read this book and I recommend all of his books to anyone interested in the complexities of the legal system in this country."
5,This century'sTom Paine,"Next to ""The Paper Chase"",I found Gerry Spence's autobiography to be extremely inspirational, and yet, this time he offered wisdom for the rest of us who do not take up the law. One reviewer missed the point about ""country lawyer""(the common man), trying to weaken Spence's building diatribe against corporate America. His vivid, meticulous storytelling ranges as wide as the landscape of his upbringing, where Horatio Alger meets Franklin and finishes with Thomas Paine. In other words, he offers hope for the little guy, the citizen, if men of his cloth would abandon their ways and the rest of us would stop acting like lemmings. This captivating, truth-telling journey to adulthood, runs from the depression to the consumptive new millenium. His many Lincolnian lessons throughout make it a deservedly classic manual for the under-taught. Spence proves Darwin wrong. It's not the fittest, the prepared truth-seekers."
3,it would be wise to stick to the little guy and not oneself,"Gerry spence is a slow talking and reserved attorney turned celebrity. Too bad he does not focus his talents on death row inmates in need of adequate defense. Mr. Spence, it is time to save the lives the nation is so horrifyingly attemting (and succeeding I might add)to snuff out. In a land where murder turned law is a sign of the times, someone with vision needs to be visible. You should welcome a clean concious as much as you welcome media attention. I don't care about O.J. Simpson, but I do care about those tortured in awaiting shameless public execution. The mob is on the rise, Mr. Spence, the innocent are the damned. One cannot know the true love of a woman without knowing true love for ones fellow man. Don't retire yet, Mr. Spence. Dazzle the law with your brilliance at the helm of this corrupt yet salvageable system. Save lives."
5,"A personal, frank & moving story.","I enjoy biographies and dislike most lawyers. This book caught my eye and since I had seen Mr. Spence on TV many times I checked it out of the library. I had been somewhat put off by his fringed jacket-Wyoming-cowboy persona and was prepared to dislike this book; now I can't wait to read the rest of his oeuvre. Mr. Spence shares the most intimate details of his life,including the reasons for his choice of wardrobe. His story is a fascinating one and it is told with both charm and passion. I enjoyed his descriptions of his early years hunting and working on his family's farms, evoking a vanishing America, or at least one that few of us will ever know or know anything about. He writes of the most important incident of his life, his mother's suicide, and how he finally broke the crippling bonds of guilt that tortured him for years, without self pity and with great literary skill. I salute him for sharing his story with us in such a moving and thoughtful way"
3,What's behind the curtain?,"Although I found this book to be interesting, I still feel it lacked something. Spence tells us of his growing up, his reason for becoming a lawyer, and the trials and tribulations in life. All well and good, but what isn't he telling us? If you over look the fact that one man cannot be this great (at least I don't think so)then the book will give you some insight into his world. The review of his cases are fasinating, and there is no argue from me that he is a fantastic Attorney. Overall an enjoyable book."
3,The title doesn't lie,"As Spence promises on the cover, this book is about himself.You'll learn how Spence's mother's selfish suicide and religious overbearing nature have plagued him. Her death was a life-long sentence without a trial. It drove him to obsess over the innocence and justifiable mistakes of others."
5,Sooooo Soft,"I have no great fondness for stuffed animals. I think there are way too many in the world. But this sheep is so adorable that once you see and touch it, you really want to have it around. It's just good for what ails you! I highly recommend it to anyone, of whatever age."
1,Just how many steps have I taken???,"This product counts steps when you bend over or move in your seat. I wore it for a couple of days, but now it sits in my desk drawer. I was not satisfied with it. It was easy to set up/program, but the overall accuracy was poor."
2,cheap and didn't work,"the item didn't work when we got it and rather than replace the item, they issued a refund without offering another item...thought that was odd"
4,A well chosen selection of philosophical readings,"I began reading this book as a textbook when in one of Professor Norton's classes at the University of Delaware, and have repeatedly revisitied it and loaned it over the years. I found it to be a fantastic introduction to the styles of some of the most renowned philosophers. It's a good blend of ""light"" philosophical reading and diverse points of view on the types of love."
2,It does not work,"Although Peter Cottontail is a very nice character, the young reader has to pull a string -- so the rabbit Peter will be hidden from sight. The mechanism do not work if you are intending to give this book to a baby or a toddler, specially because there are signs during the text, indicating if the child is supposed to pull down on the string or release it. Too complicated for the youngers, I think."
5,EXCELLENT DVD!,"My 25 month old surprised me the other day, we were playing with his match box cars and he just started counting them 1-10. WOW, I was so amazed I grabed him, gave him a bug hug and said great job. He's been counting everything since then! This is an awsome DVD, interesting, fun AND educational."
5,Great introduction to numbers!,I ordered this DVD from reading some of the reviews on Amazon and thought I would give it a try. It was definately worth it as my 2 1/2 year old daughter loves it! The Winnie The Pooh characters make learning numbers fun. They also sing some catchy songs that she loves. It is nice to know she can watch her favorite characters and learn something too. I do not think you can go wrong with this one!
2,I don't know,"I haven't received it yet and when I asked about it I did not get a response. Hum, where is the customer service???"
4,Good if you play it in French,"I got this for my 18 month old daughter to learn to count. However, I think there is not enough counting and a lot more 'just story' going on to be a really good counting video. I also don't like how Roo keeps making mistakes, how's that supposed to help a kid learn to count?! I cringe whenever those parts come on (he mixes up the numbers, and he stops at 6 or something and forgets, etc). I decided to play it in French, as my daughter has a much better counting dvd in English, and now she has started counting in French out of the blue! So, it's not going to mess up her English counting, and she's learning French! I'd say that's the best use for this dvd."
5,100% Satisfied,"Received in perfect condition well before the delivery time estimate.No problems with the CD, fully functional.100% Satisfied.Daughter watches over and over and is never bored."
4,entianing for my three year old,"I bought this for my son, and he has enjoyed it. I like the fact that it's not more than a half hour. Any longer and my son wouldn't watch it. He likes to watch this while I make dinner, so it makes an entertaing yet educational, so I don't feel as guilty ""putting him in front of the dreaded television."""
3,Adequate Replacement,"I was pleased to find this replacement part for an older power washer that I had inherited from my home's previous owner. The price was right and shipping was quick. Bolting the part on was very easy- the only warning I have is to watch out for the pull string on the new part. On the second or third test pull, the string pulled out of the handle. After dissembly to retrieve the string from inside the unit, I was able to double-knot it to prevent another occurrence. On the second test, the string pulled out from the other end, inside the unit! When you install this part, make sure to check both ends before you bolt everything on."
1,Does not even deserve a star,"The quality of this product is extremely poor, and should not deserve even one star. I installed it and thought it should be fine. When I pulled the string as usual, it was broken right before the knot at the end. Worst of all, the spring was broken at the same time. A broken spring makes this product totally useless. This is the worst shopping experience that I have with Amazon. Save yourself some money and time by going for genuine Honda parts."
1,Bad quality,This item is made so cheap it broke the first day. The handle came off first. Then it would not recoil. This item is made poorly.
1,Junk,"This item is a total piece of crap. It last for 6 pulls. All plastic, total ripoff. would not buy this item at any price."
1,Don't buy this product!,"First pull--rope came off the handle. Fished out the cord, retied. Third pull, the rope came off the other end. This is a cheap plastic imitation of the original with poor assembly. Don't waste your money and time buying this one."
1,Not worth the $$ you pay.,Item fit just fine. One second or third pull the string pulled through the handle. Had to rewind and retie. String does not want to full rewind into the unit. Very cheap.
1,Not good experience,"At the first try after installing it, the cord came off the handle. After I reinstalled it, then it was the other side of the cord that came out. I put it back on and now it does not work either as I imagine that i spoolled it back incorrectly. After a few tries, i gave up and ordered the OEM Honda recoil starter. I dont recommend this product"
1,Don't waste your time,"This part is totally worthless. I wish I would have seen the reviews before placing this order. The handle came off on the first pull. On the second pull the engine started but the rope would not retract. The engine flywheel grabbed it and now the cord and recoil mechanism are FUBAR. I should have guessed this would happen based on the flimsiness of it. Stens products are toys, not useable parts. I have not dealt with Terry's on this because it would cost at least $12 to send back to them and it was only $25 total. Very disappointing."
4,Good unit,Part installs and operates well and is easy to replace.Little pricey for a cheap plastic thing.
4,This is a Great book!!,"This book goes through the lives of professional firefighters, however I am a volunteer firefighter and can still relate to the stories."
2,Just Could Not Get Into This Book,"I'm not saying this book is bad, but I just could not get into this book. I thought I'd really enjoy it, but it's all one and two page anecdotes. A lot of them are very repetitive of the other ones. I think if they stuck to only a dozen or so in depth, it would have been more interesting and enjoyable, at least for me that is. But this is just my opinion, the other reviewers all seemed to enjoy it. If you think this book may appeal to you, go ahead and try it. Don't go by my opinion, after all it is only my humble opinion."
4,"Excellent Stan Montieth, Radio Liberty show on the UN's sinister Population control program!","Tom Valentine and Stan Montieth, onRadio Free America and Radio Libertyshows, respectively have covered thesesubjuects better than anyone. You canalso get these at: richunderscoresalzer-atyahoodotcom!"
3,No 12mm socket,"I've had good luck with IR and this set seems as well made as the rest of their product line. The only thing I fault it on, is it does not have a 12mm socket! My bad, I didn't read the description and made an assumption. A 12mm is pretty standard on most cars, so take note. The case is large relative to the sockets, takes up a lot of space."
1,Cheap,"Not made in USA. Bought as a present with the presumption of made in USA, Ingersoll Rand, how disappointing for $3.00s a socket."
4,My Place a story of discovery,"Sally Morgan, a young woman growing up in Perth, Western Austraila in the 50's is intreaged by her heritage. Her mother had always been shy of it and told Sally to say to her friends that she was Indian when she was asked about her origins. It was only when she was in her late teens that she discovers that she is Aboriginal. The book is separated into 4 sections; Sally's Autobiography and the biographies of her mother; her grandmother and her grandmothers brother. Facinating reading"
1,my place on the shelf,"I have been forced to study this book for my HSC(final exams at high school)and have found the book to be poorly written and rather bland next to other books we could have studied. The story, while being a realistic view of what has happened in Australian history, would not have been published as widely with out the recent reconciliation issues in Australia."
3,"Somewhat disappointing, but love Betty White!","I found this film to be a bit of a disappointment. I like the male lead and the bits with Betty White, but I think the character of the female lead could have definitely been tweaked ""a bit."""
2,betty white has asmall role,ok why the big picture of betty whitethey want us to have the indication that she has abig role in this moviethats not the case
3,Weakest of the series,"While it is interesting to have a book an earlier look at Cains life, the lack of a good plot and repetitive fight scenes make this the weakest of the series.The book is by no means bad, and for any fan of the series I recommend reading it. However, the plot is literally Cain just fighting Orks to get back to his unit. Not only that the ending is pretty weak in my opinion. There is also a couple unanswered questions.It gives you a good perspective on just how tough the orcs can be, and some of the fights are pretty impressive, but I would certainly recommend any of the other 3 over this."
4,Worth It.,"I actually read Duty Calls before this one, and I'd thought I had ruined this book for myself, but the story more than stands on its own, and thus far I'd have to say, it's my favorite of the series. I don't want to give anything away, but it was just the kind of story I think any fan of the ""overwhelmed but steadfast fighters"" might like, the only real problem being that in the end it felt like it was over too soon, and some things, a little too predictable."
4,Worth it!,Definite entertainment...flawed only by a well used cliche strategem very familiar to miltary Sci-Fi fans. You will see it a mile away once the scenario surfaces....Don't want to ruin it for anyone else ..and besides its still a darn good story. Cain fans will be pleased.As usual the commentary adds to the fun.
5,Classic Betty Boop,I got this DVD for my kids because they didn't know who Betty Boop was!! They love it!
4,Excellent shower mat,"This item on sale at $7.99, less more on Amazon's 4 for 3 sale, is definitely worth it. Aside from the price, this is a well made mat and does not slide in the shower. If you are needing this item, you can't go wrong for a net price of $6. September 26, 2007 update: My husband takes a shower daily, and keeping up with the mildew on this mat was driving me crazy. In desperation, I cleaned it thoroughly and have begun putting it in the washing machine with my other laundry every week. This will keep the mildew at bay. Just don't put it in the dryer!"
2,"Looks nice, but slides around...","I replaced a different type of shower mat that had seen better days, with this one. It's crisp and clean looking, but the only hole has to be centered over the shower drain hole, and it doesn't adhere to the shower floor very well. So, it slips, the water doesn't drain well. I wouldn't buy it again."
4,Good mat,"I just purchased 2 of these. They are very nice mats, although a little too small for one of my large showers. Check the size before ordering."
2,Be Careful,AquaTouch Stall Mat tends to slip while standing on it. Be careful not to make quick moves when in use.
1,big mistake,"Hi I just bought this shaving cream, thinking it would smell good. I was so wrong it smells so bad I am urging you not to waste your money, you will regret it. I can't really tell you what it smells like but it's bad. The shaving cream itself works just fine but the odor is just awful, save your money and don't buy it"
1,Presentation incorrect.,"I have already bought 4 in the same season, because the description said to be subtitled in Spanish and French and is not true. I have all seasons subtitled (unless this). I recently purchased the season 8 and is also subtitled. I hope that if this can not be correct, as well forward to inform consumers."
2,Closed Captions,For some unknown reason they stopped including english closed captions starting with the 5th season.
2,Spanish Subtitles,Does any body know why they didn't include spanish subtitles?? Where can I get the Complete Seventh Season with spanish subtitles???
1,Bad performance,No english subtitles. No Spanish subtitles. No Spanish Audio.Nothing good for foreign people.I had to return it
5,ER Season 7,Love it. Still hate that Mark gets sick :( But love the show. Can't wait to get season 8
4,I heart ER,The season is great as usual for seasons of ER. The box was a little dinged-up but not bad and all of the dvds are in good condition. So overall I am a very satisfied customer!!
3,Scratched but plays fine,All dvd's are in mint condition except for the first one. I havent watched all of it yet but seems to play fine so far.
4,"Great season, if tough for the characters","Season 7 certainly doesn't let up on the drama. Sometimes it feels like it's almost too much, but you'll find yourself eager to see each new episode to find out what happens next. Really there's never been a Medical Drama like ER, and this season still has the majority of the original cast. It's well worth the price, and a great follow up to Season 6.(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review. However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone. Further, the reviewer independently selected this product to review and has no affiliation with the product maker/distributor, Amazon or the review requester.)"
5,"well-written, character-driven season","The most memorable episodes of this season are structured around Dr. Kovacs. When he responds to a terrible accident, we learn about the tragedy he lived through in Croatia. It's one of the best explanations of the power of grief and impact of trauma I have ever seen. Incredibly well-acted and well-written story line-- completely convincing and moving.Abby and Carter support each other in seeking recovery, and Sally Fields dazzles in her Emmy award-winning role as Abby's mom in ""The Visit"". Greene and Cordray's relationship is satisfying, too.Overall, a very strong season!"
4,"'To most of my clients, bifocal glasses are asthma.' ..","With these words, we are drawn into the world of Rita, make-up artist to the stars.The Dolly series are Dorothy Dunnett's contemporary mysteries: a world away from the intrigues of Niccolo (fifteenth century) and Lymond (sixteenth century). Or are they?Dorothy Dunnett brings the same energetic, descriptive writing to the Dolly series as is evident in her historical novels. The action is fast, the hero is enigmatic and intelligent. The setting is exotic, and the characters? Judge for yourself.Recommended as both great fun and as an example of Dorothy Dunnett's versatility. There are seven novels in this series.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"
2,the wow effect,"The book is an attempt to make sense of many facts in regards to the possibilities of tech. The result is a long magazine article which gets exhausting because each page has the most and best, etc... There are other books that have the same information but are better written."
4,An important aspect of the donor egg cycle was not discussed,"A donor egg cycle may include the medication, Lupron. Weeks of Lupron therapy puts one in a different hormonal state in which one is barely able to function. Nurses call this induced hormonal state, ""going under,"" which includes hot flashes and debilitating headaches. Not addressed in the book are the physical symptoms that occur with supression of one's natural hormones and treatment, if any, of the physical symptoms. Although generally informative, I wonder what other critical information may have been left out."
5,A must for every family!,I picked up a copy of this book from www.lifetimeguides.com and have not put it down. This is exactly what my husband and I need to get our life in order. I recommend this guide to everyone - especially if you have young kids. It is informative and easy to use and will help you start doing the things that you have always known that you should do to keep you and your family safe.
3,Ok but not great,"The few color pictures are pointless. There is some good information, but the section on revitalizing your lawn is too small. I was looking for a general reference, but they say to aerate but never mention when you should do this (I have read this in other books) and they don't mention other techniques that I have read other places. This book would be pretty good for someone starting from scratch. If you just want to improve your lawn, buy another book."
4,Good Book but not as advertised,"Overall, great book. Does not go too in depth, but gives you enough information to know what you are talking about when time comes to head to the hardware store.Only disappointment is that its advertised with a Full Color Section. Printer must of only had black ink at time of printing as my copy had absolutely no color section whatsoever. My copy has really nice B&W; photos. Would have been nice to see those in color. Did not complain or send back as my time is worth more than the expense of returning the book."
5,Great!,The book arrived at the designated time and was in great condition. It's helpful because I am clueless about lawn care. I would buy from this seller again.
2,Too Basic!,"This book is really basic. I found that ""How to Make Big Money Mowing Small Lawns"" as a better resource. It had easy to understand charts. Simplistic pricing method. Simple to understand and extremely helpful/useful in earning extra income. This book offers unique and insightful ideas to help get you off the ground. It gives real life experience of the author will enable them to have insight into business that is fundamental to becoming entrepreneurial. An updated version is available at librarydepot.com"
5,Fantastic olives,"These olives are crispy, delicious, wonderful quality.They are a little too salty but if you put them in a glass jar with water for couple days,they would be perfect."
2,"Not very challenging, despite the hype","Many reviewers described Yoga With Ateeka as a challenging workout for intermediates. I've been doing yoga consistently for 2 yrs (meaning, I'm pretty good, but no expert), and I found this tape extremely easy and kind of boring. The poses are all very basic (although she does about hold them for longer than expected) and the pace is tedious. If you're an intermediate or beyond, this is a perfect workout for when you're really tired or not in the mood to sweat. Otherwise, give it a miss."
2,Just OK,"I was looking for a Power Yoga tape, and I did not think this tape had enough of the power moves in it. I found myself bored.It is a great way to relax, but not enough if you are looking for a power yoga workout."
4,Beautiful but not so enjoyable,"The music is real fine. Sung in the best possible ways, nice songs, good accompaniment. But: the recording is refused in about half of the CD-players in my posession... This is not to be enjoyed, when putting the cd in a machine forgetting it gets stuck.. A real pity this is. I would still love to have a copy which plays normally...!"
1,Buyer Beware,"This CD cannot be played on a PC or Mac. If you like to listen to music you have paid for, on the device you choose, steer clear of this intentionally corrupted CD.The music is very good but I want to listen to it on my chosen device - not what the record company says I must use."
2,Brilliant Writer sometimes Writes Brilliantly,"The essay with the same name as the title of this book is excellent, but I found the rest of them disappointing."
1,Don't fit on my 2005 Suz Aerio,"Amazon website asked a questions of info about my car before I bought, when I tried to install this part, the inner end part of it that connects to the transmission is slightly larger in diameter, so it didn't fit.I took the part off of the old axle and transfer it to this DSS5905N and that's the way i put it to service."
5,Great stuff,My hedgehog loves this food! I tried to feed him another brand and he refused it so this is all we use.
3,"Outdated, Yet Still Useful","This book is outdated for a student of the digital age, but it still holds some relevent information that comes in handy for some classes.The copy I got was in great condition. (And yes, it came with a 3.5"" Disk that still appeared to be in great shape. Haha! :) )"
4,funky and new,"So many dance/house CDs overlap after a while. This one is all new, some vocals but not too much. Some of the tracks hint at early 80s computer music, but he doesn't overdo it."
4,forced into a good read,"This book is good for any college student (or anyone else) who is interested in the modernist period. I read a large portion of the book for a class, and the examples of Virginia Woolf, Rebecca West, and T. S. Eliot as modernist authors were useful in understanding the different concepts found in the modernist time period. The avant-garde, realism and stream of consciousness were particularly well defined; prior to studying this book I was not familiar with these concepts. This book is difficult in the way it is written--when discussing stories the reader may not be familiar with, a lot of the analysis is hard to follow--but over time a reader can get used to the style. I really appreciated the information I obtained from this book, and I would recommend it to others."
5,"Very interesting, good product","I am not a drummer but admire Bill Bruford's work immensely. I bought this for someone I know, but before giving it up, I read through all of the commentary that precedes each transcription. It is obvious from reading this book (if you couldn't already tell from his music) that Bill Bruford is an intelligent, thoughful musician."
4,Great book for interfaith situations,"I use this book a lot for reflections, interfaith prayers, spiritual thoughts, etc. This would highly benefit anyone working as a chaplain or minister in a nonsectarian setting. Or if you just like to rattle the cages in an egocentric environment. ""I can't believe you used ""Goddess"" in a prayer in a Catholic hospital!"" Yes, I did. And people loved it."
4,Praying out loud,"The book was helpful but not what I expected. The focus is entirely on interfaith prayers and the examples, while uplifting, were a little on the esoteric side for my purposes."
5,Incredible Editing,"Even if I watched this with no sound I would be mesmerized. Some of the best footage and exquisite editing I've seen. A must see for anyone in film, or, anyone who wants to enjoy a good flick."
2,This clock could use some improvement,"Westclox kept the appearance of this alarm clock in the vintage style; however, I found the manufacturing and functionality to be poor. I actually own some of the older Westclox keywound alarms that are still keeping time, looking great, and running 50 years later. Here are some of the problems: 1) The entire clock was encased in molded plastic when it arrived. When I attempted to cut the plastic away from the face of the clock without injuring myself, the plastic face became scratched 2) The clock runs fast, but the slot to adust the timing is too small to fit a coin, key, or screwdriver in order to adjust it 3) If it is 10:58 p.m., and you want to set the alarm for anywhere in the 10 a.m. range, you have to wait until after 11 p.m. in order to turn the alarm on (otherwise it will just ring continuously until you shut it off)"
2,"Not as pictured, and scuffed-up case : Disappointed.","Disappointed. Reasons:(1) Not as pictured. Please see photo of the item I actually received, which I added to this item (should be at the top of this item page, in additional item photos). As you can see from the photo, a. it doesn't have the gold trim, b. the plastic hinges are much more prominent at the top on the one that ships, and c. it just is more ""plastic-y"" looking than the one originally pictured.(2) It arrived in a factory-sealed plastic Westclox package, but as you can see from the additional photo I added, the case was pre-scuffed along the top edge and the lower lip, and also on the faces.Operation: Wound it ""pretty tight"" 24 hours ago, not running now. Haven't investigated further.As an aside, like the reviewer below me commented, I was sent this small clock in a large cardboard box with no pading whatsoever. It just bounced around in the box all the way here. Maybe explains the scuffs..."
5,a very good book.....,"a good book for those that like both fanatsy and mystery. others in the series are just as good, if not better."
2,Bureaucratic Boredom,"You certainly can't say that the title is midleading; it is all, too accurate. You'll learn very little about deception operations in WW II but you'll damn sure know where all these guys had lunch! While some of this is interesting, I suspect you'd find much the same type of thing about any bureaucracy. And, as you might expect, it's highly overwrought (and over-written) with three-letter abbreviations and obscure code words (even when they are superflouous)Having plowed through this, I know little more about Allied deception operations in WW II than I did when I started (But I do know the various clubs that some of these folks hung out in.), which is what the title of the book implies it will be about -- Deception Operations.Unless you like reading about the lives of dull people, I might suggest you pass this one by."
3,"Hypnosis, intuition and ESP","This is interesting book that will explain what the hypnosis is. It is sort of historical overview on how it came to be used by so many people today. From being treated as hocus-pocus science to being recognized as a mean of supplementing regular medical treatements to enhancing our innate human ability such as intuition, awareness and yes - ESP. It was interesting to read the case studies and biographies of the first practitioners of this healing method. Do not expect to see any scripts that you can use. I wish book addresed more self hypnosis. In most cases, we read about trance induced to the subjects by their therapists."
4,"Really good for what they are...not homemade, but...","I am a gourmet cook. I don't have high expectations for store bought food, namely cookies. These were surprisingly good. The kids love them and although I purchased them for gift baskets, they seem to be disappearing at a good clip. Overall, good value for the money. Better than Chips Ahoy (R) but not homemade."
3,Could be better,"As a lifelong fan of the Everly Brothers I enjoyed getting to know a little more about their personal lives and some of the history of their careers. But this book has some obvious flaws. Several quotes attributed to the brothers contain ""Britishisms"" that Americans don't use in their speech. This may seem like a small thing, but when someone is being quoted the quotes should be accurate. It makes me doubt the accuracy of everything else in the book. This, coupled with a general lack of depth left me a little dissatisfied."
4,"fast delivery, no surprises",The description of the condition of the book was dead on and got my satisfaction. A great purchase and a great book.
3,The Textbook Jesse James,Like most Americans I know the folklore surrounding Jesse James. I purchased this book to get a little better overview of the man himself. To be honest this is almost like a college textbook. There was very little narrative and some parts were... sorry to say... boring. I would not recoomend this to an average reader. To anyone who is a student of the Civil War and maybe someone interested in American crime this book will be somewhat interesting. Me..i'll stick to the folklore!
2,It's really not a bio,"I picked this book up, like everyone else, as I was curious about the man behind the legend. Well, I never really learned all that much about Jesse James. I certainly learned about Missouri, Kansas, the civil war, bushwackers and the like, but not a whole lot about James.It seemed well researched and Stiles writes in a readable style but it was not the book I thought it would be."
2,Nothern Perspective Ruins a potentially good book,"The author uses his position to judge James using 21st century morality.Example: Some Union soldiers nearly kill James' step-father by hanging him. Jessie, as a teenager witnesses this. The next year, when Jessie is now riding with the rebels they pay a visit to the man, no longer in the Union army, who ordered the near hanging of Jessie's step father and execute the man.The author goes out of his way to defend the former Union solider as a Non-combatant (any more) and that said killing was therefore unjustifiable.I'm sorry. Just because the Unionist was no longer in the military doesn't protect him from the form of ""street justice"" which even today exists on America's cities and in the country.I suspect this guy is just an academic who doesn't know how the real world operates."
3,"Starts well, bogs down","Really falls apart around the middle of the book, degenerating into a lot of minutiae...and Jesse himself is never fully characterized, as most of the book is about those around him (or just alive at the same time)."
5,"A thoughtful, much-need reinterpretation","Lets face it: the last definitive biography of Jesse James came out quite some time ago. This book was a much-needed reinterpretation of a man who was indeed romanticized as latter day Robin Hood. To say that Stiles is biased because he's from the North makes as much sense as saying that the only unbiased viewpoint possible is from a Southerner. As modern biographies tend to be more probing about character, psychology and motivation, and takes into account formative experiences, I think we're seeing a much more compelling picture of James as someone who experienced early brutality and who learned to give as good as he got. In this way, Stiles is as respectful and fairer to his subject than James fans with an emotional attachment give him credit for.A must-read for anyone who is interested in American History."
3,Silly Cheeseheads!,"Do you like to read about aliens? Do you like stinky cheese? Do you like silly books? Then here is book for you. This is about Funny Boy, a ""good alien"" who has been sent to Earth to save us from ""unspeakably disgusting aliens."" In two other books Funny Boy saved Earth from alien invaders by using his sense of humor and jokes. He alleviated the Airsick Alien from Andromeda, and then banished the Bubble Brained Barbers from the Big Bang. Now, the President of the United States has drafted Funny Boy to save us from conniving chitchatting Cheeses from the celestial planet of Chattanooga. It's already ""snowing"" white cheddar cheese on New Jersey! Funny Boy better think fast!"
3,"Great Story, Bad Electronic Copy","This review is for the Kindle version.This book and the second half, ""Robin"", comprise a wonderful romantic story, but this electronic copy is not well done. Words are misspelled, halves of sentences are missing. It's still worth reading, but be prepared for some frustration. Also, the second part (Robin) isn't available on the Kindle, but you can find it free elsewhere on the web."
5,Great Wrench,"I have a 2004 Intruder VL1500 LC and bought this for that bike. Motion Pro makes some nice stuff and this is no exception. The wrench is well made, fits the bike well, and I would say buy one."
1,Beware of product quality problems!,"I bought three of these in April 2007. Today, only two months later, one of the three is going bad. It's making noises that healthy hard drives don't make, and it has frozen my system when it has gone into this state. I'm desperately trying to keep it working long enough to move my data from it to another drive before I lose it all."
1,Find something else,"If you were hoping for RAID support on the 500GB model, think again, SimpleTech specifically removed this in their latest update for this model. Their support site states over and over again that sizes of 500 & 750 GB don't have RAID support, but their marketing at their homepage says it does. They admittedly, really it's in their support pages, state that security updates in Vista and OSx cause issues with getting full access to their device. They know about the issues and have done nothing in two years (that was their last firmware update) to even try to fix the issues. Bottom-line, find something else where the manufacturer even cares to keep up with the times."
3,"An ok Game, but don't spend your money on it.","First of all, even though I am only ten years old, I know a lot about computers. Army Men 2 is an ok game except for the fact that when you are driving a vehicle, you cannot shoot any weapons (with the exception of the tank, with a bazooka and the halfback, with a auto-rifle). Also,when driving, it is rarely easy to fit between two trees that you would be able to fit through in real life. Thank you for taking time to read this review, and have a great day!!"
3,failed after less than 2 months,"Worked fine for less than 2 months in a Nikon D300.Nikon started displaying CHA errors, which are compact flash read/write errors. I could force an error by doing a 6FPS burst of RAWs. It takes longer to fail with jpegs.Replaced the card as a test w/ sandisk ultra II, which works fine. Problem follows the card. The extreme IV won't format in Windows at all any longer -- windows utility actually locks up after saying ""format did not succeed""-type message.Sandisk has yet to issue an RMA, despite it being about a month into the process."
5,Very fast card. Worth the money.,I already had the Extreme III - 2GB. I wanted another one for my Canon XTi. I went ahead and got this Extreme IV. Have not been disappointed. Transfers from card to DEsktop is also very fast.
3,Cello Asesino,"solo para fans del terror asiatico,no es una gran produccion pero esta entretenida,es la clasica del fantasma que regresa del mas alla a saldar cuentas"
3,A specific type of scare,"Cello is your basic korean ghost story. However it offers a very specific type of scare for its audience. I personally found the film to be far more depressing than frightening. I've become rather accustome, like most audience members for horror these days, to jump scares and frightening images to classify something as horror. This movie has very few of either. The main scare of this film comes at the very end as a twist, and while scary in its own way, its not a generally frightening idea unless pondered for a while. It seems like the main fear that can be induced from this film is really more depressing than scary. A beautiful film with strong acting, this horror movie just doesnt feel like horror."
3,Interesting but not great,"I am on a bit of an ""Asian Thriller / Horror"" kick at the moment. One of the movies I recently purchased was ""Cello"". The movie certainly has promise yet it has an overall feeling of being disjointed. The premise is good, the acting is ok, the cinematography is good... and yet... the story itself feels very jerky.It actually feels like the director was using the discontinuity to try and hide the twists in the plot (ie you cant tell if the odd event was important by its inexplicablity or whether it was just bad editing).Don't get me wrong, ""Cello"" is worth watching, its just not a ""must have"" in a collection. There are other movies with similar themes which work much better - ""A Tale of Two Sisters"" being a good example."
4,VERY GOOD FILM,I AM A BIG FAN OF ASIAN HORROR AND I HAVE SEEN IT ALL. YES ITS A TYPICAL REVENGE FILM BUT ITS VERY WELL DONE WITH A NICE PLOT AND SOME PRETTY GOOD SCARES :)
2,"Boring. Bad Acting, Bad Directing Most Of All","The suspenseful setting was set in place, only thing missing was that this movie really just didn't have it.The scary ghost lady in the movie isn't even scary! I make plain reviews just to go right out and say it. I'm not going to fabricate everything with complicated words.This movie was boring and unoriginal. At least make the ghost/demon look scary, it just looks like a normal lady with wide eyes. Honestly, all these Asian chicks look like the ghost, they're all Asian folks with a scary faces. It's like sometimes I can't tell the difference if I'm either seeing a demon or just another Asian chick in the movie. You know the movie is bad because they can't even make a good enough ghost to help you tell the difference.Don't waste your time, but if you want to watch it out of curiousity, go ahead. I thought it was going to be great, boy was I bored out of my mind."
4,More Thriller than Horror,"Cello is a unique story for this genre. To me, it felt more like a thriller (something like What Lies Beneath (2000)instead of a horror movie like Ringu. The acting in Cello is great. The story is interesting and a little more personal than most horror movies. It does seem like the build up is a little long and drawn out before you get to the ending, but the ending was satisfying. There are some holes and some disjointed moments in the film, and I wondered if that was because the translation was off? I have always loved the Cello as an instrument and the music in this film is quite beautiful.Overall I enjoyed watching it and was pleased that I rented it."
4,A Great Book For what It Was Intended,"Sometimes I see people give this series of books ""so so"" reviews. This book, and others in the Pual White ""Basic"" series are made to be a small reference book. These books are about the size of a pocket dictionary, plus it only cost 8 bucks. If you are looking for something that has every detail on the subject just keep looking. If you need something that gives a good overview and makes a good book to throw in a gig bag, this is the book you are looking for."
5,Clarks Atethis Shoes,"I have worn these shoes many, many times. True to size.The picture also is ""what you see is what you get"".I wear these shoes most anywhere, even to work.I would recommend this shoe. Heal height is justperfect for those who can't wear those ""Spike""Shoes."
5,A great compilation,"It's time to know about this Nobel Prize. This book is a perfect answer to know. Is not an elemental for everybody. if yor area is the literature this is a great kind to know diferent perpectives of Vargas LLosa, the Peruvian and studies."
2,Morgan Great. Kindle forman difficult,"Looked forward to using the commentary. However, the Kindle format makes it difficult to use. A table of contens to enable the reader to navigate through the book would be invaluable. Hopefully, the format will be revised, because Morgan is a commentator who can make any text come alive. Unfortuenately, it is a slow death using it."
2,"Bendon are getting there, but still have a ways to go at this point.","Anonymous, <strong>Sesame Beginnings: Eyes, Nose, Fingers, Toes</strong> (Bendon Publishing, 2006)Points off for lack of information (no author listed).We liked this one somewhat better than Bubbles, Bubbles! (q.v.), if only because the rhyme scheme was more coherent here--it feels more like it was written by one person than by (inept) committee. It's another that doesn't get pulled out a great deal since the little guy started expressing conscious opinions on what we should be reading, but we return to it now and again, once every few weeks or so. Not awful, but nothing to spend time hunting down. **"
2,Bleah.,"No author listed, <strong>Sesame Beginnings: At the Zoo</strong> (Publisher unknown, 2009)Points off for lack of information (almost everything).Another written-by-committee quick cash grab, with no author or publisher listed, trading on the Sesame Street brand name in order to sell cheap books. Doesn't even have the upside of being well-written or cute enough to make up for the missing metadata; not one the kid reaches for, ever, when picking out something for us to read to him, and in matters of pre-lit, the kid's decisions are the great arbiter. *"
3,british cinema vol 2.,The movies in this set are great but some of the transfers are only just average.But apart from this they of good value.I really enjoy british films so please keep releasing them.They arrived ahead of scheduled time thanks to amazon.Ken BarrettMooroolbarkAustalia
3,The Caucasus,"Decent book about the turbulent Caucasus region. Part history, part travelogue, the author traveled around the region with a filmmaker, photographer and translator. There are some interesting and comical incidents along the way as they meet and live with the locals of Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia. They even briefly visit Chechnya despite the danger of kidnappings and war with Russia. I would have liked more coverage of Armenia which is essentialy dealt with in a few pages. Most of the history part deals with Imam Shamil, the legendary Avar warrior who gave the Russians hell for decades. I thought this was overkill. The most famous Caucasian, Stalin, is dealt with in a single paragraph. Quite amusing were the antics of the ""translator"" Ilya, a rambunctious Uzbek Jew whose broken English hardly qualifies him for the position. The author's travels took place around 1999 so the book is dated but worth the read if you're interested."
3,not his best,"Bruce Cockburn is my favorite song writer, but this album was something of a disappointment. For one thing, too much droning. For another, poorly crafted lyrics. For another (not his fault) his voice is definately showing his age. But it does have a few decent pieces, and of course belongs in any complete collection. If new to Cockburn, his stuff from the 90s would be a better introduction."
2,Recycled,"I am a long time Bruce Cockburn fan, and I have found this CD his most dissapointing ever. When I listen to his earlier work, there is such care and craft with melody. These songs seem to be built around chord patterns that only change between the verse and the chorus. The song construction is repetitive and it all has a rehashed sound.In the documentary ""The Life and Times of Bruce Cockburn"" it speaks of him having severe writer's block. It would appear that the ideas are coming more slowly now. The last album I really enjoyed was BREAKFAST IN NEW ORLEANS, DINNER IN TIMBUKTU. Beyond that the past few years have been lean ones.It is difficult to recommend this cd unless you are a rabid fan who needs every release."
4,Life in the old dog yet.,"Bruce is over 60 now so I didn't bother buying this thinking that he is well past his ""use by date"".I eventually bought it anyway and discovered that every track is really good. I have it in the car and I listen to it a lot. This is not Bruce's best album, but its proof that there's life in the old dog yet."
5,Life short call now,"Life Short Call Now by Bruce Cockburn is an excellent collection of songs. I purchased it before one of my trips, taking it with me and thoroughly made an impact of enjoyment while drive across the plains. This is one of favorite Cockburn albums of his career.Douglas, Atlanta"
1,A Low Point for Bruce Cockburn,"Bruce Cockburn released a series of great albums starting with Dancing in the Dragon's Jaws to the superb Charity of Night. However, beginning with Breakfast in New Orleans..Dinner in Timbuktu and now Life Short Call Now, Cockburn has been on a downward spiral. This album is just plain bad with only 2 decent songs on the whole CD. This is simply my opinion. It's just disappointing that Cockburn cannot produce a great album like he once did."
1,Really Bad,"For the first time ever I am not looking forward to Bruce putting out music in the future. The last cd ""You've Never Seen Everything"" was disappointing by Bruce standards but still had a few good songs. Life Short Call Now is the first genuinely bad Cockburn cd. It has almost nothing going for it - uninteresting music, bland lyrics, obtrusive over-production. I know Bruce is getting old but I think he needs to take at least a few years off before putting out anything new. His latest music is tired and uninspired."
1,This stinks,"I got a free copy of this CD and am shipping it to a friend tomorrow. No melodies, poor harmonies, no rhythm, this CD sucks. It is self important and lacks musical merit. Disturbingly discordant and shallow: two listens was all I could stomach."
5,pleasure,"I lost my Encarta when I bought a new computer, so I bought this new edition. Res Ipsa Loquitor"
1,Wouldn't buy,Poor support and updates. Has a lot of info you can get elsewhere on the web. Also don't need the kids games.
5,Great knowledge!!,"I had already bought this for my son a year ago, but I mistankenly had deleted it from the computer, started to search websites and they no longer had it. Went into Amazon and there was only one. I bought it and it arrived real fast, I downloaded into computer and its just great. My son loves it, and besides when-ever he wants to search a word it speaks the answer. Its also great to search history which my son is into to. I would give it a 10, for being the most precise software and fun to work with. Thanks!!"
5,Disasterlad on Encarta 2007,I enjoy using Encarta 2007 and can relie upon their information. I use it in conjunction with Britannica 2007 to get the most well rounded information. I do prefer the interface and ease to Britannica 2007 but the quality of information on Britannica is always to be trusted.My advice you need to buy both
2,Encarta by microsoft,"Very awesome program for adults and chidren,lots of information on the kids encarta.My son is in first grade and he needed to find some information on money from around the world he did it all himself."
3,Good,"I have this Encarta and the Student version. I like the student version better, but this is good if you are not a student. I got this one before I realized about the student version, and I am a college student."
3,Some regrets,"I regret that Microsoft has removed items I had on my last edition (2005)-Archives (1938-1994) are not any longer on the DVD-Rom : you have to look for them on the Encarta Premium website on which you are allowed to go for a limited time (18 months I believe).-Encarta Africana has fully disapeared either on the DVD or on the website : why ? It gave an interesting point of view on lots of items.-You can't focus on a particular place of the world atlas with drawing lines which were more accurate than the new system for spotting and printing.As a piece of advice, I should tell to the owners of pre-2006 editions of Encarta Premium to keep preciously their software if they want to have all these items !It's only for these light critics above that I give a three stars to this edition instead of a four or five.And obviously for updating its personnal base of knowledge, I say that it's still interesting to buy the new Microsoft Encarta Premium 2007 edition."
2,Disappointing,"I tend to really enjoy books on culinary history; unfortunately this one left me wanting more. The chapters are disjointed, with no true unifying theme. The prose is stilted, though I suspect alot of this is due to poor translation. The information itself is good, but badly presented; overall a boring mess of a book. Pick up Tannahill's ""Food in History"" instead."
3,Very Intresting Book,"This book was a required text for our culinary 101 class at the John Folse Culinary Institute at Nicholls State University. I believe the culinary history book was very informative and intriguing. It contained very useful information about many culinary aspects. It explained the foods and food preparations used in the ancient times, and also explained how the foods and food preparations that we use today came to be. The book also helped me to gain knowledge of why we eat certain foods and why we eat the way we do. This is a great book to use as a guide to food of yesterday and today. It is a very informative book that I will definitely keep throughout my culinary career."
2,"I didn't really enjoy ""Food: A culinary History""","This book was required as part of my culinary history class. It is easy to read, but I didn't find it very entertaining. I know that it is supposed to be informative, but I didn't find it attention grabbing. I felt like I had to look up every word to understand what the book was trying to say. I didn't see where it actually flowed with the class syllabus. The book talks about the history of food and how religion and culture are incolved. I didn't have a hard time reading the book, but I had a hard following where the book was going with the information. I thought that some of the information was interesting, but most of the text was all facts. I guess if you want to read about culinary history, then this is the book for you. If you read this book for enjoyment and pleasure I'm afraid that this book won't be very entertaining. I'm glad that I have read the book for future information and knowledge."
3,Review as a Textbook,"I was required to read this text for a college class in which I am enrolled. I am a culinary arts student. I found this text to be very informative. The information given in this book was interesting to learn about, though it was not presented in the most ideal way. I had trouble keeping interest in the book. Some parts were easy to read while others seemed to drag on and on. Had this book been presented in a more story like fashion it would have been easier to read leisurely. As far as using this text in a classroom, it is a very resourceful tool. I found that the information helped me better understand how the history of culinary influences our culinary practices today."
2,My Book Review,"This book was required for my CULA 101 class and i found it very hard to understand some of the terms used in the text. I know the book was translated from french to english, nut i feel that the book is on a level that on professionals of the highest ranking can understand. I would hate to say it, but if you ""dummy down"" the book, i am sure more people would be able to understand it."
1,Not Recommended for Your Textbook,"This book was used as my textbook for my culinary 101 class. It was very informative and traces the roots of culinary history and evolution very well, but as a class textbook, I do not recommend it. I found it hard to keep up with and it was too lengthy for one semester. I found myself getting lost in the book. If you want a culinary history foundation book, this is a great one, but not as a textbook."
2,A Broad Textbook,"Although I am extremely interested in the culinary arts, I do not enjoy reading and therefore I found myself getting bogged down in this extremely lengthy book. I had to read the book for my culinary arts class but do not think it should be required for a first year student. Some students might become intimidated by the vast amount of information that is given to them so quickly. Some of the history is interesting but I guess I was expecting to learn more about the actual cooking procedures. I'm sure I will use this book as a reference through out my culinary training, but I think it was too broad for use as a textbook."
2,"Informative reading: YES, Class Textbook: No","This book, Food: A Culinary History was used as a textbook for my culinary 101 class at NSU. This book had many key culinary terms that i have not yet learned which made it difficult to understand at first. This book made me research a lot of these term to find out the meanings. After reading through the first few chapters i began to have a better understanding. The book was very informative on the history of early cooking. this book shows you the culinary developments over centuries. Even though the book was very informative i would have not picked it for a culinary 101 textbook. First of all, it was somewhat hard reading for fresh college students and, secondly, it was not set in the way a textbook should be. Textbooks are usually simpler and explain the idea in fewer words. For a textbook it was a whole lot of reading."
2,Trial Textbook: Doesn't make the grade in my book,"Food: A Culinary History was the required text for my Culinary History class at Chef John Folse Culinary Institute at Nicholls State University. On the whole, it is an informative reference book with a wealth of information covering an overwhelming amount of culinary history. However, it is more suitably written and organized for research purposes and was not a complimentary learning tool for our class since the book focuses on the European perspective and our objectives were more global."
2,"nope, didn't like it","this was the text book for my culinary history class this semester. the book has some very valuable information, but it is explained in such a way that it becomes boring and unentertaining. It becomes difficult to understand from the very first chapter due to large words that are rarely explained. you might as well purchase a dictionary and a thesaurus when you purchase this book. Amazon makes very easy and somewhat affordable. But seriously, only buy this book if you have a large vocabulary or ever plan on having one. The overall information contained in the textbook is very good, and, from what the instructor has told me, very accurate as well. I'm sure that there are text books better than this one for a student, but if you are an instructor, then i'm sure it's great for research. I give this book a two out of five...from a student's point-of-view."
3,embroidery in color please,"This book is both great and really dissapointing. All the inside photo's with gorgeous designs are in black and white, hiding all the beauty and color of the items. I feel cheated the cover has a breathtaking color photo of the red and gold fish box, and then you open to no color. It does give good solid information on how to design, embroider boxes, cushions, purses etc..."
3,ok,this jeans is more baggy than it actually looks in the picture. .. which is good if you like that kind of thing.. i was hoping for a little more fitted jeans
3,Better than working without pants,These jeans are good considering their price. The cut is slightly snug in the seat and legs. Also perhaps the legs are a bit longer than normal. And it's a good idea to wash these at least twice on their own as they bleed dye profusely.
4,"Good price, but they are very rigid!","Rigid is an understatement, if that's possible. I'm sure that these jeans are very hard wearing, and will probably last a long time. I washed and hung them up, came back a day later and almost had to snap them in half. I actually took them off the hanger (they were hung with clips on the belt line) and stood them up on their own, where they stayed upright all night. It was quite an amazing sight! I put them back through the washer and then into the dryer this time, with 2 bounce sheets, and they are much better now. Still a little stiff, but I am hoping they will get better with time.Overall, they are great value for money, but I was hoping for something a little softer."
3,different fit,"Nice pants very durable; kinda strange fit though. I don't have large hips but these pants are very tight in the hips and not in the waist. As I wear them they ride up, after wearing them for half an hour or so the hips don't feel too tight but the waist is still too big and they don't settle down. love the color and stitching but when you have to wear a belt that makes the waist bunch up because they don't sit right it is not ideal.bottom line: if you know that dickies fit you well, great cheap pants. If not, you might want to try them on in a store to find the right size or to see if they will even fit you right."
3,Workclothes,"Bought five pairs of these Jeans as a gift. First pair taken out of package was missing the button on front. I replaced it myself to avoid the hassel of returning them. They should have been checked out before they were shipped. Other than that, they do the job. They are workclothes and the price was right."
4,Dickies - Built Tough,"Got these for my husband. They are true to size and fit nicely. The color is lighter than picutred, but they still look good. The material is stiff. The name Rigid Jean is correct. That just makes them really durable. For the price, these are chepaer than wally world jeans."
5,great value!,"I bought these jeans for my husband and he looks so GOOD in them. He also says they are very comfortable. Although he wears these to work in a machine shop, they seem to be holding up well. These jeans are definitely a great value and we will be buying more!"
5,great jeans,"these are tough, rigid and my son loves them. they look good too. they are really wash and wear jeans - easy to care for. great for work or play. great buy."
2,size way off,"be carful with the sizes. Different brands fit differently. I've been buying dickies for years. If you can get the right fit they last and last but beware dickies makes pants sizes that, according to the measurement they should be the same from one pair to the other, but when you put them on, it's a totally different story."
5,Rigid baby!!,RIGID... Just what I expected they are very stiff but hopefully after ah couple washes they soften ah lil bit it nonetheless I am 100% satisfied
2,Dickies Spacepants,"These pants were not what I expected. These are really tough...almost kevlar type material...no joke. I can barely move with them on lol. I would recommend these when trekking through rosebushes, pirana tanks, and snow(probably not bad in the winter, but if these pants freeze up, you will be stuck...I guarantee it). Maybe you just need to wear it down, but I don't have years to do that so I say pass on these. Dickies probably have other jeans a lot better than these."
2,Hope you enjoy ironing,"Wow, these jeans come out of the dryer more wrinkled than any other pair of jeans that I own. I am hoping if I wash them enough times, they will be more forgiving. We'll see."
2,The Good and the Bad,"The good: these pants were cheap, and I only bought one pair to see if I liked them, so not much money lost.The bad: everything else. The stitching is orange/gold (not shown in picture), which looks hideous. And the material can only be made from cardboard. It's the only way to describe the feel. I don't know how anyone could possibly wear these consistently. The inside of the pockets in particular feel horrible (again, like cardboard). It feels like the cheapest pair of pants that could possibly be made (hence, the price). I learned my lesson: you get what you pay for."
5,Excellent Product,"I purchased these jeans for my husband who works in the oilfield, thinking they would suffice for their price. However, my husband refuses to wear them to the worksite, believing they are much better quality and fit. I agree. The jeans are excellent for the price & their fit is true to size. We will continue to order Dickie jeans in the future, great quality for the price."
2,These are work jeans!,"Do not mistake these for casual jeans - they are a working man's jeans. Quality is good. However, they are not the type that most would wear with a dress shirt as casual sports wear. They would be best suited when you are out trimming trees, hauling in hay, farm work, or construction type work. That being said they are suitable for hard work and will hold up well. The cut is very loose allowing for lots of movement. If this is what you are looking for then this may be the type of denim and cut that you would be happy with."
4,Rugged Work Pants,"My husband is a welder by trade and needs a really rugged jean to hold up under the conditions that he works in. He was very pleased with the quality and fit of these jeans and believe me if he didn't think they would hold up he would let me know. I usually buy him Levi's at JC Penney for at least twice the price. We thought they were fairly heavy duty but this material appears much more durable. I would not recommend them for a ""dress jean"" as they just don't have the look that we would want, but for casual and demanding work these appear to be the answer. The price is excellent. We ended up buying him six pair. I'd give them a 5 star rating but haven't washed them yet. After I've washed them several times I'll try to add some more information."
2,"Sizes are not consistent,","I have worn 38 X 34 jeans for years so that's what I ordered and they were way, way too small. I returned them and ordered 40 X 34. They were way, way to big but they are not pre-washed or shrunk so I figured they would shrink to fit. I was wrong.They did shrink but not nearly enough. After 4 wash and dry cycles they are still HUGE on me and way to long. But they are cheap.I will NOT buy them again."
2,Not sized correctly,"These jeans are heavy duty and look pretty good on. But, they are sized wrong. They are 2 inches longer than the size tag says."
4,quick delivery,I ordered these work jeans for my husband and was very pleased with the quality. They were the same as in the store (but the right size is hard to find around here). They were delivered very quickly which is always a plus.
3,so much color came off!!!,"so i orderd this pair of jeans because i liked the color and some very good reviews were up there.i got it,opened up the package and the jeans were stiff as hell as promised in the reviews,got to washing it as advised but instead of using the washing machine as i had done the laundry a day before i got to washing it manually in my bath-tub and was surprised the amount of color it gave off with water,i just kept coming off...hopefully it will sort out with few washes but i definately wont be washing other of my clothes in the load....ANY BODY WHO HAD THE SIMILAR ISSUES???.............other than this the jeans do appear durable only if the color lasts;)"
3,Shipping time too long,This jeans was more than i expected. I ordered it for work but it was to much of a good quality. Took over a month or so to get to me. Shipping time was just too long.
2,Not as pictured,"Was very disappointed when I ordered this that even though it shows a picture of the complete disc/caliper, it does not actually include the caliper...after I got it, I went back and looked at the description and found that it did say at the bottom that it did not include it, but they should show a picture of just the disc if that is all that you get!"
2,Loved them but so stretched out after just a few wearings,I loved these shoes at first but they just kept getting so stretched out and now are at least half a size too big and I'll have to find someone with bigger feet to give them to!
2,ok shoe's,"I got the brown and natural leather colors and didnt like them at all. The shoe was very comfortable. However, the colors were not as described. The natural leather looks more like a sparkly gold and the brown looks more like a redish brick color. I returned them both. The shoes were true to size. Great shoe. Only in different colors would be better!"
3,Potential problem with quick releases on camera strap,"Length:: 1:56 MinsWhile I liked the comfort of the Tamrac N-25 camera strap, I found the quick-release hardware to be problematic. In many years of photography, I've seldom had cause to remove a strap. I think most photographers will never use the quick-release feature. Unused features usually aren't a problem, but the buckles could damage the display screens of digital cameras. I think most photographers would be better off with the buckle-less N-19."
3,It *smells*,"The N25 strap is comfortable and its quick release is handy. But, I hate to say it, the rubber smells like sour farts. And before long, your collar does too, all on its own. Maybe mine was improperly cured or something, but until such time as web sites have .pong files to let you sniff in advance, you might want to think twice."
5,Great strap,This is a huge improvement over the strap that came with my canon rebel XS. I used it all day at multiple theme parks and never had any issues. I wear it over the shoulder not around the neck which makes it more comfortable. The length put it right at waste level which made it very comfortable. Only complaint is that is has to many plastic adjustments which could break. So far no real issues though.
4,"Love the strap, but you might want to think twice if you are six feet all or move","Love the strap, very comfortable. But if you are six feet tall or more and you want the camera to hand lower than the middle of your chest, look elsewhere. I havemine set to the longest possible setting and it is barely long enough."
3,wish it were longer but is very comfortable.,"I like to carry my camera to the side with one arm inside the strap. This strap (and most others) are not quite long enough to do that and then pull the camera to the eye. It is better than most because the neoprene will slide a bit easier. The stretchy give of the neoprene does notably improve the comfort.I rated it 3, because I just don't understand why a few more inches of nylon on the adjustable portion of the strap is so hard to find. This is true of all the tamrac's I've seen. Otherwise, really good."
3,Too short for neck+shoulder style wear,"Neoprene is much more comfortable than any ""stock"" strap and electric blue stands out in a crowd of black accessories, but this strap is just too short to be useful to me. I'm average height (5'11"") but have broad shoulders and a thick chest. When I put this strap around my neck and shoulders (the way you *should* wear a strap) there was so little slack that my NikonNikon D5100stuck straight out awkwardly rather than hanging down naturally. Making pictures was out of the question.The little ladies and bean-pole men among the prospective buyers may be happy with this strap, but if you've done a lot of push-ups (or cheese-its, as the case may be) you'll want to look for something longer.PS- As for alternatives, I've got aLeica strapon order. It's a little more expensive, but it comes highly recommended by Ken Rockwell, and the Amazon reviewers seem unanimously satisfied."
4,"Close, but still looking for the perfect strap!","Its name says it all! - I assume N25 refers to its width in millimeters, just right for an SLR, and black so you are not a walking billboard for the camera manufacturer. The soft and stretchy neoprene makes carrying a camera much more comfortable, though it does not slide so easily as other materials. I could do without the quick release - it just adds clunkiness to the strap and though the quick-releases seem strong they could be a weak point? The rest of the construction seems very well-made and I particularly like the way each camera attachment strap has two friction buckles - other straps I've had with only a single buckle have sometimes slipped and become detached. So, streamline the thing doing away with the quick releases would earn five stars, but in the meantime it's four and I'm still looking!"
2,Steve Madden Women's Bair Thong Espadrille,"These shoes look great on, however are extremely uncomfortable. They run VERY small in size (I went up 1 1/2 sizes from what I normally wear in SM brand).I would not recommend them as shoes you would wear for more than an hour at a time because the thong portion cuts into your skin and the arches in the heels are so high that they put alot of pressure on the ball of your foot."
3,Mislabeled,I purchased this game pack with the understanding it included the card game bridge. It does not. Oops.
5,The best resource directory I've found...,"This book is by far the best resource directory I've ever used (and I use it all the time!). Until I bought this book I was very limited at finding resources to sell my antiques and collectibles. Now it's the only thing I use, it covers anything and everything collectible and it gives you collectors that buy/sell, museums, libraries, clubs, etc. It's a must have book for the collector and re-sellers."
2,For beginners only; bad video quality,"For beginners only. Not worth buying if you already play pool.Video sync signal is weak, probably in an attempt to prevent unauthorized copying, but the picture breaks up often as a result."
1,Oktoberfest!!! The Definitive Guide,"Oktoberfest!!! The Definitive Guide to German BeerOfficial German Beer Guide""Oktoberfest!! The Defenitive Guide to German Beer"" and ""The Official German Beer Guide"" are the same DVD, so avoid purchasing both like I did.In fact, I wish I had bought neither!The first 30 mins of the DVD is great; a concise history, followed by an excellent presentation on how beer is made.The section that follows is in black and white, it is basically shot from the same angle and the subject is a group of friends tasting beers. Their comments aren't particularly insightful ... it is really boring.The final section is a cooking segment which is charming in its authenticity but not very visually appealing.Oktoberfest is barely even mentioned on the whole DVD."
4,Plenty to chew,"Well done introduction to a wide variety of technical components in the various processes for which he guides the reader into exploring. I would have like to see his section on optics and lenses better explained though more graphs, drawings, etc. A must have book if you are at all mechanically inclined and like to tinker in photography. Also it works for someone who has no intention on building any of the items but would like to know more about the processes of photography. My one gripe is the content of the photos; illustrating salt prints, various effects of toning solutions, etc. leaves a little bit to be desired. Because of slow shutter speeds there are far too many building and static structures and not enough other subjects. Of course this might reflect Mr. Greene's artistic vision, but it limits the power of the illustrative examples because of the simularity of subject matter."
4,"Cute book, not religious at all.","This is a very baby artful book, if you are looking for a nice baby book without religious sayings in it than this will be great for you."
5,Amazing for the Price.,"Sigma has hit a winner with this lens.I purchased it as an 'enthusiast' to get the best pictures possible. About 6 months later I was working as a full time professional photographer, and this lens saw constant and consistent use for a period of 9 months, for both portraits and in weddings.The lens never failed me, and more importantly, the quality of photos out of it is amazing. Just brilliant. Clear. Bokeh is really nice and soft. DOF at f/2.8 is amazing.Lens is obviously heavier than 'cheaper' lenses, but is worth the weight. The tripod mount collar is also perfectly placed, and was used quite a bit.I recomend this lens without hesitation. Also with it's quality, you are better off with this lens zooming at 200mm and then cropping than with a cheaper 300mm lens. It is that good."
4,Two Johns from Connecticut connect,Great straight-ahead jazz guitar from two creative guitarist that don't play in this type of mode often. I don't understand why this has been buried in the bins for years and was late in coming out on CD. A must for jazz guitar fans.
4,Josh Todd,"A great album. A disappointment to see BuckCherry break up but the voice of Josh Todd gives a feel that BuckCherry lives on with musical modifications that give this album its own distinct sound. Instant favorites on this album with great expectations of what is to come. For example, ""flowers and cages"" and ""circles"" shows a more mature side of josh todd that evolved from BuckCherry. This album recieves four out of five stars obviously because it isn't BuckCherry. Listen and enjoy, great music here."
3,Disappointing,"I usually like Asian cinema, and liked ""Twilight,"" but I just wasn't crazy about ""Hidden Blade."" The movie is about pre-Meiji Japan and the rapidly changing role of the samurai (same time period as theThe Last Samurai). However, I never really connected to the characters or the plot. It is also somewhat slow until the last 40 minutes.The movie itself looks much older and drabber than something that came out only a few years ago. I loved other Japanese movies that portray bright and rich colors, but everything in ""Hidden Blade"" seemed so brown and dark. The scene with the person getting his hand shot off looked like 1950s special effects.I will say this, if you're considering watching ""Hidden Blade"" and theThe Last Samurai, ""Hidden Blade"" is much more authentic."
2,The plot is too similar to the Twilight Samuri,"The jacket of the DVD says ""From the director of the twilight samurai.""Unfortunately, the plot is too close to twilight for it to seem like much of a different movie."
3,Not What I Thought...,They are excellent DVD's 5 star in fact BUT I really thought that the ABC's DVD would atleast cover the entire alphabet. It basically covers the letters which begin with the characters names only. I was a little disappointed but better then any other DVD where they learn ZIP. (...)
4,Nice package that includes extra flash cards,The 2 DVD's come in their own box which also includes numbers and letter flash cards. I found that the ABC video was more about rhyming and beginning reading than about learning your ABC's. The kids love it just like any other Winnie the Pooh video but the included flash cards are very good and more helpful for actually teaching your child their ABC's and 123's
3,Unique,Was really looking for a print. It arrived quickly. No problems but I do not like the requirements for writing a bunch of stuff on each item
3,Better than expected.,"A creative (meaning not done before, at least quite like this) story of a mistreated, humiliated-at-school goth/loner teen who wouldn't mind some payback upon his tormentors. His struggling, single mom requests that he acquires an after school job (when he bothers to go to school) which ends being with a lonely grizzled crossword puzzle solving cremator (my suspicions about crossword types is now confirmed) who doesn't take kindly to unkind people thus making good use of his skills which his newly hired help is only to willing to also acquire.Nothing too bloody, just the usual red dyed corn syrup splattered in a non-forensically accurate manner. The acting by Dourif carries the movie, but then he has had decades to hone this particular portrayal given the number of horror and crime acting jobs he's had."
3,Interesting premise that goes unfulfilled,"Dourif and Sumpter do a good job as the creepy cremation guy who kills and cremates for no particular reason and the young teenager who is bullied at school and needs a father figure, even one who is messed up.There is no explanation for the crematorium-crazy guy or how his own rotten childhood sent him into this obsession."
2,kind of disappointing,"I got this at my husband's request. He thought it was a hoot. I didn't like the few shows I watched, couldn't justify spending more time watching. Poor quality,repeating scenes in spots. Glad I didn't pay much for it."
1,Mill Creek Strike Again,"Well Amazon saw that it got here on time and in good condition. First mistake was getting here at all. It is the worse collection of of cult crap I have seen. Just not what I was expecting. I will make Mill creek happy and give this sad presentation one star. Mill Creek is up to their standard,rotten, the films are bad , the acting is worse. You can pass this one up and save yourself some money and retain your sanity . Hey I should have known better. Shame on me."
1,Mill Creek Bad,I have purchased several DVD's by Mill Creek and will never purchase another one. I have gone through three DVD players trying to watch some of these movies. They are so bad that they literally destroyed the players. After returning the third player I was told that the store would no longer replace another player and I should quit trying to play the Mill Creek DVD's. That was two years ago and I am still using the same player since. And I have gotten rid of all Mill Creek DVD's in my library.
2,Was not what I was expecting.,I purchased this box set for my boyfriend who is a huge movie buff. I guess we just weren't sure what to expect out of movies from the 30's and 40's. So far there is not one movie in the set that we have enjoyed.
3,title misunderstood,never heard of almost all off the movies most where too short some where prettygood low price saved this product from lowing rank
3,"Great Movies, but they are Edited","If you are looking for complete versions of these films, this is not the Collection to buy. Multiple films have been edited and are not full prints."
3,Classics To Be Sure...,"...but temper your expectations. The movies in this collection have suffered the ravages of time. Many of the story lines are difficult to follow; there are missing segments that make watching these movies similar to listening to a record that skips with every full rotation. If you're looking for quality, look elsewhere. If you have a morbid curiosity about early anti-drug and temperance propoganda, look no further."
4,In Wal-Mart's $5 bin!,"I found this in Wal-Mart's $5 bin (I know, I know, I shouldn't shop there...you are probably right but hey, they have that $5 bin). It was well worth $5! Some of the stuff is really funny and awfully strange. ""Child Bride"" is right out of the headlines here (close to the Polygamy Capital of Texas). Most of the movies are exploitation flicks probably originally presented as having some sort of medically or morally redeeming value--they don't. Anyway, if you are into strange old movies, splurge and don't wait to find this box in that $5 bin--go ahead and spend the whole $8.47. ""Child Bride"" alone is worth that."
4,Not Too Shabby At All,"Our expectations for this DVD set were in the middle range; we figured that it was a pretty cheap investment with the possible payoff of a few laughs. We've been pleasantly surprised to find that the set is full of a lot of laughs, gasps, and OMG-moments. Sure, the quality is a bit muddied in places; and, sure, some of the movies are just so bad they're bad (as opposed to so bad they're good). That being said, though, there are some great moments on the DVDs, and the set was more than worth the price we paid. ""Reefer Madness"" is a classic in and of itself - and if you've never seen ""Terror of Tiny Town,"" or ""Marihuana,"" you need to; those movies alone are worth the price we paid for the whole set. However, there are many others to enjoy and it's all gravy after that, you know?We will definitely be ordering more movies from Amazon - including a few more of these classic sets."
4,Grant Wheel,"I put this on my wife's Polaris RZR. Great Grant product, well made. The color is a little on the pink side. We were expecting more red. But overall a great product at a great price."
3,Good deal,My issue is that I can get 4 times more popcorn for the same price from another vendor. Other than that it was the best for flavor and size of kernels.
1,"Poor Presentation, Lack of Depth","I can only imagine that those reviewers who sing and dance over this book have never had a serious look at Itzykson & Zuber's text on quantum field theory, which is incomparibly clearer in its presentation, much better organized and gives fuller, deeper treatment of the subjects. P&S spend almost 100 pages describing renomalization and in the end prove nothing. It suffers from a terrible lack of foundations of QFT and their discussions often lapse into worthless gibberish. The authors simply don't demonstrate a clear understanding of the principles of the subject and have cooked up a hodge-podge of this and that. Get Streater and Wightman's book ""PCT, Spin ..."" for a rigorous treatment of the basics of QFT and learn the subject from I&Z."
1,This book is miserable!,"I consider myself to be a good physics student, I never had trouble with self study from books, if they were any good.This book is, in my opinion, just awful.The exposition of subjects is with no depth, most arguments are based on ""physical intuition"" that maybe professors, after many years, have - most of the time you simply don't understand why the Hell X implies Y like they say.They just slap the formulas on the page, with simply not enough justification, using all sorts of ""physically obvious"" or ""we can expect that this will be"" arguments.No depth, no depth, no depth.Look in L. Brown's book, you will see a beautifull construction of a theory, that's they way it should look like."
1,Kindle,"W/r to the Kindle edition:Why would you buy the Kindle edition for $50 when the original hardback print is $70? Its ridiculous - either it only costs $20 to physically publish the book, in which case the author and buyers are both being ripped off by the enormous publisher profit, or it costs more than 20$ to physically publish the book, and they're still charging for part of that cost for the Kindle Edition.Kindle textbooks are a rip-off."
1,How To Do Calculations,"Peskin and Schroeder is not a book intended for those who wish appreciate the underlying principles or myriad subtleties of quantum field theory. The book merely ""teaches"" one to calculate. Texts which can be used in conjunction with P&S to address its weaknesses include those by Weinberg and Ryder."
5,"Engaging, family-value enhancing, inexpensive, wholesome","ThingamaKid has released two new attention engaging, family-value enhancing, inexpensive, wholesome, DVD/CD combo disc, animated music entertainments for young children. ""Toddler Toons"" is designed for preschoolers ages 2 to 5. The CD version features 16 delightful numbers ranging from 'The Muffin Man' to 'Baa, Baa, Black Sheep'. The accompanying DVD shares 13 of the same songs - but also includes as a bonus feature an educational short."
5,Your kids will love this!!,"I had been looking for a sing along DVD that both of my kids would like and this far surpassed my expectations. My 1 year old was dancing the minute it started and when the first song ended my 4 year old was asking ""what song is next""? They were glued to the TV from start to finish. What is nice about this DVD is that the kids see the story with the animation, as opposed to just watching kids sing. That way they get to know what the song is all about. Get this DVD and the others offered by Thingamakid. You won't be dissapointed!"
3,Cute looking but hard to disassemble,"This is a super cute bed. I loved it once I saw it. We had hoped to put our almost two year old into this bed and wean her off of the crib to make room for our next child.Problem, we assembled it in our bedroom. Buyer beware! Once we assembled this bed, we had a hard time dissassembling it. The parts snap into place and are almost impossible to take a part. Not exactly a bad thing. But it won't fit through a normal door, no matter how you angle it.Also, once the mattress is in the bed, the sides are not that high. If your child is still rolling in bed, they can definitely roll off if they have enough momentum.My child just loves to play in the car bed but has yet to sleep in it. I'm still hopefull that our child will sleep in this bed.Otherwise very cute and very sturdy."
1,Too much fun - anti-sleep!,"We got this for our son, and it looked too much like a toy or jungle gym. He spent most of his time crawling out the windows and climbing back in through the hole in the roof. Great fun, but we did much better on **sleeping** when we went to a boring, bed-looking toddler bed."
1,Low/No Quality Water Bottle,"When the Tamrac Water Bottle in the Padded case arrived, the top of the plastic water bottle would not seal. While Tamrac builds quality products this is not one of them. I own other products from Tamrac and I expected more from this company. If you order this product plan to replace the water bottle before going on a trip. Normally I would return a defective product but replacing like-for-like accomplishes nothing. The padded case has value but you have to decide if the cost (without the water bottle) is worth it."
4,Buy this for the carrier not the bottle,"Title says it all. All of the other reviews are correct in that the bottle is a cheap carnival giveaway. I expected that going in but really wanted the holder for my SIGG bottle - which fits nice and cozy. I put a small carabiner at the top to secure it (not that it needs one, you just never know) and works great. Great addition to my tamrac bag, just pretend you didn't see the bottle."
5,Just Ok,"Okay...I got this item recently and I found it just okay...I liked the Padded Carrier which is excellent in quality, materials, and finishing. However; the Water Bottle is not that good.The thickness of the bottle water is quite thin which results in quick loss of cold... Although it's most of the time inside the padded carrier, however that wont help a lot... it is a very standard water bottle but has Tamrac Logo only.Over all, it's Just OK"
3,Works,"For those shoots that are long, I like the fact I can attach this to the bag and have a drink readily available. Is expensive for what it is but does work as advertised."
2,Not a true 'Flush' cut tool,"How can you call this a 'Flush' Cutter when the cutting edges are offset? There was no such description for these or I would not have bought them. That is what happened to my real flush cutters. Someone borrowed them and squeezed so hard the blades became offset. So I needed to replace them. Offset cutting edges do NOT accomplish a FLUSH cut. I'll go back to my $5.00 WalMart specials. At least they cut flush when new. If you need a true flush cut, don't buy these."
4,very nice cutters but cutter heads not ground evenly,"I would be giving these 5 stars but upon inspection, the cutter heads are out of alignment. The last pair I had until someone stole them, were perfectly ground smooth. These flush faces are not flush, their is a little edge like they were ground separately then assembled. They do cut fairly clean, but I don't do work under a microscope, if I did I would probably have sent them back to get a replacement set and hope the quality control was better. I cut zip ties and plastic dash kits for clean car audio installation. For the price of shipping back and forth and time lost, I just decided to deal with it."
2,Wilson Pens Real Yawner,"This standard whodunit, set in the swamps of Louisiana, doesn't stack up to the author's previous work, ""Extinct."" This bare-bones plot with few surprises, gets lost in a lot of voodoo mumbo-jumbo, with its story populated by cartoonish zombies. Some real bad juju in this snoozer."
3,"buckweat zafu, zabuton and support cushion","I really like the buckweat zafu and support cushion, but the zabuton is not big enough. I wish I were given some dimensions on it before purchase. I would have purchased a larger one. My knees fall to the floor with this one."
3,"Good photographs, but inaccurate text...","There is some outstanding equine photography by some of the world's most renowed equine photographers in this book, but do not rely on the text and commentary as a source of fact. Many inaccuracies (perhaps something was lost in the translation from Italian to English), that the editors should have caught: pinto horses mistakenly referred to as Arabians, a photo of an (obvious) adult horse described as a ""foal"", Paint stock-type horses annoyingly referred to as ""pintos"", an obvious leopard-spot appaloosa whose pattern is described as ""marble.""Nice book to look at and browse through, though. Would make a nice gift for the young horselover who enjoys looking at horses."
3,Ideal for beginners only,"This book is great for someone who is starting out.However, I found that the book was lacking in variety of exercise for a person who already knows the basic weight training exercise.I found that the book did not go into much detail in all the chapters, it was more like a breif summary.I guarantee after 8 weeks you will be looking for another book that provides a variety of exercises so that you can alternate and stay motivated."
3,Too Convoluted an Ending,"Although it's fun getting there because of Cohen's wonderfully light style, ""Some Like It Hot-Buttered"" is a much better tale than this one because the resolution at the end makes a lot more sense. This one is so convoluted it's ridiculous. Kudos, though, for the witty way of relating the story. I'll probably try one of his others in this series on the strength of the style alone, but so far the stand alone novel is much better."
5,"Reader from West Orange, NJ","This isn't your same old mystery book. It provides wit and humor that you never see in this genre. As a person that has read all the books by Clancy, Ludlum, Paterson, etc. this ranks right up there. I'm anxiously waiting for the sequel."
5,Very cool idea.,I thought that this idea was a very good and cool one. It reminded me in some ways of trigun. I recommened to anyone who is a fan of animes.
4,70's musician's pop-rock,"To all of us fans of seventies melodic poprock in the style of Trickster/ E.L.O./ Boston etc. this is a gem that was missed by most of us and had only minor airplay in GB and Germany. ""Smile is Diamond"" alone is worth paying any import-price and it was high time this work was re-issued on cd. Great songwriting,juicy production,Eagles/Poco-like harmonies,wonder why they never hit the big time,it wasn't the lack of talent. If anyone has any idea on whatever happened to these musicians, I'd be very thankful if you dropped a line, Frank Rittmann"
3,"High Times, Low Value as Primary Grow Guide","Yes, there is a wealth of information in this growing guide, some of it state of the art; that is not the issue. It is a compilation of articles from past issues, and there is a lack of cohesiveness to the content that makes it a poor growing guide for beginners; there is also more contradiction betweeen authors than is helpful. The book is best suited for somewhat experienced growers, looking for esoteric tips to perfect their craft, while exploring a spectrum of diverse and newer ideas. In the later context, it has greater value. For the novice it is a supplimental text to be used in conjuction with any number of more teachable growing guides. Lastly, the book would have benefited from a good index, but it has no index at all."
4,Invaluable Tool for Self Health Care,I was raised by two pharmacists who told me that vitamins were garbage and natural medicines were a scam. Three years ago I was diagnosed with cancer. I voraciously read many books on caring for my immune system and natural medicine. I wish I had read Pat Sullivan's book first. He clearly and succinctly synthesizes volumes of material into a proactive self care handbook that any layman can understand. I now know what my father didn't: not all healing comes from the pharmacy.I strongly recommend Wellness Piece by Piece to anyone looking to put more life into their years!AG
3,Fondant,"Nearly ever cake in this book requires the use of fondant. So, if you like working with fondant, it's a good book. However, I bought it because it claims to use edible ingredients. Okay, yes fondant is edible, but I like using candy, cookies, etc in creative ways. Making everything out of fondant is boring and not very imaginitive to me, so I didn't like the book."
3,Chraming if slow,"oysher is charming. the movie moves very slowly, or it least it feels like it, and was obviously shot on the cheap. It's a very fine trasfer and the quality of the DVD is very high."
3,shower arm and flange,"Price was good,delivery was quick.My only problem with this item is the fact that it is made out of plastic.In it's defense it's the only one like it out there.All in all,another satisfying buying experience through Amazon again."
4,Great product for Blondes,"Great product for blondes. It adds shimmer, shine and texture to your hair. I've been using the product for several years and truly enjoy it."
1,Ni regalado,"Despues de una semana de uso el tv presento una falla y hasta la fecha ha sido imposible obtener el manual tecnico de sharp para proporcionarselo al tecnico, por cuanto solo se lo venden a los tecnicos autorizados.Aca en venezuela no existe un tecnico autorizado."
2,SOY and TOFU and a few other interesting recipes...,"My husband and I purchased this book for his father, as he had just had heart surgery, and we had seen Dr. Collins on Regis Live promoting his book. It sounded great and I thought this would be great for my father in law, as he loves to eat, and thought there would be great recipes for him. We were so motivated that We also purchased one for ourselves.If you love Soy and Tofu you have hit a gold mine...Well in our case, neither my husband and I, or my father in law happen to like either of these.Practically all the recipes need these ingredients. Except for a few ""creative"" ones. One of the being ""the carrot dog"". You just supplement a marinated carrot for a hot dog and place it on a hot dog bun!!!! YUK!!!In all due respect, Dr. Collins seems very dedicated to his patient's and if you are a Soy and Tofu lover, you will probally love these recipes and if not, don't buy it."
2,disappointed,"I heard great reviews about the book and am sorry to say that I'm disappointed. If you're ready to hunt for a lot of hard to find soy products and fat free products then this is the book for you. The salt content of the dishes we tried were extremely high given all of the ""instant"" ingredients used. I'm suprised a cardiologist could recommend some of these recipes. The heart may be protected by the low fat and cholesterol content but it would certainly be damaged by the high blood pressure from all of the salt."
4,Are you ready to totally chance your life,I had a heart attack years ago. It was no fun I'll say that for it. It is so difficult to eat properly so if you want to make it easier on yourself and you can follow simple instructions go for it..
2,Not for professional work,This icing spatula should only be used if you are making the wednesday night dessert for your home. If you want smooth flat icing for decorating stick with the stainless steel. Otherwise for average daily home desserts and stuff its okay. Definitely do not buy if you are left handed. Not as great a deal as some of my other buys.
3,No Good Deeds,I will try to read more of her only because it took me3 chapters to figure out who did what. Will never be a PD James.
4,A good read,"This book by Laura Lippman was a good read. It is one of the Tess Monaghan Novels but this is the first one that I have read. I would be willing to read more because the characters are well defined and the plot is interesting and novel, though at times a clittle complex to follow. Enjoyed it.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
4,I have a new fav author,"I love to find a new author with a character series that I can really enjoy and Laura Lippman goes into that list. Very entertainig book with interesting, somewhat eccentric, characters. A very good read"
5,Another Great Laura Lippman Novel...Onto the next!,Great continuation of the Tess Monaghan series with new revealing insights into secondary characters. Great as an audio book!
4,I still have to break them loose,"If i go in with a standard socket and break all the bolts loose, then change to this for the tight spaces, I can save some hassle on the bolts with long threads. speeds up repetitive jobs quite a bit, but don't expect it to be a mini ""impact"" ratchet. Works well and will last for a long time."
3,Newbies Beware,"I've been a DIY guy for a long time and I decided to go nuts and get an air ratchet for the first time. I guess there must be some sort of secret brotherhood of air tool users because, as G. Johnson said in his review, there ain't no instructions. There is a safety manual that is just that, a parts schematic and a Product Information booklet with 2 tiny pages in English. Now I'm sure that some of you are thinking ""Whadaya want? You push the button and it goes."" Yeah but, for instance, the lubrication instructions say:"" Disassemble gearing and lubricate components."" That's it, no elaboration. Maybe they don't want you to do that yourself? Is it completely lubricated and ready to go as shipped? I don't know. I saw someone wrote that they just dip the head in oil. Maybe I'll try that. And the thing doesn't come with a connector. Is that standard for air tools? Can't use it without one. Again, I just don't know. This will hopefully be a great tool but newbies beware."
4,Ok just not great,"Contains live performances of some of Cuba's finest musicians. The Salsa flavor is apparent in every aspect of this slice of Havana, which includes interviews, in-the-studio footage, a virtual tour of the city, and Salsa dance lessons. Showcased artists include Bamboleo, La Barriada, Klimax, Chika Del Son, Angel Bonne, Arte Mixto, and more.This was a zero cost production DVD. The video & audio do not always match. It was no a worry for me but for some nit pickers they have given bad reviews becouse of this. The video's are good & the music makes me want to dance so I like it.The Salsa lesson is by an average Rueda dancer. I was not impressed."
3,This isn't really a book.,It is merely an extended chronology. Do not buy it unless that is what you are looking for.
2,For 'Conspiracy Nuts' Only,"As one reviewer pointed out, this isn't really a book. It is presented as a chronology with excerpts from newspaper articles, books, etc. that show the history of the globalist movement.The typical people are on the scene, international bankers, the Round Table people or 'the Group', Skull and Bonesmen, the Council on Foreign Relations, with the numerous quotes from Tragedy and Hope.The methods behind the New World Order aren't clearly spelled out, so other books would be much better to get. However, a self-confessed conspiracy nut could find some interesting leads for research. For example, apparently the Washington Post ran an article on Carrol Quigley shortly before his death entitled, ""The professor who knew too much."" I was unaware of this and would like to obtain a copy.If you are willing to pay the price to get a handful of items like that, get the book, otherwise read a book by Antony Sutton or Carrol Quigley."
5,Very cool stuff!,"This is a great video for just about anyone! The exercises begin with very basic body placement which is reinforced thruout the tape, and progress step by step thru movements we've seen performed by our favorite dancers. Stephanie Herman emphasizes proper placement & awareness of center & isolation in a way that's easy even for someone who's never danced before to follow. I keep going back to this video again & again both for myself & for my clients."
2,Liked part of it but hated alot of it,"I got this book because its one of the few that have my fav charecter in it, Darth Vader. Yet even with The lord of the sith himself could not save this book. There are some new charecters but they are just sad. Like Xizor, please no one in there right mind would even think of making Vader angry. Xizor is a charecter that everyone just wants to kill. (like jar jar binks) Yet he gets away without even being killed by Luke or Vader...just sad. I mean if Luke had not of slunk back into a farm boy and if leia didn't almost have sex with Xizor then maybe this book would of been at least three stars. this book is not a good buy and I hope one day that a writer will write a great book with Darth Vader in it. I also think its sad that it has not been done yet."
5,The attempt to rescue Han Solo from Boba Fett.,"Dash Rendar is supposed to protect Luke from the Bounty Hunters. It is a fast moving story. The story begins at the Battle of Hoth, then progresses to the planet Tatoine to save Luke from Swoops.Next you go to the sewers to get into Xizor's (she-zor) palace to rescue Leia. The Rebels blow up Xizor's skyhook and Dash crashes with a fiery death into the wreckage."
5,One of the best movies i see about german culture&politics in a long time...,"Following the catastrophe in Atlantis all nations were dispersed. A part of the Atlantean brotherhood's secret knowledge survived in Egypt, in India and in Tibet.The heirs of these secret brotherhoods led mankind during the dark age... throug Atlantean knowledge and through all ages.In modern times the Freemasons, Templers and Illuminati brotherhoods were formed.After World War I the Neutemplerorden and Thulesociety emerged in Munich and Vienna. New occult sects which saw 'satan' in the old Freemason lodges. With Hitler these occult sects came to power.This thrilling documentation shows for the first time the background of the Third Reich and its intellect which led to the catastrophy of World War II...Interviews: Wladimir Tarzisky, Prof. Hurtak, Virgil Armstrong, Wendell Stevens etc.approx. 84 Minutes"
3,CARDINAL COOKIE JAR,I was a little disappointed with this cookie jar. It IS nice and big but too much unusable space in the top and would have liked the Mama bird not so yellow. Still a nice and colorful cookie jar - works fine.
5,Razor-Sharp Wit!,"I love so much the being of this book! It's the only thing I have in my bathroom (besides toilet paper). You can turn to any page and find some hysterical line and clever take. The self-help section keeps growing,and Self-Helpless is the antidote!"
1,How Corny,"Wow- there are alot of silly self-help books out there and here's our spoofs thereon.That's the premise of this book. Brilliant, right? It probably took, what, a couple nights over drinks to put this together? One can imagine Bines et al. sitting around an East Village bar, yukking it up as they come up with faux titles like ""I'm O.J., You're O.J.""Had this book come out, oh, a decade ago, it might have scored points for being timely. But in 1999?"
1,Too bad you can't negative star this.,"I have blown $30 on many things, but this is one of the few things that I truly believe I would have gotten more satisfaction by burning the money with a match. To make this video a bunch of kids took their mom's camcorder and went out to oogle some ferraris on the roads of LA."
2,Diasppointing. Left me wanting.,"The potential for this DVD is never met. It's basically a hand-held camcorder-shot documentary. The disc comes off as more of a home movie than a true thrill ride. Although the cars are beautiful, and enthusiasts will enjoy the selections, the shooting is amateurish and poorly lit. For the most part the creators are just following alongside of the cars as they pass by over and over again. The chapter on the restorations is the only saving grace of the film. It is genuinely interesting. I am frankly surprised that Ferrari licensed this product. It's not the worst 60 minutes I've ever spent but I wanted so much more."
1,Not a Ferrari Experience,"A couple of highlights but mostly lows. It could have been savedsomewhat if they would have had the good sense to RECORD the sound of the engines, but you are treated to their choice music as they follow and have varius Ferraris approach the camera vehicle. They waste the Willow Springs segment without 'in car' at this venue. My wife had just 2 questions after watching thisDVD. 1 Why did you buy this? 2 Can you get your money back?"
1,A $30 beer coaster,"You can see better stuff on Youtube and it's better quality. The joke's on me I guess. Like others said, it's a guy with a hand held camcorder bouncing around in a car complete with wind noise. Save your money."
1,Embarrassingly Bad,"Wow. This might be the worst DVD I have ever seen. It's nothing more than a couple of kids running around with a shoulder mounted camera, ogling Ferraris. The footage is abominable and consists mostly of the cameraman hanging out of a convertible BMW while a Ferrari drives past him, then slows down and drives past him again. And again. And again. It's edited with amateurish transitions that would make your mom's birthday video look professional, and there are exclamations like: ""Damn!"" and ""That's one bad-a** car!"" The occasional voice overs are truly hilarious, with dramatic (and usually incorrect) comments such as: ""The F40 is the world's first street-legal Formula One car."" Whaaaaa?!! I actually felt bad for the one or two legitimate experts they ""interview"" because those guys are left valiantly trying to look professional and serious in what ultimately comes off like a glorified You Tube video shot by high schoolers. DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO. Trust me."
2,"Works, if you can get your dog to take it","We have had our English shepherd mix on this for several months, and we have seen improvement in her mobility, but getting her to take the pills is the problem. I'm assuming the flavor must not be appealing, because we have always had to bribe her by spreading peanut butter on the tablets, and lately, even with the PB she refuses them. We're going to try the BF Joint Max."
4,Shannon Tweed does it again.,"Normally, I disliked Shannon Tweed because they are cheap and the plot is normally just about sex. My perspective of her was turned around when I watched Naked Lies and this one. This one relied more on suspense and mystery then sex and nudity.She stars as a murderous and deceitful woman who marries a wealthy man to get his money. His stepdaughter has suspicions about her. After he dies of a fatal heart attack, she finds out what she is really up to. That is where the suspense and murder come in. Yes, this movie may contain some strong sexuality, but it was not as sexually charged as some of her other ridiculous films.Once again, this is one of her best. I recommend this to anyone who would like to see a good Shannon Tweed suspense film."
3,Attractive reliable cast in entertaining film.,"Shannon Tweed, attractive and talented as always, plays a cold-hearted femme fatale in a fairly good film with plenty of plot twists. The supporting cast are also quite interesting and do a first rate job. Only quibble, several nasty violent scenes which could have been avoided."
4,power play,I liked this movie. I t has everything except MORE of Mrs tweed. She was up staged by female costar. THe sex scenes were above average. beter then most softporn.anyone who did`nt like should just watch porn !! Better then NC17 the DREAMERS. Kind of ended like WILD THINGS.
2,Not good,"Basically, the quality of this DVD is not good and Shannon Tween didn't perform very well in this film. Although other girls show the nudity and sex scene, it does not help too much for this poor movie."
3,Power Play NC-17 Version,"I thought the plot was pretty lame for the most part. Would've been nice to see Shannon Tweed in some steamy love scenes, but it was the same old same old sex scenes with her. I would agree with other reviewer's that Daniel Ciardi stole the spotlight. The ""Quickie Sex Scene"" on the kitchen stove with her boyfriend and the Hotel Room ""Romp"" were the highlights for me. Very good sex scenes for an NC-17 movie. Besides that it barely gets an average rating from me."
2,Shannon Less Action,Other than a scene at the front end of the movie this is NOT a Shannon Tweed film. More time is spent with other characters who are AFTER Shannon. Shannon's scenes are boring and she seems to be walking through for most of the movie. Shame she is still a beauty at over 40 but disappoints in this one. Decent movie though.
1,"Shannon Tweed Paycheck #1,423","One weird movie. It feels like a film-school final project, with the generic crime story ripped from countless Tarantino-esque indies, mixed with some fairly explicit sex. What I don't get is why Shannon Tweed is even in it. The lovely Ms. Tweed is a genuinely interesting actress whose skills have developed over the past two decades. Granted, she's grown while usually in DTV..., but the woman has the skills to be a lot more than just another body. She's done TV and theatrical films, showing promise and talent without exposing acres of flesh, so why in the world did she agree to this script, to work with a raft of unknowns who can't act and get more action than she does. My guess is that she was probably getting a decent paycheck out of this movie, and work's work, after all. That's too bad, because she deserves better than this."
2,Meh...,"Gene Roddenberry, awesome imagination, not so awesome writer. The story was good, with some changes from the actual movie (as expected) but the writing was awful. His choice of words were, are times questionable."
3,A Novelization,"I haven't seen the movie in about fifteen years, but this book is adequate. That's about all I can say about that."
2,The Motion Picture Comes Up Short,"Hello everyone,Don't get me wrong... Gene Roddenberry is a great guy and I think we're all very greatful to him for creating Star Trek. My belief is that this book came up extremely short of the standard of Star Trek novels, and novelizations especially. Granted, this book was written almost 25 years ago, but still, it was not all that good.Admiral Lori Ciani, Kirk's wife? Where did this come from? It comes out of thin air. Nobody knows anything about this woman. And apparently they were ""married"" during Kirk's stint on Earth. Not a necessary part of the book.In my opinion, this could have been a lot better."
3,The New Adventures Begin here.,"The five year mission has ended, the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise has moved on to other assignments and been promoted. Life has moved on. Then, from the depths of space, comes a huge cloud with incredibly destructive powers, and it is on a course for Earth. Once again James T. Kirk, now an Admiral, must lead the U.S.S. Enterprise on an incredible adventure.This novelization of the plodding movie that detractors call Star Trek - The Motionless Picture was ghostwritten for Roddenberry by Alan Dean Foster, the man who penned the unoriginal concept story the script was based on. Although little more than the script in narrative form, Foster gives the tale a sense of urgency and tension that the film sorely lacked. It also reads better than it plays. Still it's strictly for Trek buffs."
5,It looks great.,This looks great in my new bathroom. The quality appears to be great also. I really hope this proves to be good.
2,Not wonderful,The seat is a bit small for our commode. It is not bad looking but is somewhat transparent. I will probably keep looking for one I like better.
3,Attractive but Expensive for the Low Build Quality,"I'm pretty much repeating what many other have said, but it bears repeating. This really is a nice looking toilet seat. Unfortunately, it is poorly built. The hinges just don't hold up.In the past I've replaced the broken ones, but that was when I could find them locally at about half the price it's listed for here on Amazon. I just can't see rewarding poor workmanship by paying an exorbitant price. If I could find one for a reasonable price, I'd buy it, because it goes well with my decor."
1,"Had two, hinges broke on both.","This is a cute, aesthetically pleasing toilet seat, but I've had two of them and on both the hinges that attach the lid to the seat broke after about a year. The metal area of the hinges is narrow, with a screw going through the center of them, so there's not much metal left for structural support. I'd like to buy a third, but I won't because I now know it won't last. I bought both of mine from a big box store, not from Amazon."
2,eh.,"wouldn't recommend this particular seat - our hardware broke and the seat itself makes things look perpetually a little discolored. i've had novelty seats before, and this one just didn't do it. decided to go with a toilet tattoo!!"
5,toilet seat -silver leaf - clear,"i had this identical toilet seat for years and my finance broke it by accident. the local shop where i purchased it no longer had the same item. i then decided to look on line for another similarly attractive seat. i came upon the exact same one at amazon and immediately ordered it. it was shipped immediately and delivered in 2 days, much to my surprise.the seat is just as beautiful and fabulous as the original and less money also!!!! i got my finance a chair for the toilet so he doesn't have to sit on the seat cover while attending to his toiletry needs. he installed it also in no time flat and i feel as if i never lost the last one - identical item.this is not a fragile seat but since my finance is 6 feet 4 inches and heavy, it is understable how the seat cover cracked. i hope my new one lasts another 10 years or more!!! i love it!!! so original and chic."
4,Bathroom accessories,"Very pleased with appearance and functionality of this product.Adds some sparkle to the bathroom.Co-ordinates well with the white and silver decor, and compliments all other accessories."
1,Don't buy!,I am very disappointed in this product!The metal rusts! I wrotea review on this and contacted the company. Noone responded to me!
1,We don't care for this...,This toilet seat dents very easily--within 2 days of installing it was damaged. If I had saved the box I would have returned it!
4,toilet seat,"nice, durable, only 1 problem after awhile the hinges rust, I had one prior to this one."
3,I've seen better toilet seats,"I ordered this model because water pressure isn't great here and I don't like surprises, I wouldn't get it if your bathroom is sunny as sun discoloration is an issue. Hardware feels cheap as well."
2,Capice Toilet Seat - Shell Design Missing on Seat,"I received my Capice Toilet Seat order on Friday, February 24th. My excitement quickly turned to DISSAPOINTMENT !!! The shell design is very clear on the top cover, but the seat itself is clear plastic with no hint of a shell design. Is Amazon selling the defects that did not make the production cut? I currently have two seats that I purchased over 7 years ago at Bed Bath & Beyond in my master bath and powder room and have received continous compliments on them. I am hoping to return the item, but the box was torn taking it out, which happens to be the same manufacturer box as my store purchases. Soooo dissapointed. :~{"
2,nice looking shoe poor workmanship.,"After wearing the shoes about 6 times, the heel on the right shoe became unglued from the shoe itself. Very dissapointing as I now have to pay to get the shoe repaired!!"
1,Bad quality,"I bought this shoe because of the great deal that Amazon had for it. I felt safe because this is a Kenneth Cole brand.Wrong!After 5 weeks of use (not even full time), the sole completely ripped from the main part of the shoe when pulling it off. Granted, I was using the toe of one shoe to pin the heel of the other to slide it off, which is not proper etiquette, but these shoes should be able to withstain much more stress than that. I have never had that problem with other shoes.This is my second complaint with Kenneth Cole shoes. The other pair that I had wore prematurely on the sole.If you decide to get these, treat them with kid gloves."
2,Unlisted Men's Hudson Oxford,I bought this shoe a couple of months ago and it is air tight. The shoe doesnt let your feet breathe. I have only worn it twice and will not wear it againg.
2,Comfy but Poor Quality,"I've worn these shoes for two months. They look nice and are comfortable, but the soles are already wearing down. Recentlt the heals on both shoes detached from the shoe. The soles seemed to be glued on rather than sewn on. At first I was impressed with these shoes, but they fell apart in less than two months of regular wear."
3,Great Looks mediocre quality,After about 40 days of use I had finally gotten the upper broken in and to my surprise the sole falls off the shoe when I get home from work.It sounds like Kenneth Cole will replace it if Amazon can't do anything but KC is stating a 7 week turnaround!
5,Nice quality with decent design.,"You can see this design everywhere, pretty common. But the quality makes it outstanding.The comfortableness is good. But I did feel tired sometimes when I wear it for long. Maybe just the day my feet were tired.Very good looking, easy to match different style of casual clothing."
1,"NOT a good product - Unlisted Men's Hudson Oxford,Black,11.5 M","I am using the shoe now, but the sole (the bottom part of the shoe) is not glued properly with the shoe. When I was removing the shoe, when the laces were little tight, the bottom sole came out (I have NEVER experienced this with any other brands which I have used for last 10 + years)I wish I could return it, but dont have TIME to chase"
3,"Good on features, not so good on fit.","It was on sale, so I bought one and figured I can use it with jeans and as an all around casual shoes. The edges are hard and the fit is a bit too tight. Maybe the leather was dried too much or not oiled enough. I would have given this 5 stars, but the comfort level of wearing this made it a little less desirable shoe."
5,Cosmic Blues Rocks!!!,"This CD really rocks!!! Many of the artist on this CD are talented but obscure artist. It took a foreign company to appreciate the artistry of these fine musicians. Jazz/Funk guitarist Eddie Fisher with his toe tappin', booty shakin' ""Cosmic Blues"" is sure to get the adrenaline flowin'. Originally released independently under his own label Nentu in 1976 and a year later by Sugarhill's Stang label. Even after 27 years ""Cosmic Blues"" still sounds fresh. Brother To Brother were initially studio musicians for the All Platinum Label. Brother To Brother's cover of the Gil Scott Heron classic ""In The Bottle"" gives the original a run for its money!!!! True fans of funk won't be disappointed. I'm surprised I haven't heard these tunes sampled by todays hiphop artists. In time I'm sure!"
5,I like it,"Got one of these - it's a True Temper, pretty sure it was the exact same one - for much less at Home Depot. It's nice. It doesn't have the jaunty feel of a fully pumped rubber tire, instead feeling like a slightly flat version of it. But... if you have a tire that you get sick and tired of filling all the time, then this is your solution. As someone else said, you can buy a pretty nice wheelbarrow with a poly container, metal handles, and a flat-free tire on it for $60-$70. Think it was at Lowes that I saw it."
1,This is not a universal tire - didn't fit my wheelbarrow,"I was unable to try out this wheelbarrow tire because it didn't fit my Ames wheelbarrow, although the product description said it was universal. Later it occured to me that the description didn't include any diameter measurement (only the hub measurement), so I checked the tire and found that it is 15"" across. My old tire measured 13"", so there's the problem. If the product description had included the measurement, I would have known not to order it."
1,Rip-off,"At Home Depot or Menard(Chicagoland), the whole wheelbarrow with flat free tire can be purchased at $60 to $70, so, this is absolutely waste of money."
2,Flat-Free but Faulty,"After only 18 months, my tire came off the wheel, spilling sealant all over. Stores don't sell the tire separately. After all, it's GUARANTEED."
2,"Needed More Harry, Less Interviews","I grew up watching Harry first broadcast the White Sox games and even would watch him broadcast for that minor league baseball team, the Cubs. I wanted to get a DVD of Harry, so I bought this one. I like the DVD, but don't love it. I was hoping to see more clips of Harry calling games and less of the interviews of people that knew Harry, which makes up half the DVD. I would have been happy with a DVD of an actual game Harry called, but I will settle for what I have!"
5,Interesting mix of psychology and investing,"As a die hard Index fund fan, I would disagree with the author's book title that it is possible to beat the Index year after year. However, the author's unusual mix of Myers-Brigg people type categorization plus investing was an interesting read. I gained the most from this book from the author's thoughts and stories about the creative thinking process more than anything else. Enjoyable book to read, but not sure his techniques can be practically applied by an investor."
5,Very useful for those who are repairing or restoring a VW of those years,"The book features multiple photos and detailed descriptions of the differences in exterior and interior design, equipment and details between the different years over the period 1949-1959, especially useful for those who have a Split, an Oval, or the first generation of Square rear window VW, and wish to perform a repair or restoration to strictly genuine patterns."
2,Shamanic Journeying,"I wasn't all that impressed with the CD. It might work for some, but it was kind of distracting to me."
4,Millions of Cats,I knew the title but was not familiar with the story. It is a charming little book that a friend made reference to. It shows it's age but don't we all.
5,Great Cheat Sheet,"This two-sided laminated cheat sheet includes all the information needed to make adjustments/changes on the fly. Its small size (Tri-folded 8 1/2 x 11 sheet) easily fit into my camera bag. With all the information provided, print size is small but clearly legible and includes everything important from the manual."
2,Storyline too confusing,Cynthia meets Ron who works in the Forest Service and she can't make up her mine whether to be with him or go home and work in her mom's audio business. It is a short read and the storylines are dang confusing!
2,Story way too unrealistic,I found this story way too unrealistic. Part of the problem was the build up to the end where the author has you thinking that it is either Jeff or Tim involved in the drug situation. Too me it would have been far more interesting to have either of these guys involved. Plus the fact that Cynthia had two christian perfect guys after her made the whole story that much more unrealistic to me.
1,Ho Hum.....,i don't know why but somehow this book put me to sleep. I don't know if the characters are too dull or the plot weak but there wasn't enough spark and excitement in this book plus it is one of the longer Springsong books.
5,Girlfriend loved this,"I got this for the girlfriend for Christmas. She has been wearing for years. This was a good source and decent discount price.She said ""Light and not overpowering. Not too flowery or powdery, yet still feminine."""
2,Caution: Paperback edition is Student Study Guide!,"Watch out: the ""paperback edition"" is not the textbook itself,it is a Student Study Guide. You may want both, but don'tbuy the study guide under the impression you are getting thebook itself."
4,theory is middle but problm is fantastic!!!,this book is adequate to CFA exam. the theory is a little bit vague but the problem is good to CFA OR CMA exam
3,"Good workout, poor videography","I was really excited when this video arrived in my mailbox. I ripped off the plastic, shrugged into my leg warmers, and stuck it in my VCR...And I was rather disappointed.The workout itself is really good. Don't get me wrong; it's challenging, and if you maintain good form & practice regularly, it WILL help you get those long, lean ballarina legs.But, the quality of the video is so bad that I have trouble watching it. It's so bad that it's distracting. Stephanie stands in a ballet studio in front of a corner. There are mirrors on the walls, and a big, ugly drop-cloth behind her. In the mirrors, you can occasionally see the stage-hands or cameramen moving around. The music (classical ballet music) sounds like it came from a home CD player.If you don't mind following a really poorly-shot workout video, then go ahead and try this. If you tend to be distracted by such things, you might want to try The New York City Ballet workout."
3,Lutherans don't go far enough,"I think this book represents a good start, (I really do!!!) but lutherans have a long way to go in missional thinking and praxis. I beginning to understand that the theological categories, maybe especially for the Lutherans, represent language barriers that hinders us in communicating the content of our case adequately, even to young lutherans in a postmodern world. That is a challange! But this challange is not an underlying principal in this book, and therefor it might just end up regaining evangelizing living in a context that's no longer here, even if this is a good shot."
2,Not a fan.,I love the buns of steel series. I work out to them 5 days a week! However I was very disappointed with this video. It is the same format as the original but without the step. She even messes up a few times and is hard to follow. My suggestion is buy the advanced and just do it without the step. Then when you are ready to add a step you can. With this video once you master the basics it's tough to bump it up a level.
2,stick with a newer series,"I purchased this video because I used it in the nineties and found it very effective, and I like Tamilee Webb. However now it seems very slow and dull compared to more recent work out videos. Tamilee uses the same moves but updated, and the workouts seem to go quicker in her newer videos. Stick with a newer workout! It's boring.The Science of Fitness with Tamilee - I Want That Body!"
3,buns of steel 3,"I found that this tape does not concentrate on the buttocks very much. It's more of an ""all body"" work out. There are a lot of lunges in the beginning. Be careful if you have weak knees or you could easily injure them. I think Buns of Steel 1 is a better work out. I do like Tamilee's Abs of Steel."
1,where is it?,"I ordered this on 23 March, it is now 23 April and still haven't received it...can't review it if I don't have it."
5,Hurts so good,"I love this tape. Tamilee is one of my favorite instructors. In this tape there are plenty of lunges and squats--with my favorite and most effective exercise,(besides reverse lunges) the one-legged squat. What I truly like about this tape is that at the end of the workout she demonstrates how to increase resistance with the use of rubber bands and weights. Get this tape and be ready for one workout of a lifetime."
2,For beginners only,"If you don't know anything about what is a disassembler or a debugger, then you may find this book interesting. Personally, i bought it because i thought it would go in deep in IDA and softice. Unfortunately, the author cover both of those tools within 100 pages giving nothing more than a summary of commands. All the remaining content is about assembly (that is if you don't understand anything in the intel reference books), the PE format (studying PEDump and reading Matt Pietrek article would be better), some little cracking sessions (the free articles on the net are far enough for this purpose), some other tools like W32dasm and disassembling some sample windows programs.Well, i am disappointed and still waiting for a good reference book about reverse engineering."
5,Powerful!!!!,"This is the best Amon Amarth work, the music and the lyrics make you feel in the north ancient times. All this work is pefect."
4,Melodic Viking Metal,"I saw Amon Amarth open up for Children of bodom a few months ago. I had heard of them but never listened. Walking into the concert hall and seeing this long haired, long bearded, scandinavian motherf*cker with a horn/flagon full of beer strapped around his waist proved quite an entertaining image. Then my ears perked as I noticed the guitars spewing forth a wall of melodic and layered riffing that made the inner warrior in me yearn to pick up a sword and traverse 1000 miles of salty, stormy sea water only to besiege a village of christian settlers, beheading them all. And thats not a bad start. :)Long story short if you like the melodic, no keyboards side of scandinavian viking inspired metal, this is about as good as it gets. If Unleashed were playing melodic swedish death/black metal, this is what it would sound like.Amon Amarth put on a really good live show, which is rare for metal bands in my opinion."
4,These guys are all the Viking death youll ever need.,"Sorrow, Once sent, Avenger, Crusher, Vs. the world, NOW THIS!!!!!They never disappoint. This album flows from one track to the other and is not as fast as any of the other albums but its still great. Fate of Norns if close to being my Fav. AA song, but thats held by VICTORIOUS MARCH. Buy it , love it , pillage, destroy, and then drink some MEAD. These guys are the best in the real death scene. Suffocation, Cannibal, Deicide , all suck.Only AMON , DEATH , and DECAPITATATED ar worthy of ebing death metal bands."
5,If you thought Vs. The World was great. . . .,"I eagerly awaited this one to come out. I had only started getting into Amon Amrth when I first heard ""Death In Fire"" off Vs. The World. That CD is great. I feel this one is a little more melodic but still great and has their Viking feel to it. This CD is very listenable from Ancient Signs to Once Sealed with my favorites being The Fate Of Norns and Pursuit Of Vikings. I cannot get enough of this disc!"
4,Weissberg133,This product is great and is well worth the price. If youre thinking about buying this product make sure the amount of space will work for you since the space is limited.
3,great kid book,This was a great book to read to early learners. I used this book computer teacher for grades K-3 and they all just loved it.Wish there were more just like it.
4,Computer Disaster a Book sensation,"This book is a great book for many reasons. One reason is that it is a book that any kid could enjoy. This book has the idea of truth and it is a great book with descriptive words. The book has wonderful art and a great story line. It earns 4 stars in my head, and 5 or above in a small kid's head. It is about Arthur (the lead chracter) who thinks he breaks the computer but doesn't. It is a great book for all ages. :)"
4,Give them this book!,"If you're sending a kid off to college, send them with this book. It demystifies the grading process as well as the professor. I wish I'd had it when I went to college, because I spent a long time trying to figure out what a professor wanted, how they graded, and why my grades fluctuated so much. I've gone back to college and I'm still reading parts of this as I write papers or prepare discussion questions.From the author of:Bad Girls Club"
3,Professors'Guide to getting Good Grades In College,"Sorry, I bought this for my grandson to read and don't know if it is helping him or not..."
4,On Broadway with Motian,"Paul Motian brings together an amazing cast and leads them through some great old tunes. Hearing Bill Frisell (guitar) with Lee Konitz (alto) and Joe Lovano (usually tenor) is an interesting and astounding combination of unique stylists. A personal highlight for me is ""How Deep is the Ocean""? An excellent album, I highly recommend it for any fans of Frisell, it is a very interesting context to hear him in."
3,Get what you pay for,Fit was fine .. quality not quite as good as OEM. Mirror seems to vibrate more than OEM on other side.
2,sea monkeys,one hatched the locket was leaky and they are kind of boring dont waste your money get a lizard but most of the time this happens in the north and this is not instant it took 3 weeks to hatch the video game is also better
1,Not as Pictured,NOT AS PICTURED- the packaging is totally different and even the spray looks strange...a poor imitation of Feliway!
1,don't fake it say it with love,I have not recieved it yet. I have e-mailed the supplier with no response from them.
5,Great product,"I used the balm every night on my belly and no stretch marks with both my pregnancies. It can feel a little greasy, but it does have a nice suttle smell."
3,Nice but flawed,The pitcher Its self is very nice heavy except for one flaw.The handle has a pronounced ridge from the mold.Prolonged use by a server would quickly become uncomfortable.For occasional use it is tolerable but I will not buy a second.I have some Anchor Hocking beer mugs that have that same flaw.A ridge caused by mold flash in the manufacturing and poor quality control.The Libbey glassware I have seems to be better quality.I have some old hand me down Anchor Hocking glassware that was my mothers and my grand mothers it was much better quality.
5,¡Excelente!,Esta es una verdadera joya del jazz. Muy variada y de muy alta calidad todos los temas. Este músico es un verdadero genio de la música.
4,Protein Review,"Good consistency, taste tho I would prefer lessof the little bits of coconut! Creamy chocolate with no aftertaste."
3,Avoid the Kindle version of this book,"The content is good, but the Kindle version of this book is horrible. The table of contents doesn't actually link to a specific page so there is no way to easily get to a particular chapter. Unless you just want to read it from beginning to end, this makes this book almost useless as a reference."
3,"Somewhat helpful, but definitive","The book is fairly helpful, and did bring to light a few new ways of thinking about interwoven. However, many of the examples seem to be incomplete and only scratch the surface, leaving the reader needing/wanting more information."
3,Where was her editor?,"While I liked the concept as well as the storytelling, I was frequently distracted by the mistakes. There were so many missing words, incorrect tenses, etc., that I'm wondering if anyone actually edited this book before printing. Very aggravating."
5,Great read!,"I got this book two days after it came out and finished it in a little over a day! I loved it. Great, fun read! It's a story that is very easy to relate to in many ways! :)"
5,Loved it,What a fun read! I couldn't put it down. It was a bit predictable but the journey was so fun. I'm looking forward to reading from this author.
5,buy this book,this book is so funny and well-written. couldnt put it down. and now it will be a movie. cant wait to see it.
5,Best Chick Lit I've Read In A Long Time - Couldn't Put Down!,"This book is hands down the best chick lit I've read in a while. It would make a PERFECT romantic comedy. I won't summerize the plot but this book made me think about my own ""List"" and wondering what those guys are up to. Delilah is hilarious, she is realistic, her relationships with her family are realistic, and there is no stupid wondering about ""Why don't they see THEY are really in love?"" when you know they will.For the person who was wondering why Colin falls for her: Maybe because she wasn't falling all over his feet as other girls did. Maybe because she was interesting and they got to become friends.The stuff about the dog Eva was hilarious and I could totally relate because I own a Yorkie and they are SOOOOOOO like THAT!Anyway read this book. You'll laugh out loud more than once."
4,Chick Lit at its Best!,"What's Your Number (previously published as 20 Times a Lady) is proof that ""Chick Lit"" is not dead! Karyn Bosnak, welcome to the world of books written for women that you just cannot put down! I actually missed a stop on public transit reading this book, and cannot tell you enough how entertaining it was. Bosnak even taught me a few new words, including ""foxymoron,"" a term for a man that is good-looking on the outside, but not so bright otherwise. In this book our heroine Delilah Darling finds love in the most unlikely of places after taking a journey through her muddled past where every stop is wrought with hysterics and drama. This book has been adapted for a film, which I have not yet seen, but I'm looking for show times as we speak! I'm hoping that it can do the book justice!UPDATE: Skip the film. It doesn't do the book any justice."
3,"yes it's witty, but.....","I have to agree with most of the posts that the author is very witty and most of what she wrote was laugh out loud funny. The ending was predictable and it was irritating to see that the main character could be so dimwitted as to bother looking up her ""loser"" ex-boyfriends. Hadn't she heard the saying, never go back?This should have been a quick read, but what irritated me were all the editor errors. It really took away from the book and there were so many I wondered if the editor had something against the author. It wasn't just the occasional typo. There were added words, missing words and in some areas had to be read over.If you need some laughter in your life, then go ahead and borrow it from someone or go on the authors blog and try and win one for free."
1,Predictable and poorly written,"This book is awful. It pains me to say that because I adore Karyn. She is hilarious on her blog, so I really expected more from this book.The writing is poor. There are a few funny parts, but mostly it is just recycled humor from other books and fluffy dialogue. Also, the book has a ton of typos, which drives me crazy. Whoever proofread this book should be fired. The storyline is outlandish and the ending predictable.It is no surprise that this is being made into a movie because it is just the kind of thing that women today seem to love. I, for one, will not be wasting my money to see the movie. I am just glad I got the book from the library and didn't spend money buying it."
3,"Overall amusing, yet a bit too over-the-top","I think that the weirdo-factor was a little much in this novel (but OK, it IS a work of fiction), but generally I was entertained. It was pretty predictable at the end (and a bit cliché). The thing that really bothered me was the amount of mistakes! It's like every time I'd get on a roll, there'd be a glaring typo or misuse of a word. Not only did it seem like no one edited the book; it seemed like it wasn't even run through spellcheck!"
2,Once Is Plenty,"Bosnak has a wonderful writing style but this story was deeply iritating and as morally bizarre as her non-ficititon nod to personal debt. Her solution in that one? Hit up strangers on the internet when you need a buck. Her solution In ""Twenty Times"" when her character bangs 20 men (her personal limit)? Go back to each one of these pathetic losers and make one of the shoes fit. I got really bored and frustrated to see Bosnak waste her handsome talents on this rubbish. And this was a short book."
3,Good just to kill time...,This comedy-novel is a good chick-flick to spend dead time but suddenly I found it a little bit repetitive. Recommended for those as I that are not very avid readers and want to start catching up the lecture rythm.
4,"A funny, funny, did I say funny read!","Karyn has done it again, This book was hilarious, I didn't want it to end. The characters are so real, and the adventure Delilah goes on is just a riot. I highly recommend this to anyone who has a desire to just lose themselves for a few hours to the crazy world of Delilah Darling!"
5,So not boring!,This is the first chick lit novel written by Karyn Bosnak and I really hope it isn't her last. She has a written a tremendously funny laugh out loud book that I think anyone would enjoy.I really loved this book. I HIGHLY recommend that you read this.
1,mind jello,"Every once in a while I want to read something that allows me not to think at all, I like it better if its engaging and funny. While this did allow me not to think at all, it is in fact, stupid as hell. Written like a middle school girl (maybe that was the idea). This kind of crap can be well written, this wasn't. I like snarky, not dumb."
5,loved the book,I read a previous book by this author and loved it so I was hoping I would love this one too and I did.
4,Hilarious!,"It's kind of crazy start that the leading character Delilah first reveals how loose she is regarding her relationship with men because she had slept nineteen men in her life (of cource they were all her boyfriends). But she sounds serious and slightly embarrassed rather than proud about her sex life, and that is why I liked her. Searching for her true love by seeing them again, and I can see Delilah became more mature than the beginning. I want to try the movie, too."
2,mommav,My 5 year old loved this toy. He was the envy of his birthday party. Unfortunatley after 1 month it no longer goes in reverse. And the gear shift is having problems in the fast speed. He grew bored of the slow speed in 2 weeks so definately invest in on the one that goes 2 speeds. Get the extended warrranty!
3,Fun for Son but several problems...,"John Deere Gator w/ seat beltsMy son loves his Gator, but...it has developed a transmission problem, where the Gator will not go in reverse, and it will go forward in only one speed.I took the transmission (red handle) unit off and discovered what appears to be a design flaw - the end of the red shifter handle slips off of the control unit where the two meet.It is after the warranty period so I'll have to devise a fix. Also... had a rear fender which never stays affixed to the dump, and have had parts (such as the seat hold downs and other screws) fall off into the grass.My neighbor's Gator is having the same issues.A lot of money for a not-so-well-designed product."
1,The worst piece of crap I ever read!!!,This book is poorly written and is just trashy. I wish I could have the minutes of my life back that I used reading this piece of garbage. DON't Buy it.
4,Pogo characters and a Disney heroine lost on another planet.,"Sure, sure, the art and the storytelling are great as usual (even spellbounding at times), but I'm still not comfortable with the fact those Bone creatures were superimposed over well-known characters from an ancient comic strip, so that's why I still hate the series so much I no longer buy the books anymore and instead check them out at a local library.And the plot itself is nothing new, either; a pubescent young princess-disguised-as-a-human-mortal discovers her own magical powers to go on a perilous quest and save the world. It's been done a billion times before in countless Disney movies and many manga books for the girlie audience. So why the eternal fascination with budding females of the royal status? No wonder Di never got a moment's peace."
2,could use some work....,"I bought this game thinking it would be cool, but I could tell just by the opening video that the graphics would be mediocre. then as I went into my first training mission, the graphics were choppy and I there was a large amount of lag. the sad part about that is that my computer has an 800mhz processor and a voodoo 5 graphics card. all in all I like the idea, but spend your money on a better game like delta force 1 or delta force: land warrior."
3,Rainbow Six,"Rainbow Six is a first person stealth shooter from Red Strom Entertainment. Rainbow Six is the codename for a team of special force who deal in missions like hostage rescue. There is not much of a plot, It is mostly dealing with the terrorists in different places and situations. Before the game starts you need to pick your team member, chalk out a plan, select weapons and then go terrorists hunting. R6 gameplay is not like other fps games, One gun shot is fatal and can kill you, This make it very challenging and intresting. One shot kills also also makes R6 very hard and almost impossible to finish in the single player gameplay, It does not have a save game option either. The Multiplayer games are the best things in R6 and they are very challenging and a lot of fun. Rainbow six is bad as a single player game but very good as a multiplayer game."
5,Homeopathy is amazing,"This book is fantastic. I recommend it to any person who has a ADD/ADHD child. I truly possible to make your child better without Ritalin. I may take awhile because homeopathy seems so hard, but it works. As a engineer, I don't easily believe things like this, so when I saw homeopathy work I was amazed."
2,lifestyle counts more,"I had ADD. Ritalin is a terrible cure, but snake-oil might be worse. To anyone who is affected by these issues, I say look seriously at lifestyle: diet, sleep patters, and whether the bloody school work is interesting enough. Rather spend your time reading about these topics first. Your child may be on the same unbalanced diet as you, but have some biochemical quirk that robs him/her of the ability to deal with the imbalance."
1,Wrong Phone Number in Book,"There is a phone number in this book that is wrong. It is my son's cell phone number. The number starts 408-421-05**. (I don't want to put the whole thing online, for obvious reasons. It is for some homeopathic place recommended in the book. If the publisher and editor would PLEASE correct this, we'd have a bit more peace in our household, and wouldn't run over our alloted minutes on the cell phone bill.The book may or may not be great, but if one phone number in it is wrong, probably more are."
4,Biography of William B. Ide & the Bear flag Revolt,"There are several versions/editions/republications of Simeon Ide's publications about his brother WILLIAM B. IDE. William was a key player in the famous California Bear Flag Revolt of June/July 1846. Given the 1880s publication date listed this would appear to be one of the original publications.In the 1880s, Simeon was asked to prepare a biography of his brother and he did so. During the course of his efforts, he located a letter from William to California Legislator Wambough about the Bear Flag Revolt events and Simeon was able to incorporate this letter into his works. This was significant since William died an untiemly death in 1852. Simeon's biographies of his brother along with the Fred B. Rogers' William Brown Ide, Bear Flagger are the 2 most important biographical texts on William B. Ide. Simeon's works are a must-read for anyone interested in the California Bear Flag Revolt.William J. Trinkle----DirectorTHE BEAR FLAG MUSEUM"
1,very simplistic,"F. Bennet writes like a born again christian! The book is full of ""motherhood statements""...in the words of Basil Faulty, ""...special subject, stating the bleeding obvious...""!These are my first gut reactions to this book, I'm about half way through and constantly fighting the urge to throw it in the bin. I really expect more from someone with a P.hd. I expect thorough research into other experts in this area, I expect language that is moderate and balanced instead of repeated use of words such as ""calamity, disaster, etc"". I expect a reasoned approach. I have to say there is little evidence of any of this.I suspect that coming from a background in Business Administration, the Priesthood and Psychology leaves him poorly equipped to give a full analysis of this area, oh but I forgot, his wife was once a teacher! Leave it up to the experts Fred."
2,Review of Book,"This book is hard to read, if your an intellect like my teacher who recommendedit, then you will love it. I am a person who likes easy to read material."
5,WONDERFUL,"I have tried many recipes in this book and haven't prepared one yet that wasn't delicious. The Tomato Tart, stuffed filet of beef, honey cashew greenbeens...the list goes on! YUMMMMM"
5,Love it!!!,"My husband brought this back for me after he went on a business trip on the coast- I thought it was kind of random at the time, but then I started making some of the recipes in it. It is worth the price for this book for the corn crab bisque recipe alone. We eat it about every other week in winter. One of the things I love about it is that the recipes are slightly different than your average run of the mill southern cookbook, but not super hard either. Definitely recommend!!!"
4,peace,"Good book about how Jesus has come to give us peace. If you are not confident in your relationship with God, you will have fear. We are to let the peace of God rule in our hearts, not fear."
5,A Must-Have!,"For those looking for true peace and joy in their Christian life, this book is a must. James B. Richards has a way of wording profound things into a simple, easy to understand language. The true Gospel message comes alive in a way that is often not taught in mainstream Christian circles. I'm getting copies for my kids so they can have a reference of what God's love is really all about.This book is excellent for anyone calling themselves a believer, but I think it would also benefit many that have been hurt, condemned or even turned-off by ""religion."""
5,Excellent,This book was very easy to read. The chapters are not long. This book should be given to every new believer! A great book to have at your church's book store & would make an excellent gift.
5,Really good!!,Dr. Richards has a way of explaining the Gospel that will help a Christian see how much God loves us.I have had the book for about 2 years and have read it through twice. I am still continually re-reading parts of the book because it speaks to my spirit man. It is on my coffee table continually with in easy reach.
1,Music to fall asleep to,"Unfortunately I was driving when I found this out. This disc is mind numbingly tedious, and believe me, I am being kind. If you are interested in listening to inane police chatter just buy a scanner and rip the calls to disc for posterity yourself. Consider yourself warned, should you be so foolish as to buy this."
5,WINDOW CAT BENCH,CAT BENCH WORKED OUT WELL. WE HAVE A NARROW SILL SO WE WISH IT CAME WITH SPACERS AS THE BRACKETS DIDN'T REACH THE WALL BUT FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY WE WERE ABLE TO ADAPT IT. WOULD DEFINETLY RECOMMEND.
4,Cat's Meow!,"My cat loves this! I would recommend putting some additional velcro on if you go that route, as it did slip off a couple times, but I do have a very large cat too. Overall though a great thing for a cat, mine just sits in it hours every day."
4,Cats love it.,"I bought this product last year. And it is rarely empty. I have cats varying from 10 pounds to 17 pounds. I just used the adhesive tape to attach to window sill (as I rent and didn't think my landlord would appreciate the screw marks in a window sill. My cats love this. They have a perfect view of the neighborhood. It is soft to the touch and can hold their weight. Occasionally, the two will stand on it together."
3,I was expecting something a little more substantial,"I received the bed as promised but when i opened it , it didn't seem as sturdy as i was made to believe. Then i found out i had to screw it to the ledge and that wasn't something i wanted to do. I will try it out and revisit my review"
2,Comfy but poorly made,"This is a fine cat bed, but for the amount that I paid ($32.00 +), the braces that hold it up wouldn't hook into the built-in slots in the bed particularly for the braces. I had to get really clever and use twine and duct tape. So far it's holding up but I surely wouldn't recommend it until they fix this problem. Oh, and I got this because I have a behemoth of a kitten and this was advertised as being specially built for large cats. He's going to end up weighing about 22 pounds-he's half that size now-and I hope that this will still hold him."
3,"Nice Product, but ...","I purchased the K&H Kitty Sill Deluxe Bolster Cat Bed. I have to say that it arrived very quickly. It is very attractive and I am sure that my cat will love it, BUT, I could have waited one more day if that meant the item would have been packed and shipped properly. The item arrived in the manufacturer's box not inside of an Amazon.com box. There was simply a label on it stuck on the box. It wasn't taped shut and the flap of the box was open. The screws, velcro and instructions were missing. They probably fell out during shipping. Luckily, I have screws and velcro, but it really should have been shipped better. I do like it and it looks nice. Overall, I'm satisfied with the product; I just wish it was shipped better."
2,Mounting Cat Bed,"This bed was a good idea,but needs a creative way to better mount.The velcro definitly won't hold the bed and there's really not a way to use screws efficiently.I've put a small table under the bed and my two cats really enjoy viewing the outside.I'm a wood worker and could could not think of a reasonable way to modify the bed,but the cats enjoy the bed on top of the table so I'll keep it for them,even though it's against my better judgement.I don't recommend anyone to purchase this bed.This bed was an Amazon verified purchase."
5,Cat is happy!,"Purchased this as a replacement for a similar item. This item was easy to install and seems very nice. My cat took to it instantly and she can be picky. Probably would not work for a larger cat, mine is 12 pounds and it's just right for her."
3,great,Its great my cat loves it the only thing is the white bars tend to fall off but dosnt hurt anything or put the pets In danger
4,sturdy,This item is well constructed.The cover and edging are very attractive and the foam padding feels comfortable. However my cat will not use it. Our previous one had no frame underneath and was more like a hammock with no suppport between the two sides.This one has a sturdy frame and does not give. If you have a cat that is used to the first kind he may not want to adjust.
3,Instructions for installation are inadequate,"The cat perch is fine once you secure it properly on the window sill. The instructions lack the parts needed to install this on anything other than wood double hung windows. There are no pictorials, no hints, no nothing. A clever Handiman will figure it out... Hurricane windows and vinyl clad windows, or windows with blinds or plantation shutter will give you the biggest challenge. And even a simple thing like protection for the wall below the window, I.e. no hints what to do. The support brackets will rub up and down every time the cat jumps onto the perch and thereby wear a hole into the wall . A simple self-stick rubber pad mounted behind the contact point of the bracket would solve the problem. Bottom line- if you have too left thumbs or are not comfortable improvising to secure this perch onto the window... Don't buy it."
5,My cats love these!,"I have bought two so far and I am planning to buy a third! My three cats love these, one of which sits on one all day - every day!"
4,GREAT!!!,The cat bed looks great and its sturdy. The fabric thats used seems to collect alot of the cat hair so thats is simple to vacuum off and clean up and less hair laying around the house. I'd say its the perfect size for a normal sized cat. My cat likes to stretch his legs and he uses the leopard print rim as a pillow for his head.
2,Not sturdy,"The product looks like the picture and just as described, but does not hold onto the window well at all. I have a 10lb cat, which is not overweight for a cat, and she was on the seat when the product feel out of the window, it was not able to hold her weight. The adhesive however ruined my window from the ripping. Not satisfied with the product."
3,good,great my cat loves it but u should always nail it in velcro doent work for me my cat is 12 pounds
1,Don't waste your money,Don't waste your money - the bed was lumpy - There was absolutley no way this was going togo in my window and stay - I would not trust this to support any animal - The bracketscould not be attached. It's in the trash now. Not even worth my time to rebox it and sentit back.If I could give it no stars - I would
2,Needs better adhesive,Bought two of these window sitters.They will not stay up. Even the kitten cannot sit on it without it falling off the window. The company needs to figure a way to keep it on the window.
3,Yes...need a screwdriver,"My car loves it but I did have to screw it to the window sill. Also, the legs are plastic which I didn't know when I ordered it. And they kept falling off until I screwed the bed to the window sill which anchored them against the wall. I'd say for the price...I'm happy with it."
1,Plastic.. and strange,This item is kinda cheap.It is hard to get on a window sill.you'll need a deep window sill for this to work.
5,This perch is top notch!,"I was very impressed with the quality of this item when I opened the package!! Not only is it very attractive, but you can tell immediately that this is not a cheaply made piece. It is so easy to put together - just put the legs on, then the velcro and it's done. No tools needed. I can't wait for my baby, Sammy, to sit on it. I have 3 cats & Sammy tends to harass my other boy, Gino when I'm not around. So, whenever I go out, Sammy is closed in my bedroom. Gino & Chanel have a very large scratching post/seat in front of a window in the other bedroom where they can look out. Now Sammy can look out also & I won't feel so bad closing him in when I go out. I am SO happy I decided on this item!"
3,USE THE SCREWS,This is a very plush cat perch and my cats love it. I bought two. My main concern is that the bottom props do not work. They keep falling off so finally we just put them away. The plastic on the props is just no help at all. Amy suggestions would be great. When I bought the perches there was no mention of screwing them to the window sills. Since this is a summer cottage it didn't matter but in a finished house I would not like it. In fact I would have sent them both back.
3,Well built but...,This unit is well built assuming you follow instructions when installing the legs to the base. The Velcro option should not be used since the sun will heat up the adhesive causing the unit to come crashing down.
3,"Works well, after some adjustments","I purchased this kitty bed for my 18 lb cat. The product description states ""sturdy enough to hold the heaviest of cats."" However--this didn't work for my cat--it eventually loosened and fell off the window. (Note: it's only held on with adhesive tape. This, in my opinion, is neither sturdy nor safe.) In the end, I screwed this to the window sill (holes are present in frame once cover is removed). I really would have preferred NOT to do this, but my cat likes to look out the window and I didn't want to deprive him--nor did I want him up on tables near the windows as this is unsanitary. Now that I've secured the shelf to the window and placed some felt pads as ""shims"" between the legs and the wall, this is working well."
4,Good product.,"After reading reviews, I decided to purchase this product. I have 2 cats that I rescued (mom and kitten) that love to look out the window. They love this cat bed! I did turn the bolster around to in order to support them as they faced the window, and it works great this way. I highly recommend doing this to help keep them from possibly falling as they stretch out and roll around. I also used the screws to make sure it was secure for them. Velcro may have worked temporarily, but I didn't want to worry about it, so use the screws!"
5,Great sunning bed for cats!,I bought two of the beds. One for each of my two ginger toms. They love sunning themselves on them. A definite great purchase!
5,kitty approved,"This is the best kitty window seat I've seen and the price is lower than most. It is easy to install, good quality and I'm ordering a second one so my cats will stop fighting over it! I wish they made a human size one!"
3,maybe its my cat...?,"I really liked the idea of a window perch for my cat. This perch looks nice, and it is sturdy. I put it up on the windowsill in my home gym because sometimes the cat follows me in and I don't want him lying on the weights or the treadmill. I lured him up on the perch with treats and he did jump up and eat them. And then he jumped down. He very rarely uses the perch - only when I bribe him. To be fair, maybe the gym isn't the best place for a cat perch. There is a lot to see out the window but he isn't really interested when viewing from the gym."
3,Not very sturdy,"Fast shipping, visually looks very nice but my cat is reluctant to use it. When he sits on it the bed it makes creaking noises against the wall which scares him."
1,My cat hates it.,"I put this in the window but my cat hates it. I would have returned it but I went on vacation and forgot to send it back. It appears secure...but apparently not to my cat. She refuses to jump on it and, if I place her on it, she quickly jumps off. It doesn't feel as comfortable as it looks either. It has some kind of bubble wrap inside the cushion."
5,My cat loves it!,Was very easy to install. I didn't bother with the velcro because my cat weighs about 15 lbs. The legs popped on with a little extra effort but I know they aren't going anywhere. As soon as I had it installed I put him up there and I could tell he already liked it. He is sleeping on it now as I'm typing and he is using the bolster as a pillow.
2,Potential problems,"I did like to bed itself however, the legs which hold to bed onto the window sill would not stay attached to the bottom of the bed long enough to put it together. I tried several times and gave up. I did return it. I really wanted it to work out.and was sorry it did not."
4,easy install,This was a great purchase..Easy to install...the cats love it and even share and it arrived quickly.Loved by all.
1,Velcro wasn't strong enough!,"I got this product, very skeptical because I have a 15 lb cat, and a smaller 10 lb cat. As I read all the good reviews of other customers saying how it held their 15-20 lb cats , I figured I'd give it a try. My cats loved it for the first 5 or so days, then , just as I thought, it started falling! I do believe however, it MAY have to do with my window sills being so small, even though the product description says it would fit on any sill. I am going to try to use the screws it came with, hopefully my cats will not be too fearful to try to get on it again. (I also bought at the same time a K&H Kitty unheated Thermo-Kitty Sill Seat, hoping 1 would prove me wrong and just hold with the velcro, but about 2 days later, that one as well, on the floor.)"
2,"Well. That was an experience. Define ""snap"" please...","I just put the Deluxe Window Cat Seat together and it has about worn me out. It's easy, really. You ""snap"" the supports on the bottom of the seat and put it in the window. No problem. But the supports would not just 'snap' into place. They required me to take off the micro-fiber cushion, turn the thing over, and bang it has hard as I could SEVERAL times on the counter before they would even think about ""snapping"" into place. How many times did I turn the thing over only to have the supports fall right off? I don't know, but now the dang cat is so scared of the thing from all the noise and banging and cursing that he's traumatized to the point where I honestly don't see him wanting to use it. But other than that, now that everything is snapped together, it's nice-looking and well-built. Just make sure you ""snap"" those braces on with all the force you can muster."
4,"Great perch, but cheap materials","I just bought this window perch last week (arrived 11/9/11).Pros:-Comfy pad & washable fabric cover-Adjustable Legs (for diff. window sill widths)-""Bed"" size is pretty large - I have a large 16 lb, Domestic Cat with numerous Maine Coon attributes, but my cat can curl up on this just perfectly!Cons:-Plastic! The whole thing is made out of plastic, both legs and base-Only one way to mount the Perch - You have the option of using velcro, or screws to secure it, but the holes are placed in the base of the perch (under the bed, right on top of the actual window sill). This was a problem for me since I have a tiled window sill. But we managed to secure it with plenty of double sided sticky pads along with the velcro.This may not last forever for my large cat/tiled window sill, and I think next time around I'll try to find one with wooden legs that I can nail/screw in for more support. But as for now, it works, and my cat loves it!"
3,Cats love it- but the velcro didn't last,"We had this up in our bedroom window for the kitties, and they used it a lot- for about a month. Then the Velcro failed and it came crashing down. You have the option of either Velcro or screw attachment- so I would go with the screws. I have yet to take the time to put it back up. If you're going with the Velcro, don't install it too high lest your cats take a tumble!"
2,Cat loves it,My cat still loves it even though the heater quit within 3 months. And the top doesn't like to stay up on it. The only way to keep it on the window is to use the screws the tape they give you doesn't stay. So now she has a lamp over her bed.
2,Brackets would not hold in place,"The brackets would not hold into place on their own. We ended up using tie wraps to hold them. We are using it, but bought another for twice as much at PetCo. I would advise spending the extra money. So now we have two shelves in separate areas."
2,Our bed was defective,Assembly is easy but the bed we were sent was defective so back it goes. The legs are supposed to snap into place under the platform but the holes on the left side were cut too large so the leg kept falling out. We didn't want to take a chance on another faulty platorm so we'll buy something else. One thing we didn't expect: they used an egg crate type mattress instead of a smooth mattress.
4,Great for the money,"It's a really nice and sturdy cat perch. I definitely installed it with screws in the window seal. BOTH my cats cuddle up on it. It's their favorite place to hang out and watch the world go by. It's also very cute! One of the supports keeps falling off, but I dont' think the supports do a lot of good anyhow. I want to try to find something to pad behind the supports to make them fit tighter."
4,K&H Kitty Sill Deluxe Bolster Cat Bed,"This is an adorable little bed. My cats were not interested at first, but you know how cats are. Finally one of them is using it! The high density foam is nice and the cat pattern fabric is cute. The plastic supports are kind of cheap looking, but overall it's a nice product.Be aware if you have marble window sills, you won't be able to drive a screw through them for added support. So far the velcro is working fine though. Also, I wasn't able to put the bolster opposite the window (to avoid having a cat roll off while stretching or sleeping). Maybe I just couldn't figure out how to do it so I won't fault the item for that.I would buy this again, but probably spray paint the supports so they don't look so cheap."
4,Very scientific.,"As big of a fan I am about evolutionary psychology, especially looking at the sex/gender differences between men and women, I was not so thrilled by this book since it provided such information in much more of a formal and scientific manner. It's not much of an easy read, mainly because of such heavy scientific content presented to such particular individuals who are not very much into the sciences. Despite all things considered, it's very well-written, quite interesting, and very similar to many things I've read on JSTOR."
5,out of the ballpark!,"A big fan of MTB since I first heard them play live, this new cd captures their lively and true ear for great tunes and lyrics. From blues to honkytonk and lots in between, MTB offers it up strong. Only wish I could be sitting around the campfire on a warm country night with them, but listening to ""Ridin the Night Train"" is definitely the next best thing."
5,The inside story on Desert Storm and how we became involved.,"From Kings to Presidents, what an exciting career! Mr. Francona reveals the how and why of Desert Storm and our relationship with the Iraqi's prior to the war. A fascinating story and a great read!"
4,"excellent, readable, overview of a complex series of events","Rick Francona has been in a series of unique situations where he was able to observe the planning and actions of governments and the individuals involved in momentous events. Anyone who has any interest in understanding how US foreign policy gets implemented by the people who actually do it -- and have the adventures to prove it -- will like this book. Rick Francona has a perspective on events in the Persian Gulf and Middle East that is too rare, shaped by actually being there and doing that -- with little applause or credit. Easily readable and understandable, the book describes events and personalities that have shaped defining events that will effect us for many years to come."
5,An Instant Classic,"As someone who has spent the last five years reading exhaustively in the literature on US military intelligence, I can state without hesitation that this is one of the very few books in the field which may labeled a ""classic."" In my judgment it is the best book yet written about the Gulf War, and in that respect it is unlikely to ever be surpassed. I read it in two sittings.ALLY TO ADVERSARY is entertaining without being sensational; the tone is one of quiet gravitas. Although critical of Saudis, the testimony of many others (esp. DIA Col. Pat Lang) affirms that these criticisms were well deserved, and not the product of any bias on Francona's part. He has no axes to grind; and though he was a subjective particpant in much he relates, he manages to remain objective -- truly a marvelous achievement."
5,This is a worthwhile read.,"This is a good read from a unique perspective on the Gulf War in the greater context of the Persian Gulf's geopolitical realities, written from the point-of-view of an intelligence professional and Arabist. If you're looking for the ""magic bullet"" policy prescription for the vexing problem of Saddam Hussein's Iraq, you won't find it here, because the author is the consummate intelligence professional. (Besides, there's a plethora of policy books on the topic, and they don't seem to have enlightened the policy establishment.) If you want a personal perspective on the prelude and events of the war that is dispassionate while humane, and clear without simplifying, this a valuable contribution to the literature"
4,Painless history.... Fascinating from the first word,"Francona captures the romance of the Middle East and contrasts it with the realities of war. Rather than a mere account of the Gulf War, ""Ally to Adversary"" presents the historical background mixed with humorous personal anecdotes - things you did not hear about on the news or in the official reports. It was instructive and entertaining. If you can only read one book on the Gulf War, this is it."
5,Best Book on Shih Tzu EVER,"There are not many books on Shih Tzu, and most of them are formulaic. This book stands out by a mile as the best-written, most informed, most sensible and complete book about the breed. Even though it is an older book, it has not lost anything over the years, because the breed is still the same! The special care that Shih Tzus need is explained here better than you can find it anywhere else. I would say to all breeders, when you sell a puppy, and people want to know what to do, tell them to buy this book, because it is written by two women who were breeders and understood the breed. It doesn't have any chapters in there that some publishers thinks would apply equally to a Great Dane or a Pointer or a Shih Tzu. This book is special, it is all about Shih Tzu. Don't even bother with those other books."
3,Good sheets but not the colors you see,"I order this set of tissue paper only because I saw many yellow sheets, instead there was only 1 sheet :-( And my party is all yellow, I needed yellow sheets! Anyway, there a lot of colors, but too may dark ones..."
4,Great colors!,"Found these to be great for packing special things. The bright colors are different from the regular white tissue paper. The sheets could be a little larger, but all in all good assortment of very vibrant colors."
3,Does the job,I should have read the description before I purchased this. The sheets are very small- not the average size tissue paper. Color assortment is great.
4,Great fun.,"This has been great fun to play with. Greeting cards, scarves, etc. Maybe more ""craft"" than ""art"" but lives up to the description, for sure."
4,lots of color and fun,Good variety of colors and the paper was nice and strong. This is important if you are using it with kid's crafts as I am.
2,This great band deserves better.,"I was greatly dissapointed by this disc. ""Behind The Realms of Madness"" is an overlooked thrash metal masterpiece.It has long been on my wish list of albums that I have wanted to come out on CD.Unfortunately,this disc sounds as if it was recorded off of a used LP. Perhaps the master tapes no longer exist. Even if this is true, more care could have been put into this reissue."
4,shows us how to practice what we preach!!,"Most people sort of uncomfortably gloss over Jesus' words about turning the other cheek. We think of Gandhi or Martin Luther King Jr. and conclude that we're not ""spiritual"" enough to live out his teachings. Or maybe the conflicts we encounter are just too messy, to wrapped up with ""the way the world works"" to have anything to do with this spiritual stuff. Elgin shows that Jesus was not commanding passivity, but instead encouraging us to respond actively and lovingly to those ""difficult"" people in our lives -- even those who have power over us. Her approach combines decent biblical wisdom with sophisticated knowledge of human communication to produce a really practical guide to all kinds of everyday conflicts."
2,Somewhat disappointing,"Elgin raises good questions in her book, but the situations are somewhat overdramatized. The worst part of the book, however, is its emphasis on ""matching styles (hear/see/touch)"" to achieve better communication. For example, if the speaker uses a lot of ""hearing"" words such as ""That sounds strange"" or ""Can't you just listen to me"", then you should respond with similar ""hearing"" vocabulary. In my opinion, this is just window dressing for the main issue: sticking to Proverbs 15:1 (""A gentle answer turns away wrath"") will get you a lot farther.One good point about the book was that it brought up a good rule: assume that someone is speaking the truth (no matter how ridiculous it sounds), and try to find out why the speaker believes that is true. This tehcnique of ""putting yourself in the other person's shoes"" is also explaned well in Covey's _7 Habits of Highly Effective People_."
5,Comprehensive imformational to a reader in rock music!,"Everything accurate that gives music listeners the best and worst rock, rap & soul artist albums reviewd on what CD to get or not buy. Also features every biography story on their life and history of these musical bands. It makes a perfect christmas or birthday gift for anyone who want to know and read about. This is the 2nd edition book on the All Music Guide collection there is also the first and third volume series available!"
3,Pretty good but a waste of money.,"Its well written but its a waste of money if you know about the site verion of All Music Guide which really is one of the best sites on the internet.Not only does the site version have everything the book does and has pictures but also the lists of artists,albums,music styles and reviews are seemingly endless and gloriously delightful."
1,A book by those that can't about those that can play music.,"Primarily the reviews I have read in here are more a collection ""deep thoughts"" from shallow minds. Stephen Thomas Erlewine is a terrible reviewer - I have to wonder if he even listens to the music he reviews. I have to say I fundamentally disagree with him on so many levels that the web isn't a big enough venue. The reviews are inconsistent - Ratings don't match the words. This is at best a half assed work. It is more useful as a brief encylopedia of bands. But it is useless as a guide book to music that is good. I ended up just throwing it in the trash. Don't bother wasting your money."
5,handy basket,this item came in very handy on my wifes walker i do not have to carry items for her i recomend this item for people with this kind of walker.
3,Basket OK,Works OK even without the bar across the bottom between the two legs of the walker. A better description of the item would have been helpful
2,rating basket,"It was helpful, but sometimes it wouldn't hold certain things plus its hard to get on and off the walker. You also need some padding or something to cover because when holding it or taking it in and out it hurt my hand a little bit. Its a good product though."
4,Wonderful set of songs,This set has a good variety of songs that are filled with the holy spirit. It includes some well known worship songs and a good mix of intimate and songs of celebration to the Lord. This set is priceless. I would recommend this to everyone.
5,Rvw,Great book! The suggestions worked really well for our 3 yr old. It's amazing how simple and effective some of the suggestions are. I will be buying the older child version of this book for some help with our 8 yr old as he gets closer to teenage years.
5,Excellent Book!,I highly recommend this book to anyone who has or works with children. Using the Love and Logic principles really makes parenting fun. The expriment I tried with my daughter really worked! It even works over the telephone.
4,Parenting zero to 6 yrs,"The book uses examples to teach how to keep control over your kids and in the classroom when they misbehave. The methods avoid crushing a child's self esteem and is effective, two of the most important criteria for communication as a parent or teacher. I highly recommend Love and Logic for all phases of life. The reader can extend these practices beyond age 6. The book generalizes these principles to be used at all times. For training is listening and problem solving, the book is weak in these areas."
4,Good starter book,"I thought this book was decent in helping learn how to logically dicipline my children. The advice is working great for my two year old who is usually willing to please. However, my 4 year old is strong-willed and we needed a little bit more help with her. If that is your problem as well, try ""Setting Limits with your Strong-willed Child"" by Robert MacKenzie. It also emphasizes logical consequences but also gives other techniques to use with your child that continues to test their limits."
4,Solid parenting advice...after you slog through the first 40 pages,"This is sensible advice that has worked with my 27-month-old son. It reminds you to let your child make mistakes, let him make decisions, let him be responsible. Drawbacks: it tends to be repetitive (probably because the precepts are so simple, if they didn't repeat it they would only have five or six pages' worth...) and the authors cheer themselves on quite a bit. The first forty pages are dedicated to offering examples of just how great Love and Logic is and why you should use it, and had me doubting whether they were going to get around to sharing any valuable information.The principles in this book are a good foundation for child training. It is an important part of our repertoire and is effective. I'm glad we read this book while our oldest child is still in toddlerhood. I recommend it to my friends."
5,love and logic magic for early childhood,"This book is a life saver! It has given us practical tools to use in every-day situations with our children. The book is organized in a clear manner. A real-life parenting challenge is presented, followed by a suggestion to solve it showing love and giving responsibility to the child... and this is with babies! ""Magic"" is not an exagerration. It is often said that children should come with owner's manuals. This is it!!"
4,Healthy attachment IS the point,"I completely disagree with the reviewer who asserted that the authors of the early childhood book were condemning the parent-child bond. To the contrary, that relationship is key to the successful implementation of love & logic. What the authors do assert is that it is not the parents job to solve their childrens problems, rather, they act as consultants and guides, providing opportunities for children to make safe mistakes and good choices, and letting their children bear the burden of their consequences while keeping the loving relationship intact."
2,Some good ideas but totally result oriented,"A lot of the advice in this book is based on results only. I'm sure most of it works! But I don't agree with all of the moral messages in the methods. If you are simply looking for results but not necessarily concerned with the message you are conveying to your child with the disciplinary action, you will love this book. If however you are looking for advice that also considers the morality and ""life lesson"" you may be dissatisfied."
5,every parent should read this book!,"Great book ! easy to read, fun and very interesting ! I would recommend this book to every parent ! it is also very interactive since you can put in practice almost right away the suggestions !Enjoy !!"
4,Good tools!,Great book for some tools to discipline with patience and thoughtfulness! I got it to use with my 1 year old girl. I wish there was some more specifics for very young infants like my daughter though...
2,Poor condition,"This book was in poor shape; the pages were written on, highlighted and lots of them were folded on the corners--I knew when I bought it it was used however I have purchased used books before from Amazon and never were they in such poor condition. It was a gift to my daughter who is a new mother; she was grateful for the book but disappointed in its condition."
4,Giving it a try,"I have really benefited from reading this book. It really takes a lot of patience to retrain your way of thinking. There are times when I just don't have the energy to do it, but when he fights me it shows I have not tried hard enough. It takes the parenting to a different approach and it really works. My youngest child responded quickly to the options. He loves the praise."
4,Great Book,I bought this book to go along with the love and logic class I took and I got a lot out of it. I now use love and logic everyday with my kids. It seems to work great. I wouldn't just buy the book though. Take a class and/or get a CD/DVD or two so that you can hear how to implement the techniques. The wording and how you talk to the kids is KEY to making it a success!
2,"Perhaps ""from toddlerhood through kindergarten""","Putting aside problems with repetitive chapters and poor examples, this book has no relevance to infants, so the title is misleading. I am grateful that the authors clarify that a baby *only* has needs, not wants, and therefore cannot ""manipulate"" an adult.Despite the ""from Birth to Six Years"" of the title, there is little information on parenting during that transition from infancy to toddlerhood. Perhaps the authors are too far removed from their own children's toddler experiences to remember the difficulties of parenting a tiny, willful person who has yet to fully understand cause and effect!If this book was titled differently, and narrowed its focus to preschool-aged children, I could have given it a better review. As it stands, it simply doesn't live up to it's title."
5,Buying my own copy,"A friend of mine loaned me her copy of Love and Logic Magic for Early Childhood: Practical Parenting from Birth to Six Years, and now I'm buying my own! This is a great book and I can't wait to get started using it with my child. He isn't quite 2, so I have some time to practice using the ""uh oh"" song! It's easy to read and understand. This book is a must for all parents!"
4,Really helped!,I got this book and put it to work and I can tell a diffrence in my children within the first few days of using there techniques. I would recommend this book to all parents.
3,Simple and Do-able - Yes,"For me Love and Logic is good, but it's not great. I would still recommend it to every parent however. It was only OK for me because I have already been doing a lot of the techniques, because yes, they are logical. I guess I feel that not all issues can be solved with Love and Logic and there are some situations that have no natural consequence. Maybe I'm not as creative as the authors want or my 3 year old just doesn't seem to care about consequences. I'm not sure, but even living the Love and Logic way doesn't help everything. You can see I'm torn. Good book. Definitely useful. Maybe it was the way it was written or the examples that were given. Not sure. It just didn't strike me as a full 5 stars"
5,Good help!,"I'm so glad a friend recommended this book. Everything in it makes sense! While I don't believe in absolutes nor that any piece of advice will work every time, the methods and tactics recommended here make sense over the long haul. I want to be the best parent I can be in an effort to have my kids be successful in their lives....whatever that means to them! The tactics in this book help me help them be independent, think on their own and make choices that make the most sense for the situations they are in."
5,At last I can enjoy my toddlers!,"I love this book for toddlers to preschoolers. This is such an effective way of parenting and you can see progress so quickly. I wish I started this with my five year old when he was two. My two year old has it down already in one week and is so much easier to manage as well as happier. We are all enjoying each other instead of a constant battle. I get to be loving all of the time and never ""cross"" with them and they get to make so many choices and feel more in control."
4,Good philosophy.,"I thought this book was going to be a bit different. I thought it would have a little humor and have give general tips for dealing with toddlers. Although not what I expected this book have a overall teaching philosophy that I think might be helpful. It takes patience and time to get the hang of what they recommend....it's not difficult, actually rather simple, but just takes patience. Interesting to check out though...and in a ideal world I think most parents would parent this way most of the time."
5,Love and Logic,I bought this because I was looking for some new techniques for my 4 yr old after the birth of my new baby. The techniques in this book really work. My 4 yr old and I both have a much lower level of frustration at the end of the day since I've tried Love and Logic. It's a fast book to read and the techniques are very easy to follow.
3,lacking substance for age group,"Although Love and Logic clearly seems to be effective for older age children, this particular book tends to be lacking in substantive examples for the early childhood years and somewhat redundant in its examples. I've concluded that other parental guidelines for the early childhood ages are more effective and helpful. [Of course the suggestion that consequences when applied are logical and appropriate to the behavior exhibited is appropriate no matter what age group]Other Love and Logic books are much more helpful, designed for school age children."
1,Don't Waste Your Time - Read the Original,"Like other reviewers, I bought this book looking for specifics to apply to my preschooler. I loved the first book, and assumed I'd love this one too. WRONG!!! The writing style is totally annoying (and as one of the reviewers noted, it IS written entirely by the son, even though Jim Fay is listed as the first author). Though there are some good tidbits of how to apply Love & Logic (though none of them work on my child, even though I've tried for a couple weeks now), I realized when I went back to the original book that those same pieces of information are there, just packaged a little differently. For a less-than-200 page book (with LARGE type), this is a waste of money for $16+ and the minimal new material over the original. I noticed that they original Parenting with Love & Logic is to be republished in 2006 -- save your money and wait for that."
3,Some good advice,"I ordered this book to learn how to approach disciplining my nearly one year old son. Although this book seems to have good advice for managing discipline for an older child, it barely mentions anything under the age of two besides repeating that it's never too early to start their discipling methods. I'm no child expert (hence my purchase of this book), but I feel certain that all of the authors' advice is going to be completely lost on any child under two. Though I recognize that one is certainly too young for the discipline they mention in this book, I know one must get a handle on disciplining methods early on in order to avoids those child behaviors we all hope our own children will never engage in."
1,Not my style,"Many of my friends use it and swear by it. But it's not my style at all, I feel like I end up punishing myself too many times, by having to pick up the toys, kids not bathing. The kids don't always remember everything for next time, and I don't have the patience to keep up with it."
3,quite ok but not for attachment parenting,"This book will be quite nice for people just trying to raise responsible children in the usual trend of raising kids.But for those who've started with attachment parenting, it's close to useless and some advice will even be considered as lacking respect for the child.There's something about the style of writing too! It's like reading something recorded on a tape during a conference and put into words. I'm sorry but when I read I expect something written in the same way as when I give oral assignments to my students, I do not expect oralized writing. There you feel like reading something you could hear at a parenting class Which feels weird.Apart from that, there is sometimes sound advice, so you can give it a try..."
2,love and logic magic for early years,"Overall I was pleased with this book... the concept is amazing, and the experiments have helped us witrh our three kids tremendously... the only complaint I would have is that I ordered it used, and the book is missing chapts. 6-8.... I dont know if its a publishing problem or not.... but chapt. 6, 7, 8 were missing and then chapt. 9 and 10 were repeated twice!! ???"
1,Returned This Item,I bought this item and returned it after it stopped working after two days. The massages were not that strong and I feel it was not a good buy even though the price at Amazon was way lower than most places. I have since bought another product and it is much nicer.
2,I regret,"I was looking forward to get the massager, which I was for a while searching. But I regret to inform you that I could use this item for only 2 times @ 15 minutes. After the it didn't work. (the light on the adapter do not work) I'm glad that I can express this."
3,massaging back cushion,"seemed to short for me and I am just 5'7"". To have it it me in my sore neck, the lower back massage was actually at mid back level. When I lowered it to help my lower back, I was massaged also on mid shoulder. Only way I could use it was to do my neck the lower to do my lower back seperately. Gave it to my shorter daughter"
5,Nicer then expected..,The clock I ordered for my kitchen. The wood is very nice and more expensive looking then actually was. Very nice.
1,Didn't work!!,I was so excited when I found this in VHS. I didn't put it in for a while after purchasing. When I did put it in the player it did not work at all! Since it was so cheap it would have been too much money and hassle to send back. Will not purchase anything from this seller again. There was no way they didn't know this tape was broken.
5,Fast results and easy to do!,"After using this tape for only about a week, I've already noticed results. Combined with only about 20-30 minutes on the treadmill, I've noticed a BIG difference in the way my abs look. Tamilee is not irritating, and is a great instructor. She explains each move carefully, and the movements are not overly hard to do. I also like how it's divided into three different 15 minute segments. It alleviates boredom with just one routine. I highly recommend this video."
2,Great for beginner only!,"I already work out 4 days a week at the gym so this was too easy for me, besides its also ackward,uncomfortable and hurts your back. Grab something a little more updated instead."
5,The life changer,"Abs of steel: This video really works. I am a younger guy, and after years of binge drinking I worked up a pretty nice beer gut. I finally had enough. I found this video, and did the workouts. (Stay away from fastfood, and don't eat before you goto bed) I LOST 50 lbs! This video works if you let it. If you want to slim down, this is the video. I lost about 1-2 pounds everytime I did it."
5,Perfect!,"This Video is excellent. I provides you with options in how to perform the exercises depending on your individual ability level so that it is not too hard when you are a beginner, but you can still use it when you've attained abs of steel!! The instructor is extremely fake and over enthusiastic, but it's worth it because the results are excellent!!!!"
3,Decent satellites but spend a little more and get better,I sound tested these at my local Best Buy and was happy with the sound quality that they presented. Listened to some jazz and classical on these speakers and found them to be relatively crisp but lacking in strength.I also tested the higher end SAT-5 Cerwin Vegas and was definitely more impressed. They are only a little more expensive and you'll get the quality of these speakers plus a whole lot more.
1,omitted information,"Unfortunately, most of the listings fail to note that this volume is in theFrench language and, worse, that it is a new French edition of a very familiar (and wonderful) coffee table book in English that all Versailles lovers bought back in the early 90's. The dust jacket would make it appear to be something new - it ain't. I am presently stuck with a copy I ordered from Canada. Returning it would entail MASSIVE postage. Forewarned is forearmed. Terry Allen"
2,Disappointed,"...is how I felt when the book arrived. Most of the illustrations are studio leftovers, preparatory sketches, discarded works and so. Little work as the one in the cover. This book is not as those on Michael Whelan or Jeff Jones. The text I tried to read but couldn't."
2,Self-indulgent,"In his introduction to volume 1 of OPUS, Barry Windsor-Smith cautions the reader that this won't be a typical memoir, so you can't accuse him him of not being upfront. But were it not for his typically stellar artwork, this and OPUS 2, the next in his (presumably now-moribund) series of autobiograpical ramblings, would be intolerable. Clearly there was a pivotal moment in Windsor-Smith's life in 1973 that he talks about in gratingly obscure fashion (Gabriel Garcia Marquez he's not!), and I'm sure it was important to him, but he fails to make a case for why I, as a reader, should care at all. I got both of the OPUS volumes as remainders for significantly lower than their list price, and for the artwork alone it was money well spent. Otherwise, I'd rather Windsor-Smith kept his musings either to a diary or a therapist."
3,Disapointed.,"HiI've read several chapters of this book and realized that it's not the right book for me. The book goes into too much details about frequency and such. I expected a simple ""how to"" book that teaches me how to improvise and transcribe. Another thing is this book expect the reader to go into the music business or really serious about music. I'm not saying i'm not serious about music but when i bought this book I just had the sudden urge to learn to transcribe and improvise. So if you're not seriously into music and not ready to do exercises such as ""make your own instrument"" then don't buy this book. This is my first review and I know it's not a very good one. Any comments or suggestions please email me at henryyu451@yahoo.com. And if any recommendations for books that teaches how to ""free-style"" on the piano or/and transcribe please email me."
2,This book will do you little good,"This book, as good as it may be according to some of the other reviewers, will do you little good unless you spend a lot of time with a good ear-training software program. There are quite a few out there that should do the trick. Actually, save your money and just get the ear-training software. That's all you really need to master what this book can only help you conceptualize about."
2,Dull training for the professional musician.,"It was an interesting read for about the first half. Then I realized that it's just an organized list of work to do in order to be able to hear and write music. The actual ""training"" I was looking for in the book was lacking. Each chapter has a list of dry exercises to be done to develop hearing and writing skills. This follows paragraphs of the author's analysis of what music is. So now I know I have to learn to hear and write intervals, rhythm, scales, modes and chords. Well, I knew that before I bought the book. I was hoping for interesting and fun training to make the task less tedious. Writing music by hand is advocated yet I couldn't find any training in writing notes, clefs, symbols, rests etc. with a pencil. Perhaps it's buried somewhere in the 431 pages. There is some useful reference information here, but most of the time it sits on my bookshelf."
4,A compilation of many others,"This one does not feel like a book (since it's a companion to The Alchemist), as there is no story, but rather a set of thoughts. It reads fast if you know the original sources so i'm not sure it's worth compared to things like Tao the Ching, The Art of War, and other classics. It may help when reading the Alchemist, at least to indicate at which level the Alchemist should be read, but alone it is simply a compilation of other works. Might be useful to read again the Alchemist after reading this one..."
1,A Sad Disappointment,"Coming from one of my very favorite authors, this collection of common place and banality is really depressing.This book tries to be a modern Bushido but it doesn't reach the level of Bushido's knees.Bushido took almost three centuries to be perfected, maybe Master Coelho had to give his Warrior a little more time. Light is a very powerful entity, it shouldn't be treated like a fast money making commodity."
3,"Interesting, exhausting, but worth the effort","This is a series, a very long series, of wisdom statements each of which are worthy of reflection and further thought. However, there are so many that at times I have to take break to have them settle in my mind."
4,Nice and Reassuring,This book was an awesome follow-up to The Alchemist. I enjoyed reading it and thought it brought an interesting perspective to the lessons presented in The Alchemist.
5,Never give up!,"Warrior of the Light is a wonderful book to read with clear and easy to comprehend messages. Simple truths yet profound insights - if I were to sum it up in one sentence.The beauty of the book lies in the fact that it addresses the various situations we face in life at an inner level - no matter which external path of life we may be on - and reveals insights that inspire us to never give up hope and keep courage so that we can fulfill our highest purpose. If self-discovery is your life mission then this book is especially for you, all you warriors of the light!"
5,Warrior of the Lighy,Absolutely loved it! The messages between the lines can be used as a guide to go thru life. The book can be read over and over again for new insights with each reading.
5,Warrior Wisdom,"""That is why he is a Warrior of the Light, because he has been through all this and yet has never lost hope of being better than he is."" -from the book.I love how this book shows the good and bad of our human nature and blesses it all. We all have within us the light and the dark. Which one will we allow to guide us? We are whole because of both.This book is encouraging and truthful, and full of wisdom. As you read this, you will take a look inside yourself and acknowledge what is there. This is a good book to keep out where you can pick it up and read something from it often. It's great to keep by your bedside for light reading before bed, or in the morning when you get up.""In order to have faith in his own path, he does not need to prove that someone else's path is wrong."" -one of my favorite passages from the book.I hope you'll read and enjoy this too!"
5,A Manual for Fighting the Good Fight,"Again, Coelho succeeds in providing inspiration and spiritual direction in life. This book acts a guide to becoming a superior human being on a journey toward genuine success and greatness. Paulo is has absolutely tapped into the truth of the universe. Thanks again for a great book that I can apply to my Daily Walk. Highly recommended."
3,Worth some nuggets,"This book reminds me the technique used by sitcoms to pull flashbacks from a whole season of episodes, stick an opening and closing on each end and call it a new show. For that reason, I did not feel it was quite as enjoyable to read as The Alchemist. Stylistically, Alchemist is like an Old Testament narrative where Warrior is like reading Proverbs. There were, however, some wonderful ""nuggets"" of pure gold that I find myself reading over and over - even commiting to memory. It is a worthwhile volume to have and would recommend it to any reader who enjoys Coelho's work."
5,Comfort reading,"What I like most about this book is that it celebrates the journey of life by putting equal value upon the inevitable successes, failures, mistakes, heartbreak and joy we all experience along the way. The book imparts comfort along with it's wisdom, very important I think."
2,-,"Did not really hold my interest as I was thinking it was a novel but turned out to be a self help guide for some who may need it, just not me."
2,Joe's Review,Book is somewhat repititous with a religious bent. After a while it became a bit boring.
2,Disappointed,"It's sad to write a ""not so good"" review about this book being that it was written by Paul Coelho. I read the Alchemist multiple times and really enjoyed it. So it was with great enthusiasm I moved on to read Warrior of the Light, as I figure Paulo could do no wrong. I figured there would be so many life lessons etc that I could apply to my own life. I did encounter a few, however, i stopped less than half way into the book. I just could not bring myself to finish the book. I did not like it. Whilst reading I felt like I was reading the ""Art of War"" by Sun Tzu. I did not see much of a story line, just a list of things a warrior of the light would and would not do. I had to stop reading as I was finding it difficult to continue. This will not deter me from reading other books by Coelho, but I do hope I am not disappointed again."
3,not that good !,"the book it self is not in a good condition, the paper was cut in such a horrible way, the ending of the pages are badly damaged,for the content the book is good, it's been written by Paulo Coelho and that is enough for meone thing to mention: BE ALERT! this is not a novel!"
3,not bad,This book reads like a metaphorical instruction manual to life. Pretty interesting if you like Paulo's work.
4,You have to read The Alchemist first before reading this one,"WARNING: read The Alchemist first before reading this.Warrior of the Light is not a fiction, except for the introduction and the ending, but you will likely ponder about it anyway. It's a spiritual companion for The Alchemist, therefore after you have read The Alchemist you will need to read Warrior of the Light. If you have read The Alchemist, congratulations, you have joined many people, a community, that have had their view of life improved after reading it. Now you can go ahead and read Warrior of the Light just to enhance the way you will live your life."
3,"Great idea, cheaply made","This corkscrew design is incredible. Had no problem using it. The only problem I have is with the foil cutter. It broke within 3 months of use and is made out of cheap plastic. Since it is included in the corkscrew holder, a broken foil cutter is not something I want to be displayed. I would recommend against buying Sharper Image products: overpriced and made with low quality materials."
1,"Worked fine, then didn't","This corkscrew worked great for the first three months but now the teeth in the handle have locked-up and won't budge. It looked great in the package but it's made with inexpensive materials, evident when you first pick it up. The foil cutter broke in the first month we had it. Don't waste your money."
1,"If you buy cheap, you buy twice",Out of the box failure.This deluxe kit comes nicely packaged and with a vacuum stopper and steel gasket stopper. It also comes with a foil cutter and stand for your opener. I was a little concerned when I saw a spare corkscrew.The problem is the corkscrew opener does not work.There are straightfoward instructions but the corksrew just does not pull the cork out. It is always disappointing when you can't get the bottle open. The corkscrew goes in easily but it is supposed to lock in and pick up another piece when fully inserted. Mine just wouldn't release the piece and the cork screw came back out while the cork remained.I recommend not breaking the deluxe pieces or your bottle. Just place everything back in the package and return while store is still in business.
1,Worst cork puller I've ever used,"First of all this thing is big and clunky. While it does look neat the actual function is HORRIBLE. After I think 3 bottles of wine this puller now refuses to work, it will burry the corkscrew but will not pull the cork out.The little cheap plastic foil cutter is the only part of this expensive cork puller that works. Don't buy this, stick with a good old-fashioned corkscrew."
4,Useful,This set was helpful in preparing for my undergrad microbio course. It basically covered the human diseases in an easy-to-read format. Recommended. I used this instead of a text book.
4,Dan channels JLP,"Dan's new EP shows a harder edge compared to his country-twangy album Big Black Guitar. Having seen him support Steve Earle in April 2002 in Melbourne, I rushed out to buy his stuff. There's a great energy in his live shows, and this 4-track EP shows definite Gun Club tendencies, especially on the title track."
3,kinda funny,not as funny as alot of the reviews said...but I did get a few laughs out of it. I am not really suprised that it didnt make it to a second season.
5,Love the show.,"I love this show since the first episode. I am mad as hell that fox canceled it after only two seasons. Does anyone know when season two will hit shelves. i realise that the first season came out not too long ago, but, i love the show and would like to know if it is possible."
5,One of my favorite shows,Finally this is coming to dvd. This show is really great. Very funny heartwarming sit-com about a family. It's on thursday at 8:30/7:30 pm. central on FOX.
3,Mediocre Finish,"The mirror housing has casting blemishes and the glass has discoloration around the edges. The factory mirror is nicer, bt costs 4 times as much. I don't really care, my kids seem to knock the mirror off every 24 moths and it should look fine that long. Seriously, if you expect factory quality, look elsewhere, but if you don't look too close, this looks fine and the price is right."
5,Master The Masterclass!,"All I can say is Brilliant. I have been tying for over half my life and still love learning! Oliver produces not only beatiful, but extremely effective creations. Its a pity there are only 20 patterns! I would encourage any tyer to have a go at these patterns and produce tight lines !"
3,Not what you would expect,"We have all waited for the sophomore album of Donnie's after the success of his first one. Surprisingly and unfortunately he added the vocals of his family members and changed the style of his music. Even with the good vocals, I always feel that I do not hear enough of Donnie McClurkins' voice and feel as if I own some other CD. If you want to buy this to hear him, it won't be what you'd expect."
2,NOT MUCH DONNIE!,"Being the Donnie Mcclurkin fan that I am, I immediately rushed out and picked this one up. Unforunately, I was disappointed to hear only one or two songs actually song by Donnie. The rest are very good praise and worship songs, but not what I expected. I've heard better!"
2,IF YOU LIKE GOOD GOSPEL MUSIC DONT GET THIS!!,OK FIRST I THOUGHT SENCE DONNIE MCCLURKIN WAS ON THIS ALBUM HE WAS GOING TO GIVE US SOMETHING NEW WITH A TIGHT BEAT AND SOME GOOD OLD TIME CHURCHIN BUT WHEN I LESENT TO THIS CD. IT WAS TERRIBLE IT WASENT INTERSTING. dONT GET ME WRONG THEY ARE GREAT AWESOME SINGERS BUT THE SONGS WASNT GOOD THATS ALL.
1,Mel Torme under water,It's a double CD at a bargain price but it's not a bargain. I checked out the first CD and discovered the 2 of the tracks were without Mel Torme. Studio orchestra is mostly strings and the overall quality and frequency response left much to be desired. There were no liner notes about the CD.
4,Pricing Derivative Securities: An Interactive Dynamic Envir,"The theory of financial derivates is now much easily understood by combining mathemtical models with the symbolic, numeric and visualization capabilities of a CAS such as Maple. The author made an excellent choice to select Maple (primarily) and Matlab. Maple is used extensively in many academic and industry settings, and its integration into the presentation of the materials makes the content come alive. Great addition, that (even) every mathematician should read! I highly recommend it."
3,Great if your sailing,"If you are chartering a sailboat around French Polynesia you should get this book or the Charlies charts book to plan your itinerary. Bring it along and use it too. It helps you navigate, saves you time by pointing out good anchorages, and gives you perspective as to where you are when you are sailing around. If your not sailing, get one of the travel books. Find out which ones by reading my trip report at DiveAtlas.com."
5,Wonderful!,"This is by far the best Children's CD I've ever heard. The songs are so sweet and sung so beautifully. Elizabeth Mitchell's voice is perfect and she sings the songs just slow enough and clear enough that kids can hear and learn the words. My 26 month old daughter knows the words to most of the songs and loves the CD as much as I do. My husbands only complaint is that we don't hear enough of Dan's voice. At last we have a CD we all love! Thank you, thank you, thank you! I feel lucky to know about this CD."
4,Great Music,"Elizabeth Mitchell is kids music that adults can listen to over and over again without losing their minds. My daughter is a year old and we have been listening to Elizabeth Mitchell since she was born and we are not tired of it yet. We have all her cds and our favorite is her latest release, You Are My Little Bird."
5,Love It!,"I love this CD, and so do the 2-year-olds I work with at a Christian daycare center. The CD begins with a song the kids and I often sing, ""This Little Light of Mine"", so that's what the kids ask for. I love Elizabeth Mitchell's voice as well as the harmony and guitar playing. The style reminds me of Peter, Paul, and Mary."
3,Early Work,"I am a fan of this artist, but this album was an early work made at a friends house. It is not of the same quality as more recent releases. It would have been fine for $7."
4,creative urges,"this book is great for the cards and images associated with the cards. i found the exercises a bit simple at first but the more i did of the cards the deeper i had to dig and the more i was able to mine from this wonderful book.highly recommend for the ""beginner"" creative seeker. this would definitely be the book i would suggest before sending someone on ""the artist's way"" as it is a much less rigorous (spelling bee) creative grabber but an excellent beginning."
3,Outer Limits,"This compilation of wordcraft and art was somewhat refreshing for me, who regularly keeps a journal. While the artwork gave the whole ""journal experience"" a needed lift, the subject matter was at times too vague. Although the overall experience was different from how I keep my personal journal, it is clear that the two authors are definitely at the ""outer limits."" Perhaps ahead of their time? Or, are they on to something real?"
4,Generations: A Record Book of Our Family,"The book was received about a week after ordering. As stated by the seller, the book was in good condition. I was surprised at the condition, especially finding that the book was out of print."
5,excellent bible study resource,"Baxter's ""Explore the Book"" is one of the most excellent surveys of scripture available. Dr. Baxter's comments are warm, devotional, and practical. However, his suggestion of a possible mid-tribulational rapture (instead of pre-tribulational) concerns me, as does his hyper-dispensational view that Israel was offered the Kingdom a second time in the book of Acts. The Bible clearly teaches that Israel will not receive the Kingdom until the glorious appearing of Jesus Christ and the establishment of his literal, physical Millenial Reign at the end of the Great Tribulation period. Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone desiring a deeper understanding of the Bible."
2,Not impressed,"Maybe my OCD is rearing it's head here but I was really appalled at the grammatical errors in this book! It's hard for me to take an author very seriously when he can't spell or use punctuation correctly. Aside from this, Explore The Book was not at all what I expected it to be. There isn't a book I enjoy studying more than the Bible and I just knew that this book was going to be a gem. Wrong! Simply not impressed at all. Def returning this one. Sorry. :("
4,"Excellent shape, but smelly","I received my book, ""Baxter's Explore the Book"", in a timely manor and packaged very well. The condiditon was great and the book was in excellent shape,unfortunately, it reeked of moth balls! Seller suggested I put it out in the sun and spray with lysol! I nixed the lysol suggestion but did leave it out in the sun and let the wind blow the pages. After a week of that it finally was acceptable enough to come into the house. I wish the seller had warned me about the moth balls! I guess the lesson is ""buyer be ware""!"
1,Not United States Law.,"When I sat down to read this book I realized that this book was intended for the United Kingdom. Well, that's money down the drain."
1,should say UK edition in LARGE PRINT,"WHY DOESN'T IT SAY UK EDITION IN BIG? WHAT ARE THEY AFRAID OF, PEOPLE NOT BUYING WHAT THEY DON'T NEED?"
3,The Text is Abridged from the French,"And, of course, the parts that I specifically wanted to read are not even present in this translation.In particular, if you were interested in the references to this text from the footnotes referenced in Antigones: How the Antigone Legend Has Endured in Western Literature, Art, and Thought by George Steiner, none of those parts are included in this abridgment of Introduction to the Reading of Hegel."
4,"Not the best version, but will do","The series is based on the two Jackie Chan comedy movies. The first 10 episodes or so are directly from the movies and are funny. After that the characters just keep moving as if they can't seem to stop, and there isn't another funny moment, really. It isn't bad, though, just not funny.This particular version is rather solarized; the colors are very saturated, so the sky is always white, for example. I also have a pirated version that doesn't have this problem."
3,"Beautiful pictures, but not much more","The photos in this abridged edition of Pakenham's book are worth seeing. They are incredibly beautiful and moving. The text of the book, however, is hard to follow and almost unreadable. This is a very abridged edition of the larger work. A great coffee table book, but look elsewhere for serious study of the Great Rebellion of 1798."
2,rather sloppily done,"I'm not qualified to comment on the above reviewer's opinions regarding the historical merit of this book, but I can say this: it is badly written. Pakenham is no prose stylist, and is often almost embarassingly clumsy. He needs an editor. However, I thought his sequencing skillful; but as I said, I'm no expert."
5,A surprisingly wonderful CD!,"I bought this item one day while browsing music because it was on sale and I like both Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings. I thought they would sound good together. I never imagined the CD would be so fantastic! Their voices and spirits compliment each other so beautifully that the result is a feeling of floating away on a sea of absolutely gorgeous music! If you like Willie and Waylon, this CD is for you."
5,Great version,"if you are interested in the new year's concert, you should get it!!!! It is very nice and the songs here are nice~~~"
5,Beautiful Music,"I felt loved.,,Just listening to this CD. Every song is Beautifully Written, the arrangements,and Kevin's voice just AMAZING! I highly highly recommend!!!"
5,Great Cookbook!,"I recently purchased ""Jell-O Collection"", and I must say that it's jam packed with excellent, easy to follow recipes - plus, most of the recipes only call for a few ingrediants, so you can have dessert whipped up in no time!In this book, you'll find everything from parfaits to beautiful & delicious pies, as well as several ""fun"" desserts for kids. There is also a whole section on cream cheese desserts as well.Overall, I would recommend this cookbook to anyone who loves jell-o gealtin, pudding &/or cream cheese - as well as those who just love dessert in general."
3,"Enjoyable, but I can't help wondering...","While I greatly enjoyed this book and found it very readable, I couldn't help but notice a curious and striking depth of detail that seemed apparent in every series of events the author related. Surely after some 60 years he couldn't have that accurate a recollection(?). I can understand that a certain amount of this is necessary to lend to readability, but he strikes me as going overboard with it to the point that I questioned the truthfulness of his accounts. I lean toward giving him the benefit of the doubt, owing to my huge reverence for veterans, yet I am aware of the presence of exaggerators and outright impostors, and sincerely hope this is not such a case."
5,Nice Basic Clock,"This is a nice basic clock that is perfect for the kitchen or basement. It keeps good time, is quiet, is easy to read, and the battery lasts a long time. It comes in several colors including green, blue and white. Overall, it is a good value."
1,junk clock,"The clock worked for a couple of days and quit, I put in another new battery and it worked for only minutes and died. It is now trash, don't waste the few dollars for this clock."
4,westclox hunter green kitchen clock,"Received this product timely and in great condition. Put in a new battery, set the time and hung it on the wall. It looks great and keeps accurate time. A very nice product"
1,please dont buy this clock,"I bought 2 westclock wall clocks from amazon. It was supposed to be a great deal, which itwasn't as one of the clocks doesnt work! The cheap chinese stuff has flooded american markets and there is no quality control at all."
5,A treasure Biography with humor thrown in,"I love comics. So there was no doubt in my mind that I wouldn't enjoy this book. But the sheer amount of information and humor Mort Walker puts into this book set me aback. Mort Walker himself is so intertwined with famous cartoonists it's no wonder he writes such an excellent strip. This book is a must read if you are even remotely interested in comics or humor. That's why I rated it 5 out of 5 stars, and give it a hearty thumbs up and my hopes and good wishes for the cartoonist."
4,Good product,This product works as promised. The installation was easy and it was at a very good price.
5,Instructions not included,Ordered this product on March 17th and had it on March 20th..Now that's fast service. Kit works perfectly. My only complaint was that therewere no instructions with the product.
2,Live Berry For Completists Only,"Many reviews of Chuck's live shows since the 1980s have been critical, noting sloppy, out-of-tune performances with unrehearsed backing bands. Unfortunately, this disc does little to alter that image. Recorded in the UK in September of '83, Berry and the uncredited band stumble through classics like ""School Days"", ""Sweet Little Sixteen"" and ""Roll Over Beethoven"" over 44 minutes. ""Bio"" and a soulful ""Every Day I Have The Blues"" are much better. However, when Chuck shifts back into his own songbook, the lyrics and meter are just way off. Daughter Ingrid Berry is the featured vocalist on several of the tracks, turning in credible renditions of ""Keys To The Highway"" and ""Got My Mojo Working"". Although the sound quality is good throughout, the package contains no liner notes or photos. Fans looking for an example of Chuck on stage would do much better seeking out his 1986 60th Birthday concert."
1,Avoid this card,"I purchased this card for the purpose of passing through Dolby Digital from my Home Theater PC to my external Sony amplifier. I could never get anything but 2 channel stereo to work. I spent weeks trying different decoders and software to no avail. This card is an OEM product. Although not stated, there is no warranty and it is not supported by Turtle Beach. You are on your own using it. I eventually learned the card by design DOES NOT pass through Dolby Digital as advertised but instead down converts it to 2 channel PCM.I replaced the card with a different brand and it worked immediately without any effort other than selecting S/PDIF output."
4,"Refreshing, well-written and truly enjoyable","I read this story to my children ranging in age from 7 to 12. They thoroughly enjoyed the characters (especially their names - Me Too, etc.) as well the story itself. What a refreshing and comfortable story it was. I congratulate the author for his approach to storytelling, and my children are anxiously awaiting his next release!"
2,DISAPPOINTING PRODUCT,"I am very disappointed with this Microsoft keyboard, however, I like the mouse very much. My biggest problem with the keyboard is how stiff the keys are!!!! I have never felt such stiff keys on any Microsoft keyboard before. The second disappointment is that the letters are already wearing off of the keys and I have only been using it for approximately one month. While I definitely do not need the letters to be printed on the keys to know where they are since I touch-type, I would not have expected them to wear off so quickly. In summary, although I don't hate the keyboard enough to send it back and incur shipping charges since it was reasonably priced in the first place, I definitely would not buy another one of this model and will even consider other brands if Microsoft has changed all of their keyboards to now have such stiff keys."
4,good,it got here on time and it worksi tested it and the mouse works across the room but gets really jumpy after about 6feet which is the rcomended rangeall the extra buttons work fine although i havnt programed the email button
2,Junk receiver,"The wireless operation is indeed rated to 6 feet according to the included documentation. But it's really no good for over a few feet. Even then the slightest obstruction (like my knee) will block the signal. The mouse and keyboard themselves are of OK quality, although some keys stick. The real sticking point is the erratic range of the wireless signal. Buy something else."
4,Lots of Political Laughs,"I've had this in cassette form for over 20 years and it's still as hilarious as it was then. Thought it was time to go to a CD in case the tape is destroyed. It goes to show that politics doesn't change much, only the names ... most of the political situations aren't much different and some of the cast of characters are still around, such as Joe Biden. All four of these guys are hilarious and it's a lot of laughs while looking back at the election year 1988."
4,Insightful!,"As an Army Ranger, Dean Hohl endured Ranger School, in which he was forced to figure out how to survive 14 days in the woods with only 14 meals. He later parachuted into Panama during the U.S. invasion. Now a consultant who leads corporate types through Ranger-style boot camps, Hohl and co-author Maryann Karinch make a convincing case that business leaders can benefit from the same type of training Rangers are given. Organizations need leaders who are flexible and communicative, he argues in an engaging and illustrative way. Hohl resists the temptation to dwell too much on his own war stories, although at times he'd do well to rely more on his experiences and less on bloodless summaries of corporate problems seemingly parroted from the business press. We recommend this book to any manager who leads or works with a team. If you wish that your team could act like a Ranger platoon, start reading."
2,Ultra-light,"This is a ""B"" musical from Columbia Pictures in 1940. The acting is poor, the music (with one exception)is forgettable, the comedy is pathetic, and Rita Hayworth is utterly wasted. The only bright spot is the voice of Tony Martin. Still, he's wasted too, having to pretend that he can sing opera.Save your money."
1,When first you chance to deceive,"As someone who has been in the education field for years, I feel compelled to point out that this book does not adequately address the legal loopholes involved in ""compiling"" versus ""plagiarizing."" While plagiarizing, as all who have tangled with it know, is something engaged in by those lacking in imagination and is relatively easy to accomplish on the internet, compiling is a much more subtle, sophisticated way of stealing and utilizing the ideas of others and honing them in such a way as to make it very difficult to determine from whence they have come. Indeed, while plagiarism will undoubtedly earn you an F in most courses, compiling can often earn you up to a B with no one the wiser."
1,Well-meaning...,"A rambling book that seems to be about a flawless Buddha looking for love at first sight. It is absolutely jammed with new-age generalities, grafting every ""being who is at peace with nature"" cliché into a cross-cultural version of the ancient character of Kokopelli (and making him tall, dark and handsome, to boot). The story is in great need of editing; it got tiresome to me in a short time and is way too long for a young child. That and the computer-generated drawings lean toward the commercial graphic end of things stand as than truly expressive, artistic illustration.Being a Californian, I am VERY familiar with new-age appropriation of a mythical Native American past and am not a fan of such depictions. If you have dream catchers, rainbow stained glass and vegan tendencies you wish to indoctrinate your children with, go for it."
5,Here's wishing for a second Cagney collection,"the James Cagney Signature collection, is a great way to introduce Cagney's non gangster films to a new generation of film fans.Most people only know of his tough guy/gangster films. Such as White Heatthe Public Enemy. or ""G""Men.But Jimmy Cagney was such a versitile actor. That he could and did playother type of people. Singers, dancers, circus performers. young lover,soilder, admirals and the hardest role of all, playing another actor.As he did in ""Man of a Thousand Faces"". But his best role to me, was inthe movie ""The Gallent Hours"". When he played Admiral William F. Halsey.This was his best role as the couragous commander of the Pacific Fleet duringthe middle phase of WW2.I am hoping for a seconed Signature Collection that includ these last two films.As well as some of his later work during late fifties and early sixies.Before he retired."
5,Cagney at his best,"Cagney from a bygone Hollywood era appears asgeless and timeless in this series. J.C. was one of the movies all time greats and this Cagney series is what Hollywood should be producing today. Cagney,Stewart. Wayne, Fonda (Henry that is ) and Bogart knew how to make movies that pleased their audiences. This Cagney series is a collectors treasure that every move buff will want to have in their collecton. This is a buy, AND HOW !!!!!!!"
5,Cagney versatility.,It just shows us that he was really a true Hollywood actor who could play serious roles as well as comedy.
4,Give Cagney a look.,"This was ordered by mistake, but we watched it and found the films enjoyable. Having never seen a Cagney film, I was aware of him only as a punch line. The studio system of the era probably did not utilize his talents optimally, but he did some fine acting nonetheless. I will seek out some of his better known films and watch his Oscar winning performance in Yankee Doodle Dandy."
3,More current bonus features,"I like the movies that are included, but I've seen them before on TCM. I don't really care about vintage short subjects. I wish there were more current special features like current documentaries about the movies that are in the set or commentaries on the movies. That was why when selecting a box set to purchase this month, I got the Tyrone Power set since he is another of my favorite actors."
4,An Excellent Book,"The concept of common carriage is generally assumed and universally misunderstood. One aspect of the historical mythology that is contorted beyond recognition is the liability of common carriers for the goods carried. If a telegraph, telephone (or dare I say Internet network) mangles the message and causes harm, what liability does that carrier have - and more importantly - why? Barbara Cherry looks at the theoretical underpinnings of the regulatory position and how liability faces new challenges in the post telecom act of 1996 era."
2,The don't make 'em like they used to.,"This is no where near the quality of the original Storyteller. When I bought it I thought since it was cheap, and since I loved the first soo much that it wouldn't be so bad. Boy was I wrong. Every story dissapointed me, and it's a black mark on Jim Henson's name in my opinion. Save your money!"
4,Very interesting,Very interesting interruptions of the Greek stories. Rounds out my Jim Henson collection very nicely. Must have for the Storyteller collection.
5,Darker than the first,"Four episodes with a new Storyteller. Join him and the dog as they wander through Greek ruins and tell the stories they know of the places. These stories are much darker and more adult than the first set of Russian stories we all know and love from the Jim Henson Hour, but still fantastic and worth the price."
3,entertaining but...,"I enjoyed this movie alot, mainly because I've been interested in the greek myths since I was a kid. For my kids this was a pretty scary movie, especially the minotaur. I would not recommend it for little ones. Plus, it was a lot shorter than the other Storyteller DVD."
4,Wonderful way to keep the stories alive,"Theseus, Perseus, Orpheus, Daedalus - I'd really rather hear a kid talking about these guys than Pikachu or Kim Possible. Okay, maybe it won't happen, but not for lack of an entertaining, well-made presentation. These are truly enjoyable.Jim Henson's crew has put together an outstanding made-for-TV series. They play with the lines between puppetry and costume, with bits of animation thrown in, though not as much as in Dark Crystal or Labyrinth. There's plenty of drama, too, maybe a bit much for the very youngest children. These stories, in their day, were for adults, though. I'm glad to see that they haven't been disneyfied into inanity.I have to admit, I liked the DVD of fairy tales from The Storyteller better. These are good, though, and a great way to bring old stories to today's new media.//wiredweird"
2,Why so expensive?,"I checked this DVD out from my local library and enjoyed it so much, I wanted to give it to my nephew who is learning ancient history and Greek myths. But why does it cost so much-- $97+ new or $46+ used?I think I'll just tell him to pick it up at the library."
5,Definitive source on British knighthood,"Considering the publisher of this work, it must be regarded as the ""official"" complete list (up to 1906). Volume 1 contains the preeminent orders -- Garter, Bath, Victorian Order, etc. -- each list being chronological and providing full names and dates of all persons invested, so far as information was available. (It seems astonishing that the registers of the Order of the Thistle, which began in 1687, were lost c1830 and not rediscovered until the turn of this century!)Volume 2 is a chronological list of knights bachelors -- ""ordinary"" knights -- from the introduction of the Angevin dubbing ceremony c1250. Shaw's articulate essays on each order, and on the system of knights bachelors (and why most fief-holders didn't want to join), provide an antidote to American confusion on this subject."
3,Battery powered cleaner,"Cleaning your tank without changing the water is a very efficient way to keep it clean and maintain a healthy inviroment. This cleaner provides everything nessecary, the handling is good, everything fits and works, it is doing it's job.The not so nice thinks about it: It's a little weak - the pump is not sucking very powerful in a 50 gal. tank (I have seen better!), it takes just a long time to clean. And the cleaning head for walls is just a joke, not working at all - but I like the idea!"
1,Made in china!,Not a very well made product. The batteries chamber flooded before our fish tank was even emptied. Don't buy it if you have a big tank.
1,"Broke in less than a month,","Do not buy this thing. Mine only worked twice. Even when it did work, it was really difficult to use, esp with low water levels like a turtle set up."
1,Does a very poor job!,"Pump is very weak, does not pick up most dirt. Rotor gets clogged quickly with algea.I would NOT recommend this product."
1,Not a good buy!,In my opinion this product is a waste of money. The components are made very cheap and the product does not maintain enough suction unless you frequently replace the batteries. The tube doesn't easily remain extended. I had to modify it with masking tape around the bottom to get powerful suction. Effort not worth the result.
2,What?,"Ok, so I am really dissappointed with this product. I thought it was a syphon so I assumed it would come with the hose. Nope it doesn't. It comes with a little ""bag"" that looks and feels like a toddlers sock. This thing is all plastic and doesnt fit well together. I really wish I wouldn't have purchased this item as I wanted it to me used as a water syphon too, which it can't because of no freakin hose!"
4,works,"Good: fits the Miata, easy to use, provides shape, provides protection (I have crack in my rear plastic window), lightweight, packs up to the size of a small football for storage, low priceBad: not strong or durable enough to survive a violent Florida thunderstorm. I've had one rip from the high winds. Adaquate performance for the price though..."
2,Not enough,"I read the back of this video and picked it up, because it appealed to me. A special girl? A hero? However, I felt disappointed, as if the story was incomplete. It wasn't as though I was unsatisfied with the story itself, but so much more could have been done with this and it seemed as though the writers simply stopped midway.The characters have potential and this story could have been made into a sequal. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother buying this--too pointless."
1,Do judge a book by its cover,I haven't bought or read this book. I am an art director and would not buy a book about graphic design that has such a horribly ugly cover. It makes me sad on the inside.
1,Do not buy this book!,"This book is horrible! A blind, armless monkey could come up with better graphic designs than the author! Just look at the cover. My eyes are bleeding."
2,People say you shouldn't judge a book by its cover...,"This is yet another book aimed at the education market for educators who don't seem to understand the very subject that they're teaching. The author does show some understanding of core graphic design concepts early on in the book. Unfortunately I don't feel that the author knows how to actually implement good graphic design. Another really major flaw with the book is that she tries to cover web design and electronic media. Unfortunately it doesn't seem like she has a lot of experience in anything but print. A lot of that content regarding electronic media is just incorrect. Sadly I feel that most people who buy this book won't have a choice, since it's aimed for (crappy) art school curriculums."
1,Terrible.,"The Typography on the cover is bad. It use cliche fonts, and breaks the basic rules of typography. The contrast in the colors is also bad to the point that color blind people cant read it. It is all around bad. Don't do buy it. If you want a good design book check out Ellen Lupton's books."
3,Should be 5 - but new it's too expensive,"This is a great book, and as a former design educator, I always encouraged my students to look into this book. The basics of the practice are excellently covered. However most students balked at the price. Buy it used if you can. The Web chapter is really dated now."
5,"The art of verbal slapstick, it is fading in the era of verbally crude humor","The Marx Brothers movies are some of the best demonstrations of verbal slapstick ever written and delivered. In this book, some of the best frames from their movies, Cocoanuts, Monkey Business, Horse Feathers, Duck Soup, A Night at the Opera, A Day At the Races, At the Circus, Go West and The Big Store are presented. The dialogue associated with the still is included and from it, you can get some of the feel for the verbal bantering that takes place between the characters. While it is impossible for any combination of stills and text to truly capture the action in a Marx Brothers movie, this book comes as close as possible. Reading this book will make you want to rent their movies and watch them once again."
3,A compendium of their funniest moments.,"There is only so much that can be put together and rehashed before it becomes boring to even the most ardent of fans. This book is a compilation of some of their funniest moments in their movies including the famous 'why a duck' scene from 'The Cocoanuts' This book is for the avid Marx Brothers fan who wants to have their famous moments in writing. I was disappointed that it had nothing more than script segments that I already have in other books. Buy this book as a first in your collection, not to finish a collection off."
5,Timesaver for necessary task,"I have had one of these for three years. Use it regularly on truck, 2 cars, and yard equipment. I think it is an outstanding little unit. The hoses fit well if you are paying attention and don't allow them to slip off the nipples. If the oil is too hot they will do that. I have a clothespin which I use to mark the depth of the dipstick on the hose I insert into the engine. This allows me to push the tube down into the engine and be just short of the depth of the oil pan. Then I start the suction. At first sign of air, I carefully push the tube down another inch or so until I feel it strike the oil pan, then I leave it until it pulls all the oil.For storage I clip the tube (with the clothespin) up high to my garage door track. The oil in the tube runs down into the receiver. Then I coil it up and store it in the box."
2,"Production is good, the change of style is weak!","Lil Cuete's first release, There's Only One Way About It, was definately a good album despite the lack of lyricism and creativity. His new cd, Unforgettable, really doesn't do much for his career, if anything it destroys his reputation as an original Chicano rapper. He changes his style too much into a Lil Rob sound alike. It's not his voice, even thought at times it can sound like Lil Rob, it's his flow. If you're a fan of Lil Rob you will definately like this but if you liked the first Lil Cuete cd and are expecting something like that but alot more better, you're not going to find it here."
1,DON'T BUY IT!,These kids just know how to ruin Feel Good Inc. The adults singing it sound drunk. The kids' voices sound electronic. Some of these lyrics really aren't child appropiate. AND HOW DO YOU RYHME FAST CATS WITH FAST CATS?!Little kids should get the trashy high school musical soundtrack. Or some Disney soundtrack. What normal parent would buy this trash for their kid?! This thing doesn't deserve 1 star. It deserves none.
1,:'(,"Would all of you please bow your heads down in respect for the original songwriters now. We have gathered here today to remember and charish the good times with the original versions of these songs. Even though we may not like some of the originals, we can still feel sorry for the poor artists who now have one less hit because of Kidz Bop."
1,I'M SO DISSAPOINTED!!!!!!!!111,HEY! I WANTED LIDDEL KIDZ TO SING DEM FRANCHISE BOYS TUNES. AND LAFFY TAFFY. AND SOME MY HUMPS! AND GRILLZ! COME ON KIDZ BOP! KIDZ SHOULD LEARN TO SING MORE GANSTER RAP AND BECOME RAPPERS AT THE AGE OF 6! YAY! THEY NEED TO START SINGING SOME MORE PERVERTED STUFF! HIGH 5 PARENTS! I WANT TO HEAR LITTLE KIDS SING ABOUT THEIR GRILLZ AND THEIR LOVELY LADY HUMPS! YAY!
1,Kidz Bop BRATZ,"On KB10, the Kidz Bop Bratz killed Madonna's ""Hung Up"". Because of this, they must die. I doubt they even know who Madonna is, much less the song where the sample comes from. I long for the day when Kidz Bop is derailed, crashes, rolls down a cliff, and then is decimated by an 18-wheeler. I'm not going into the songs on here, but I will say this: they suck really badly. Thank you, and have a pleasant day.THIS PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO YOU BY THE FOUNDATION FOR BETTER MUSIC."
1,I can't believe this series is still popular,"After 9 albums, I can't believe Kidz Bop is still at it. I understand that the point of the series is to give kids music that is free of obscene language but c'mon. These kids who sings on these wretched cds are totally devoid of any singing abilities. Get some profession studio musicians who CAN sing and play instruments and sing the clean lyrics, don't have a bunch of tone deaf children massacre songs by Gorillaz and Green Day. If there is an after life, I can only imagine that in Hades, the devil will be playing this garbage incessantly to torture those who couldn't get into heaven. Whoever came up with the idea that kids with no tone pitch singing popular songs needs to be locked in a room and be forced to listen to all nine cds on repeat."
4,Relax and just enjoy,"Some of these ""critics"" should just chill out. These CDs were not put out to win a Grammy. So what if they're not sung by the original. These are made by kids to entertain kids and my 3 and 5 yr girls LOVE IT! So do their friends when they come over. They all sing along and dance around to the music. If you want to hear the original, buy the original."
1,kidz bop-funny but sucks,"Okay, all kidzbops suck, they always will, and always have. Now that we've established that this is a hillarious album. For Photograph they replace ""This is where I went to school... criminal record says I broke in twice..."" ""This is where I went to school... school record says I was late twice..."". Unintentional comedy at its best. No, but seriously do not buy this album. Just because it is funny does not mean you should support kidzbop. I dont know how they can afford to make these albums."
1,"Cuts and pastes ""Get the originals"" from other Kidz Bop reviews","Okay, this is the worst one yet (which really doesn't matter much since they are all abysmal). Why? Because YOU DON""T SING AXEL F OR FEEL GOOD INC, and all of the other songs, minus the Green Day are all crap.No 2006 music is worth hearing, nor will that ever be true. Just don't support Kidz Bop. Hasn't that sunk in by now? Oh wait, its 2K6, where crap is abundant. D4L is better, and that's saying something.Go buy Tool, Alice in Chains, or A Perfect Circle if you wanna hear good music. Later."
3,"Good, but not exellent.","Okay, i saw this at the library, picked it up, and copied some songs on my Windows Media Player. It's hillarious hearing the Kidz Bop kids trying to sing a song that was originally by a frog (Axel F). But their version of 'Pon De Replay' was really bad, but i like ""Listen To Your Heart', i'll just look for the original songs on the Windows Media guide (I own Axel F). So please save your money and buy CDs by the original artists.(Crazy Frog, Gorillaz, etc.)"
1,I think my ears are bleeding.,this stupid cd is horrible I DONT EVEN HAVE IT all i had to do was listen to the samples to hate it. lol. DONT BUY IT it sucks all this is trying to do is manipulate little kids into listening to music that they shouldnt even be listening to. bottom line dont buy it.
1,Horrible!,"This CD DEFINITELY deserves a negative rating. And I don't mean just a bad rating, though that certainly applies as well. I mean a NEGATIVE NUMBER. It's DREADFUL. The real Green Day would probably all commit suicide if they ever heard this travesty of Wake Me Up When September Ends! The first time I heard it, I literally wanted to puke! And that is saying quite a lot, as I'm not generally too picky about songs, singers, or even mediocre remakes of songs that I already know a far superior version of."
1,Ughhh!,I hate Kidz Bop! They ruined my favorite songs. They definaly ruined Axel F for sure. It be good with out the d@mn kids!
3,Not great- But Kids love it,"I thought this would be a great idea..because I have a fondness of pop music...and the kids seem to love it! Unfortunatley, the way the songs were redone really is awful for adults listening..but for some reason..the kids love it and I suppose that is what they were going for. I have to say..this is better than listening to Disney Radio or Disney songs..."
1,Gah!,"I can't believe that they have made it to Volume 9. The songs on the Kidz Bop compilations are sung by a bunch of uninspired spoon-fed children who butcher SOMEWHAT decent to mediocre songs (depending on which songs they decide to destroy). Their commercials consist of the kids running around laughing and dancing, while lipsynching. Wow, the perfect nightmare!Remember when Alvin and the Chipmunks used to cover songs? Yeah, well, KIDZ BOP is worse than Alvin and his Chipmunk friends will ever be! Ashlee Simpson can sing better than these kids can!By the time the newest Kidz Bop CD hits stores, most of the songs (by the ORIGINAL artists) are overplayed on MTV and radio. Kidz Bop needs to die. Besides, most of the time, they take songs that ALREADY suck, and add more suck factor to them, and the result is an abomination. Do the kids of today a favor by buying them a Beatles CD, or maybe a soundtrack to a Disney film, anything is better than Kidz Bop!"
3,These discs serve their purpose very well. Think clearly.,"I am an adult, with children ages five and seven. My own taste in music runs along the indie vein, and so I dislike all the songs on this series just on principle. However, these discs have KIDS singing on them, and this appeals to KIDS. SMALL kids. Those who love the original songs and feel scarred by these renditions should save themselves the grief and stay far, far away from these discs."
1,I hate it!,"Take it from a middle schooler. This cd is one of the worst ever! It is targeted to elementary students, but conatins songs that teenagers listen to. The lyrics are inapropriate for small children. Kids bop changes the lyrics to the songs to sell them to little kids, but it just messes up the whole thing. The way they sing is enough to give me a migrange! In short never ever buy any kids bop cds, and if I could I would boycott them."
1,Take it from a kid,"Okay, I am in fourth grade, and I have a sister in 8th grade. I really think that this music series is awful, and these kids have no idea what the themes are in the songs they sing. My sister listens to some of these songs, and she agrees that they aren't suitable for younger kids to be singing. Moms and Dads, if you want to get your kids something fun and contemporary, please don't buy this! Buy them an Aly and AJ CD. Their music sounds like ""big kid"" music, but it doesn't have the bad words/themes. You could even buy them a High School Musical soundtrack. I'm pretty sure my choices are much better alternatives than Kids Bop."
1,piece of trash!,Who in their right mind buys this stuff?Any sane person wouldn't buy this.They can't sing and all these dumb little kids sound like rats trying to sing.They keep turning great songs into a bunch of noise.I wish they would stop making trash like this and trying to sell it.Its not worth the time or money.All the songs on here suck!I hope it gets discontinued.This is probably the worst cd ever made.Their voices are so aggravating and make you want to punch something.Kids Bop is the worst thing that ever happened in the music bussiness.These dumb little rats need to get a hobby and leave singing to the professionals.
4,nice cd,there are some nice songs. My daughter like Crazy Frog. Didn't appeal to me as an adult. I guess it is a good cd for the kids. not enough dance songs I think.
1,uggggggggg this sucked,"This cd sucked eggs. my advice DO NOT BUY IT. Just get the normal songs off of i-tunes of something just don't buy it.on feel good inc. they didn't even get the words right. and on some of the other songs sounded like they were screaming in the back round and most of them could not sing.this cd is a total waste of money I couldn't even listen to most of the songs through once it was pretty bad. DON""T BUY"
3,Good read,"This book is a fictional extension of the story of Elijah from the bible. In my opinion it was a bit emotional, but is packed with many life lessons, including one that I had just recently discovered from reading a book by Iyanla Vanzant. This lesson is that if you do not make a choice, you will live by default. In this book by Coelho, Elijah had trouble making a choice, therefore God made the choice for him and hence, Elijah had to live with the consequences of that choice. It was a good book. Paulo also was able to make references to some of the characters in his other books. I was only able to pick up on 2 as I have only read 2 other of his books, not including this one. A reference was made to The Alchemist as well as to Warrior Of The Light."
3,Probably not his best work...,"The Fifth Mountain is a fictionalized account of the prophet Elijah's time between the rasing of the dead Phoenican boy to his return to Israel and the showdown with the Baalist priests. The story revolves around the struggle with God's will, the challenges of following a sacred mission, and the need for self-sacriice in fulfilling a mission.Of the 8 of Coelho's books I read to date, this one was probably the one that least moved me at any level. The storyline itself was OK, and the concept of the divine struggle and exile and acceptance were OK as well. However, I had become accustomed to much deeper messages from Paulo Coehlo, and this one really failed to deliver that ""ah ha"" moment.A decent read, and you probably will want to read it if you are a Coelho fan, but I would not classify this by any stretch as his best work."
3,"It has its poetic moments, but it failed to enchant me","PROS:- Simple writing style, flows well.- Lots of dialog- A few profound lessons- Excellent for young adultsCONS:- If you're a bit cynical, you won't like it. You'll feel it's cheesy.- May make some people believe it's tightly based on the Bible (it's not)CONCLUSION: Coelho has written better books. Try those. If you're a huge fan of his, then you'll like this."
1,No pierdan el tiempo con esta porqueria,"Nuevamente, Coelho nos demuestra sin tapujos lo que es su principal interes. Ganar dinero con literatura barata y facilista destinada para dar a oir lo que se quiere oir sin compromiso, con una llanura mental rampante. Lastima de los arboles cortados para hacer el papel en el que se imprimio esta basura."
1,the fifth candy mountain,"Forrest Gump rewrites the Old Testament and it's kind of like a box of chocolates: once in a while you might find a little kernel of nourishment, but long before then you will have gagged on all the sticky sweetness"
3,"Fans of ""THE ALCHEMIST"" - Prepare to be underwhelmed","Readers of Coelho's other books will miss his usual ""magic"" in this title. While the first two-thirds of the story will intrigue you, by the end Elijah has become a contemporary New Age guru. The strength of the author's earlier titles was his storytelling. Let's hope Coelho bounces back with a original story of his own and leaves the retelling of the Bible to others."
2,"Great idea, poor execution.","Coelho had a wonderful idea--a fictional account of Elijah to give us more insight into the life of a fabulous and not widely known Old Testament Prophet. Unfortunately, Coelho's execution of the idea is poor. The story is often silly, he attributes to Elijah thoughts that are not in the Old Testament and are often directly at odds with it, but there are gems of wisdom and occasionally good writing. Curiously, the most important part of Elijah's life--his confrontation with the priests of Baal on Mt. Carmel--is avoided entirely and dealt with only by quoting the Old Testament. His death and ascent to heaven, the second most important element of Elijah's life, isn't dealt with at all. This book could have been so good, but unfortunately, it isn't."
2,A let down,"I was very disappointed. I wouldn't mind if somebody would take a story from the Bible, create something new and interesting, but this was just not good. Coelho drifted so far away from the story that it totally distorted the character of Elijah as he is known in the Bible. I found this whole romance thing boring and the story line was just weak. What irritated me the most is this whole 'wrestling with God' kinda business. This is not Jacob's story, this is Elijah. I do not recommend this book."
3,Don't start here ....,"I have never read a Coelho book and was eager to read The Fifth Mountain. I selected this book over Coelho's more popular Alchemist because it did receive strong reviews and support from its readers. I was disappointed.The book failed to move me and I found none of the passion that I anticipated. The story moved slowly and I never felt a part of it, nor a friend of the characters, not even Elijah.My lack of enthusiasm suggests I might have been better off introducing myself to Coelho with The Alchemist. I have no doubt that he is a master at his trade, but The Fifth Mountain did not inspire me to read additional Coelho books."
2,Didn't like it!,"I read the first 105 pages and I need to say it was not entertaining at all, even if there were some real wise and good sentences sometimes. I wrote these sentences down and this was it. After the 105th page (approx.) I stopped. No, this is not the way I see it. The Assyrian got killed and somehow it gave the impression that god is only there for the prophets like Eliah and the ""chosen ones"". But god is there for everyone(!), this book is more of a hero story and the other people don't count. No, this is not the way I see it."
1,C Diaz,We purchased this product through Amazon and we have had nothing but problems since. The wine cooler arrived missing one of the leveling legs. Once we had it set up the bottom portion would not cool. We contacted the manufacturer and they sent out a service man and he determined it could not be repaired. We contacted Haier and we were told to clip so much of the electrical cord and peal the stickers off the back and send these items to Haier certified mail. Once they receive it they will ship us a new machine. We have now found out they won't be replacing it and are now offering us a refund excluding our original shipping costs. I will never purchase another Haier product since they are not able to stand behind their products.
1,Haier is absolutely horrible. Never buy Haier again,Under warranty and broken foer the past 4 months. Warranty service undable to fix after 5 service calls. Haier wants a sixth service call. Your time is not worth anything to them as the service calls are 4 hour windows (2 of 5 service calls ended up outside of the 4 hours window). Avoid Haier at all costs! Not worth the price!!!
1,Avoid at all costs,"I just spend an hour tearing apart this HVTB40DPABS MODEL looking for a reason as to why it won't cool as advertised. As far as my wife and I are concerned, this $275 investment was a total loss writeoff, don't risk spoiling your expensive wines.DO NOT PURCHASE! Read all of the reviews, stay away from this Made in China product!"
1,Avoid This Product,"Within 6 months of using this product, the unit stopped holding its temperature, eventually being over 10 degrees higher than the thermostat. Then the product stopped working altogether with something burning out on the control board. Haier's customer service was useless - when I asked them for a repair center in my area, I was told to Google it. Do yourself a favor and stay clear of this product. Based on my experience and those of the other reviewers, I would avoid all Haier products."
1,Haier Is Creating a Horrible Reputation,"I bought this wine cellar as a gift 2 years ago. It is already having trouble maintaining the wine temperature. On top of that, the service at Haier is really unprofessional. Their products start having issues within a year just in time for the warranty to expire. I called about getting serviced and they referred me to All-State Appliance Service that basically ripped us off and gave us the run around. They vacuumed out the back of the fridge and charged us $180. BIG DEAL! I could have done that myself. It did not fix the problem and then the company decided to give us the run around about giving us our money back. Now I am trying to locate parts and they are all sold out. What now? Landfill probably!"
1,Dog treats,"I did get a good laugh out of my one bone that I had ordered thinking I was getting a cute basket of bones for the 130.49 value .So do not let the picture deceive you as It did me.SO this item is so not worth it .Merrick Smoked Beefy Jerky Bone 2-3"""
3,Not the best,My dog finished it very quickly. Was not enough to keep him satisfied chewing. Its a short treat but not much for the money.
2,not good enough,i wanted something that had enough meat so my mini schnauzer would want to bite on it however i needed something that could entice him to chew on this rather than my apartment. THis bone was not the solution. There is practically no meat on this bone and after two minutes of chewing he lost interest in it. I threw it away after the first week snce he never touched it again.
2,Bone,"I was very disapointed with this item.It does not look like the photo shown,In fact when it came I thought they had made a mistake.The only (good?)thing about this thing is it is indestructable.Make sure it is put away after it has been chewed? on,hitting your toes on this in the middle of the night might cause you to throw it across a room."
2,Pretending Gay to Z,"This dvd would have been much better if the intimate parts were filmed differently. Its obvious the actors are pretending to have intimate relations. That obviousness doesn't add anything to this production. They also linger too long on those scenes. If this was to be done as an ""art"" film then the artist lacks some talent in presenting the subject matter. Its like a race car movie where the actors are pretending to drive a race car compared to the same movie where the driver is actually driving the car, the difference is obvious and make all the difference in entertainment value. If you want a movie where you see good looking men nude (this is not a XXX movie), where they pretend to do stuff you can actually see them do in other productions, then this is the movie for you. My recommendation is spend your money on something else. I give it 2 stars because some of the guys are worth looking at even if they are not aroused."
1,Gay to Z of Sex.,"This is a boring trashly produced gay film about the ""bird and the bees,"" of the gay life style. All sex scene are simultated by probably ""straight"" (non-gay) actors, yikes! I RATED THE FILM 1 LONELY STAR, FOR THE EFFORT IT TOOK TO DEVELOPE THE FILM!Not worth seeing once, thumbs down on this gay flick!"
2,"All sheet, no ghost...","This lavish-looking French production, while it does provide simmering atmosphere by the kettle-full, falls well short in the story department, substituting fill-in-the-blank visual cliche (treading heavily on del Toro's turf in particular) for narrative/dramatic cohesion at nearly every turn. Dialogue and acting are also subpar. It reminded me, as such, of Anthony Hickox's 2010 'Knife Edge,' another attractive but creatively malnourished Euro-natural potboiler. Sumptuous photography and creepy setting distinguish what otherwise might pass for a long, mildly intriguing video-game demo. 2-plus stars."
3,A bad dream where everyone acts strangely and not to social standards,"This movie was entitled Saint Ange when I saw it and I watched it because of Virginia Ledoyen. No one says the expected niceties in this movie which is why it feels exactly a bad dream. I didn't even notice that the movie was especially well-shot or designed. I had to look this movie up on the internet and then rewatch it because it was not clear to me who the ghost children were. Once I knew who the ghost children were, then the movie meant something totally different than just an exercise in making the audience feel uncomfortable and unhappy; after knowing, then its about how horrifying what transpired, the pain and terror unimaginable when we read about it. We don't understand what really happened and it is impossible for the victims to ever convey so it's about getting away with murder and social/Christian hypocrisy as represented by Virginia Ledoyen's taboo pregnancy by rape."
2,don't waste your money,This movie was a huge disappointment. Nothing made sense. Nothing resolved. not at all scary. Don't waste your money.
4,LeBra the total Miracle to Bugs and Stones,"Great fitting product that keeps rock chips off the front end and also keeps bugs out of the radiator and air conditioner condenser, and looks great on my 2011 Impala."
5,wonderful romantic suspense,"LikeBlue FlameandWhite Heat, Seeing Red is a 5-star read. It's the last of Jill Shalvis's firefighters, if I remember correctly. This would make me unbearably sad, but the stories have had so much more going on than just firefighting, I'm certain whatever she writes next will be just as compelling.This is also a reunion story, and anyone who's familiar with me knows how much I like those. There's just something about characters who've known each other a long time.The heroine left town and her best friend Joe after her father was killed in a warehouse fire. She returns home years later when there's another fire at that same warehouse and finds that Joe's a fire marshal. Both of them are emotionally scarred.The emotional journey could easily have taken a back seat to the twists and turns and drama of the mystery, or vice versa. But both sides of the story are equally intense and neither is short-changed. It's just a really good romantic suspense, with equal parts of both."
4,powerpuff professor,"easy to read chapter book about the powerpuff girls. the book describes how the professor wants to spend more time with the girls, but they keep getting called out to save the world. in his quest for more quality time, the professor invents a superhero suit for himself to wear. he goes out fighting battles with the girls. at first the girls are thrilled that he is there, but they quickly get tired of him being a bigger superhero then they are. they come up with a clever way to stop the professor."
4,Gotta hear it - it's the hot s**t!!!,"This cd will ""break your neck""! First track called ""Just Bounce"" has a potential to become a street, or even mainstream hit. Wize did a great job on this one, and Natural featured in this song is my personal favorite. Next three tracks are hot as well (especially 2nd and 4th). I'm not a big fan of latin rap so ""Moveo De Lao a Lao"" is not my favorite, opposite to ""Sugar Honey Ice Tea"" which is just great. Witty lirics of Big Texxx in ""Gotta get me a gun"", and beautiful deep voice of Paige Moody in ""I've got what you need"" are leading to not as good ""Dime Ma"". And then... The brilliant beat and chorus in ""Rebel War Riders"" are making it one of the hottest songs on the album. The last potential hit is ""Let me find out"" with great flow of Natural, and the classic hip hop beat. Generally - you have to check this album - it's HOT, and I think we'll hear a lot more about Indiggo Child productions soon."
1,"Good news, bad news","The good news - I can say to those who ask that I have read a Friedman novel. The bad news - it was terrible. a total waste of the time reading it. Kinky's sytle gets old very quickly. A little of the author goes a long way. One star at best,"
4,Ray Bradbury fan,"My all time favorite book has been Martin Chronicles, so this is a very great surprise for me, to read several essays from different experts. And learn more about such classic.And it doesn't end there, they analyze more of his stories. I don't know if Mr. Bradbury will agree on this book, but it did enlight me."
5,a Great Tribute,"Burt Bacharach is truly one of the Most Gifted Musicians,composers.He truly undersstands feeling&Depth with what he does Musically.the Artists here truly capture the tones,vibe&understanding of where Burt Bacharach was getting at.these Songs are some of the Greatest Ever composed&performed.Props to Hal David for Co-Writing with Burt Bacharach."
4,Decent Book,"This is a very decent book that will most definitely help one with their written vocabulary/grammar skills.As mentioned, it does waste a lot of space with huge drawings. Furthermore, it also occasionally use words that have not yet been introduced. It is necessary to either be willing on occasion to figure things out based on context or have a French->English dictionary handy. However, exercise caution if using a dictionary since that foreign word could be something introduced in a previous chapter but simply wasn't stressed."
2,Planned obsolescence--buyer beware,"Bought this fax/phone/answering maching/copier which comes with six-month warranty. At eight months the phone message function began break down. I would be calling in for messages and it would disconnect abruptly every fourth or fifth time. I would call back and retrieve the remainder of my messages. After a year, the answering machine function would abruptly disconnect when clients were leaving messages. Again, this would happen about 25 percent of the time. This is true planned obsolescence. My AT&T; answering machine has lasted 8 years with no problems. My Brother fax/copier/answering machine/copier has lasted 9 years with no problems. So perhaps it's Panasonic's poor workmanship.Buy Beware."
4,:),"This is the fourth book out of the five book series. Alex Marchetti of the famous Marchetti restraunt family is in no way looking for a woman. Alex has suffered through the loss of one woman and does not want to go through it again. Unfortunately he can not help but feel attracted to Fran Carlino. Fran is helping Alex with a new line of frozen foods. Once Fran and Alex mix business with pleasure the sparks start to fly. Very interesting how their story plays out. This is just a short fun story. Honestly, I might not have enjoyed it as much if I was not reading the whole series."
3,Good for toddlers or younger children,"This book is simple and encouraging for the very young child. Amazon has a note that this is for the child up to age 8, but a school age child, other than kindergartener, would find it disappointing. This helps dispell fears of the toddler, young child group of losing their parents somehow with divorce. It addresses that they have a place and home with each parent which helps a young child adjust to divorce in the family. For the younger child, it is worth the cost. For the older child, look for a different book like Dinosaurs Divorce which addresses more feelings and complex issues."
4,"Alex has two homes, two sets of friends, two styles of life","Alex's Mommy and Daddy don't live together anymore and so Alex shares time with them in two different homes. He has his own room in each, his own toothbrush, his own favorite chair, and his own special times with Mommy and Daddy. Through the simple illustrations of Kady MacDonald Denton and the comforting words of the author, Claire Masurel, this book reassures the young child that despite the separation in his family, he is very much loved by both parents. This book is good for the younger child for whom 'divorce' is not easy to comprehend. It can help a child understand more the impact of sharing homes as well as parents."
5,My daughter loves it.,"Good book for little ones suffering through divorce. I wish there were more books like this, as much comfort as my daughter takes in this one and Dinasaurs Divorce."
5,Great,"Simple yet effective, my little guy is just realizing that he has two homes and this reinforced that his mother and I both love and care for him where ever he is."
4,Very nice book,This is a very nice simple book great for children. I would recommend this to my friends. Very nice book.
3,What if...,"I am not a parent, I am a step parent (very new by the way) and I bought this book for the kids for whenever they get to visit us, I found very idealistic and probably not reliable for all type of cases, what if one of the parents or both of them are not doing what they are supposed to, like, for example, maintaining a friendly relationtship for the sake of the kids? This book is for those cases where both parents are doing an excellent job in being a divorce parents, I guess we all love that image."
4,"Short, but to the point","If you're divorced/separated and your child visits two homes, it's a cool book that a child (my son is 5) can relate to. He has the same thing in two different houses. Different bed, different friends, different everything and different ways of doing things, but the main premise is that he's loved whereever he goes."
4,Great book for younger children,I love the way the books depicts that the child actually has two homes now; not concentrating on the fact that they come from a broken home. My 6-year old granddaughter loves this book and talks about the apartment she shares with her Mom as her first home and the one she visits her Dad as her second home.
5,Great for Toddler/Preschoolers,I bought this book for my 3 1/2 yr old. It is simple and makes having two homes seem more positive. My daughter points out the toothbrush at Daddy's and the one at Mommy's. Good book to start with for toddler/preschool age.
4,good message,"This was a good book for my 5 yr old Grandson. It was a great way to show that other children live in split family situations; most importantly--it reminds the reader that the child is still loved by BOTH parents, and still freely loves BOTH parents in return."
4,Comforting & easily understood by very little ones,"My 4 year old granddaughter asks to be read this book. It is helping her understand moving from one home to the other much better. When it is time to leave, she repeats to us that she has two homes. Very grateful for the simple presentation of a difficult reality that is so clearly understood by my little one. She still hates to leave one home to go to the other but does so with less tears."
5,Such a wonderful book for such a difficult transition,"I can't say enough good things about this book... it is exactly the kind of message that a young child needs to hear when parents split up. I bought it for my nearly-three-year-old when he began spending overnights at his dad's house, and he frequently requests it. I'm now buying another copy for him to keep at his dad's place."
1,No description,"I was referred to the book and got a general description there but what the heck? No description on Amazon, how are people to know what it is about? My rating is for Amazon no the book"
2,Disappointing,"More memoir then handbook for masters running. If you are looking for training plans or tips skip this book and look elsewhere. Tips and plans saved for last 15 pages have to read through 194 pages of Mr. HHigdon's running and medical history before getting to anything resempling plans. Advice boils down to (1) run consistantly but not every day, and (2) strength train."
1,"title very misleading, more a series of reminisces...","I wanted facts and how-to's, but this book is 99% a series of looks back at Hal Higdon's past (many of which I've read in other publications). Other than a few charts for running/walking/all combos of for full and half marathons, there's nothing in here to help the over 40 (or under 40, for that matter) runner progress. Very, very disappointing book. If it weren't for the hassles of returning things from Canada, this puppy would have gone back to amazon.com immediately."
1,not helpful for beginner,"Like another reviewer said, this reads like a memoir. Someone who is already a longtime competitive runner might really enjoy reading as the author reflects upon a long and accomplished career. However, there was almost nothing in the book that was helpful to me, an older beginner runner. The actual information given on training, injuries etc was minimal."
2,disapointed,I bought this book looking for a training programs for the average master runner. It seems to be an autobiography of Mr.Higdon and his competition. Were not all superior runners.
1,read it once - never again,Comes across as an egotistical review of his own life - the passage about running into his old high school girlfriend and how she told him how great he looked is typical. No real advice for a masters runner. If I could remember where I had put this I would have thrown it out by now.Avoid.
5,Phenomenal soundtrack!,Great dance songs! The show was great and I have been collecting on the sound tracks now. A great addition to you collection.
5,Awesome,Finally I bought the last cd from this awesome TV show. I will never forget it. It's very dancing and the hits are fabulous.
3,It's the final one!,"QAF: The Final Season CD is good, but not great. The Season One & Two CD's are the best. This CD has a few remake songs on it that were'nt needed. The song, Free by Ultra Nate, is on the Club Babylon CD which has a longer/better version of FREE than on the QAF Final Season CD. There's a remake of Fever. Why? There's a remake of Personal Jesus. There's a remake of Proud (from Season One) but it's understandable if you watched the show. If you have the QAF Season 1-4 music CD's, then it's great for your collection ... it is the final one."
2,At least one MISSING TRACK!,"I'm sure this compilation is great. I will not purchase it, however, because I am disappointed! I am very upset to learn that a key song from Season 5 is missing from this CD. The closing song from Episode 504 is NOT on this CD. (Joint Is Jumpin') They played Joint Is Jumpin' during the final 4 minutes of Episode 504. I was certain it would appear on this soundtrack. Tower Records even had this track listed as one of the tracks, but the song does not end up on the soundtrack. Needlesstosay, I am saddened about this fact."
5,A Charming Celebration of Our Feathered Friends,"I only learned of the existence of this film a few weeks ago, when a parrot group I'm a member of showed it to its membership. I missed the showing, so went to Amazon and picked it up.This film is completely eye-opening and completely charming. I know it's a kids movie but I think most grown-ups would enjoy seeing it, just because it must have taken the film-makers years to get the birds to perform as well as they do. (Of course, these birds may have been so well-trained that they did it all on the first take!)My only regret is that it appears that the VHS copies now in circulation were duplicated from an old old print. This print is by no means unwatchable, but gets very dark during the crucial fire-rescue scene. If there's ever been a good candidate for digital restoration, Bill and Coo is it!"
1,terrible quality,"This dvd is so dark you can hardly see anything. i have this on vhs, and it is old and well-used. But the tape is 100 times clearer and brighter than the new dvd! i can't believe someone is actually charging the high premium prices they are for this terrible copy. This is not worth 1$, let alone the premium price i was charged. Unwatchable! I could have made a better copy myself! Very disappointed!"
4,good movie,"To whom it may conern,It was a good movie But they could show a litle more of each other and in stead of in between scene and lese talking. But it was a good movie.Thank you Peter"
2,Mad about The Boy,If you are looking for Hugh Grant in this stinker you have sadly wasted your money.

4,Wireless Desktop 3000,I can no longer type on a regular keybaord. Since the first ergonomic keyboard from Microsoft about 10 years ago. I also have the Microsfot natural ergonomic keyboard 4000. This is outstanding for for when you have to type a lot.The 3000 is thin with the right amount of extra funtion keys for gettting you email and launchine your web browser and working your volume mute feature for the media players.I can sit back in my chair and put the 3000 on my lap and type away. The wireless mouse has the new tilt wheel which lets you scroll left and right on large web pages and other windows like a large word document that cannot be displayed in the window because of large text.It's been about 3 months since I purchased the 3000 and I still have the batteries (that came with the KB and mouse). Microsoft has come a long way in regaurds to battery life in their mice and keyboard. 6 months or longer is not uncommon. The SOFT feel of the half hight keys if very comforting.
4,Works well with Windows and Mac,"I've used this keyboard/mouse set for a while. The keyboard feels sturdy (i.e. not cheap), and the mouse tracks well and has a nice scroll wheel. The driver software works well on Windows, and acceptably on the Mac (it is definitely not as polished as the Windows version). Be warned, though, that since the keyboard and mouse use the same receiver the set is not going to work with a KVM switch (or at least with the IOGEAR one I tried)."
1,extremely poor wireless signal,"Currently my MS wireless mouse is sitting less than 1 foot away from the wireless receiver with a direct line of sight, and I'm getting ""Low"" wireless signal quality (2 bars in the IntelliPoint utility). I've tried changing the wireless channel to no avail. I live in an apartment in the city so there are other 802.11b/g signals emanating from other residents as well as my own, so this may be contributing to the low signal quality. If I move further than several yards away the signal intermittently drops out, which makes it unusable for a home media computer setup.As far as the feel of the keyboard and mouse, I have no qualms.Update 2008-05-28: Now certain keyboard keys stopped working. That's too bad, I stopped using the wireless mouse a while ago but I had thought the keyboard was adequate. I reduced my review to 1 star from 2."
2,Nice ergonomically; very poor signal quality,"I've used keyboard & mouse for 1 week, & really like the feel/ergonomics & basic functionality of both. However, the wireless signal is so inconsistent & problematic (essentially ""freezes"" computer for 30 sec. to 2 minutes) that it renders keybd & mouse unusable. I have no other wireless devices that could interfere, & MS tech suppt. is unsure what problem could be (I live in a house w/ fairly large lot, so neighboring wireless signal interference is not likely). It will work w/ little or no problem one day, then the next day I'm unable to go more than a couple of minutes without significant problems. So, not usable for me. I'm returning for a wired keybd & mouse so that I can be productive (that's the idea, right? (-: )"
3,Almost perfect,"The keyboard is perfect, mainly considering the layout of the keys Insert, Delete, Home, End, Pg Up and Pg Down. This is one of the few keyboards which Microsoft did not do the stupidity of changing the layout of such keys, keeping the classic design of a keyboard. Moreover, it is slim, comfortable, beautiful and economic in terms of battery. On the other hand, the mouse is quite heavy and uncomfortable. What I am doing is to use it with my notebook mouse, an Optical 1000, which can be synchronized with the same RF base. The base itself could be just a dongle, instead of something unreasonably large and wired, which more looks like a space ship. If you do not care about this no sense base and a heavy mouse, the keyboard is perfect."
5,Bought to replace the same keyboard,"I use this keyboard for World of warcraft and after playing for 1000's of hours, there is no paint on keys and the mouse is dead. I like the ergonomics of this and will be sad if this keyboard doesnt last as it is no longer being made :("
1,Very poor signal.,Wish I would have read the reviews before buying this. The keyboard's range seems to be no more than 3 feet. I needed it work across the room.
4,Great product for the price,"The unit does not seem to have the range problems reported by others on similar Microsoft wireless keyboard devices. While not pushed to the maximum, the range easily exceeds 3 feet. The main problem appears to be that the mouse will become sluggish to commands at times. Some experimentation is indicating that the surface the mouse is operating on is the key. When the surface is uniform in color, the unit seems to become preoccupied with finding itself (optically) and becomes less responsive to button pushes during this period. An optically diverse surface seems to correct this problem completely."
3,Acceptable Keyboard and Mouse Combo,"I bought one of these combos to my personal PC, it does almost well in everyday tasks. But gamers beware of it, it will lag and lose the signal in the worst moment, even with the receptor very near of the combo.It bugs me a lot when I'm playing some game and it stops working, i.e. running with your caracther and it stops working every time."
1,Sub-standard Product Tarnishing to Microsoft's Brand,"I've used many Microsoft-brand keyboards and mice over the years, and this one is easily the worst. I'm the IT director of my company, and we just deployed about two dozen of these on new computers. The majority of the units have been problematic, with the most common issue being extremely poor mouse reception even with new batteries and short ranges involved. The receiver and mouse just don't seem to go together and function more like infrared than RF devices (i.e., direct line of sight). One user was so frustrated that he went back to his previous old and crusty mouse. Other problems experienced less frequently have been keyboard reception problems and certain keyboard keys not working. The keyboard layout itself is also a bit non-standard and takes some getting used to. The key travel is kind of short, sort of like a laptop keyboard. Major thumbs down on this product."
2,"Poor mouse reception, broken Enter key",I had reception problems from the start with the mouse and the Enter key on the keyboard broke in less than a year. (I've used many keyboards with different computers at work and home and never had a key break like this.) too bad because it looked good in the box.
4,ER always good.........,"I have to say all the seasons of ER are great. I have always loved the show and probably never missed more than a handful when they were originally telecast and even if I did see them all its great fun to see all the old characters. I especially love Dr. Romano, or love to hate him that is. I am watching the season where Dr. Green gets sick and I have to admit seeing it again is still sad.If you love drama and intensity than ER is always a safe buy."
1,Rip off,"Don't order this. We did and got only #1 & #2, no #3. It's a rip off plain and simple. The movies are great, but I ate not getting something that we paid for.Since seeing him in The Expendables, we've gotten to like the Star alot. The Blitz is also pretty good too."
3,CD Title Misleading,"Much of the music on this CD doesn't exactly bring to mind Persia or even the Middle East. If you take it for what it is (new-ageish), the music is not bad. Just don't expect to be taken on a magic carpet ride. In my opinion, the best and most evocative pieces are those of Donald Quan."
5,2 YEAR OLD,"I purchased this new piano for my 2 year old grandchild. Prior to giving it to her, I had more fun with it than anything! I have been playing for years and this took me back to my basics! Playing by the colors was easy and fun for my Granddaughter! You will not be disappointed!!!"
5,Great even for an interested one-year-old!,"As many of the reviews suggest, younger kids love this too.Our dear friends' one-year-old has taken to this like a fish to water, and bangs on the keys two-handed, with gusto (and likely to her parents' consternation)!Well packaged and arrived in a day (Prime)!Recommended!"
2,Not so great,"I read so many great reviews of this product that I bought it for my daughter for her birthday. I am greatly disappointed. I knew this had metal rods rather than strings, but I did not expect it to sound so ""tin"" sounding. The keys are so clunky they are hard to play. This little piano looks nice and my daughter likes pulling a pillow up to it so she can sit on the pillow, but she doesn't play with this as much as her xylophone that has keys - that toy sounds better than this. I was going to get this tuned (I've read it can be), but now I'm not going to bother. I really don't think this was worth the money I spent."
2,Wouldn't have bought it if I'd tried it in a store,"First this piano is TINY, there is no way even my 1 year old could sit up to it. I have a 1 and 3 year old and each of them love banging on the keys. the ""chime"" like notes sound almost flat and are less pleasant to listen to than those little 4 key baby toys. On ours, we can not press a key twice quickly, or it sticks and won't chime the second time. Several times a key has gotten stuck where I had to fix it.Had I seen this toy in a store, there is no way I would have paid that price for it concidering it's size and sound, but it's not a terrible enough toy for me to return either. My kids LOVE banging on the keys, and when you play a song that comes in it's little book, it does sounds reasonably like the right keys, so it's not all bad... wouldn't recommend it to anyone though."
5,Great piano for kid,"This is a well constructed toy, the Quality are really great, it look like a real 1:1 size piano.Termination, color , key, material are really beautiful."
4,Great toy,I recommend placing a small piece of duct tape over the speaker to tone down the loud music.My 3 month son loves this gym. He moves his legs and arms around and squeals with laughter when the music starts.
3,the whole family enjoys this toy,"We had bought this toy for my 3month old daughter and at first she could care less for it but now (almost 4 months) she can reach for the toys and knows that if she hits them the music will play in motion mode. My 6 yr. old son like to sing along with the music . He thinks that he is teaching the baby the words to itsy bitsy spider, yanky doodle, this old man, mary had a little lamb, and hush little baby. I like it because it can be used in diffent stages of her life. the only con that i found is that while the baby is laying down on her back kicking away the toy moves with every kick. easy to fix by placing something behind it or laying down to play with her."
2,Not that great,"We bought this kick gym when my son started kicking. He didn't find it interesting at all. When he kicks at it, the gym just keeps moving back and you have to sit there and push it back and hold it or put something behind it. The green foot pad needs a good, hard kick for the sensor to start the music and the music is just too loud. I had to muffle the sound by putting a piece of tape over the speaker.I suppose it will be better for when he's older and he can get more use out of the other stages. My son is now six months and still doesn't really care for it, so for now it's just being used to block my dog from leaving the kitchen."
3,It's ok,"My daughter (6 mos) is only beginning to be able to play with this toy. I liked the idea that you could convert it so that it can grow with her. However, initially when we bought it a few months ago she was too small to reach the toys lying on her back. I think that made it very frustrating for her. I converted it to the outward facing position and hold her while she sits/stands in front of it. She does play with this but she prefers her Leap Frog table far more. Hopefully as she gets older she will get more use out it."
3,Hard to assemble - but my son loves it!,"My son played with this at a friend's house - and loved it! I bought one - and had a difficult time assembling it. I returned it for a replacement, thinking it might have been an isolated defect. But I had the same problem with the replacement one. With the help of several family members taking turns with an electric screw driver, we were finally able to assemble the pieces securely. My son loves the table! He's two yrs. and it's one of the best ""table-seats"" I've seen for him - but it sure was tough putting it together."
3,Might be nice for older babies,"I bought this for our 4 month old and, even though the picture showed an infant on his back, it does not work for mine. He loves to kick his legs and every time he does the gym would fly backwards, plus he was not able to reach the buttons and the motion feature does not always work. One great thing is it has an on/off switch but the volume is very loud. I look forward to trying this again when he is can sit up without support. Maybe it will work better then."
1,Not worth the money or your time,"We asked for this via the baby registry and received it. My son had a Kick-start gym (no longer being made) and LOVED it from 2 months until 6 months, and we'd hoped this would be at least similar but last longer. But it's not... at least, it's not at all functional for an infant. My 3-month old daughter cannot reach the toys, the ""motion"" option doesn't work when she kicks the foot plate, and she doesn't enjoy laying beneath it while we push the buttons. She does like hitting things that make songs and lights - other toys - but not this toy.Maybe it will work for you, but it's not working for us. Boring toy so far."
3,GOOG ITEM / SOME CONCERN'S,"THIS WORK'S GREAT KID LOVE'S IT BUT AFTER A WEEK, I SEEM TO HAVE A SAFETY CONCERN, WHEN THE CHILD SIT'S IT'S EASY FOR THEM TO FALL OFF (NO BACK SUPPORT)SO I WOULD CONSIDER ANOTHER PRODUCT,THAT OFFER SOME TYPE OF SUPPORT FOR THE KID'S."
2,Not infant friendly...,"When I bought this toy, I was excited and couldn't wait for my baby girl to try it out...she is only 3 months old. When we assembled it, it was disappointing to find out that the 'kick' plate doesn't do anything! Generally,infants, they LOVE to kick!...but with this toy, when they kick, it does nothing but pushes them away from the toy! it doesn't activate the SUPER LOUD music or anything..at this age, they can't reach the shapes and whatnots to activate the sounds! it is great that it is a five in one..but just not well designed for baby babies...maybe 12 months and up only."
2,Would not recommend,"Music is to loud, startling to my 4 month old daughter at times. She too can lift it up with her feet, which is not a good thing. Try taking it apart and cannot without breaking it. Think that she might get to use it when she's older as an easel?"
4,"Great toy, but LOUD!","My daughter is 8 monts old and loves this toy! She wasn't too interested in laying underneath it when she was younger, but now that she can stand she plays with it all the time. The only problem I have with this toy is that is has one volume-LOUD! I ended up putting a piece of duct tape over the speaker and it helped a lot."
4,FUN but could be DANGEROUS for a baby laying under it,"My daughter loves the toy, but I have to sit and supervise her when she is playing under it. She figured out how to put her legs under it and push it away. Sometimes she kicks it upand swings it to the side so hard that I can totally see it landing on her head and injuring her. So I just sit there and block the feet from going to the side, so when she kicks at least it lands in the same place. I also have to watch her head so she does not put under a toy's foot. Anyway, I do all this because she so entertained by this toy, that it's worth it. It's a little too loud, but it does not seem to bother our daughter. I also have her sit on the floor blocked in with the boppy and play with the toy. She loves doing that too. She also loves to stand (with support of course) and play with this toy. They need to come up with something that mounts this toy to the floor and the wall."
2,Pump down the volume,"This product has some features that attract the attention of my fourth child who is nearly five months old. Flashing lights, spinning balls, and a popping cylinder do keep children interested. However, the volume seems to have two options: loud and dang that's really loud! Granted, the product is meant to promote stimulation for the young mind, and studies suggest that infants respond best to sound. But the volume on this product is far too loud for an adult who is standing five feet above it. Imagine lying beneath a small cacophonic carnival and not knowing how to plug one's ears! The manufacturer needs to modify the volume control or provide ear plugs."
5,Great buy for baby & toddler,"I am extremely happy with this toy. I purchased the gym for my one month old who for the past four months has used it quite often along with my 3 year old. They are both now big enough to sit at the piano/desk together and love it!! I agree that it is a little loud and my youngest was able to kick the gym away from him easily when hitting the kick plate, but despite those negative aspects, it is an absolutely terrific toy!!"
1,Terrible at 'stage 1'!,"I think I am going to return this toy. Though my toddler likes it (despite being so big that when he sits in the seated position and tries to use the drawing board, it hits his knees), my baby can't use it!. She likes to kick when she gets excited - as most babies do - and she kicks the board and knocks the toy so far away from herself that she can't reach it! What a terrible design! All they needed to do was make it a little longer, or curve it less away from them. Very poor design."
2,Motion setting needs work.,"While I love the fact that this toy will grow with my son I am very dissapointed to find that the motion setting is poor to say the least. My son is almost 6 weeks old and will kick the kick plate like crazy but nothing happens. Unless your child is Hercules, the motion sensor is simply not sensitive enough. Being that the kick plate is used as a seat later on it is not hard wired to anything. You have to hit it really hard in order to make the toy function. Once in a while he gets a hold of one of the drop toys with his foot and is able to kick it hard enough to activate the toy but again, he needs to kick it extremely hard for that to happen. Sometimes I can't even get it to work. I can not let him play while I do the dishes or he gets bored. He isn't advanced nor tall enough yet to push the buttons himself so I will put it away until he can use it later. For now I'll look for another kick toy that has a real kick plate. Great concept, poor execution."
3,Adjustable Gym,"Unless we are totally wrong on how to put this together, it is very difficult to adjust each setting and we have become very frustrated with it. In order to adjust the settings, you have to unscrew several screws and some of them are very difficult to reach. I do not think this was designed as a very friendly toy for moms to adjust. Otherwise my grandson seems to like it OK. He does not spend as much time with this as some of his other toys. Perhaps because we can't seem to get the angle right."
1,NOT GREAT,"The idea of this toy is cute & a great concept...We bought this for my daughter when she was 3 months old - she was kicking like crazy at the time so we thought this was the perfect toy - WRONG!!1st of all, she was in the 100% for her height and that said, the toy was way too tall off the ground for her to reach and play with it...2nd - when she kicked it, nothing happened...we later found, it doesn't have an activated kick pad!3rd - 3 of the 4 boxes that I purchased, items were missing (screws, batteries, etc.) - come to find out it was because multiple were returns!!I was lucky the store i bought it from took it back assembled (b/c I no longer had the box) - this wasn't worth a penny!! (even though it says it can grow with them - my daughter has always been big for her age - she's still in the 95% for her weight - so she would have outgrown the weight limit to sit on it before she was even able to use that function)..."
5,An eye opener,"For anyone interested in the cognitive topics, machine learning and artificial intelligence, this book is an eye opener. The point of view it presents attempts to put an order in what ""meaning"" really means.Drawbacks of the book? The lack of conceptualization when it comes to dynamic concepts (treated very superficially). Also, the theory is deficient when modeling the functional aspects of concepts (a ""sin"" already recognized by the author).But considering the pioneering character of this piece of art, these drawbacks are just compelling invitations for further research in the field."
4,Wood crib,Item as described and does what I want. Simple assembly. Would be better with a bar running down each end to keep logs from falling through.
1,unpleasent read,"The daily entries were very repetitive. Also, she wrote about how other fat people disgusted her. Well, her assumptions about other fat people disgusted me. Every overweight person does not hide in their bedroom eating a dozen candy bars as she implied. She tried to speak for all fat people as though we all shared her habits. Also, I think it's sad how she continually blamed her family for not ""helping"" her to lose weight. She seems like a very depressed human being. I hope she finds peace with herself."
1,DEPRESSING!,"I read through ths book when it first came out. I can't agree with the author's method of losing weight and unfortunately, she applies this method within her relationship with her young daughter. Calling names is what we have to deal with when connected with strangers. How Ms. Green thinks we should put ourselves down is beyond me. Please, take the time to find another book for motivation. (Slow but Sure is a good one!)"
1,This book makes a great doorstop.,"I just knew this book would make me laugh and make me cry. Well, it did. I laughed in glee, happy that I hadn't shelled out money for this book and I cried when I realized how many hours I wasted reading this garbage. I have absolutely no idea how I managed to read the entire book. I kept hoping it would get interesting at SOME point. It didn't. If you want to read basically the same diary entry reworded about 1,000 times and listen to someone drone on and on about how depressing her life is, then this book is for you! Talk about a broken record!!! I've dealt with debilitating depression and weight problems for years myself and even I wanted to say ""Rosemary, honey, get over it and get a life."" Not to mention the author contradicts herself more than once about many issues. Puh-leeease! Pure drivel and totally uninspiring. If I could give it zero stars, I would."
5,fine item,"the book is obviously not new, but nothing wrong with it, just looks like a book that i would have on my personal book shelf, and i take good care of my pocessions. would use seller again."
1,"DON""T BUY THIS BOOK!!!","There is no clearer way to say it, ""Don't buy this book!"" Not only is it a horrible example of ""success"", but in my opinion it could be dangerous for other overweight people who may be struggling or depressed themselves. This book is filled with hatred toward overweight people, and fat itself. I read a review of the book much like many of the other one star reviews, but I thought, ""if nothing else it will be an interesting read, even if it's not a motivational weight loss story."" What a mistake! Thankfully, I only spent about $5 on the book. Take my advise. Don't waste your money or your time."
2,A sad a short-sighted work,"This book broke my heart. Ms. Green's focus on her weight as her one and only problem, and weight loss as her goal in life will doom her to failure at permanent weight loss and as a human being. A reviewer asked ""where's the sequel?"" I would bet there is none because Ms. Green is fat and struggling again, never having made peace with herself about where society's demands and imperatives end and she begins. Her self hatred will be her downfall. Awful, a painful read. I wish Ms. Green well, wherever she is in her struggle today."
1,no motivation from this garbage,"This woman's main problem isn't weight. She needs some serious therapy. I would rather weigh 300 pounds than have her attitude. Her self-loathing, and horrible remarks about how fat people eat, and tubs of lard are disgusting. She claims to be so religious, but I want no part of the kind of religion where it is okay to call yourself a ""tub of lard"" and malign others if they decide to practice fat acceptance. It might not be okay for her, but how dare she claim it isn't okay for others. How dare she put all fat people in the category of sinful tubs of lard who have disgusting rolls of fat. It was one of the saddest books I've ever read. I only have about 15 pounds to lose, but nothing about this woman inspires me. I just feel intense anger at her judgmental attitude."
3,"A long, hard look at myself","Terribly interesting, mainly because the author suffers from what everyone experiences when losing weight. The inconsistencies, the uneven ups and downs and even her relationship with her husband. I'm dissappointed that there is no follow-up, but that is just another inconsistency in her life. Spoiler alert- she is only about 10 pounds thinner at the end (15 years later). Sadly, I'll read it again, and again."
5,Diary of a fat housewife..must read,Well to begin with Rosemary has kept her weight off. I spoke to her only last week and she has kept off 186 pounds. This woman truly knows the plight of the fat person. She is not down on them but tries to motivate them to lose. As I write this I have lost 28 pounds and am still counting. She also hosts a talk radio show on weight loss and has a program called Winning at thinning that is also worth the money. If this book were still at the original price I would go out and buy it. It is great. She is unlike the diet gurus of today who may have lost 10-20 pounds she has lost 186 and kept it off. Maybe those who have not given it good ratings should reread it and see from it the pain she went thru. She never puts fat people down cause she still remembers the pain of the obese.Very highly recomended book.Linda
5,Nice truck,I got this log truck for my son for Christmas. He absolutely loves it. The only thing is the hitch broke off for the trailer but he still plays with it all the time. Great shipping and product.
2,big disappointment,"I only give this item a generous 2 stars because the delivery and packaging of this item was quick, efficient and attractive. Yes, it looks nice even in person when it's all pacakged up but this truck was so poorly made. I bought this truck and another one by the same company for my 2 sons for Christmas (ages 3 & 6) and it's now January 4th, and both of the trucks are basically trashed and have been as of December 27th. My boys were not rough with these trucks and pieces have been snapping off left and right. The cabs of the trucks are metal but absolutely everything else on them is cheap and very breakable plastic. If you are buying this ONLY to look at it from afar - then it would be fine but any sort of movement will be sure to break something!"
2,Broke Immediately,"This was not designed to be played with. Not by children anyway. It broke immediately (the exhaust pipes on the truck and the little thingies holding the logs in broke off the trailer which means it won't hold the logs in anymore). Huge disappointment. TheBruder Toys Man Timber Truck with Loading Crane and 3 Trunksis better. Perhaps they should use different plastic. This is thin, brittle plastic not the typical, durable TOY MATERIAL plastic."
3,Pretty Good,"This is an ok product. It is die cast, but anything that is plastic is very whimpy plastic. My 3 year old son had it broke the first night. It is now wired together."
5,Nice truck,So far (we have not unpackaged the truck) we are pleased with the price and size of the truck and trailer. We can only hope the arm works well for unloading the logs - our grandson will find out Christmas Day...
2,Broke the first day,My 5 year old son was so disappointed! He cherishes his trucks and is obsessed with taking good care of them but the plastic connector broke immediately! We had to tape it together and then just took off that part altogether. I really wish I could get my money back on this one. It is nice to look at but deceivingly bad quality.
3,More of a collectible than a toy,"I gave this toy 3 stars simply because it is not sturdy enough for young children to play with and I don't think the price matches the quality of the item. The truck description describes it as a die-cast toy, but the only metal part on the whole truck is the cab. The trailer and crane are cheap plastic which I could see breaking VERY easily. My 8yr old son insisted on buying this w/his bday money and is very gentle w/his stuff. I explained to him my concerns with the plastic parts so he keeps it on a shelf and gets it down to play with and puts it back when he's done. I would not recommend buying this for a young boy, he would just be heartbroken when it breaks! But if you have a careful kid that maybe wants a collectible type toy then I would say yes, because it does look pretty on the shelf!"
1,don't buy this overpriced cheap truck,"I bought this online hoping for better quality than the cheap plastic trucks at Toys R Us. I assumed (wrongfully) that since is was expensive and 'metal' it would be good. It turns out the cab and crane arm are metal, but everthing else is plastic and very cheap. If you want to pay a lot for a truck to sit on a shelf it will work. If your child actually wants to play with the truck don't buy it. Very cheap, broke almost immediately, thrown out soon thereafter."
3,Kenworth Log Hauler- Toy truck,"I was a little disappointed with the Kenworth log truck. It looks good and there are a lot of nice features, but it is not very sturdy. The hitch for the trailer is very short and as a result the trailer doesn't stay connected when my son goes to pull it. We had to attach some weight to the bar where the trailer connects to the hitch. Also, the seat that is attached at the top of the truck, by the crane, fell off as we were removing it from the box."
1,A waste of paper....,"This book is a waste of the paper it was written on. Don't get me wrong, it has some good advice about writing a resume, but you can get that ANYWHERE. I was looking for some insight into writing a resume for a ""Scientific and Technical Career"" as the title would suggest. I just finished reading it, and besides the title, you wouldn't be able to tell it apart from any other book written about resumes. The only place it made an attempt was to include some ""Scientific / Technical"" resumes in the Sample Resumes section."
3,a little funky but it does work,"Yes, the litle bits of lemon can be a bit funky but if you are sitting at the beach, the pool or sitting on a boat-like I am when I use it- who cares? It is not meant for instant gratification-if you want salon highlights-shell out the $100 plus and just go that route. But as a gradual and natural hair lightener you can't beat it. I use it every summer (I do have short hair so it lightens quickly)Wish I could still find it-Guess I will be mixing up my own conconction this year :("
2,A Very Simple Local Gov't Text,"If you are looking for a book to learn some basic information about current issues in state and local government, you might enjoy this book. It reads like it is designed to bore high school and college students. With the picture of Ray Nagin on the cover, I thought that its contents may be at least controversial and thought provoking. Unfortunately, it is just too simplistic to be pleasurable reading."
4,High quality but very dated,"I am a longtime subscriber to BH&G; Wood magazine, so its no surprise that I appreciate the high quality plans contained in this book. The 14 projects are broken into three sections: Storage Units; Tables, Chairs, and Desks; and Outdoor Furniture.Everything you need to know to build these projects is clearly explained and well illustrated. The only drawback for me as a woodworker is that most of these projects have a distictly dated feel to them, with most of the pieces looking like contemporary furniture from the late 1970s and early 1980s. The exception would be that the outdoor furniture projects are of more classic designs and thus will not go out of style.Overall this is a high quality book that suffers only this one flaw."
2,It was a cassette from 1975 and did not work. I e mailed vendor with no reply.,"This is a beautiful recording of the Music of Victor Herbert by Beverly Sils, but...I heard it on someone elses CD. This was an old cassette and it did not work. I asked the sellr for a return or exchange and never heard back."
2,it's a good book for younger readers,It wasn't clear to us this was primarily written for children...hence we were disappointed as we were looking for something of far greater depth and maturity..
4,Same stuff reissued only less,"I just wanted to point out that Bloomfield: Red Hot and Blue contains EVERY song on this title PLUS 4 others. I don't know about the remastering or quality, but it seems this cd is not worth the buy with the other available. (4 stars though cause I love Bloomfield and I know the stuff on here is good)"
2,Not same as pictured,Picture is not the same as the product they send to you. It come without the lancets divice.
2,A beginner video,"I was looking forward to this video.I thought it would have some really good ideas on decorating & even some different recipes.I already have the recipes shown {anyone who has a betty crocker or pillsbury cookie book will also] and the decorating is something your 5 year old can do.The instructions were good for what they did,you werent rushed over the ingredient's and they went step by step.The two women were pleasant and paid attention to what they were doing.For this i gave it two stars.As there wasnt any other reviews to go on when i bought this video i hope mine can help some future buyer."
2,For beginner's,"This is a very basic cooking tape.I was looking forward to new ideas and recipes that i thought would be in this.There wasnt,if you are just learning and do not have many cookbooks then this is the tape for you.The decorating any five year old could do.I would recommende this tape if you have a child that is just starting to learn to cook a few things."
1,broken tool,my snap ring pliers broke after the second use....they re designed them from the last pair i own for about 7 yrs..i wrote the company i bought them from and they never responded to my email....
4,awesome!,I bought this item as a gift for my friend's mom. It arrived earlier than expected and the lady just loved it. This item is a good-buy(awesome price for this wonderful earrings) as a gift or personal use.
5,Log Stacker Brackets,"They do the job. Good value. You might have to trim down the 2 by 4's if you use pressure treated wood as they tend to run larger that 3-1/2"" by 1-1/2""."
