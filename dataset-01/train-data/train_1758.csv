5,This book is killer!!!,Tells about all character's young years and increases the detail on the story as a whole.
5,Definetly one of the best,This is one of the best dragonlance books I have ever read... I like it alot. All you raistlin fans out there this is a must read.
5,Finally. A book on the best character in the DL saga,"Raistlin is one of the most intriging and interesting characters I have ever read about. After reading many DL books, and focusing my attention mainly on him, I was very happy that there was finally a book about his early years. The story is very revealing and informative. I was hoping for a little more action however. Like, Raistling kicking some ( ). While there isn't much of that, it's still a must for anybody who enjoys the character as much as I do."
5,A Must Have for Dragonlance Fans,"This book tells the early years of our dark hero Raistlin Majere. This book is briliantly written and should defenitly be a must have. The early life of Raistlin is told here in full detail, showing already the hatred and pity people show him. It will make you really feel for our character. Don't miss this book!"
4,"Good book, but not entirely about one character","While the book was well written and an excellent addition to the Dragonlance series, I think it should have been titled differently. The book may focus on Raistlin quite a bit, but it also provides a good deal of background into many of the original characters. Another 50 pages could have been added to make it fit nicely with the Chronicles. The section describing his experience with the Test was a bit disappointing, too. It was a good book, however. It's just the title that was a bit misleading. A must have for any fan."
5,A great book for first time dragonlance readers,"If you like fantasy and are looking for a new series, I suggest dragonlance and the first book you should read is this one. It provides a great back gound for the entire saga starting from the get go. Follow up with the chronicles trilogy and yo are well on your way to a great reading experience. This book tells the story of two youn youths and their struggle to survive, and their struggle against each other. I recommend it for anyone, not just those who enjoy fantasty."
4,Finally the truth about Raistlin's Test!,"I only gave this book four stars because I thought it slowed down in parts. But overall this is still a great book. I'm glad the Dragonlance authors have finally started writing books about the most secretive character in the series. Raistlin Is my favorite character. If you like Raistlin, Caramon, or Kitara, then you should definitly read Brothers in Arms. It is the second book in the Raistlin Chronicles. Brothers in amrs was so good, I give it five stars. Both books are great. I recomnd that you read them as soon as possible!"
4,Makes me wonder...,This book was a great way to reconnect with the Dragonlance books that I first enjoyed some ten years ago. I only wonder how the book would have differed if Tracy Hickman had a hand in its creation. The only downfall of the book is that it tends to elevate Raistlin to a higher level of importance in the overall Dragonlance story arc than that of the other characters.
2,skip it,"I bought this book because it had such high reviews. Needless to say, I was disappointed. I think that M.W. has a good writing style, but the story lacks any pizazz. The characters are boing and predictable. Why did so many people like this book?"
3,Entertaining but also disappointing,"I did enjoy reading it, but hardly a five star book. I had read a later story by the same author so it was interesting to meet the characters in their debut novel. Here we have our dungeons and dragons collection - warrior, mage, thief, elf, dwarf etc. It was like the author felt, well I need one of these and one of those because it is a fantasy. Characters are stereotypical and shallow. I also read the second volume, but not bothering with the third."
5,Shaved door kit with remote,This product was easy to install and worked great. I would recommend it to any body wanting a shaved door kit.
2,More a football memoir than anything else,"My niece gave me this book to help me work through my mid-life crisis. Maybe teaching would be my next career!. So I read through this mostly football book and found that the teacher makes only cameo appearances while Edmondson gives you lots of details about his height, weight and playing style.The teacher, who left the profession after only one year, is never well defined. He gives up trying to teach his students the classics of philosophy but has more luck with Kesey and Malcolm X. Oddly the pivotal momemt seems to be a snow-ball fight.If this book had been advertised as a high school memoir about inner growth and the importance of football, I would give it 4 stars. However, as it is I think the author and publisher are guilty of false advertising."
3,flashes of brilliant writing,"This memoir is a mixed bag. Some of the chapters are riveting, such as Chapter 4 where Edmundson paints a vivid and moving portrait of his father, while other chapters ramble disjointedly about getting drunk, football, and classmates who were obviously special to the author at the time but whose charm was not brought fully alive for this reader. It's worth reading but be forewarned, you have to slog through a morass of material more appropriate to a 40th high school reunion reminiscence than a published work of non-fiction to get to the good stuff."
2,Students and Teachers,"Before reading this book, I assumed it was about an excellent teacher in whom the children connected with. After completing the book, I realized it told of the struggles of a high school senior and his reform with the help of his teacher, Mr. Lears. Told from the first point of view, Mark Edmundson shows how no child has to fail. I do not reccomend this book to college level students, though I do reccomend it to the younger audience. Teachers having difficulty in their own classes may find this book inspirational and helpful."
4,More about Lears,"For everyone who read the book and wondered, as I did, what ever happened to Frank Lears, NPR did an interview with Edmundson, which is available to listen to on the web. It's about 4 minutes long. The interview was on Aug. 31, 2003, on ""Weekend Edition"" and the title was ""Teacher Follow-Up."" Amazon won't let me post the link, but to find it, do a Google search of: ""Edmundson teacher npr interview Liane Hansen"". After reading the book, it was fun to listen to the interview. Added March, 2007: The above comments were written a couple of years ago. Now it looks like the interview is no longer on the web. Sorry!"
2,Teacher: The One Who Made The Difference,"For my English class I read ""Teacher : The One Who Made the Difference"" by Mark Edmundson. I felt that this book was kind of misleading. It was supposed to be about a teacher that made an effect on his student, Mark Edmundson. The author didn't talk much about Frank Lears, the teacher, and only really focused on Edmundson's high school experience. He played football and hung out with his buddies like any other student. Mark Edmundson should've given the book a different title because I read this book hoping to learn about how teachers can make a difference on their students. Lears let his students think for themselves and that's basically what the book points out in the end. If you want to read about football and about someones high school life, then maybe this book will interest you. If you're looking for a book that talks about a teacher and their students, then definitely don't pick this book."
4,Thought-provoking,"Despite its occasional tedious passages, I have not stopped thinking about Teacher since I finished it a week ago. As a high school teacher and an avid reader, I picked this book up hoping it would be an inspiring story of a teacher's ability to make a difference. It is certainly that, but it is also much more. As I read I found myself contemplating Lears as a teacher and evaluating my own teaching goals and methods. While I'm not entirely convinced Lears had all the answers, this book has certainly provoked a great deal of reflection about the teacher I am and the teacher I'd like to be. Anyone who is dedicated to teaching students how to think for themselves should read this book."
2,Disappointment,"(...) book on NPR and that interview was excellent. (That's why I bought the book.) Edmundson focussed on what a difference Lears made in his life, and Lears spoke for a few moments, which was touching. The book's focus, however, is on football, sex, the Vietnam war and drinking for about 190 pages. Edmundson spends too much time setting the scene rather than showing the outcome of Lears' influence on his students' hearts and minds. Finally, if you endure, the last 70 pages are about how a teacher can change young lives."
2,Not Enough Life,"I think that this book was fairly interesting. It didn't have enough rivetting thoughts to keep the reader interested. Even though I was unhappy about the book, it's still a good read. I think that this book would be appropriate for a much younger audience, an age group of ten to sixteen."
2,Jay's Wicked Awsome Review ! ! ! : ),"This book was an enjoyable story, but it had many points that did not hold my attention. I also could not find much interest in the book due to the fact that it was a tedious story. Many points got boring and I would have trouble concentrating. This is just an average book. I would only reccomend it to a middle-school reader."
1,"Boring, Rambling, Poorly-Written Memoir","I am a teacher and a writer, and I had so looked forward to this book. What a disappointment! This book is NOT really about the TEACHER who made the diffference to this writer (as I had expected). It is a coming-of-age story about this author. This story might mean something to anyone who experienced a similar coming of age (thug-turned-professor), but I'm afraid it meant very little to me. It was all I could do to FORCE myself to keep reading it, and by the end, I felt that I had completely wasted my time and my money. In my opinion, don't waste your money on this book."
1,High school nerd tale,"Reading this book, I started off thinking that the author had quite a high school career--amazing professors, amazing classmates, and, of course, the high school girls. I wondered about the last thing, however, when I began to notice that the girls never spoke and their interest in Edmundson was told via the author. The jacket cover suggests the author is Woody Allenish-type, so nothing there to claim attraction. His brilliance? Hard to tell. It appears to be at his own word. Then there's the author's mean streak: he attacks first and asks questions later. An author who manufactures the interest of adoring women? Definitely."
2,Meffa,"I read the book expecting a nostalgic trip back to Medford High. What I got was total fiction as none of the characters resemble anyone that I remember. My sister was in all the honors courses that year, including history. The teacher described in the book is total fiction."
1,Teacher The One Who Made The Difference,"The book that I just finished reading ""Teacher The One Who Made The Difference"" by Mark Edmundson was an average book. At first when I bought the book I thought that it would be interesting and enjoyable to read but it was not really interesting at all.There were so many ideas that were hard to follow, and it did not talk particulary about the teacher and how he changed his life.I would not recommned it to anyone, but if you like to read for pleasure and you have time you certainly can. There were some chapters that keep you interested but there were some that you just do not want to read. Overall it had a nice ending."
5,How Reading Can Change Your Life,"Mark Edmundson's chronicleof a year in the life of Medford High is, first and foremost, acompulsively good read, by turns moving and hilarious, unsentimental yet ultimately uplifting. Teacher is bracing from first page to last. Yet Edmundson manages not only to delight but also--deftly, brilliantly--to instruct. Teacher taught me more about education--its purposes, its practices, its rewards--that anything I've ever read on the subject. Whatmakes a great teacher? What are books for? How can reading change your life? By the end of this wonderful book, you know."
4,Enlightening and delightful,"This book is not common book, it is some kind of catalog for you to choose among the best material human kind has ever created or shaped the western culture. Reviews and explanations are short, clear and make the reading of all these works a tempting pleasure. I strongly recommend it to you all specially if you are somewhat afraid with all the ""classics""."
4,Nice shoes,"The shoes are nice and comfy for the most part. Black with red accent looks very cool. I like how I can tie them down from toe to ankle unlike some other shoes. Grip is good, but no squeeky noises. Maybe I'm too lightweight. My other shoes were Jordans xii and the crazy 8 are much more comfy and easier to run with and change directions."
3,just so so,"Compared with the former ""feet you wear"" Kobe shoes, i would say this pair is a bit disappointing to me. Its sole is too hard and it lacks solic ankle support. What's more is that the pair i bought looks a bit fake( not very well made)."
4,;0),"I liked it I thought it had good action and the plot isn't bad. I enjoyed it and like seeing Jolie in action movies, I did thought though that in this movie Salt most of the stunts are like Jolie's movie ""Wanted"".Towards the end love the twist was surely not expecting that."
4,Good movie,Well i bought it so i must like it or i would have returned it. Got it on a good deal so couldnt pass up buying it.
4,A good thriller and action picture.,"In spite that it raises many questions, the film keeps you waiting for the unexpected, and you don't guess what."
4,Salt (Blu-ray),"There was a lot of action in the movie but what I like the most is that you never knew, until the end, who was who and who was working for who."
3,action,"we liked this movie, good plot and well acted, makes you wonder if things like this can really happen here."
4,Worth Viewing,"I have read a lot of negative reviews which, I think, speak more of male insecurity than the movie itself. Angelina Jolie is the movie, and, if you like Jolie, you will like this movie. She brings subtle depth to what could have been a very shallow character. Her martial arts is smooth and believable - the outcome, like all actions movies requires suspension of disbelief. It doesn't matter if it is Matt Damon or Angelina Jolie dropping opponents left and right, or, Chow Yun Fat flying through the air - the viewer always has to buy in. Why is it that men can accept Ulma Thurman and Michelle Yeon performing both gravity and strength defying stunts, but have so much difficulty accepting Jolie outside her role as Lara Croft. I found that the movie held my attention through out. However, the movie does have holes, and, I think the ending in the Extended Version is far better than the Cinema Release or the Director's Cut."
3,movie,"got it in a timely order. the description said it was like new, but when i got it, it had a crack on the middle. It seems to work fine still"
3,Typical action,I enjoyed this predictable fast action movie. Parts were filmed in my hometown which sparked my interest for this movie.
3,"Love the Movie, Freezes in the Middle of Movie","I enjoyed the two extra cuts very much, especially the directors cut. Great Movie. I bought this as a replacement for one I had had for several years. That dvd would stop repeatedly in the middle of the movie. I finally replaced it with this copy and after watching this dvd the third time, it stopped once in the middle of the movie. I think perhaps a different dvd version of Salt would be preferable to this dvd. I am puzzled by both dvds freezing."
3,"Entertaining, But Not Much Else","Salt entertains but doesn't do much else. Jolie gives a good performance but beyond that, the plot is predictable and preposterous. There's some good action scenes to be had but the film doesn't have a high rewatch value."
3,too much action and not enough character development left me wanting,"If your true love is an action movie, you would not be disappointed. however, i wanted a balanced movie with suspense, character development etc. Oh well....."
1,Don't waste your money,"This movie plot is extremely predictable, even by action movie standards. I am still trying to figure out how Angelina Jolie keeps getting selected for these roles. If you have seen Tomb Raider or Mr. and Mrs. Smith or Wanted then you have already seen this movie at least once. Move on."
2,terrible playback,"playback was terrible. starting and stopping through out the movie, ALL 3 VERSIONS. if i could return it i would.p.s. sony please stop with the transparent disc SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY SONY, ITS WORTH IT"
2,Too much bad Salt,I saw it once. Don't believe the reviews about this being a smart or intelligent thriller. Smart is not a CIA agent open firing at someone in the middle of bumper to bumper traffic where innocent people could easily be hit by a ricochet. Intelligent is not obsessing if one of your own is a traitor after the same informant kills two of your people. I have no interest in seeing it again.
2,Predictable,"Action movie and you know that action will be in the next scene. By the end you do not care,"
3,Salt DVD,"I did not enjoy this movie. It started strangely and I never really got into it from there. Maybe I missed something along the way, however, there was too much killing and the hole plot never made much sense. I did not enjoy the movie at all."
2,none,Angelina Jolie speaks few words at most for the whole film most of it is action. Bad choice for a role I seen other films where she performs a lot better than this one.
2,needed some pepper to balance it out,"watched this film recently and felt it was decent, but hardly worth the hype. the action was it's selling points and machinary going down, but the film just didn't click with me like that. Angelina Jolie has a strong pressence, however this film felt a step off and never really caught my full attention. it was just aight and i've seen this formula so much."
1,"Not a very good deal! ""Dammaged Movie!""",I was so disapointed because the movie was totally unviewable! So Dammaged that I couldn't even tell what the movie was about!
4,Waiting & Hoping For Salt Part 2,"I remember when Angelina Jolie was filming Salt, and certain scenes were filmed in NYC. Many times pictures of her making the movie were shown in the local newspapers. Anyway, I finally watched the theatrical cut on dvd and the fast paced action kept me interested thoughout. Jolie did a fine job with many of the stunts and the plotline was interesting as well. As others have mentioned, it was obvious she really loved her husband Michael. The scenes of Salt constantly on the run and then escaping capture were top notch. Although when it was released this movie received so-so reviews, I am still hoping there will eventually be a follow up story. I won't give the ending of this story away, but those of you who have seen the movie know that the way it ended, it left you wanting more."
2,Not too hot,Usually Angelina Jolie is a good actress. I don't this movie is even good. I would say that thr fault falls with the Writers. Wish I could get my money back.
3,NOT A FAN OF THIS MOVIE OR of Angelina Jolie's performan,"It was ok Not a fan of Angelina Jolie, it's okay at best wouldn't pay money to see it again!"
3,Mind numbing entertainment [no spoilers!],"Like binge-eating 10 boxes of your favorite candy, digesting Salt is easy. It's a predictable, chase/thriller of the highest order. LikeSafe House, the film features the cliched, CIA-operative-gone-rogue narrative.Who's who? Who can you trust?As someone in the psychology field, the opening scenes, which feature an interview/interrogation, don't come close to realistic portrayals of lie detection. There is neural imaging without any cognitive device attached to the head. There is voice analysis for lie detection, but no measurement of galvanic skin response.When Salt runs, the entire CIA goes after her. She has shown no lethal force and they begin firing at her.Seemingly, every Russian possible infiltrates the US military to make the events unfold occur.It's farfetched - bordering on the insane. But it's also good junkfood if you've got a couple hours to spare."
3,MISLEADING,There are 3 versions of this film. They are not just slightly different. The ending is much different.Amazon gives all three the exact same review statistics (stars) this is absolutely false and misleading.
3,HIGH ON THE ACTION & AVERAGE ON STORY,High octane action galore but the story is uneven and even unsatisfying in certain parts. Flashbacks to the love story give the tale some texture but it's not enough. Jolie isn't very believable to me as an action hero when she starts going hand-to-hand with people bigger than her (maybe if she did judo instead of direct attacks) which takes away from believability for me. I would only recommend this if you like action scenes over story or you just like looking at Jolie's pretty face. DIALOGUE/CHARACTERS: C plus to B minus; STORY/PLOTTING: C plus to B minus; ACTION SCENES: B plus to A minus; OVERALL GRADE: B minus; WHEN WATCHED: February 2011.
4,Angelina Jolie is amazing.,I like this movie because of the plot. It's one of those movies where you really need to pay attention to detail. I think they did an awesome job on Jolie's character and she did an awesome job playing. If you are looking for a physiological thriller this is you're movie.
3,It matters how you look at it,"There are two ways to look at this movie;1) Taken as a serious film, it's ridiculouslystupid. I mean this movie is aimed at thelowest common denominator. It' sounbelievable that it's practially a liveaction cartoon. Other than the Joliecharacter, the other characters are idiotic,especially the Liev Schrieber one.2) Viewed as a ""guilty pleasure"", this is a funpiece of mondo trash. Angelina Jolie issuper sexy, makes as good as a heroine asany, the action sequences are thrilling andthe plot turns are akin to pro wrestling.I do not condone the use of controlled substances but this is essentially ""pot""/drunkard entertainment. It's the type of movie where , if you just catch snippets, it's good enough. This is not a movie that you need to view from start to finish.If there would have been some choice nudity, then it really would have upped the trash-o-meter a la ""Showgirls"""
3,Worth seeing,"This was an okay film, definitely worth seeing but I'm glad I rented it rather than paying big bucks to see it on screen. I think the acting is well done, and the even tho the story is a bit predictable, it was enjoyable to watch. Liev Schreiber is just so darn good, I could watch anything he was in. It was a little too violent for me in places, but I'm sure others would disagree."
3,average action flick,"This move starts out great, solid action sequences and a very interesting plot line. This falls apart quickly and turns to a much more campy anti-soviet plot-line that really lost it for me. Still has some good action sequences and ends up entertaining, but this fails to live up to the excellent ad campaign the preceded it."
3,Angelina shines,"""Salt"" is a film that was bashed by film critics, because it's an action film. Once again however, this action film is not as bad as the critics say it is.The basic plot for ""Salt"" is focused on character Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) who is a CIA agent. One day while interrogating a Russian defector, he tells her that a person by the name of Salt is going to assassinate the Russian president. In hearing this, the CIA decides to keep Salt in the interrogation room, to ask her some questions. She decides to run away which begs the question, is she a spy?Angelina Jolie is the kind of actor where if she has a good script to follow like ""Changeling"" directed by Clint Eastwood, she is very good. ""Salt"" has a good plot, in which Angelina shines."
3,Twist and turns,"It seems Angelina Jolie has found her comfort zone when it comes to making movies; special agents who live in a world of complex missions, unsure loyalties, high-tech gadgets, and gunfights. Whether it be Wanted, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Tombraider, or now this 2010 release, her live-action movies seem to blend into each other. In this one, she is an American, raised as a Russian spy, who joins the CIA, pretends to carry out her mission for Russia, while intending to save America. Sounds complicated? Well, the action scenes help to explain everything, and it does it at under 2 hours in length. For fans of Jolie's physique, you will be disappointed as she shows no skin; in fact she is often wearing various disguises. For fans of Bond movies, the Bourne trilogy, and the Mission Impossible films, this is right up your alley. Overall, an average movie whose biggest distinction is that the star is a female; unlike the previously listed male-anchored films."
4,Great action movie with Ms. Jolle returning to kick-ass mode,"Who would have ever though 12 years ago that perhaps the best action stars of their generation would be Matt Damon and Angelina Jolle? Salt essentially is a ""Bourne"" movie with a female lead. Evelyn Salt can kick ass as well as anyone and that is pretty much what she does. The film doesn't promise to be a thinking man's (or woman's) story and has no pretenses. It is, however a really well done action movie with a star that proves that her stunt work is as good as her acting and her looks. Packaged up with some standout support from Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor this is how action movies should be made. Granted, the plot is pretty ridiculous and I was able to figure out the ultimate twist early on. Still I liked it very much.This Blu ray transfer approaches some of the best quality that can be seen. Likewise for the DTS-HD Master Audio. There are several opportunities to show off a good system with a 360 degree soundfield."
3,Another excuse for Angelina to run around like an action hero,"It seems Hollywood will take any excuse to get Angelina Jolie running around with a gun and makeup. The plot of this movie is laughably bad. It revives Cold War fears of Russian sleeper agents, except Jolie's character Salt can take on squads of Americans without getting a scratch. The movie does a good job at keeping the audience guessing, to the point where I was even surprised by one or two of the plot twists. But overall it's fairly predictable and silly. I'd give it 2 stars, plus an additional star for managing to make Angelina Jolie look hot as both a blonde and brunette."
1,She'll fight for freedom......,This past Saturday I decided to take advantage of my local theaters air conditioning and perused the paper to see if there were any movies worth seeing. I chose the Angelina Jolie movie Salt. Simply put. I don't see what all the rave reviews for this movie were brought on by. Any fan of the old Mission:Impossible tv series with Peter Graves could see the twists and turns coming miles away but there is a much more annoying aspect to this movies toilet paper thin plot. The major scene that takes place several feet under the White House is a direct ripoff of the same sequence in the much better acted live action G.I. Joe movie that was out in theaters last year. So I strongly suggest you rent that movie instead and take this Jolie action adventure with a grain of salt.
2,A mess.,"""Salt' is a mess. The plot is either incomprehensible or ludicrous and illogical. Theaction sequences are ridiculous , way over the top (What next I thought at one point, is she now going to fly ?)and way too long. Maybe a twelve year old would find it all exciting. I found it a monotonous bore."
2,??,"I just finished watching Salt. I know I am behind the times. I just must comment. The commercials made the film look interesting and exciting. Sadly, I was disappointed! It reminded me of a mix of Taken and The Bourne Trilogy. I found it bland and generic. I am glad I watched the rented DVD and didn't pay the going rate at a movie theater. Hopefully someone in Hollywould (that's the way I want to spell it) can come up with a better action film starring a female lead. If there is a part 2, I hope it is way better than this!! :0("
2,this is a Pass,"Take what you have seen in all 3 Bourne Movies, add in the same plot twists they used in ""Get Smart"" (only this isn't supposed to be a comedy) and the same set pieces you played in the latest Call of Duty Black Ops, and you have Salt. Its uninspired, poorly paced, at times frustratingly outrageous, and unsatisfying. Also its one of those films that intentionally leaves the end open to make it into a trilogy. At least the Bourne franchise had the decency to wrap up the story in the first one, leaving it as an ending that was actually an ending."
2,Where are the other versions?,"I purchased this ""Deluxe Unrated Edition"" with its promise of three versions of the film. Nothing of the sort. There is ONE version. That's it. No other extended cuts. What is ""Deluxe"" about this? I like the film, but I would not have purchased the special edition without the ""promise"" of more. I feel cheated."
1,"Awful, contrived, Bourne rip-off","Ok, I don't write reviews very often but want to save people the money from renting or buying this awful film. Rented it last night on Amazon Video-On-Demand and turned it off after about 40 minutes. This film, too me, is a complete rip-off of the Bourne series, only the Bourne series are some of the best action films ever made. Not going to ruin the plot here for people who will still rent or buy this, but the actual idea is pretty cool. And of course, Angelina looks amazing and kicks *** of course. It is just the execution of the plot and writing that is horrible. Directing isn't so hot either. Boring, linear and just a tad too unrealistic (even for this genre). If you must watch this film, at least rent it or Netflix it so you don't waste too much money. If you are the few people in the world who hasn't seen the Bourne series and you are looking for action, I'd rent them instead."
4,"Total bunk, but great entertainment","The martial arts in this movie are good, but let's just say this: no one is that good. I have trained for over 10 years and have even trained with some of the guys who did the MA work on this film and trained Angelina to fight. Let's just say this: no one could ever be that good. A Russian spy takes out 4 U.S. CIA or FBI guys who have handguns ?! Puuuhlease.Other than that, this movie is really exciting and good, good fun. One of the better movies since ""The Bourne Identity"" (which, incidently ""suffered"" from the same issue).Btw, if the Soviets had been that good, we all would be speaking Russian now."
1,Blu ray Disc Review of Salt (Deluxe Unrated Edition) (2010),"This is a review for the Disc itself, not the movie. I hate when Movie Companies, in this case Sony, make you watch ads on things that you have paid for. I have an LG 530 blu ray player and no matter what I do, as when I insert the disc it goes through the 10+ movie previews, about 7 mins of wasting my time. I cannot get to the Salt movie menu until I have watch all the previews. My only option is to skip and wait each preview, you cannot press skip several times, you have to wait until the player has uploaded the next preview, which is really annoying. I have not checked any other blu ray or DVD version of this movie, so I do not know if they are all the same but this version sucks. I am definitively not keeping it."
5,a real thriller,"great acting, plot, storyline. and action which will keep you on the edge of your chair. Builds up to a smashing finish."
2,Mission Impossible Clone,"If you're a fan of non-stop action flicks where the plot is neither important nor makes much sense. then you'll enjoy ""Salt"". This is a film in the Mission Impossible mold. The action sequences are well-shot and often thrilling, but Anglelina Jolie, as Evelyn Salt, is very much a comic-book hero. She jumps onto a moving truck, shoots her way out of impossible situations, falls out of a helicopter into freezing water, etc., always surviving with a few scratches (and looking gorgeous while she does it). And of course, she never has to eat or sleep. The Russians are stereotyped baddies trying to start WW III (how retro!). There's tons of collateral damage, and of course it doesn't matter if many minor characters are maimed and killed as Salt rampages. If you want a couple of hours of mindless action with lots of stuff blowing up, then Salt is the movie for you."
2,Empty,"Empty and boring. Having a famous actress in the lead role does not save one from the boredom of the movie. I guess since I gave Robin Hood two stars this one deserves the same. Why not one star? Believe or not, I have seen worse."
3,Salt Faded,I liked the action in the movie Salt but then I lost interest after I saw that the president in this movie was white. It made me feel like they did not respect the fact that our new presidentis Obama. In the past I would have understood it but in this year and time for a film to come out and their actor is to play the president and the actor is white is prejudice.
1,My top pick for the worst movie of 2010,"I'd really like to rate this -3 stars, but 1 star is the lowest I can go.Zero plot, zero character development. Entirely predictable. The movie is basically 2-3 overly long, boring chase scenes with some dialogue and shoot-em-ups stringing it together. I'm guessing there was maybe a 10 page script for this? I'm really surprised Angelina Jolie went for it. Truly a bad film. She's much better than this, as is Liev Schreiber. I don't think anything could have redeemed the script and overall story. It's simply a bad movie."
1,Salt,"Salt DVD blu-ray was defective in that the sound cut out in same spot, even with replacement DVD. Amazon took return back without any problem. My daughter then purchased the same Salt DVD without blu- ray at another store and it worked great. We did check our blu-ray machine and it works great with other dvd's."
1,Pervasive disgusting language,"Ruins the movie.Otherwise would have been a decent film but the constant usage of ""J**** Ch***"" and ""G** D***"" has completely ruined the movie. What a terrible film.ZERO stars."
1,LANGUAGE IS ATROCIOUS!,"I am really surprised that Angelina Jolie played in this movie and allowed the director to fill it with non-stop swearing!Angelina, put a muzzle on your director for your next movie, please!I mean, every minute there was a four letter word coming out of someone's mouth that made the movie very distasteful.But, here is my big complaint... the PG-13 rating on the movie rates it for action and violence, but does not even mention language. Go figure."
5,LOVE MY ANGELINA,"LOve her in this and basically in any of her work. I purchased Tomb Raider one and two, the Tourist Wanted. what can I say I'm a HUGE FAN OF ANGELINA JOLIE-PITT"
4,Keeps you guessing...,"Salt is an excellent spy thriller that keeps you guessing throughout the whole movie. I think I rented it about 3 times and couldn't get enough of it, so I had to buy it. The movie is intense from the first five minutes, and never slows down. Hope they make a sequel..."
2,fab kotex commercial,"talk about absorption power, bullet wound to thigh, carotid artery might have been more interesting but that would def blow her cover as long as she had that black hair dye...i luv cartoons n superheroes, but not some mangy skeletor who flies, ack this was a mess and i am a big fan of jolie, GIA, Mr n Mrs Smith, etc., have a burger babe, put a bit of meat on them bones n then we can take on an army of super agents and run up a wall like Matrix n skip bullets, least they splained that one w/mental prowess...i dunno ya kiss a ring a day, keep the bad guys away??? PAthetic"
1,dvd format,having purchase a few dvd with out any promblams i am dispointed that this dvd(salt} would not work as the format is not readable in australia
2,Wrong delivery,"I ordered the Salt unrated version with the 2 unrated extended cuts, what I erceived was the theatrical release only, with a few interviews thrown in. The 2 extended cuts were not there. I bought this version specifically because I wanted to see the extended version. I am not pleased with this particular delivery."
3,Angelina Jolie's skeleton as a spy,"Decent enough action flick, but I have a hard time not being distracted by the fact the Jolie looks like she just came back to life and crawled out of a coffin..I cant help but cringe watching her run or fight, it feels like any moment her skeleton like arms or her pencil thin legs are gonna snap..Jolie has some good acting chops, and once upon a time she was very beautiful, but she has wasted away, and she now looks like a skeleton of her former self..Her anorexia distracts from any role she plays, no matter how well made the movie is."
2,Super duper woman who can do everything...,"* She will be the only survivor when a bomb blasts near by.* She can jump from truck's rooftop to another trucks rooftop that to on another bridge passing under.* She can jump into ice-cold water with little cloths and will never have hyperthermia.* She does not need elevator cabin to go down, she can just hop around like a lizard inside the elevator well.best of all...* She can extract 2ml of spider venom from a single spider which is a size of black widow (they are small spiders) using a syringe.the list goes on n on.dumb movie."
1,awful - your time is too valuable for this,You'll like this movie if you enjoy:o hyper-violenceo stilted actingo hole-filled ploto gaping void ending
2,it was a good comedy!!!,"you know guys, i was laughing through the whole movie...it seems like that this movie should have been made 20 years ago, when the russian theme was popular.. was there a good action? well...may be... BUT think about it:1. how did this Orlov came in to the CIA building with the knife in his boot?2. how did he escape from elevator where he was seen killing those agents?3. nato officers entering the white house without fingerprints chesk?4. 1 russian super-spy was able to trick secret service, cia, etc...really?i can say even more, but i won't... overall - don't have great expectations, you'll find some suspense but it doesn't make sense afterwards.P.S. as a russian native i think producers could have had real russian actors, like this orlov who is polish:)"
2,No way out of this film without hitting the fast forward button,"...I saw it the first time, when it was called NO WAY OUT, except Kevin Costner was prettier, or at least his lips didn't look so weird. Did the producers think we wouldn't notice it was a rip off?"
5,Salt,"Ordered the deluxe unrated edition. The cover and disk say this is the extended unrated cut, but it only has the theatrical version. Did I get a bad disk or has Columbia make a big mistake?"
2,Fast-acting nonsense,"The action is impressive, the stunts fantastic. Great movie as long as the viewer's mind is kept in check. If not, the fact that the story makes no sense becomes evident. The defection at the beginning in particular is inexplicable. And since someone was obviously hired to prepare occasional Russian dialogue, how did the movie makers miss the fact that Chenkov is not a woman's surname? As in other Slavic languages, males surnames end in -ov, female in -ova. This is the sort of elementary blunder which ruins the suspension of disbelief."
3,Fast-Paced Spy Action,"""Salt"" is satisfying if you like treadmill action and spies coming out of the sewers. It has action and thrills, with an outrageous plot that keeps popping surprises. Most of the crazy double crosses you can guess, but it is still fun to watch. Angelina Jolie plays the Russian Mole CIA Agent, Evelyn Salt, with gusto. She keeps your interest with fast-paced escapes, clever disguises and turn on a dime attack scenes.The plot revolves around Russian sleeper agents coming to bring down the United States. The agents are brain-washed as orphaned children who are sent to adoptive families in the United States. As they mature and reach responsible positions throughout the country, all come to life as evil agents with specific plans to bring down the USA. Evelyn Salt is the only hope we have - oh my!"
5,Clearly the best action movie by far.,"I'm telling you, SALT is awesome. I don't care what action movie you have seen already . No movie even comes close to SALT in this action/thriller. Sit down in front of your big-screen TV and hold on to your seat. You will yell, screan and holler...You think the Jason Borne movies are good? You think Daniel Craig as the latest James Bond is good? Do you think the Expendables with Stalone & Company was good? You thought the Transporter movies were good, huh? Well they were. But you haven't seen any thing like this movie. Right now SALT is the ""Thrller of Mania"" of action/thriller movies, bar none. Angela Jolie was absolutely superb."
2,Very weak story,I'm getting tired of these Hollywood concoctions which consist of 40 min weak storyline and 60 min of silly cgi fighting. This could have been much better if it where at least a little realistic.
1,Salt,Had to return the DVD as it was not compatible for the United States. Had I realized that I never would have ordered it.
2,Salt DVD,"Hated it! Not only was the action too fake to be believed, the plot was so obvious there was no aticipation throughout. The ending was only marginally unexpected. All in all, it was not worth paying for."
2,Seems Like Yet Another Remake,"Back in the 80's, Kevin Costner made a movie called ""No Way Out."" It was about a man in the US military who was supposedly a Russian spy. Sound familiar?This seems like a remake of that movie, but with a female lead.And they did NOT release this in a DVD + Blu-ray + Digital Copy combo pack. That means spending $50+ to have this movie on DVD, Blu-ray and my iPad. Ouch!!!!!!! Not in my lifetime.I'll wait a few weeks and buy a used DVD of this for under $10."
1,Yawn,"Everything you see here, you have seen it done better before somewhere else. They are all very easily recognizable. Angelina Jolie really should stick to what she does well, whatever that is. She was barely adequate for Laura Croft, but playing a highly trained assassin is definitely not her thing. The action sequences in this one are painful to watch. Angelina seems slow and weak, and simply fling her arms around most of the time, completely lacks the calculated power and cold efficiency that I would expect from a well conditioned spy. The plot has some big holes, but I only saw the theatrical cut, which from the other comments here, makes even less sense than the other versions."
2,Sad Salt,"Sorry, but I thought this was a truly lousy movie. Lots of same old, same old - nasty new age russians, nasty CIA types. Jolie looked ridiculous as a blonde for the first 2 reels, then she ""dyed"" her hair to become the AJ we know and love. But why do the Americans have so little faith in their own government? Their security services are almost invariably cast as duplicitous, conniving manipulators. Lots of action, but - to me at any rate - ultimately soulless, predictable and, worst of all - dull."
1,Needs a Total RECALL!!!,"I have the exact issue same player Vizio VBR100 and the same latest firmware update i even went out and bought a flash drive to download the firmware update to see if that was the problem. I called Vizio and they said they might have to try to develop a firmware for it to play as well, but they are unsure when/if it will be ready. So the movie is just sitting in a draw in my home. I'm not a rich person by any means so i think that this ""bad batch"" of blu rays needs to be recalled and a universal Blu Ray provided for the people who have purchased and been disappointed because some places namely walmart if you open it too bad no refunds only exchange for exact product they even open it for you. They need to make this right with their customers.RECALLUpdate: I had to buy an entire new blu ray player for this movie to work i think that i should be reimbursed for my troubles but i'm sure sony won't want anything to do with that."
5,Absolutely A Must See!,"""SALT"" was the most exciting movie I have seen in a while. I am definitely a movie buff, but lately I have been disappointed with recent films. Then I watched Salt, and I was blown away. I was thrilled that the language was PG first of all. And Angelina Jolie's performance was absolutely stunning. I love the fact that she does her own stunts. My attention was kept throughout the entire film, and I was on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next. I can usually predict pretty much how things are going to turn out, but with Salt, I was surprised at every turn. I would recommend this movie to anyone, even if they aren't into action/thrillers! I give it a TEN!"
3,not bad,"Naturally, the plot does not make sense, but some characters do, the action is non-stop (while way beyond even remotely believable) and the filming is great.Among other things, the plot of the movie includes the notion of the modern Russia as a completely lawless society. It rings so true that nobody notices: Russian career officer on active duty is given an order to kill the sitting president of Russia as a tough but otherwise completely routine assignment."
5,Salt,I enjoy this film every time I watch. A great action film. I enjoyed watching this film at the movies.
3,A James Bond movie with a female lead character,"- It's a James Bond movie with a female lead character.- It has some exciting action scenes but it's so implausible because of Angelina's small body. For example, the scene where Salt jumped over the rail of staircase and choked a bad guy with her handcuffs. So, I watched it with a bucket of salt!- The pace is fast.- The majority of the film is predictable.- In short, it's worth watching once."
3,Not What I Expected!!!,"For some reason, I didn't like this movie as well as I thought I would. The character of Salt changes her personality and looks three times, and I couldn't tell what she was supposed to be, because the movie is pretty confusing. In the beginning, she seems like a damsel in distress, and then later she turns into an action star. While interrogating a Russian defector, he mentions that Evelyn Salt is a Russian spy. The CIA believe it to be true, so she escapes and tries to find her husband to make sure he's safe. During the Vice President's funeral, the Russian President will be assassinated unless Salt can stop it. If you like action movies, you might like SALT!!!"
2,Light weight,If you like action then go right ahead. To take the plot seriously is like having a serious debate with a 5 year old.Disappointing.
3,"I was very skeptical, but it turned out to be a very good movie!","My first thought before ever even reading reviews for salt was that it looked dumb, so I was very skeptical about going to see it, but when I walked out of the theater I was very impressed!The movie starts out with the U.S. interrogating a Russian who claims that a russian spy planted in the U.S. will assassinate the Russian president and that the spy name is Evelyn Salt which is the name of the CIA officer questioning him. Is she the spy or is she being set up? Watch the movie to find out!If I could give this movie a 3.5 stars I would, because it was right on the edge of a 4 star movie! But I have to give it a three stars. I would still recommend going to see this movie because it's a good action thriller!"
3,Thanks Amazon,"I watched this movie because Amazon recommended it based on my past reviews. I have nothing to add to the other 2 and 3 star reviews here. Plot unbelievable, action OK."
5,SALT Movie,Item was exactly as described and a at great price. Item was received very fast and was expertly packaged. Would love to do business again.
5,ACTION PACKED MOVIE !!!!!!!!,All I can say is that Angelina Jolie is great in this film. This movie is action packed from beginning to end. It kept me interested through the whole movie.
4,A little different,"I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this was an entertaining spy/action film. The movie has a plot that comes from an angle that threw me for a bit. Lots of turns and twists, and action that keeps it moving along at a frantic pace. I enjoyed it."
1,Extremely violent.,Extremely violent. Lots of senseless death. Disturbing scenes. Bought it via Video on Demand and ended up deleting it.
1,DUMB,"I don't know what moron wrote the script, but the end result was happiness when I was able to leave the movie house at the close of the picture. Do yourself a favor, skip this one."
1,As bad as advertised,"The very first preview I saw of this movie lead me to think, they were trying too hard and did not have a developed to pull this off successfully. After watching it at a friends house...I was right. A lot of time is spent developing a backround and then bam there is a bunch of action, then an ending. Still not sure why agreed to watch it all."
1,Sick of the Reruns,When in history did they ever make movies with one man going about the country and gunning down bad women? These movies are sexist and I just hope the people who enjoy this trash do not believe in it. I cannot even mention to anyone that I hate these sexist films to anyone because for some reason this makes me a male chauvinist pig. I will never understand why because I do know that there are some movies that were released on the theaters but were never released on VHS or DVD.These films are fantasy and a real insult to men. Someday this may all have an effect or it may not. I do not care. When they start making movies with bad women being gun down by a hero and then they are release on DVD or Blu-ray then maybe things are changing back to reality.
1,Worthless,"This card isn't comparible at all to even a voodoo 3 3000 16 megabyte. Something is causing mine to not work well. Everquest runs choppy, Tribes runs so bad it's hardly playable, and Half Life's load time is doubled. I've reinstalled the drivers and nothing helps. No one buy this card! Pay the extra 20 bucks and get a 64 meg!"
1,The Young Dude needs to be slapped,"a 19 year old fruit cake who thinks hes gangsta...hmm....and from what ive read, Mr. Unibrow never bust no gun and never been through what most real gangsters like The Game and Scarface have been through. i think this guy should go back to school and get a real job, especially when that stupid single Gimmie that is pure garbage and the whole album is nothing new. pure trash, dont support this artist, if you really want the album, download it!"
1,Here's the problem with music today: Webbie.,"I think some idiot told this unibrowed 19 year old ""pimp"" he had talent, but that idiot obviously didn't see him for the stereotype he really is. Webbie makes rap look bad in general. I think ""Give Me That"" should have been given only to Bun B and been on HIS album instead so I would like it better but no, Webbie got away with it. His vocals are bad and he talks about all the same tired things said in all rap albums these days. Except for the good rappers out there, like Cam'Rom, Pretty Ricky, Outkast, Nas, Talib Kweli, Mos Def, Memphis Bleek, Tupac, and this underground rapper called Tech N9NE. Those are rappers with talent. Not this kid. He needs to shave his forehead first of all. Plus he needs to pick up a dictionary and READ IT. It gives you the definition of every word so he can expand his vocabulary past the words ""bling"", ""cars"", ""hoes"", ""bitches"", ""money"", and ""da club"". Any objections to that?"
3,Intelligence Does Not Exist In Our Society,"For Every 4 People That Hate On Webbie, There Is One Person That Enjoyz Webbie Style & Profile. Lyrikally He'z Still Raw & Young But He Has Potential To Move In Da Hot Side Of Rap In Da Near Future. If Everyone Criticize Webbie Cuz Of His Lyrikally Capacity Den Wut Does That Make Nelly & St. Lunatics ""kindergarten Dropout?"" Tha Society'z Hate Only Makez Webbie Stronger & Come Back More Focused. Wun-One"
3,ok but not by south standards,im from texas and listen to mainly underground texas and tennessee and have to say that webbie is aight but yea u needs a broader scope. he only 19 so he aint got the street life of say Z-Ro or Gangsta Blac. these r the TRUE kings of the south. HOLLA
1,what the f***?,"this rapper is so crap, and his album is worseim not a hater but im just givng my opinion. i think the reason why weebie is so crap is because he doent have any talent at all but only decided to put an album out because he saw how down south music was gaining popularity and he was hoping to make some money out of it.dont get this crap.if u want to hear real talented southern rappers, check out:B.G , Soulja Slim(RIP) , and any Cash Money albums"
4,Decent for first big release,"Whats funny with the previos review is that hes from detroit, so i take it he hasnt heard the underground stuff, but what most people dont know is that he did grow up as a thug and that most rappers today didnt, but anyway its a decent album for his first big release, but doesnt compare to gis undergournd stuff."
2,Bangin,"No doubt this CD is bangin. But thats where it stops. Webbie ruins the beats with his unrhythmic flows and repetitive lyricism. Wouldn't recommend this CD. All the tracks are bangin, no doubt, but none of them are worth having unless u get em as instrumentals. Ride Banger, Brain clanger."
1,How did this album get to product?,"One word and one word only - crap.All this guy does it say bad words in a song. Say nonsense and nonsense over and over again. I have no idea why some people like this guy.Just save your money, save your time, save your ears, and do not buy this album."
2,hot beats with wack rhymes,"don't get me wrong some of the beats on this cd are tight but the lyrics are also whack as hell. all he talk about is bling, cars, sex and money and its not like i dont listen to other artists from the south like the geto boys and ugk. i dont know why pimp c signed this kid but webbie just aint doin for me"
1,Ignorant Country Niggas,"This type of music makes me embarrassed to say I love Hip hop.....The south has offically ushered in the ""its cool to be ignorant era"" but not to worry real niggas iz still out here, southern rappers have no talent and are real wack of there are exceptions Outkast,Common (chicago) what eva....any way someoneburnedthis cd for me and I listened to it just to see where todays hip hop is (I listen to mostly old school New York hip hop you know official sh#t) and I laughed after the first song but I listened to the rest of it what eva. I can't wait till the south era is over so we can get back to making real music. One love to tru headz"
5,Lil Webbie On Fire,Lil Webbie is one of da hottest rappers in da streets right now. Dis album is 100% gangsta and every song is tight. He puttin Baton Rouge on da map wit da help of his partner in crime lil boosie.No one else doin it like dis.He's all da way Trill. Before I hear dis cd I stopped listening to rap because horrible rappers like 50 cent Nelly and Bow Wow were on tv and da radio all the time. all yall lames out their hatin on Webbie need to kick rocks cause he hot.Hottest Songs1.G-Sh*t2. How U Ridin3. What is It4. Bad B*tch5. Gim Me Dat6. I Got Dat
1,Oh!!!!! it hurts please stop!,"Now you see from the title I am actually polite in saying ""please stop"". This is ridiculous. Where did webster come from and someone please slap the clown that gave him a record deal. This is another example of superficial subject matter, poor rhymes and perfectly wasted beats. Webbie please wrap your hands around your own neck and choke yourself."
3,where is my 2 cds?,i bought this item only after i read there is cd this star removedis there any one can help me?the book is good for beginner but not absolute beginner so i remove star
3,Be Careful!,"The book description says that the new edition has ""2 CD recordings."" Alas, the book arrived with no CDs. Apparently this refers to a different edition. I'm returning it--I specifically wanted something with an audio recording, as I understand that the pronunciation is crucial when attempting to speak Turkish."
4,Don't Buy Without the Audio CD,"I recently bought this book for a long stay in Turkey. It refers to an audio CD which it says comes with book. There was no CD in the book. So, if you buy this book, be sure to also order the CD."
3,What...NO TAPE????,"The joke must be on me...I bought a copy of this book a year ago from another source. After using and liking the method of teaching, I really needed/wanted the audio part of this, now I know, NON-set.So, I see the book here on Amazon and in a rush, seeing the words audio in the description, add it in with my other ordered items, thinking this is the book and tape set.....WRONGO..... Even though I could return the book, I am now the not so proud owner of two Teach Yourself Turkish books. And my Turkish family will continue to laugh at my accented Turkish!"
4,Wonderful book with a few deficiencies,"This book is GREAT! It is very encouraging and teaches you A LOT of Turkish in a short, informative course! While I sincerely love this book, there are some things that it lacks:1) once in a while introduces a concept that has not been taught earlier2) sometimes has words that you can't find in the back glossaryBut, other than that- HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
3,Good watch for the price,"I was looking for an inexpensive watch that sets itself via US Atomic Clock signal and found it in this watch. I love the indiglo light feature. The face does get scratched up a bit if you bang it against stuff. I like the cloth band with velcro. Being cloth, the band does absorb sweat so it will need to be washed with mild soap periodically. Not a bad watch at all."
5,Atomic Timex,"This is a great watch. It picks up the atomic time signal without any problem and is just the right size, not big and bulky. Now I don't have to worry if I've got the right time."
4,Enjoyed very much,"I've loved Lori Wick for years and eagerly devour her books. This one was no different. I had it read in about a day, not able to put it down. It was heart breaking and brought tears to my eyes as well as gave me a few laughs. I would recommend this book to any Lori Wick fan."
3,"Fair, but I've read better WWII romances!","This book offered a sweet story line, but was drawn out with insignificant information and not enough romance! The main couple in the book got less couple time, it seemed, than one of the supporting characters and her romantic interest! And in my opinion, while Lori was on board the ""Every Storm"", the details about socks was a bit overdone! Still, the book was enjoyable and decent, which is a must if I'm reading romances!"
2,Losing her touch,"Boring, predictable, and just not that great. If you want some good Lori Wick, try her earlier stuff."
1,Worst Lori Wick book I've ever read,"Every Storm by Lori Wick definitely could've been a lot better than it was. Out of everything that I've ever read by her, this is by far my least favorite book. When I opened it up and read that she'd had the idea for this story for 10 years, I thought to myself, ""This should be pretty good if she's been thinking about it for that long."" Unfortunately, that was not the case. The story was so chopped up, and it didn't flow well at all. There were breaks through the entire book. For example, at the beginning of a chapter, it would be a Sunday. By the time you turned the page, it'd be the end of that week. I think if she had developed the plot more, even making it a longer book (Pretense comes to mind), I think it would've been so much better.Unfortunately, it will probably be a very long time before I read another Lori Wick book because this one just did not impress me."
2,Not her best...,"I am a BIG fan of Lori Wick. I have read most of her books. I found this book hard to read. It took me a long time to get through it. I usually eat up her stuff. The book was just a bummer in my opinion. I usually save the books and reread them but this one I didn't bother, I donated it to the library."
2,I couldn't finish it...,"Usually I love Wick's books and have sincerly enjoyed her tuckermills books and have read all of her other novels, enjoying Pretence and others the most, but this book was terribly hard to get into. I actually couldn't finish it and gave it to my husband to trade for commentaries (He's a seminary student). I was really disappointed, because when I learned Wick had written a WWII novel I was excited, but my excitement was misplaced."
1,Lori Wick,"I can't stand Lori Wick books. I used to love them until I realized that real people are nothing like her characters. All the women are gorgeous, all the men are handsome, caring, and wonderful. THERE ARE NO REAL MEN OR ANYBODY LIKE THAT! Her books are just fairy tales that would never come true in real life and I don't plan on wasting any more of my time reading that garbage."
3,An Odd but Interesting Read,"Set in the 1970's, a white man has a one-night stand with a young black women only to find out years later that she became preganant and had his son. In addition to this she and the boy have become members of a militant cult-like black power movement. Motivated by the need to get to know his only child he joins the group as a servant. This is an unusual story about power and race."
5,HOMETOWN BOYS,I THINK THE HOMETOWN BOYS ARE THE BEST CONJUNTO MUSICIANS OF ALL TIME. EVERYTHING THEY PUT OUT IS IN MY COLLECTION.
1,Death of a Prophet: A waiste of film,This so called documentary was terrible. It lacked content and did not do justice to the memory of Brother Malcolm. It came across as a film school project.
2,but not the record company,"Though the song is a strong one, and the photo of Morrissey as a priest is hilarious, the thought of spending this kind of money for two songs is far more blasphemous than anything.You are the quarry, indeed."
4,Stanely: The early years,"The reason this book seems to suddenly stop half way through Stanley's illustrious career is that it is part 1 of a two-volume biography. For part 2, see Stanley - Sorcerer's apprentice also by Frank McLynn.McLynn's biography of Stanley is well researched, and worth reading. McLynn describes it as a ""psychobiography"", and he attempts to read between the lines of the historical record to a certain degree to ""uncover the inner man behind the explorer's mask"". It's impossible to say now, more than a century after Stanley's death, how close to the mark he came, but this first volume in particular should probably not be taken entirely as unvarnished fact. His ideas about Stanley's character are certainly well presented and defensible in any case. If you want a fascinating read, get and read both volumes.The Last Hero by Peter Forbath (I think) is another extremely well done novelization of Stanley's Emin Pasha expedition. Someone needs to make a movie."
2,This book ends prematurely,"This book is a fresh take on Henry Stanley and well worth the read. However, the book ends right after his second exploration, quite literally. For a book that poured over Stanley's early years, many pages to his 7- and under years, the paragraph (literally) that sums up his knighthood, authoring of more books, marriage and subsequent adventures is pretty disconcerting. It is like the author died and someone else tacked on an ending and called it done."
1,T-28,"I purchased this book for reference in the construction of a scale RC model of the T-28. The photos are not as clear or detailed as I had hoped. This is an okay book for some basic history of the aircraft and its' deployment in the USA and Internationally. However, I can't say that it was any help for copying detail for model building."
5,Great Album!,"All of Eric Martin's albums are amazing, but this one truly standouts. It is so honest and you can really feel each and every song.The standouts for me on this one are Over My Heart, Fly On a Wall, Wink and a Smile and Something From Nothing. But they are all great.This album is sure to please any music fan!"
5,Great album,"Eric is surely one of the most talented singer I've ever heard. Great record, you'll love it !"
1,"Buyer Beware, Not as Advertised!!!!","Please do not purchase based on the dimensions Sabrina Silver advertises. They are NOT 10mm wide and are a lot closer to 3mm (all other dimensions are correct). I had contacted the seller numerous times but they refuse to change this information and will not refund my shipping costs even though the product is misrepresented and the pair I had received had a hinge (not the post) that was defective (hinge was not filed and very sharp to point where you could pop a balloon with it). I was looking for a very small but wide huggie earring and going by the dimensions thought this was the pair I had been searching for, it was not. For anyone looking for a wide silver huggie earring, Stuller makes a great quality product and worth the extra $$. I will never do business with a company that thinks you are NOT entitled to a full refund for a misrepresented, damaged product that they send you."
3,Nice But SMALL!,The earrings are not bad for the price. However be aware that the earrings are really small. If you have earlobes that are average or above average size you will not like these. Nice hoops for a child or adult with smaller ears. Mine are small but they barely have room to move.
1,Huggies won't Hug,These earrings were exactly as pictured but the one earring would not hug and I would loose the earring. The seller did offer to replace if I would send them back.
3,A teacher's opinion,"I used this book for a college freshman composition course I teach. I liked it and found the essays useful. The students didn't respond quite so well, but then again, they don't like most anything that requires thought...."
4,Basic but reliable,"These headphones are pretty basic but they are reliable and backed by Koss' limited lifetime warranty. I got my first pair many years ago, in kind of a slate color, and when the headband actually snapped in half, Koss replaced them, no questions asked, with the current black color. They are pretty comfortable, even when worn for a long time, and the sound is good for a lightweight headphone. You won't get much isolation since they rest lightly on the ears and not around or in them, so they won't block out loud external noises, but I used mine all through college for private listening in my dorm room and around campus and they held up through that and beyond. The relatively high impedance limits their use with small portable music devices, but should be fine for use with computers or shelf audio systems.Specs: Response range 20-20,000 Hz, sensitivity 100 dB, impedance 60 Ohm, straight cord, dual entry."
2,snapped,"I've only owned these headphones for 2 months and I really have been enjoying them. The sound quality is so much better then the quality of my previous headphones, however after the first 2 weeks the right side of the head stap broke and tonight the other side has just snapped. With electricians tape I have put them back together until I can find a better pair."
5,SEXY & MELODIC!,"Ladies, if you have not seen this guy play in person, you really don't know what you're missing!! He is so sexy!! Andre Delano gives true meaning to Sexy Saxophone Player!!Full Circle is an Awesome piece of Work!Sally"
3,Helpful book,"When we are entering into a new activity based costing project, it is mandatory for the whole team to read this book and obtain the lessons learned in one of those implementations explained."
3,Misled,"Specs say it is 1"" thick. It arrived 1/2"" thick.Description says 1/2"". I didn't read this part.Confusing. Returning it."
1,Grey & White Blues,"Remember this old series from when I was young boy. Good price for entire series so I ordered it. Excellent shipping service and new set of DVDs. Unfortunately the quality of the episodes was so poor as to detract significantly from viewing. Understand it is old Black & White - but this is almost White & Whiter - or White & Grey. The sound is also uneven and I only watched one complete episode and scanned others before returning.I have other older TV series and I expect some color, film and sound distortion, but this is not worth viewing."
5,26 Men- 20 Episodes,I love the shoe and feel it is a classic western tv series.I grew up watching it and it tells of the Arizona Rangers in their fight of crime in the old west. I would recommend it to all western fans and wish I could get the complete series.
5,Az.,I didn't know about these men until I watched this DVD.Very good true stories.Old film but copied as good as can be expected.Worth watching priced right.
5,Love this tape!,"I've ordered this tape several times, and I love it. For my scrapbooking needs, I need a double-sided removable tape, and this one does the trick. You want to be careful, but it actually is removable without tearing anything it's stuck to. And I like that one side is covered. It helps me get the tape on and be able to trim easily before I remove the covering side. It's a little more expensive than I'd like it to be, but hey, as long as it works the way I want, I won't complain too much about the price."
2,Advice-column pop-psych attack on religion,"Although I am an agnostic and have posted reviews critical of religion, I cannot agree with the idea that a belief in the supernatural is the same thing as being crazy. Worse yet, Ellis is notorious in my mind for vulgar, slangy pop-psych advice-column approaches to mental health issues, using words like nutty, kooky, etc. I find this extremely unprofessional. Ellis comes across to me as a shock-jock dumb-downer and popularizer, an attention-seeker."
1,EXTREMELY anti-religion,"As most of us are aware of, Ellis is ver very anti-religion. This book exposed his attitude perfectly. If you are an atheist, you may side with him. However, his attitude will sure make Christians or any one with a religion of any kind to view him as terribly stubborn and NOT open-minded.In days of tolerance, he sure is NOT tolerant of religious people. (Perhaps to him, tolerance means anti-religion.)"
1,case against religion,Case Against Religion: A Psychotherapists View and the Case Against ReligiosityThis is the most amateurish analysis I've ever seen. Redundancy after redundancy. This Psychotherapist needs psychotherapy.
4,Great early/rare sounds from The Orb,"This is a valuable release for fans of The Orb, especially their early sound. The booklet is very informative on the early history of the band and has a very detailed discography of all Orb-related releases. The two tracks on the CD are both AWESOME - both very spacy and about 15-20 minutes long each - and are the best way to hear the development of The Orb's trademark Ambient House sound. It's actually closer to the sound of The KLF's first album, CHILL OUT (one track features Jimmy Kauty before he split to form The KLF). The music is like listening to a late-night DJ mix on your radio's coolest college station. The sound is slightly rough, but if you like this sort of music you probably won't care. It's definitely worth a listen."
1,"I say ""No"" not to hurt, but to educate.","If you have a lot of Orb's music, don't bother. The recording it's self even has a low quality. What it does have is history, that is to say it was one of the Orb's earlier recordings. That is about it. To the random consumer who is remotely interested in the Orb, purchase any album or disc but this one."
1,Just because OBLIVION was good...,"End of StoryPeter AbrahamsI looked forward to Peter Abrahams' latest, having thoroughly enjoyed reading OBLIVION last year. But at the risk of getting myself blacklisted at First Look, I must express huge disappointment in END OF STORY.The reader doesn't have a chance to bond with the main character, Ivy, at all, before the flimsy case is made for her falling madly in ""love"" with Harrow. Her shortsightedness gives a bad impression of writers being unable to think rationally, only imaginatively. It was like watching one of those ""B"" horror movies, when the female bimbo decides to wander off into the woods by herself, and the entire audience is yelling, ""Don't go in there!"" simultaneously. END OF STORY is the literary equivalent of a ""B"" horror movie.The ""ha, fooled you"" ending might work for a short story, but I felt gypped after having invested the hours necessary to read an entire novel. Abrahams, I want my four hours back!"
1,horrible,"I read this book while on a trip to Africa. I actively search out fast paced books with at least one intelligent character and a compelling theme. The reviewers (back cover) seemd to support my thought that this book was worth a read. I don't think I've ever been so disappointed: slow start, poorly developed characters, an ""intelligent character"" that was anything but, an author character with zero writing skills, confusing mid-section, and a drink of water for an ending. I was so disappointed with the book that I actually left it on British Airways backseat pocket and hadwrote a note to the next reader: ""don't waste your time"".The only thing that is actually a mistery about the book is why a few people rieks their names and reputations talking it up. Total lies.Finally, this is the very first time, I've ever written a review about a book. Normally, I won't waste my time. However, in this case, I felt obligated to warn potnetial future readers.Don't read. You will be gravely disappointed."
3,Fast but lightweight,"This sleight but well-paced novel is about a fledgling female writer/bartender who stumbles upon a miscarriage of justice. A man is in prison for a casino robbery he didn't commit and his wife has been missing ever since the crime. Did she throw in with the handsome rotter who somehow managed to come up with the scratch to open his own casino? The would-be writer learns about this story when she gets a job teaching English to prison inmates. The story suddenly branches out into a police procedural that becomes so jammed with detail reconstructing the crime that I stopped reading. Nice up to that point, however, and others whose tastes run in that direction might not mind."
3,The Protagonist is an Imbecile!,"I read the entire novel in just a few days, yet the lead character, Ivy, was so incredibly dumb I was actually wishing she would get ""whacked.""I felt the ""surprise"" at the end was obvious all along, and agonized over the fact that this writer (in the book) could not write.However, I gave this book a three-star review. How did that happen?End of Story was very well written, with no hint of the protagonist's hesitant over-thinking (which I started looking for in Peter Abrahams'own work.) The plot moved well, and the locales were interesting. There was an air of humor in some of the scenes and the entire story just never lagged.In conclusion: surprisingly, I will read another of this author's books in hopes that he draws a character that I do not want killed. Combined with his storytelling talent, and great forward motion, the next review I write on Peter Abrahams just might be a five-star."
1,Dopey,"I am not normally a fan of ""suspense"" novels, but I was hungry for something to read, and this was mentioned in The New Yorker. It was silly and unbelievable...(The New Yorker must have mentioned it because Abrahams mentions The New Yorker). I do confess, however, that I finished it. I think I was hoping for some fantastic twist to explain the silliness."
2,Never gets off the ground.,"I don't understand why some supposed ""thrillers"" get such wonderful reviews. This book has a good set-up, but the protagonist's actions are so insipid, they're unbelievable. The ending is almost as bad as Donna Tartt's equally overhyped ""The Little Friend"" ...that is to say very uninspired, lazy, and ultimately a huge disappointment. If you want a great thriller about a writer, with terrific character development and a non-stop plot that actually has you caring about what happens, get John Colapinto's ""About the Author"" and you'll have a much more satisfying read."
3,"Starts strong, fades fast","I enjoyed this book for a while.The set up was intriguing and I expected some interesting character development and suspense.Instead, the book became more and more far fetched and silly as it went along.Barely mediocre."
4,A magic key to understanding the Greek New Testament!,"The editors perform a much needed service to all those students of the New Testament who can't remember the marvels of Koine Greek morphology and syntax. Each word of the Greek New Testament is analyzed in terms of tense, number, person, gender, etc.A simple alpha-numeric code provides the key to parsing any word.Companion volumes by the same authors use this analyzed text to provide lexical and grammatical concordances of the entire Greek New Testament.A most useful study companion for students and scholars alike."
2,"cute, but not very sturdy","The bookends are very cute, but they do not hold many of my son's books on his dresser."
1,"""Encyclopedia"" is a misnomer","I ordered this book as a gift for my 7th grade grandson. What I had in mind was a dog encyclopedia with a lot of pictures and information on various breeds. This book has no illustrations at all and is a topical guide to caring for your dog. Not exactly a coffee table attention getter (even for a seventh grader). For that matter, encyclopedias are usually long. This book is quite short.For an adult who wants good practical advice about caring for a dog, its obviously very helpful. As a gift to a kid, its a dud."
3,Not for Me,"The story of Muriella, a young heiress, and the political drama surrounding her in the quest to control her lands and fortunes. Although there were several sequences in the book that were imaginative and held my interest,the incident with Elizabeth in the water and the funeral, but for the most part I found the story bleak, depressing, and finally, boring. Try as I might, I could not find the emotional thread of the relationship between Muriella and John. I found the book rather odd, as the writer was qualified, but somehow the story was bogged down - over written and too long, and suffered a lack of emotional drama - - that's not to say the words were not on the page, but it didn't evoke a connection with this reader."
5,Well worth the price!,"This well organized DVD covers calls 1 through 30 on the Caller Lab Plus list. The caller, Paul Place, explains the calls clearly and conducts walk throughs with enough repetition to explain the moves without being tiresome. The demonstrations by ""The Travelling Hoedowners"" are also clear and easy to follow with nicely color coded costumes and excellent camera angles.All in all a very useful aid in learning the plus calls and, as noted in the header, excellent value..."
4,best muzik dvd of the year,brilliant concert live at there best as usual. commitment no other band in the world give you what a live show gives you. i never wanted the dvd to end but like all good things you never have enough.
5,"Live, Live At Last!","With little hesitation did I pre-order ""Live At The Paradiso"" when it was announced. I've been a fan of Live for fifteen years, so I was pretty excited to finally see a live DVD come out. After watching it several times, the only complaint I have is the quick-paced editing is a little too hectic at times. Also, it would have been nice to see ""Mystery"", ""Run To The Water"" and some other songs in the setlist. Other than that, it's a great DVD! ""They Stood Up For Love"" really comes to life in this format..."
5,Fantastic concert DVD!,"I first saw LIVE at Philadelphia's Tower Theatre when promoting their first album... and have seen them several times since. Easily among my top five bands of all time. This DVD is very good quality, and the concert itself is brilliant! The venue was perfect - intimate and energized. The audience was super-charged, and that energy easily transfers to the viewer.One of the best concert films I've seen, and a must have for any LIVE fan."
2,"Had it, lost it","I was a big fan of Live from their early work all the way through most of V. After that, the songs seemed to lack musical appeal and lyrical luster. I think that's why all the guys started gaining weight. They were probably depressed that Ed kept getting douchier and douchier.There was a time, however, when they were an awesome band to see perform live. I had a number of bootlegs and saw them in concert. So, I know it. So, when I saw they had released a formal live dvd, I had to buy it (even having youtube to preview it). The band is great. Ed's voice is great. But, the performance is so overshadowed and distracted by Ed's self-congratulatory persona that it is mostly unwatchable. It's too bad, Lakini's Juice, Operation Spirit, Mirror Song... there are a lot of good songs on this dvd. But, they definitely seem more like a band like Ratt playing lots of little venues based solely on former glory. And, certainly, the 180 on the lyrical content of Operation Spirit... sad."
4,"please put ""entire"" show on here; how leave off run to the water?","shame on you live, we have been waiting 15 years for a full live ""live"" concert dvd, and you leave off one of the most powerful songs ever written in your repertoire????have been looking forward to this since it was announced you recorded both shows in Amsterdam, and then to find out you ""cut/edit"" out some of the showwhat a disappointment!!!!!"
4,"Great DVD, but should be a double dvd","Great album, great atmospherethe only negative point is that talking about a band with 7 studio albums, is very difficult to sumarize a hole career in one dvdsongs like pain lies on the riverside, run to the water, ghost, century, waitress, tdb, white discussion, call me a fool, iris etc should be in the other dvdLive is a great band, with really great tunes, the 17 song were excellent, but I really wanted more!!!"
3,good product.....small size,"Good product, only it would have been helpful if the oz would have been listed. It is much smaller than I had expected."
4,Mixed feelings but overall a very good read...,Garcia's prose does not disappoint; it is beautiful and engaging. The narrative was less gripping than others by Garcia but I would still eagerly recommend this title.
2,"Interesting idea, terrible end result","I generally prefer reading reviews than writing them, but when something excites or upsets me I want to share it with the world. Garcia creates interesting outlines of characters and, in my opinion, utterly fails to deliver them to the reader. I have to write a response paper on this and all I want to say is that she has no clue what she is doing and that it should be used as kindling. It's obvious that she can write, and some of the passages are beautiful and engaging, but overall the characters don't come to life and I am kept wondering - what on earth was the point of this book? Blah."
1,Simply silly,"What Tammy overlooks is that the Executive, Legislative and Judicial brances of government, as well as the media, are controlled by the right, not the left. Instead of trying to divide America we should all be working to unite it. Hate sells books, but it is destroying our country."
4,America as the Indiviual's Idea,"I've read Ms. Bruce's prior books, and I've found them educational, illustrative and enlightening. Do I agree with all she postulates, no; but she supports her thesis with sundry examples, citing sources for an enjoyable read. She stipulates that America is not limited by the boundries of geography, but is boundless and grows with the idea of the individual to pursue happines with responsibleness, however they define the American Dream. I found her Toolbox sections beneficial for futhering my growth and development as an American citizen."
3,Hurts to write this because I'm a huge fan of Tammy Bruce,"I expected this book to be as hard hitting as ""Death of Right and Wrong"" with the same kind of examples and documentation, but I was dissapointed. There's a lot of ""ra ra"" stuff up front, and when we get to the meat there was very little that I didn't already know about since I've been reading political blogs since before the 2004 election and am quite up-to-date on what Tammy and other ""classical liberals"" (conservatives by today's standards) have been thinking and writing about.This would probably be a good ""first Tammy Bruce"" book for a lot of people.At least I'm reviewing her book and not her politics."
1,"Third rate ideas, little depth.","Passage after passage, she uses limited characterizations to describe the people she is defending (""hard-working, gun-owning, hunting, church-going, blah, blah, blah"") against the 'hatred' of people she uses unfair characterizations to describe (""liberal, atheist, America-hating, blah, blah, blah"").It's the same old ""elitists"" against the ""simple folk"".What this nation needs, is one less hack writer, rallying one way of life and thought against another.Tammy, try to come up with a useful career goal. Something other than whipping up resentment."
1,a silly book,"Ms Bruce actually believes that the United States invades countries like Iraq in an attempt to disseminate our values, such as democracy. Never mind that our own statisticians show that 80% of Iraqis want us out, yet we remain occupying their country. Even Gen. Casey has stated that the primary cause of the Iraqi insurgency is US occupation. She actually believes the war in Iraq makes America safer, when our own intelligence estimates show that it does not.But inconvenient facts will never dispel Ms Bruce's muddled devotion to her zealotry. Her take on the United States in international affairs passes all understanding."
5,The prequil to Driftless,"As good of human narrative as I have seen. If you like this book, read Driftless next. Ps, the ending worked for me, but then I read Driftless first which is the order that I would recommend. Rock Island and Driftless are two books separated by 35 years. Amazing."
2,Get to the point,This book is like one of those people who insists on giving you every little detail and all of the detours in what could be a straightforward story. It has its moments but it takes forever to get there.
3,A Beautifully Written Book But A Disappointing Ending,"(Spoiler alert- I give away some of the plot in this review) I think that this author has immense writing talent and crafted a wonderful book - for some people. That said, I think that for me the ending was unworthy of the rest of the book. The boy is beset about the largest tragedy that can happen to a child and the rest of the book is about how he slowly learns to deal with it -almost totally on his own. But to then throw in an equally immense tragedy to end the book with seems to negate his entire journey makes the journey seem for naught. Along the way, there is also the loss of the closest he comes to a friend to suicide. If the point of this book is that life may present us with horrible events over and over, then it accomplishes that. I hope that this author's sequel - Driftless - does not use his talents in a similar fashion."
1,"Preposterous, odd story","A lot of odd things happen to a strange leading character. Most of them unlikely. The characters do weird things without obvious motivation. The first 80 pages should have been trashed. This book desperately needed editing. Here's one sentence: ""Perry pulled up a chair beside them and lit up a cigar he'd taken from the pocket of his pants which he'd been chewing on earlier that day.""I think I'll go chew on my own pants for awhile..."
5,Excellent Summary of QM,"For someone interested in understanding quantum mechanics on a historical and conceptual level, this book does an excellent job. There is limited reliance on math, and the text is clear enough that one can even gloss over much of the math that is there.Importantly (I think), is the even-handed portrayal of the standard interpretation of QM and how it's apparent acceptance in the mainstream is neither historically nor logically fully supported. The assumption that because reality appears to follow the mathematical formula does not necessarily imply that the interpretation of the formula 'explains' the basis of reality or even that QM constitutes the most basic level of reality.The author uses many quotes, but always in a way that fits in nicely with the storyline.Although, ostensibly written around a critique of Everett's contributions to QM, the author seems more to use that more as a reference or counterpoint for his own exposition of the problems and issues regarding QM."
5,Pirate collection,I purchased this for my grandson's 5th birthday. He is a pirate fanatic and this added to his collection of pirate toys. He plays with everything for hours on end. Would recommend for any pirate lover chilPirate
5,EXCELLENT BOOK,This book explains about herbs used in the Ayurvedic traditions as well as their uses and dosages. It is a book to go back to again and again while you work on your health and the health of your friends.
2,MOST INCONVENIENT AND NOT USER FRIENDLY BOOK !,"I would have given 5, if all the herbs are combined in one section in alphabetical order. Every time I have to look in all three sections to find the name of herb. The section do not even match with listed herbs.I hope they publish new edition with only one section with all the herbs in alphabetical order. No one is interested to know which is commonly available or which is special oriental or which is special Ayurvedic and Chinese!!!"
4,Good Book,"I found this book to be very informative, and thought that it provided a good basis for integrating plants into a spiritual life, though I am no expert."
4,The contour is nice but the paddng is a little too hard...,"I have had mine for over a year now. I use it daily, and during that time it falls off my keyboard about once every half hour. I guess I could glue it on or attach velcro to the back, but I simply put up with it. I have had other hand rests, but this is the best one I have used. My hands are such that I cannot type without one. I think they could have done a better job making it feel more like there is some actual gel in there because it feels hard and this is not comfortable. Considering that ergo keyboards are on a slant, I think they could have designed something to keep it from slipping off. For the money I think it is way overpriced. So actually I am not happy with it because I am always having to fuss with it. Still, it is simply the best I have found and the contour is good and which is a real plus."
5,this is the best version,when i was little my family used to hide this movie from me because i would want to watch it over and over. this is the better version with Jiminy cricket narratingi cant express how much i love this movieMC
5,Family Traditions,Bongo is a classic miny Disney Classic that I grew up with as a child! As finding this VHS for a decent price was difficult; I persued it to share it with my son! It is just a great movie to carry on with all your family traditions! As family is the most important element in everyone's life.
4,Just Bought Bongo Today...,"... It is a very sweet Disney film, about a cute little bear wanting to be independent, but he learns that being free also has its struggles... It's also humorous and affectionate... Anybody who would care for a smile on their face, should choose Bongo... It's not my favorite movie, but... It's still nice."
1,Doesn't work well with windows xp,I installed this on a pentium 4 with windows xp. I updated the drivers but the card would not work with windows xp. it worked fine on windows 98 and my old pentium 3
5,Great Help to training my Gun Dog,After reading this book I have many more ideas to train my gun dog and it provided a lot of helpful resources for building a training table and such. I would recommend this book to anyone who will be working on training a gun dog of any type.
5,A great place to start in training a hunting dog,"Joan Bailey's extensive experience in training hunting dogs, especially the versatile breeds, shines in every chapter of this now classic book. She teaches us that the key is truly helping the pup develop itself. The only thing that will help more than this book is actually getting the dog into the fields and coverts themselves. My wire-haired pointing griffon buddy and I recommend both highly."
5,This should be the bible of dog training.,"This book is eye opening, gives the dog a lot of credit for figuring things out on his own, in my mind turns out the author is justified. Very satisfied, opened up my eyes on giving the pup a lot more leeway. After 8mo. I can say the system is sound, I used it on a rescue pup with some trust issues and at 1 1/2 yrs, 8 of those months with us, he had himself an awesome season. Started out a little slow, but as he went he learn, then he had one day where he just broke out and never looked back. Very satisfying to see where he came from, to where he is, I am convinced he would not have responded to heavy handed training."
5,How to Help Gun Dogs Train Themselves,"After 40 yrs of fuzzy faced versatile hunting dogs, I start with a new dog by reading Joan Bailey Training book. It always makes me remember something very important to the bringing up of the best hunting companions and it comes directly from Joan's book.Two copies of Joan Bailey's book are on my book shelf waiting for the excitement and pleasure of helping a dog train it's self.Try it, it works for me with my dogs. Jack Dallimore"
3,down and dirty,the video looks very low budget but the quality of the editing from george cotayo is very good it has rythm very straight forward documentary about the rap industry. rap fans should defenitly see this video. all great rap artist have humble beginings.
1,the one that i got didn't work at all,"when i plugged it into the usb port, it immediately started shaking and making noises which is absolutely not within any regular operating range. i returned it, so i don't know if it is just a rare incident, or the manufacturer lacks basic quality control."
2,Not as accurate as other models,"I have used a few different models and brands of instant read thermometers, and this model hasn't performed to my expectations. I realize this is instant read and it takes readings from the ear, both of which make it less accurate. But taking several readings within a minute or from both ears would reveal a great variance in temperature (3-4 degrees). That's unacceptable for me. I got a Braun instant read thermometer and it takes much better readings (consistently gives the same reading within a minute and is close, around .4 or .8 degrees to standard thermometers)."
2,Inconsistent,Inconsistent readings. Think the baby has a temp. but the thermometer gives four different readings in two minutes. The range is 4 degrees. Same result when I try it on myself.
1,I do not recommend this,"I bought this almost an year back. Recently, I took it along to our pediatrician's office for my kid's visit and this devise under reported fever by 2 degrees F. This was after multiple readings and taken by me and the nurse. So I do not recommend this at all."
1,Pure JUNK!!!,"I recently had a fever of 104 but when I used this thermometer few seconds apart I got readings of 101 to 102.5 in one ear and 102 to 104.5 in the other ear. Who wants to have to guess which reading is the correct one.Pass this one by, it's worthless."
2,Operator error or just not accurate?,"I really like the ease of use of this item. My problem lies with the different results I get. I can take what I think are identical readings in one ear and get slightly different results. Then if I compare with readings from my other ear the numbers get even further apart. I just got an oral thermometer that tracks pretty well with an ear thermometer at our doctor's office. The Mabis ear thermometer will usually be 1-2 degrees different than either of those. I can't rely on it, which is unfortunate because I really love the backlit screen, memory settings, travel case it comes with, and how it beeps to indicate when you're running a fever."
1,Broken out of the box,"Bought one of these a week ago at Meijer. Opened it tonight and read and followed all the instructions. It failed the very first self-test - the unit only displays ""Err"". (The instructions helpfully suggest that this means the ambient temperature is not between 60 and 98 degrees F - I'm pretty sure the temperature in my house is in that range, Mabis.) Tried replacing the battery - no better. The unit is just junk."
2,apparently all temps UNDER 98.6 are reported as 98.6,"It appears this thermometer assumes your temps are 98.6 or higher - I have consistently lower temperatures which I want to monitor and this thing keeps telling me '98.6' which I know is incorrect. SO, not good for anyone with low thyroid or adrenal issues, or anyone looking for basal temps."
5,One fine elbow,20 words? Well I can say that the metal was shinny and the angle was right on 90 degrees and the size was correct. The big box stores don't have these things so that is the reason I ordered it from this fine outfit. Thanks
4,a good fit,"We bought this to divide space in a Steelcase overhead storage bin between 2 part time student workers at our office. Not the typical use for this product, but it's just the right fit for the space and has worked perfectly for us."
5,3M Extra-Wide Adjustable Monitor Stand (MS90MB),"This product us sturdy, of high quality and easy to assemble. It is a great help in organizing my limited desk space."
5,Near Perfection,I read all the previous reviews and order the stand based on them and I have to say every one of them was dead on the money. This is an amazing monitor stand and the stock photos really don't do it justice. So simple to use and adjust to what you are comfortable with. It's beyond sturdy and even though it's plastic it's extremely gorgeous and compliments the computer and speakers very well. Even if you don't end up using for your computer monitor it's truly multi-functional. You really just can't go wrong with this product.
4,Versatile and Reasonablly Priced,"3M's Monitor Stand is very easy to put together (parts snap together...no tools required), it's versatile in height and sturdy. It looks great with my computer equipment and the price is very reasonable!"
4,exceed my expectation,"got this stand because I needed something to prop up my monitor, a recommendation from my chiropractor to correct my sitting position... it was pricer than most stands but I thought the adjustable height is a must... with this stand i'm not slouching anymore and force me to have proper posture... would recommend looking and trying it out if you are in the market for one monitor stand..."
1,3-M monitor review purchased at Amazon.com,This was much much larger than I needed or wanted. It was way too big. I wanted something about 1/2 that size.
5,Great Product,Great monitor stand. Does exactly what I was looking for. Highly recommend. Was impressed by shipping as the product arrived on time and in original packaging.
4,Nicer than you'd expect,"It's plastic, but its still nice. Would be better if it had a more upscale feel, but it serves its purpose, and really de-clutters a desktop by allowing junk to slide under the monitor, reclaiming the wasted space.They are great for the people in the office who complained about their necks having to look down at their monitors. It also looked much better than the piles of random office junk (reams of paper, 2x4's, empty boxes) that people commandeered to raise their monitors to eye level.You can spend a lot more at binder-tech or ultimate office buying a nice wood stand, but for the money these can't be beat."
3,"Does not work for Samsung 23"" all in one computer!","This product states it is 20"" wide, so it should have worked for my Samsung all in one computer because the 4 rubber feet at the corners of the computer are 19.75"" apart. However, because the sides of this stand have a convex shape, the corners of the stand are actually only 19"" apart. Therefore, my computer's rubber feet hung off the sides of the stand. So, this product does not work for my all in one computer, but it should work perfectly for monitors."
4,Monitor Stand's Other Use Works Well,"The monitor stand was purchased to act as a cover for a surge protector/battery backup and its maze of wires connected to it. It works very well to protect those things from dust, and makes for a much neater appearance on my desk.Assembling the leg parts and connecting them to the platform takes a bit of patience as the components are upside down as one works on them and don't always stay in place.It has not been used to hold a monitor but with the weight of a monitor holding it down it should be stable enough by virtue of gravity."
1,Not as expected,"This was a really disappointing purchase for me...it just wasn't what I thought it was. I thought it was a workout using a hula hoop, standing and hooping. It is mostly used as a prop."
3,Victories against great odds.,"The author Bryan Perrett seeks to give the reader ten unlikely victories which were against great odds. Most of these victories are little heralded in modern history (with the possible exception of the commando raid on Normandy) and so present the reader with fresh perspectives on ten little known battles. All of these are land battles, so those interested in naval history will have to look elsewhere. Such battles described included the taking of the Taku Forts, the march into Palestine by the British, the relieving of Lucknow, a Hill fight in Vietnam. All very relevant, but all little known.All these victories are relevant, but somehow I lost their relevant importance in the great scheme of history. The author tries to impart this in some of the ten stories, but fails in others. I consider this an average read in history. There are other books out there that cover important battles better."
5,A must read for Soldiers and commanders,"Bryan Perrett is a good writer, most of his book I have read, however the one writing as “encyclopedia” are not a good as the book written from the military and Soldiers point of view, overall I will recommend most of his books for an informative and riveting historical reading."
5,Smell so good and gentle.,I love this soap. It is so gentle for my skin and smells so sweet and heavenly!
3,beautiful,"This is a beautiful ring, dainty but very sturdy and i can tell that it will stand to the test of time, but the sizes run small. I wear a ten, and this ring, in a size ten will barely go on my finger and is not wearable. They do not offer it in a larger size, so i am out of luck. Very disappointed. I have been loosing weight though, so i will hold on to it for a while, it should fit soon so i guess not all is lost. Just sad i cannot wear & enjoy it now."
2,Obvious why these are cheaper.,"While these are ok for lounging, they will not keep you very warm. As other reviews state, these are incredibly thing...so much so that you can easily see light coming through them. I wouldn't even think about playing any kind of sport in these, unless you consider chess to be a sport."
3,Not quite what I wanted but okay,"I purchased two pair of these to replace two existing pairs that I had purchased a hundred years ago. I actually thought I was getting the same pant but the material in these is NOT the same jersey knit I was expecting. These are more an ultra thin knit (if a knit at all) and, while the original pants were lightweight, which I liked, these are thin to the point of worrying me that they won't last a year.I'll have to see how these wear to decide if I would buy them again."
4,Comfortable!,"I really like the fit of these pants. I recently bought 7 pair. I'm 5'4"" and a size 12 and I buy the large. A couple of pair I didn't need to hem, the rest I did, sometimes by as much as an inch difference between one leg and the other. So, quality control could be better, and yes, the material could be heavier. Pockets would be nice. But the price is very reasonable and they're very durable - I wore my previous ones for 4 years and they're still in good shape. I'm an older, retired woman and I spend much of my time in these. Most around-the-house-pants I've bought dig in at the waist and/or ride up in the butt and/or cut off the circulation in the groin area when you sit for a while. These pants do none of those things; in fact, you can put them on backwards and they're still comfortable."
3,"Nice and comfortable, but overpriced.","The pants are comfortable, neither too thin nor too thick, nice material, just about what I wanted. I bought them for $14.99, I guess it's a little bit overpriced."
3,Gym Pant,"These pants are light weight and good quality, but run large. Mine were way too big so I wear them around the house and use as sleep pants."
4,very cozy,"These pants are very compfy. I've washed them several times and they havn't balled up or faded. The only thing that I dont really like is the higher waist of womens 'vs' mens pants, but thats my own fault for not thinking of it. Other than that I love them!"
1,Maybe gym pants if you are going to a bar afterwards.,I purchased this product to in fact wear to the gym but they were way too tight. I returned them.
2,"Way massive, thin material.","I ordered one size up and these were so large they stretched several inches below my foot. I'm going to have to cuff and hem them. (I'm 5'4"" , wear 14-16 and never have this problem with length in XL.)Also, what's up with the crappy thin material? Like cheap pajama bottoms. I had a pair of these from several years back and the material was quality fleece, lasted very well. With these I don't expect more than a season or two out of them. I wouldn't wear my actual size because they aren't flattering and show every lump and bump, but a size up and they drape a bit and provide at least some modesty.I'm not going to return them because they will *work* under a big shirt and I'm not finding anything better out there. But this is really the last clothing I buy from Russell."
2,"Very ,very thin material","These pants are light and comfortable, but the material is very, very thin - just about see-thru thin. The fabric may hold up well, but I'm not planning on wearing these out of the house, the material is just too sheer for me to feel comfortable in public with them. The pants I got are the oxford color, which is not 100% cotton, so other colors might not be as bad. These do have a very polyester feel."
2,Entertaining because it is so odd,Not my kind of music but we all were laughing because he is an odd fellow. He sings both male and female vocals in all ranges. The female vocals are pretty lousy! I'm pretty sure he has done this on purpose just to be funny/odd. But maybe not . . .
3,Review on demo!,"I was running this on my 2 ghz pc and i couldnt see menus or cut scenes. I checked and my system requirements were up to the standard. The game was fun, but the first level got frustrating after a while. All i can say is make sure you're video card is above 32mb. (mine is excatly that)"
5,This is the BEST book on price theory ever written.,"A serious book for serious students - no glossy pages, no color, and not a single wasted word. Friedman's book is the most authoritative and definitive textbook on Price Theory around. The material may be more difficult than some textbooks but this is, after all, economics Chicago style. Price Theory offers a rigorous and demanding treatment of the subject, exactly what a serious student should want."
2,Bought the wrong edition!,"After being assigned Price Theory by Milton Friedman, I eagerly purchased a paperback version published by therichestmaninbabylon.org in 2008.Price TheoryUpon finding that 3 of the problems assigned by my professor (from his old copy of the 1976 edition) were not in the book, I read the reviews more carefully and found that this version is probably a reprint of the 1962 edition and not complete with Friedman's thoughts and analysis as of 1976.Amazon needs to note which edition the new paperbacks are reprinting! I would not have bought the book if I had suspected that it did not have the full information from 1976."
5,Cute Little Huggies,"These are very cute and also tiny.Initially when I put them on the tiny bar wasn't snapping into place and they were loose.Finally when I readjusted them , they fir fine and I sleep with them and haven't had any problems.These are neat,but tiny and great for someone who likes a close fitting earring or wears more than one earring."
4,Too soon to tell.,"I received the item on promptly and on time. I tried it in my container garden. The plants started growing new dark green leaves as advertised. However, weather in the 30's wreaked havoc on my garden and have yet to bounce back. So... I'm not sure if this product is working. This review is based on the short time of improvement I experienced. I will update the review as the weather improves during spring."
4,Memoir 44 extras,Memoir 44 is a superb combination of board game and war game all set in WW2. This is a double sided board for use with the various Memoir 44 expansions like 'Mediterranian Theater'. One side is the desert (sand) and the other is winter (snow). You get nothing else when you buy this and the board is of the same quality and size as the original Memoir 44 game.Its only an essential purchase if you have bought the expansions to the original game.
4,"A turkey, but very well cooked","I was expecting to see a bad movie, but I have to confess I was pleasantly surprised. Even though the comedy moments are a bit dated, the main storyline moves flawlessly and the actors are likable. DVD quality is superb, the picture and sound clarity are perfect and the colours are amazing. The musical numbers and especially the ballet sequences are enjoyable and strikingly avant garde for 1938. All in all, a very pleasant hour and 50 minutes indeed."
2,How can it be this bad?,"There are some redeeming features to this film. Gershwin music. Talented performers. Adolph Menjou's wardrobe. Otherwise, it could be greatly improved if they had eliminated the plot, the so-called acting and lame jokes. I remember very well 1938 when this film was made, and it had to be just as bad then. I doesn't suffer from age, the viewers suffer from the trite plot and corny episodes. It would be less than 1 star without the Gershwin music and some of the musical interludes."
3,More of an extravaganza than the script merited,"11/6/02 I've seen this extravaganza thanks to ""BlockBuster'video as it was before my time....I felt than it was too much of an extravaganza...of muscial renditions with a minor story plot;however based on when it was meant to be seen (in the late 1930's) when movies had more domainance than audience's financial ability to be entertained by musicians at the better clubs or renown theatres, as time goes by more and more we will apreciate the efforts of our first movie moguls,movie entities and movie actors,actresses and the studios's 'cast of 1000'..we're considered lucky when they clone certain scenes in animations with & thanks to modern technology(e.g. movies on dinasours).11/6/02"
5,Fascinating account of world series history,This book is definitely for the sports enthusiast.Easy reading and very informative.I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommendit to anyone interested in baseball trivia.
3,Fun concept---flat writing,The idea sounded good- I really wanted to like it...but while reading it I found it to be a yawner.
1,Have not received the item yet. HELP,I have still not received this item. When will it be sent? It was out of stock over one month ago. Is there a problem with this item? How much longer before it ships? Please email me with a response. Thanks Larry
1,Not a Durable Toaster Oven,The first oven didn't work at all. The second of the same model would not get hot. This product is not durable - the fram is flimsy and not assembled properly.
1,burnt toast,I don't like this at all!! It burns the bottom of things before the top is even done toasting. Save your money!!!
5,Got It -Love It,I replaced my toaster when we remodled our kitchen and decided that this model had a lot to offer. It takes up just a smidge more counter top than the toaster I had and does a lot more. I feel I will be saving on my electric bill using this product rather than heating the whole oven. Very happy customer!!
3,Lasted for a while,"My toaster oven was mounted under the cabinet. It worked ok for four years. The coils on the top started to droop & then it stopped toasting on the top. It gets really hot. I need space in my kitchen so under the cabinet was a plus. B&D no longer offers toasters under the cabinet & I wonder if this is why? I think because it things burned in the toaster, it set the cabinets on fire...hence a fire hazard. I understand that! With all the reviews towards the manufactuer being negative on many sites, I am opting for a countertop of another make. I chose the Sanyo SK-VF7S Digital Convection Oven, Stainless Steel Finish. Its $93.00, about the same price as my old toaster. It has no broil, but its small & sleek. I will review it once I have had it for some time."
1,Day two and it was toast!,"Looks great on the counter, however if you actually want to use your toaster oven for ""toasting"" skip this model. I have used it twice, the first time the toast button didn't want to stay in at all, the second time it got stuck in and I had to unplug it from the wall!"
2,"Product might be good, but I received duds","After many years of receiving good products through Amazon, this one was, sorry to say, a dud. twice. The first Toast-r-Oven was received with the knob assembly and chrome behind it pulled away from the body of the toaster. Amazon very quickly sent a replacement but this one had the toaster button stuck in the 'in' position. Toasted a piece of bread to see if the button would come 'out' but it didn't. We're returning this one too. The toast was nicely browned though, so if you get a good one, keep it!..."
1,3 STRIKES YOU'RE OUT!,"Originally bought TRO3100 8/04. After 3 months the top stopped toasting. B&D; sent another as it's under warranty. After 3 months same thing happened and replacement sent. After another 3 months same thing-now guess what? 3 months later same thing and another is being sent. The crappy thing is you go without a toaster oven while they send you a new one, as you have to send them the plug to prove your warranty. NO MORE B&D; for us!!I want my money back so I can purchase another brand but they say no way!!"
1,They didn't work,"I bought one of the TRO3100... it did not get hot. I cooked hamburger for over half an hour and it was still pink and room temperature inside.I was sent another one, it broiled, but the bottom heating element did not work AT ALL!As a replacement, I was sent a top-of-the-line CTO8100 and this big powerful oven does work, but the 2 TRO3100's were total duds.I hope you have better luck with yours..."
2,Beware problems with electronic toast button.,"I've had two of these, and will not buy another. The electronic on/off switch for the toast feature failed in both...right after the warranty expired, of course.It's a shame, because the machine has great features, works well (except for the electronic feature) and is easy to clean. But now it won't do toast, so...it's toast."
2,disgusted,"We've had this toaster oven for about 5 months now. We've mainlyuse the toast mode and occasionaly bake/broil mode. The toastbutton finally broke. It's stuck in the ""in"" position and we can't get it unstuck. Don't buy Black & Decker houseware, theydon't know or care what kind of product they are making."
1,Bad luck with B&D,I had one many moons ago. It was a piece of junk. It wouldn't toast correctly or consistently and it wouldn't broil correctly. On the other hand it did last for at least 12 years. Right up until the day I took a shotgun to it (after buying a DeLonghi .... but that's another story).
2,On off failure seems to be a general problem...mine too,This toaster oven worked excellently at first. Soon the you had to hold the on/off button in longer and longer to engage the toasting function. Finally it stopped working all together. The oven works very well but doesnt make up for this obvious design flaw in the product...I suppose this product would be one to avoid seeing the amount of the same type of failures...I think I would be hard pressed to reccommend this even with the excellent customer service of black and decker and the replacement of the product. I don't think the inconveince is worth it.
1,Don't buy it,"I received this toaster oven as a gift. Nothing about it works consistently. The timer only works on occasion. The oven heats very unevenly. And even though we keep the toaster set on the ""medium"" setting, sometimes the toast is burned and sometimes it is a barely warm piece of bread.I have generally had good experience with Black and Decker products, but this toaster oven is a piece of junk."
1,Not happy with mine.,"It toasts unevenly. When toasing a bagel with the dial on full dark (just below top brown) it just barely crisps it. I then have to wait for it to cool down sufficently so that I can press the start button again. Also, the start button is so hard to press that I have to hold the back of the oven so it doesn't slide across the counter."
1,Cheaply Made Toaster Oven with Nice Styling in Black,Bought this unit but must return it since it is so cheaply made the door does not even close evenly and the thermostat does not function correctly. I tested it at 400 with an expensive oven thermometer. I set the oven at 400 and it rose to 450 and was still rising when I shut it off and unplugged it. Don't waste your money on Black and Decker. It is one of many B&D products I have bought or have been given that is cheaply made and does not work correctly. It was a good brand 20 years ago.
1,Stay away from Black and Decker,"I have bought many B&D toaster ovens over the years. However, in the last 4 years, the quality has gone seriously downhill. Screws are missing, toasting is erratic and uneven.The finish is peeling off. My daughter had to return two new ones within two weeks. I am about to buy a Cuisinart. B&D is an abomination!!"
1,Piece-O-Junk,"This Toaster oven is really a piece of junk. I have had earlier versions of the Toast-R-Oven for years and years. This one feels cheap. Not only that, but at the highest ""Top-Brown"" setting, you are lucky if it just warms the bread up. We are returning it, and buying something else."
2,not good enough,"I, too, had the black toast button not work. It is also stuck in the ""on"" position. Ours is just over two years old. Our children have complained about that button since we first bought the oven. I don't use it a lot but won't get another one."
1,SAMS - Teach Yourself COBOL in 24 Hours,"I TRIED to install the programs that are on the CD, and the problems began, that was about 6:00, at 9:30, I finally gave up and did an XP Restore, YES it was that bad.During the installation a dialog box asked for the serial number on the CD. There wasn't ANY number, not on the CD, not on the CD-holder, not in the READ-MEs, NO NUMBER.So, I did an uninstall, that didn't work.When I rebooted, a MS NOTEPAD error occurred and about 4-5-6 programs opened and cascade-failed. The messages were ""insufficient memory"".I couldn't access GOOGLE, to send an e-mail.NOW, after an XP Restore, the PC seems to be back to normal.I HATE THIS CD-BOOK combination.For me, NOTHING worked.Now that I can access GOOGLE again, I'm going to e-mail ""SAMS"" and RANT.- - -I hope you don't have the same experience as I did.- - -Do a System Back-up BEFORE trying to install the JUNK on the CD.G. H. Montesano, WA"
2,cd-ROM defective,"After numerous tries at installing the compiler (chapter 1), we have tired of the computer freezing up, looping and telling the names of files over and over and not doing anything worthwhile at all. I'm returning the book and cd-ROM immediately."
4,Very good book for little money.,"I am about in half of the book and I must say it is an excellent book. The compiler is good as well, considering that it comes free with the book. The examples are very good and are based on real world problems. So you not only learn the theory but also gaining a knowledge of solving real world problems. The language the author uses is understandable to anyone who can speak English just a little (BTW, English is my second language and I did not experience any difficulties to understand what author means at all). The only minus I found was that the book almost completelly omitted the debugging, which is essential if you want to be a true programmer (in any language). However, the combination of theory, excersices and free compiler makes this book and excellent buy for any COBOL novice like myself."
4,Easy read - lives up to title,"I'm sort of cheating on this one; since Thane works for me I get to see the book way before y'all do! It will actually publish at 500 pages or so due to the great depth to which he goes into each topic. In spite of the length, it goes quickly.I like his approach, with lots of examples, and his use of the most current COBOL standards, combined with 15 years of business experience on mainframes and PCs. His advice makes sense, works, and can be easily expanded upon. Even though I've been writing COBOL for 30 years, I learned some ways to improve my program structure.I evaluated the book with the idea of using it as a text for a 4 credit hour Freshman or Sophomore class in compter science and found that it should do nicely, in fact the proposal is on the Dean's desk right now, with a request for Spring 1999 semester introduction."
4,Very good COBOL book.,Very good introduction. They compiler is a little dated but the text is excellent. Knocked out a fairly large project after one read. The chapter on random file access is exceptional.
4,a great book with its own compiler,"I found this book to be great. It help me with a quick answer guide, to write cobol programs."
3,Only 3 stars for this perfect album? Yep.,"This truly is a perfect album. It has the typical production values of a Carl Jackson product, the instrumentalists are all fine, A.N.'s voice is all you could ask for, and yet there is something missing.There is a by-the-numbers feel to this album. To me, you can tell that this is not a band that has had a long on the road invlovement with the songs the way, say, the McCoury family has that shows up in their CDs. A.N. has written none of the songs herself and I would guess she chose few of them herself. In fact this seems to be another CD produced to get more Carl Jackson songs out into the world.If the singer hasn't chosen the songs her/himself and has only a studio time involvement with them, and if the band hasn't been playing the songs for a long enough time to really get a feel for them, then you get an album like this: perfect, just fine, clean and somehow not a keeper.I'd love to hear her first album."
2,Poorly Done,"The book has plenty of test questions but, as said before, are completely outdated, poorly written and often not reflective of the exam. I should have not been cheap and gotten the $200 book on SWES."
1,waste of money,this book is loaded with typos and references programs no longer in existence. don't waste your money buying this book to study.
5,SW Exam book,"This book offers test taking strategies and practice tests for the Intermediate test. It lays out subsections of specific topics to ""brush up"" without having to pull out your old text books. The book is well organized, and user friendly."
4,Great product,"I can find very little to criticize. And the price is right. A way to keep the hooks from moving would be nice. The wood is waxed, and nothing sticks to it."
1,Too Old,"the chipset in this card is 3 years old, It will not run any of the newest computer games even on the lowest settings. For 45 bucks you could probably buy an old GeforceMX or a Radeon 7000, or pay a little more for a 7500. This is not worth it at all"
4,Its OK.......,"i bought this card after realizing i had to send the agp one back because i have no agp slot. When i bought it i thought i was in for a joyride with grpahics. I am running a K6-2 476mhz, 224 megs and this card with win 98. I can run some games but other games run choppy like empire earth it runs at like 11 fps. Can someone please email me or post a way to get my fps higher or tell me how to fix this. i have the drivers onstalled off the cd and downloaded the latest."
2,poor performer,"The rubber ""massage tips"" did nothing to enhance the process (in other words, it doesn't feel anything like a massage), but they do hinder the effectiveness of the bristles; you have to push harder to make effective contact between the bristles and your back because of the rubber tips. Another problem was the weight: for such a simple implement, this one weighs quite a bit. But by far the biggest problem is the detachable head, which detaches with nearly every use. When this heavy thing falls from shoulder height to the shower floor at 6am (again and again), you can imagine the reaction from a sleeping spouse."
4,Bath/massage brush,"This brush is great. I had a similar one previously but did not remember the name, so I had a difficult time locating another one. The hair bristles could be a little stronger. The curve of the handle is good, but it is so slick once it gets wet or because the soap runs down the handle that it is difficult to hold onto. It would be nice if the handle material could be modified somehow to have a better grip when wet. Otherwise a GREAT brush. I bought extras to have one to take when traveling and one to keep at our lakehouse."
4,Great,"I have never seen Bobby Rush perform before but, after watching this dvd I can say he is truly a great entertainer! I didn't get bored watching this because he kept you laughing and his dancers were also good. Fun to see the women shaking what they got! Interesting to see Morgan Freeman come on stage dancing."
5,BECAUSE I CAN'T GIVE 6,"You talkin' about a show. Bobby Rush went to Morgan Freeman's Ground Zero, took his band and his dancers and tore the roof off. Bobby gives you the show and you can't keep your eyes of the girls. OH BOY! Can we have another."
5,sturdy brass fireplace tools,Beautiful set of brass tools for my fireplace. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality for such a reasonable price. Highly recommended.
2,A Glorified USA Today Accounting of a Terrorist Network,"If you pay attention to the news, read newspapers and/or news magazines then this book will add little to your existing understanding of this group. The book does a very good job of detailing the minutia of the al-Qaida membership. Inasmuch as the membership list is important, maybe to the CIA, the minutia was a lost effort because most of the membership biographies were very short and cryptic at best. I bought the book expecting that it would articulate the group's activity, financiers, State sponsors, directions, goals and ideological underpinnings. The title lead me to that conclusion. The book does not do this and for that reason I was dissapointed.The only high point of the book, for me, was the re-print of bin Laden's speeches. Pass on this book."
1,For researchers only.,"This is a great factual book and should be presented as such. Thoroughly documented. A series of valuable facts that, unfortunately, are not correlated to each other. The aim of the writers is not clear. Except maybe for some web sites, this ""fact sheet"" gives nothing more than what is broadcasted every day in the media. The choice of documents is not explained. A big minus: many typographical errors. The publisher, not the authors is to blame for that."
5,An extensive inside look!,"While this book predominantly focuses on the middle-eastern terror networks of bin Laden & Co., it does provide an extensive inside look behind the scenes of the workings of these organizations. Excellent research and detailed analyses make it an interesting read as vital information is communicated, including a portrait of the mindset of Osama and his friends. It's an excellent resource on the subject!"
5,A superb guide to the Al-Qaida and its people,"The layout of this book provides easy reference for those who need a knowledge of terrorism at their fingertips. Professor Alexander has written extensively on terrorism, a subject the knowledge of which is in particular demand after the recent bombing of the WTC and the Pentagon. He and his think tank cohort Michael Swetnam provide us with a methodical account and a carefully reasoned set of assumptions and expectations for terrorist acts past and future. The author's are knowledgeable and credentialed in the real world of policy studies and politics and they provide an excellent primer for professional and amateur alike."
3,Reference Journal,"For the historian of the time period, this will be an excellent source document . . . a listing of all the characters known to be involved, documents, etc."
3,Usama bin Laden's al-Qaida,"An ok read that's generally informative. Too many issues are left unanswered for a truly focused look at this dangerous organization... but, the information that is presented is well researched and viable within those limits."
4,Indo-dance supreme,"Graduates of MP3.com, NatarajXT, on the recently formed NuTone label (subsidiary of Canada's Nettwerk), put on a great show, mixing the traditional Indian sarod, sitar, and esraj with electronics to produce a series of tracks that vibrate, pulse, flow, and move in perfect East-West fusion.Nataraj is one of the names (and incarnations) of Shiva, from the Hindu pantheon (Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva). While Shiva is often referred to as the Destroyer, in his Nataraj form he is Lord of the Dance, and these guys sure do a terrific job of paying homage to their namesake. One of the most popular musical cultures to be associated with worldbeat/world fusion, Indian music can just as easily be diluted and considerably weakened as it can be hugely enhanced.Because they're sharp guys, NatarajXT knows this, and they reflect that knowledge in their music. This is one of the better examples of Indian-influenced worldbeat, for sure."
2,An Adventure in Pattern Theology,"This is an excellent book for those who wish to have their preconceived notions about Pattern Theology bolstered. Individuals who believe in this hermeneutic will cheer, and individuals who do not support this hermeneutic will groan. Unfortunately the author does not do anything to get beyond ""playing to his base"" by trying to address questions like how one selects the portions of scripture one will include in the authoritative pattern to be followed, or how one should deal with honest fellow Christians who do not see the same pattern in scripture which is so obvious to the author-except to mark them as simply being wrong.I was hoping this book would take a fresh look and ask some of the hard questions. I was disappointed that it did not."
4,GREAT VALUE FOR PRICE,"I purchased this player in January initially as a replacement for a 5 disc CD changer. I went ahead and purchased it because it played DVD's as well. I use a Yamaha receiver to power it. I use the Optical DTS and Dolby Digital outs for sound and run S-Video to the TV for video. No need for any RCA's. The optical cable is perfect for CD's too. I am happy with the 500 line resolution since I don't have HDTV.I also agree with the other review that it makes a little noise when you play the DVD's, but it is doubtful you will notice that unless the volume is all the way down."
2,problems with reading discs.,"The unit worked well for about 8 months. Read all supported formats without difficulty. After about 10 months it started having trouble reading commercial CDs. Often spits them out with an error message or says ""No Disc"". Still works well with DVDs. I notice that some Sony units have exhibited similar problems."
5,8.5 years...still going!,"Received this for Christmas in 1999. It has been demoted to bedroom use, however it gets plenty of play and I have not had one problem with it. You'll obviously never find one, but if you do for a few bucks, pick it up! You won't be disappointed!"
3,Pioneer reliablity... HAHAHA!,"I'm using this as the CD player in my studio with a Pioneer VSX-D411 receiver, I needed a Pioneer DVD changer because the VSX-D411's remote is not a universal and has controls for only a Pioneer DVD player, so I had to look to find a Pioneer DVD changer that was cheep as it is not in my primary system.The sound quality is good, unfortunately it has the typical ""bright"" Pioneer sound to it, although, when I had it hooked up to my Yamaha receiver, the sound went from bright to flat.overall I like it, and the video is dang good too (had it hooked to my TV for a few days).Perhaps you are wondering why, if I like it, the three stars?Well... half the buttons on the front don't work, and at times it refuses to play CDs.If your not heavy in to sound this should be a good choice."
1,Beware of Pioneer,"Like others who have posted here, I have also had a bad experience with Pioneer. I had to take my Pioneer LD player to the ""authorized service center"" (which was 100 miles away) twice in a two year period. After it quit for the third time, it was out of warranty. Pioneer refused to do anything about it, but would be happy to sell me a new one. I will NEVER buy another Pioneer product!"
1,Great DVD Player until the laser goes bad.,"This DVD player worked great for me for about a year. After that, is stopped reading DVD's. After reading the other reveiws here, I can see I'm not alone. It's too bad cause I have had a hard time finding another DVD player that lets you go directly to the disc you want (ie, press Disc 5 instead of pressing Disc Skip a bunch of times)."
1,Laser pickup on its way out,"After about a year and just out of warranty I've also had problems with the laser pickup.The unit no longer plays any of my CDs, after reading the other reviews I'm expecting the DVD laser to quit soon.Excellent sound and picture...... while it lasted. Wouldn't touch another Pioneer product unless they were giving them away."
4,Rather maestoso performance,"This Tchaikovsky 1st concerto performance is rather slower and more ""like"" maestoso indication on the score.Sviatoslav Richter played little bit faster and more passionate, Gilels then played slower, glorious and in calm. Every note is clear with some finger-slips again. The Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra with Evgeny Mravinsky was the best orchestra/conductor in USSR. The strings are full of power and wildness unlike some easter europe orchestra. But woodwinds are lack of some brightness.The Tchaikovsky sonata Op.80 is a bright performance. With Gilels' control of the keyboard and calmness when rising to the climax.Overall, this CD is worth to listen."
4,Gilels,Rare !Little known music (the early Sonata) played by Gilels. How could one possibly resist it ? Tubby recording with slight distortion on climaxes.The concerto is slower than one would expect with Mravinsky conducting.Go for it!
3,useful but lacking instructions,The Car charger arrived and there was no instruction about how to gauge its effectiveness. I figured it out ofr myself but it would have been helpful to have had some instuctions or a website to obtain information about the product.
1,Book in bad shape,This book had been written in and words crossed out. Inside the cover was written a grocery list.
3,Caffeine is stronger,"For the money, a good green tea is a stronger stimulant. This gives no noticeable boost of energy. I'd rather spend the same money on a good coffee roast or a very special non-herbal tea. It tastes OK, like a nondescript mild herbal tea, maybe close to a chamomile flavor. Not special enough to order again, seems a long way to ship box by box, one order at a time."
4,Good practice,This book is good practice and accurately reflects the realGRE. Since it's written by the same people who write the test it givesa fair representation of the content. The only negative is that there is only one pracitce test.
1,"Great tape unit, bad warranty policies.","I run a small IT shop with a few Linux servers, around 100 users, and a few web sites. To avoid multiple tape loaders, we switched from DAT to the VXA because nothing else could touch the price/performance ratio of these drives. Tip: pay very close attention to the manual regarding the tape drive door.Nonetheless, we are abondoning our entire investment in these drives. The problem is this: if a drive is completely dead, Exabyte will issue an RMA. If a drive has intermitant problems, they will not. Our last contact with tech support resulted in them stating that we could have the drive repaired, but not under warranty.Before purchasing, I received good advice by others who had the same miserable experience - which I promptly and whole-heartedly ignored. Shame on me."
3,Eh.... it's not as good as i thought it would be.,"being Renaissance and all. i expected something along the line of deep dishe's release or even dave seaman's masterpeices. that is why it's called the master's series.the first disc is the obvious start up. really chugs and chugs and doesn't really go anywhere. flat sound. when people say it sounds fresh they mean the tracks are all new. some are old though. the higlights of disc one is track 1,5, and 8. the rest you mgiht find yourself skipping.disc two is of course the more uptempo one. but also chugs and chugs and goes no where near dance status. some tracks are cool though. so......"
2,Disappointed,"I'll say it: I did not like this album, even as a big hernan fan- it is BORING. But this is the strange part: alot of these other reviews compare the sound on this album with hernan's live sound and say they are similar. I strongly disagree. I saw hernan in January, 2004 at centro-fly in NYC and his set was WAY more energetic than this renaissance compilation. Objectively, I know renaissance puts out a good product, in fact sander kleinenberg's everybody is my favorite dance release. On this CD, however, as sad as I to admit it, it sounds like boring MU-ZAK. CD2 is obviously better, with some of the medium paced deeper progreesive tracks he spins live. But he was just a different guy live- a DJ on fire...energy, fast BPM, knowlegeable crowd that appreciated him- I don't get that same vibe on this mix, and it puzzles me that other reviewers compare the two."
3,Above Average But Nothing To Get Excited About,"This is the first commercial production that I listen to by Cattaneo. I must admit that I have been impressed by the majority of his live sets that I've listened to. Probably why I expected a little more from this one.Predominantly falling under the progressive house genre, there are a number of very good tracks over the two discs, but just as many mediocre ones. Compress this into a single disc and it would have more of an impression.Both discs get 3.5/5 stars."
3,Better than Vol2,"There's some wickedly cool stuff here, but I feel that all of it could have just fitted onto one cd. Not a bad buy."
3,not really good,"natturally i have to compare this new hernans album with the old one ""south america"" .i expected an atmospheric album close to deep and sexy sounds.this one antouched me and dissapoint me.i believe that hernan is one of the best coming djs and you will agree with this if you hear his first mix album'i hope that this album wiil be the only modest cd of hernan"
3,It's good...sure,This is a solid showing and definatly keeps the bar raised on the Renaissance series. Money well spent.
3,Oakenfold? Is that you?,"Well, it looks like Señor Cattaneo has finally succumbed to Oakenfold's label and his newfound unmotivated, uninspired, unimaginative ""talent."" Naturally, one would compare Hernan's new CD to his previous one, expecting immaculate track selection and unparalled mixing. However, that's not the case.CD1 reminded me of 1970s porn background music with hints of rock at some instances. It was very mellow and downtempo. Any more unimaginative and it would border elevator music quality.CD2 was more fresh and upbeat. There was nothing that wowed me; nothing that made me want to shake my head in anticipation of the next track. All tracks were plain and simple. 3 stars is generous and no, playing it louder is not gonna help!I just hope that after Sandra Collins' KILLER Perfecto mix, she doesn't become a brainwashed pop artist wannabe such as Oakenfold and Cattaneo."
2,Big Disappointment,"With Kasparov's name on the title page I was looking forward to analysis on par with his other Pergamon/Cadogan books on matches 2 (New World Chess Champion) and 3 (London/Leningrad Championship Games). I was sadly disappointed. The analysis in here is very weak, on the level of what Keene usually provides in his hack jobs. I recommend the book by Karpov's team (ISBN 0812919238) instead."
3,Color not as pictured - not orange but blush/rose,"This is my first Amazon review; I depend on others' reviews so want to return the favor. My kids are on a no-food-chemical, thus dye-free diet so I'm happy to have found a natural decorating sugar for them, but wanted to let others know that the color is definitely NOT the deep orange pictured, but a medium-light blush/rose color. HOWEVER, my kids (and myself) are just happy to have something to decorate their cake/cupcakes with since everything out there contains what I believe are petroleum-based dyes (red #5, yellow #6, etc), and it is a pretty sugar, just not the color I wanted (I have sons, do I did not want pink, which this basically is). I knocked off one star for the high price ($8.88 for about 1/2 a cup!) and one star for the color inaccuracy."
5,Great value for kids.,"This is just what a youngster needs to go golfing on the par 3 course. Didn't have to spend too much money, either. Real steel clubs, no plastic. Not too heavy, with its own carrying case."
4,Nice little cage,"I just bought 3 of these in various colors (aqua and neon green) I will be using mine to house some young snakes, until they are old enough for larger tanks.They are roughly 8.5 gallons, and offer the same floor space as a 10gallon tank, but with a lower profile. The partition is a nice touch as well, but will not be used in my application.I take off a star because they are not the most secure of cages as the lids can be a bit too loose, I will be having to modify mine a bit before use but it's not a big deal, a few zip-ties and some crazy glue should be more then enough to fix any issues I will be encountering.As is, this would make a great enclosure for amphibians, small terrestrial lizards like leopard geckos, and invertebrates of all kinds. I would recommend the tubs for rack applications as well since they are already ventilated, and are much easier to see into then sterilite containers. =3"
4,Aerobics for kids,"Fun,fun, fun. This is a great exercise program for young children. I regularily used it with five and six year olds. I only used three fourth of the activities on the disc but it was as much fun and exercise for the adults as it was for the children."
4,Great graphics at a great price,"This is a great card. I upgraded from a Voodoo3 3000 and am very impressed. Did have one installation problem, but it was probably due to Windows just as much as the card. I had to remove all other cards in my system (i.e. network, sound) and only have the monitor, keyboard and mouse plugged in. Only then, would the card send a signal to the monitor. Then, one by one, I added everything back in and it all worked. If it wasn't for the install problem, I'd give this 5 stars! I have used 3DMark and consistently get scores in the 1800's with this card. As well, I've played Madden 2002 and Max Payne so far and the graphics are awesome!"
1,not compatable to windows xp professional,"in order to review this upgrade, it should be compatable to xp, and bye the way it said it was and it was not. so what is the catch 22 on this upgrade to my video card. please explain to me one thing or is the information correct about not being compatable to windows xp.thanks steve jackson sr"
3,INTRO BEST SONG,"WELL TO START OFF THE INTRO WAS THE BEST TRACK AT 2 MINUTES, THE PRODUCTION WAS WAY OFFF....SOME SONGS GOT REAL QUIET, OTHERS WOULDN'T EVEN BUMP HARD, IT WAS KIND WEIRD, IT SEEMED LIKE IT WAS DONE BY AMATEURS OR IT WAS AN INTERNET DOWNLOAD OR SOMETHING, THE CD JUST DIDN'T SOUND CLEAR, BUT MAYBE IT WAS JUST THE COPY I HAD, REGARDLESS HELL RELL CAN RIP THE MIC."
3,3 Staaaaaaaasssssss,Lets Get it Str8 I aint a fan of dipset but I can listen to some of Hell Rell if you like Hell Rell then cop thisIt's alright the instrumentals iz str8The lyrics iz str8there are some colaborations
1,DID NOT RECEIVE AS ORDERED,"ITEM RECEIVED WAS NOT WHAT WAS ORDERED, RETURNED AND RECEIVED CREDIT. DUNNO WHERE THE ERROR WAS, BUT, THAT;S OK.,, DIDN' LIKE ROLLERMOUSE, AFTERALL."
1,low quality,"I suspected that the lenses are not high quality but I don't think that the quality is so low. 0.45x one has wrong vignetting. 2x one has so huge chromatic dispersion that it is absolutely useless. Additionally the glass is not high quality.Only macro does well (0.45x is assembled from a macro lens + an add. lens).Len cups are too loose and they are useless also.The price should be about $15, not more."
3,Fell short,"When I picked up this book I expected a snappy, general and interesting survey of the area of emotion that is customary of the books in this series. Instead, what emerged was the author trying to push his own view of the matter-- one inspired by evolutionary psychology. I learnt more about evolutionary psychology than emotion from my reading. Nonetheless, despite its shortcomings I do not regret buying this book as it does contain much that is interesting and the references that it provides are useful.(I would have given this book 3.5 stars if I had the option)"
3,"Good value, but has some glitches","I'm using this flash with my Canon Dig Rebel and Canon 30D, and I've found it to be a little unpredictable. There have been times where it simply will not fire with the E-TTL, but yet the ""test"" button makes it fire. Sometimes it automatically picks up the lens range, (e.g. 50mm), but sometimes it ignores it. I keep telling myself I need to read the manual again, but I'm not sure it is my error. When it works, it works great. But communication with my Canons has been hit and miss so far."
1,Need the updated version,"I bought this to take with me on a trip to Asia. The flight takes much longer than my iPod's battery would last and this seemed to be a great solution. However, when I put fresh batteries in and connected my iPod, nothing happened. I then bought new batteries just in case, only with the same result. I contacted APC and they sent me a replacement. Long story made short: it produced the same result. Thus, I contacted APC again and this time they sent me the newer model, which does not have that tiny wire extension. Instead, you plug the iPod's USB cable directly into the main unit; the unit also has an LED light which lets you know that it actually works. My advice: skip this version and go for the newer model."
4,Works,"This isn't anything special, just does what it is supposed to. Charges or powers anything with a USB charging port."
5,"All fans of contemporary percussion music, look here!","This disc contains some of the great works for solo percussion by the authorities in the field of contemporary music.The performances and recording quality are both superb! Clearly all care and effort went into the recording and text however, the dual layered dvd /cd is in PAL format, and will require said player or a media transfer to see the studio footage and interview with Xenikas. Considering we spend much time searching for the ""right music"" to add to our collection, this disc offers ample material that holds the best this rare genra has to offer."
5,Another great KOSS item,"I have used these type items for years. They are easy to put in your ear - similar to ""foamy"" ear plugs. If you don't like ear plugs, don't expect to like these. The sound isolation is superb, as is the quality. The microphone is also very good. A lot less background noise than others I have tried."
2,Not as PDA compatible as it claims,"I bought this unit to interface my Palm V's serial cradle to my new notebook that has only USB ports. Not a good choice. The unit ""features"" a MANUAL RESET BUTTON which must be pressed for 5 seconds every time the computer comes out of sleep mode to restart the ports. Its drivers are not smart enough to do this by themselves. (Forget about putting the hub out of sight to eliminate the clutter)Even with the reset button, I often had to exit and restart the Palm Hotsync manager to get it to talk to the Palm.Also, the unit requires its own power brick, adding to the clutter on the desk.Avoid this unit unless you really need all the ports"
1,Very unreliable,"Very unreliable piece of equipment. Works for awhile, but looses ports, keyboards, etc... on a regular basis. Only buy this product if you like rebooting your computer to get your keyboard, mouse, or other ports back again every few hours. Also, some vendors are pretending this is a ""docking station"" it is not. It is only a port replicator."
1,Do NOT buy this port replicator!,"NO Support from Targus.Doesn't work correctly with the ethernet connection.Can't find out if it actually supports USB 2.0- probably does not, from what I've managed to find.I did finally get the ps/2 and keyboard ports to work, which is what I really wanted/needed it for.I purchased this from an amazon reseller, and I'll try (yeah, right) to return it. What a piece of junk. Mine came used, scratched, with no original driver disc."
1,No suppport at Targus,"I tried to use this with XP - forget it! No drivers at Targus, their search did not even find the hub! Most of the connections kind of worked, but not the serial port which was what I wanted to use it for in the first place since my notebook has none and I needed to support my Palm Pilot.I at least expected a support note, but came up with zip. If this is the way they support their products I won't buy a Targus brand product again. Don't waste your time."
5,"When properly equipped, it works smoothly","This product performed well. All you have to do is to install the drivers (if it didn't come with the port replicator, find it here at the Targus site: http://www.targus.com/us/Downloads/PAEPR090_v3_1.exe). Everything is converted to USB: your LAN connection, your audio, etc. Makes setting up and tearing down fast and easy."
1,Horrible little creature!,"For low usage and low port requirements this *may* do the job for you. My experience with this product has been a terrible waste of time. LAN port drops connection on a regular basis. Had to replace the unit 4 times, 3 for the LAN problem and the 1st one for a K/B and Mouse drop off. Having to reset this device on a regular basis is a nasty little solution. I am looking elsewhere for a reliable product personally. PS have also tried the new *updated* version of this port replicator the PA095U and has the same problems with a slightly different logo on the front to stare at while ripping your hair out!"
1,It's a piece of s***. Don't buy it.,"In order to use an external PS/2 keyboard and mouse using this thing, I have to: 1) unplug the Targus from the laptop; 2) disconnect the mouse and keyboard from the Targus; 3) boot the laptop; 4) wait for the login screen; 5) plug in the Targus and wait for it to come up; 6) plug in the mouse and keyboard; 7) THEN I can sit down and log in.Disgusting. Anything is better than this."
3,"Good Service, Product was larger than anticipated","Unit is a little larger than it appeared in the picture. It seems to work well, with the exception of the Ethernet port, which will not work with my Windows 7 operating system."
2,It's a lot of money for something that failed in less than 2 years,Bought it less than two years ago with my Dell Laptop and it's failed already. Looks like it doesn't have enough parts to make it break so quickly. More than frustrating. I've been had! But do I have a choice if I want to have a printer and a mouse and a keyboard and a scanner and a Cardscan and a separate disk drive and a Palm?
1,Money Better spent elsewhere,Tried using with an XP SP2 laptop. The device could not maintain a connection to attached peripherals. Purchased specifically for the parallel port function which would fail during transmit. LOOK FOR ANOTHER OPTION
2,not original,when i got the cds i was very happy..it came fast and then i played it not relizing that the original songs where not there but a band singing all of them...i dj on the side and was hoping to add to my collection but no. did not like at all.........
4,Song Review,"I liked the compilation and the type of songs chosen. I would have liked that the description included that the songs are done by cover bands. Yes, they are very well done but they are still covers.I recommend it for the price, 33 songs as a good bargain, good fun to listen to but do not expect to hear the original bands. I'm listening to it now and enjoying it."
3,I enjoyed it at times,iam not sure where they were coming from with this one...custard have changed a lot...i used to hate them a lot till tiny boys and tiny beancurd franks what a weird deliema of comfort culture do you say extravaganto deluxe empeach myself some more get down doggies oi oi oi ra ra ra oooxxazzzazz...!
2,stopped working,"I haven't had this product for a year yet, and it has stopped working already. previous phone chargers with differnt companies always worked until the phone was retired."
3,"Nice charger, but has its problems.","It charges my phone and allows me to listen to music in my car at the same time, which is great, the problem is that there is some noise that is added to my music due to the charger. To make matters worse as the car goes faster, pitch and volume of the hum gets higher. Its bearable in the city, but quite loud on the highway."
3,You Can Do Better,This is a cute little hamper. But a couple of words of caution: it fabric shrunk after I washed it so it no longer fits and it is beginning to pull apart. There are better values out there.
2,"Not the best, but gets the job done.",My husband and I bought this for our baby girls room since it matched her decor and we needed a hamper. When we got it we noticed that we had to re-sew on the velcro that holds the washable cloth on the frame. The cloth is too small for the frame and it easily folds back together.
2,not sturdy,"We have had another hamper like this for 6 years (different brand?) and it has held up beautifully but this one broke within the first few weeks - the wooden rods in the frame are cheap and break easily. We still use it and it's cute, but if you want a sturdy hamper, don't choose this one."
2,Lost all my Christmas photos!,"I used this memory card for my digital camera, and lost ALL the photos of my little baby's first Christmas!I'd used it for a couple of months with no problem, downloading pics to my computer time and time again. Then Christmas morning I go to turn on the camera, and WHAM! All pics lost! The card is now useless in all devices.I'm trying another brand. Please do not make the same mistake I did."
1,Especially becareful of the ones from China,"Like some of the reviewers here I replaced the original card but still had the same problem of 'corrupted data' after taking about 40 pictures with my canon digital camera. The pictures either got lost or distorted after this happnened and I could no longer take any more pictures.This ruined my very expensive vacation in Italy where I lost 40-50 pictures taken there and could no longer shoot any!Both cards had ""China"" on the back and I heard from somewhere to esecially look out for Sandisk made in China.I strongly suggest that you stay away from Sandisk if you don't want to lose data or expensive pictures like me."
1,Not recommended for Palm Devices,"As noted on several websites (with which I have no affiliation), SanDisk SD/MMC cards work slower than SimpleTech or Lexar when plugged into Palm Devices. This is especially true of writes on my Palm Tunsten T.Note that if you remove a SanDisk from a Palm and modify its contents thru an external SD ""reader"", you will see read/write performance that is similar to its competition.The problem appears to be unique to Palm devices, if you aren't using this for a Palm device, I am not aware of a reason to avoid this product."
1,Works great when it works... now it doesn't,"Worked great for a couple months, pulled it out one day and it corrupted all of the data on the disk. All the JPGs and MP3s were garbled and unusable. Now that seems to happen at least once every couple days.It worked fine for a month, and i've read many reports of other users now who have had corrpution problems with the Sd disks. In it's current condition for me, it's unusable."
3,It works but...,It is too slow to be of any use for what the newest digital cameras are capable of. It cannot record 30fps video for more than about 15 to 20 seconds and cannot keep up with burst mode on faster cameras.
1,angry,"May be I'm just unlucky to get a lemon from a reputable manufacturer of SD card. Things (#$^&*) like this happen, but I'm still a bit angry. Data got wiped out for no reasons several times during a few months' span. Word documents can simply turn into a page of Y's and become unreadable. Then one day it just died, uttering an error message with its last breath..."
1,Useless card for Dell Axim PDA,I bought a new card and it failed in just a couple of days. From literature review it appears that this card has known issues with Axim PDA's and other devices. I contacted San Disk customer service and I am yet to hear from them. Stay away from this junk.
2,Incompatable with HP 315 camera and WIN XP,The OS will detect only 20MB of the volume size IF you are using this card for an HP camera and WIN 2000/XP.The work around is not pretty. Buy a card scanner. The following URL has all the info:http://h20015.www2.hp.com/en/document.jhtml?reg=&plc;=&lc;=en&cc;=us&prodId;=hpphotosma22062&docName;=bpy60116&cat;=solve
4,mine works great,I just happen to notice the poor rateings on this card since I've had no problems with mine thought I'd add my 2cents Mine says Tiawan on the back. the only thing I don't like is the lock card devise moves to easily and i have to be carefull installing it my camera so's not to accidently lock it
1,Doo Rag,This product may be good for a very young child but not for a grown man. The doo rag was way to small. The only good thing about it was the color. Very poor quality product.It does not deserve any stars at all.
1,Poorly Illustrated outdated text,"The photo's in this book are about 40 years old that were poor to begin with and don't offer much if anything today as much of a beginner text. There are far too many up to date, well illustrated and well documented carving texts and DVD's out there. Pass it by."
5,I feel better already!,"I am an active 59yr old woman who was starting to notice I was tiring easily and becoming non-energenic. This was a new feeling for me, and I didn't like it. I bought this Source of Life Energy Shake and have had it every morning for two weeks. I feel better already! I am less tired and regaining my energy. I have my shake at around 8:00 a.m., and do not feel hungry until around 12:30p.m. I feel it also keeps blood sugar levels even-no highs and lows. I mix it with 8 oz. of non-fat milk, 2 scoops energy powder,and 2 ice cubes, in the blender. I really like the taste made this way. I tried in water and juice and could not drink it. I look forward to it every morning!"
3,okay,"I was sooo excited to get this in the mail and was sooo disappointed when i tried it. The taste was really strong and it was hard to enjoy it... I have to also say that I have eaten spinach and kale smoothies so I wasnt looking for a milk shake when I purchased it... But it may just be me becuase everyone else lovesss the taste... I mixed it at first with almond milk, then water, then green tea... then i tried orange juice and it was much better... cant say i would order this again because of the taste and 8 oz of orange juice is about 130 calories and i dont like drinking my calories but i would like to try the berry flavor... what I will say is give it a try because it is really healthy for you!!"
4,Source of Life Health Shake,"Hi I tried this product the taste was NOT TOO GOOD. But all the healthy stuff they crammed into such a little amount you have to drink is wonderful. Also on a positive note, my HAIR, after only a few days of drinking it, became INCREDIBLY soft!!! It was amazing. Good product, will buy again. WIsh they would come out with some new flavors though!Sam"
5,This Stuff Is REALLY Great!,"Rarely have I run across a product that really lives up to its name, but 'Source of Life Energy Shake' does just that. It's a comprehensive combination of nutrients that assist in not only giving the user a boost of energy, but also supplies many of the needed nutrients not found in the daily diet of most people. I highly recommend this product."
5,Delicious!,I have been drinking these shakes for years and I still crave them! I mix mine with cold rice milk and frozen bananas...amazing!!!
4,The taste is not that bad...,"It would not taste good if you mix it just with water. I mix it with diluted apple or peach juice and it tastes O.K. The powder is loaded with lots of healthy supplements and I noticed it has a lot of B vitamines. I do not take it every day; I did not see noticable increase in energy. However, it makes it a light breakfast that still gives you good nutrients and protein."
1,Bad deal,I ordered a two pound package of theses for my dogIt seamed like a good deal. I didn't receive a two pounder instead I paidWay too much for the one pounder I got.RIPPED OFF
3,Good all around book on Wild Mushrooms,After a long intro there is lots of information on how mushrooms are cultivated. The bulk of this book is information about and pics of various wild mushrooms. As a field guide its semi-usable but I'm sure there are books out there that are better suited for that job. Granted I am a sub-novice at this stuff but I was only able to identify with 75% certainty three different types of mushrooms that I ran across in soccer fields and parks close to my home. The best thing in this book for me though was the beautiful photographs of various mushrooms in their natural habitat.
2,"Good, cheap all in 1 PC",I want to buy one of this all in 1 PC after i saw the advert from PC world. Then i found out this Puro all in 1 PC is cheaper than the one from PC World. So i bought one and like the design and the quality of this machine. I thinking to buy another one for my girl friend for the christmas.
5,Potential for more.,"Spencer Cook, the main character in this book, seems typical of any human searching for truth and meaning in life. He makes subtle but significant changes that allow him to be more fulfilled and satisfied with his life. I personally loved seeing the change that came about from true life experiences. There is potential for more of everything out in the world. The author allows the reader to feel like change and satisfaction is out there for everyone. In this engaging and simple story there is so much to find out about oneself."
3,Good story - some glitches,"First of all, this is the kind of work that is necessary today - a book that encourages people to live with courage and with love. I loved that the main character took some significant risks, listened to his inner knowing and blessed his and other lives as a result. Somehow I don't get the relationship between Spence and Annetta. It's not that I don't think it could happen, but the author didn't develop that relationship enough. Also, I assume this is a self-published work based on the number of printing errors. Overall I think it's a decent book. It's certainly better than most Mormon fiction I've read, but that's not saying a lot."
4,"An excellent story filled with love, life and philosophy.","This book was wonderful and refreshing to read. Unlike the majority of Mormon Fiction, this story is believable. The charaters are well developed and realistic. The story is written so that it entertains and teaches at the same time. I love the philosophical questions that the main charater Specher has. They are questions that any young person asks and attempts to find answers to. This book is perfect for those lazy Thursdays when you are in a thinking mood and need something to indentify with."
2,Thoroughly Uncertain,"I bought this toothpaste because my cat has gingivitis. Although I do not brush her teeth daily, I was expecting to see some sort of improvement, which has not been evident. This may just be my lack of consistency using the toothpaste. HOWEVER, a clear effect of the toothpaste is that it makes my cat's breath WORSE for days after brushing (which is impressive considering she already has a bad case of gingivitis). I've been trying to continue to use the toothpaste despite the breath issue, but it doesn't seem to be helping."
5,best book on 9 star ki for the lay person,"Sandifer covers a lot of ground in this book and uses easy to use language and charts. It's hard to put down once you start. Also, I had a question so I e-mailed him about it and he responded to me in less than a day. This is Japanese astrology, not Chinese, so people should know that if they're thinking it's Chinese, it will be a little different. My main reason for getting into 9 star was through feng shui, and although there are many other types of astrology used, this seems to be the easiest, yet applicable for Westerners who are used to getting answers quickly and easily. As long as you know someone's birthdate, you can figure out their chart, no need for exact hour or minute of birth. Well worth the price!"
2,"Slightly amusing, not very useful","A funny book to read, but not something you can really use. The phrases are accurate for the most part, but in order to be able to use these phrases correctly, you need an understanding of the situations in which they are applicable. Something that comes with days and weeks of listening, not reading a 100+ page book."
1,Mistake on back cover,A 1st semester Italian student would know that ho mangeato is incorrect. It should be ho mangiato. I'm not sure that I can trust this book with such an obvious error.
1,Duplicates questions,"Certainly this is a fine book. However over 50% of the questions are also in the excellent publication ""PMP Exam Prep: A course in a book."" If you already have the, ""PMP Exam Prep: A course in a book"", I would recommend purchasing a different book than this Pocket Guide. I liked Kim Heldman's ""PMP Project Management Professional."""
1,Rita is in the ethical grey zone...,"Rita's new books has only ** 1 ** question that was NOT in her other book (PMP Exam Prep)!I enjoyed her PMP Exam Prep study guide and I was looking forward to additional practice on the situational topics. I figured that even if 50% of the questions were repeats (as one reviewer noted), then I would still get value. Unfortunately, there was NO new material. Worse, for explanations, she tells you to look at her other book.As a PMP who signed off on the code of ethics, I am not sure that she should be engaging in this behavior...Shame, Shame, Shame..."
1,"Almost all questions are from ""PMP Exam Prep (4th Edition)""","Deeply disappointed. Most of the questions are from Rita's another book ""PMP Exam Prep (4th Edition)"". Buying ""PMP Exam Prep (4th Edition)"" is enough. Don't waste your money on this one."
5,Real insight to situational questions,"This is a handy pocket guide, contains situational questions covering all PMI process areas, with answers explained for clear understanding. This really helped in properly approcahing the PMP exam questions."
5,The only training book you need!,I bought several dog training books when I got my new puppy. None come even close to comparing to this one!! Definitely the best dog training book you can buy! Don't waste your money on any of the other ones. All the same info is in this one with so much more! Great perspective on how to train your puppy and how to have a real friend for life!!!
1,"Harsh, outdated methods","This book was first published more than 30 years ago, but unfortunately, the training methods it describes are still used by some owners and obedience instructors. All of the obedience exercises in the book are taught by jerking the dog around on a choke collar (even before the dog understands what he is supposed to do), and the author even advocates striking dogs (for housetraining accidents and obedience mistakes, among other things). Our understanding of dog behavior has evolved a great deal since the 1970's, and fortunately, the methods now used by reputable trainers and behaviorists are much more humane (as well as more effective). I would recommend a book by Ian Dunbar, Jean Donaldson, or Karen Pryor--these authors discuss up-to-date, science-based techniques for teaching dogs to behave politely, with no jerking, yelling or hitting required."
4,"Blooming Hydrangeas, mate!","These hydrangeas are even larger than I hoped - the arrangement must be 1-1/2 feet tall! Very nice floral accent; however the 'blue' is almost purple. More lifelike than expected, for the price paid."
5,Enjoyable commentary,"Pastoral commentary, with strong balance of textual insights, helpful illustrations, thoughtful application. Alongside of John's Stott's Bible Speaks Today series, a must have for pastors and students of the New Testament."
2,"Great bag for the price, but lasted only 9 months.","I got this for $9.95 so I have no complaints.It's holds tons of stuff, have lots of organizing pockets and compartments, and doesn't look cheap at all.Unfortunately, the seam between the fabric and the synthetic leather part of the top handle came apart, and I ended up tossing it in the garbage after less than 9 months."
4,Decent guide for visitors to major Texas forts,"This magazine-like book describes about three dozen forts ""that held a key role in the Indian campaigns."" Thus, only major forts are included (The Alamo, Forts Brown, Bliss, McIntosh, Duncan, Belknap, Stockton, Davis, to name just a few). When and where each fort was established, a brief historical account, and the state of the fort today are given in varying degrees of thoroughness. The last chapter is barely a listing of various less important forts. Many of these forts are today state or county parks and offer something of interest for the visitor to see. A handy guide for travelers visiting these sites."
3,Cotton is scratchy and they shrink too much,"Watch out for how much they shrink. I cannot tuck them in now, but since I have washed them I can also not return them. Almost makes the cheap nature of the cotton irrelevant."
4,better,"My hubby hates a large, loose neck opening in his tee shirts . . . we've tried 'em all, name brands, store brands, designer names, every kind we can find. For now, the Jockey's are the best for his preference. Not overly fitted and not super thick or super thin fabric. Life span on these is average I'd say. Have to replace them fairly often."
3,Not what i was expecting,I'm really disapointed by this book. Was expecting a lot more after reading all those good reviews... This is only a step by step tutorials book. The author doesnt explain that much anything related to cinema 4D... I don't understand exactly what I am doing. The book is starting with those tutorials without at least explaining the basic of this software and the interface... I need first to understand the interface before being able to do anything else with this software and this is not the book that will help me out for sure... It's not by telling me to put a value somewhere in the attributes that I will actually understand WHY to put this value there...:(
1,"Seattle, WA","Illustrations for the iPad Kindle edition are in black and white, even though the format supports color, which is sort of a huge issue for a book about graphics and visual imagery."
5,My Former Professor Does 3D Justice...,"Anne is my former professor and I was excited to get the book. I've only dabbled in 3D in the past, but this may make me give it a real effort! The Artist's Project Sourcebook looks to be something even I can follow along with. Seriously, a very well-written, fun, artsy approach to something thats always presented as stiff, technical, and mathematical. It's not full of 3D work that looks like 3D work. It's full of tasty pieces of artwork that look like they came from a gallery. It's like stepping inside a carnival and being greeted by all the wacky characters. I cant wait to sit down and try the exercises!"
4,Lotsa stuff to explore,"This book offers an extensive exploration of the Cinema 4D R10 Three-D illustration program. It is a good compliment to the documentation that comes with the program and other tutorial information found on the web or elsewhere in print. Specifically covers version 10 but applicable to later versions as well. One caveat to MAC users... the DVD may not (in my case DID NOT) run on the MAC OS. This can be resolved by contacting the publisher and obtaining a MAC compatible replacement which DID run. Lesson files on the DVD are integral to the book... you really can't read it without them. Lotsa other stuff to explore as well... so having a working DVD is important. Overall... a good introduction for the beginner at Cinema 4D or for an intermediate user wanting to extend/refine their skills. For both, a good way to get to that all important 'learn by experiment' stage."
2,not for me...,"This book is beginners, really??? it does nothing for me. Most of the assignments I did in class, I had no clue of what I was doing. The steps inside the book were confusing at times. I agree with the other reviewers that the book doesn't tell you what they are and its function, it only tells you to do ""this and that"". I want to sell this book back. I wouldn't recommend this book for beginners AT ALL! It's more for intermediate/advanced. I wonder there is book out there called ""Cinema 4d for Dummies""..."
3,Honest Start,In a very special personalized style the author puts together a lot of fundamentals for the starter in C4D. I'ts a nice honest book covering much of the core of C4D considering modeling and texturing. I'ts more art oriented than tech oriented but still a very usefull fire up to understand the Maxon C4D metaphor.
3,Madness for a beginner,"Cinema 4D can be an extremely complex software with an even more complex user interface. The exercises in this book can be maddening. While the author goes into alot of detail describing what to do, she does not do a good job explaining whats being done. Sometimes instructions spins you around in circles. For example: ""drag a tag for selection into the box for selection"" is not English when you are trying navigate around an interface with several tags, selections, and numerous boxes. What the heck is she saying?Overall the book has some great tutorials and gets one up to speed rather quickly on the very basics of C4D but there remains to be ALOT of work on finetuning the details and contents of each exercise. The author needs to really comb thru every exercise to make sure it is understandable to a beginner. The software alone is intimidating enough.The DVD has a wealth of material and tutorials so I'm giving the review a 3 star."
3,"Good, but not great","I have extensive knowledge in 2-D animation using Adobe After Effects, but I wanted to get a little more info on modeling and using 3-D animation. The book consists of several exercises that you can work along with. Most of the ""tutorials"" are strictly, ""do this, then do that"", without much explanation as to ""why"" you're doing this. I would have liked more explanation of what certain modifiers, tags, options, etc did so that I could better identify situations in the future when it might be useful. Instead, you really end up just going for the ride. For someone with animation experience you can gain some good insight into 3-D animation and this book is a decent starting off point. I would hardly consider it a one-stop source, but it was good enough to get me started."
3,This would have been good if my companion disc worked,I learned alot form this book despite having to fake my way through the tutorials. Bad disc and I couldn't get a replacement. I never got a response back from Amazon or the publisher. Not the most exciting of 3D creations but they do get the job done.
4,A wonderful insite into the world of psychiatrist,"Even though this was written 20 some years ago, the book is still very acurate about what goes on in state assylums and clinics today. Dr. Viscott is a wonderful story teller. His honesty about his struggles and humorous incounters with patients are through out this book making it an enjoyable read. It is a great book for any person who is interested in psychiatry or psychology, for it is easy to read and understand."
3,what song,"does anyone know the name of the song playin in the gangsters car....uno, when all the boys are chillin on the step and it creeps up..you cant hear any words, it just has a really nice beat..thanks"
4,Missing Tunes,"The Fivesteps 'Ooo child' is superb!, shame its not on here, whats the name of the electro track thats playing when groups as kids go on a trek through the hood to see the dead body, that 'electro monster' playing when the guys are playing basketball.......... all these tunes should have been on here,the album really misses some gems from the film, its the movement from 70's,80's 90's thats the great aspect of the film"
4,the song in the car ride to the seaside,the song in the car with fishburne taking his son fishing is called 'ohh child' by the 'five stairsteps' !!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Black on Black,"I can't believe so few people have reviewed this tape because when it came out it seemed like everyone had this. In the high school marching band and pep band we played ""Black on Black"", as we called it at football games. You could hear the drums and horns and sax rising through the air five blocks away. No one wanted to hear the alma mater, only Black on Black. Nothing was more powerful then that beat. Most of us didn't even know who wrote it. I used to lend this album out (i had it on cassette tape) out to people and they would come back and tell me how they just played Black on Black over and over with the bass turned all the way up. This was one of the first tapes we bought. We were the same age as Tevin Cambell and Just Ask Me To was a radio hit."
3,The song that I really want to know,What's the song that is playing when Dough boys mum is telling him as a kid that he'll never amount to anything in life? It's the same scene where she meets Tre on her doorstep for the first time
1,Disappointment,"This boook had been recommended to me by a professional photographer from whom I was taking a creative photography class. Obvioiusly, I was eagerly anticipating its arrival. Imagine my surprise when I opened the package and found that almost half of the book, including the cover, was missing. I immediately returned the book, hoping to exchange it for an in tact version, and was told that I could not do that. I forget the reason but it was disappointing.The question I have is, ""How could anyone send out half a book?""Thomas C. Carrier"
5,Great book,"Very good book to add on to Mia`s life.. she really learned a lot in this volume, can't wait to get the next!"
5,iady from germany,this book is just one of the greatest books i have ever read. most of them being from this series. all i can tell you is if in your life you want to read all types of books all you have to read is this series because it has it all.
3,Better off with the paperback version...,"I've had my fair share of teen books. I try to keep a balance between my books. Some are intense, some are depressing, some are just mindless fluff, some are controversial, etc. etc.This book definitely belongs to the mindless fluff category. The plot was subpar and the ending was even worse. It was unsatisfactory and hurried. However, as far as the comic relief and the occasional laugh-out-loud moments, Cabot succeeeds.Plus, many of the pages were just...fillers. The Carl Jung letters, Mia's notes from her economy class, even the notes between her and Tina (even though these are the only times we actually get to ""interact"" with Tina...since she is rarely seen in actual conversation). Plus the lists...I have always enjoyed Lilly's/Mia's lists, with the exception of the ones in this particular book.Please. ""Women who are too beautiful to live?"" And Paris Hilton CAN discuss foreign affairs?That is crossing the line."
4,great colors,"A bit expensive, but it has really brightened the room. Our six-year old loves it. I like the fact that it is cotton on the outside."
2,"Adorable, but doesn't hold up well",We bought the sheets (not the comforter) and after only 2 washes they are fraying and the seams are coming apart. The design is really cute and my toddler loves it.
2,Counter tenor is bad otherwise OK,"it's just that the vibrato of the counter tenor drives me nuts but if you don't mind vibrato you will like it. Nothing terribly interesting in terms of performance but there is no Schwanengesang CDs available as long as I know, you have no choice."
5,"It's Good, It's Strong",Covers litter box area well if you need to spay something. I don't always use a spray because we clean the boxes very often during the day and have no odor but this is good for those necessary times. Good product. Been around a long time. Have seen vets use it in liquid form on floors.
4,Handy file system,"I like the portability of this file cart. My husband and I share a small office space so whenever one of us needs to get into files, we are usually in the other's way. With the Fold'nRoll, I can move the cart to wherever I want. At the end of the year, I plan to put the lid on the bin, label it and put it in storage, replacing with another Rubbermaid bin for next year's files."
2,Fender Mini Master Tone Amp,"There is no product description giving an actual size. This amp is 6 1/2 wide by 6 1/4 high by 2 1/4 deep. It looks like a toy. There is no power source. It requires 9V batteries or 9V DC input jack (not included).Over all, I'm not impressed."
1,Very small,"This item is very, very small... about the size of a small dictionary. It has no power source, apparently requiring batteries. It's grey, not pink as in the photo. This is something I'd expect to find in the toy section at a ""dollar store"".Overall, I wasted my money and will have to buy a different amp for my daughter."
1,Good Enough,"Pictures of animals in various zoos. The images are good enough, the best come across as well thought-out portraits of animals in captivity. The weaker images come across like tourist shots at a zoo. Perhaps this is laziness on the photographer's part or simply a weak eye for editing."
3,D-shot presents some w/c anthems,"With hot songs from C-Bo,Seattle's D.M.S.,Mac Mall,Prodigy and Havok(South Central Cartel)and D-Shot feat.Spice-1 this is a solid rap compilation considering the fact that theres to many rap comps out there that r put together that dont cut it.This isn't Above the rim but its far from Vanilla Ices and Will Smiths greatest hits...."
2,What are you all talking about?,"I'll give this 2 stars just for the beats.As far as being ""cutting edge"" and ""radically new"" and whatever other great sounding description these reviewers want to leave, this album is not.Elementary school kids could make an album more intelligible than this. If you want to listen to this CD, you're DEFINITELY gonna need to be on something. I can't imagine how one could stand it otherwise."
4,Enjoyable Textbook,It was a great textbook for learning about the universe. I grabbed a binder for a few bucks and it became a nice bound textbook. I prefer spiral binding anyways because you don't have to crease the pages.
4,Last Mimzy review,"Children's movie that adults can enjoy. It is entertaining without violence or sexual inuendo. Interesting premise is based on time travel as in ""terminator"" but with a different purpose. Nicely done."
4,Pretty Worthy Movie,"I will confess, the only reason I heard of this movie was because of a Roger Waters single that I downloaded and after hearing the song so many times, I decided to buy the movie. I will have to say that I wasn't disappointed by the movie. It's not a perfect movie, but it's not bad either.I like that the movie had a message for us and didn't club us on the head about it. I also like how they dealt with Homeland Security in this movie. The special effects were pretty good and the acting was okay.This was a pretty good family type movie and I would definately watch it again."
4,It was really good!,"Movie was a kid friendly scifi. If you're looking for a marriage of some ancient earth lore and futuristic scifi in a simple friendly and creative way, check out this movie."
5,One of the best movies I have ever seen,"Fast paced, Mind blowing Great thinking movie...You have to give credit to a film such as Mimzy that, unlike most quick ha-ha, make-a-buck stuff for kids, could actually get them thinking about making a difference in a world in desperate need of change.It is about: Two kids find a bizarre box on the beach and are soon exhibiting signs of off-the-chart genius in this gently mind-blowing fantasy film. Little Emma (Rhiannon Leigh Wryn) finds a cute bunny doll in the box, who talks to her in electronic code,"
2,"Flawed, but watchable.","Two children find a box of strange objects on the beach, and discover they must save the future.The fantasy element special effects are, by far, the best thing about the movie. Most of the actors, however, were unlikable and detracted from the story. The adults, in particular, were helpless weenies, beyond even what would be expected in a children's movie.The hippy, love Gaia, hate the Patriot Act preaching was unnecessarily intrusive, as well. Can't Hollywood make a kid's movie without politics? Seven year olds can't vote, so leave them alone."
1,"Looked great, but another company BLUNDER ruins the day.","Are movie studios really this stupid? How do you release a movie in this day and age of accessability without at LEAST putting English closed captioning on the disc? I was so excited to pop this in the DVD player and was just settling in to watch it when to my shock, there is no option for english subtitles. I am nearly deaf and have been for almost my entire life so DVD has been a godsend for me because of my impairment. My television is an HDTV monitor that doesn't have a closed caption decoder built in, so I rely on the discs to have subtitles available from the set up menu, but alas New Line blundered another crappy ""Infinifilm"" release. Now I'm stuck with returning this movie and being frustrated that I can't share in it with my friends. Thanks again New Line for kicking impaired people in the teeth."
4,great family film,"My whole family enjoys this movie. A little science fiction, a little new aginess but great effects and heartwarming relationships between siblings and parents. 4.5 stars!"
3,Good Family Film,"When two kids find a box of futuristic toys, they hide them from their parents instinctively but don't or can't hide the changes that come over them as their brains expand. What are these futuristic toys and will the kids ever figure out their purpose? Viewers know it's to save the world of the future and hints of the trauma to come are given in the science teacher's talk about DNA but beyond that we aren't told much -- which is probably as it should be for a children's movie.My granddaughter didn't quite understand everything that happened but it was something we could watch together. She asked a lot of questions. I thought it was wonderful for her that the film was not too suspenseful and didn't have vulgar language or overly scary scenes, but it made it a 3 stars for an adult since it was a little tepid. The children act natural during the first half but not the second. My granddaughter hasn't asked to watch it again, which is telling."
4,The Last Mimzy,"I enjoyed the movie. It was visually beautiful, and exciting, a great movie for tweens or older. But it was kind of scary for smaller children."
4,Great story--I hope children will love it and will understand it years later when they see it again,"Two children visiting their cottage on Whidby Island find a box full of toys, including a stuffed rabbit. Soon, their abilities expand. Noah, the eldest, was barely passing Science now he's submitted a Science Fair project that could win National. And, Emma is talking to her stuffed bunny and it's telling her about a very bleak time for a future race and asking her to help.The story's great, the casting and effects are enthralling. I think ""Mimzy"" is destined to be a children's classic. While the young ones won't really understand what the story means right now, I think it's one they will watch again and again--and a valuable lesson will sink in."
3,A tale of two reviews,"This movie would more accurately be described as ""inspired by"" Mimsy Were the Borogoves, than ""based on"" (as used in the Amazon review). Therefore, I think there are two audiences for this and will address them seperately.First audience are those of us who read and loved the Padgett work, and were hoping for a big screen version. If that describes you this is a zero star movie. It is not in the least faithful to the original, and skews toward childish cutsieness whenever possible. There is nothing plausible in any of the adults behavior, and the actors look like they're just going through the motions.The second audience would be families looking for escapist fun. If that's you this is a family-friendly, harmless little movie, that's pretty to look at, with content appropriate for the 8-12 crowd (younger will be confused, older will be bored)."
2,Mimzy could have been better,good movie start but disappointing quality storyline as it continued. Wish they made it a better. Good premise but failed in the end.
1,Dry as the Sahara,"With all due respect to the producer and the actors, but the storyline to this movie will put you to sleep. The trailers made it out to be far more interesting than it was (as usual). The story could have been brought up a notch or two. If you're looking for a movie to put the kids to sleep by, this is it!The cinematograhy was sharp and pleasantly set in the Pacific northwest, the scenes however would often shoot off to vague moments, with little or no guidance as to what we're suppossed to be looking at.Still, the movie might be good for smaller children."
1,Last Mimzy,The DVD does NOT work. I was so disappointed when I wanted to share it with some friends and they came over for the movie and it wouldn't run.
3,"Ok for a rental night, wouldn't want to own it","The previews of this moving looked so magical and mystical. The scenery and special effects looked spectacular. And they were. And that is where the ohh ahhhh left. The characters felt dry, other then the main character (the adorable little girl - who was more convincing then the rest of the cast) and the stuffed bunny that made these little cooing sounds was the best supporting actor for this flick.This movie had a ton of potential but fell short of delivering.It is another worth watching .. once."
3,A little light,"This was not a bad movie, but the short story it was based on was much darker, and probably, therefore more interesting. In the Kuttner/Moore story, the fate of the children (who actually entered another dimension), was left as an unknown. Certainly, their parents could not follow them in any rescue. So to make this a children's movie, the studio made up a happy earth friendly version. I'd really have enjoyed the more adult version."
5,family entertainment,fun for the whole family. movie was in excellent condition. Even my husband enjoyed it when he expected not to.
3,I wanted to like it,"In fact, I did like it, while I was watching it. Cute little kids, evil Patriot Act guys, cute stuffed bunny - who could dislike any of that?But when the lights came up in the theater, my suspended disbelief came crashing down. Oh, I could go along with all the science fiction premises easily enough. That's the ""What If?"" part of the story, and well done. Mystical powers granted to children by carefully disguised tokens from the future - that works for me. But after ""What If?"" comes ""And Then,"" and that's where it kind of fell apart. I'm not going to given any spoilers, but the big dramatic tension in the end wasn't really resolved, it was just abandoned.So, it's a fair way to spend an evening. But that's all.//wiredweird"
2,Slow and unsatisfying,"Just didn't quite hit on all cylinders. Everything was obvious, the children weren't good enough to hold the movie together, the parents and supporting adults were flat. Nice effects and nice intent, tho. Not horrible, but there is better out there to watch."
4,Not a bad flick,"I would have normally given this three stars, but since this movie was based off a short story written in the 1940s, then I'll give it one extra star. We've seen movies and shows for decades concerning people with special gifts and talents, and the Last Mimsy is no different. There is nothing necessarily surprising about the genre and the kids being the heros of the story. Rainn Wilson from ""The Office"" delivers a great performance as well, but it is an overall decent family film with great special effects and still enjoyable."
1,What?,"This movie is extremely obnoxious and a very poor imitation of ET. Noah seemed to be modeled after Eliot, and Emma, Gertie. Was the bunny rabbit supposed to be ET? It also had smatterings of What Dreams May Come and What the Bleep Do We Know, but it fell flat. I love sci-fi and fantasy movies, and this one should've been up my alley. Instead, I enjoyed the full-length feature film on the backs of my eyelids through a nearly 2 hour slumberfest courtesy of said movie. The kids did a good job with the pitiful script they were given, as far as I could tell from only watching the first half hour and last five minutes. The special effects were superb. However, plot is what drives a movie, not special effects. I wish the writers had spent more time working the plot instead of glitzing up the special effects. If I could give it 0 stars, I would. Don't waste your money renting it. Instead, get it from your local library or wait until it comes on broadcast TV."
4,Easy introduction to market economics,"I read this when I was maybe 13 in the 1970s and it really influenced my understandings of the benefits of free market economics vs planned economies. The plot is a bit stilted, and ideologically it is clearly on the side of less regulation vs more, but in terms of understanding how communism inevitably leads to totalitarianism and on concepts like the ""invisible hand"" it was very influential for me."
4,A sneaky way to teach economics,"This is essentially an economics textbook disguised as a novel. The plot itself is interesting, reading sort of like a sequel to 1984. It has a love story, an assassination attempt and a few action scenes. And in the middle of all that, it gives a great lesson on how a market economy works and its advantages over Socialism/Communism. Those parts can get dry, but still very readable. Highly recommended for high schoolers, college students or anyone looking to learn while being entertained at the same time."
1,Inevitable tyranny,I came away with the conclusion all free societies will eventually succumb to the envy of the under achievers and lust for power by the elitists. Tyranny is simply the unavoidable final stage of every democracy and republic.Com
5,Good buy,"The first feature that impresses is the light weight. I wasn't even sure there was a TV in the box. It was easily installed and has great sound quality with a reasonably good picture. What surprised me was the remote - which looks like the inexpensive all-purpose variety - except this one is very user friendly and sensitive - you clutch it with even a little pressure and a feature pops up on the screen. All things considered, I do recommend this product."
5,love it...,"i was at the store and compared this next to a sony bravia and the picture on this was so much better...i bought it and i love it...i've never had a wide screen tv, so its going to take some adjusting to...the tv is so light...i thought i would have trouble unboxing it, but it slid right out...i plugged it in and was watching the colbert report in two minutes...i highly highly highly recommend this..."
3,You get what you pay for!,"There is no way this item is the regular price of $1100, no way.I really didn't appreciate the difference # of pixels makes until I got this unit.BIG DIFFERENCE!!VPicture quality is not very good at all. Takes alot of tweeking to get ithalf way decent. Sometimes there are actual blur spots in the image. Takesa while to 'warm up' and become clear. Also, the screws for the stand will notfit in the back of the unit for wall mounting. They are only good for the standitself.I guess for the money, at less than $400, you can't expect much. Kind of dissappointed overall."
1,BUMMED OUT..WAS A CHRISTMAS PRESENT AND DOES NOT WORK!!,"OK, so let me start by saying based on price and other reviews I read about this tv here, I chose this as the ""big"" present for my 30 yr. old daughter for Christmas. She was very excited, went to set it up, and discovered the dvd player does not work. Amazon gave her choices, either go get it fixed locally or send it back. We chose the latter due to closest place to fix it was over 1.5 hrs away from her. Needless to say, I am really bummed out she is now without her present from me and will be a while till we pick out another one. (she lives 10 hrs away from me). We are still waiting for confirmation that amazon got tv back in the mail. My suggestion to all of you...do not buy this tv. Maybe, the 30 day warrantee should have sent up red flags."
4,Shocks,"Shocks feel softer than originals that I replaced. Originals were worn some, but the new ones gave a softer ride. Didn't feel as firm."
4,Compilation of Ascetical Works on the Holy Eucharist,"The following is information from the publisher of this book. ""This is volume 6 of 22 volumes of the complete ascetical works of Saint Alphonsus de Liguori. Each volume is complete in itself and any volume can be sold separately. This volume contains various writings by Saint Alphonsus de Liguori pertaining to the Holy Eucharist. The writings have been translated from Italian to English. This volume was edited by Rev. Eugene Grimm."""
3,Nice but not really educational,"This is a nice story of how the couple reared their dogs and how they live on a day to day basis. There is some good information regarding the high needs of the breed but there were a few issues such as ""accidently dropping food for the dogs when preparing meals"" that I didn't agree with. Ended up fast forwarding through some of it - although the section on the dogs at the dog pool and swimming was very funny."
5,Beautiful!,"Another winner by Derek Bell - this is an excellent recording. There is quite a bit of variety in the selections, and he uses various types of harps as well. From a musical standpoint, these pieces are captivating. Wonderful arrangements and great playing. I love this CD!"
3,A light read that spawned a classic film,"This novelette was adapted into the feature film ""The Earrings of Madame de"" directed by Marcel Ophuls (1953). The book is a brief, light comedy of manners. The film is a classic of style and glamor that adds great depth to the simple story and draws it to a darker conclusion. See the film."
4,PSYCHOTROPHIC DRUG HANDBOOK,"This product is very informative and well written. However, the spiral binding leaves a lot to be desired. The book itself should be LARGER. Whenever I turn the pages, the ends rip from the spirals. Eventually, as more pages rip...I'm going to have to dismantle it, place the pages in plastic page protector sheets, and slap the entire book in a 3-ring binder, just to keep it for future reference!!"
4,"More room, but a bit of a pain to install","If I could grade this like kids used to get double grades (effort/ability) , I'd give this an ""A"" for concept, and an ""F"" for installation. This thing was a nightmare to install -- my husband was almost ready to throw it out.However, now that it's up, we love the added room in the shower. We have a 1960's tract house with a little rectangular bath and over the bath shower. We couldn't build out the bath without demoing the walls. This gives us more elbow room and a much nicer bath without the demo cost. All in all, it's worth a half-day's suffering."
5,Best (highly-advanced!) ATL 3.0 book on the market,"I have them all (and they're well worth having -- at normal consulting rates, a book will pay for itself if it saves you half an hour's worth of effort!), but this one is _the_ best (and has saved me _several_ hours' worth of my time!) -- if, that is, you're already an expert on COM and C++, with some working knowledge of VC++ and ATL (this is NOT, repeat NOT, a _primer_!). Get good primers (Lippman, Grimes, ...) AND this book."
4,This book is da bomb,"I have 5+ ATL books on my shelf, including the MSPress one, but I always reach for this book first when I have ATL questions. Hopefully there will be a refresh soon to add CE/PocketPC and ATL Server topics."
5,Chapter 3 is awesome!!!,I took an exacto knife and sliced chapter 3 and chapter 7 out of the binding and made them into separate books (I call them 'minibooks'). This book has got 'mojo'.
4,Early indication is good,"The authors have written three ATL 3.0 articles for MSJ (Feb - Apr 99) based on the book and the articles are very informative. Hard to find information about developing ActiveX controls is provided in an easy to understand format. If the book contains as much useful information as the articles, it will be a great book."
1,A dispensable reference,I agree with the other reviewer -- I only wish I had listened and not bought the book. This is a guide. I recommend looking for something better for a person who isn't looking for printed MSDN text.
1,Poorly written/ doesn't flow,"Yes, maybe one of the best coverages of ATL at a useable level, BUT I think they are poor writers. did there best to write as little as possible and still cover their TOC"
1,This is a joke,"Who on earth thought this item was even worth manufacturing?I've had a lot of dish mops over the years. Most held up 6 months to a year. So I know a little about what dish mops should be like.This item is not a dish mop. It's a stick with a few cotton strings on the end - a dish mop wannabee. The plastic handle was flimsy. I wouldn't expect it to last one decent round when used to wash dishes. It feels like a child's toy.I wanted to toss it in the trash the moment I opened the package, but decided I could probably use it for light furniture dusting, a much less demanding job."
1,Dish Mop???,"Seller shipped item on time, but that is where the good ends.The Item: EXTREMELY LOW QUALITY & definitely will not hold up to regular dishwashing. In my opinion, it won't last 2 weeks.This so-called Dish Mop is a short, twisted piece of hard wire with cotton/poly loops & a cheap, plastic handle that will break with very little pressure.PRICE: Is not justified at all. It looks like it should be priced no more than $.99 at one of those types of stores. Instead, it was almost $6.00! ABSOLUTELY ABSURD!Do NOT buy this item! You will feel ripped off. This item does NOT belong on Amazon."
1,Three such dismal reviews can't be wrong!,"I tossed my old dish mop and can't believe how hard it is to find a new one locally. I thought I wanted one of these, but three such dismal reviews can't be wrong."
1,Birdell Cleaning Dish Mom 230-48,"Very disappointed. Mop part is so skimpy that the metal it is attached to scratces surfaces of dishes and pans. I have ordered dishmops from other manufacturers that were VERY good. In fact, I was replacing my worn out one. Had to toss it in the trash. Scratched my brand new kettle! Needs about 10 times more material in mop head! First Amazon order I've been so disappointed in, though!"
1,WOULD NOT EJECT THE VHS TAPE - BROKEN,I guess it wasn't the product fault...it was a refurbished machine that had something overlooked. I am in the process of sending it back
3,Not Up to Par,"I was disappointed in the general quality of this system.The speakers are great, total JBL quality, but the interactionof the unit, such as tape noise, cd spin noise, was notacceptable on this price unit.I am considering returning it."
4,Does what it should,"As a beginning exerciser looking to lose 15 pounds, I can say that this workout is exactly what I was looking for. Generally, I dread circuit training workouts, but I don't mind this one at all. Some say the moves are basic, but I like that about the workout. They are tried and true moves that are easy to follow. It gets my heart rate up really well, but doesn't make me feel like dying like Jillian Michael's 30 Day Shred. I can see how this might not be ideal for advanced exercisers, it is great for beginners, intermediate, and advanced (using heavier weights).Alternating circuits taking a break every 5th day for 3 weeks has helped me lose 7 pounds without really changing my diet. And there is no dread factor."
4,Mixed review,These are two good workouts for days when you don't have too much time. Trouble is the instructor.. She is projects way too much and doesn't seem to realize that her style is not appropriate for the DVD format. The joke that is funny the first time is not funny after that. I bet if she had to pop this DVD in and try and workout to it every day for a week she would be ready to gag before the end of the week. Instructors need to keep it simple and not get funny or cute during the workout. Also save the special instructions for the introduction when it will be viewed once for informational purposes but won't need to be heard every time the video is played ad nauseam.
3,Prefer her original Hollywood Trainer workouts,"I bought Jeanette's new book which came with a DVD that includes this set of workouts plus the core and stretch workouts. I was disappointed. Her original Hollywood Trainer workouts also alternate cardio and weight work. I tried the first circuit workout on the DVD and felt that there were too few reps and actually very little cardio, so the breaks between weight sets seemed wasted.If you do both circuits, you do get a full-body workout, but you're better off doing just ONE of her original workouts. In those, you'll get an at-least-intermediate-level weight workout plus cardio blasts in between all in under an hour.If you want a good intermediate to high intermediate workout, check out her original Hollywood Trainer Cardiosculpt or Kickbox workouts. My go-to Jeanette workout is her Ultimate Cross-Train (all but yoga) plus [...] and Thigh Blast. GREAT for upper and lower body!"
4,Good workout,"This is a good exercise dvd and offers two different workouts. The only thing is they should be more different - not the same exercises for obliques or quads, change it up a bit. In any case Jeannette is a keeper."
5,this is great!,This is a great DVD. Jeanette is like a real person and the workout is great. So far I'm not bored either.
3,Good...,"This CD is good, with only a couple of really stand-out songs. In fact, I heard of this CD through singing ""Enloqueceme"" in my third-year Spanish class. The beats are catchy and fluid, and most Latin or Spanish music lovers will enjoy it."
3,"Esta ""ok.""","When i first got it i was so excited because i would finally hear one of the songs that my friend was always talking about. Then i heard the music: it wasn't all that great. I was expecting more. The songs are very ""poppy."" After a while though, i liked the songs more because i got used to them. There are maybe 3 or 4 songs that seem ""ok."""
5,Great CD,"Wow, i stil can't believe I got it, i remeber that i had 13 years old when i first hear about OV7, I looked for this Cd everywhere,I love all the songs, they are great, if you want to buy this Cd do it, you wont be sorry"
2,not what I thought,These 4 DVDs are of his youngest days in TV. I thought they would have some early Tonight Shows. That disappointed me.
3,MY ERROR,. . .didn't know if was all DVDs from his first years in show business--was expecting The Tonight Show.DVDs are in extraordinary condition--excellent quality.
3,Bass,Product came in well. no problems. But i would say the album is pretty cheesy. But that;s o.k. cuz i like cheesy music.
2,Interesting but not credible,"John Keel is one of the better writers in the UFO genre and quite imaginative. This book offers a ""what if"" scenario that has obviously not come to pass. If the beginning premise is that UFOs could be anything then this book almost has an air of plausibility. Almost. As is becoming apparent, UFOs from 1945 on appear to be man-made craft. The military and governments of all countries have responded in the same way: ridicule, denial, and more recently, the release of documents and records that show confusion and intense interest, at least in the early days, but, ultimately, no definitive action, aside from further denials and 'official' disinterest. Are UFOs a threat? Apparently not. Will UFOs go away? Apparently not."
1,Shipped on time but parts are MISSING!,"Although the item came within 10 days, it did not come with the AC adaptor. I have tried calling the customer service number located in the user guide for 2 weeks now and no one picks up the phone. I only get connected to a voice messaging system which NO ONE has returned yet. This is a christmas gift and it is very unfortunate that the gift won't be ready in time. I'm highly disappointed. This is an expensive item, and for it to not be functional is unacceptable."
1,Feedback,The VHS I purchased doesn't work. When I put it in it's black and white and is scrambled. Products should be tested before they are sold.
4,great choice for Chip 'N Dale lovers,"I had been trying to find a reasonablely priced video on Chip 'N Dale, as my 2 yr. old just adores them. Although it is VHS, this collection contains enough great material to keep her happy and at a reasonable price. I recommend the title for any C 'N D lover."
3,"ChipNDale, not my favorites, but cute cute & cute!","I love Disney movies and am trying to start my collection again since I lost many videos as a young child, but one movie that I did purchase was this one and just seeing it made me feel like a kid again. Being hearing impaired, I would love to turn up the sound to hear the little pitter patters of Chip N'Dale. Anyone who is a child at heart should get this movie!Amy"
5,"Very funny, great at writing dog's internal dialogue","This book is very funny and inventive. I really enjoy the small northern California town it is set in, I also appreciate that he keeps coming back to many of the same characters in some of his books, but the books aren't all centered around a single one. However, what really stands out about this book for me are the thoughts that go on inside the mind of the dog. I like dogs a lot and I found this part of the book to be laugh-out-loud funny and quite possibly true."
5,Shapeshifting is for Tanker Lovers,"Steve is a shapeshifting sea beast who has a thing for eating paperboys and shagging oil tankers and he's just come to visit the small Californian town of Pine Cove just south of Big Sur, where the local shrink has taken all her unwitting patients off anti-depressants and they're now swallowing sugar pills.Town members include our unlikely hero, rent-a-cop Theo Crowe who has a serious bong habit, an ex B movie star, an eccentric artist, a rat-tracker and his dog and a blues player called Catfish among others.Is this book scary? How can you be scared when you're laughing so hard? Funny, funny, funny. 'Nuff Said."
5,By far the funniest book I've ever read!,"...I have never laughed so hard over and over again at a book as I did this one. Unfortunately for me I am now spoiled as to what is truly hilarious and find I use Christopher Moore's books (all of them, but particularly Lust Lizard) as the standard. To-date nothing even comes close. I have recommended this book, as well as all of Mr. Moore's books, to other friends that all have different ideas of what they consider funny and none of them have come up disappointed. I am jealous of anyone that hasn't read this book yet as they are in for a great experience!"
4,THIS BOOK MADE ME A FAN,This was the first Christopher Moore book I ever read and it made me an instant fan. It's difficult to pin down a specific genre because it's both humor and sci-fi. A monster arrives in town and falls in love with a woman. Everyone else in town begins to feel amorous. Very quirky characters. Laugh out loud situations and turns of phrase. Highly recommended.
4,Getting Better,"This is the second book by Moore that I've read. The first was Practical Demonkeeping, the prequel (sort of) to Lust Lizard. Have to say this one was better. Although still nothing fantastic by any means, it was funnier and had a more interesting plot than Demonkeeping. I think Moore has improved over the years, and maybe he'll keep getting better. I don't think he'll ever be great, but I'll probably be reading more of his stuff in the future."
3,The Monster equivalent of a Harlequin Romance,"Maybe my expectations were too high, but I thought this book was more corny than funny. If you remove the sexual content you would have one of those 70s Wide World of Disney stories. That's not to say it's not entertaining, - it's quick and easy reading that won't win any literary awards but will keep you entertained for the short amount of time it takes to read."
3,Not Great,"I was hoping for something remotely like Tom Robbins' untouchable wit and imagination. Didn't get it. Fine to read at the beach or on a plane, but really just light entertainment. He certainly made an effort with the off-beat plot, but the writing didn't really carry it. It did remind me a bit of Carl Hiassen -- reasonably entertaining, but not inspirational."
3,"Clever construction, cheesy prose.","""Lust Lizard"" is a script disguised as a novel. As a script, it's quite clever in it's construction and resolution. As a novel the writing is weak. It's an enjoyable enough read, but the prose made me wince at times."
2,"No Moore, please... thanks.","I quite often found the book loosing ground at times with a creative story line pulled together with odd characters. It has silly humor no doubt but, at times seemed like the author was stealing from Theo's little garden. Definitely light reading for those who need a giggle or two."
4,Lusting for moore,"Christopher Moore is a very sick, disturbed individual. I love that in a writer! If you do too, you'll love this book. Especially if you don't offend easily, don't care much for the religious right, and appreciate anyone who can work the word ""slugfest"" into the story in an original way. In a N. California tourist town, everyone goes cold turkey on their Prozac simultaneously. That's when the Beast is let loose, literally and figuratively. An aging B movie star tries to tame him-Steve, the literal beast, in some very creative and thankfully not very detailed ways. (""That's all you need to know about that""). I enjoyed this as all of Moore's prior works. He has some common themes throughout all of them but they don't seem all the same, as many writers tend to get. You'll appreciate the details and the research of Moore's writing. Looking forward to his next one."
4,Better than the love nun,"Very funny and entertaining. I've read all of Christopher Moore's books and with the exception of Island of the Sequinned Loved Nun, all were great. Buy this book - we have an obligation to support good writers!"
5,Mel Brookes meets The Creature from the Black Lagoon,"And Mark Twain edited the film.Chris Moore hasn't written a single book that couldn't leave me blue in the face from laughter but this one is the best yet! I haven't finished and I had to sign on and plug it. I see I'm not the first person with that reaction, either. This kind of laughter can double for aerobics. If we handed out more Moore we'd need less Prozac. Lust Lizard therapy."
4,Mean Green Laugh Machine,"The pace of laughs per page is a bit lower on this one than some of Moore's other books. Still, it's full of interesting characters, hallarious situations, and great one liners.The plot is out there even for more. Take your usual B-movie Giant Monster plot, and center it around a seabeast (called Steve) Then add some strange love stories, put it in a blender, add some strong perception warping drugs, and you've got this book. The zany plot in a nutshell is this: a seabeast decides to start feeding in a small California town. The town constable is a pothead, but he's actually on the right track as he starts to investigate the strange goings on. There's plenty more going on but I suggest you read it yourself.It's not quite as funny as Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, Good Omens, or some of Moore's other work, but still worth reading if your into this kind of fiction."
5,Bizarre funny out of this world humor,"Got to love this author. Christopher Moore delivers funny out-of-this-world characthers that you are going to love and want to be pals with, like Molly Michon. I envisioned her like a Xena, the warrior princess has-been. And when you read one of Moore books, you don't know where the story it's going, just have to hang, enjoy the ride and laught out loud with all the bizarre situations that happen at Pine Cove. Excellent read!"
4,Lust Lizard is a hoot!,One of my more favorite Christopher Moore books. It had me laughing throughout the book!
2,surprised,being a big chris fan i expected more. this was a big let down with unrelateable comedy and dry jokes. not a favorite.
4,My favorite Pine Cove book,"This was my favorite of the three Pine Cove books. Here we get what Moore does best -- a colorful cast of characters mired in an extremely unusual situation. In this case, there's a mysterious sea beast in town, making the newly un-drugged residents of Pine Cove somewhat... amorous. Constable Theo Crowe knows *something* is going on, but he's not too sure what. All he knows is that he doesn't believe housewife Bess Leander killed herself, and it's up to him to find out who really killed her. The only one who really has an idea of what is going on is mostly-out-of-her-mind ex-B-movie-queen Molly Michon, and who's going to believe her? This is the Moore I first enjoyed with A Dirty Job."
3,fun silly summer read,"This was a fun, silly summer read. Some good lines and imagery. Not quite as fun as some of his other books."
4,"""What horrors can a dragon dream?""","When an ancient lizard whips the population of Pine cove into a lustful frenzy, all hell breaks loose. The pothead constable of the town, Theo, has his hands full. So does the local psychiatrist who has taken 30% of the local populace of their psychiatric medications. The only one that can save them is Kendra, the Warrior Babe!Moore is the master of flip, hip humor. He carries off a silly fantastical plot with aplomb and makes you wish for more. His sly commentary on modern culture and human idiosyncrasies keep you chuckling. His loony characters and their zany adventures provide enjoyment from page to page!"
4,Funny and engaging,"I don't normally read fiction. But I enjoyed Lamb so much that I thought I'd read another Chris Moore book. Most of my friends suggested Lust Lizard.Although it's not nearly as complex or deep as Lamb, it is a enjoyable read. It's light, funny, and has characters that are fairly well defined. I particularly like the passages that are from the dog's point of view.This reads much like the funnier parts of Lamb (sorry, that's the only other CM book I have to compare it to at this point). If you're looking for more depth, this probably isn't it. But if you want an entertaining book that doesn't require a lot of thinking, go for it."
4,The Lust Lizard of Melancholy Cove,"The book looks very well worn, which is fine by me because it signifies a very good book. I just started reading it and already like it. The book arrived earlier than expected. :)"
2,Barely readable,"Not only is this thing an impossible premise, the style leaves one wandering about in limbo between episodic adventures. The characters, except for the Constable, are overwrought and unbelievable. Attempts at ironic humor are sophomoric. I say this, in spite of having thoroughly enjoyed both earlier books by Christopher Moore.Fool: A NovelLamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal"
3,Christopher Moore's Lust Lizard,"Typical Moore book. Funny and entertaining. If I had not ready Lamb first, I would have given it 5 stars. I don't know if he can top Lamb"
2,Interesting but boring,"Really slow book but parts were really strange and interesting. I wouldn't recommend it really...he has better books like ""A Dirty Job."""
5,too funny,Loved it ......... Loved it ........ Loved it.................and loved it some more.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! here are my eight more words words words
5,the lust lizard of melancholy cove,book was in excellent condition and came in a timely manner. Gave as agift to Christopher Moore fan.
1,Worked good..for four cassettes...now it's broke.,"I purchased this item just to use for listening to older audiobooks on cassette from the local library. Since the cassette format has practically died out, I didn't want to spend alot of money for outdated technology. Well, the unit stopped working after only four cassettes and changing batteries didn't help. Since the price was so low, I didn't even bother returning it and will see if the titles that I would like to listen to are available from surrounding libraries on cd or will purchase them via audio downloads.Would have been nice if this product worked..but it doesn't."
1,Very poor sound quality and quickly broken,"A few weeks ago I bought this tape recorder as a cheap solution to listen to my French homework tapes. Because I am a college student, I am constantly trying to find ways to cut expenses. However, I was very disappointed with what I received.The tape recorder had very bad sound quality. It did not read the tapes well, and made it very difficult to listen to.""Sehherehehrhere"" was its constant background noise.""BRUBRUBRUBRUBRUBRU"" was its weird low-frequency oddly low sound qualityThe other, old tape recorder I wanted to replace worked even better than this one.After only two weeks of working poorly, my new purchase completely broke and is now unusable. In hindsight, I wish I would have spent a few more dollars to get something that actually worked. I ended up having to buy another tape recorder anyway.I rarely write negative reviews, but this cassette player clearly deserved it."
1,Cassette Player,Was unhappy with the purchase. The radio played fine but the cassette portion had problems. The play button seemed to have a short and would not always play. I have to play with it to get it to play and keep playing. A replacement unit was sent and it was worse than the first. The cassette player would not play at all.
5,Worked great for two years--I'm satisfied...,I purchased this cassette player/radio in July 2008 and have used it almost daily for listening to books on tape. It stopped working yesterday. I definitely got my $$'s worth and will be ordering another.
3,Cassette Player,Pleased with products and were purchased to send to mission field in Africa so audio tapes can be heard.Probably the radio will be worthless but price was right and batteries were sent.
5,great tape cassette player,Sound is perfect. Great to use for cassettes I enjoyed that were collecting dust. Sound is clear and wonderful. Feel like I got a big present as I am discovering cassettes I forgot I had....
1,Still waiting for this one...,"I ordered this product and as yet, have not received it. After 4 phone calls with operators that barely speak English and did not understand me, I have given up on receiving this product and have written off the money as a lesson learned about connecting English speaking customers to non-English speaking service agents. I am very disappointed in Amazon because of this product and the problems I've had over it. It will not stop me from using Amazon in the future, but it has put a damper in the trust I had for the company. I will be wary from here on out when buying directly from Amazon not because of the products, but because of the agents they choose to represent them."
1,Don't buy,"The quality of this item is very poor! The first one broke in a week, the vendor was great and replaced it No Charge. But, it has a 10 hour battery life, poor sound quality. Save yourself the trouble, spend another $10 and get something worth it."
1,Shiping charge,"Cassette Player with Bass Boost JX-B32AOther products by jWINNo customer reviews yet. Be the first.| More about this product--------------------------------------------------------------------------------List Price: $8.99Price: $7.35You Save: $1.64 (18%)Availability: In Stock. Ships from and sold by SkyBox-USA.It seems like a waste of time searching for a shipping charge, in dollars and cents. Even though another page shows a shipping charge in cost per pound, I have no idea how much the item weighs wen packaged and shipped. Without a final shipping charge, in dollars and cents, ordering this or any other item, is a gamble."
1,JWIN JXB32A,"Before I purchased this product I would have liked to have known that it did not have a review button. I had never before seen a cassette player without this feature; in fact, I didn't know such a thing existed. As it is, the product is completely useless for me. I think the description of the product should make it clear that it is impossible to rewind the tape!"
1,What do you expect if the product made in China?,"I have purchased one for my father. It stopped playing the cassettes in about 4 months. I have tried to clean the roller but it did not help.Don't buy junk, folks!"
1,I don't care about the low price-they are lousy headphones.,"they sound like you are in a tunnel. If you are a real music lover and don't use music just for backround noise or distraction on the treadmill, you will not like these. Luckily, I didn't buy them for myself."
3,good for price,"These are great headphones for the price. The only real problem with them is that they lack any treble or high end. It becomes very apparent when you switch between different headphones. Bass and mids are good because it's a sealed over-ear design, and this deadens background noise which is an added plus. The ear-pieces themselfs are comfy and don't hurt your head after long hours of wearing them. Surprisingly, despite being made of cheap plastic my pair has not broken after 2 years of use. All these headphones need are a pair of tweeters to be perfect."
2,Spoiled,"Attractive packaging, some great games... but the games are incomplete, edited without notice. Cheaply produced documentaries and double-sided discs further spoil the presentation."
3,Bulls teams were better than this set,"First of all, each of the 6 Chicago Bulls championship teams were great teams. The DVDs are perfect for lazy evenings or age-group team barbecues, but I do have two complaints:1) The games are not in fact ""complete"" or ""as it happened"" - significant chunks are cut out of the games, especially 1998 game six. Several minutes are skipped. (On the other hand, I really appreciate the lack of commercials during the time-outs.)2) These may be Jordan's best games of each series (I'm not even sure about that), but they are not the team's defining games. For instance, from the Lakers series I would have preferred game 2, where the Bulls found the answer to Magic Johnson won their first finals game; from the Blazers series, game 6, where Pippen lead the reserves in a great 4th quarter comeback to win the series. On the other hand, the 1993 (Paxson's 3) and 1998 (Jordan on Russell) selections are spot-on.Nice set but I'm docking two stars for these issues."
2,Unfortunate Poor Quality and Incomplete,"The picture quality is so poor you can't make out the players at times. The NBA saw fit to put in advertising, for themselves. The games are incomplete, skipping most free throws and some of the game but they kept a lot of worthless Marv Albert dribble. The potential for this DVD set was enormous, what a disappointment with so many great moments missing. I am such a big Bulls Fan I would have bought this set even knowing what I know now, just don't get your hopes up too much. Shame on the NBA for not doing justice to the best team in history, and their fans."
5,BULLS Dynasty Greatest EVER,DVD is great well worth the money for any bulls fan or baskeball fan. MUST OWN.
2,So-so series doesn't take advantage of its talent,"I purchased this set for the ""Soul Man"" segment starring James Marsters and Roger Daltrey. None of the four stories, however is all that engaging despite having some notable actors taking part. The stories are somewhat predictable, the acting is uneven (Peter Strauss appears to be sleepwalking through his performance although his segment is perhaps the most interesting), and since each of them is rather brief you have little time to be engaged by the characters even when the actors have something to work with. Best rented rather than purchased, I doubt many will want to review these stories more than once."
3,I love John Taylor,"I purchased this movie for one reason only: JOHN TAYLOR. I have to say that the film is okay. It was broadcast on VH1, and that is how I first saw it. I was excited that it was actually a DVD to purchase. I can only say it deals with a kinda sci-fi, paranormal kind of thing. The story is not cohesive and has separate segments to which I care only about the segment with Mr. Taylor. The film is meant to be kind scary film. It was ok."
2,"looks cool, fly's poorly",the tail is useless. Need to experiment and build your own tail or it will be unstable crash machine. Looks very cool in the garage
4,Good times,"This album brings back so many memories for me. I was quite young when Herman's Hermits was popular, but I do remember their radio hits. My brother bought ""Blaze"" and I somehow ended up with it. I was only around six years old, but I played it non-stop on my little record player. Well, it's been over thirty years since I've heard it, but this album has always stuck with me. I would find myself singing pieces of songs that I remembered from it, so I decided to look and see if it was available in cd format, and to my delight it was. I ordered it, and I could hardly wait to get it open and play it. It was definitely worth the purchase, but if you are a fan of their pop radio hits, this album may not be for you. As for me, this was my favorite album they put out.If you've got a pack of troubleWeighing on your worried mindIf you tend to see things doubleAnd you can't unwindTake a trip to green street greenGet yourself a little sceneEverything is kind of groovyDown at green street green."
5,Fun! With a Twist!,"My college age son kept very few books from his childhood years, but this was his #1 choice! It is a story about how everyone can work together and make the impossible possible. I loved reading this book to my sons almost as much as they loved hearing it! It should be a family heirloom that gets passed down from generation to generation."
1,Bad Quality,It broke within 2 weeks. The wood frames are really weak and frail. It did not take much (baby clothes) to brake one of the parts of the frame and the whole thing fell apart.
2,Less than sturdy,Wobbly and easily broken. We've had to glue/tape the legs back together more than once. It's cute but won't last long.
2,Misinformed about this product,"The recording is fairly old, actually recorded in 1950, but mastered in 2001, which is unfortunately the only date in the purchasing information. Not to mention this was chosen to be, by the conductor, performed in German, not in French which was what I was looking for. Please be advised this is a German language product, and not a very good one, unfortunately.Melmusic"
1,StarForce!!!,"This game has StarForce copy protection, which is software that you do NOT want on your computer. Reportedly, it replaces your CD and/or DVD drivers, and often causes extreme hardware and software problems. I've been a victim of the software problems, it basically crippled my very expensive SCSI scanners and it was extremely difficult to figure out what was doing it. It could be the best game that's ever been produced, but anyone who's had the StarForce experience is going to steer clear. I don't know why a company would knowingly try to sell you software that is known to cause so many problems, it's downright malicious."
1,This game has software that can harm your computer.,"Starforce is a copy protection program that can harm your computer. It eats up CPU power, and causes slow downs. This cannot be removed. Stay away from this."
1,Not worth the money... and it's only $6,"I've really tried to use this timer for the past 6 months but sometimes it doesn't ring, other times it rings early, sometimes it just stops ticking. I've officially burned too much food and tossed it in the garbage. Ugh."
1,junk timer,"this is junk, not accurate, do not purchase, a waste of money. may only last a another week. did not work properly out of the package"
1,Zero for two,Bought one; didn't work (reached the end of the timing period but wouldn't ring); returned it; got another; same problem.
2,Worked for a day or two,"OK firstly i guess you get what you pay for is the main thing i would say.The timer is exactly what you would expect for such a price, plastic and cheap.Now for the negative..The timer worked fine for the first day or two and then.. whammy!Now you can sit and watch an hour go by in a matter of 3 minutes or less!If you are looking for a timer please consider purchasing a digital version as this is utterly useless."
3,oven timer,Item works well. I expected the numbers to be larger ( My wife is visually impared) However she can use it alright.
2,Taylor Timer,I thought this timer would be good but I only have had it since Dec.and it will not work. You put it on a certain time and it stopsworking. I will not buy this product again. I paid more for theshipping than the product was worth.
5,A nice loud timer,"I have had mine for almost 5 months. So far I have not had any problems with it whatsoever. It is holding up well in our household. It is plain, sturdy, reliable, and practical. That's just what I look for in kitchen items. I am happy with it."
1,You get what you pay for,"I've had this timer for a while now and always had to nurse it along to get it to work by rapping it on its side after I set it. Also, always make sure to turn past 30 when setting it (winds up the internal spring).Well, I got tired of this procedure which worked if I was lucky about 50% of the time. It finally got tired itself and stopped working almost all the time now. It really is a piece of junk as many reviewers have stated here and has been relegated to the garbage bin. I don't know why I stayed with it so long. Save yourself the trouble and spring for a digital unit even if it's not as nostalgic."
1,Bad junk,Ridiculous product. Can easily be off by a minute on short timings and more on long ones. Look further.
1,Should Be Sold In The Toy Dept.,"Another cheap, defective Chinese knock-off that I guess Taylor allowed their name to be attached to. Avoid."
1,Piece of Junk...,Read the description carefully--it's a MECHANICAL timer. The alarm is armed with the spring-loaded dial. So the length is determined by the amount of winding you put to the dial--not very accurate and the alarm bell lasts only as much as you wind the dial--its sound is very harsh and gradually dies down as the spring winds down.I suppose this alarm could be good for the elderly because of its large numbers on the face and the dial...
5,Nami's frist tear in 8 years.,"It...was awsome!!!!!Belleme`re was a brave women.That let's me know that women can be brave,too!And,Nami didn't join Arlong's crew for money,she joined him for love of Belleme`re!!That makes me all warm and fuzzy(Not really,though.)!And,when Sanji says something to a girl,what's up with the heart!!?Oh well.Old happit,I guess."
4,Good indicator,"It's a good indicator. Nice construction. The dials are a touch loose and the inning counter makes it a little crowded. But for the price, it can't be beat."
4,Worth Reading More Than Once,"Like any good book on writing poetry, this one is worth reading more than once. The advice is good. The teaching is good (particularly on the sounds of poetry). The reproduced poems are excellent examples of the craft and art of poetry. Even the suggested activities/exercises are pretty good. (I'm not a fan of writing exercises.) Recommended, for sure."
5,Imaginative Energy,"Jeff Mock's book is personal and sincere. Inspiring stories and example poems with engaging exercises. A meat-and-potatoes guide with gormet flavor. ""Write to discover..."" one of many empowering insights. Embraceable and downright fun. I'm buying a copy for my daughter."
2,Only good for the kids.,"For those who say this is 'fun for the whole family' I must disagree. Everything about this film is substandard and as an adult I found it extremely tiresome. After reading some favorable reviews I kept watching, hoping that it would change for the better. My kids didn't care for it much either.As a fan of Scarlett Johansson I found this to be one to avoid. All of the dialogue and acting is sub-par. The only bright spot is Eva Mendes as the nanny, who may not have turned in the best performance of her career but is at least believable. If you really feel you must then rent it for the kids. If they truly love it then buy it. But don't pay more than one or two dollars."
5,Eva Mendes my wife she loves me,"Im Eva Mendes number one fan. She loves me, just acts a lil stuck up cuz i havent beat up enough people yet. With the right traighning and conditioning i will beat up anyone who wants a piece of Stitch."
2,JUVENILE FANTASY,"From 1999 comes this outing featuring the young Scarlett Johansson, whose career since then has been remarkably ascendant. ""The Horse Whisperer,"" made at about the same time, is a far better barometer of the talent this fine actress can display. ""My Brother the Pig"" is more appropriately aimed at the Saturday Matinee at the Movies crowd. Eva Mendes and Judge Reinhold are on board to help, but it's all very predictable and suitable mainly for an audience of elementary school mentalities."
4,value for money,i am not a fan of those shoe racks that are flimsy and plastic-y (and look like shoe racks)but no one wants to spend too much money on something just for shoes so this shelf-like shoe rack was ideal. it sits outside our door and organizes shoes without making it look too tacky. really easy to assemble and plenty of space under the 1st shelf for more shoes on the floor. my husband complains it's flimsy and it probably is for anything more than shoes and clothes. you can probably put screws in it if you are using it for something else (which makes a wood shelf so much more versatile than a dedicated plastic shoe rack). but i like it.
4,Just what I needed.,"I bought 3 of these for my closet. Gave 1 to my husband and kept 2 for myself. We use ours for shoes. My husband can fit 3 pairs of shoes on each tier and I can store 4 pairs side by side. We stacked the 2 on my side of the closet using the pegs that came with the shelf. Shelf is very light weight and seems kind of fragile, but works well for shoes."
5,Great,"This was my all time favorite book, it was great. the characters were portrayed very well. The way that Gloria Murphy twisted everything around was great and very interesting. She is such a great writer. She really knows how to keep people interested."
3,Worth a read,This book is worth a try. Simon's motive is defiently interesting and the twist of events kept me reading. I didn't care for the character Lucas at all. I can't figure out why all of a sudden Cat figured Simon wasn't good for them after she slept with him? What gave her any real idea that he was trying to butt in after she was with him on the boat? It just didn't make sense.
4,Very good!,This books gives good insight to the life and motivations of Norman Rockwell. It has good photographs of his work as well.
2,Norman Rockwell: A Life,Title: Norman Rockwell: A Life The book has too many facts that are not interesting. There is more infomation about past generations that I didn't want to read.
4,As Described. Interesting book.,Very informative book of an interesting man. A man who had some interesting concepts and portraits of timeless American life.
5,"An american icon, re-examined",Rockwell's life and art were much more complicated than popular history would have you believe and this book really gets down to the nitty-gritty. I was particularly interested in reading about his early history and how different it was from the ideal Americana that people usually associate with him. Definitely an eye-opener and a great read!
1,A Disappointment,"I found this book very difficult to read for the following reasons. First, the text is in serious need of a good editor and could be cut by 20 to 30%. Second, the prose is difficult to read not because it contains profound thoughts, but that the sentences seem to be ""tangled"" and eccentrically constructed. Third there is too much psycho nonsense. Even professional psychiatrists tend to tread very carefully when discussing subjects that they have never met - Anthony Storrs on Sir Winston Churchill or the late John Mack on T. E. Lawrence. Psycho babble about Norman Rockwell doesn't teach us anything and only makes the author seem foolish."
2,"Clunky controls, inconsistent recording","Awkward clunky controls make this a poor choice for someone who wants to use the product regularly. The VAS and general recording is also clunky, because it takes two seconds for the first sounds to get recorded. You need to take a deep breath after you push RECORD and then stay the same distance from the microphone, or else you'll get a choppy recording. Worse still, the unit MAY NOT RECORD if the case is not closed in a certain way. It looks like it's recording, but then doesn't record. What is the point of a tape recorder if you can't trust it?I finally got sick of the thing and bought a Sony M-470. It was a few $ more but well worth it. My favorite all-time recorder was my old Panasonic RN-305, but after 5 years of continuous use, it broke. Luckily, the Sony is almost as good."
3,JWIN JXR16 Does the Job,"I have fifty or more micro cassettes in a box which contain tons of creative material that I have logged over the years. My old Micro Cassette Recorder no longer qualifies as a Micro Cassette Recorder so I needed a new one so that I could listen and evaluate all the old brain droppings from years past. As it is 2009 I currently have a digital micro recorder whose contents I can dump into my computer, but that's another story. I needed a reasonably priced device which would allow me to listen to all this junk. the JWIN JXR16 was equal to the task."
1,a waste of money,"This microcassette recorder was very inexpensive, and I definitely got what a paid for. Construction quality feels cheap, but most importantly, the sound quality is awful. I thought perhaps the tapes I ordered were the problem, and ordered higher quality tapes. It made no difference.Don't waste your money on this product. I gave it to my daughter to use as a toy, as it is usless to me. I would not recommend."
3,Smells nice...,"... And works, I think. It's not the easiest thing to use and if you go swimming or sweat you need to reapply constantly. On vacation I ended up just using something else."
2,"A bit better, but still not worth the money...","Rabe tells a better story than her awful fifth age trilogy, but the caracters are still too thin and child-like, the plot too dull and the inconsistency with all preceeding dragonlance still abound. Is there no editor at TSR who read those books and tells Rabe that there wasn't any Knights of Takhisis in 352!!!I hope that the War of Souls trilogy by Weis & Hickman comes out soon to clean Rabe's mess up once and for good. It was a mistake to hire an author without any feel and any knowledge of Krynn.Read the Chaos War Series instead. Those books rocks!"
2,Another weak attempt by Jean Rabe,All the Dragonlance books I have read by her have been poor. She just cannot get me into the story. She does not have the skills.
2,Below Average Dragonlance Offering,"As far as Forgottten Realms or Dragonlance books go, this is one I wish I hadn't paid money for. The plot is thin and the narrative wanders. The book drags on forever with unexciting subplots. Borrow it from a friend or the library but spend your hard earned money elsewhere."
4,She's getting better...,"Rabe, you have to admit, is getting to be a much better author. Her first novel of the Fifth Age, (Dawning of A New Age) was shallow in depth and thought. This novel is good, i found it hard to leave without picking it up again, and is definately a book that breathes some life into the Bridges of Time series, after the bland Spirit of the Wind novel by Chirs Pierson. Gair was such an admirable character, even after he became posessed, and i almost cried after the scene with Goldmoon & Camilla at his grave. A definate good read for DL fans."
2,Dry and disjointed. Not worth the effort.,"Given Rabe's previous work on the Dragons of a New Age Trilogy, I was reluctant to pick up this book in the first place. I wish I'd resisted. For those who've endured the aforementioned novels, it should be noted that 'The Silver Stair' is definitely an improvement on her earlier work, but it's still dire. It's laden with inaccuracies that instantly spoil the sparse atmosphere that had been built up, notably Knights of Takhisis building a keep in 352AC (almost twenty years before they were founded), a sorcerer running about on a ship only a year or two following the Second Cataclysm and Goldmoon ascending the Stair without a hint of her fear of heights showing. Even putting all that aside, the story's bland and the plot drags. Only stubbornness made me read it through to the end."
1,Poor,"A very poorly written work and a disapointing read. Unless you just have to read everything Dragonlance puts out, wait for something better."
4,A surprisingly entertaining book,"I never even finished Jean Rabe's Fifth Age Trilogy, and after all the bad comments this book got, I must say I was pretty hesitant to get it. But I did, and after a slow start, I finished the book in one night. I guess it's pretty obvious that I enjoyed it a lot, don't let the sappy cover fool you, this was one of the darker Dragonlance books I've come upon. Gair has got to be one of the more interesting characters ever created. If you can just look past all the historical inacuracies mentioned, blasphemies actually, I think you'd really enjoy this book."
3,The Wedding Dress,This movie is sweet. I like how all the characters end up being connected to each other.
3,"Wedding Dress is good, but predictable.","Thought the movie was charming, acting was excellent, but plot was predictable. Wrapped up in a bow just a bit too much, but pleasant."
2,the wedding dress,I wish this would have a little more back bone. Maybe I just like longer movies. If it were a little more meaty with a little longer plot it would have been a great movie. Instead it leaves you hanging and saying what?
1,An Ok Movie,My friend had told me how this movie was so good so I bought it.....what a mistake! Even on a low-budget film the picture should atleast be good but this was horrible. Plus the acting wasn't that great either.
5,"Gentle, quirky, sweet romantic comedy","I had seen this on the shelf at our public library for months before I finally borrowed & watched it. Very refreshing! Low on violence and immorality, which means it wouldn't be everyone's cup of tea...but I would rate it right alongsidePyromaniac's Love Story [VHS] as a gentle, sweet romantic comedy."
5,A Real Feel-Good Movie,"For all those hopeless romantics out there, this is a movie right up your alley. I have seen this movie on the Hallmark channel (and I have watched it many times now; so many that I just had to have it in my collection) it just makes me feel good after watching it. I love the way the dress connects all the different stories together. And I love a happy ending. Afterall, isn't that why we watch romantic movies? To hope that something like it will happen to us? The characters are real and believable. You really feel like you know them and care about what happens to them. It has become one of my favorites when I just want to sit back and enjoy a good story."
3,Good Clean Family Film,"This movie will not be winning any awards but it is a good clean family movie. It does get a little hard to follow at times. So multitasking while watching this movie is not a good idea. My daughter age 9 liked it, my son and husband couldn't (or wouldn't) keep up. I would recommend it to others but it is like a lifetime movie or made for tv movie."
4,Nicely put together.,"This movie is great romance and is interesting to see how things go. I will not say to much as it will give things away. If you love a romance and puzzler, this is one of those, I think I know what is going to happen next and you don't. Worth buying to watch again."
3,The Wedding Dress,This movie was not close captioned for the hearing impaired and was therefore a disappointment to my family who rely on captions or subtitles due to hearing loss. Can I get this movie with captions (English) or subtitles in English?The book The Wedding Dress was much better than this movie.
1,Where is everything?,"That's what I said when I put Traders Season 1 into my DVD player. Their are NO special features. Now don't get me wrong, if I was reviewing the show, I'd give it 10 out of 5 stars, but I'm reviewing the DVD and it's terrible. Alliance Atlantis put no effort into this realese. All there is are the 13 episodes, subtitiles, and a French dub. Their isn't even a menu for scene selection. If Traders is on T.V., than save your money and just tape the episodes. It's just frustrating to think that Alliance Atlantis didn't put anything intersting like deleted scenes or commentaries onto this. However, it you don't have these episodes on tape and really want to see the show, then buy this DVD since the show its self is amazing."
1,What a shame!,"I read this book the first twenty pages but threw it right away, becaus I could not stand the blaming and constant negative attitude."
1,Estrangement is on its way,Estrangement is on its way if you follow the advise from this book.There are really great books if you need help with your family:1) Toxic Parents by Susan Forward2) If you had controlling parents by Dan Neuhardt3) The family crubicleand many more.
2,Too one-sided,"In her book, LeBey discusses several types of family estrangement, but she tends to tell only one side of what are typically two-sided stories. Relationships between family members are complicated, and the problems that gave rise to the estrangement are often rooted in destructive conduct on the part of both parties to the dispute. I wonder what Ms. LeBey's estranged son (and his wife) think about Ms. LeBey's account of their estrangement and what their side of the story would reveal? If LeBey hopes for reconciliation with her son and daughter-in-law, did she consider that writing her book would probably damage the prospects for reconciliation with them? One can only assume that she did, yet she wrote the book anyway. How ironic."
2,One side of the conflict,"Unfortunately, in almost every relationship covered, the author only addresses one side of the conflict. For this reason the book fails to accomplish it's goal and provide help to ALL those in the conflict. For example, the author relates the story of her estrangement with her son and her daughter-in-law. Many other reviewers have pointed out her obvious lack of attention to the other side of the story - her son's. However, the author also fails to mention her own relationships with her mothers'-in-law during the course of her own marriages. Silence as to these relationships surely leads one to suspect."
1,not too good book,"this book is one sided and that's why I can not make use of it. was looking for severe advise to handle my mother-in-law. unfortunately Lebey only describes her point of view, that daughters-in-law1) have always the fault2) want to control sonsand that's why the family does not work. Could not there be other perspectives in this book please!waste of money because no advise, read the free pages here at amazon and make a choice yourself"
1,Don't Bother!,"Really ZERO starts, but that isn't an option. This is a one-sided view of family problems, putting all of the fault onto the children despite the fact that we were RAISED by these older ""adults"". Does NOT address issues with parents who have problems letting go, honoring thier adult children's views or giving their children a sense of space. A poorly executed book that will make a lot of grandparents and mothers-in-law feel better without truly offering them the chance to change themselves. SKIP THIS ONE if you know what is good for you!"
1,I did not like the book,I could not relate to the blaming of one side. What I looked for was real help and I do not see a way to save a relationship by blaming other people.A cooperative approach to problem solving would be desirable.
2,One sided Perspective,"The author discribes herself as a laywer, wife, mother, and grandmother, but, not a daughter-in-law. Her perspective is quite one-sided against the ""alienating and threatened wife"". Quote ""It bears mentioning that the daughter in law's perspective is not included here since, in almost every instance, it is the family of the estranged son who suffer the alienation of their loved one. The daughter in law does not require skills in copeing because she usually has the option of mending the relationship at any time"".As a d-i-l seeking to understand the actions of a m-i-l , I am dissapointed with the book."
1,Don't cover a book by a judge,"The author is not a psychiatrist. She is not a family counselor. She is not a physician. She is - horror of horrors! - an attorney and ""former judge."" She is also way in over her head with the subject matter, offering nothing more than: Estrangement is unpleasant, we should work to avoid or fix it. Having dispensed with this nugget of advice she spends the rest of the book treading water and repeating her mantra. My advice to the author: Stick to the bar and leave advice giving on how to carry out the heavy emotional lifting to the professionals."
3,Lola Sams,"Two years have passed since I bought it as a birthday present for my husband. When delivered, the winder looked good and worked well. MY husband was happy! He had spare winders to fill! After a couple of months the red tint began to crumble, leaving purple poweder on white inner material. But we know how to use vacuum! After a year one winder does not function any more, another one turns on and off spontaneously.This year my beloved one is waiting for a new winder for his outgrown collection of watches. I would try a new brand!"
3,An opinionated and biased view of quilts....,"This book attempts to chronicle the history of quilts in America. Ms Bullard, however, misses her mark. Although she gives examples of early quilts as far back as 1840, she fails to identify the Civil War quilts and slave quilts used in the underground railroad. Her examples of Contemporary quilts are limited and myopic. She also freely expresses her dislike of certain types of quilts, which simply does not belong in a book like this. I was also surprised at the fact that quilt pictured on the dust jacket is not to be found in the book! The book has some very beautiful quilts however, and for the most part, the pictures are great. Some quilts however, are shown postage stamp size while the narrative is promptly displayed. I would have preferred larger pictures with smaller print! I do love looking through the book and would definitely recommend it."
3,fabulous quilts,"questionable text.even allowing for the copyright date (1992), the information is superficial and often less than accurate and suggests the author didn't bother with much research. i assume it was published to take advantage of the market for books on quilts, without considering that the target audience might actually be well-infromed on the subject.while the sections on older quilts contain some wonderful examples, the 'contemporary' is short and disappointing and gives no idea of the breadth of design at the date of publication.however, as the other reviewer points out, the pictures of the actual quilts are wonderful as inspiration and include examples you might not find in other books dealing with historical quilting."
2,Out of date info.,"This book is a decent overall book coving many of the basic wedding expectations and traditions. However, the author puts her opinions in on what she thinks is good and bad about the changing trends in weddings. If you don't want that, you can find a better book. Also, I found that some of the information is quite out of date (by nearly ten years on most info)."
5,SYLVIA'S FARM,WONDERFUL BOOK. DIDN'T WANT TO PUT THE BOOK DOWN.NEVER KNEW HOW COMPLICATED RAISING SHEEP WAS.
3,BEE NIGN THRILLER,"HELL SWARM is a little misleading to say the least. The promo for the film seems to focus on a batch of killer bees, laced with a deadly skin eating virus, that is meant to destroy mankind and let a race of aliens take over the earth. There is one bee attack, but it isn't shown; the plot mainly focuses on trying to stop these aliens from taking over other humans and procreating (a la INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS). Kathryn Morris (now seen on ""Cold Case"") does a decent job as the female law enforcer, but Tim Matheson as the steely manager and Boyd Kestner as the stalwart hero, don't have the oomph to catapult this classic wannabe.Trite but mildly entertaining."
5,Rebuttal to the previous review,"The earlier review is old. It was written in 1999. This book was updated in 2001. I found the book to be helpful, up-to-date and the most clear of all the CA divorce books.I highly recommend it -- forms change all the time, it is always important to check copyright dates on any book when using the forms. Plus check on-line resources to make sure the forms are accurate.The information and advice in this book is far superor than any of the other titles in the catagory."
4,Best of the Rahab tales,"Bremkamp does an excelent job of providing the historic social setting for Rahab. This book is NOT for kids; Rahab is not a cardboard saint, but a complex women whose character makes her choices believable in the real world... a genuinely artistic approach to this much told tale."
4,Good cd,this is a good cd the only problem with it is it is a half hour long If you want a goo halfbreed cd get one that is longer
3,Argent - 'Argent/Circus' (Wounded Bird),"A nicely assembled 2 lp's-on-one CD reissue.Of Argent's self-titled debut('69)and their 'Circus'('75)album.I had NO idea that Argent was putting out records that early.Decent '70's album rock,nothing outstanding,but okay.Never been that huge of an Argent fan anyway.Semi-memorable tracks include ""Dance In The Smoke"",Russ Ballard's ""Liar""(think a lot of us remember that tune on FM radio),""Stepping Stone"",""Highwire"" and ""The Jester"".Check it out when you can."
3,When there's nothing else to watch....,"Found this on Netflix and watched as I was lying in bed so I wasn't looking for Oscar material. The first 45 minutes or so were pretty good, but after that it got tedious. The lead character (can't remember her name even though I watched it last night) makes the usual horror/suspense stupid moves. Moving into the house where her father was murdered being the first. And then we have the obligatory pet-gets-murdered that you almost always know will happen. The 'ambiguous' ending (as another reviwer called it) annoyed me. But for a night when you're out of things to watch, it's ok."
2,how can this movie have 5 star review,This movie is a 3 at best and i am being kind. Insane plot and horrible characters. If someone is breaking into your home while you are there several times a week and the police wont stop them i might consider ... I dont know maybe shooting him 50 or 60 times in the head.the only decent part was the plot twist at the very end.
1,"Yes, we have established this is Rosewood Lane","Freaking 7 establishing shots, all of the same sign. And an additional 2 to Stillwater, in case no one knows what town she was approaching on her way home from work every night. Sorry, I lost my mind for a minute. Rose McGowan is Sonny, a radio shrink, who has to contend with a psychotic, nursery rhyme-spewing paperboy. Detective Briggs (Ray Wise) and his partner are particularly dense. Quite infuriating. A solid 8.5 on the Silly Meter."
2,Not among Salva's best.,"I wanted to like this movie, but it felt pointless. It had a few creepy moments, but in the end it just didn't make any sense. I won't give away the ending, but instead of being creeped out, I felt confused. The whole movie was full of characters who didn't matter, with moments that felt thrown in just because Salva didn't know what else to do. The movie has no focus whatsoever. I can't imagine Salva being overtly proud of this mess.The only thing I liked about the movie was the atmospheric neighborhood. I love that hill and the wonderful camera angles used to capture it. It reminds me of the neighborhood in which I grew up. That's about it, though."
2,I love Rose - Thats the reason I watched it but...,"Very slow in parts - like a ""Lifetime"" scary movie. But worst thing is, I didn't get it? Who was the kid? Why was he going bad things? Was he mad cause they didn't tip him as the paperboy? Or was he the paperboy? I thought the ending would tell the viewer more of the story but it only told us what I guessed in the middle of the movie... So I walked away thinking - what did I just watch?"
2,Not worth watching. . . . . . . .,I didn't like Rose McGowan as the main character - just didn't appear serious or old enough for the character. The ending is also quite stupid.
2,Couldn't Even Finish It,Watched the preview and it looked OK but after watching about 20 minutes I couldn't take it anymore and had to stop it even though I paid $4.99 for the rental. Just awful acting and script.
1,LIPS!!!!!!!,"It's kind of hard to take this movie seriously when you see puffed up, collagen injected, clown lips in every scene. In several scenes it even looks like she has trouble annunciating her words. Rose needs to chill out with the plastic procedures, she already looks like a junior cat-lady. It literally looks like she was punched in the mouth & the upper lip seems to be immobilized (botox), it never moves! The story itself might have been good, but I couldn't take looking at her face for more than a half hour, so I played Internet Scrabble while this movie was on in the background."
3,"Eh, Rose. Any other name",Could have been worse. ( some of it was) rapid crazy paper boy psycho. Menaces. Speeds away. But if you enj
1,Second worst movie ever!,"Just bad...very bad on all counts! Bad acting, bad plot, no character development, no horror or scare factor, truly this is all about Rose more concerned about how her plastic surgery looks on screen. F-"
1,False Adverisement,"This product used to be advertised as a spare UV bulb for pond clarifier, but it is really NOT an UV bulb. It costed me money and time. It is not economical for me to ship it back, and wish the supplier simply refund me the money without the product being returned but I doubt it since the supplier wants to make more money by false adverting the function of the product."
5,Great Shelf System,"I bought this shelf system off of Amazon a couple days ago. I am completly satisfied with it. It was easy to set up and i had it working in right after i opened it up. As for the sound, it is the best sounding mini-system I have heard, and I looked at a lot of them. I turned the speakers up almost all the way and they were not even distorting. The bass boost is awesome, it shook my floors when I had it half-way up. I would strongly recomend buying this system if you are looking for one, it is worth the extra money."
5,Wonderful.,"This is a little tank of a camera, with great optics and a decent optical & digital zoom combination, as well as awesome resolution. If you had to buy one digital camera for all needs, chances are you'd find the S40 a great hybrid of near-professional features and compact design. It does require a 2nd battery and a larger memory card to be ready to go, but aside from that, it's nearly perfect."
3,Things you want to know before you decide to buy Canon S40,"(1). There is 30 seconds length limit on each movie clip. When reach 30 seconds, the recording stop automatically!! I wouldn't have bought S40 if I knew this limit. Think about it, if you are recording a important event which last longer than 30 seconds, you are going to miss something you do not want to miss! To me, this is unacceptable.(2). After you start shooting movie, you can't zoom. This is unbelievable inconvenient.(3). Only AVI format for movie clip is available. I think mpeg format is better. File size will be smaller.(4). Amoung about 100 pics I took, I bearly remember any one that does not have red eye, even though I used red-eye reduction flash.(5). Distortion on the photo edge, as you see in all other small cameras.(6). My friend has a Sony digital camera, when it is connected to PC, you see the camera like a hard drive or CD. It is very easy to download/upload files. In S40, you can't do it this way."
2,Auto and movie modes has big problems,"I got it three weeks ago. I try it a lot. But I returned it back finally.Auto and Movie mode have big problems. Auto Focus seems not working right. Picture quality is not sharp. And movie is totally blurry and much worse than my brother's 2 MP canon one.Lens seems not clear, I guess there is dirt or moisture inside the lens.Very disappointed."
5,Built Like a Brick!,"This is a GREAT camera! Built VERY SOLID, easy to setup nice set of software and features. Get a good case for it, Canon didn't supply one (that bites). Took a ton of pics and all crystal clear! If you are thinking of this camera save up for a microDrive so you don't have to deal with storage issues. 16MB isn't enough for a 4MP camera.Brite Flash, fast and easy, bye bye my Film Camera, now I need a good ink Jet to print too!ONLY GRIPE!I didn't like that Amazon didn't sell it direct, it went thru J&R..;."
3,Wait For Canon PowerShot S45,"This is probably a decent camera, but in Europe, Canon recently introduced the PowerShot S45, which is significantly better. Information about the PowerShot S45 is on Canon's UK web site, and on Internet camera review sites."
4,ood stable camera,I like the fact that the camera uses compact flash. The compact flash cards come in sizes up to 4G so that is nice.Easy to use.
4,"Good camera, needs a couple of extras","I got this camera about seven months ago, and I've been very pleased with it. However, there are a couple of extras that are important to have in order to make it usable:1 - The included memory card is a bad joke. Plan on buying at least a 128, more likely a 256. You'll need it. (I bought a 128 at the same time that I got the camera, and I've found that it's not enough. The 256 that I picked up a few months later seems about right.)2 - BUY AN EXTRA BATTERY, and carry it with you. My single complaint with this camera is the expensive proprietary battery. Expensive as it is, though, an extra battery is indispensable if you're going to use the camera much.3 - Particularly for low-light shots and no-flash shots, get a tripod. (That's going to be my next purchase.) My hands are good and steady, but not steady enough for this camera."
4,"I would have given this 5 stars, I absolutely LOVED this book!","The only thing that really bugged me was the 'guest' chapters, where the author pulled some stories from his website that were submitted by others. I found the two stories to be utterly boring, tedious to read and just NOT FUNNY. They were a sharp contrast to the authors book however, the stories (especially the Walmart revenge story) all made me pee my pants I was laughing so hard! I love his writing style, and even if all the stuff that happens isn't totally true (if it IS true, this guy would be a riot to hang out with), he really is a comic genius!If he does write any more books, I offer my editing services for free, as there were some typos that could have been avoided with some proofreading.Except for the guest chapters, this book will make you pee your pants, you will be laughing so hard! I must say that my sense of humor runs the gamut from crap jokes to Calvin and Hobbes, to Married with Children."
1,HORRIBLE,"Thankfully I tried the free sample pages on my Kindle before I spent money on this. This book is not even worth the 80 cents. The profane language used in this book is terrible. There was nothing funny at all. Anyone who thinks it's funny to show porn on televisions at Walmart where it can be seen by children is a sick, warped, individual. As the mother of a special needs child I was completely appalled at the authors insensitive and derogatory use of language like ""retard"" and ""having a third chromosome"". This book is nothing but garbage."
4,Not bad at all,"I missed almost the whole season of Survivor but managed to catch the last 3 episodes on TV. It was then that I knew how much I had missed.This DVD isn't bad. While it is impossible to squeeze what happened in a whole season into one DVD, it told enough. I knew who I liked and who I didn't from watching it. Since I didn't watch most of the series on TV, I really cannot tell what were the new scenes and what was not. However, I can say that if you watched the series and you want a recap then buy it! It's not too expensive and the disk itself pays itself back just to be able to watch the Survivors' homemade tapes. Especially Sue's! She was nasty in the end but at least her tape was funny.All we need now is the boxed set of the whole season..."
1,Disappointment,"What a waste of time. As an avid fan of Survivor I felt that the money spent was not worth it.This was boring, boring, boring and there was no excitement whats so ever and good have gone to a fine resturant for the money spent on this garbage. :("
1,This DVD really sucks even thow im a big survivor foan,this dvd really sucked becuse there wernt any chalanges and they showed all the votes and when he was reding the votes they skiped to the last vote plus somany intervuies with the castaways. I hope the Complete first season has challanges and all that kind of stuff.
1,Enough Already!,"Some people just don't want to let their 15 minutes of fame end. This show is an example of how low people's expectations have sunk in regards to television. Why any intelligent human being in his right mind would BUY this tape or DVD is perplexing.What new ""insights"" about the show could one possibly derive from this item? It only makes me wish that they had placed Burmese tiger traps, anti-personnel mines and cobras on that island.If you have no life and watching the filmed exploits of a bunch of attention-starved, back-stabbing, bumbling nitwits is your idea of a good time, then this tape is for you."
3,Not impressive,"Being a survivor junkie I was hoping to enjoy this one. I didn't. This seems to be a few highlights from the first season, yes, all of Susan's dialogue is in there, and so is Rudy's not liking Richard in a homosexual way, but it doesn't have a lot of substance. It is highlights from each episode, but there isn't a whole lot that you haven't seen before. Some is uncensored dialogue, but you don't see much of many of the cast members. You do see a lot of the final four, others are in there as well, but they don't get the features that those four do. Personally I'd rent this one but I wouldn't purchase it."
2,A HUGE letdown.,"I am a big Survivor fan. (Yes, I've been sucked in by the hype.) I was very excited about this DVD. But it is boring and uneventful. I wanted to see some dirt... arguments, hook-ups, etc., the kinds of things that might get censored from network television. You get way more out of watching the TV show that you do on this whole DVD. I don't recommend it at all."
2,Was Hoping For Better,"The title of the video led me to think that it would be clips of scenes that didn't make or couldn't be shown on national TV but, with few exceptions, it was basically nothing more than highlights of the TV program itself. To avoid nausea, fast-forward through the scenes with Susan in it."
1,Give Us the Box Set...Not This Disappointing CD,"CBS and Jeff Probst turned ""Survivor"" and ""Survivor II: The Outback"" into a rating's meg-a-hit. This DVD does just the opposite. It sheds no light on what made ""Survivor"" a huge hit or why people tuned in every week. I say, ""Put the whole series on VHS or DVD."" This 2 hour plus rehash is a complete washout."
4,Some of What You Don't See.,"This video takes a look at some of the best scenes from the first edition of SURVIVOR. If you watched the first show, then there isn't much here that you haven't seen before. However, there are audition tapes for each of the contestants as well as more lengthy parting words by each Survivor after they recieved the boot. There is a little profanity heard from B.B. and Sue that was edited out of the televised episodes and you do get a few clear pictures of Richard Hatch's .....butt. That's about it. The tribe has spoken."
4,Underrated,"I recently purchased this DVD (although I was almost put off by some bad reviews) and believe it has recieved a bad rap and is underrated. Granted, with some more footage of challenges and the rewards that were won it could have been better, but the interview with Mark Burnett and Jeff Probst (the highlight of the DVD for me) more than make up for the shortcomings in that area. So, for anyone who claims to be a true fan of Survivor (as some previous reviews have stated, it's not really for first time viewers of the show) it is a must have."
3,"Pretty Good, but a little short",The best parts are the database and the interviews with Mark Burnett and Jeff Probst. They left out all the challenges except the quick clips they showed in various places and the short segment montage of clips in the middle of the DVD. They do have all the audition tapes however. I'd like to see the whole Survivor: Pulau Tiga and Survivor: Australian Outback released on DVD.
2,Survivor - Season One Review,I bought this DVD based on promotions that it contained lots of footage not aired on television. I was disappointed to find that the only real footage not shown on television was more of Richard Hatch naked and of Jenna digging a pit for the survivor's outhouse. In fact the DVD doesn't even contain full footage of the weekly episodes that aired on CBS. All of the episodes contained on the DVD are abbreviated. Save your money!
1,Very little we haven't seen before...,"This DVD is 2 hours and 6 minutes long. Only about 6 minutes of this is NEW or UNSEEN material, and most of the UNSEEN material is Richard's bare buttocks. Everything else is just a rehash of the TV show. I rented it before deciding if I wanted to buy it, whew, close call!"
3,Not what I expected,"As a survivor fan I did enjoy this DVD, but, I was loking for the series, not outtakes. I found it very interesting. There is a glitch on the one I bought tho. About halfway through it gets wobbly and pauses for a couple of minutes. This happens again a little later then stops"
2,I wanted to like this book!,"I love all of the British ""chick lit,"" and I was prepared to love this book too, but I just didn't. I found Will's situtation to be pretty pathetic--his girlfriend dumped him three years ago, and he still isn't over it yet. He lives in a hovel decorated only with a photo of said ex-girlfriend. He seems to hate his job. And he does exceptionally foolish things, like deciding that he's meant to spend his life with Kate, a girl he has only spoken to on the phone.I found this story tedious, and basically only finished it because it wasn't THAT bad, and because I'd already devoted some time to it..."
3,Chick lit with a male protagonist,"I chose this book based on its pretty cover. Here's a good piece of advice: Never judge a book by its cover...bad or good.That's all this book had---a cute cover.I was hopeful that this book, with its male protagonist, a first for me in chick lit, would be clever and new. Nope.Disappointing waste of good reading time."
1,"horrible, horrible, horrible",One day I decided I needed to read every type of book out there. I usually ready fantasy novels. I wanted to know if I'd be interested in other books besides fantasy. I picked up a horror novel and it was slightly entertaining. Started to read a historical fiction novel but never finished. Then I picked up this up. I read the whole thing and decided never again to read a romance novel. This guy I forget his name now but he was so pathetic and weird. He wants to marry some girl from the telephone...stupid! But what pissed me off was the ending! DUMB!
4,Beach Reading From Britain,"Amusing beach/airplane reading, best described as a male Bridget Jones's Diary meets something attempting to be Nick Hornbyish. The book covers the birthday weekend of Will, a twentysomething high school teacher new to London as he contemplates his crappy flat, crappy diet, and obsession with his ex-girlfriend. The story hinges around his ex, who he has idealized as a fabulous creature who waltzed out of his life two years previously. In the course of this weekend, there are numerous phone calls: his [bad] mate Simon, his best friend Alice, his one-night stand Martina, Kate (the previous occupant of his flat), and inevitably his ex. It's entirely predictable--in fact you can probably figure out what happens just by reading the above--but still reasonably fun, if not particularly deep."
2,"Slow, very slow","This book by Mike Gayle was definitely a disappointment. Mr. Commitment was such an awesome book that I was sure Gayle had something great in store for his next novel, but he did not. My Legendary Girlfriend is a very slow read that is rather disturbing at points and sometimes just really boring. The last chapters or so pick up a bit, but still nothing wonderful. I would suggest getting the book from the library if you are interested, but I wouldn't buy it."
3,"Not his best, but it's still worth the time","By the end of this book, I was ready to slap the book's main character, Will. The story revolves around Will's inability to get over his ""legendary girlfriend,"" Aggi, and his reluctance to move on with his life. The pace is slow, and there's much self-loathing. The real action takes place at the end of the novel when Will decides to take control of his life and to get over Aggi. But, I'm afraid that this comes a little too late. The characters become muddled and the action gets a little too unreal for my tastes. There are some interesting characters in the book- Kate, Alice, and Simon- but we don't learn much about them due to Will's self-centeredness. Maybe this is the point, but I just would have liked to have seen more of these peripheral characters since they impact Will's moods and actions so much. This is not my favorite Mike Gayle, but it still makes for a nice summer read."
2,Ugh...,"While I only am a little over half way through this book, I'm finding myself hating Will. He's pathetic and boring and not at all a character that I can cheer for. This book has been a tedious read overall. I keep pushing through because I feel like it has to get better, yet so far it has not. I'm happy that I checked this out from the library, so that I can return it and not have it collect dust on MY shelves. The only reason why I'm even writing a review is that I'm so shocked about all the positive comments this book has received thus far. I looked on Amazon to see if my thoughts were shared by others; I'm surprised that they are not. I usually like this genre of fiction, but in terms of this book all it is is a bunch of whining and self-loathing."
1,no good,"I bought this book because I read one of his other books when I was a kid. ""Till the Rafters Ring"" was a very funny book. He should have stopped there."
2,"No chapter, very expensive for what it is","I was very dissapointed in this DVD.I purchased the Stamina reformer and needed DVDs to go with it.- There's no chapter and a long introduction. I normally start the DVD before I get dressed and get the performer ready. When I'm ready, I still have to fast-forward to find the beginning of the work-out. For $29.00, I expected an interactive DVD, at least some chapters!- the exercises are virtually the same that came with the free DVD included with the Performer I purchased! (Level 1), so if you already have Level 1, you are wasting $29.00- the DVD is short, I expected more variations and more exercises.- the teacher is good but nothing spectacular. I was hoping for more explanation of what each exercise did for my body.Bottom line: if you already have other Stamina Pilates DVDs, same your money."
1,Wow.. is there a negative star?,"This movie sucked.. I should have read the first review before buying it.The CGI was about a 7, the story line was a -1Stupid story and cgi was slow and out of sync with with the dub."
1,wayyy too short....?,not Worth soo much money for only 47 min.....? Thats when the credits startet rolling....? Guess I did not looked at the running Time when buying it.....? I might return it too Expensive 34.00$ for only 47 min....?
3,Standard Mecha Anime That's It,"The major problem isn't that it's a bad movie story plot it's that there really isn't a story plot. Like with some of the other reviewers have said the story concept is both pretty generic and bland a basic plot of unknown enemies invade the earth and now after some years the people of earth feel now it's the time to possibly strike back. Also we have a pretty generic background story for the main male character that has been seen on hundreds of other animes out there with nothing to really separate his character from the others we've seen before. The CGI animation was decent, while not the greatest it wasn't awful and the voice cast for the dubbed and subbed did a pretty terrific job for their character roles. Don't get this expecting anything really original in plot or characters this is mostly a nice add on for the mecha anime fans more then anything else."
1,Westlife: Live at Wembley,Not realizing I ordered the PAL Format I could not play this DVD on my player. Had to send back and order one in the DVD format. Loved the DVD once it would play. Was on time as always and in great condition. Love Amazon!
5,They're my Irish Toy Boys...,I was a total bum on New Year's Eve & sat in front of the Goggle Box_and watched Westlife Live At Wembley. It was fantastic! Definitely worth purchasing. You will enjoy totally it.
1,Westlife: Live at Wembley,"I am not sure why this DVD is for sale in the U.S., because it is not in a format that can be watched in this country! I was forced to return the DVD for a refund, and I was not happy."
1,Not happy,I purchased this item for my niece for her birthday and come to find out it will not work in any DVD player that her or I own. It would have been nice to know that it is not compatible with the DVD players here in the US. But if someone knows how to get it to work please let me know otherwise I just wasted $25.
2,jwin jx-r26 voice actived recorder,good enuf to do what I need to do.Took awhile to get product. Satisfied
1,This thing is useless...,"I love Chicago Metallic's deep dish pans. They're great and do their job well. The pan grippers are useless if you make anything like a real deep-dish or stuffed pizza (My wife and I prefer stuffed). It should be noted that I fill that pan with two crusts and a LOT of toppings, sauce, and cheese. When all is said and done, the middle of the pie will top the edges, so it's a very heavy pizza. This gripper just can't handle it. It's made of stamped metal, not forged, and will bend and give and your pie winds up on the floor. DON'T buy this, unless you're making nothing bigger than a 99-cent frozen pie."
1,No Firm Grip on Pizza Pan,"We went to use this with our new pizza pan and when my husband used the grippers, did not hold the pan and consequently we then had ""floor pizza"" and had to order take out!! If you do use it, make sure you have a mitten to grab the pan as it falls to the floor!"
2,Songs,"This Cd has mostly christian songs and we are jewish. Little disappointed that CD had so many religious songs. I signed up for fun children's songs, not children's songs with christian twist. Wish the description would have been clearer!"
3,100 Singalong songs for kids,My grand child likes the songs. BUT SOME OF THE SONGS ARE TOO RELIGIOUS.100 Singalong Songs for Kids [Box Set] Cedarmont Kids | Format: Audio Cd
2,"great songs, but too religiously oriented","If you're looking for a comprehensive kids song cd, this is it. However, beware that many of the songs use lyrics that are very Christian oriented (example: if you're happy and you know it, say Amen). Turns out the group that recorded this is according to their website ""the #1 selling Christian Children's music in the world"". This was not stated clearly in the product description. If that doesn't bother you, then go for it. For someone who is looking to keep religious references out of songs for children that should be benign to start with, look somewhere else. I was disappointed by this purchase and ended up returning it."
1,Don't order from Champagne Shelly,"I ordered a CD on Nov. 28, 2010. It was never sent to me. I wrote to Champagne Shelly, but she never wrote back. I have written her again requesting the order be canceled. I will never order from this company again."
1,A little repetitive and religious,"This is not a secular collection; there are multiple Christian songs. No Jewish jams. No Buddhist beats. No Muslim melodies. They should advertise this as a Christian collection. Not doing so is a little dishonest, IMHO.The songs are a little repetitive--they all sound somewhat similar. There are a couple of good ones though, so you can always make a play list."
1,misleading-lots of christian songs,It should be advertised as a religious compilation even though there are popular non religious songs squeezed in between. I felt this was deceptive and misleading.
3,"Nice selection of songs, kind of annoying","Lots of songs and a good selection. Some of the songs are a little odd or maybe I have just never heard of them. I ended up loading the CD onto iTunes, making a playlist of my favorites, and then burning that onto a CD. So I do not use all 100 songs, but get good use out of maybe 20 of them. My preschool class likes the songs: Clap Your Hands, The Eensy Weensy Spider, Roll Over, Six Little ducks, The Wheels on the Bus, Skinna Marinky Dinky Dink, Row Row Row Your Boat, Head Shoulders Knees and Toes, If Your Happy and You Know It, The Ants Go Marching, Bingo, and Old MacDonald. Even though I only use those songs from the CD collection, my students really love those songs listed above, so it is worth it if you can get it for a good price and are willing to put in the time to find the good songs and consolidate them."
2,Should be listed as religious,"The songs are fun and my 4 year old enjoys them, but there is a religious theme throughout that was not advertised."
4,100 Singalong songs for kids,"Works wonders on our son. Came in handy everytime we have a play date, especially during his first bday party. Thanks to this wide selection of songs, we got to sing along with the ones we knew whilst discovering and learning new ones."
3,"Okay for the Price, Not Great","I bought this box set for a lot of the songs that we wanted to teach our children. It's been a mixed bag for us, and isn't one of our favorites by any stretch.Pro's- It's cheap, so you get a lot of music for your $- There are some obscure songs that are hard to find elsewhereCon's- Some of the songs are abbreviated or shortened- Quite a few Christian songs, which we were able to filter when we moved them to our MP3 player- The pace of the songs is pretty quick, so I don't really think it is ideal for singalongsIf you are a Christian household, this would be a pretty good buy, but I would not purchase again."
3,"Great songs, but they all sound the same","I read the reviews before purchasing this compilation and I agree that these are great songs (there are 100 of them after all) but after a while, they all seem to sound the same. They are sung by a children's choir and while these children sound phenomenal, all the songs they sing sound alike. I like my children's songs to have wacky words with special emphasis on different sounds. With a choir, they can't do that. They are melodic but monotone. Young children don't sound like that and my daughter would rather hear some fun songs (or at least I would.) I'd recommend this for pretty music, but not for FUN music."
5,Fun...,"The second that I put this in the player, my daughter (2 yrs) loved it. The songs are upbeat and she loves to listen to her music in the mornings. She sings along with those she knows and is quickly learning the others. We enjoy playing and clapping and laughing to the music..."
5,What a great deal! My son loves these CD's!!!,"I was looking for a cd with a handful of nursery rhymes that my son loved to sing. These CD's had all of them and then some. What I love about it is that with normal kids cd's, there are about 10 songs. The little ones love listening to music and tend to want you to play the same music over and over until you're so sick of them, they ""accidently"" end up in the trash. Just like the title says, 100 sing-a-longs has so many songs, you don't really get sick of listening. And those little singing voices are so cute. Also, I like that in addition to all of the classic nursery rhymes that kids love, they also throw in classic biblical tunes. Keeps the cd ""cute"" and ""wholesome"". Seriously, for $7, how can you not buy it?"
3,Not exactly what I expected,"The selection of songs in these CDs is nice but I didn't notice when ordering it that it was a Christian CD with lots of religious songs, Some of the classics are even changed to a religious version (""If you're happy and you know it shout Amen"").I'm not saying it's a bad thing.I just wanted to point it out because it is not that pointed out in the description. I'm Jewish and would not buy this CD had I known."
5,PERFECT FOR MY 4 Y/O GRANDDAUGHTER,"I purchased a karaoke machine for my granddaughters, 4 and 7, for Christmas. The 4 y/o cannot read yet so I purchased these CDs for her to use her microphone and sing along. She knows many of the songs and there are many new ones she can learn. Incredible amount of songs for the price. The 7 y/o sings along with these too. Very pleased and would definitely recommend."
2,Christian music,"Whoops. I somehow missed that this is a collection that includes a bunch of religious songs, along with a bunch of old classics."
2,"Nice collection, but beware of religious bent","I agree with NYlady: this collection is nice overall but they not only include religious songs (and also pro-U.S. songs that may offend some parents) but also modify the lyrics of some traditional songs to include religious themes. I would have given this one star but most of the tracks are well produced, hence two stars. If you're a Christian true to your faith and not act like John Edwards, this would be a five-star CD set for you. The price can't be beat."
3,Too churchy.,"Over all the CD's are ok, I didn't realize that a lot of the songs are religious songs, but that is my fault because I didn't look at the song names before buying it."
4,Very cute and alot of songs.,I bought this for my 4 year old who loves to sing and dance. These songs are great and easy for her to remember the words to. There are 3 cds and every song you can think of. Very cute and I would recommend it to anyone with a child that loves to sing along.
4,Great Value,"A lot of songs in this collection. Many bring back memories. My 2 yr old granddaughter loves and dances around the room to them. Many of the songs are short enough for her not to lose interest.If you want to sing some of the classics with your child or grandchild, this is a good value with a huge selection of songs. The ants go marching 1 by 1, hurah, hurah..."
5,Great Music CD,"I have 21 month old son, 3 year old daughter and 4 year old daughter, and they all love these. Personally I love arrangement of the song, too. I guarantee the quality of these CDs as a musician majored music composition in college."
5,Super,The 3 disc children's songs are super. The songs have been carefully selected and the music is great. I recommend this collection for any child.
2,Not singalong at all,"I was looking for some songs that I could sing with my little child, but this choir type songs are not fun at all. Besides that, the songs are short and go too fast. I think I won't listen to them again after the first time, too boring for me. Of course the people who like choirs could like it."
2,Christian Kids Songs,"I bought this CD for my son without looking closely at all the songs on the disc. Unfortunately, this is a compilation of Christian kids' songs, and we are not of the Christian faith. If you are, then you will probably really enjoy this CD, but if you are of another faith, you should keep looking for a disc with non-religious songs."
5,Cedarmont Kids,"Another order for my granddaughter, she loves all the Cedarmont DVDs. Now my new granddaughter will enjoy them also. Both the girls loves to sing and dance."
4,My two-year-old loves it!,"My two year old cried one day when I tried to turn it off. the music is well done and there are actual kids singing, which i like. The only problem is that I get a little sick of it after a while. These songs are the classics that have been around forever. I like that for my son, but I have heard them too many times. I have to hide his CD if I want to listen to my own music and avoid a hassle. But hey, that means the CD is good, right? Since when have parents and children ever agreed on music?"
3,Hidden agenda,"Many enjoyable songs.....BUT.....seems as if every third song has a religious theme. If I had wanted a Christian songbook, I would have bought one. I just wanted some happy childhood songs to share with my grandchildren. I would have liked to have seen/heard a more accurate description!!!"
4,Songs for a new baby,"The songs are sung clearly by (I suppose) kids. A lot of them took me back to my childhood.As noted in the description, there are a combination of both secular and religious classic songs."
1,screen patio door,waste of money did not work and tool was very poorly made rope was wrong size. Would not recommend it for others
4,Extremely helpful and well thought out,"I'm a high school teacher who took an interest in portfolio creation. Unfortunately, much of the work within this field concerns elementary and middle school levels with very little to no focus on the upper grade levels. This book however, provides a excellent stepping stone for anyone considering portfolios for use in their classroom. I now intend to use two of the various types of portfolios in my social studies class - the knowledge portfolio consisting of the student's work throughout the school year and secondly an achievement portfolio containing a collection of the student's ""best"" work (e.g. 10). If a 4 1/2 were possible this is a more accurate grade. The only thing I wished it had were more suggestions for products to use throughout the school year."
4,Organized plan for portfolio development,"This book was helpful in creating a portfolio for one of my EdS classes. It's well organized and clear. It's very dry, but how interesting can portfolio construction be? It's worth your money if you are required to do portfolio assessments."
3,Don't pay more than $35!,"I was scrolling through amazon's reccomendations for me & I saw this pop up & could not believe my eyes!!!! $[...]!!! This toy is NOT worth more than $[...]!! We've owned this toy for over 2 years. It is PLASTIC, does not light up, talk to you, move on it's own or anything else. The tiny pieces are easily lost & it's hard to close. Do not waste your money. If you have to have it, buy it after Christmas & give as a birthday present."
4,Amazon to the rescue!,"The little mermaid pop-up castle was sold out everywhere this past holiday season selling at $34.99. I found it on Amazon for $26.47 and free shipping!My daugher, 3 yrs old, just loves it. The accessories are very tiny, like the tea pot and tea cups. Tiny like your pinky fingernail.We all love it! Easy to put together, but I think it folds up, I don't know how though."
5,My child loves this toy!!!!,This toy is so neat! It's wonderful to take places because it folds all up into it's own case when you're done playing with it. The only bad thing is that it's kind of hard to fit all the accessories in when the case is being closed. I always have to help my little one with this...other wise I would highly recommed this to anyone!
3,Princess Ariel,This castle has a neat storage box that everything folds into!!! It was a little expensive for what you get. It has very small parts.
3,Slightly disappointed,"I actually requested this toy for my daughters 3rd birthday ,She loves it!, I knew she would- I thought I would too.But what a mess!NOT all the accessories can be stored inside."
3,This is ok,My daughter wanted this but for her age I think it is for someone younger then what she is. She really dosent play with it much.
3,Good toy for a Little Mermaid fan,"If your child loves Little Mermaid, then she will probably like the Castle Playset. Otherwise, it's just a flimsy little dollhouse. It's worth about $35 max, in my opinion. I had to exchange the first set I bought because it wouldn't stay latched shut. The plastic is thin and it was a little warped. Don't count on a three or four year old being able to get it set up and folded back down herself. I'm not sorry I bought it, but I only paid $30."
3,Very little pieces,"Although my daughter was excited to receive this present, when I opened it and saw all of the very little pieces that were included, I was not so thrilled. The case is somewhat hard to close and even harder to keep closed. The pieces do not really fit inside (if you want to close it that is). My daughter does like the Ariel and Prince Eric doll that came with it and she plays with them in the tub. I would probably skip this gift if you have little ones to worry about putting things in their mouth."
5,Overall,"Hey, If you ever had a gamecube game such as Phantasy Star Online, or some other gamecube game with internet play, the Gamecube Broadband Adapter is the best way to go. After I got mine, just plugged it into the router and everything was working fine."
5,Not a Game >.>,"This is not a video game, I don't know why Amazon put it like this. But the product arrived faster then another item that was still being shipped from a week ago. Very good service, good packaging as well."
3,Table Sketches,"While I am a big fan of Charles Burns, his art loses some of its effectiveness in the absence of a storyline. Sure, there are the usual deformed creatures, but gone are the themes of lost innocence and childhood confusion over sex and parental morals that add to the creepiness of his illustrations. The drawings are enjoyable, but for the most part they appear to have been quickly sketched on napkins while awaiting dinner in a dark restaurant. This is for diehard fans only."
4,Very good value,"This drill press table is a really good value.Installation is simple and quick. The mechanism to attach the table to the drill will fit most drill press. I used it first on a small delta benchtop drill press and now on a full size powermatic.It took me a while to decide which table to buy, I almost built it myself. After pricing the project and shopping around I decided to buy this model. I was a little skepticle on my decision at first because I couldn't undesrtand why this model was at least a quarter of the price of any other product I could find and at least half the price of anything I could have done on my own. Well after using it for a while, I must say this is product has been a very welcome surprise.I only have one complaint. I whish that the rail to hold the stop was made with a t-Track and not routed in the MDF directly. I know that eventually it will fail.But for the price, not much to complain."
2,Made a pretty nice template,"This item is made out of some sort of pressed paper and not wood. So, when you tighten any of the screws or bolts you end up stripping the screw out. However, it is a nice design and I used it as a template (and scavenged some of its parts) to build my own out of some scrap lumber I had laying around. Pretty expensive as a template and not really worth it otherwise."
1,Ok for the price,I agree with another reviewer.The quality of the product was lacking. Mine also had a burr or something on the holddown bolt. The clamps don't quite fit my drill press but it works fine for the price.Edit: It's junk. Mine basically fell apart after little use. Would not purchase again.
2,Cheap material,"If you like an MDF table with plastic laminated sides & edges you can buy it, but if you wish something stronger spend a few more dollars"
3,I expected more from Arendt,"Though Arendt is one of my favorite political theorists, this compilation left me dissapointed. Though her insights on Truth, Justice and Authority are well argued, she makes very few of the observations that made me love her works. The best chapter in the book is the 7th, a defense of her work Eichmann in Jeruselum (though she does not explicitly mention it) where she discusses the nature of Truth and its role it the telling of history. As usual of course, a knowledge of Greek and Latin is helpful with Arendt (which I don't have) as the text is full of foreign words."
3,Missing a page,I did like this book when I got it for my nephew for christmas. It was exactly what he wanted. The only negative is that when he opened his gift he noticed one page was missing(page 8 or 9) It was the cardinal I believe. By then it was to late for me to return the book for another. So make sure you look to see you have all of the pages in the book...
3,Waiting for the Latin Album on CD,"Many of us fans from the 60's would like a CD of the Latin Album. Current CD releases don't seem to include the song ""Reloj""."
4,A good book for all Christian fellow's even non Christian,"Well...Generally this book is for Christian people whom belief in God as we can see there are lots of quote from the bible, also some teaching of better understanding of women want's...!!As better understanding for man while also possible for women also......!! I personally do like this book while as a man i would like to better understanding of my lover, or shall be call life partners. What does she want? like ? or dislike...and so on.Actually, as a Christain here we shall know that sex before marriage is not good while as a single christian we also can learn what is the God arranged or given to us....especially between husband and wife....teaching each of us what is the philosophy thinking of it.I given a 4 star here while it is a good book with a good plain and easy understading of reading, a fun and easy book to read and learn!!!"
4,"Publisher's Weekly was right - Great Book, Horrible Audio","This may be a brilliant and insightful book, but as an audio CD it is impossible to listen to. I wish I had paid attention to the PW review, because it is all too apt. (""The Canadian author's bizarre, somewhat hypnotic reading style--with its randomly elongated vowels--is a cross between Dustin Hoffman's Rain Man character and a classic Yiddish whine."") Imagine what it would sound like if English were chanted like a Hebrew prayer by a computer generated voice . I still plan to read this highly praised book, but for me the audio version has been a complete disaster. I have given up on it."
5,"Wonderful, wonderful stuff","First off, the content: Michael Wex's survey of all things Yiddish is totally fascinating -- funny, scholarly, full of odd and interesting historical nuggets about language and society and the Jewish people. As for the reading style - well, different strokes for different folks, I think. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I found it rather entrancing, to be honest - though I can certainly understand those who disliked it (even those who disliked it intensely), I was not among them. Thoroughly enjoyable."
1,Bummer,"Customer service rude and of little help. TV failed 10 days out of 1 yearwarranty, I have another identical unit that is starting to act like it to is failing."
1,Toshiba Regza is a bad choice!,"My Toshiba Regza 32HL67U had the screen go dark just after the warranty period. The inverter board failed. No one sells the board alone. Toshiba service is a joke! The inverter is integral to the LCD screen and it would cost up to two times the cost of the new unit to replace. I will never buy another Toshiba and I am a true believer in ""word of mouth"" advertising._Johann"
1,Very Disappointing Quality - stay away from this one!,"After 6 months the power supply failed and the TV will not power up normally. If you hold the power button in for 1 minute it may 'reset' and power up, but not always. So, I have a TV that works only when it wants to. It does have a nice picture, but that's not exactly useful if it doesn't power on. I am currently working with Toshiba to get it fixed under warranty. I have seen this complaint from other customers, so it does not appear to be an unusal problem. I would guess there is a systematic quality/design issue with the power supply."
5,Very good HDTV,Have had this in place for about a week. Delivered no problems. It's running with a Toshiba HD-A3 HD DVD player and a Comcast Motorola 6200 HD STB. Both produce fabulous imagery ... and the sound is fine (it's only a bedroom TV set after all). No banding at all. No dead pixels. Perfect. I'd buy it again.
5,Very Good TV,"I've had this TV for about 2 Months now. The Picture Quality is excellent and the TV looks really good too. For the Price (around $700) i think this is of great value..good quality at a reasonable priceIt take a few seconds to power On, but this is not a big issue for me.(I also have a 42"" samsung which powers on faster)"
4,2 years together,"It's been two years and I still love my tv. At the time I researched the heck out of tv's and this was ""the one"". So glad I got this one."
4,Quality Set,Overall i must say that im very pleased with this set. I have compared it to other LCD televisions and found that it is easy to set up and its picture is equal to much more expensive sets.
1,Arrived Defective,Our new Toshiba HDTV arrived defective. We were able to get it to turn on only 2 out of the first 50 times. We called the Toshiba tech. dept. and the procedures they ran us through were unsuccessful. They told me I'd have to call their regional service center which I did. They were nearly 2 hours from our remote location and said we'd have to bring it in for repair. We're returning the TV and a new one is on the way.
1,Screen black,"Like so many others, I got 2 years out of mine. The picture is totally black, and only have sound.Do not buy a Toshiba. Shame on them for not admitting there is a problem and doing something for their customers.NEVER AGAIN!"
4,great tv,"Picture looks great, only complaint I have is the sound at times is a little funny and it takes a while to turn on. Other than that it's definitely worth the money"
2,Was great until it broke,"Worked well for 3 months, then the screen went blank. Getting Toshiba to honor their warranty has been tricky, and is still ongoing. Will check back with further info as the situation unfolds.Edit #1: Follow up. Toshiba has been helpful in at least getting me to a repair center. The TV will probably be there 3 weeks or so. I expected as much. The power board is probably the issue, so says the repairman and this has been a problem with the Toshiba's for some time now with no improvements in the newer models. As always, I keep this updated. Specifically, there better not be ANY charges to get this thing fixed.Edit #2: Follow up. Toshiba replaced it with a newer model. Great customer service for a bad product. The newer model works fantastic."
5,It's been a year,I've had this TV for a year now and it's outstanding. The picture is great and absolutely no problem. It was child's play to attach my Bose speaker and second DVD player.Delivery and setup was also outstanding.
4,great buy for the price,"I really wanted a new LCD TV but didn't want to pay the high label prices with brands like Sony. I read many reviews about Toshiba's HDTVs and found this to be quite practical. The color contrast and size were really good for how much I paid. I'm so happy LCDs are no longer in the thousands of dollars, because the difference it makes is INCREDIBLE.I'd recommend the Regza to anyone."
1,Great for 1 year and 2 months,"This was a great TV for 1 year and 2 months (convienient for Toshiba that my warranty expired), but then one day I tried to turn it on and got sound but no picture. I took it to a repairman to hear that I was out of luck and that he has had a lot of the same problems with Toshiba (the panels going out). So if you want a TV for long enough for your warranty to expire then this is the TV for you. By the way customer service sucks and all they recommened was that I unplug the TV for 3 minutes and try it again...Don't buy this TV or any other Toshiba you will waste your money!"
4,Great TV,"Pros:-Great Picture. Sharp and clear with nice colors. It even does a good job with 480i signals.-Signal meter. Adjusting an antenna when watching a digital station can be difficult. This makes it easier.-Pretty good sound.-QAM tuner so you can dump the cable box.Cons:-No Guide feature. This is just plain stupid. Even the really cheap, off brand, LCD TVs have a guide feature.-Remote is not great. Also it is really poor as a universal remote; it is very limited in what it can control.-Lousy PC monitor. It can display 1024x768, 800x600, and 640zx480 and nothing else. It can't even display start up info when you first turn on the computer because that is in text mode. Worst of all, it can't do a 1366x768 display which is the native resolution of the screen and would be the best choice.Overall, this is a great TV for the money. The picture is great, I can live with the rest."
4,Great TV - Lousy delivery,Great TV - lousy delivery. UPS made it almost impossible to take delivery requiring in person signature and never coming when they said they would - I was home for 2 consecutive days and my wife took a half day off to no avail. It was finally delivered 10 days after it arrived in the 'local' office which was 40 miles away.
5,Hard to beat for the money!,"I ordered this a little over a week before ""black friday"" and kept checking the ad scans for black friday to see if this set would be offered somewhere else cheaper. Way to go Amazon, nobody beat you on the price and the TV was delivered about 10 Am on black friday itself. I am very happy with the quality. Picture is great for SD signal from DirectTV and regular DVD player looks fine. I can only imagine how much better this would look with a HD signal or DVD. Less than two weeks with the product but so far I am 100% happy with both Toshiba and Amazon."
1,Toshiba garbage,"Gave this as a gift. Finally, recipient confessed that unit failed and has been waiting for repair for over 3 months. Unit is at authorized service center since. Toshiba knows that some part is deficient but never made recall. Keep away. It works for a bit and then fails and their after market support is the worst. Why take a chance? As a gift it was an embarrassment. Instead of giving something to enjoy, it resulted in an unimaginable problem for the recipients to take care of. Toshiba could not care less even though they know the specific component is a problem.Go SONY or something else."
5,Great TV,"I've had this tv for a few months no. The picture in HD is incredible.The sound I felt was better then Sharp's similar model. My only complaint would be the remote lacks enough codes to run some other devices. I would recommend getting an HDMI cable (not included) and HD service, the picture clarity is amazing. The set is very attractive and doesn't take up much space. Overall a great product and good buy so far.Amazon white glove delivery was spotty, they mixed up the delivery date but the delivery person was really helpful."
4,Overall very solid purchase,"This TV was my first HDTV and I'm really really happy with it. Mounted on my wall, it just made my living room practically double in size. My only complaint is that I cannot figure out a way to fully optimize the HD picture. (If someone knows of a way, please let me know.) But at the prize I paid - $684 - it's a tremendous deal."
3,decent tv,received this tv yesterday and it only wants to power-on some of the time. I think there is something wrong with the power supply. I called toshiba directly and they said that they have been having all kinds of problems with their lcd's. I called Amazon and they are sending a replacement tv. When the tv does turn on the picture quality is very clear. But I am extremely upset that it doesn't want to turn on whenever I want to watch tv. I was wary of buying a tv from an online store and now I know that I will never do that ever again. If you don't care about waiting for shipping or possibly having to return a tv then buy this online because it is much cheaper. I suggest you shell out the extra $100-200 bucks and buy it from your local electronics store because it is easier to return items there that have any problems.
2,Very Disappointing,"I purchased this TV on December 1, 2007 and it has malfunctioned 5 times since then, including 15 minutes before I sat down to write this review. The first time was December 5th and the problem is the same: The screen suddenly goes black but I still have sound. At first Toshiba tried to blame the cable box but I don't believe it. Toshiba's customer service tells me to unplug the TV for 5 minutes and see what happens. It has helped, but ultimately the problem repeats itself. This TV has lots of pluses, such as the audio and the picture quality, but I'm starting to regret not shelling out the extra $150 - $200 for a Panasonic."
4,AL4rfun,We have two other Sharp LCD TVs so I researched various LCD TVs online for a birthday gift for my husbandand and I kept coming back to the Toshiba 32HL67U. I couldn't find a better deal for the features and price. We've had the TV for three weeks now and I love it. My husband on the other hand is still not sure if he likes it because he really wanted the Sharp 32 inch but I think he is seeing that this TV has everything that he would have gotten in a Sharp without the higher cost. The only negative I have is that there is a delayed response when turning the TV on (maybe about a 5 second delay).Update 2011This TV stop working after 18 months so I would not recommend a Toshiba to anyone ever. To repair cost more that we were will to pay because there was no guarantee that this wouldn't happen again. Stick with Sharp or Sony...
1,Dead After Two Years,"I too thought this was a good TV, paying well over $800.00 for it about two years ago. Much like others who have reviewed this product the picture suddenly went black on my set although the sound and other commands still worked.To make a long story short I am very dissapointed with Toshiba and the costly suggestions on fixing this model so I went out and bought an LG which I love.For now the Toshiba is serving as a very fashionable 32 inch ""radio"". Just a word of caution to those that might be considering this model."
1,Another unfortunate customer,"Bought the Toshiba Regza 32"" HDTV in January of '08 and it worked just fine until yesterday when it suddenly lost its picture. Audio works fine and I can change channels, but no picture, just a blank screen. After reading the reviews here I guess I have joined the ranks of the poor souls who paid alot of money for a TV only to have it last less than 2 years. I liked this TV until yesterday. Toshiba can kiss my you know what......I'll never buy one of their products again. Unfortunately I have another Toshiba flat screen in the bedroom.....guess I'll wait and see how long it lasts. I'm buying a new TV tonight and I'll see what can be done with the Toshiba.....maybe I'll take it back to the store and leave it in front of their door. They can use it for a door stop. Buyers.....I would consider what we are saying here.....think about it."
1,TERRIBLE TELEVISION,My Regza was used as a secondary television and it only lasted 15 months before the backlight inverter panel died...leaving me with an expensive yet useless piece of junk...NO HELP FROM TOSHIBA!!!!! Buy some other brand...it cannot get much worse than this.
1,Broke after 3 months,"We had our TV three months before it broke -- it started turning on and off on its own until it just wouldn't turn on again. We gave the TV to the service center (authorized by Toshiba) who told us the part they needed was back-ordered at Toshiba. Over two weeks later, we're still in the queue to have Toshiba simply look for the part, with no guarantees as to if or when they'll find it. We've had to make multiple phone calls just to get Toshiba to do anything at all -- and we've had to act as the middle man between the authorized service center and Toshiba. I definitely won't be buying another Toshiba TV after this experience!"
5,This is the perfect LCD for my bedroom.,"I decided to purchase this Toshiba after becoming disenchanted with the sound volume output of the Sharp 32"" LCD that I had just purchased for my bedroom. My wife doesn't have a problem hearing it so I put it in her bedroom and my Toshiba has a very good audio output. Plus the picture is comparable to the Sharp. All in all the sets are very similar in Video appearance but not in Audio output."
5,beautiful,"This TV is great. picture quality is awesome. I also have a 42"" 1080p projection of another brand. Picture quality in both is so close you wouldn't know the difference. But the richness in the color of the lcd is unmatched."
3,Slow delivery,"The TV is great, but I had to wait two weeks for it to be delivered. And the origin was less than 500 miles away. No wonder it was free shipping -- I think the TV hitchhiked from the next state to get here."
4,Very nice,"It has a great picture, and there are enough ports to connect up to 8 items (dvd, sound system, game console, computer, etc). I bought this to go with my HD-DVD player (also toshiba), and was surprised that there were no codes for HD-DVDs in the manual. Also, there's no way to search for the code on the remote. So even though I have two toshiba products, I still have to use 2 remotes. But overall it is a very good product."
4,"Toshiba 32"" LCD","TV looks great, priced right. However, delivery was a hassel, took to long almost 2 weeks, but once I made contact with shipper (which you must do doesn't say that any where) things went smoother."
1,Screen broke - first day,"While following the directions to mount the screen to the pedastal, the screen cracked. We called Toshiba, to let them know we must have gotten a defective one, since it broke while following the instructions. They said we must have done something wrong and refused to do anything for us. Amazon said they would refund our money, hopefully that will happen. I will never buy toshiba again, since they do not stand behind their products."
2,Where is Will ?,"The author has some peculiar ideas about Shakespeare, contrary to accepted ideas; she suggests that it was Marlowe who stole good ideas from Shakespeare instead of near-certainty that it was the other way around; the characters think like modern Americans; the coincidences are bizarre; and the writing is stilted.If you want to learn about Shakespeare, read ""Will in the World"". If you want a mediocre historical romance, surely you could do better than this. But don't be snookered into believing you will learn anything about the real Shakespeare by this silly tripe. Ain't gonna happen."
2,"Good camera, terrible service.","My camera died after about six months. I had to send it back three times before they fixed it. I paid to send it back the first two times, about $15 each time. When I called the third time and asked to speak to someone beyond the people who answer the phone, I was scolded by the person I was talking to because I balked at calling a toll number. I was told that Canon could not give toll free numbers to everybody. I eventually talked to someone who told me to send it in again. Only, after I balked at paying shipping again did he offer to send me prepaid packaging. Guess I should have balked the first time. So far the third ""fix"" has worked for over a year.Very nice little camera. The service is very poor."
3,Nice but not so perfect,"My S30 did all it was expected to do as far as imaging resolution and photo quality was concerned.Downside issues with this camera:LCD screen - Poor to zero visibility. OK for auto shooting but useless for creative photography,Auto focus and close-up focus did not work 100% of the time. Continuous focus was hit & miss.Battery life inadequate - 20 mins to 1/2 hr at bestCamera was returned to Canon during Warranty but none of the above issues were resolved.Sold the camera after 18 months of serious useage"
2,Red Eye is a Problem,This was an OK camera but red-eye was a problem from Day 1. Also had trouble taking good night pictures. The 4 Star rating here is WAY too high for this camera. See the most recent reviews.
2,"Good in some areas, fails in others","I bought this digital camera based on the reviews that I found in the Internet. The picture I took with it looked good, portrait, landscape. I started shooting for pictures I need to put on my website, ie, up-close, 18inches. I was so disappointed because I was not able to get a clear and true picture. The white background came out golden brown and the item I was trying to get a picture off was fuzzy and did not show the true color. I tried all the settings (including Macro) available but still cannot get a true picture. I suggest to all the people who bought this camera to try and take a picture of a nice piece of necklace with a white background. I am curious how this would come out. Please let me know. For me, I am returning this camera and getting an Olympus Camedia C-4000. I think Olympus has better digital technology than Canon."
1,E18 error,"This was my first introduction to digital photography. Wouldn't you know, just out of the warranty period, the camera stops working. I test the battery just before my daughter's soccer game, then hop in the car. Get to the game and....the thing won't work. The lens will not come out. I now own a piece of junk. I think the retractable lens adds needless complexity to the camera. I will look for something simpler mechanically in the future. Maybe it's back to film cameras for me. I'm tired of 60 dollar ink cartridges anyway."
5,the love of my life!,I ABSOLUTELY love love love love love my camera I used to own the Nikon swivel cool pix and I have to say that although the s30 is a little bit heavier and larger its way better!
2,Prone to failure after the warrentee expires.,"I agree with the reviews by Simplicissimus & ""curious"", it was a great camera until it died. Mine had a critical failure just over one month past the warrentee running out. I paid $150 to have it ""repaired."" What I got back was a refurb with a different serial number. That lasted less than a year and half before it died. Given the price when I bought it, this camera has already cost me close to $800. The repair price that Canon charges will buy a new camera of the same functionality, with full warrentee. They offer an ""upgrade"" to a newer model, for $220, but that is a refurb with only a six month warrentee. I would prefer that Canon built a quality product that would last at least two years. I would settle for them at least standing behind their products when they die under normal use."
4,Very Nice,"The cammera is very nice. The bed things about it thou are that its pretty big and the ""joystick"" is very hard to operate. Its to samll to use it. But overall the quality of pictures is VERY GOOD. I would recommend this cammera to anyone."
2,Give Me A Break,I have had this camera for over a year now. The camera is great until now. I simply plugged the camera into the USB port in order to download my pictures and all the sudden my LCD DISPLAY turned White. I have tried troubleshooting and nothing is expalined about this mess. I talked to Canon and the only option they left me was to ship it in and get it repaired...for $200.00 What a joke!
3,Not quite what I expected,"... I'll summarize a few points:1) I saw a couple other ""cracked LCD screen"" comments. This is NOT BS, people. Ours cracked after just a month or so of use, and under very questionable circumstances. It may have been the sun. It may have been a bump. We don't know. But it did cost $150 to get it repaired by Canon. Not cool!2) Shutter speed: out of the box, you WILL be disappointed with the slow shutter speed (blurry pictures). The default equivalent film sensitivity is ""in the range of ISO 50 to ISO 100"". Very slow film for most apps.3) Movies: Don't pay $100 extra for the movie capability. The movies are disappointing in quality (~200x300 pixels) and length (max 30 seconds)These cons aside, the camera often does perform swimmingly."
4,S30,"I love the S30. I bought this camera specifically for underwater use (with the Canon underwater housing of course!). It is pretty easy to use and has quite a few features for the price. You probably won't need a higher pixel camera than this unless you want poster size prints. Add a 1GB IBM Microdrive, a spare battery, and you are set."
4,"Great Camera, but had to return it twice!!!!!","I purchased the S30 from J&R cat. for... great price!! I had to return it twice for the same problem of a burnt pixel, which according to canon was in the CCD not the LCD!! This was something I could not over look since my prints had a green dot in the middle where the pixel was burnt. Camera #3 seems to be OK. Otherwise, the camera is simple to use with many fun options (movie mode, B/W pictures, audio). The prints are impressively film-like (Canon S800 printer). I purchased a NEW 256 mb cf-card...works great...it gives me 154 pictures at the highest resolution!! Works well with its own Canon software, but I found that prints using Adobe LE were blurry...don't know why?!?!? Not a big deal. The bottom line is that it is a good camera, with many features, film-like resolution, good price, good looks, and the Canon name. BUY A LARGER CF CARD!!!!!!"
5,Second digital owned,"I have had the this camera for 2 weeks and have been very pleased. I also own an Olympus digital. There is no comparison in the ease of use, the ease of the software, and the simplicity of the menu functions of the Canon over the Olympus. Olympus is still a good camera, but the large step up to the Canon just shows how good a camera this is. I am very happy."
5,AWESOME CAMERA!,"I bought this camera in April 2002 (right before I had my first baby). As of this month Dec 02, I have taken almost 3,000 pictures. I LOVE IT!!!!!!! It's small yet durable. I am a picture fanatic. I take a camera with me everywhere I go. Now, I've become so dependant on this digital one, I don't even take another camera with me. The pictures turn out excellent and it is very quick and easy to download. The only problem I have had is keeping the battery charged. I bought an additional battery and think that it is definitely necessary (if you take lots of pictures). I even take my pictures in a medium resolution and they still turn out excellent. I usually fit over 200 photos on a 128 MB card. Well worth the money!"
1,Great Camera w/ Dead Pixels!!!,"Well this has been an excellent digital camera. I have taken lots of baby photoes with it and the quality is great EXCEPT for one or more dead pixels!I have sent it in for a warrantly repair. But it hasn't been repaired properly. Now the dead pixel is at a different location.To see if your camera is affected, view the downloaded image at 100% on your PC. Scan the image closely and look for a ""bright"" pixel.It would have been a 5 stars if not for the HORRIBLE quality control of the CCD."
4,The Thinking Machine is back!,"The stories are a little dated, but they're as entertaining as they were 45 years ago when I first read them. I downloaded six Thinking Machine books to my kindle, and I'm glad I did."
3,Great little knife,"Perfect for opening the many Amazon packages I receive each week. The bottle opener is not very good and I have no idea why the ridges are part of the design, but if you just want a handy box opener this one is good.Not crazy about the color though, but this was the only color they had in stock."
2,Too big for what it is,"It's a great little design for this knife, but it's just too big. It's almost two inches wide (to fit the bottle opener) and 2.5 inches long. The blade is barely an inch (not a complaint--that's what I wanted).This is a knife meant for someone who wants just a short blade, who doesn't want to be the kind of person who carries a pocket knife. But the design does't work. The cool factor doesn't make up for the bulk and weight.It is well made. This is clearly a Buck, but that's not enough here. I gave mine away and bought the Buck 325 Colleague."
2,Disappointing,"This plunger must only work on certain types of toilets, because I couldn't get an airtight seal - at least, not with the larger attachment. However, I discovered that the smaller attachment - meant for sinks and whatnot - did help a bit to at least DRAIN the toilet, but not clear the clog.I can recommend this for sinks and other drains, but not for toilets. At least, not my toilet."
4,Flying Colors,"This large book is packed with colorful drawings of aircraft from WW2 to 1981. The book features 113 aircraft presented in a variety of color schemes, usually in profile but occationally from the overhead perspective. As a modeler I use this book when painting miniature aircraft. The book is 207 pages long. There is minimal text. The text includes a brief introduction, then continues by briefly explaining each of the illustrations."
5,I'm impressed with When's Recess,"I found _'When's Recess?' by Howard Papush delightful, adorable, refreshing, and very well researched. As an educator, it really appealed to my sense of fun, my desire to learn more, and my many interests.The premise of the book, that everyone needs some play to balance their lives , is terrific. The book is peppered with great stories, interesting ""star biographies"" and a feeling that makes you want to smile and de stress. I loved the quotes at the beginning of each chapter, and I did feel like skipping and connecting with my Inner Child. The book has a great deal of merit, and Mr. Papush has developed his ideas very well."
1,Item never arrived,CONS:*The Video I ordered never arrived. So much for Valentines day! Don't order from this merchant unless you don't want your order to arrive.*Merchant didn't provide tracking for my order. I was left in the dark for a good three weeks.PRO:*Merchant was good about returning emails and FINALLY crediting my Visa account.
5,An unforgetable love story.,"I'm a lover of classic film. I love Lew Ayres and Jane Wyman. Long before Jane Wyman and Rock Hudson, this love story was unforgettable. The heart warming story of a love seen through the eyes and soul of a young woman who can't hear or talk. How one person changes her world and brings a since of worth and diginty to her life. Grab a hankie."
3,Reality Plus,"You will marvel at how the cast carries out the twists and turns of this movie to make you a believer. On the windswept, rocky fields of the MacDonald farm in Nova Scotia, a young deaf mute girl lives her life, her afflication mistakenly viewed as mental deficieney. However, a new Doctor in town becomes interested in her case and seeks to help her break out of her silent prison. Jane Wyman plays the yourg girl, perfectly portraying this characters longing to break out of this prison of isolation into the light of knowledge and success."
5,A sensitive and brilliant film,"Jane Wyman deservedly won the Best Actress Oscar for her portrayal of Belinda, the deaf-mute who becomes a mother after being raped. It is such a wonderful performance, as Belinda grows in knowledge and life experiences, helped along by Lew Ayres as a kind-hearted doctor who comes to Cape Breton Island after some problems in his own personal life. The two of them grow together, and overcome some severe obstacles before they can find happiness. Charles Bickford as Belinda's father and Agnes Moorhead as Belinda's aunt also give stellar performances.Ahead of its time in terms of subject matter (treatment of the handicapped and the stigma of rape), this film holds up well after all of these years. One of my long-time favorites, and a true classic."
4,Jane Wyman is great! The story is moving,"I just ""discovered"" Jane Wyman a couple of weeks ago when I saw ""All that Heaven Allows,"" another Wyman triumph. In ""Johnny Belinda"" she plays a lonely deaf woman who has never learned a way to communicate with the world. Then, along comes a lonely doctor who makes it his business to teach her. Of course, none of this goes unnoticed by the small town residents that surround them. The story is engrossing and moving, but really the film is worth watching for Wyman's wordless performance alone--she's really one of the best. Don't know how I avoided seeing her all these years but I sure plan on checking out any of her movies I can get ahold of. Also, Agnes Moorehead (who apparently made quite a few films with Wyman) gives another spectacular performance as Wyman's spinster aunt."
5,Johnny Belinda,Movie is old classic I remember watching when I was in high school. Recommended viewing for older people who would appreciate the story line. Very good acting. Amazon always has what you want and affordable prices for seniors.
5,Great Classic Movie,I seen the movie when it first came out. The DVD is of excellent quality. A B&W classic from the days of yesteryear.
4,a heroic story,this is almost a perfect movie if there is such a thing. characters perfect. story perfect if not sad. you cheer for belinda all the way.
5,Great film!,"I saw this film about 20 years ago on TV and remember how great it was. I happened upon it one day when looking for movies with Agnes Moorehead. I purchased immediately.I was amazed then AND now about the subject matter (rape and pregnancy). I wonder what the audiences thought when this film was release in 1948? My Mom told me some of the audience walked out because they considered it ""offensive"".Item arrived new and quick...thanks!!...Brian"
1,SCAM!,WARNING!!!! PLZ LISTEN.Ok so most of the buyers of this product are going to be dissapointed to hear that this jersey is a replica from china which you can get for 25 dollars with a group order. Dont follow these sellers because THEY ARE!! RIPPING YOU OFF!!. The real stiched jersey does not have poor quality stiching and it is a different color. Not saying that these jerseys are bad but you can get them alot cheaper.
1,Wrong item shipped,"They sent me the wrong item. I had placed order for blue Peyton Manning Jersey and instead they shipped me the white jersey. I was checking for the blue jersey and everywhere else said it was out of stock. Instead of truthfully saying that the item is out of stock, they send the different jersey. I was planning to surprise my husband but had to return it and the surprise was ruined as well. VERY DISSAPOINTED!"
1,DO NOT PURCHASE FROM HERE,"While the individuals I spoke with were nice, please consider not purchasing from here. It was over a week from the time I originally placed the order and noticed the money was not withdrawn and the order had not shipped yet ... the site said it was ""shipping soon"" and still says that. I requested the order be cancelled and it was. Almost two weeks later, I receive another email stating they do not have this item and had to cancel my order because of that. It is obvious they do not know what is going on and are not honest about what they have in stock or not."
2,Not nice,Not really very good but i like it anyway. melodramatic with some nice guitar sounds. bad drums drowning out a worse bass
1,Not worth the time,"I don't know why it won the National Book Award. This book is very slow, & very boring. Where is the action? I forced myself to finish it."
1,Do not waste your time!,This is the WORST book that I have ever read! Every page reads like the author went a little too crazy with the Thesaurus tool on her computer! I read this for a book club and everyone in the club agreed that the main character is next to impossible to like or feel any connection with. By the end of the book we all could have cared less about what happened to any of the characters and were very disappointed about the waste of our time! I would rather read a trashy romance novel (and I hate those!).
2,Welcome To The Pity Party,"It is obvious that Ms. Dew has great writing talent but the characters in this book are so distasteful that it was difficult for me to read.The main character, Dinah, is completely self-obsessed and lives her life waiting for the other characters to apologize to her for inconsequential things that happened during her youth.I wanted to shake Dinah and tell her to move on!"
3,"A good, not great, first novel","Because I read Dew's later novels first, I found this one not quite as good. It is, however, a very interesting 'novel of character.' It is an 'interior' story, along the lines of 'Madame Bovary' and 'Anna Karenina,' with everything viewed from the specific perspectives of various characters. Since one can see their innermost thoughts and feelings, of course one won't find them ""likeable."" Who of us would be if people knew exactly what we were thinking or feeling? If you aren't interested in WHY people behave the way they do, or if you want an action-packed story in which motivation doesn't matter, you probably won't like this novel. If you're fascinated by how others think and respond, you will."
1,Dale Loves Sophie to Death,"This was one of the most uneventful, anticlimatical books I have read. It did not even give mental illness a creative twist. No stars! (I had to give it one star just to move along the electronic site...)"
2,Much ado about nothing,"Very little plot, very little dialogue, highly unlikeable characters and many, many words. The writing's not bad, but someone should've told the author that a little action and conversation go a long way in holding the reader's attention and interest. Disappointing."
2,It's just not my kind of style.,"If you're looking to learn how to get ten or fifteen different patterns and colors to work together in one room, and don't mind it if guests ask to wear sunglasses when they visit, then this book is for you. If not, or if you're prone to dizzy spells, pass. In truth, it's just not my kind of style."
3,"Good buy, works well for the price","This little radio is a good buy for its very low price. It is one of the few very inexpensive radios to have a pretty reasonable little speaker.Its low price means you can leave it in your car or hotel room without worrying about a big loss. Take it to the picnic ground, the beach, or whatever. It slips right into your pocket. This radio also makes a nice inexpensive present for young kids.You might compare this radio to JWin's JXM14. The JXM14 costs just a few dollars more but has a digital readout (for its analog tuner). This makes it quite a bit easier to tune in specific stations. The JXM6's analog dial makes it difficult to haul in specific stations that are not among the most powerful broadcasters in your area."
4,Does its job,"Does its job, fits in the trumpet case. I like that it has the coating to keep from scratching the interior of the trumpet. I do wish the bristles were a little more substantial, but time will tell if that is actually a problem."
3,Personally prefer the metal snakes,The vinyl coated snakes never have worked well for me. They always seem to get stuck and not push/pull through the trumpet easily. I only use the metal snakes now and have had little issues with them. They pull much easier and make cleaning your trumpet a little less frustrating. There are a few metal ones on Amazon...here is one:Micro Trumpet/Cornet Cleaning Snake
5,Luvit,Great product for Teens. Fun for all and great to use to get to know people and understand the way they perceive things
5,Promotes Self-Expression for Teens,"I use the Pocket Ungame for Teens with teens who are in therapy. It is a non-threatening way to allow them to relate to an adult and it seems to help them to express their emotions and to talk about themselves. It is convenient, easy to use, and fun!Johanna Slivinske, MSWAuthor of ""Storytelling and Other Activities for Children in Therapy""Storytelling and Other Activities for Children in Therapy"
2,Not the usual Lynn Harris,"I want to leave feedback at Lynn Harri's website, but i don't know how to start. I re-read several of his novels many many times (I did re-read ""Invisible life"" like 8 times), but I can't say i will with his last novel. Harris is now concerned about boring subjects. What made him special and different isn't there anymore. He's been tagged as a brilliant storyteller, but in this book there's no emotion at all, just a common story. No special moments, no wonderful descriptions, no heart-felt characters. Everything is too standard, I wonder where he's been all these last months. And i hope he'll be get back to his tracks. This is no evolution, i'm, so sad to say."
3,Just Not That Good,"I have been a huge fan of Harris since his first novel. I've attended readings and book signings and always buy his books the day they come out. His are books that I will devour because of his characters and plot developments. Sadly, Just Too Good to be True does not measure up to his earlier efforts.I heard Harris on Wendy Williams' show and he explained how some of his Arkansas students helped him write the dialogue for his characters. Perhaps that's why much of the dialogue was simply not believable. Worse than the dialogue, though, is that the characters in this book seem particularly one-dimentional. They do things that are simply not realistic and it's difficult to develop a real relationship with them.I'll continue to read Harris, but after this book I won't be standing in line to have him autograph the next one."
3,Slightly Disappointed,"The story was very predictable. I continued to read hoping that my predictions would be wrong, but I was correct on each one. Making predictions and then finding that I couldn't be further from the truth, makes for interesting reading for me.The book was an easy read and Mr. Harris continues with his vivid descriptions of people, places and things that make you feel as if you're a fly on the wall."
5,"Great Job, Mr. Harris","Mr. Harris did a good job stepping out of the box in this novel while still allowing a cameo from a character from previous novels to step in. I once heard him describe himself as a person who could tell a good story and that's exactly what he did in this novel. It's a page turner leaving you wanting him to write a sequel. If you're an E. Lynn fan, a football fan, or a lover of good stories, I recommend this novel."
3,Pretty Good,"This book was pretty good, but predictable. To me, the ending seemed rushed. None of the characters stories were never really closed out. Maybe he did that to leave room open for a second book. There were alot of things unanswered for me when I finished the book, but it was still entertaining."
2,Nobody's Perfect,"E. Lynn gives us a predictable piece of fluff that tells the tale of Heisman trophy hopeful, Brady Bledsoe, and his saintly mother, Carmyn. The perfect relationship between mother and son becomes strained when schemer, Barrett Browning, enters the picture and you can easily see how this story will end.First, the character names - is Brady Bledsoe supposed to be an amalgam of Tom Brady and Drew Bledsoe? Barrett Elizabeth Browning - clearly a spin of the famous poetess Elizabeth Barrett Browning. I mean, really?Second, the story is mostly dialogue, which makes it easy to read, but shows a lack of substance.There is nothing remotely interesting about this story and certainly not worth a purchase. It just seems that instead of building on what made his earlier works so successful and noteworthy, the author has slipped into the trap of publishing something just to stay in the game. Get it from the library."
4,Nice Change of Pace,"This was a good change of pace for Mr. Harris. Although, some of the same language from the other books was used, it was interesting to see it used in a almost completely heterosexual context. Looking forward to his next work of fiction, and the movie of one his earlier novels."
4,Great book,"I thought that this was a good book, I have read mostly all of Harris's books and this one was just as good. I wonder is there a sequel to this book, there was no ending for what happened to Brady best friend and his mother or the baby's mother. I think that would make a great story. I can't wait to read his next book Basketball Jones."
5,Another standing ovation for an outstanding work!,"I can't say anything better than what's been said already. E. Lynn Harris definitely made this book worth the wait. The characters are different, the storyline is different, but the page-turning obsession continues in Harris' latest work. If you've enjoyed E. Lynn before, you will definitely enjoy this one as well. For anyone raised in the South, a lover of college sports, or someone who has simply experienced the drama of an undergraduate college degree, this book has something for everyone. I am anxiously awaiting the next masterpiece!!! Bravo, Mr. Harris, Bravo!!!"
3,To Good to Be True!,"This was an okay read about love, secrets and betrayal. Some parts had you confuse. I felt the book could have been better."
4,Different for Harris,"This was a good story...far different from the usual down low drama that Mr. Harris masterfully creates. This time, it is a college student that is being manipulated by his mother.RIP E Lynn Harris...I was so sad to hear he passed away. Another one gone too soon."
5,Excellent! A Great Read!,"I really enjoyed this one. I read this book in a day and a half and it kept me wanting to find out more. I think E. Lynn did a great job capturing my attention and giving a realistic version of the strong bond between parent and child. There were lots of twists, turns & secrets. This is a must-read and I certainly recommend it!"
2,Good plot,"Alright so this was my first book by E. Lynn Harris (RIP) and I wanted very much to fall in love with it, but just couldn't get into it. The only reason that I finished this book was because I really wanted to find out what happened in the end. The plot would have been wonderful if half of the side stories were eliminated. E. Lynn Harris used very childish language in this book such as on p. 181 when he writes ""I slipped my Yolanda Adams CD into the Bose CD player,"" was it necessary to explain what type of CD player that it was? Sadly a lot language in the book was framed like this, making it difficult at times to sift through it. I really did enjoy the last 1/3 of the book. I was elated to see Barrett and Nico get what they deserve, also it was nice to see Brady and Carmyn's relationship evolve."
5,Great Read!!!,"Mr. Harris has ""Sho' Nuff"" done it again. This book was juicy, juicy, juicy. As all his books. This one has outdone itself. Very good characters, good storyline shall I go on? My coworkers can't wait to get a copy, since I put the word out. I loved this book so much it inspired me to read invisible life(his first novel) all over again!!! waiting with baited breath for the next one!"
5,"Yes, Too Good to Put Down!",E. Lynn Harris is at it again; he is the best and the book is an excellent diverson from the others. I could not put it down and in fact read it in two days!!
3,Just OK to me!,"This book was just ok to me compared to the others books that I have ready by E. Lynn Harris. I thought the story line was a good one.. but ""just too good to be true"". The characters didn't seem very real to me. A little too far fetched in my opinion. On a scale from 1 to 10, I would give it a 7."
4,E. LYNN HARRIS at has BEST!,"Mr. Harris was bless with the skills of story telling, giving the reader all he or she needs to capture the charcters and their struggles.The charcters are as deverse as the world,with all of its imperfection.This is a book that hits home the youth of the world and the realities of life lesson of parenting."
3,"Worst Book Of His, What A Let Down :(","2 Stars or 3 Stars, that is the question. I bought this book the DAY before E. Lynn Harris passed away and that made me want to read it even more. I wish I could give this book a great review but I just can't. I was so disappointed. I thought this book would awesome based on the first couple of chapters but nope. The only reason I continued to read on was because I don't like starting something and not finishing it plus I was waiting for all of the secrets to come out. Granted, this book was a quick and easy read but it wasn't smooth, didn't really keep my attention, and wasn't worth the $11 I paid for it. After a short while this book became predictable and I was very glad when I finished it so I could put it on my bookshelf and never look at it again lol."
3,good read,i must say i neva read E Lynn Harris but it was slow read. it took me awhile to get in to the book. i had to put it down the book many times but i kept thinking wats goin to happen wats going to happen. the mother is like what alot of mothers shud b with their sons. i give her alot of props on giving her son room until things gets better between them. but i must say it was a good read after awhile.
5,What you come to expect from E. Lynn Harris.,"E. Lynn Harris writes with confidence, authority and compassion. His characters thrive, feel, desire, make mistakes, fail and ultimately succeed just like all of us. The players in JUST TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE come to life so much that you can't help but despise some of them, adore some, even try to talk sense into their heads through the pages. The story is engrossing, the pacing is whiplash fast, the message clear, and the lessons learned stick with you, informing many of your decisions long after the last page is turned. Highly reccomended!"
5,Outstanding,I thought this book is classic E Lynn I enjoyed it from begining to end and can't wait for the next one!
3,Good read but second-rate,It is not the required suspension of disbelief which limits this novel but rather the somewhat disjointed plot and an ending which even the psychic detectives in Noah Bishop's Special Crimes Unit don't come close to foreseeing. The interplay between Lucas Jordan and Samantha Burke adds interest. I was disappointed that no credible clues were left to even hint at the identity of the villain who is just pulled out of a hat at the end.
4,Hunting fear,I have read many books by Kay Hooper and this is one of the best that I have. I completely advise anyone who is a fan to read this book
2,Disappointing Ending,"The ending was so disappointing. It seemed so rushed, was not as suspenseful as the whole novel. I liked it for the most part because it is very vivid, creative, different but the ending just ruined it."
2,Too Much Talk not enough action,"In the words of Paul Revere and the Raiders, this book has ""Too much talk and not enough action."" Would have made a good edited short story. To many conversations where the characters repeat themselves. Got bored with this."
5,SIX para...stars,"It doesn't matter if you believe or not in paranormal things. It doesn't matter if you don't read paranormal books because they're spooky. Albeit this book has all of that and yes, you'll be spooked two or three times, it's worth to read the book because the plot won't let you put it down. The spooky part is almost nothing and you can enjoy an excellent reading even if you don't like that. And I have to tell you that the end of the book is really creepy but not spooky."
3,Why should we care?,"Hooper, seems to be churning out books with out investing any effort. Samantha and Lucas are so similiar to every other couple in Hooper's other books. Another, serial killer ho hum. Please, the only thing left interesting is the paranormal aspect and she's starting to make that tedious also."
2,Too much talk.,"OK plot, but way too much yalking about relationships between the characters. Obviously written for women - the literary equivalent of a chick flick."
3,Spooky Crimes Unit,I enjoyed this book. It's a little out there but who knows? The psychic approach to solving crimes isn't that far from profiling and after all it is fiction. The characters are likable and I plan to read more in the series.
1,x-men in disguise,"This is a silly poorly written book. Nothing bugs me more than sloppy writing and this book has it in spades. Hooper jumps from character to character with little transition. You are unable to grab hold of the story because it never sits still long enough for you the reader to enjoy it. This is totally a comic book novel. I felt like I was watching an x-men movie instead of reading a book. I even started to find myself envisioning characters in the story upon the appearances of characters like the old star trek guy and wolverine. I couldn't stop thinking of them that way.Their is no real redeeming quality to this book. I made the mistake perhaps of making this my first Hooper story. If there was some sort of character development in this series, it definitely did not occur in this story.STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK."
1,Does not function,"This product was flawed and a 'Total wast of time'I purchased it for somebody else as they wanted to listen to CD books without having to use headphones, it would Not function. Forget it! Save yourself a lot of headaches, and return costs."
3,poor headphones,"The CD player is pretty good, but the enclosed headphones were awefull. Sound breaks in and out, they also feel and are cheap. Replace the headphones and you're ok"
3,Please enter a title for your review,"I listened to this because Mark Hoppus talks about them on his podcast. Like buddyhead the dude has a great sense of humour but kinda indiscriminate taste in music. What struck me immediately is how much the vocals sound like Depeche Mode, and more new DP than old DP. The music generally seems unambitious and not even very contemporary. It reminds me more than anything of a more understated version of INXS and to a lesser extent U2, exhibiting a similarly faceless blend of pop and rock that brings it's pop leanings to the forefront but never really achieves any distinct or memorable hooks or melodies. I guess the fact that they're on 33rd Street Records, a label that generally releases hopelessly outdated conservative unhip music, and boasts a website that looks like it was designed by an 8 year old down's syndrome sufferer, seems apt."
4,Highly Recommend Something For Rockets,"I immediately fell in love with the melodic upbeat tunes. Great for dancing or thinking of the one you love, DM. For those who enjoy stylish and energetic beats, I highly recommend."
3,"Not exactly my cup of tea, but...","I picked up an old copy of this Victorian novel in a used bookstore. It's not the sort of book I usually like much - the oft-told story of a woman seduced by a villain into leaving her happy home, and the shame, remorse, and misery that follow her downfall - but I found it very readable, I would even say a page-turner. Plenty of pathos and moralizing, as there generally is in these things, but much better than I expected."
4,"""Next week, East Lynne.""","That's what they used to advertise in the days of barnstorming melodramas, and it became something of a catchphrase. The novel on which the perennial melodrama is based is actually a wonderful read, although terribly far-fetched; but perhaps this is what makes it fun. What is NOT fun is the unforgiving nature of its morality. Yes, we all know that sin must be punished -- but this poor woman is punished, and punished, and punished. And what was the point of giving the villain a Jewish name?"
5,The Phillips Pholks left OttLite in the dark!!,I recently needed a replacement bulb for an OttLite Desk lamp I have. Did some googling and eBay hunting and found that my OttLite required a bulb which cost $18(+-). That seemed a bit high for an otherwise ordinary florescent bulb so I did some reading on what was so special about my bulb...and thats when I found out... absolutely nothing was except for the way the type of bulb was explained by OttLite. I did a bit more research and found the Phillips bulb I bought. Tried one to see if it might work and saved nearly 75% with the low shipping charge. OttLite...You make a great product but shame on you for the bulb screwing (no pun intended) you give the public when they need a replacement.
4,Good Everyday Recipes,"I am a big fan of the Better Homes & Gardens cookbooks - the recipes are pretty traditional and rarely call for exotic ingredients (i.e. things that are not readily found in my pantry!). This book does have a good variety or recipes. The chapters are: Pressure Cooker Basics; Soups, Stews, Chiles and Chowders; Poultry and Meat; Vegetarian Main Dishes; Vegetable Side Dishes; Desserts.I *think* that this 2000 hardcover edition is exactly the same as the 1995 edition - the copyright date inside mine says 1995. So unless Amazon shipped me the wrong one, it's the same book. The hardcover is nice - it's spiralbound inside so it will be easy to cook from. But if you're looking to save a few bucks you can get the same recipes from the 1995 paperback edition."
4,I am very happy,with the company that I bought from and the time the book was recieved. The reason I rated it less was that the actual book isn't very good. It is nothing to do with the business. I will order from them again. The condition was even better than I thought when I ordered.
1,Not Specifically For Programmable Pressure Cookers,I bought the Better Homes and Gardens Pressure Cooker Cookbook at the same time I ordered the Faberware FPC400 Programmable Pressure Cooker. I was under the impression this cook book would be specific to the programmable pressure cooker but it's not. I've used a stove top pressure cooker for the past 20 years so I didn't need to add another cookbook to my collection for that type of use. I'm very disappointed with my selection because it is not what I expected. Does anyone have information about where I can get a cookbook for the Faberware FPC 400 programmable pressure cooker?!?
5,One of my favorite albums - Ever!!!,"This album is truly phenomenal. It's unfortunate that this was the only one the band released before they vanished from existence. It's metal in it's greatest form. Heavy, fast, melodic - mind blowing. I never get tired of listening to it. This belongs in the same category as Imperanon's album, Stained and Throne of Chaos' ablum, Menace and Prayer - both of which, as it happens, are also ""one album wonders"". Well, TOC has another, but it's so different from M&P that it might as well be a different band. Highly recommended."
2,Not helpful at all,"For my purposes, it is not helpful. I am trying to teach myself and this book just jumps in expecting you to know already what you are doing. And then on top of it, all the notes are labeled which does not help me to learn. I think it is okay if you just want to play popular tunes straight from the book but not on actually learning about reading music or technique."
3,GOOD MUSIC - STRANGE NOTATION,"I liked the ""easy piano"" in this book; however the very unorthodox notation gave me a problem; it would have been - to me at least - easier to follow if they had used standard notation."
2,Difficult book,This book is very difficult for me to understand. I am a beginner and for me this book is hard to understand. I was disappointed. Learning something new is hard for me and this book is no help me to. I'm not saying it isn't a good book for beginners but for the thick headed like me it's not a good book.
5,A brilliant bio of an Artist in Bali,"Lavishly illustrated and clearly written by historian/biographer and well-known Bali expert Bruce Carpenter, this recounts a romantic age when the west ""discovered"" the unique culture of Bali"
2,Not For Me,Not much to say except that this product did not work for me. The color is not deep enough for my light olive skin.
4,Fair Warning,"This seems to be an alternative title for ""Lying with the Enemy."" Same picture on cover, etc. Do wish they'd warn us so we don't wind up with 2 copies of the same book--just different titles."
2,Unsatisfying,"The situation that the Guernsey islanders found themselves during WW II is presented. The murder of a girl who had collaborated with the occupiers seems interesting until the murderer and motive are revealed, and then that ALL falls flat. The solution was very unsatisfying as was the aftermath. I felt that much of the writing was disjointed. The author seems intent on giving personalities and backgrounds for characters that go on interminably for pages and with few periods or paragraphs, often with little reason for the hundreds of minifacts related. I read the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society which piqued my interest in the Channel Islands during that time. Loved that book. The book seems to have 2 titles: Lying with the Enemy and Island Madness. Can't imagine why. Lying with the Enemy seems the best to me."
5,This CD RULES!,"I bought the CD at their CD release show in Phoenix, and I thought it was really great, it's better then their demo. They're even better in person. And they were voted ""Most likely to make it big."" by the Newtimes Showcase. Buy this CD if you like great music."
5,Soul Stirring,"Rev. Belin has brought back a genre of gospel music that has been overlooked for awhile. These hymns and spirituals are so moving to the soul. We've not enjoyed such a rich baritone since Whitley Phipps or Paul Robeson. from the Lord's Prayer through My Tribute, we were impressed with the richness of his voice. We could feel the power of the Lord coming through. We enthusiastically recommend this CD to Christian music lovers of all tastes."
5,"Travel Map of Venice, Italy",This is a great map of the city on water resistance paper. Will be with us while spending time in Venice. Have marked on it the location of items we wish to visit. We also have the Rome Rough Guide Map that we are taking on our trip.
4,Harder on the eyes than Streetwise,"We used this map for Venice and Streetwise for Rome. I found this map to be a little clumsier in folding/unfolding than Streetwise, and the contrast and text size to be harder on the eyes than Streetwise. But the accuracy and detail were excellent. The paper is tougher than it seems at first; it held up through multiple times of being stuffed in pockets or folded back to see a particular area."
5,An utter essential!,"Just used this map on a trip to Venice. Would still be searching for my hotel without it! This sturdy, tough map took my stuffing it into my bag over a 100 times and helped me to make it through 5 days in Venice without getting lost once! It helped to know the routes of the water boats, times when museum's were open, and gave some great ideas of places to visit. One small thing is that they seem to have renamed a route of the Vaporetto - from ""82"" as on the map to just ""2"". Buy it if you are going to Venice - You'll need it!"
5,Accurate and durable,"Used the Rough Guide maps for Venice, Florence, and Rome and found them to be top notch. They have far more detail and accuracy than the maps handed out by hotels and local TI offices. The paper is coated so that it withstands serious abuse, fold, refold, stuff it in your pocket in a wad, it always comes out with all the print intact. The coating adds negligible bulk, more than worth it for the durability."
5,Perfect in a city where a map is a must-have!,"This was a great map! If you want to go anywhere in Venice other than the Rialto bridge or St. mark's square, you will need a map. I put this map through hell, folding it every which way and even dropping it in a rain puddle - oops :) the map stood up to my abuse perfectly and was great for getting us around. we didn't have to find the TI to get a map, and i liked it way better than the nice map our hotel gave us. I highly recommend this map and will use others when we travel!"
4,Lite and fun superhero sit-com,"The book reprints the first 8 issues of the Sensational She-Hulk by John Byrne. The book has an interesting history since Byrne left the title after issue 8, then returned more than a year later and pretended the intervening issues never happened.But that's another story... in this book you get 8 light and funny issues. She-Hulk confronts a variety of minor villains, makes jokes, breaks the 4th wall and generally has fun being a comic book character.Some of the sight gags are quite good and the meta-gags are clever.This isn't a classic, but it's fun and worth a read. Since it's out of print prices may vary. I think it's worth $10-15 but don't pay more than $20."
5,Something for the Heart.,"Who says this woman can't make me cry? Who says this woman can't make me dance? Here she is...the quintessence of silent longing as well as volatile and at times savage expression. Turn out the lights for 20 ANOS BLUE. The arrangement fits her like a flowing gown, and the words will touch your soul. Listen to her articulation...perfection, every syllable crafted to tweak your heart. There is nostalgia, lamentation, joy, romance, mystery and magic. Listen in the dark to this fallen Angel and be glad she left us the essence of her beauty."
4,Sick & Twisted Fun,"Jane White Is Sick and Twisted has just hit the video stores and rental palaces. A film that already has a cult following, it was not easily found in theaters. Those who did wander across it and stayed to watch realized that this is a truly subversive gem. It has, as they always say, a star-studded cast. Well, they were stars at one time or another and mostly on television in many cases, but they are all recognizable faces and names for avid viewers That's probably appropriate since this film ponders what a life completely shaped by television might be like. Who can resist seeing a great many familiar faces like Maureen McCormick and Wil Wheaton act themselves into a corner from which their careers may never recover. Just kidding but it is a hoot to watch though since none of the characters are anywhere near sane in Jane's world. ...."
3,"Definitely ""out there""","I wanted to see this movie for Danica McKellar ever since I saw a photo of her character. She has done a bunch of small stuff recently, but none of it's on DVD. Anyway, she only had about 2 minutes screen time (counting the bonus stuff), but it was worth it. ""Winnie"" she is not, here. Her character appears on a Jerry Springer show equivalent as a gum-smacking, stretch-pant wearing, sexually starved wife of a black man who thinks he's the son of God. Her husband argues back and then proceeds to french kiss Maureen McCormick's character, who is wearing a plastic bird on her head.Alley Mills was a welcome addition as the alcoholic, smoking mother. Again, not ""Norma Arnold"" at all. She had a good sized role and was great.The movie is definitely ""out there"". I'm not one for goofiness or silliness, but this made me laugh a bit, regardless.Worth renting at least - and buying of you are a fan of Kim Little, Wil Weaton, or even Alley Mills. Lots of other TV people in supporting roles."
2,"Good parts, an overall disaster","This movie has a number of little gems - the soundtrack, typecast-bending casting of Dustin Diamond, Danica McKellar, Maureen McCormick, Alley Mills, and Michelle Phillips, and great performances from Colin Mochrie and Wil Wheaton. It's fun to watch the references to television shows that pop up in titles, credits and dialogue.So why is it so awful?I mean really, really, unwatchable.Part of it may be due to the fact that Kim Little (the eponymous Jane White) is not funny. At all. And the writing is painfully bad. It should be played, as Wil Wheaton and Colin Mochrie do, with a full knowledge that it is bad, but so pop-culture referential that it should not matter. But when most of the film concentrates on the main character and she is just so dreadful, well...it's just awful.If you're a fan of Wil Wheaton or Colin Mochrie, rent it. But don't buy it."
4,A Cult Classic!,"A cult classic that has moments of brilliance...And, seriously, you might as well catch it now, because some day you'll probably be dressing up as Jane and reciting the dialogue along with the rest of the audience during the midnight screening in some run-down repertory theatre."
2,eh,"Entertaining for a moment, but cheap tricks and cameos aren't enough. I can't even remember the major plot points. I would pass on this in the future."
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money,"I wanted to like this - because the premise sounded so promising - but had to shut it off after about 30 minutes. I like dumb movies, movies that are ""Grade Z"" - but I have to find SOMETHING to laugh about in a movie. It wasn't even remotely amusing. I purchased this because of the rave reviews it got here on Amazon. This one's going into the garbage - a waste of money."
5,The Funniest Film EVER!,The perfect movie for today's stressful times. This film is funnier than `THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY!
4,Genetic Algorithms Classic for Engineering,"This book presents an inspirational synthesis from mathematics, computer science and systems theory addressing genetic algorithms and their role in intelligent engineering/business systems.Topics include: background, a formal framework, illustrations (genetics, economics, game playing, searches, pattern recognition and statistical inference, control and function optimization, and central-nervous system), schemata, the optimal allocation of trials, reproductive plans and genetic operators, the robustness of genetic plans, adaptation of coding and representations, and overview, interim and prospectus.Inclusion of a disk of spreadsheet-based examples would have increased user-friendliness to the sometimes moderately-complex mathematics. Otherwise, this book is a well presented, and useful classic for researchers and software vendors seeking to develop more innovative intelligent products."
4,"""Can We Play Again?""","I take care of 3 children, 4 year old twins and an 8 year old...I've played this game with them and their friends many times and the response is always wonderful. Different educational aspects meet each child's needs and they always want to play again!! I highly recommend Lako's School Days."
2,"Says many phrases, all of them the same...","""Hi, I'm Flounder."" ""Hi, I'm Flounder."" ""Hi, I'm Flounder."" If you want to hear this nonstop, buy this doll. Despite the claim it says other things, ours seems to have a bug and says this 99% of the time. I've heard it say ""Big Bully"" or something like that once, after I changed the battery.Annoying to say the least.And the bottom is very lumpy and hard. I guess it's so it ""scoots"" across a hard surface, but I thought I was just buying a ""giggle"" doll that vibrates, not a rock hard doll that could hurt a toddler if dropped on them..."
5,Absolutely Capital!,"This audiobook collection is terriffic. The stories are amazing and get you on the edge of your chair or wherever your listening to it. I think that if youu want a good story or stories get this collection, it's worth it."
4,Pure Irish Piping,"If you like traditional Irish Uilleann pipes, this album is definitely for you. It is a wonderful collection of great Irish tunes by truly talented players. For the most part they are unaccompanied by other instruments, and without any slick producing. It is this unrefined music, thought, that can truly give one an appreciation of how beautiful this difficult to master instrument can be. If you like A beautiful Irish tenor or rollicking pub songs, this might not be for you, however, as this is just pure piping."
5,Great information,This book was recommended to me as I walk through cancer treatment with a friend. I have found lots of helpful information re. cancer. Great resource.
4,"100 Questions & Answers About Breast Cancer, Second Edition (100 Questions & Answers about . . .)",I purchased this book to give to someone special to me who has breast cancer. This book was recommended by someone who's sister had breast cancer.
1,"Poor Shipping, Never Received","Shipping Department, is it an old lady on a bike?? Never received, same address, out in mail land for over 3 weeks."
1,Damaged goods,"Someone should be more ""On the ball"" in the shipping department and not send out goods in a distressed condition."
1,"Haven't seen it, but the looks of it...",The cover and feel of this movie looks cheesy. Just like a regular Filipino movie! But where's Sharon Cuneta?
4,"Great for those who ""get it""...","Okay, I have to agree that there are some holes in this film--fairly predictable plot points, less than stellar acting from some of the cast... The truth is, this movie can be most appreciated by those who have been exposed to Filipino and Filipino-American culture. If you're willing to see past the obvious shortcomings, there is a lot of depth in the portrayal of adapting to American culture, perceptions by Filipinos of other Americans, the ups and down of family relations and family roles... and some pretty thoughtful reflection on the political climate ""back home"". No, it might not win any Oscars, but my wife (who is not Filipino) and I thoroughly enjoyed the film."
2,Adobo was undercooked.,"Ok, I was excited for someone in the Philippines to venture into this realm of cinema, the conflicting struggles of adjusting to America, while trying to keep our native culture. Now, to me, that sounds like a very, very emotional movie. I couldn't get passed the horrible acting, I mean, maybe it would have been more intense if the whole movie was Tagalog.The plot really falls short. It's out of focus and doesn't leave for any character development except for Tere's character. Also, to just add in political and religious dialogue so randomly abrupt doesn't even give any of the issues substance at all. This movie had so much more potential to really push the limits of filipino upbringing in the US, American assimiliation, and the portrayal of deep internal conflicts to balance these two cultures.Unlike the people in the movie, I thought the adobo was really overated."
1,* out ***** and that a 1 out of 5.,"Aristottle Marson from San Francisco, I don't understand why Mr. Dorsey had anything to do with your movie review. Frankly, the movie is bland and like most reviews, melodramatic like soap. I am half Filipino but I still didn't like the movie because the acting was superficial, the story-less than mediocre, the ending-however convenient was also inept. I could go on and on. I should keep my mouth shut as I would probably get under attack by other Filipinos and their wrong sense of (film) patriotism. It's in our culture. HAHA!"
4,Good except for the gear noise,"The reception and sound are good for a portable. This may be the only windup radio which does not have rechargable batteries. Rechargable batteries give longer playing time but need to be replaced eventually.My only complaint is the gear noise. The sound is constantly annoying unless the volume is turned up more than halfway.Most modern gadgets are marvels of miniaturization compared with this radio. The Freeplay FPR2SC in clear plastic resembles the electronics kits sold as education toys, but that is part of its appeal.Other than the gear noise, the design is good in general if bulk is not a consideration. The gears hunt with a period of about 1 second. The gears almost stop with each cycle. The grating noise comes when the gears spin fast. The belt wheels are wobbely, but don not appear to be the cause of the hunting. The hunting is likely due to the electrical generator control."
2,Works fine -- until it stops working,"I bought two of these hoping to save some energy. After five months, one radio would work using only the ac adaptor. Nothing would happen if I cranked it or put it in the sun. Since it was still under warranty, I sent it back to Freeplay. They never answered. The second radio lasted fifteen months. ..."
4,A Sending of Dragons,"I loved this trilogy. The first book was great. The second book was not quite as good as the first, but still a good read. The third was the same as the second. I think that a lot of questions were left unanswered in A Sending of Dragons, and there wasn't much of a resolution. I still recomend it as a great read."
1,Pathetic,"The first book Dragons Blood,was great. The second book, Hearts blood, was allright though i got tired of the continually repeating ""I am a man"" theme. But this third one is the worst. How can Jane YOlen have fallen so far!? The end they fear is near and there is no real resolution to the story, this could have used ten or fifteen more drafts before it was set loose."
3,It was just okay,"I read DRAGON'S BLOOD (book 1 in this series) a few years ago, having no idea it was the first book in a trilogy. It was a jewel of a book, even for an adult. However, I did not feel that way about either of the subsequent books. They were okay, but they did not give me that tingly feeling the first one did. The worst part about this book is that it sort ends with a lot of loose ends not tied up, making me expect a fourth book (which doesn't exist). I'd say buy A SENDING OF DRAGONS used, if you have read the first two books, and don't bother if you haven't."
1,This book just plain ....,"This trilogy just got worse as time went on. The first one was Amazing, and recommend it to everyone. The second was ok, and recommend it to the people who read the first one. But this one, well, i recommend this one going straight into the trash bin. Nobody should torture themselves by reading the dribble that is written in those pages. It has nohting to do with the first one. I think it is about time that Jane Yolen seriously considers a major career change."
4,"Definitely worth a read, especially for Yolen fans","The third in the trilogy, this book is decidedly different, taking place entirely in the wilderness and away from society, and inside the minds of Akki and Jakkin. They can now communicate without speech, with pictures and emotions and colors. It is very fantastical and vivid, at points exciting and touching. I liked it quite a bit, but I'd read the first two books before this one."
1,Huge dissapointment,"I really liked the first book, Dragons Blood, and the second one, Hearts Blood, was all right, but this one was pathetic.It starts off all right but all the time in the subteraenean society just reeked, i expected a whole lot more than this!"
5,Gotta read it!!!!!,Jane Yolens Sending of Dragons was incredible. Jakkin and Akki are stuck in the damp tunnels of a huge cave. They stumble across cave people bloodier than the cell wardens. They have to find a way out before the cave people can catch them. You've GOTTA READ IT!!!!!!
2,Anyone interested in the rest of my bottle?,Took it consistently for a month then ran out. Didn't lose a single damn pound. Didn't lose any stress. Nothing. Nada. Luckily it was cheap. Another gimmick that didn't work.
3,...but its only vitamins!,People obviously let their imaginations get away from logic. READ the ingredients! It's ONLY vitamins!
2,Lost weight but horrible side effects,"I started taking this last Friday as directed on the package...two caplets three times a day. The first day I felt really sick to my stomach and really bloated and gassy. I also had diarrhea. It was also difficult to sleep. The second day the gassiness was still there but not as bad but I started to get really bad dizzy spells. The third day it was the same thing, but I woke up with three HUGE pimples on my face. Not normal little pimples these are enormous and very painful. I decided to continue as I was losing weight, but I took only one caplet three times a day - so cut my dosage in half. The fourth day I found another huge pimple on my neck and decided to stop taking the drug. I lost 4 pounds in the three days I took it but seriously I would rather just diet and exercise more than deal with the acne and bloated feeling. I did feel more calm and relaxed but again, the side effects aren't worth it to me."
1,Terrible Experience,"I'm pre-menopausal, so I was looking for a product to help reduce my newly acquired belly fat. I've always been very thin until recently. After taking this product for two weeks, I lost no belly fat, but I did develop huge cyst-like bumps on my back and forehead. I also suddenly became very tired, even though I wasn't sleeping soundly. I took the medicine exactly as prescribed. I think this is dangerous medicine and I do not recommend it. I'm 45 and I'm still trying to deal with the cystic acne on my back. I have never had acne until now, even as a teenager. Hopefully, my fatigue and acne will subside soon, but I'm still trying to recover from this horrible experience."
1,Did not work for me,"I was trying to find a weight loss supplement to go with my workouts and decided to try Relacore. I took 2 capsules 3 times a day and the only change i noticed was that my urine was bright yellow.My mother, who does not work out, has also tried it and didn't notice a change except she has to go to the bathroom (#2) A LOT more often."
2,Don't like it....,I just stopped taking my bottle of Relacore mid way through. This product did help in decreasing my appetitie BUT it causes acne and gives me horrible headaches...not migraines...but bad headaches none the less. I'll get a bump on my face every once in a while but I REALLY noticed a difference in my skin and the extra bumps I was getting. The bumps are small and red and all over my forehead. I even got some on my neck. It was weird. I couldn't figure out what was going on until I read some of the feedback/reviews on this product.
3,Sleepy but Hopeful,"I've been taking this for about a week now, and whenever I take it, I feel buzzed or very relaxed. Then again- I do have a severe anxiety disorder which it seems to calm. No weight loss yet- but I'm hopeful.I'm taking this product with BIOPRENE, a black pepper fruit extract that almost tripples the effect of any pill such as this.Ex: I was taking breat success, and after two months I went from a B cup to a C cup. I'm hoping bioprene will do something similar with this diet pill to get rid of my excess belly flab."
1,Made me VERY hungry!,"This product made me very hungry, I couldn't stop eating after one pill! My stomach was growling, all day after one pill. Not recommended..."
2,If you don't mind acne.....,"This product was sworn to be great for me by a co-worker and she was right. Yes it helps to reduce stress which leads to a flatter tummy BUT....read the fine print. Side affect is acne. I've always had clear skin but after 2 weeks of Relacore...I had acne on my face, shoulders and back. It's the kind of pimples that are red and sore. After realizing that no shower products helped I stopped taking Relacore and guess what...no more acne. Reading other reviews I'm not alone in this.As I said good product if you don't mind the effects."
1,No more weight loss products for me!,"I took the pills as directed, but I felt hungry all the time. I watched what I ate and how much, but it made me hungry and so I would eat or munch on snacks. And yes, my urine was also bright yellow too! I've decided never to try another weight loss product again!!!!! None of those products work-you gain weight instead of lose weight!!!!!"
4,Seems to be working.,"I don't take the product as directed because then I would have to take nine pills a day, and times are tough. But the two or three pills I take a day are enough to keep me in a nicely pleasant mood because of the Vitamin B, and I think the fat is melting off my abdomen, anyway."
4,GOOD PRODUCT,"I took this product along with another supplement that contained hoodia, green tea and chromium. Between the two, that covered appetite suppression, glucose levels, energy and stress. This product is fantastic and I lost 17 lbs. in about 2 months with a slightly stricter diet (still had creamer & real sugar in my coffee but not too many carbs and barely any fat) and only exercised 2 times a week."
3,Didn't work,"I followed the directions, cut my fat and carb intake, took a 30 minute brisk walk each day and lost nothing. I kept this up for two months and have had no results.I gave it three stars just because I had to give it something. I don't want to exactly say it was all Relacore that failed. It could be just me becuase I have tried just about every diet pill and ""buy our food"" diet without any success. I have also spent money on gyms with very little success.As far as taking the Relacore, I felt no side effects. No jitters, thirst, hunger, gas or other bowel problems."
2,relacore effectiveness,"Relacore is not effective as I expect it would be. It need's to be coupled by exercise and diet. So, I stop taking and I just exercise and do some diet modification."
1,Sleepy,I used Relacore for one week.....it didn't work the only thing it helped with was sleeping. The bottle says take one with each meal and I did by 3pm daily I was fighting to keep my eyes open. If you need help sleeping this is one too take. Also I put on 3 pounds.
4,Udi's,"Although this is a great product, beware....... I thought all Udi's was Gluten Free. I ordered 6 packages of this to find out it is not GL. They have two different types. One line that is certified GF and one that is not. Unfortunately I bought the wrong one! Make sure you read the label to be 100% sure it's gluten free."
1,Boring and non-inspirational,"oh my god! is this boring!!! Donna Hug just demonstrates a bit from everything!""Beginners"" mean obviously kindergarden level. Donnas monotonous voice brings me to a yawning and the pictures are not motivating at all! I am a multimedia freak and i have learned a lot from teaching videos and DVDs, but this video is just a simple demo of different techniques on a surface level!this is my worst purchase from AMAZON ever!Stay away from that video and get the books from Brenda Hoddinott instead, which are a lot better, fascinating and motivating alike!If you like Multimedia Teaching, do a search for Larry Gluck"
2,"Great music, but poor sound quality","Although these are 10 classic songs, the sound quality on this CD is terrible with surface noise, rechanneled sound and everything else that prevents me from rating this collection 5 stars which I would have given this CD if the sound quality problems weren't there. This is unfortunately the only CD that is available of his early recordings though and as a result I'm keeping it for now. Too bad that there are no decent CD copies of ""Bumming Around"" as other CD's use a re-recording of it and these songs are the 4 Star recordings. I was excited to see a CD of his early recordings available so I took a chance and bought it and I got stung. I'm rating it 1 star for the sound quality and a bonus star for the great music on it a total of 2 stars. Avoid this collection and try and find vinyl with better sound quality than this CD."
4,a nice cutter,"This doughnut cutter was a huge help for me. Though it may seem small at only three inches in diameter, it is actually well suited to doughnut-making--they plump up quite a bit in the hot oil. It was easy to use--much easier than trying to cut donuts freehand--and a snap to clean off. The only issue I had was the inner blade, the part that cuts the hole. It wasn't flush with the outer blade, so it would only make a circular outline where the hole should be. I had to insert a turkey skewer into the top of the cutter in order to remove the excess dough from the center. I suppose that this would be helpful for making filled doughnuts, and the use of this cutter sped up the process nonetheless. It's a great kitchen tool to have."
2,no holes,The outside ring works well but the inside ring leaves an incomplete cut. It appears that the two rings are not at the same level leaving no way that the inside ring can make contact with the cutting surface. I am cutting the inside ring with a separate modified piece of metal.
2,Emulate their use of materials but not their compositions,"This book has pros and cons.Pros:There are many many collages illustrated in this book.The collages are made with a suprising variety of materials, many of which I had never seen, or never considered using in a collage. The combinations of varied elements give the collages rich texture.The photos of the projects are high quality.A few of the collages are beautiful.The collages contain interesting use of overlapping.Cons:Most of the collages have the same kind of layout - casually arranged elements strewn at odd angles with lots of overlapping.In most of the compositions, the intesting mix of textures doesn't quite compensate for lack of a strong center of interest."
1,Not what expected!,"This toy is not what I expected it to be. I was hoping for the motorized Thomas train that follows the tracks. Despite what another review said, this doesn't do that. All they do is stamp. Thomas makes railroad tracks but doesn't actually move at all. Not worth the money in my opinion."
2,Ouch!,"I'd like to point out that the good reviews for this ring weren't from the person who actually wears this ring. The feet are VERY sharp and I have also have scars from her feet and forget trying to get into your pocket wearing it. I tried wearing the fairy in both directions but now just have scars in two places on my finger. Don't get me wrong, I loved this ring! It's super cute but I'm not sure it's worth the injury. I ended up filing down her feet and that seems to have helped for now."
5,Great purchase!,"I ordered this item for my wife who is a fairy-aholic. Previous reviews warned it was sharp (this is true, thus wouldn't recommend for youngsters). My wife LOVED it!! Will be purchasing mathcing necklace and earings soon."
1,dangerous,"I love fairies so when I saw this ring I had to have it. That was until I went to use the restroom, was pulling my pants back up and the feet <which are pointy as daggers> ripped about a 3 in gash across my knee. Here I am at work, trying to sop up the blood and get back to my desk. I gave the ring away after that, but I have a nice scar to show for it!"
2,none,"I bought this ring, I thought it was pretty, until I got it home. They should inform you that the feet of the fairy are like a dagger! I have multiple scars on my finger where its gouged me, and I have a 3 inch scar up my knee where the feet ripped thru my pants and into my knee! I had it in my pocket so I could use the restroom. I was going to send it back but I dont know the info was, so I left it on my desk at work hoping someone would steal it, no luck so far."
1,Brakes Easy!,"The item is not broken but the 2 things that hold the frame together went missing and now is worthless, I have no idea what happened to those 2 pieces and not idea where to get them at? Dont bother buying i regret it so much for spending on something i never got to use."
1,DOA,Some batteries were actually dead on arrival. Would not even power up my digital camera fresh out of the pack. Pass on these.
1,Batteries don't last,"Very disappointed in these batteries. I use them in a Canon camera for flash photography. The number of photos and flashes are way less than half what I would expect from private brands at CVS, Costco, or other stores. I would not buy these again."
2,Short lived batteries,These batteries didn't last as long as norman name brand batteries. I was dissappointed.
1,Ultrasuck,"I bought a bunch of these batteries a while back and as I go through them I'm finding that they're all dead. The expiration date on the bottom of the battery says ""good till 2013"" (I'm writing this at the beginning of 2010) unfortunately that's not the case. Spend a little extra money and get yourself a quality product."
3,Decent,"I did enjoy this cd a bit, but found it very repetitive. But it sure beats the average metal band of today. And the main riff in ""scar spangled banner"" is very cool, but gets repetitive. So in short, start out your Exodus collection with Bonded by Blood or Fabulous Disaster. Starting with this one won't make a great impression on what the band is capable of."
3,Bad Vocals and repetative riffs,"The album is good but, it isn't very good. In other words it's mediocre. For one thing the verse riffs are to repetative. How bout adding a bend or slide to the guitar to vary the riff?. The solos are good but, not at all original and not to mention very predictable as they follow the typical 80's formula of going through two Chorus's until running the solo. The vocals are terrible, the voice sounds mousy and and high pitched.This album has its moments but, nothing is outstanding. THe only reason I entertained listening to this album is because the current metal scene is much worse then what present day Exodus has to offer. I guess I'll go back to listening to my old school metallica and slayer albums in order to get some musical satisfaction."
1,not new,CD was not new. I paid for a new one. but it seems fine but there is some scatches on it and 1 pretty big one. but it seems fine. but not new like I paid for.
4,It is produced by Andy Sneap,"EXODUS went after the best metal producer around, Andy Sneap, and the result was this great album."
5,Album of the year!!!!,"This album kicks ass! Vocal and guitar riffs are amazing. THE BLACKLIST is best song so powerful and revengeful. Rest also will blow you away SHROUD OF URINE, WAR IS MY SHEPPARD, SEALED WITH A FIST, FORWARD MARCH AND AC/DC'S DIRTY DEEDS. One of best albums of 21st century."
5,Hey - Where's the 6-Star Rating???,"All bow down and worship the masterpiece that Exodus has layed upon the metal masses. In a time of wimpy, pathetic, mallcore, rap-wannabe wussy-bands, Exodus unleashes an INSTANT CLASSIC to rip the hair off your balls and slap your mother in the face. This is the first CD I've given a 5-star rating and it really deserves a 6!!!This is the greatest piece of musical mayhem that has been released in the past 3 years. Metallica should all be locked up in a room and forced to listen to this CD, 24 hours straight for an entire year and then released and told they have one more chance to get it right before being castrated and forced to lip-synch with Ashley Simpson."
4,Molten Metal,"First off, this is a great metal CD. Brutal riffs, killer vocals, everything that makes a metal album great. I have been a fan of Exodus for close to 20 years and this CD is among their best IMO. It is a riff fest. Zet is awesome, Holt and Hunolt-awesome, drums-awesome. An excellent disc I will be banging my head to for a long time."
4,the return of EXODUS!!,"i wasnt expecting anything too groundbreaking here,as thrash metal as a genre is for the most part quite dated (if not outright dead).This disc proved to be,however,quite enjoyable!very solid from start to finish.made me feel nostalgic for that time and place(bay area thrash).the modern production value,though,puts it in the here-and-now while keeping true to their sound.a pleasant surprise!!"
5,Thrash Metal is back,"Tempo Of the Damned is a must have for any Exodus fan and will blow u away from 1st track to the last track cuz the cd shredds all the way thru. But the Exodus bunch have had some lineup changes since this cd starting with vocals, drums and recently lead guitar I know that Paul Bostaph(Slayer) has joined on the Exodus wagon and now Lee Altus to fill the lead spot not sure who the singer is but they have a new cd coming out Oct.4th Shovel Headed Kill Machine and with the new lineup I bet still shredds and out on a world tour starting Oct.2 to support the new cd"
1,Misleading,"This is not a live album, but studio tracks dubbed with a fake live audience. No wonder this product has been discontinued. The engineers did a poor job of dubbing the so called live audience."
1,"worst language book ever, by inexeprienced teachers despite their supposed experience","This is a very bad book. There is no communicative context to any of the lessons at all. All vocabulary seems to be introduced randomly. Not around real contextulized conversations. There is little or no spirling of material/vocabulary so that one do not build their skills on past lessons. There is way too much English explanations, when they could have used the space for more communicative conversations and introduction to real language. It is a good book if your interesteed in Turkish grammar, but knowing grammar does not translate into being able to communicate. How many of us can think of grammar rules and speak at the same time. Do not buy this book."
3,SOME HELP LEARNING TURKISH,"I JUST ORDERED THIS BOOK TO HELP ME RELEARN TURKISH, MY MOM IS TURKISH AND WE JUST CAME BACK FROM TRIP THIS SUMMER. I WISH I TRIED TO LEARN IT BEFORE I WENT, SINCE IT HAD BEEN YEARS SINCE I WAS THERE. ONE THING THAT MAY HELP EVERYONE THAT IS MISSING THE CD'S IS TO WATCH SOME TV SHOWS. IF YOU GO ONTO YOU TUBE AND SEARCH FOR HEPSI BIR, THIS IS A TV SHOW THAT HAS 30-40 EPISODES OF A TURKISH POP GROUP WHO IS REALLY BIG OVER THERE. IVE BEEN LEARNING FROM WATCHING THE SHOW, YOU GET TO HEAR THE CONVERSATION AND SEE THE SITUATION SO IT MAY HELP EVERYONE."
4,Great companion for Rosetta Stone Course,"I purchased Rosetta Stone Course for Turkish and Spanish but felt that Rosetta needed a grammar book. Teach Yourself TurkishComplete Course filled the gap for me. I dont use the CD much because I like the way Rosetta Stone gives pronunciations. My husband who already speaks Turkish likes the CD so he can brush up on what he already knows. I also like that each chapter has practical everyday signs, menus etc that you will see when visiting Turkey."
3,Not what I thought,I ordered this item hastily. It is interesting but the price is kind of high for what is contained within the pages. Good story about finding Jesus Christ! Christ is King!
4,Christmas novel,I love reading. And expecial Christmas novels over the winter holidays. I really enjoyed this book and encorage other readers to read it.
1,Please cancel,Tried to cancel this order but was unable to do it online Cancel cancel cancel cancel please cancel this order
2,"easy to understand, but not exciting to read","My daughter had to read this book for a class, and she says it is very easy to understand if you need a basic introduction to disability, but overally it is pretty easy to put down. The language and style make it not as interesting and enticing as she would have wished."
1,Which Restaurant ?,I have tried & or studied this entire book . Not one of the recipes was anything like what I have experieced at the many chinese restaurants I have patronized across this country .This is one of two cookbooks that I have ever gotten rid of in my life.
3,"The Disappearing Island Book ""Review""",This book had a very interesting plot. It also was illustrated very well. The book lost my attention. You could use the book to teach children about erosion. The book seemed to be very monotone and was hard to connect with. I would not choose this book to read to my class because it has no character deapth beyond the fact of the eroding island.
2,Nothing special about this book - too many cruise tours,"There is really not much special about this book. If you are looking for a more detailed description of the ships and tours being than what you get from the cruise lines, it may meet your needs. But if you're looking for ""off the beaten path"" tours and tips, there isn't much there."
5,Excellent textbook,"This book does exactly what it says it does... challenges everyday conventional wisdom such as ""you get what you pay for"", in an easy-to-read format, and all important keywords within the text are in bold, with an additional box with the word and definition."
4,Pleasing,I found this CD very pleasing to listen to.. but a bit expensive.. and I found that I really like Patrizio Buanne's version a little more..on some of the songs done by both of these gifted singers....but I love the classical voice...and will enjoy what this CD does to my ears...Differnces are what makes the world go round and it is still a beautiful piece of music...we are so fortunate to be living when music is really expanding and the classic singer and the crooner can sing the same songs and give us all a different but wonderful experience...where have we all been for so many years waiting for these talented singers to come along?...or have they found us a starving public waiting for real music real singing to come and bring musical joy to our lives...I am glad I own this CD.
1,There isn't a rating low enough...,"This book was horrible. I got it from a friend who didn't finish it, and now I know why. I read about half, skimmed the rest, stopped and read when I saw somebody was getting peed on, decided I could have lived the rest of my life quite nicely NOT having read that, and then fast forwarded to the end. I'm sure I missed a lot of plot by not reading the last half, but at least my soul didn't suffer. The writing is slow, plodding, methodical, and doesn't sound or feel like the voice of a troubled adolescent, full of rage, or even ambivalence. The sex is vulgar and coarse, but when it gets to the actual sexual material, there's no processing of feelings or sensations; perhaps that is the only part that seems like it could come from a teenage boy. I've read a lot of repulsive or vulgar material that was fascinating, like, ""Ecstasy"" and ""Fox Girl."" This book simply didn't interest me on any level."
4,Disturbing but fascinating,"There are two adversaries in the war being fought here: Tom, the narrator, allied with his violent rebelliousness, and his older sister, Jessie, who is having sex with their father (at her instigation). Caught in the middle are their mother, and the new baby, and the local biker scumbags in the small Cornish town to which they have moved from the train wreck of London. Jessie, who is carnality personified, insists there must be nothing she would not do, while Tom, who hates his sister and adores her in equal measure, isn't nearly the bad boy he wants to be -- or thinks he ought to be. Stuart's prose is intensely vivid and impossible to glide over, no matter how uncomfortable you become at some of the scenes he paints. A book that is meant to be disturbing and succeeds. ""Brilliant,"" as Jessie would say."
2,Off the mark on a very important subject!,I feel the author missed his chance to explore the subject of incest from the child's perspective.While casting most of the blame on the child; it never explains the WHY. I feel the novel was exploitive and needn't have been; since the subject itself always is. There was a lack of clarity in regard to the child's motivation in manipulating the people closest to her in such a perverse way. The book left alot of unanswered questions and I had an overall feeling of sadness after reading it. The child was again victimized; only this time by the author.
1,Reminded me of Creative Writing Class,"...back in the day. How this book received much acclaim is beyond me. Perhaps because of the hoopla surrounding the Whitbread prize? It's not so much that the subject matter is distasteful (which it is, but so was Lolita, and that was a damn good book), but the story line plods along (I did lots of skim reading, and don't think I missed much) and Jessie's motivations, in the end, are ridiculous. The only thing that kept me going was my desire to know how her brain worked, however warped...that never happened. A friend moving overseas gave me all her books, this one included. Thank God I didn't spend money on it...not worth a cent."
4,206 Underground at its finest!,"Back in the City Where it Rains All the Time aka Seattle, this album was the only thing you heard during the 93-94 era. Taking Ends gives a peak into the true Seattle hip-hop vibe not the bamber booty shake you hear coming from sir-mix-a-lot. The beats are laid back and the lyrics are tight. I think that if this group wasn't on D-Shot's label they would have really made a name for themselves. They also have the tightest song on the D-Shot ""Boss Ballin'"" Album, ""Hoes [Be Trippin]"""
3,This cd shows good command of lyrical content.,"This cd shows good lyrical content and the beats are hittin' on more than a few tracks. The overall perception I get on this cd is that this group is bringin' the ""real"" to everyone who likes hip-hop."
3,Expected a little more,"When the first topic you look up isn't in the book at all, it's already disappointing. I was eager to get this book because one of my sugar gliders had incurred a tail injury. The word ""tail"" isn't in the indexes at all, except for bobbing dogs. Since most animals can easily substain tail injuries (caught in doors, stepped on, bitten by another animal), it seems quite an oversight not to cover the topic at all. Seems a lot of ""vet"" books are bantering the topic ""sugar gliders"" in their listed coverage since the resources are still scare. This book has only a couple pages of general info. If you're looking for complete glider care, better to go with MacPherson's 'Suger Gliders: Everything about (etc)' from Barrons. Complete Home Vet is OK as a general reference, but if you're serious, I'd go for a more expensive real emergency / veterinary care book. CHECK INSIDE THE BOOK CONTENTS/INDEXES to be sure your pet category is adequately covered. It'll save money and disappointment."
4,"Complex issues, disturbing insights, but very readable","There are always stereotypes to be stripped down, aren't there?Rekdal's themes (race, how Americans are perceived overseas, how Americans perceive each other) make you think, but her writing won't make you struggle. Her essays, built around episodes of her life, are sad, funny, entertaining and insightful.An excellent book. Highly recommended. I wish I could teach a course called ""Race in America"" just so I could get more people to read this book."
5,best ever,"I've had the rare privelage of seeing Goob and the Peas live in Kent,Oh at this horrible bar called Ozzie's. The crowd was thin, then the band of the day was Dink. I've been a really big fan since '93, but they've been around much longer. This particular album surpasses their first album ""Goober and the Peas."" All the songs are catchy. I often find myself plaing the track ""Neighbors"" when the white trash who surround me now in Ravenna, OH play ""Dream On"" for the four-hundreth time in a row. Since I am also a vegetarian, I like the song ""Killing is Bad,"" a sort of reflection on the ""P.C."" trend of 1994. Goober and the Peas toungue-in-cheek, but oddly true-to-life lyrics make this album a must for any party or home alone moment."
3,Iron Man 2 (1 disc - blue ray),"This disc's AV quality matches the Iron Man 1, but I like the first movie better. Both Iron man 1 & 2 are choice to show off on hugh front projection screen for sure. The reduced selling price is acceptable."
2,Tedious,"Way, too much goofy dialog kept me from enjoying this very much...I'll not be a candidate for IM 3 when it comes out."
4,Good Deal,"This was offered at a good price, especially since it was a blue ray package. I've already viewed it twice."
4,Action! Action! Action!,"Great movie, though the plot seemed a little thin. From a comic book reader / individual that loves fictional movies that have a flair for a lot of action, this movie didn't disappoint."
4,"Great action flick, bad batch of disks?","I liked the movie - it was a great action flick. All the reviewers bashing the 'science', martial arts, dialogue, etc... lighten up! It's a movie made to entertain us plain and simple. That being said, I purchased this bluray (3 pack version w/ bluray, DVD, and digital copy) and the bluray had 2 'blips' in it where it would freeze, then continue playing after a second or 2. Haven't tried the DVD or digital copy yet. My sister purchased hers from walmart and hers froze up completely and would not play past the 'race in Moracco' scene at all. Sister said wal-mart customer service rep told her quite a few of them had been returned for the same reason (freezing). Perhaps there was a bad batch of blurays sent out? I have returned for a replacement - not Amazon's fault."
4,Lots of action and there is a story as well!,"Lots of action and the Black Widow gymnastics were great. Tony Stark character a bit over-the-top, but well acted. Story line surprisingly engaging."
3,not as great as the first,too much going on and not enough action in the sequel. Iron man was made to look like a doofus.
4,Better than the first?,It is not often that sequals are as good or better than the first movie. This one does a great job other than some of the CG is a bit cheesy. Great use of 2 hours of your time.
3,Action galore,"The special effects are incredible. Robert Downey and Scarlett Johansson were great. It just wasn't as good as the first installment, though."
5,Fun Action Movie for the Familhy,"I have a 4 and 6 year old who thought this movie was kind of scary and did not make it to the end. That being said, my kids are pretty sheltered against violent movies and games and I knew there was a good chance that they would think that it is too scary... My husband who is not a fan of special effects and action type movies found himself laughing and totally enjoying the movie. That says a lot as he is really into more character based movies. Robert Downey Jr. is perfect as the playboy turned super hero! One of the best movies out of the Marvel franchise. I loved Iron Man (1) and hoped that the sequel would be equally as good. This may be a tad better than the first one!!"
4,"Slightly flawed but very entertaining , does what it should well","Hearing about the (implied) problems the director had with the people from Marvel, who own the rights to the character, one realises we were lucky this film is as good as it is. It is a shame when a film (Iron Man) whose success was uncertain and which was a gamble, but which turned out to be very profitable can be a curse. Everyone involved wants to repeat the success, especially the financial return, but at what cost?I will always be glad we got the first film, which I feel is a classic. I just hope things don't get worse with Iron Man 3 - a lot of us know how sequel quality seems to go downhill, yet we still support them and make up the audience for them - strange, isn't it?"
5,Great DVD,"While Iron Man 2 is nowhere as good as the first one (my favorite movie), it is still a very fun movie. The blu-ray is a great deal too and the picture is really incredible. The special features also make the blu-ray a much better buy than the normal one."
3,Iron Man or Transformer?,"This sequel started out weird with Tony Stark drunk, funky, carelessness. Wasn't particularly engaging until 1/3 way into the story. Action is cool and blu-ray picture is sharp. The audio decoded has decent surround balance.Toward the end, the action certainly became louder if you had the sound up high already. It was our first time seeing the movie on blu-ray, and the sequence on Full HD (1080p) plasma display did not disappoint. However, we did get the feeling of transformer with so many robots and iron suits that can transform..All in all,not much depth to the story. Just good action flick for home collectors to justify the extra money you poured in to your HDTV flat panel with higher frequency, as well as your surround speaker. Although I still think Transformer movies and Star Trek had much better surround sound decoding..."
4,Fairly enjoyable sequel,"I don't read the Iron Man comic series, so I can't compare the canon in the comic and this movie, so my review is based solely on my impression of the film itself and what little I do know of the Marvel and Iron Man universe.The visuals and action was sweet. The fight scenes were thrilling. Ivan Vanko was played well and I liked the actor chosen for the role. The story was enjoyable and believable, with convincing villains and two-faced politicians. I enjoyed Iron Man 1 more than I did this, but the second installment of this film is a definite solid movie and more than worthy of four stars."
2,Lame,"I have to admit I don't want to spend a lot of time on this review just like the producers didn't want to spend a lot of time on making sure someone was writing a decent story for this movie. Special effects only get you so far. The first one was way better, and the G4 Iron Man cartoons are done with much more care than this movie."
2,Couldn't wait for it to be over,"I love sci-fi of every kind. However, this film shows that bad screenplay and acting will still make you want to bolt for the door. Robert Downey Jr. was just hideous as a self-absorbed jerk through the whole movie. The movie was about his excesses more than about the Iron Man. Sam Rockwell was painful to watch. Mickey Rourke was the one person to see in this film. Everyone else was just making a paycheck."
3,Ehhh...Not Awful...But...,"Plenty of action. Plenty of drama, partying, flirting. But it lacked the heart of the first film (pardon the pun) and felt more choppy and predictable. There was one very satisfying relational moment, but other than that, I felt pretty indifferent and glad I didn't hand over the moulah to see it in the theater. I'd suggest trying before buying."
2,What happened?,Iron man 2 sucked IMO...The story was decent and I wanted to see a new villain that's not dressed as another Ironman.
2,Meh..,This one just drug on and on... The best part of the movie was the last 15 minutes and the first 15.
2,Bluray product Iron Man 2,"Iron Man 2 3 disk combo, this review is on the disks quality not the movie: Package arrived fine, intact. The regular DVD played fine. The Blu-ray disk was defective, it would stop mid-play throughout the movie. I must have gotten a bad-lot blu-ray disk. Very annoying and disappointed :-("
3,Not As Good As The First One,"The movie is at best 3 stars, falls below the 1st Iron Man.Also the packaging indicates that there are 3 discs, but in actuality only 2.A bit of deception here, the standard DVD and Digital copy are on 1 disc."
1,"Crash, Smash, ZZZzzzzz","This sequel had about as much personality as my kitchen blender. Why the meaningless cameo by Samuel Jackson? Scarlett Johansson walks in and out, except for a nice bout throwing men around like tenpins. Gwyneth Paltrow adds a little much-needed humanity, and Robert Downey might just as well have worn his iron suit throughout. There is no difference. Same for Don Cheadle. Mickey Rourke's sly Russian physicist is appealing, which is all I can say about the film AND the cast."
1,Movie Good Amazon Prime Streaming the pits,No way to review the movie but as far as streaming from prime I could never get my computer to connect so no clue about the movie.
1,Poor story and dialogue,"Nobody watches action films for dialogue, but it has to have a solid story and decent dialogue to go with it. That's what made movies like Bourne Identity so great."
4,Overhype and overscore...,Everyhero gets a sidekick except Penny isn't the sidekick but the victim of poor writing and don't get me started on Scarlett Johanssen lines...bummer I thought this would be good the next one is coming and well...I might wait till it is available on Amazon.
2,Another case of trying to put too much into one movie,"I can handle the villians, but Black Widow seems out of place since shes only there for the Avengers setup. A so so sequel that should have at least passed on the whole ""War Machine"" subplot."
2,"Good quality disc, rubbish film","I actually really enjoyed the first film apart from the final act that seemed rushed and wasted. This sequel while very high quality (esp on bd) visually contains a convoluted plot, rubbish characters and a didssapointing tale. There is nothing I actually liked in this sequel which was a great shame."
2,Iron Man 2 Review,Not as good as the first Iron Man. Iron Man 2 was totally predictable from beginning to the end with just okay special effects. Robert Downey Jr. is the perfect choice for the playing Iron Man character. I should have rented the movie before I purchased it.
3,I was expecting more...unfortunately.,"Not a bad movie, but no means a good one. While the first film was superior in everything, from sound to effects and more importantly, story. This sequel failed to deliver the goods the first promised. Overall a decent enough film with a few gosh wow scenes and decent enough acting by a good cast mixed with some humerous moments allowed this film to not be completely DOA but it lacks the freshness the first one had. Better luck next time guys."
1,Blu-Ray won't play on Sony Blu-Ray players,I am returning the 2nd Iron Man 2 Blu-Ray 3 disc set because the Blu-Ray disc will not play on a Sony Blu=Ray disc player. When you press select for any of the play menu items you get the disclaimers and then the player shuts down and restarts. The player will play any other Blu-Ray including new releases like Robin Hood.What gives Paramount?
1,iron man ?????,I REMEMBER SEEING THIS IN THE THEATER LAST YEAR. I WAS EXPECTING THE SAMEEXCITEMENT WITH THE BLUEEEERAY. THE COPY I RECEIVED WAS DEFECTIVE. I AM SENDING IT BACK.
1,Childish,"I absolutely LOVED Iron Man One, one of the best movies I've seen - couldn't wait to buy Iron Man 2. Even bought the Blu Ray edition.. Had a party to watch it.... almost everybody left. I want my money back. What a rip... The dialogue was horrible, too long, childish, made no sense. The plot could've been great if carried out, but Mickey Rourke was horrible and Gwyneth Paltrow, a CEO, come on. A few of the scenes were good but the writing was so ridiculous, like I said, everybody I invited over left the room except for me and I regretted watching it to the end... I sure hope there is NOT an Iron Man 3, or if there is, get some new writers. When are people going to stop supporting these Hollywood nut cases and quit being taken as suckers, me being one of them."
3,Not as good as first one,"Seems like less action & more talk than the first one. Mickey Rourke was good though. Worth watching, but not the beat super hero flick."
4,Jon Favreau accomplishes a difficult and thankless task with style and aplomb in continuing this franchise,"Pretty darn good. Functions reasonably well as a stand alone film. Functions very well as a continuation of the build toward the Avengers movie. Avoids the trap of multiplying villains with each sequel. Continues adding depth (though not tremendous depth) to all of the characters. Jon Favreau accomplishes a difficult and thankless task with style and aplomb in continuing this franchise. And I admire his geek-knowledge foresight in giving himself a tiny part in IM1 as the character who eventually marries Gwyneth Paltrow's character. Smooth, buddy, smooth."
5,A cool sequel,"Although perhaps not as great as the original, 2009s IronMan 2 does have its moments (Whiplash attacking Tony Stark during the racing event in Monaco, the fight between War Machine and IronMan). Robert Downey Jr is back, and brings even more depth and playful mischief to his characterization of Stark/IronMan, and some pathos too as he realizes that the chest plate he wears to save his life is slowly killing him and must find a new element to save his life or else. Mickey Rourke is cast as Ivan Vanko/Whiplash and makes a formidable villian, and Don Cheadle is here as James Rhodes/War Machine, and I must say hes even better than Terrance Howard from the first movie, who virtually had nothing to do but stand around and look annoyed as he tried to rein our hero in, lol. A fun adventure."
3,Numerous audio dropouts on the BluRay disk,"The video quality is great, but I experienced numerous random audio dropouts on the Blu Ray disk. There are reports on various A/V websites of this (avsforum has several). It appears to affect Blu Ray players from different manufacturers, but the consensus (so far) seems to be it will require firmware updates - the reviewers don't blame the disk mastering at this time."
2,Poor Follow Up to a Great Movie,"We loved Iron Man! We thought Iron Man 2 had a weak story line with so - so characters. Although the Black Widow is introduced as a character in this movie - there is nothing to tell you who she is or what her history is. The story did not set up the villin (M. Rouke). Although he plays a good 'bad guy' in other movies, you did not know his story other than a few second of something about father-vs-father. Very disappointing. We thought it was worth two stars for the Iron Man costume alone."
5,Iron Man Lives Again,Sam Raimi take note*Iron Man always fights with his mask ONAlso note how they just showed Tony Starks face THROUGH the mask if you needed to see him due to contractual obligations for x amount of screen time--AGAIN-Iron Man always fights with his mask ON--see previous line--
4,I liked it,I liked this movie. Mickey Rourke was surprisingly good in this. He was paid a relatively low salary to star in it but rose to the occasion. The gold teeth and cockatoo were his ideas (paid for and supplied by him). Gywneth Paltrow's role is finally given some substance instead of her just being a pretty / helpless part of the scenery - which was what she was given in the first movie. I can recommend this as a fun movie.
1,Only One Audio Option,You are out of luck if you do not have a DTS receiver. They decided to release the blu ray only in DTS HD.
4,...ok,"Well, the movie was beautiful. Right, we all enjoyed the escape. But it was as good as Iron Man 1? Not at all. There were some problems. Firstly, the chemistry with Ms. Potts seems to have been lost. In addition, the supporting actor, Mickey Rourke, has not been developed and felt very empty. Finally, the final battle of 1000 against the same robots Iron Man and his assistant, has been .... absolutely silent. I wish I could use a better word, but that seems to fit. How did you manage to build character Rourke a hundred robots perfect, without anyone noticing and only a few days time? Low ..."
1,GREAT MOVIE!! BUT THE CASE CAME BROKEN!!,"THIS REVIEW IS NOT OF THE MOVIE (4STARS)!.....DONT GET ME WRONG THE MOVIE IS FINE, LIKE THE FORST ONE BETTER, THE THING IS THAT WHEN I OPPENED THE CASE ALL THE DISCS FALLED BECAUSE THE CASE CAME BROKEN IN DIFFERENT PARTS. BESIDES THIS ISSUE ALL IS OK EVEN THE DIGITAL COPY CODE WORKED EVEN TOUGH IT ""MAY NOT BE VALID AFTER 9/28/2011""!!!!......"
1,Sad,"Maybe I could say two stars but after the first movie, this let down was far too much a crash and burn. Knowing that a bad review will convince some people to at the least see how bad it was, I just hope no one pays money to see it."
5,Iron Man 2,"Very enjoyable. Would have preferred if the studio would have kept Terrence Howard instead of Don Cheadle, but still very entertaining."
4,Iron Man 2,"I enjoyed this movie; however, comparing it to the original, I was a little disappointed that is seemed more Sci-fi than I usually like. Overall , I think it's a keeper."
4,great disk,"The disk arrived on time and worked great. The picture quality was very good with a little bit of grainy picture at times, this could also have been my TV settings. Great price, good movie what more could you want. Well I guess if it could load it's self that would not be a bad feature."
3,movie review,Decent movie to own for the purchasing price. More of an addition to a blue ray collection. Not a movie you are going to watch 50 times during the time of ownership.
3,Not nearly as good as the first!,It kind of started out silly! The story is not so great but the effects are what made this movie okay
4,A must see....,"Great movie, plenty of action and a must see before you see Marvels The Avengers. It has a good story line following the first Iron Man movie but I have one problem with this movie.... Lt. Rhodes is a different actor who is nothing like the one from the first movie. This new guy is more scrawney and looks so weird once he puts on the War Machine suit, it makes him like 3 feet taller then he is without the suit. Other than that it's a good movie and Robert Downey Jr. is awsome as Iron Man."
4,War Machine Was Awesome,"I was overall pleased with my purchase. I really enjoyed the movie. I do feel compared to the first it was only slight inferior, but otherwise it was still enjoyable to watch. I added this to my ""Pre-Avengers Collection"" with much anticipation. Even though I liked the movie it wasn't without its flaws. Some things in the story wasn't well resolved and the running gag with Stark and the Senator, while entertaining, was a bit unnecessary in my humble opinion. The movie really picked up when Rhodey donned the armor. I enjoyed him having a more important role in the film.Another gripe I have is I think Jon Favreau made himself involved in the movie more than he should have. I guess when you're the director you can do that. It's not major, but I just really didn't see a purpose of him being in the movie.Overall, it's a good guy. It has some good special features and I just enjoy it. Good buy."
5,Awesome,"Good price from Amazon, as always. It was a personal must see for me. Robert Downey has really made Tony Stark his character. If you liked the first one, you will enjoy this one as well. Cameo by the late DJ AM was nice. Scarlett looked hotter than ever. Samuel L. ""Mothereffin'"" Jackson steals the scenes. Go get it, all I can say."
4,Iron Man 2,"I purachased this DVD for my neighbors Kids for Christmas. Last year I gave them Iron Man, so this year I followed up with IM2."
4,Fitting Sequel,"I saw this when it came out in the theatres, which is the best way to see it. I must admit, it was a good movie, not nearly as good as the first one, but fitting for a proper sequel. I think the acting as so so, and the implemantation and direction was good. I am sure we will be seeing a 3rd installment of this one and hopefully it will have more character, possibly the storyline with the avengers. Overall though, it was a good movie."
3,A Set Piece for Iron Man III,"This is an intense action film at points. But at other points there seems to be too much cross-talk between Stark and his CEO (I find her voice to be particularly irritating). While the film has its moments, the producers of the film have a hidden agenda, that is to keep the Iron Man movies as a profitable franchise.Stark comes across as a spoilt brat that wants the world to be at his beck and call. The unit in his chest is slowly killing him and he resorts to recklessness as a solution. I feel that a successful person at that level would have been more mature and responsible.The final battle scene is at night ... again a bit of a let down.In order to set the stage for the next sequel, there are scenes with Samuel Jackson, who is the head of some sort of Justice League group and alludes to his troubles in the south-west. These scenes do not really add any present value to the film but ensures that the franchise will survive."
3,It was good...,"but Tony does a few things that a genius probably wouldn't - like slicing half of his electrical panels in the lab in two....The middle is a bit slow, but overall it's good. I think my main problem with the movie is just that Tony makes errors that us non-geniuses wouldn't."
1,Iron Man 2,"Received Iron Man 2 before expected date but found the bluray quality is pathetic, it stuck at the start I cant watch 2 starting chapter and then the 2nd last chapter stuck I have to skip those chapters. I did not write to you about this because this is the second time happened with me last time you people sent wrong bluray of Journey to the center of the earth and when I complained you refunded its amount and then I placed new order with Iron Man 2 this is the reason I did not complained due to your irresponsible attitude next time I must be careful before ordering any product."
