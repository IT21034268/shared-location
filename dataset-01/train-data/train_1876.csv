2,dirty devil,i like the light weight of this stick cleaner. it needs more suction power though. i mainly wanted thisto suck up dog hair off the hardwood floors. it takes several sweeps across the same area to suck upall the dirt and dog hair. i would not buy this product again.
4,electric broom,"This is a nice, inexpensive, lightweight vacuum cleaner that seems to work as well on carpet as on tile. I'm happy with it."
2,SWIFT BUT NOT STRONG,"This is a nice little portable stick vac. suction is not as strong as I would have hoped, but it works picking up random dust and as an in betweener from heavy vacuuming."
1,weak,"it`s not as strong as i expected , it can not collect hair and visible dust. i dot recommend this product.."
4,Great For Quick Pick Ups and Stairs,"I bought this a week ago and am very pleased. It picked up dust and debris from the baseboard area of the carpet and easily picked up dirt the kids tracked in. Cleaning the stairs was very easy given how light the vacuum is. It moves from carpeted areas to hardwoods with no difficulty.On the downside, some of the components, such as the cord holder, seem flimsy. Also, the handle tends to twist slightly. These could be bigger problems later."
3,A little disappointed,"This is a very lightweight handy vac, but I wish it had just a bit more power. It replaced one with the wedge that I loved, but can't find another. It's ok for the light duty I bought it for though."
3,Literally a stick.,"I guess I did get what I paid for, but I still expected some kind of better vacuuming. Then again, who really can justify spending $200 on a great vacuum because at the end of the day...it's just a vacuum."
1,junk,"I bought this with the idea of quick touch-ups in the kitchen (crumbs, pet hair etc.) between regular vacuumingA waste of money. Dirt devil should be ashamed to even market this sweeper.Has very little suction at first it seemed to work a little, but you had to go very slow and repeatedly go over the same area several times...to pick up even the lightest crumbs and dirt.But after a few days, it wouldn't even do that much. It would suck up a little dirt but didnt even have enough vacuum to make it to the cannister and all the dirt would fall out again when you turned the sweeper off.I kept emptying the cannister even though it has little in it hoping that it would help but to no avail.Save your money and invest in something better."
4,Lightweight and effective,"For having a relatively quiet motor, this thing does a good job of cleaning. It is also very light and easy to assemble, clean, and reassemble. My only complaint is that its efficiency goes down long before the debris container is full."
2,Works okay but could be better.,"We got this to try to have an easily accessible vacuum tool. Which it is, but it does have a drawback--its pickup is rather weak. The good thing is that it is electrically powered so it keeps on going, unlike a battery-driven vacuum."
1,Garbage. Drop Blue and Go GREEN,"This painter's tape has been a standard for a long time, yet that doesn't mean you are stuck with it. Try that FROG green painter's tape and compare. You won't go back to this bleed behind the seem blue painter's tape again."
5,Good Stuff,I love this masking tape. Goes on well; edges resist bleeding; easily removed after painting; doesn't dry out in place and doesn't leave adhesive residue.
4,blue light,"A little masterpiece and probably Deacon's best album. Great atmospheres turning from classic pop cuts to soft jazz sounds with great vocal extravaganzas from Lorraine McIntosh. All songs are good and stylish with 'The Wildness', 'Closing time' and 'One day I'll go walking' sparkling over the pack. Relaxing and groovy, it's suggested after a noisy night out, breaking softly the silence of morning early hours."
1,What the Heck?,"This iron came with no instructions.The handle does not have a spring, does not lock and I still can't manipulate it.The box suggests getting on line if you have questions. Not what I expected from aproduct described as professional.No warrentee material.Buyer beware."
2,Moderized,"I was looking for a CD that featured not only traditionalMaori songs, but also traditional Maori instuments. This CD has the songs, but the music is played by an electric guitar combo- no poi balls :("
3,Was this really done in 2004?,"The sound quality is terrible. It sounds like they recorded it in the 30's or something. Or they had the microphones wrapped in towels or something.Note the songs. They're not special arrangements or anything, just classic hymns. so make sure you like those.Anyway, it really sounds like they recorded it in the thirties. I personally like the vintage sound (or imitation vintage sound), but I'm eccentric, and I recognize it's just not the same quality as most of their CD's."
4,"Worked great, much thicker than you'd expect 'tape' to be","3M Scotch 4011 Exterior Mounting Tape worked great for mounting some Mylar to the walls of a room. I chose to get this product instead of double-sided tape because I wanted to make sure it would last a long time. However, I didn't realize that this 'tape' was so thick. It's at least a centimeter thick and adds definite bulk between the two things you are mounting to each other. For my application, I probably would have been better off getting regular double-sided tape. However, this product work greats and would be perfect if you have something heavier that you would like to mount."
2,Not Strong Enough For The Sun,"Upon reading that this tape was strong and made for outdoors I bought it to hold my car's gps base plate since the tape that came with my plastic plate holder did not hold.Well, it was pretty much the same. This tape did not hold my gps as soon as the car was left in the sun. outside temperature was 83 degrees.So much for this ""strong"" double sided tape."
1,HORRIBLE!! DO NOT BUY THIS TAPE -IT IS WORTHLESSW,"Unless you want more stress for the holidays, find some other tape. This tape does not stick on anything!! And it won't hold anything that weighs over .00005 ounces. I put up a little red ribbon on my vinyl siding and it fell within 2 minutes and the tape was worthless and had lost it stick. Then I tried putting it on my wooden shudder. Same thing. I am so disgusted at this ripoff. They advertise it as outdoor mounting tape. What are we supposed to do with it. Glue marbles on our front porch floor?????? I am so mad so I wanted to warn you."
5,3M products,Any 3m product works great this 1 did I knew it would. I have used 3 M products for 40 years. thanks Amazon.com
5,Double sided tape,Thanks for the prompt delivery! This tape works great for all types of outdoor applications. I am going to use it to stick my LED lights to my motorcycle. I know it will adhere for a long time! ThanksChris
5,"3M 3M Scotch Exterior Mounting Tape, 1-Inch by 60-Inch",2 sided tape works realy well even when it gets wet i know i used this on my boat and this held up very well
1,A REAL lightweight,"I first used this cleaner on stains that were about one month old. When nothing came up I thought the stains were too old. But when I tried it on a stain that was not even one week old, and still nothing, I returned it. This cleaner really is a lightweight."
3,Good but there is better.,"This is a light cleaner which picks up general dirt. The only downside is this models brush does not spin, it simply sits on the ground and drags as you pull the unit. You need to scrub any real stains manually to get them clean. The Bissell Powerbrush 2080 spins and for $20 more does a much better job and it is still light! Happy Cleaning."
5,My carpets are so clean!,"My carpets and rugs are so clean I can't stop looking at them! I was not aware how dirty they all actually were and am happy wiht my investment to purchase a carpet cleaner! It is very lightweight and easy to use and does an excellent job cleaning my carpet. I also like the size becuase it is easy to find a storage spot for it while I am not using it. Having kids and 2 dogs, it works great at cleaning up spills and stains made by them! This product really has made cleaning fun for me! Seeing the before and after motivates me to want to do more! It really is an excellent machine!"
4,Great!,I recommend this product. I use mine constantly with a dog and little boys. Works great and still runs like new after many uses!
4,Bissell Quicksteamer,This was exactly what we were looking for - have had others which were too cumbersome or ineffective. This is simple and quick. Priced right.
4,Not a steam cleaner but a Nice Cleaner anyhow,"I just got my Bissell QuickStemer and I could not be happier. For the price it was perfect, and light weight. I did need an extension cord because once I started I did not want to stop. I loved that I could see the dirt pulling up and when I emptied it: proved to me it works! I used 1/2 Vinegar and 1/2 Hot water. Easy as 1-2-3."
4,works pretty well,"Works pretty well for the money invested in it. I wouldn't really call it a deep cleaner. It probably cleans at a level between deep and superficial. Sucks up water pretty well. I only use it for spot cleaning (pet accidents :( ) but I imagine cleaning a room efficiently may take a decent amount of time. I found that it was difficult to remove the odor from older urine stains even with pre-soaking and the bissel 2X pet odor solution. I have speckled berber carpet so I just poured some diluted bleach on the stain, let it soak for 2 minutes, then sucked it up with the vacuum cleaner. Removed all the smell. Probably wouldn't recommend bleach for solid colored or nice carpet..."
5,A Best Buy,"This is an excellent, lightweight carpet cleaner. Easy to manuever, did a fine job of removing dirt and stains from heavy traffic areas on our carpet, and the Amazon price is right. Would definitely recommend it."
4,Bissell Quicksteamer,Very easy to use and lightweight. Works great on pet and kid stains. The fill tank could be slighter larger.
3,Decent cleaner for a low price,"I bought this because it was the cheapest steamer vac I could find. Didn't really want to invest in a steamer, but with a muddy creek, a large dog, and a house up for sale, I had to have something to quickly clean muddy paw prints off my brand new carpet. Before getting the steamer, each foot print had to be sprayed, scrubbed, and dried by hand. With the steamer, it takes up the majority of the stain pretty decently, but it takes a lot of going back and forth and for the deeper stains, you still have to get a towel and scrub. I think if I jump on the spots as soon as they show up, it will work best."
2,Big disappointment !!!,"The good: Cute little machine, lightweight, easy maneuvering, good size for a small closet. Not cheap plastic if you assume so just buy looking at its picture or the price. But I still have to return it because....The bad: It does not work at all. Read other 2-3 stars reviews and it is exactly as discribed. I hate to admit what people complained were right and I'll consider the low rating before any purchase after this one. It is for sure a ""lightweight"".The neutral: Amazon's free return shipping has save face for Bissell. I still don't upgrade to another model."
5,Love it!,"this steam cleaner is perfect. My floor looks way,way,way better than it did. I do have children and everything came up. Floor dried very fast got all the dirt it possible could. I would recommend this product for everyone."
4,Great light weight carpet cleaner,"Our home is small (3 rooms w/carpet) and we just got a puppy. This cleaner is excellent for everyday use. Light weight, easy to maneuver and my favorite thing is it the handle lies almost flat so I don't have to move my coffee table to clean the rug!It is so easy to clean I don't even mind if I have to use it very day!I only gave it 4 stars because they could have included the floor attachment! Yet I will buy one because I am so impressed with this Bissell!"
2,it will do,"well Ive had the small bissel, the little green bisel and it did not last long at all, but it probably wouldve done a better job than this one had it been working. the squirter broke first then the suction on that one. so i thought id try this one. i live in a small ny city apt and needed it for my rugs. it worked ok for the shag white rug, but it didnt look any whiter and when i looked in the fibers closely there was still dirt. also it was not good with the other rugs that are not shag or short hair....i dont know what they are maybe burber...it didnt seem to suck too much cause the attachment isnt really close to the rug. all and all i wouldnt buy another bissel. it will suffice to get SOME dirt out but not really do a very good job. i was told the hoovers are way better even if they are expensive and bulkier."
3,Just Okay,I think this product was ok for the occasional clean up but anything more than that and it just couldnt keep up. Mine eventually stopped working properly and would not suck up the water unless I pressed my foot on the front of the machine to apply pressure to get it to suck up. Right now its in my basement and is of no use to me. I honestly think that if you can afford to you are better off spending a little more and getting a better machine. I would only recommend this machine for small rooms that you need to do an occassional clean up of. It to me is no better than a portable cleaner.
3,Not so great for the money,Hello! I purchased this vacuum a fews ago to steam clean our great room carpet. I was disappointed in the size of the vacuum as well as how good it cleans. This steamer will clean recent dirt but not dirt/spills that are ground in or are a bit older. In reading the marketing hype on this product I thought it would do a much better job then it did. I would recommend skipping this product and purchasing a different brand or model.
1,Lousy waste of money,"This is NOT a steam cleaner. No steam involved. The bristles don't move. We spilled something wet and immediately tried to steam clean it. All it did was drip some water on the spot and then suck it back up. We don't have thick carpets, but I know it didn't get any sort of deep clean. Tried it on an old spot, too, and the steamer didn't clean that up, either. We're taking it back for a refund. Try another steam cleaner!"
1,Disappointing,"I had a Kenmore for 15 years which finally gave out and I got this one. Was a good little cleaner for one use. Then the trigger broke. Had it repaired, then the pump system went. Would be great if it didn't fall apart each time it is used."
2,"Bissell QuickSteamer Upright Deep Cleaner, 1770 review","Bissell QuickSteamer Upright Deep Clea ner i was really interested was not how i imagined it to be. its broom at the bottom didnt turn or anything there was no difference in my carpet, all it did for me was it made my carpet wet for a while."
4,"Surprisingly effective, but small paths, small resevoir","I had bought this (under the model 1970R, but it looks to be the same model) because I found it refurbished for a can't lose price ($29.99 shipped, which is cheaper than smaller carpet cleaners that I've looked at), so I gave it a shot. I am very happy with the results of the machine's cleaning abilities. I am also very surprised at just how much dirt has been in my carpets. For what I paid, and the results, I give it 5 stars. However, I know that deal is far and gone, so I am giving it a more realistic 4 stars.The drawbacks are the width of the cleaning (quite narrow, leading to more paths, which is more time consuming) as well as a small container for your water/chemicals. The manual says to work in 3' x 4' areas, so you can imagine how long it takes to do a large room if you have to keep filling up. My other problem with it is the container that holds your dirty water is difficult to clean out the gunk and hair that collects in it."
1,NOT A STEAMER!,"Don't let the name fool you - this is not a ""quick steam"" anything. I bought it for hardwoods & tile (at the suggestion of a salesman -ha!) and I am severly disappointed with the way it worked. I will admit, it did clean, but left streaks on my tile floors. I have done them 3 times & finally got out the swiffer & did it that way. I will be taking this back (I think the name should equal false advertisment, so hopefully that works!) and buying an actual STEAMER. I cannot say how this works on carpets because I was so disgusted with it I didn't even try it out."
4,Easy to use,"I previously had an inexpensive Dirt Devil which gave out after 3 years, so I bought this Bissell machine to replace it for occasionally freshening up my carpet. It is NOT a 'steamer'. The name is deceiving. It's a basic carpet cleaner. The closest it comes to being a steamer is the temperature of water that you put in it.Assembly took, literally, 5 minutes and it's as simple to use as a vacuum. It cleans very well, but I suggest first spot treating any areas that need it. For the price it's a good machine. Be aware, there are no furniture cleaning attachments included."
5,Fantastic Product!,"Bissell 1770 Quicksteamer Lightweight Upright Deep Cleaner Carpet CleanerThis is the best product I have ever purchased for this low price. I have been amazed at its performance and durability. I use it constantly with 3 wiener dogs in the house, I needed something that was lightweight yet compact and this is perfect. It cleans like a dream and it is fantastic!I recommend this highly if you need something really high quality within a good budget for your home and family. I am so thrilled, and I plan on purchasing more for my family and friends as gifts. This is a have to have machine."
3,7 out of 10,"Luckily, this book does not have the slow, tedious writing style of The Blue Sword, but The Blue Sword had a much better plot. Door in the Hedge is still only an average retelling of a few fairy tales. The original tales are just *okay*, too, not wonderful. Robin McKinley never adds very much to her retellings except length. Maybe beautiful language. Robin McKinley's biggest fans will want to get this one, but there's not too much for people who are just starting on her work."
5,Love Robin McKinley,This is a lovely story. I recommend reading pretty much anything Robin McKinley has ever written. She is a very beautiful story teller.
2,Not McKinley's best,"This book is not one of Robin McKinley's best. I opened with high expectations because I've read Sunshine and Beauty by the same author. This book, however, was sourly disappointing. The first story wasn't that good, but I thought it would get better.It didn't.Like the other two books I've read by McKinley(and like someone mentioned below), it needs more dialogue. There are so many pages that I got bored and stopped paying attention without even realizing it- then I read the page again and the same thing happened.Another thing that irks me about this book is how the people fall in love. They don't know know each other but they someone know that they love each other. What? This is pretty typical of fairy tales, but I was hoping McKinley would be better.So, in the end, it looked like a good book... but wasn't at all."
2,Not my cup of tea,"Another young adult book by an author good at fairy tales, but this one is a collection of four fairy tales instead of a stand alone story. The book blurb says that two of the fairy tales are retellings and two are ""new"", but I found all of them to feel like retellings of stories I'd already heard. I didn't care for the book, but the kidlet loved it. He just likes McKinley, I think."
5,Quietly enchanting book,"This is one of the least appreciated books by Robin McKinley, but it contains some of her most beautiful writing. This collection of retellings of classic fairy tales is enchanting, beautiful, subtle, and all-together wonderful. It contains little action or adventure, relying on tales of love and enchantment that resonate and glow with beauty. It's recently been reprinted. Pick it up before it disappears again from shelves."
4,Wonderful writing,"The Door in the Hedge is a collection of four stories by Robin McKinley. I would summarize them all, but that has been done already by many others and I'm not very good at it. So anyway, here are my thoughts on the book.For starters, Robin McKinley is an amazing writer, definately one of the best out there today. The stories are all interesting as well.My only problem with this book, is that each of the four stories centers around a female, and in every story, the female character seems to be the same (a beautiful princess). But other than that, the book was wonderful. I definately want to read more books by this author!"
5,The Most Beautiful Children's Story Book,I was very impressed with the quality of the book cover and case. The artwork inside and out is very beautiful. Beatrix Potter's Tales in their best form.
4,Wonderful book but felt like too much was on one page.,"I love this book. It is beautifully bound and the paper quality is wonderful. However, for one story where normally you would have one illustration on each page with a few sentences. In this book to save page # they put 2-3 illustrations and the content with the image on the page. So the pages look a little too busy for a youngster."
5,"Bedtime reading turned into morningtime reading, too!","I purchased this single book collection of Beatrix Potter stories because our oldest, aged four, loves Peter Rabbit. We had planned to read one story per evening before bed but the great writing style and pictures of Ms. Potter so grabbed our four year old's attention that we ended up reading one at bed, at rising in the morning and before nap time. Even my husband would drop what he was busy with to come and listen to storytime! The adventures and the names Ms Potter came up with are charming and fun to say. One does have to know some Engligh terms and be able to explain those vocabulary on the quick but it sure is fun to hear your child increase his vocabulary with the neighbor kids! We have certainly gotten a hoot out of the appropriate word usage he has picked up from these stories and then will explain to his friends to help ""teach"" them. We've read through this book many times to our delight."
5,The Complete Tales of Beatrix Potter,"This book is absolutely gorgeous! I am so happy with it. I got it for my little great-niece so she, too, can be enchanted by these wonderful tales and drawings."
5,Ideal keepsake gift,Beatrix Potter The Complete Tales is well worth buying. Of course it is beautifully illustrated with all the loved tales. It comes in a gift box which means that when it is not being used it can be safely stored!
5,Lovely book,This is a wonderful book and makes a truly lovely gift. The illustrations are beautiful and the quality is excellent. An outstanding gift for any baby or child. I've bought three already!
5,"Wonderful, Imaginative, Have to Have Book",This book is a must have for anyone with kids or grandkids. We love all the stories and read them over and over.
5,Beautiful book!,I bought this book for our grandson who is 8 yrs old. He loves to read and the stories are wonderful as well as the illustrations by Beatrice Potter. I will order one for our little granddaughter as soon as she is old enough to enjoy. I would recommend this book as it is a lifetime treasure of beautiful stories.
5,Pass this book on from generation to generation!,"This is a lovely book that comes in a sturdy, decorative, open-eneded box to protect the volume. Besides containing all of Beatrix Potter's wonderful children's stories, it has all of the original illustrations in one volume. This is the perfect ""bedtime story"" book, and it sits on the nightstand next to my 11-old-granddaughter's bed. She reads the stories to her 3-year-old sister every night, and is planning on continuing the tradition with her 1-year-old brother. She told me that she is enjoying the stories as much as her little sister!I purchased this book as a gift for their family, and, as a proud grandmother, I can't think of anything that costs so little and yet gives so much. I would recommend this book for anyone! I am going to purchase another copy for my own house, just in case I have guests who show up with little ones. It's a perfect addition to anyone's library, and I highly recommend it."
3,Received a different cover book of Beatrix Potter The Complete Tales...,"I did not think it happened to me but I received a different cover book of Beatrix Potter The complete Tales. I saw one review already mentioned it. The book had different cover as very simple Peter rabbit inside of over shape, hard cover with blue back ground. As I adult, it looked good to me but not for my neice who aged only 6 years old. I decided to keep it for another teenager neice and placed an order again. I reported to Amazon and they also wondered they had different version of it. New order will be arrive today afternoon and I'll tell Amazon which one I get this time. In addition, my order came late even I ordered it with special offer of one day free shipping from discover card."
2,Totally different cover than depicted,The book in the photo is what I wanted and have given as a gift before. The one I received was a totally different cover not even similar! I didn't like it as well but there was not enough time to try an exchange with you before I needed to give the gift at a special occasion. Totally disappointed in you. Meredith
3,audiobook tracking (Nadia May) ANNOYING - what were they thinking?!,"We've taken this one out of our local library and the tracking on the cds is incredibly annoying. In spite of tracking every few minutes, and that these are *very* short tales, often only 2-3 tracks long, not one of the stories we have heard thusfar begins at the beginning of a track. That's right, there is no way to hear any of these stories (including the first one, The Tale of Peter Rabbit) without fast forwarding through a track to find the beginning. What was Blackstone THINKING when they broke the tracks up like this?! Needless to say, we shall not be purchasing a copy of this one - we'll go looking for the Shelley Frasier version (Tantor) instead."
3,Difficult to read,"I loved the tale of Peter Rabbit so I decided to get the collection of Beatrix Potter's ""tales"" for my 4 year old son. I've been trying to introduce books that are a bit longer and have different stories or chapters to encourage him to want to hear the next story (pre-reading skills). He often used to ask me to read an entire children's book which could be as long as 45 pages, which wouldn't help him when he was learning to read and I wouldn't want him to become frustrated. Many of the Beatrix Potter stories are a bit difficult to read aloud to a child since the language is more proper English rather than current day conversational English and consequently can be difficult to follow for a young child."
5,A treasure,"This book is a beautifull keepsake. Printing set out well and pictures are colourfull. I bought this for myself a mature women, to read and for my future grandchildren."
5,Just What I Wanted,The Peter Rabbit Story book I received is a compilation of all the small books of the series put out originallyby Warne Publishers. I need the original images to paint a series of porcelain plates with Peter and his friends.This just fit the bill. Thanks.
5,A Must Have,This is a beautiful book. I loved these stories as a child and was thrilled to get them for my own two young children. When I opened the book and saw it's quality I bought a second for the children and kept this one just for me :) A true keepsake.
3,Beautiful but too bulky for real use,"While this is a beautiful anthology, I find that my children never choose to read it or look at it themselves because it is simply too heavy and bulky for little hands. It's heavy to hold while laying down reading before bed, so I don't tend to pick it as a read-aloud either. The binding has also broken loose from the pages, caused by a very little girl trying to carry the book by the front cover! I've decided to break down and get the individual boxed set of stories so that we will actually read them!"
5,Perfect Again,I loved listening to the quirky reality of Beatrix Potter's world as a child and I know have a copy of Beatrix Potter Complete Tales R/I (Hardcover) which I read to my 5 y.o. boy and 3 y.o. girl who love every nuance. My personal favorit character is Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle.
5,Beatrix Potter's Tales are Part of our Cultural Woodwork,"I became familiar with at least one of these tales when I was a child, but it was not until I had my own child that my mother gave my daughter The Complete Tales, which I eagerly read to her. We enjoyed it thoroughly and reread our favorites over and over. There is a lot of variety in these stories of anthropomorphized animals, at times interacting with humans. They run the gamut from sweet tales to high drama to hilarity. They're just great to read to children, inspiring their imaginations, touching their hearts, enlarging their vocabularies and their understanding of both the human and animal worlds, and sometimes seamlessly imparting guidance for decent and civil behavior. In my opinion (and my daughter's, judging by her reaction), ""The Tale of Two Bad Mice"" ranks as one of the funniest stories in the English language. We laughed until we ached!"
4,Good deal if you are willing to wait,The book was in great condition. Just would recommend ordering well in advance mine took over two weeks to get shipped to me other than that they give you what you ask for at a great price. Half of the college bookstore price.
5,The Bears of Katmai,"Buy this book for the outstanding photographs!!! I thouroughly enjoyed this book, and everytime I pick it up, I get this urge to fly to Alaska to see these magnificent creatures."
5,Stunning photos of magnificent and sensitive animals,This book is beautiful; a work of art. Matthias Breiter may very well be the most knowledgeable naturalist on earth when it come to brown bears.
3,Works well for the type,"This is simply a foam filter that removes most refuse from the water. It stays operational for a fair amount of time considering the volume and number of critters. While other filters are more effective, here you get what you pay for: a simple, easy to clean filter that gets rid of most of the ""yucks""."
2,Watch the hole and shipping costs,"These are fine for experimenting with, but I will end up buying something better for real use. The hole for the screw that holds the stack together will let white through, washing out the color somewhat. Also, the shipping cost was equal or higher than the actual cost of the product. Not a great value if ordered alone (as I did)."
3,Lots of colors a little small though,Had to add additional tape to make it fit my flash strobe. works but nothing spectacular.
5,Excellent,I have no problem with you. The product is excellent - the price is right - What the hell!
4,Great Gels,"Im using this like most probably are as cheapo gels for my camera flash and it works great for what there are. They werent designed for this, but they work. The size isnt perfect and there is a hole in it. Im really looking forward to the strobist pack they are supposedly working on.+Cheap+More gels than I will ever need+Compact-Its a pain taking the gels out of the holder.-There is a hole in them"
3,Rosco Swatch Book,"Service was good, packaged well, and shipped fast. The gels start warping after 3 or 4 flashes. Usable, but poor quality."
4,"Nice, Decent and Cheap","Bought from ""BarnDoor Lighting Outfitters"", Amazon Prime buyer.I didn't have any particular contact with the seller. Fast and easy shipping method. No complain against seller.|| Rosco Rosco Lux Small Swatchbook ||Pros:# Cheap# Lots of colors# Separated by papers with description# Nicely packedCons:# Small in size [Length is ok but breadth might not fit all kind of flash]# Doesn't come with proper box thus its hard to arrange after opening.# Too thin# Starts to deform after 3/4 continuous shots so its better to take of after 2/3 shot and give some time to cool down.I am an new photographer doing experiments on different types of photography so I am really happy with this. It is actually cheap and comes with so many shades that even if one in destroyed I can use almost similar shades as replacement. So I don't mind but if someone if looking something professional and thinking to work for a long time THIS MIGHT NOT BE THE RIGHT DEECISION"
4,Good book for someone starting with the concept,"Es un buen texto para alguien que quiera empezar con el concepto, tiene una buena metodología y es una buena referencia. Debería tener ejemplos de casos exitosos de outsourcing"
5,Semi-oriental mellow,"Obviously, I have a good memory. And a long one as well, this is 2008. BUT, it was worth the wait. Well mixed & edited, very smooth, and exactly as good as I remembered."
5,Thoroughly enjoyable.,"Very haunting music and a pleasure to listen to. I'm not normally a fan of this type of music, but for this I'm willing to make an exception. I recommend this to anyone who appreciates good music."
5,Nice Blend of Traditional and Modern Styles,i watched the television series and very much enjoyed it. I sought out the music to it because it made watching so much more interesting. Excellent music.
3,Farscape season 4 review,One of the discs was cracked but the seller compensated us for it and was quick to respond.
4,As advertised,"On time delivery,good condition. Every Season of Farscape is good in my opinion. However, I'm sure some will disagree. Nothing's perfect."
5,Great SiFi,"Many years ago I saw this great SiFi serie, now I can get it and continue love it, like the first day I saw it."
4,Good,Wish they made a fifth season instead of the Peacekeeper wars. It totally ends on a cliffhanger.
5,Farscape: Season 4,"The Farscape: The Complete Season 4 disk set is sensational, six disks in a box of 22 episodes, a must for the true ""Farscape Fan""."
5,Farscape S4,"Excellent Show! If this show was still on the air today, I'd still be watching. Four seasons was not enough."
2,Right material but kind of flat,"I bought this pillow to replace a memory foam neck pillow I lost while traveling. It helped with my neck and shoulder pain and made hotel pillows more comfortable. However, this new one is too flat and doesn't give me as much support as I need. It's better than the microbead ones in Walmart and Target, and it's better than nothing, but I don't love it."
5,Nice and Compact,"Works well and just as I had hoped...comfortable with just enough support. I live in a condo with lots of noise from the unit above so I have to sleep with earbuds connected to a white noise machine. Since I sleep on my side, this pillow works perfectly when placed on top of my standard pillow. I can then wear the earplugs without them poking me in the ear all night. I would recommend it!"
3,Soft but sinks very quickly,The pillow is nice and small so great travel size but not a great long distance traveling pillow. I bought one for my husband and I to ease our long flight to France...this pillow was not as great as some of the comments stated. Both of the pillows sunk in about an hour into our 9 hour flight. It may be more useful for short flights but I don't recommend for very long flights.
5,Great,This pillow is wonderfully comfortable and convenient. The cover is soft without being slippery. It can be easily removed and laundered while airing out the pillow.
4,Comfortable but Bulky,"I bought this for overseas flights and it worked fine. The cover is very soft and comfortable. You have to work the foam around to make it fit in the position you're in, but that's one of the benefits over the air-filled variety. I found that the foam compressed enough to fit it in a backpack but it does take up some room. This can't be helped if you want to improve your comfort over the rigid balloon neck supports."
3,comfy but not for long distance flight,"It's very comfortable, but it's not suitable for wearing it on the neck on the airplane. I bend it and use it as a pillow and lean against the window during my 15-hour flight."
4,Need another one,"This pillow is great.I took it to Europe (8-10hr flights) and it was so nice to have support for my head.When I got back home, my wife tried it, and now she uses it while working on her computer and I've lost mine. I'll be ordering a 2nd one."
2,Very disappointing,"I just received my order and as soon as I finish writing this review I'll be listing it to sell on ebay or amazon. It's not worth the trouble or expense to return it so I'm glad I at least got free shipping for it from amazon. The pillow is indeed extremely soft and comfortable to touch, however it offers absolutely no supprt. I'm a very average sized person, I don't have an abnormally slender neck, but the pillow just flops around. It's also much too thin to offer any support. If this one is 4"" thick than I need one that's about 7"" thick to offer me any support. I do not recommend it."
2,Does not fit my neck,This product is not for people who have thick necks. Having the size of the pillow would have been a great help.The foam does NOT soften with body heat is uncomfortable. I did not return it as I found it useful as a pillow between my knees as I sleep.I do not recommend this product as a neck pillow.
2,Like a rock,"No its not a Chevy, buut it is very hard and uncomfortable to me. There is not support for your head and barely any give to it at all. I returned it after one day."
5,Wonderful!,My husband and I were looking for support pillows that wouldn't be too expensive and that were somewhat firm. The ortho pillow covered everything we wanted. I'm glad we didn't buy one at the airport which was WAY too expensive. I know this will help us get through our 8 hour flight.
3,Works well but thought it would be better,"I'm giving this 3 stars because the pillow is firm, but I don't feel much support when I use it sitting up. Does help with my neck cramps however if i lean against it."
5,Gift,Bought as a gift for my Dad. He kept falling asleep in his chair and would wake up with a stiff neck. This made a world of difference!
3,"memory foam great, but a little small","well made, love the memory foam, but too small, you would have to have a very small neck to fit properly....need to make them larger, I'd be happy to pay extra for a little larger pillow."
2,not thick enough for sleep,"i bought this about 1 month ago due to the great reviews, i am returning it because i am still tossing and turning on my side at night. it is not thick enough, other than that the product is fine but i had one of these pillows that helped me stay sleep on my back but i lost it on my travels to italy...so sad that this did not replace it and do the job, now i will have to continue looking for one to keep my on my back while i sleep"
2,Rubber odor,"I was happy with the feel of this neck pillow but it has a nasty odor, part rubber and part petroleum. I'm going to wash and dry it and if it doesn't go away, send it back."
2,Too rough,"I took this pillow when I went from San Francisco to Italy, and I wish I'd taken another. My boyfriend bought a cheap, non-memory foam one that was a lot better than this one. It was way too rough, so my head kept falling to the sides as I tried to sleep. I don't recommend it if you like soft pillows like myself."
3,neck pillow,neck pillow really did nothing for my neck..it is uncomforable on the back of my head..don't waste your money on this
3,Neck Support Pillow,I found it to be way to expensive. After my purchase I saw other pillows at a much cheaper price.
2,Made my neck hurt more,"I originally found it very soft and comfortable, which it is. As weeks went on, I didn't understand why my neck problems started to get worse. Although I consider it a perfect softness and texture, I realized that these neck pillows worse your sitting posture by actually pushing your neck forward (think giraffe) because there is a pillow in between your neck and the back of the chair."
1,Never received,"I ordered a neck pillow which was to be delivered in early June; it was tracked and the PO left a notice of attempted delivery on June 4. Since I am not home during the day I gave permission to leave the item (worth $15) in the lobby of my condo. It was ridiculous to require a signature. That was as far as I could go . . . I cannot find where on amazon to ""contact seller""and so I have asked AMEX to credit my account in full."
2,A bit too stiff,The product is a bit stiff. Its not as I thought it would be like a pillow. Anyway I am trying to get used to it.
3,It Worked For Me.,"I purchased this item for a 14 hour flight, one-way, and it worked for me. I did finally fall asleep, and I am sure that without this item I would have experienced far more discomfort upon awaking than I did."
2,Commercials ad nauseam,"I've always loved Frasier and the whole cast. Unfortunately, Paramount has seen it fit to add up to seven minutes of commercials at the beginning of the discs, not editable and without the recourse of being bypassed. If I wanted to watch that c... I would do that in the reruns. Shame on Paramount!"
3,Paid for annoying advertisements!!!,"I love the Frasier series but the commercials that my husband and I have to sit thru on some of these dvd's drives us crazy!! You are not able to forward over them or skip them and everytime you want to watch another episode on that dvd you have to sit thru the near 10 minutes of advertisements again and again. This was our hard earned cash we paid to enjoy the privilege of watching Frasier at our own leisure without having to forward over commercials. Fortunately the commercials are not on all of the dvd's. However, I wish I could get my money back for the ones that do have them.Qualilty of sound and color is excellent!"
2,not pleased,"The new, never opened, series of Frasier has some discs that will not play. They stop and have tiling, chunked squared effects and wont continue to play. The dvd's were not the same as the photo shown in individual boxes, like the ones you buy in a store or rent. Came in a different looking box with all of the dvd's in clear plastic sleeves with no markings on them. I just want the discs to all play so I can see the episodes. The sound is not very loud on them either."
3,Frasier is GREAT! The packaging NOT SO MUCH!,"I love Frasier!! I think it's one of the best sitcoms to come out of the 90's. If you purchased this set for just the episodes, you'll be a very happy camper. However, I also look at the aesthetics of the actual set -- how will it look on my shelf for display. Unfortunately, you MAY or MAY NOT get each season in it's manufactured cardboard box. I'm guessing it depends on whether that particular shipping center has the correct pieces to bundle together. In my case, I received Seasons 1-7 in the slim, plastic cases....and Seasons 8-11 in their cardboard boxes. For some people, this won't be a problem. For me, I was unsatisfied with the purchase. I have since returned the item.I have uploaded a picture of what I received on the picture pages for this item.Yes, this set was SOLD & SHIPPED through Amazon.com and not a third party marketplace seller."
1,Factory Defects,"Opened only first 3 series and sent them back. Several discs had factory scrapes & pits. Some discs would not play some of the shows without locking up or skipping. Amazon vendor did issue full refund + extra for my trouble. They cost about $30 more but I purchased a new set from Walmart, thinking that if these were the same it would be faster & easier to return. I do not see any scrapes & so far the discs have played fine, so I guess it depends on where the discs were manufactured or maybe the first set was just a bad lot, although I have read of others having the same problem with this set."
3,NOT as pictured!,"I just rec'd my set and it is NOT as Amazon.com pictured --- it is like one of the buyer's pictures above...several cardboard boxes with several plastic cases --- this is misleading by Amazon.com!! I am also concerned because a previous review states that some of the episodes are ""messed up."" Given that this is a Christmas gift and is 11 seasons, this will probably not be found in time to return the item. I am somewhat disappointed!! Buyer beware on this purchase."
1,Poor Quality DVD's,"This was a Christmas gift...I just started watching this week starting with Season 1, so far 3 of the first 3 dvd's are unwatchable, scenes freezing, skipping. Tried on two different dvd players, same problem. I am extremely disappointed, be warned if purchasing this set, it is very poor quality and a complete waste of money."
2,Disappointed,"I have to say that I was a little disappointed with this ""set"". I expected it to be a true ""boxed set"" when in reality, it is all the dvd's from each season in plastic wrap. I know that is what the picture shows, but it said it wasn't out yet - to be released December 13, in time for Christmas etc...it was a little deceiving. I gave it to my sister for Christmas (she already had seasons one and two) and now she has the exact same thing repeated. It is Fraiser and all, but I expected a little more. Why was there a ""release date""? They basically took all the individual seasons and wrapped them together. Like I said, a little disappointed."
5,"Would love to buy, but much too expensive","I love Frasier, but who can afford it? I had all 11 seasons in my cart at $15.99, but took some time to think it over. When I came back online, they had all gone up where it was almost $50.00 more. PLEASE put this back on sale!! I need it bad!!!"
2,Frasier Complete series review,"Great series! Good to have the complete package. What I didn't like though is that these were meant for the US market, so I cannot run them on European DVD players with EU region code...However they do play on my laptop, and then I find it annoying that I do not have the Dutch subtitles. So in summary, I regret having bought this!"
1,This item is a fake import,Look at the set box (the box that the DVDs come in). The photo is not Eddie. It is a different dog breed. Consider yourselves warned.
1,MOST of them played OK,"Fast service but 1/3 of the discs wouldn't play on my 1 year old machine. Closer inspection showed obvious warping (sunken center, raised edges) and some deep scratches - obviously not in a sellable or usable condition. I can live with second hand, battered boxes, etc, but not with 15 silver coasters. Quality checking please!"
2,Season 2 not intact,I ordered the complete series set of Frasier and had the same issue as another buyer. Season Two was not in its original packaging. I'm returning it and buying it elsewhere.
3,What a waste of My money,"My own fault! I should have checked a couple of things before I ordered.The DVDs Will not play in My DVDplayer sins it's the wrong region. (I live in Sweden)They work on My MacBook, however there is no swedish language avaliable.I know I Will never use this collectionAlso, I had to pay the UPS-driver equivalent 50 dollars for additional taxes."
3,From the Student's Perspective,"As an engineering student using this text everyday there aredefinite strengths and weaknesses of the text. The text iswritten cleary, but at times rambles, and can confuse thereader. Example problems are generally clear and help the readerunderstand, but again, tend to add too much unnecessary theory anddiscussion. The Engineer is only interested in ways to solveproblems and a general explanation, not page after page oftheory development and formula integrations to explain a formula. Strong points are goodrelation of physics to everyday experience, clear and easilyunderstood diagrams, and a progressive arrangement of the material.""Physics for Scientists and Engineers"" by Fishbane et al wouldbe a ""bible"" for engineering physics if 2/3 of the unnecessaryand vague discussions were removed, and problem solutions clarified rather thansimple answers given at the back of the book. Engineers learn more by example,and unfortunately too few useful examples are provided."
3,Nice but...,"The 4 small dishes were packaged badly. Despite being buried in the middle of the box, they arrived broken with just a thin piece of non-corrugated cardboard between them."
5,Swissmar is a quality product!,"The cast iron means that this product holds the heat evenly distributed in the cooker. The accessories are ok, but the actual fondue pot is outstanding."
3,"Good lid, but a little bit pricy","Arrival condition:The lid was dirty. Looked like it just come form the tin mill where the manchinst had pressed the lid.Current condition:After a good washing, the lid was put together with the wooden handle. It is a good lid, but I was expecting more of a higher quality of material.Conclusion:I bought the lid because of the high reviews. I am giving this a 3 star because of the low quality material and the condition the lid had arrived. Dirty, gritty and not put together. Like I said, maybe I was expecting a higher quality lid."
4,Good product,We bought this to go with our Lodge cast iron wok. (Which we love.) Now we are able to steam the vegetables while we are stir frying them.
3,jumping right in the pool,"I used this book as part of an independent study of logic. It is dense, so unless you are willing to sit down and study it exhaustively or you have an experienced teacher (as I did), start with something lighter. That said, once I gained some knowledge in the area, the book was a pleasure to use, as Lemmon's precise language made it easier to clarify certain points. The largest drawback to this book is that it doesn't have solutions to its exercises, and these methods are not mechanical-you must know or learn how to make intuitive leaps or you will not be able to solve the problems. davewitt@technologist.com"
4,"Clear demonstration of logical rules, explanation is odd","This is an older book, so it is a little wordy. The wording of explanations for rules is a bit strange, but its okay because Lemmon follows all explanations with examples."
5,Tremendo cd,"no tengo mucho que decir... tremendo cd. Este cd cuando salio ya estaban las 8 canciones nuevas que salieron pegas y sonando en la radio a to lo que da... Hector ft Polaco ""La Envidia"" tremenda cancion... Hector ft Polaco y Yomo otro palo, tiraera para Jomar jaja... Yomo ft Hector ""Que Se Sienta"" y Ariel ft Hector ""La que los noquea"" son hits instantaneos... comprenlo que vale la pena."
4,I miss my Ned's Shirt....,"Unfortunately, time did in the shirt but not this CD. I still have it in my regular rotation. The Ned's still pack a punch and their grunge/pop formula gets it right. The band had a devoted following, ask anyone who saw them live.""Happy"" is one of the best songs of the early 90s. Other great stuff includes ""Grey Cell Green"", ""Kill Your Television"", ""Throwing Things"" and ""Less Than Useful"".Recommended, definitely."
1,I just bought a very bad copy!,"I am really dissapointed! The CD I ordered wasn't the original layout as shown in the picture on the website. You still have GODFODDER in grey letters with a colourful background but I got this ridiculous 2cm wide blue box around it.Same with the CD itself. The artwork that should be there isn't. It is a blue CD, definately not how Ned's Atomic Dustbin would have sold it theirselves.Worst part: the titles of the songs are in a different order on the back of the cd box. Luckily the music on the CD itself is in the original order.IF YOU SELL COPIES, SELL GOOD COPIES!I'd rather rated it 0 stars but I couldn't..."
2,Now In The Dustbin,"God Fodder is another one of those discs that seemed a lot harder and angrier when it came out than it does now. Ned&#65533;s anthemic &#65533;Kill Your Television&#65533; sounds more than a little tired 10 years later. Worse, the rest of the disc is so similar in style and tone that it could pass for remix versions. Of interest to die hard fans and nostalgia buffs only."
3,"It'll make you ""Happy"".","God Fodder is a pretty good album of early 90's brit-pop. Actually it's more brit-rock, considering that most of the album is fairly heavy, compared to others in the genre. The two big songs on here are also the two best, those are ""Kill Your Television"" and ""Grey Cell Green"". But numerous other tracks are good and catchy too, like ""Cut Up"" and ""Throwing Things"". If you're a fan of the era, or of similar bands, check out ""Ned's Atomic Dustbin"". You won't know ""Until You Find Out""."
1,Easily The Most Boring Book I Have Ever Read,"Every book that I have ever bought has gone onto my bookshelf after I've read it, awaiting the day when I dust it off and re-read it. Not so with this one. I gave it away within 48 hours of reading it. Just one huge yawn after another."
2,Look for the italics,"The central idea of this book, that humans can misread the ""progress"" or ""motion"" of a system (baseball, evolution, etc.) by misinterpreting the statistics (lies, damn lies, etc.) is valid, but he goes too far. Both the length of the book and many of his conclusions go beyond what is necessary or prudent. Redundancy is high, so this is a skimmer, for sure. Read the charts, read the bits with italicized headings, and keep your wits about you. His slavish repetitiveness is as engrossing as a Teletubby (Full House! Full House!). With the same message over and over again, it's best to stick to the salient points and move on. Good idea, worth maybe 25-50 pages, not 230. This self-important book needs a liberal edit, and a change of tone. Right now it's a gleefully self-righteous and bloated essay which won't be heard outside the choir-box."
5,This is one of my favorite books,"I like Gould's style. He is a scientist and not a philosopher. So many other books of this type present purely philosophical, or even worse religious, arguments which have nothing to do with reality (you can ""prove"" anything with pure logic if you make the correct initial assumptions). This sort of pap is an insult the reader's intelligence. Stephen Gould makes a compelling and logical argument which is supported by empirical evidence and not assumptions. Before reading this book I accepted the popular myth that evolution tends to produce complexity. This book has reduced my ignorance.I thought the link between baseball and evolution was clever. Gould is a master at finding connections between seemingly disparate subjects. I"
2,Should have been an essay,Stephen Gould presents interesting and compeling arguments for an alternative view of evolution. The basic concept being that if you start out with the simpliest life form there is no way to go but up. He however had me convinced within the first 20 pages and filled the rest of the book going over ad infinitum the same points with a variety of similar statistical and logic arguments. I should have quit reading it but have nothing else new to read until my next Amazon shipment shows up this week
2,No need to have written this one,"While I'm usually a big fan of Gould (being a statistician with left-wing tendencies who believes the preponderance of evidence for plain-vanilla evolution is overwhelming), much of this book was pointless to publish.The points of his arguments on the decline of the .400 hitter are obviously true (So obvious that I knew them as a 12 year old - too bad I didn't publish!), but they hardly prove his premise. His points about statistical distributions are obvious as well. While it's fine to bring them up in context (e.g. Mortality rates of a population vs. that of an individual), he shouldn't pretend he's discovered something ""deep"" in statistics. I understand that he's gained popularity by association with baseball, but he should stick to his subject a little more.In fairness, I'd give the book 2.5 stars if I could."
2,No Duh Stephen!,"The hypothesis is pretty basic and the book takes a long time to get around to it. Not worth the read. He could have summarized all the good thinking in this book into a fairly short magazine article. In fact, let me summarize it for you and save the time. Evolution doesn't inherently lead to more complex organisms (like humans), scientists just focus on those organisms at the expense of simple ones (like bacteria). There, now you can read something else instead."
4,Arrogance in the eye of the beholder,"Gould presents an interesting statistics and biology lesson which would have been more interesting in 100 less pages, but very readable nonetheless. Gould seems to ignore the key point about human evolution until a few pages at the very end of the book. Consciousness is surely an evolutionary leap of the most revolutionary kind within evolution. Are humans really arrogant for feeling this specialness? Only if they ignore their relatedness to the rest of life, as he suggests. Fascinatingly, his take on the ""accidental"" nature of our evolution undoes the pretensions of both traditional humansists and religious believers, one seeing humankind as the apogee of a wholly material and essentially mechanical existence and the other as the center of God's wholly supernatural creation. What Gould cannot answer any more than any other scientist is from whence comes that unnameable something that sparked life and then ultimately self-conscious life"
2,"An arrogant denunciation of ""human arrogance.""","This is a rather puzzling book whose goal appears to be an attack on religious interpretations of evolution, interpretations which see God as the creator of the material and processes whose evolution results in human beings. Such a view, says Gould, is merely an expression of ""human arrogance."" Evolution doesn't work that way, and ""[h]umans are here by the luck of the draw...."" ""[T]he vast majority of replays would never produce . . . a creature with self-consciousness."" (But the universe is big--couldn't even a small minority of ""replays"" which produce self-consciousness, and we know that there has been at least one such event, be interpreted as a statistically inevitable expression of divine intent?) Does Gould participate in the ""human arrogance"" he sneers at? If so, perhaps his reasoning is less than impeccable. If he believes that he is _not_ arrogant, on the other hand, isn't that arrogant of him?À %"
4,Works fine,"It works fine. It gets a little loose after using it, but the plastic is sturdy and it suits my needs."
4,Great goni but there is one that is better!,It's a great goni but my professor uses one that I like better but others may like this one better. Im keeping this one though its no big deal!
3,www.herbdoc.com is the site,I haven't read it so I don't know how I'd rate it. I took a middle approach because the information of his that I have read seems really good. I just wanted to put his website in so you can get it cheaper. I like Amazon.com and have gotten some excellent deals from here. I cannot believe that people are selling this book for so much money when it is available for a lot less!
5,One of His Best,"This is a great Bruce Cockburn CD. His voice sounds great, not robotic like his early - mid 80s records tend to be, and the organ florishes are a nice touch. I own about 6 of his CDs and this, along with Breakfast in New Orleans, is one of my favorites.This CD is reminiscent of one of my all time favorite CDs, Dylan's ""Desire"", in terms of it's storytelling Americana fashion.The sound quality on this CD is great also. Buy it and enjoy."
4,Good,"I have had this album for several years now and still listen to it once in a while. Overall the album seems very diverse and has not disappointed me in any respect. I must admit that I do not own any other of Cockburn's records and thus cannot make any comparisons to other albums. At any rate, the music is relaxing and the album, at least in my opinion, deserves to be bought."
5,Excellent CD; diverse soundtracks.,"Very diverse sounds on this CD. Jackson Browne also provides backup to ""Indian Wars"". Very good compilation of music on this CD."
1,Not One of the Best Ones,"For some reason, this CD won UPI's Record of the Year when it came out. It must have been a slim year. Bruce has made some brilliant albums over the past 30 years, notably Humans (his best), Dancing in the Dragon's Jaws, In the Falling Dark, and Stealing Fire. This CD sounds like it was written while he was asleep--there are any number of songs herein that have the same cring-producing quality of his most embarrassing songs (see, e.g., ""Making Contact,"" from The Trouble With Normal). But don't give up on him just yet: BC's last two efforts, Dart to the Heart and Charity of Night are among the finest of his post-Humans period."
3,"Spotty, but still a few gems","This collection is more sparse and morose than other Cockburn alburms. However, I think it's worth buying for ""Child of the Wind"" alone. This track brings tears to my eyes every single time I hear it. Some angry lyrics (""Kit Carson"") come across as awkward -- like he's throwing words at the world's problems without crafting the words first. However, Bruce is miles ahead of most popular music when it comes to writing lyrics that truly say something, and make contact with the spiritual side of our human existence. This isn't his best, but I'm still looking forward to anything Cockburn releases in the future."
2,"Not making contact, losing steam...","A tired effort from an estimable singer, Burning Light is terribly earnest and earnestly aimed at listeners who can't get enough Jackson Browne. Only about four tracks out of 12 click; those about American Indians and NAFTA (?!) are awful, more lectures than songs, didactic without being a bit as bracing as If I had a Rocket Launcher. Lyrics here are sub-par: the man who wrote lines like ""gotta kick at the darkness 'til it bleeds daylight"" gives us clinkers like ""the so-called white so-called race / digs for itself a pit of disgrace"" on this album. I have 11 Bruce Cockburn albums, and hardly ever go back to this one. New listeners may find more joy (for musician and listener both) in the earlier releases."
2,A Miss,"Cockburns politics always put you on pins and needles but tunesmanship and turn of phrase save it everytime, but not this time. Unfortunately, buried is the dirge are some gems, Great Big Love, A Dream Like Mine and Somebody Touched Me show Cockburn's ability to craft songs complementary to his distinct guitar craft. Most of his recent work is a bit inconsistent, but this turned me off to future Cockburn efforts, and I have quite a few. Recommended are Human's and Stealing Fire."
1,Gave it away just to get rid of it.,"Bought it as an after-thought with another sexy DVD, which I liked very much. Good actors on this one, so expected better. After seeing it, I told my husband to just drop it in the garbage, he suggested we give it to a friend who will watch anything. Except for a couple funny lines, I thought it was a total waste of my time. Mary"
5,"Fabulous book, a real wakeup call!","I'll warn you before buying this book, you might find it to be a real wakeup call. Brother and Sister get involved in a TON of activities and are literally being drug by their parents someplace every day. Whether it's horseback riding, swimming, soccer or dance, Mama is toting them from here to there while trying to fit her own schedule into the mess. Papa helps sometimes, but he's busy with his work too. When the car finally breaks down and Sister and Brother are late for some event, Mama just goes upstairs and cries. This upsets the cubs and Brother runs off into the woods to get his Papa. Mama is okay when he arrives and they have a family meeting right then and there to decide what part of their schedules is going to be eliminated. It really helps you put into place how busy your life can become when you're not looking. Love this book in our house and we HIGHLY recommend it!"
1,Not a well written book...,"...and not for a beginner. Filled with samples and graphs-which somewhat help the extremely confusing writing style. Bradley's style reminds me of the teacher I had when I was 10 years old who found it very easy to go off on a new tangent--and very difficult to be brief, concise or clear.Fine for a reference, if you already know what you want."
3,"Not for the beginner, but still useful","I bought this book when I was still trying to get my head around XML and found it much more confusing than clarifying. However, many years later, once I had a solid foundation of XML, I pulled this book back out and actually did find it mostly useful. The author covers a lot of minutia that is difficult if not impossible to find elsewhere (he devotes an entire chapter to whitespace issues, for example), and if you really have a need to understand what is going on under the hood, this book can actually serve as a handy reference. Still, I do think the material could have been better presented - chapter 6 discusses ""Architectural Forms"", for example. I have read and re-read the explanation several times and still cannot fathom what they are or why they would be useful... there are quite a few such topics in the book."
1,Poorly written and explained,"I bought this book because I was liked the breadth of content covered. There is a lot of content there but I find the style of the author virtually unreadable. He seems completely unable to state a concept clearly and provide a clear example. The text is full of buts and howevers as the author flies off on tangents from the concept being discussed. The book is obviously designed for an advanced audience but that doesn't excuse the lack of clarity. The tangents would be far better suited to different sections or notes to avoid cluttering up the main concepts covered. Also, the examples are rarely well explained and generally consist of small chunks of code that don't illustrate the entire problem. The text would be benefitted by a better structure including more section headings to clarify the topics.Unfortunately, there is a dearth of decent books on XML right now, but this one should be avoided."
2,"If you are in any way technically minded, avoid this book!","This is not that great a book, in fact it is fairly poor. The writing is confused in places and the examples badly thought through. Technically minded readers will find it largely pointless, and will offer little of any great use. Over-rated."
4,Funny and Original Songs!!,I find this CD very interesting to listen to!! I could not believe that the person who produced and compiled this album was none other than Weird Al Yankovic!! That was a cool surprise!! The very first sonng on this CD is comical and excellent to dance to!!!! The other songs bring me back lots of memories when Lucy was doing her funny routines on the show!! I find this CD very enjoyable to Lucille Ball fans!!!!
5,its great to hear the music from lucy and desi.,this is a great cd you should by it. if you like Lucy you'll love this
5,If you ain't heard this cd you ain't liv'in!!!!!!!!!!!,I AM 11 Years old and I LOVE LUCY.YOU GOTTA BUY THIS CD IT'S LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT AND LUCY!!!!!!!!!!!!Did you know that they're making a movie about Lucy and Julia Roberts may be starring as LUCY?!!!!!!!!
2,Only for TV Theme Song Junkies,"I enjoy Desi Arnaz's music, and I adore I Love Lucy. But this CD is really not that interesting except as a novelty or as TV memorabilia. What proves interesting or funny in the show is a bit annoying when just heard on disc."
1,IS THIS MOVIE FOR REAL???,"After playing it for several minutes I had to pick my chin up off the floor.Unreal is all i can say!It's the weirdest home video/kid movie ever made and I swear the adult clown is totally drunk. It's worth a fewbucks just to get a good laugh at how bizzare this movie is, then toss it. It's like a bad trip."
1,This goes straight to trash,"Poor quality, no words for sing-a-long, lousy songs, lousy props. Dont waste a cent for this [...]."
3,My baby loves it....,"What has been said about the video in the negative reviews is true, but my baby loves it. Babies aren't looking for Daytime Emmy winning performances. The music is familiar (backing tracks sounded just like Barney), the singing decent, and the garish face painting is colorful enough to get a baby's attention. Most of the video is just some kids and characters playing outside like you see in the clips on Sesame Street. If your baby likes music and the price of the DVD isn't too high, it's not the worst thing you could do to buy it."
1,WORST VIDEO EVER!!!!,"ABSOLUTE WORST VIDEO EVER! The cover is misleading. If only the video looked half as good as the cover. That cute, clean child isn't even in the video. The quality of this video makes me think a family tried to make their own video. Creepy clowns chase the kids around. This video is now known by our friends and family as the worst video ever. DO NOT BUY."
1,Creepy!,"My daughter loves it but I was creeped out. I wanted to throw it in the trash...I'm conflicted. I couldn't help but laugh when a bunch of unathletic kids tried to jump over lit candles...the beginning song shows a bunch of weird kids in weird face paint wandering around the weirdest little village I've ever seen. Very trashy, creepy video. My first thought was to throw it away. Why does my daughter like this?"
1,"Creepy, Terrible, Not Worth 50 Cents","I was hoping for a video that would encourage my son to get up and dance while listening to his favorite songs. This video is sooo creepy! Face-painted kids (scary!), stories that don't sync up to the story teller's lips, the giant characters look drunk, etc. The cover art makes it look like a video that has some production value. In truth, it has NONE. Not worth whatever it is that you might pay for this. It's awful. Take a pass. I have it on now and it's making me nauseous.I might play this on Halloween to scare people."
1,Low Budget Rip-Off,"This shoestring budget video was a huge disappointment - it literally was the worst DVD we ever bought. We bought this for our 2 year old, because the cover suggested that this was a sing-a-long for pre-schoolers. Instead, it appeared to be nothing more than some amateurs telling stories and singing and boring our poor children to tears. Save your money and buy something with an eye to production value."
2,Hilariously bad,"I'm torn. In some ways, it's worth 5 stars. I laughed so hard that I almost peed my pants. But in reality, it's a 1 star video. My mother-in-law sent it to my son. He is only 8 months old, so he's not interested in television yet, but for some reason my husband and I decided to put it in anyway. I'm glad we did, and not because it's a quality video, but because it was hilariously bad.Some highlights:- Kids jumping over a lit candle. Oh what fun!- That drunk looking mullet-having clown...OMG!- A disturbing man with the umbrella chasing a kid.- The horrifying face paint. What is the deal with that?!- A teenage girl WAY too old to be participating in this.- Those costume beasts romping around.Now I am curious about who made this. Who are these people?!? How did this get filmed and distributed?"
1,Scary faces,This movie is not a good movie for children who do not like masks. My children were so scared of the painted faces!
1,Horrible kids dvd,It is the worst dvd i have ever seen for kids..it is soo boring...there are 2 stories in between which is such a stupid.. face painting is scary too. the out fit they have used is so silly..it is simply a waste of money..
2,Amatuer-ish,Video footage looks like it's from someone's home videos. Face painting is a little scary too. Audio is above average but has little coordination with video footage. Kid's may actually watch it a couple times but parents will be not happy with this video.
3,Don't be so quick to judge!,"While I agree that the video is brutal, my 3-year-old daughter LOVES LOVES LOVES it! She has never been a TV watcher, but this video absolutely enthralls her. She sits and watches it with the biggest smile on her face. She hops like a frog with the kids, she does the eensy-weensy spider, and she jumps over the candlestick like Jack. Mommies, our kid are who they are. We may not understand why they like what they do, but we need to support them in their interests. So-pop in this DVD, sit back, and enjoy this seriously low-budget production with a sense of humor."
4,Kids Love it,"The DVD features brightly dressed and very animated children, adults, and animals. The songs which are quite rythmic and upbeat should be familiar to most adults and are very appealing to most toddlers. Each song or story is aligned with a letter in the alphabet. The children in the feature are in the age group from toddlers to pre-teens.One nice feature of this DVD format is that it will automatically re-start a few minutes after the main features are finished."
1,Vanity press and throwback to old-style biblical archaelogy,"This is not a scholarly study, but an attempt to try to ""prove"" the Bible by selecting similarities between certain passages in the Bible and actual events. As a friend of mine put it, the fact that Kansas really exists does not prove that the ""Wizard of Oz"" is a true story."
3,Just too big,I love this Bible but I wanted a version that was smaller and easier to travel with (I never check luggage). This was just too big for my carry-on so I had to send it back. It really was not much smaller than the whole big Message Bible I already have and it is bigger than some other whole Bibles i own. Thank you Amazon for making returns so easy - I've never returned items to you before and this was a breeze!
4,Great King James Backup,As a reader of the King James I sometimes find it hard to really understand the scripture; by going to the Message Bible I can read the scriptures in todays language that gives me a clearer picture of what the scripture means. One of the many good backups to the King James. I among many wish the print was a little larger.
4,Good reading!,"The Message: The Bible in Contemporary LanguageExcellent product. However, I use it in conjunction with my NIV Bible to clarify the scriptures further."
5,An exciting tool for study!,"This wonderful ""rendering in contemporary language"" increases the desire to study more deeply. You will find yourself challenged to explore the previous translations to determine why you missed a point, or to prove the rendering inaccurate. Regardless of the outcome, you will pull the Testament out again and again for the sheer joy of study.The easy reading will also be a blessing to new converts and those who have had trouble with the other translations."
3,"OK Paraphrase, Misses Southern Idiom","Peterson uses what he believes are modern idomatic expressions to make clear the Biblical text. For us Southerners, he misses the mark over and over. It's sometimes funny when he combines two different expressions or mangles the end of a common expression. You can tell he is an academic who researched American idomatic expression instead of getting out and actually talking to us. The text didn't flow for me and that is the most important aspect in a paraphrase. I had to quit in Romans.If you're really interested in a paraphrase, go for JB Phillip's Translation in Modern English. No gimmicky expressions, just excellent use of the English language."
3,Problems With Kindle Version,"Have gained much from ""The Message"" over the years. The Kindle version however is badly in need of a tune-up. It is especially difficult to navigate amongst the Psalms. The transition from the written page to the electronic page was poorly executed with large caps between some words and none between others. There are typos and smudges that came directly from the scanner. This book needs to be redone directly from a digital form and not OCR'd."
5,A good tool to read along with other translations.,"When I first read it I was sort of put off by some of the idioms. I didn't read it again until I was studying Psalms. I read each chapter in New American Standard, then the Jewish translation, Tanakh, then this one, and finally,in the New Living Translation. By the time I do all that I really know what it says. I had found some of my best understanding is from reading The Message. As a result of that experience, I am now reading it just by itself from start to finish and find it not only illuminating but a lot of fun."
3,Pie in the sky by and by???,"""The Message"" does bring clarity to some of the less understandable passages in the Bible. The author appeared to have worked hard to gift us with a more readable version of this, which is from a Christian perspective, the most important of all books. I enjoyed some of the colloquialisms, such as neighbors bringing casseroles to a home where a death had occurred. But I grew weary of having the towering language of the New Testament reduced to hackneyed expressions such as the ""pie in the sky"", quoted above. If the book was written for a class in freshman English 101, I think it would get an ""A"" for sincerity and a ""C"" for word/phrase usage. Still, I'm glad I bought it. Given the author's extensive knowledge of the Bible and its language, he has provided a new understanding, as he set out to do."
5,must read,"It is so enjoyable to read this version, I bought a copy for my 20-something son and for my daughter. They love reading the Bible in contemporary language. Really brings the message home....pun intended!"
3,message New Testament,Thisedition doesn't show verse numbers for when you look them up------grrrrrr Would not recommend to other Bible class members
5,I love this version!,"I should have checked out the inside before buying, the verses aren't numbered in this one! It's AWESOME for reading, just not so great for looking up particular stuff."
2,The Message Bible,This is a wonderful Bible for reading in modern language - although be sure to compare it with other Bibles written in the times of the author. The only problem with this Bible - and I had to return it - was that I had purchased it for an elderly person and she was not able to read the small print. The print shown was from a different Message Bible.
5,"Text, context and commentary, all in one!","The Message presents a unique opportunity to understand timeless biblical truth in today's context. Peterson has incorporated sound exposition into the text he offers. The result is a naturally flowing understanding that previously required diligent study of both text and commentary. While some are not comfortable with Peterson's unconventional blending of language, meaning and context, I submit this version of the bible is a faithful witness to the message the bible reveals. This version is excellent for those who have never read the bible before, those who seek to go deeper into scripture and those who would study and comment on the bible academically."
4,A great companion to read along with your Bible...,I have found that having The Message along side my Bible helps me to really understand what the Bible is saying. Peterson's translation into contemporary English helps one fully understand the intended meaning of any passage in the Bible.
4,Check dimensions before you order!,"This is a ""pocket edition"" but I didn't realize that meant the dimensions are tiny(5X3)! If I had bothered looking at the full description I would have known this but I falsely assumed ""pocket"" just meant small, like a regular paperback book. This edition literally fits in your shirt pocket and the writing is tiny. Not exactly what I expected."
5,Reads like a novel,"I am a Bible student and love studying the Word of God. Sometimes, after reading many passages over and over, it helps to have a new perspective. The Message Bible is written in modern day language (english) and is very easy to understand. It makes the Bible all fresh again. After reading several chapters in The Message, I check it out in NAS and usually find that the same thing is said in a different way. I especially love the gospels in The Message. Only problem, start to read just for a few minutes and end up reading for an hour or more. Great work by Mr. Peterson which I believe was definitely inspired by God."
3,An excellent translation....,"provided that one is OK with seeing a parable butchered and the poetic imagery of one's favorite psalm wrecked. If people like this translation fantastic but I will never be a fan. I hope it leads you to better translations that don't try as hard to be contemporary To me ""The Message"" isn't a bad thing in and of itself it just reminds me of the same transitory trendiness that bought us (by which I mean Christians in the United States) the Prayer of Jabez and The Purpose Driven Life.Overall-A Good first step but this shouldn't be the only translation you ever pick up."
2,Not horrible but . . .,"I don't like this version. My teenage daughter doesn't like this version. My husband won't read it because the print is too small, but he probably wouldn't mind it too much. Maybe our take on it isn't all that typical because we really don't like paraphrases as a rule, but reading this version seriously irritates me. If you don't readily remember what the Bible really says in this or that passage, it might not affect you that way.It's not that the Message is heretical or anything. It's just way too coloquial and often too shallow for me. It'll be out-of-date within ten years if not sooner. As I said, it's not horrible, but if you want the depth of God's word, which is so incredible and rich and has so many nuances and shades of meaning, and is truly and literally alive, this is *absolutely* not the version for you. If you want an easy read (and sometimes we do), and if you're not too picky about getting the whole meaning, then you might enjoy it.God Bless,Cindy"
3,Message New Testament/Psalms/Proverbs,I didn't realize how small it was. If I had known the size I would not have ordered it. It may have told me somewhere but since I have a larger one just like it I wrongly assumed this one was the same size.
5,Great tool,"I would not recommend this as your sole Bible Study resource, but as a companion to your regular Bible it's great. Very easy to read and clarifies lots of puzzling passages. And it's a great read."
1,Worlds worst interpretation on the market!,This man... did a terrible job trying to interpret a book that needs none. All sense of the majestic Word is lost. The Message... is lost in here....do not buy this product...
2,"It's a Summary, not a Translation","This is NOT the word of God. It is a combination summary/commentary written on a 6th grade level. It may be an excellent choice for someone who is ""almost"" interested in checking out what the Bible says (like I was 14 years ago when I bought The Book), but it is not an accurate translation. Perhaps it is a good stepping stone to get conversation/thought started with a seeker. It certainly is not the least bit intimidating."
1,Blasphemy,This Bible is nothing but utter Blasphemy. If you want to pollute your minds by reading this go for it but it is a waste of money of time. If you truly want a good Bible go for ESV or NKJV. These tell you the truth not crap!
3,The Message,"""The Message"" I could not read the type. It was much smaller than sample shown on screen. That was incorrect information. I had to take it to a local book store and trade it in on a copy with the correct type size. That transaction cost me more than if I had purchased it locally in the beginning. I was not happy."
4,Kindle Version,"I purchased The Message version of the Bible for one of my kids and enjoyed reading parts of it so I decided to buy the Kindle version for myself. I would not necessarily use this version exclusively but the translation often brings passages to life and opens another door for understanding. I love it when God breathes new life into a passage that I've read often. However, the Kindle version only has headings instead of chapter and verses in the table of contents so I've read it more as a book than as a resource. I've wished a few times that I could compare a certain verse with another translation but I've also enjoyed reading the New Testament through in a new way. I suppose I could have another Bible close by while I read The Message to keep track of where I am but have not done so. I would recommend the Kindle version only as a reader."
4,Easy read,"I selected this book because of the modern language used. It was a gift to a friend who was having difficulty reading his version of the Bible on a regular basis. He is finding this MUCH easier, since it reads more like a book.Only concern is the size of the print, but that doesn't seem to bother him.Good choice for new Christians or people in need of re-energizing their Bible study."
5,The Message is Awesome!!,"I was reading a bible study online and I read a quote from ""The Message"". I had never heard of it before. I love it!!! Up to date language...makes a lot more sense than the ""thee's"" and ""thou's"". If you don't want to struggle understanding the New Testament..you have to get one. The price is right too."
3,nice bible,its a nice bible. im so used to the king james version that this bible seems too simple to read. for now i will stick with my king james version. it was delivered on time. but seems like its not my type of a bible probably end up gifting it to someone else.
3,Not what was expected,"The title and author were what I wanted, but, unfortunately, neither the listing nor description of this book indicates the fact that it is only the New Testament, as opposed to the whole Bible, which is what I want and need for an ongoing project. [The cover of the book makes this clear, but was not large enough to read on the web.] Very disappointing omission!"
4,A fine companion piece,"Pastor Peterson hasn't created the perfect modern day biblical translation. That job is still yet to be done. While we do lose much of the poetry we are used to, Peterson does render the New Testament in a completely accessible form that frequently reads like a living and breathing contemporary novel. He should have employed a few more collaborators and editors on the work, but it is still an impressive achievement and a good read.Should this be the only text one studies with? Of course not. But it does serve as a starting off point for one's religious exploration and study. ""The Message"" of Salvation through the living Christ rings loud and true in this new translation.I do disagree with some of the negative reviewers. I certainly grasped in this translation, Christ's true divinity. I also grasped for the first time, a real sense of Paul and his position of doctrine and devotion. I reccomend the book not as an end all and be all, but as fine, accessible introduction."
3,bible studies,the Message is to small of print making this hard to read. the way it is writen is easy to find what you are looking for
1,False product identification,"Warning! As others have mentioned, this is only the New Testament, Psalms and Proverbs. It doesn't tell you that on the product page. Sorry, but if it doesn't have the Old Testament, it's not a Bible."
2,Straight Message Required,"If you want the Holy Spirit to guide your mind as you study, dont start with ""Message"". While the language is colorful and rich with contemporary imagery, it robs the reader of the historical, cultural groundings [which narrows the breadth of thought and intellectual challenge], and some interpretations can be misleading. Caution is prudent with single person interpretation of important things. And, yes, the ads need to be clearer that it is a portion of the Bile - not the full thing."
5,"Bible, relevant and contempory","I've studied the Bible for 30 years and have always used the traditional versions (NASB, NKJV) The Message has been a definate plus as I've enjoyed comparing the different contents. Eugene Peterson has done an excellent job of translating the Bible in a manner that not only draws readers, but is easy to understand and apply. It has a great place in daily reflections."
4,Story book form,"This is an easy way to ""read"" the bible is storybook form. I do not recommend it as a study bible, but it certainly makes a good read on the go. Sometimes it's good to get another version of the word when you're studying the bible. This book helps to add clarity and picture what you're reading. I would recommend this to others."
2,A failed rendering,"Peterson's attempt to render the Bible into the ""informal"" fails, in my opinion. Contemporary English is one thing. Idiomatic English falling into slang and the inarticulate emphatic language pattens of the completely uneducated is another. This is most glaring in the Psalms and Proverbs. What should be beautiful and pithy become commonplace. Peterson's methods work well in the pastoral Pauline letters, for the most part, as they are suited to the subject matter of those epistles. I'm afraid this waters down the rest of the Bible, however. Think of this as ""The Living Bible"" translation with a street attitude. Yuck."
1,Making poetry into street slang . . .,Why do we have to take poetry and turn it into dribble? Is it understandable? Yes. But it does nothing for me. All the beauty is gone and only cheap words remain. This is a comic book edition of the scripture. Don't waste your time.
3,Reading The Message,"I didn't realize that the print would be so small. This information may have been given, but if it was, I overlooked it. The content is wonderful and so easy to understand."
1,The Bible for dummies,"People praise this book because its ""easy to read"" and because they can understand it better then a real Bible. This is hogwash people. Would you buy a dumb down version of The Lord of the Rings because you couldn't understand it how Tolkien wrote it? Would you water down Hamlet to make it easier to read? NO! This is NOT a Bible, it is one mans, yes, ONE MANS interpretation of what HE thinks the Bible means. Putting the words of God into ""plain, everyday language"" by changing his words in the end changes the ideas and meanings themselves, thus making this book irrelevant to any serious Christian. Sure, you can read this book for entertainment purposes and such, but for goodness sake do NOT use it for Bible study, for church, and for converting others. This is nothing more then a watered down, dummyfied version of the Bible that I for one refuse to ever use again.Re-read value; medium."
2,TINY!,"I saw in a previous review the type was TINY but thought--my eyesight is fine and it won't be a problem. The book is about 6 inches tall and the type is TINY! Good news is I can carry it around in my purse to read while waiting in line, for the doc, or whatnot. But I would recommend getting a ""normal"" size print."
2,Frustrating,I am quite enjoying this book but not enjoying the typographical errors. There are so many that it is distracting and extremely annoying. Doesn't anyone edit these e-books?
5,A great Australian saga,"This book is an in depth read into the life of Adam Ross, orphaned at 9. It reads brilliantly and has the most beautiful descriptions of the Australian outback. I remember reading it when I was about 13 and I couldn't put it down. Ten years on and I can still enjoy it just as much, although the words now make more sense!The only advice I can give is to not purchase the ebook version as there are countless spelling errors. I would say at least 10 per page. It's incredibly frustrating as it looks like someone used predictive text to re-write the electronic version! Purchase a copy from a bookstore as it is a fantastic read."
2,annoying spelling errors,so many spelling errors made reading this great story disjointed. Some words couldn't be recognised they were so mangled. Such a shame! My advice is avoid the digital download and go for the hard copy.
5,Quality,"I bought this print for a family member who loves the Biltmore Estate with it's gorgeous scenery. It arrived quickly and was a quality print. We had it framed for her and it's beautiful! By doing this, we saved 1/3 of what the cost was for this print on the Estate.Thanks!"
3,Cute but teetery,"Super-cute shoe. Heel has great shape and is not too high. Sole has a lot of flex, which makes them a bit teetery. You wouldn't want to have to run in them."
4,A tale of courage and sacrifice,"A well written narrative about the British troops fighting overwhelming Japanese forces as they withdraw into Singapore. Extraordinarily detailed and strong in the oral tradition of history. Plain to see that years of research and documentation gives the real truth of what happened on the front lines as the British Empire collapsed in Malaya. Authors also give vivid accounts of the prisoners used as slaves by the Japanese on the infamous ""Death Railway."" One can readily see the day by day account as these gallant men fought and died... and then were abandoned and falsely maligned by their country's leaders."
3,Warning: Excellent Film Ruined by Dubbing,Imagine my disappointment to find that this unusual film starring Simone Signoret (whose voice is so memorable) had been dubbed into English for some unimaginable reason.
1,vague platitudes,"I read about this book in a magazine and was encouraged by the positive reviews on Amazon.com. I suppose someone who hasn't read much about spirituality or the mind-body connection might find some useful information within these pages. Otherwise, save your money. There is actually very little specific information to aid one in designing a new lifestyle."
4,Cool jazz associated with a classic fairy tale!,"I was lucky enough to see this TV event when I was a child (1950's), and got the record a few years later. The music ranges from ballads to jazz, lovesongs to pointed commentary (ie:taxes and work-day break times), operaesque themes to plain silly stuff. The recording is slightly hollow sounding, but the lyrics are easy to hear and understand, and the music lovely. I feel that it compares well with the Disney ""Aladdin"", since each has some inside jokes that fit into the time period when the music was composed. I give it 4 stars."
3,"As Sandburg was, Vidal was a novelist . . .","and that is how I watched it. I am a Lincoln ""buff,"" so it is a significant part of my Lincoln library. I look forward to Spielberg's Lincoln, which is based more accurately on history."
4,Historical Lincoln,"Iam interested in our American history, especially Lincoln and the Civil War.And comparing the difference in movie making is also fascinating.The acting was pretty good, too"
1,"HORRIBLE DVD RESOLUTION, SEEMS TO BE A BOOTLEG COPY","This DVD appears to be a pirated dvd, copied from a master, verified by my television producing husband. I bought this dvd last year to watch with my homeschooled daughter and because it's 3 hours long, didn't get to it last year. But, when we finally did try to watch it, it's so visually distorted that it seems that you are watching it through a foggy yellow lens.Awful, awful. And, what's worse is that because I didn't have a chance to watch it earlier, I CAN'T EVEN RETURN IT!Don't buy this dvd from this source!! Buyer BEWARE!"
1,Very bad Qaulity,"I personally would not have even attempted to market this to others, with the copying from VHS to DVD having such a horrible end result. I have tosed it in the garbage can."
2,"Hal Holbrooks ""Sandburgs Lincoln"" on DVD tops them all","Hal Holbrooks ""Sandburgs Lincoln"" on DVD tops them all. Watterson is okay, Mary Tyler Moore as Mrs. Lincoln - they cant be serious > Gore Vidal sickens me."
3,Disappointing,"The DVD said right up front that the quality was not very good but the best restoration that could be done. It was distracting at first but as I watched it I sort of forgot about it. It was better in some areas than others. I like Sam Waterston but just did not ""get"" his performance as Lincoln at all. He looked the part o.k. Just wasn't convincing in the role. Actually, Mary Tyler Moore, (big surprise) made a better Mary and gave it just the touch of ""manic"" that is required. Not physically suited for the role at all of course. I had hoped for more of Lincoln's early life as I had not read Vidal's book. I have read many books about Lincoln. Just not this one. I hadn't realized that this was all set during the few years preceding and during the Civil War. That is my fault and not the fault of the movie."
4,"Great film adaptation, poor quality DVD","Right on the packaging, the producers apologize for the poor quality of the DVD, which was transferred from a low quality source. Still, it's watchable thanks to a compelling direction and great casting. Perhaps one day, someone will take the time to digitally remaster the original film or tape."
2,Gore Vidal's Lincoln DVD,"An excellent made-for-TV film, which is well-written and well-acted. The 1.33:1 DVD has poor picture, hence the two-star rating."
5,A spiritual kick-in-the-pants,"Written for Christian ministers, ""Ablaze for God"" is one of those books that is born out of a close relationship with God. Wesley Duewel obviously has many years of ministry experience yet is not jaded. Instead, he imparts a spiritual strength and encouragement in his words. Don't expect much practical advice, but expect lots of inspiration to keep you going in your ministry. I guarantee that the spiritual character of this book will show up in your public and private messages."
5,Book,I received this book in the shape as discribed. It arrived within 5 days from order. thank you very much. Wesley L. Duewel is on of my favorite authors. This is a very good read. Recommend reading anything he has written.
1,trip of a movie,i watched this film while just channel surfing&it got my attention for it's vibe but after a while I couldn't tell where it was going or wanted to be?but anyway it was a trip out film.seemed put together in spots.
2,Fear The Glover,"This movie is so strange I , dont feel as if I could explain it at all. I guess you could say it's just one of those movies you have to see for yourself? I thought Jake Busey was really good in this and his acting was amazing, but the movie just had no plot. I honestly felt uncomfortable watching this. It has way to many porn scenes, and some very gross humor. Crispin Glover stole the show, he was awesome in this movie ,but I dont know if he could save it from being trash on film. There is also a very neat little cameo by the legendary punk band Fear which is really cool. All in all I gave Fast Sofa a 2 out of 5 stars and I think that was pretty nice of me............This is what you would call a pass.PS: The way this movie ends is just plain out lame.It almost feels like they just ran out of money and stoped filming."
3,Bachata #1's,Not as exciting as I imagined....nevertheless it is Bachata Hits which is what I ordered.
3,Miss Liberty,"I bought this album because it brings back memories of seeingthis show on the stage when I was in my 20's (several years ago!)Sadly, the songs are dated exept for ""Old fashioned walk' Butthe leads with Eddie Albert and his love interest were enjoyable.Unless it holds memories for you, you might let it pass."
1,Everything that's bad about IBM,"This is so typically IBM - a total lack of appreciation of the needs of the reader leading to a book that may well contain the information, but makes it near-impossible to find or use. This was a bad book before they updated it and merged in all three major platforms, but now it's just vile - big blocks of platform-specific material that you have to skip past make it a real chore to read.The grammar is poor - if this book had a professional editor, they should be deeply ashamed. Much of the content is warmed-over material from the (also poor) official reference materials, and there is no real narrative structure. Finally, even the indexing is weak.Don't waste your money - the online reference books have all the material, and Google will find you more helpful explanatory material."
3,Long Ago in Oregon,"Written in a poetry format, but without a poetry style. Random thoughts of a young girl providing minimum information of the time frame."
4,Worthy Cause and Serious Story,"In this book Batman is frustrated that his battle against crime is not enough. As billionaire Bruce Wayne, Batman meets social worker Debra Kane, who claims child abuse is the root of crime. Intrigued, Batman goes after child porn only to learn from his trusted servant, Alfred that Batman's mother had been after this same group when she died. Beware this books does has some strong language and some violence.The author Mr. Vachss is a child advocacy crusader and the author of crime fiction. This novel was written to raise awareness of the pedophilia problem overall and the Thai child exploitation problem. There is a non-fiction child sex tourism report included as an appendix to this book that drives this point home. This book is a good read, but for adults."
1,Not Good,"As a Batman fan for more than thirty years I've read every novelization of the character I can get my hands on. This is one I wish I hadn't read. Actually I picked this up at the local library so I was spared having to buy it. The long and short of it is, there are good Batman novels out there. This ain't one of them."
1,What's missing here?,"Yes, the underlying story is important and needs to be told. No, it wasn't the right place or character to tell the story.Old Friend Alfred starting getting on my nerves by about page 30. The author's use of diverse language appears to have taken second place to the ""message"" he wished to communicate and in doing so kept me from enjoying this novel. I closed the last page with a feeling of relief that I had finished rather than relief that the character lives on."
1,Simplistic and clichéd,"If there's a hero that deserves to be praised, that is Batman. There's a lot that has been said about his persona, alter-ego, symbolism, etc.; that's why, being such a deep and grown up character, it is a shame that he has to stand this simplistic, boring and obvious story. That the story is about child pornography? Yes, it is, but the way it is treated is so absurd that it's almost the Reader's Digest version of the problem. It's not exactly the same, but in Batman's Night Cries (a much much better story) the problem of child molestation is presented in a much more mature and interesting form, and dealt with in a form we suppose Batman would. Mr. Vachs has never been that good so not much can be expected, but this story is a waste of money, and, worst of all, a waste of an incredibly interesting character."
4,Super Reader,"A look through the eyes of the Batman at the horrendous world of the child sex trade, and child abuse in parts of Asia.This involves crime so nasty that it takes Batman out of Gotham and pursuing this particular bunch of criminals across the world. It has a few things to say about the politics and law-enforcement environments that surround such activities."
2,Not up to Andrew Vachss standards,"Andrew Vachss is best known for the Burke novel, dark, seedy travels through one man's psyche as he battles personal demons, as well as his prime target, child abuse. Burke does have a great deal in common with Batman; both tangle with their own twisted realities, both are vigilantes who roam the streets, both have lairs that no one may enter, both allow no one to touch them emotionally. But where Vachss invests Burke both with nobility and realism, he fails to do so with Batman. Perhaps its the fact that Batman is more superhero than mortal, more mythic than human. Maybe is the fact that he wears a cape and a rubber suit. Whatever it is, Vachss fails to invest Batman with the emotional nuances of Burke, and the novel itself becomes a tiresome treatise on the horror of child pornography. Not that the subject itself isn't worthy of attention, but Vachss has done it before and since, and all times much better."
2,There is a reason this controller costs less,"It costs less than the official Nintendo controller. Thats the only good thing about it. When I got mine for Christmas, It worked once, and never worked again. I couldnt figure out what the problem was, so I took it back to the game store, and the guy there told me that other people had the same problem!Also, the controll stick, side buttons, and A buttons are different - they are not as comfortable or as easy to use as the Nintendo's controller. I suggest you buy a controller made by Nintendo. It may cost a little more, but you can be sure, you'll love it."
5,Microcon,"this is the best control ever. it looks small but it fits my hand perfectly. The buttons dont jam. If your playing a fighting game where you need to push alot of buttons then this is the control for you. I love this control the price is also perfect, i was buying a game with my allowence and i needed an extra control so when i saw this i just wanted it. i just bought it right away. this is also a good control if you have the mobile monitor because you dont need that much space to store this. this is a must have for any gamer."
4,this is the best controler,"this is one of the most convertable controlers out on the market. it fits perfectly with your hand and it won't slip out of your hands because of the rubber on the sides of the handles. i think if you have the gamecube, buy this controler."
3,....less money....low quality,"not ever low money is low quality, but in this case the control is more big and the keys are hard to press. I buy this control, is good but not perfect, i prefer the original control more precise and easy for use.if you can buy the original control, buy it.I have 3 month with the control and it don't broke."
1,"Don't buy, this controller bites the big one.","When i first got this controller for christmas it worked fine until it broke down about a month later. This controller [stinks] because you can't relie on it to work. I've had a lot of things from mad katz, and they never work propally. My advice to you is save your money and buy a nintendo brand."
2,Broke in less than 1 month!!!,"I bought this controller on Dec. 26 and on Jan. 17 it broke. I loved the controller at first but then i broke while i was playing nhl hitz. The analoge joystick stared to mess up and then i wiggled it around and it got even worse. trust me fellas, the original one is better. not by much though because the b-button is kinda broken too. all i want i a decent controller."
1,Cheaper = better? I think not!!,This product is ok if you want to go with something very cheap. It works just as well as the regular nintendo controllers but I personally prefer the controllers nintendo makes.The controller is much larger which makes it harder to press the buttons you need to get to. There is an extra z button on the other side which they named m which i have no clue what it is used for. The grips on the side of the controller make it very uncomfortable to hold and for you serious gamers might give you blisters.The only thing that might be good about this controller is that it has about an extra foot of cord.If i were you i would spend the 5 extra bucks to but the controller nintendo makes. You will indeed be much happier with your purchase
4,"Concise, thorough, and simple","The skeleton and musculature of male and female figures illustrated in B&W photos and line drawings. Still a good reference, though some details of shading are lost in printing photos."
2,"A little archaic, not very useful for todays world.","This book is severely lacking in visual resources. Its images are few, and seem to be from the 50's. The men wear loincloths, where in a anatomy book nowadays there would be full nudity. The examples are not very illustrative. For the artist perhaps looking for that resource to occasionally reference, there are far better books nowadays."
1,Don't buy this book,"This story is a poorly told tale, set on a rickety structure to provide a venue for an interesting but not revolutionary theory. It was very disappointing."
3,Pleasant Cole Porter score - intriguing show.,"This is one of those show legends - intriguingly written, never revived, leaving only the original cast recording for us to muse over. This is the second of four extant Cole Porter original cast recordings (KISS ME KATE preceded, CAN CAN and SILK STOCKINGS followed). About half of the score is run of the mill but there are some real gems. Charlotte Greenwood excels in the humorous I SLEEP EASIER NOW and NOBODY'S CHASING ME - hymns to old age. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT MEN? is a trio for divergent attitudes concerning the male sex and a wonderful example of Porter's incisive lyric writing. There is also great wit in THEY COULDN'T COMPARE TO YOU and a lush composing moment in NO LOVER. Truly pleasant listening and lots of fun. Worth a listen."
3,"average score, Charlotte Greenwood is sensational","OUT OF THIS WORLD features a catalogue of second-rate Cole Porter songs, the cast headed by comedienne extraordinaire Charlotte Greenwood. Greenwood was the show's main saving grace on Broadway, and on the cast album she operates in the same capacity. The rest of the cast is fine and stong (William Eythe, Priscilla Gillette, William Redfield, Barbara Ashley, George Jongeyans-Gaynes and David Burns), but none equal the sparkle and finesse that Greenwood possesses. Greenwood and the cast give the score more fanfare and credibility than it deserves, none of the songs could be counted among Cole Porter's finest (remarkably ""From This Moment On"" was dropped during tryouts), but numbers like ""I Got Beauty"", ""I Sleep Easier Now"" and ""Nobody's Chasing Me"" are turned into showstoppers thanks to Miss Greenwood. Sound quality is excellent for its 1950 vintage. For completists only."
5,Great or not so great ... its Porter!,"This 'plagued' show went through a lot of issues before it finally made it to Broadway. The attraction of Charlotte Greenwood on Broadway had much to do for the amount of success the show had. Only a couple of the tunes achieved a mild amount of play, and the plot involving Greek gods didn't have a lot of appeal for the average theatre goers. However, it IS a Cole Porter show and that alone, while it may not be on the top of the list for a revival, it is a good reason to have the disc is any musical enthusiast's collection."
1,Something is not right.,"I am disapointed. This item seems to have good reviews. I believe I got a defective product and the place I bought it from on Amazon is ignoring me. I am very disappointed on them. I hope this gets resolved, but it's already been a month. It would be nice to write a review on a working model out of the box."
5,Amazing I loved this book!,I love Sixth Grade Secrets!Its my favorite book!One day i was looking around the classroom for a book to read and i thought it looked good.Now I want to own it!I'll buy it today!But i do warn you the ending stops in the middle so its like one of those books when it ends you want to read more!Maybe there will be a sequal.I sure hope so!Best book ever!5 stars!
5,Best Book Ever,Sixth Grade Secrets is about a girl named Laura who starts a club called Pig City with her friends. The club ends up being destroyed by Gabriel and the rest of Monkey Town. It's really exciting and fun to read. It's the best book I have ever read.
1,STINKS,"Here is the story. Laura Sibbe, the central character buys a gimme cap at a garage sale. The words ""Pig City"" are inscribed on the hat. She tries to start a porcine gang of Pig City followers. Gabriel, her archrival and archnemesis starts a countergang called Monkey Town. Monkey business and monkey shines abound when the two warring factions square off and some cruel actions take place. Nasty, rotten Gabriel cuts Laura's beautiful hair, forcing her to get a short, atrociously permed style. (I hated the part about her losing her beautiful hair). For reasons that were never explained to the readers at large, Laura protects the nasty peer by never telling on him.Most people liked the story, but I didn't like it."
1,Makes Light of Disturbing Violence and Bullying,There is so much violence in this book. It seems to condone violence and bullying. I was a big fan of Louis Sachar until I read this book.
3,It Is A Lid,"It is a lid. It covers things. Especially food related things, even more especially if those things are cooked in a 14"" wok. The kind folks at The Wok Shop let me exchange this for a stainless steel lid of the same size, This is very good, and I am a happy customer."
3,"Pretty nice, but holes with the handle didn't line up.","The holes in the lid didn't line up with the holes on the handle. I was able to slightly start one screw and then get the other one screwed in slightly. Then I just screwed each screw a turn and 1/2 each until they were well seated. The handle is really nice and tight now. but there are slight gaps.Right now the handle is really secure, but long term I don't know how it will be.The lid is nice and light and covers the wok well.I would still purchase this lid. Perhaps some of the holes on other peoples handles line up better, but I don't know this for sure.My review would be a five if the lid holes were precisely lined up and if I didn't have worries of future loosening since the handle is not 100% in contact with the lid."
2,Tame- a cultural mish-mash,"Yet again, I find Zendejas' characters to be trite, shallow reflections of better developed characters in similar works. I think that the lack of originality is my real disappointment with this initially promising author's work. We've heard the story before, with more credible characters and more substantive plots.In her latest book, she writes about her family and her own experiences as an immigrant. Perhaps those personal stories will have more resonance, but, here again, she is following in the footsteps of many --very talented --authors who have written superbly on immigrant experience and diaspora. I doubt that Zendejas can distinguish herself in this well covered genre."
5,I keep buying this hat every year.,"I buy one new Brewers hat every season and I wear it to work everyday. I have purchased this hat for the last three years. They do look beat up after a year, but what hat wouldn't after a years wear at a physical job."
1,Does not work,"I bot this hoping it would protect my feeder but the squirrels got right around it. At first they would fall off, but then they eventually figured it out. Also, in a windy storm my feeder and the bottom hook on the underside of the baffel fell right off. Hook is lost in the snow, had to buy a new one at hardware store. Can not recommend this. Am going to try to coat it wish vaseline or wd40, see if that works. Otherwise it is on to another feeder."
4,Keeps the squirrels away,"This works very well, but it is much smaller than my other squirrel baffles, so plan on using it with small, narrower feeders."
4,Nice and comfy,"These are comfortable. The tagless feature and the covered elastic are a big plus in my book. I thought a big help for most people would be a breakdown of what the sizes are: XL-8, L-7, M-6, S-5. I hate it when they don't give the numbers!"
4,More comfortable panties,"These panties are way comfortable, no bumps or tags. And the elastic is enclosed so it doesn't come apart and get stringy after washing. The XL size doesn't come up to my belly buttons like little girl undies. Hey, I got bigger hips after my pregnancies but I am thinner then ages and want flattering undies in size 8. These fit the bill. They are also excellently priced."
3,"cotton stretches, Go with Microfiber","I bought a few pairs of these. At first, I thought they were great (even though they have a very thick waistband which was kind of uncomfortable) but after a few months of wearing, they stretch and eventually become unwearable because they are so loose, they flap.Since then, I have bought microfiber, and am very happy with these. They have a more streamlined waistband, and are super comfortable. Most importantly, they do NOT stretch.Thank you, No Nonsense!"
1,"Your kidding, right?",is there a trick to opening the end to put the paper in then clasp with the 3 teeth? While trying to insert 600 grit 3M wet/dry paper and holding the mouth open the rubber flap broke. What was the idiot thinking when he designed this POJ. Thank God for the Preppin Weapon. I did want the smaller foot print of this block but wouldn't buy another one. I'll make one out of wood.
2,"Smells terrible, does the job though.","This is a huge hunk of rubber with ""mouths"" on each side and nails for teeth to grip the paper. The problem is the fact that this huge chunk of rubber smells terrible. If you want your room to quickly smell like someone tipped over a bottle of motor oil, then this is the sander for you. It does it's job well enough, though you might lose a finger while changing sandpaper."
4,As expected.,This CD was exactly what I expected. My son wanted it as he was in a local play of the same title. It is pretty much like all the Broadway CD's of this genre.
3,Mildly Enjoyable,"Here's Love is the last musical to complete the Meredith Wilson Broadway musical trifecta. Mr. Wilson had already written his smash hit, The Music Man and his mild success, The Unsinkable Molly Brown when he wrote, Here's Love in 1963. This is the musical version of Miracle on 34th Street. When compared to The Music Man, Here's Love can't compete, but don't be so quick to dismiss this show. Here's Love has some good numbers such as Pine Cones and Holly Berries, Arm in Arm, the title song, and She Hadda Go Back. The show is, overall, well sung and acted. Now on to the bad news. Here's Love has a lot of filler songs. It was hard for Mr. Wilson to musicalize the movie because it was some tight and compact there was little room for change. Most Broadway aficionados dismiss this show as fluff and that is what it mostly consists of. So if you are a fan of Meredith Wilson or a showtune collector like myself please pick this up. Otherwise, you might want to pass it by."
4,Please Release in the USA,"Mike & the Mechanics, if your reading this please release this album in the USA, I am in the US Navy currently on cruise on the USS Stennis and I purchased this album in Dubai(UAE). I love it! My favorite album is ""Word of Mouth"", but this ties for second with the first M&tM album. Keep them coming!"
3,Not the Best,"I agree with others, not their best work. If you read deb_b's review and agree that the absence of Paul Young damaged the album, she may be right, Paul passed away last year. I also agree that Paul Carrack needs SOMETHING and I don't know what. The soul he used to ooze and make you crank the volume has, sadly, become bland. I may be a purist but the first album is the best (is their record company ever going to wake up and put out a US Greatest Hits?!) However,I do really like songs from Beggar on a beach of gold, check it out. Leave this one alone."
2,Blah!,"If you own and love the first Mike & the Mechanics album with the same name, you will be disappointed in this one! It's a collection of lame pop songs with very predictable lyrics. ""When I Get Over You"", sung by Paul Young, is the only tune that closely resembles something original.I think Mike Rutherford is a very talented songwriter, and I've always respected his work. Unfortunately, Paul Carrack seems to be bringing out a sappy, unimaginative side to his songwriting that I'd not heard until now. If you didn't know you were listening to Mike and the Mechanics, you'd swear it was a Paul Carrack solo project - Paul Young doesn't sing nearly enough on this album!"
3,uncomfortable,this seat is darling but is uncomfortable and the hinges broke easily-disappointed with this product
2,"Not the ""next big thing""","Citing the backcover: ""Incisive, Opinonated Coverage of Applications That Have Captured the IT World's Attention"".Let's translate this: ""Superficial Enumeration of Applications"".This book does not provide any deeper information about P2P applications. Also the section about business models is not well founded and does not provide any helpful information. I was really disappointed!"
3,look for a more recent text,"The book gives a good explanation of p2p networks as they were understood at the time of writing in 2001. Napster, of course. But also Gnutella and SETI@home.However, if you are new to p2p, you may want to search out more recent texts. There has been a lot of developments since 2001. Most notably with the rise of Bram Cohen's BitTorrent, and its novel use of downloaders to act as uploaders for files. Another factor is that the use of various p2p networks did appear to lead to the music industry's weak sales in recent years. While BitTorrent is now proving to be a worry to the film studios."
2,Not what i thought,"Not very readable, didn't find it interesting, after going through the first part of the book i put it somewhere and never bothered to completely read it."
1,I can't recommend this book at all.,"Glossy pictures, looks more like a picture book, a little bit of history of some companies, absolutely no in depth information, almost no information about movements. I regret that I wasted my money on this 'book'."
1,Excellent example of incompetence,"So-called ""historic reviews"" is awful. For example - on page 156 we can read: ""In 1810, King Louis XVII of France appointed Breguet as Watchmaker to the Royal French Navy"". Did you hear about Napoleon I? Sophie Ann Terrisse (editor of the book) no. For editor information - Louis XVI were executed much earlier 1810 and next Louis XVIII claimed as King in 1814. Louis XVII never was as King in fact."
3,I'd rather have the studio cast,"after recently viewing candide in concert i took out the original cast and it was a disapointment.I'd rather have the studio cast recording because it has the stephen sondhiem lyrics aswell as the clasic bernstien music. the original only has 16 songs where as the studio cast has 34 songs, 10 more than the revival cast. my dad recieved tickets to the rvival cast directly from stephen sondhiem himself. the studio cast also has a lot of extra instrumental pieces such as the battle music."
4,"Great musical, but not the best possible recording","Candide is without a doubt one of my favorite pieces of music. Forget the show; the show itself will never work on stage. But the music really is amazing. The biggest problem is, there must be a dozen recordings of it, and not one is even remotely like another. You literally need to buy six cds just to get the full grasp of the score. This one, the first, has the best cast and the best orchestra; unfortunately, it contains all of one third of the music. Still, it is more than worth it (heck, the overture alone makes it worth it)"
5,Wow!,"This book, along with Le Ly's story itself, was incredible. It was both touching and horrifying. If you were involved with the Vietnam war in any way, you must read this book. I saw Le Ly in person, and she is truly incredible and made her book come to life even more!"
4,honest and touching portrayal of one woman's struggle,"This book is a wonderful source for those who are interested in the Vietnam War. It is more common to focus on the American experience in war; not often are the horrible occurances that Vietnamese went through emphasized in course lectures and other talks. The only problem I found while reading this book is that so many terrible situations that Hayslip went through are emphasized that the reader begins to be desensitized to the trauma. However, this book is a wonderful portrayal of one of the strongest women I have ever heard of; her background and noble quest to ""lose labels"" and reach out and help the people of Vietnam, one of the poorest countries in the world, should be heard."
1,Too Brutal,"This book was suggested by a college professor. I remember that when I finished it I just sat and cried for the brutality and pain of this young woman's life, and the inhumanity of those around her. Although it gives an honest inside look at the lives of those caught in the middle of the the war, I don't recommend the experience."
5,The Autobiography of a Former Viet Cong and Current American Citizen,"Ms. Hayslip's autobiography makes for fascinating reading, at least for this reader whose exposure to Vietnam is limited to 2 months working in Danang in 2008. It adds a valuable historical and personal perspective on the ""American War"" (as the Vietnamese refer to our Vietnam War)This is not a happy tale -- she explains unimaginable suffering, loss, sorrow, torture, cruelty, failures, and hardships amidst the struggle to survive in a time of civil war and major upheaval. Few escaped the direct or indirect effects of abuse, imprisonment or persecution by both sides. Hayslip offers a unique perspective having been a young conscript with the communist Viet Cong.Reading her story left me with with a broader perspective of Vietnamese culture and attitudes before, during, and after the war. It's a very useful read for anyone desiring a deeper understand of Vietnam, its people and recent history."
5,To Tell the Truth,I have just finished watching To Tell the Truth on the Game Show Network and this remarkable lady was on this episode. After just hearing only part of the story it brought tears to my eyes to hear that something of this nature took place which brought me to the internet to see if this book was available. I will certainly read this book very soon to hear the rest of this amazing story. God Bless Le Ly Hayslip
5,The power of healing through forgiveness...,"Le Ly Hayslip has written a tale of how the human spiritcan endure nonstop misery and, through forgiveness and compassion, can come out on top. A tale to inspire us all(me included). In many ways, Ms. Hayslip resembles my father,a man who spent his childhood living through the hellof Nazi occupied Greece and later the civil war that nearlydestroyed that country. His emigration to the Statesand his never ending desire to help others avoid the hellhe went through mirrors Le Ly Hayslips own qualities ofcaring and compassion.A lesson on how we all should, collectively and individually,think about the consequences of war and violence."
2,Once a salesman always a salesman,The book has a lot of good surface information. Unfortunately Randy doesn't really get down to specifics. He raises more questions then he answers. He talks about recognizing what your local market will buy but doesn't tell you how to figure it out. Store layout with no floor map. Which brands usually carry the best margin? He must know when to buy what at the lowest price. With all the data he collects surely he must know. But I'll bet he'll tell you if you hire his consulting firm. He sells that in the book too.
1,Written like you're starting the Wal-Mart of bicycles.,"If you are considering starting or improving a bicycle business that has as the objective making a million bucks, this might be a book for you to read. If you are thinking about a small, neighborhood bicycle business, use the money that you'd spent on this book to buy some more tires and tubes."
5,Worth your investment - A real delight!,"Having learned about the life of Leroy Anderson through the recent PBS story on his career,I was very interested to hear this famous composer's only Broadway show.This original cast recording is a gem. The majority of the songs are first rate, the perfomers are all first rate and the recording quality sounds as fine as anything on the market today. What a shame that the show had such serious problems, such as a weak book and opening with such hits as West Side Story and Music Man already running on Broadway.If you enjoy Broadway musicals and don't know this show, buy this recording. You will not be disappointed!"
2,Lame,I think it was only through morbid curiosity that I finished this book and I'm suprised that it has attracted the number of positive ratings that it has. Personally I found reading it was a fumbling write-by-numbers experience.
3,Ok Effort,"This is a Fun Book, I wish some more of this old west justice was used today. Ok so the story is a little predictable, but it is entertaining. The book moves fast and is easy to read. There is some violence that is graphically detailed. The characters are developed enough for the book to work. This is not War and Peace but a light summer read that will keep your mind off other issues for a few hours."
1,Not even 1 star,"wow, this is a bad book. I picked it up because I read Quentin Tarantino raving about it, knowing he likes Elmore Leonard I thought I'd give it a whirl. Couldn't finish my whirl. The patheticness of this ""strong"" female character was astounding. It's a shame. Weak writing on top of a weak (and dumb) story. Maybe they'll make a movie out of it and Anthony Hopkins can overact in this one too."
3,If you like this...,"... try books by Christopher Hyde (""A Gathering of Saints"", etc). Holt and Hyde are one and the same. :)"
4,Want to learn how Public Safety agencies are limited,"I found of greatest importance the underlying story of how poorly Public Safety agencies are linked and share important info. Also, I found it sad to see the hunter become like the hunted - did she too fit the profile?"
1,3M 343 Scotch Carpet Tape,The product was returned because the label stated that the tape could possibly make marks and/or remove the finish from a hardwood floor. That information was not given in the Amazon description.
3,Not too strong,It doesn't work as well as I had hoped and doesn't stick to my kitchen rug to the non slip pad.
3,We'll See,"This seems to be ""okay"" tape - but, too soon to tell - I guess time will provide the real answer..."
2,very difficult to seperate,I had a hard time getting the paper off the tape. I finally had to get an exacto knife to seperate the tape from the paper.
5,excellent basic instruction,"We bought this as a replacement for a VHS purchased back in the 90s. I find the moves well demonstrated and easy to follow even if it did take me a long time to become technically competent at some of them. It's a great introductory course to belly dancing AND you can reminisce about the liquid sequins and stretch velour of the 80s while watching. My posture and flexibility have improved enormously since I started regularly doing every section of the dvd. I took up belly dance in my very late 40s. I find it helps tremendously with a lot of menopausal self-image issues and Magical Motion is great in that it's low key, doesn't push too hard, is reasonably comprehensive and allows you to master moves at your own pace."
5,must have dvd,The Magical Motion Belly Dance istructional dvd's are an absolute must have for anyone new to the dance form. The moves are clearly desscribed and demonstrated by Atea and the other dancers. Don't pass this dvd up if you want a terrific home study tool!!
3,"Not great, but ok","I bought this when I first started to bellydance. I found the instructions great for learning the basics of bellydance, but the hairstyles and cheesy costume choices made it difficult to decide whether I should laugh or follow the instructions ;-D"
3,Not as good as I remembered....,"As far as learning from this DVD as a beginner...it's not as easy as I remembered. I found a VHS copy of this about 9 years ago. It really inspired me to bellydance.PROS:This DVD is cool because it covers a little bit of everything. history, basic moves, veil work, finger cymbals, costuming (80's style though) and performances.CONS: She doesn't really verbally explain what she is doing very well. I have a harder time following her moves now than I used to. Maybe I'm just stiffer at the age of 23 then I was at 14...Overall this DVD is okay. Not the best. But not terrible either. The production is about the same. Not the best, but not the worst i've seen either. It doesn't look like someone took a home video in the garage or anything like that. It's just not the most professional quality either. HEY! It was the 80's! They did the best they could!Not bad, but not my first choice."
3,good,It was informative but for me I would need to go to an actual class. I kept having to stop and rewind it over and over. didnt really feel I was getting it. But I am a begginer
5,An alcoholic hit bottom and remembering the past,"This book is a new concept compared to Sheppard's usual fiction, in that it's a short book, almost like a long zine that you can buy for cheap and read in one pass. I read this during the New York blackout, and it hit the spot because it immersed me in another world, of a Navy dropout at the end of his rope, drinking mouthwash for alcohol and trying to think back as to what went wrong. It's like a good short story, but long enough that you get some detail and depth. I also like how he tied it into his book Small Town Punk, but also described another side of the Sarasota world. This is great stuff and well worth the sub-$$ price."
5,Satisfying,"This is the perfect CD to listen to when you're driving country roads at night under a full moon. It rocks, yes, but it also sets up a mood where the individual songs don't stand out as much as the entire album creates the kind of atmosphere that could make it the soundtrack to your life. It reminds me of one of my favorite CDs, the Doves' ""Lost Souls"" which has these same qualities and is almost symphonic in its effect."
4,very good...definitely don't put this on at a party,"This album is very slow and dark. The first song, Strangler, is one of only two tracks on the album that actually rock in a conventional way. They rest is really mood music. I've heard this band compared to Low and Idaho and some of those other slower bands (I won't use that stupid label critics use to lump them together). Calla reminds me more of the slower moments of Girls Against Boys. The GVSB songs ""Satin Down"" and ""Bughouse"" off of V-Lux are kind of the vibe I get from this band. I don't have any of their other albums, however. Too many CDs, too little money."
4,Notch (way) up for calla,"This album represents the obvious development of this band. For someone who hasn't heard calla, may need a few listens to identify some of the attractive and unique qualities of the misic, but for a fan of the band this is an absolute gem. It's not very hard to tell that there from NYC. This album has really established calla as a band to be exited about and keep an eye on in the future"
3,Interesting and Varied!,"This one's got some rock- ""Save Our Precious Love"", folk-""Watch The Birds"", bluesy/soul- ""What About You"", and acousticguitar gem ""Hiding Away"". It's Nice."
3,Commendable effort,Lonette McKee's album is much like her acting career: underrated and underappreciated. There's nothing wrong with her vocal skills or her songwriting...the sister is well rounded.It's worth a few rotations if you can get your hands on it.
4,Good Tripod,"This is my first tripod that I have owned and could not be happier. I've used my friend's tripods and they do not compare to this one. So far all the tilts, swivels and panning are smooth and easy to adjust. I have only used it indoors and it is quite sturdy even when fully extended. At full extension, I have a good view of the screen on the camera/camcorder (I am 5'11"" or 180cm) without breaking my back. I have been using this with a 15.9oz (~450g or 1lbs) camera/camcorder with no issues. Everything locks in place nicely and the carry bag is great. I can fit my chargers inside with the tripod. It's also nice and lightweight. I am very happy with this purchase and recommend this to any amateur photo/video enthusiast looking for a decent tripod. Hope this helps."
1,the worst,"do not buy.......this is the worst tripod i have owned. the pins that hold the short leg extension arms have fallen out. it had to insert long nails into the ends of the small arms and bend the nails so i could continue to use this piece of junk. i am looking for a new tri-pod and will not spare the cost. i gave this piece of garbage to my young daughter....she and her friends play ""reporter"" w/it. let my mistake be your good fortune....do not buy.....do not buy."
5,Down in the deep blue sea...,"Cassie, Jake, Rachel, Marco, and Tobias have been given the power to morph, change nto any animal they touch. They have to use this power to defeat the Yeerks, a slug-like species who wants to control the human race by taking over their brains. They have been through terrible things and have had strange dreams as a result. But when Cassie and Tobias start having the same dream about the sea, the Animorphs (the kids) decide to investigate. All of them (except for Tobias who is stuck as a hawk) morph dolphins and swim in the ocean looking for whoever sent those dreams. Is he friend or foe? ""The Message"" is just like all the others in the series: super thriller!"
1,put my 11yr old to sleep,"My son and I have been reading all kinds of genres since he was born..he likes mysteries which is why he picked this book for his summer reading. After about 20 mins we looked at each other and said ""what the heck is going on?"" neither one of us could follow the plot. I dont think it is hard to read, maybe just confusing. It contains some made up words and the idea of aliens need kids help by morphing into animals, is far fetched. I would not recommend this book to a child unless they are hardcore into science fiction."
3,A little disappointing,I think that this book was a little disappointing. I quess this book was a little different because they didn't really have to risk their lives in a fight. Cassie was very scared in this book. Once again Visser Three made you shiver.
5,Great kids book,"According to my 9-year old, this book is the bomb for kids between the ages of about 9 and 13 (maybe older). The author tells a vivid story and sucks children right into the book! It's great, and my 9-year old would buy it again in a heartbeat. Have a great time reading!"
5,Keep writin' Kathrine!,"This book is the best one of the Animorphs series! managed to come up with a new character, but made Ax funny, too. If you've read this book read #'s 4+5 too, to see what mischievous pranks Ax get's up to!"
3,One Voice vs. 1001 Strings: Gershwin Meets Wagner,"This Columbia recording must be Jack's last for a major studio. His leaving for a smaller, indie label may not have been for the worse, judging from this portentous production. Jack is in fine voice and definitely has the spirit of the songs in mind, but the emphasis appears to be more on the lavish orchestrations played by the ""U. K. Symphony Orchestra."" Moreover, whoever mixed these numbers clearly was less interested in showcasing Jack's voice than drowning it in a sonic sea of smothering strings and heavy brass, occasionally spelled by an equally suffocating, ""sexy"" alto saxophone from out of a 1950's movie score. On a quirky side note, three of the songs are one-minute ""Interludes"" played by pianist Fred Hersch.Had Jack been able to veto the violins, and simply employ the rhythm section accompanying him on ""Jack Jones Paints a Tribute to Tony Bennett,"" this might have been a memorable session."
2,No Method to its Madness,"With 6.4 GB of hardrive, 192 MB RAM, and 450 mhz, this machine makes no sense. What good is the fast 192 MB RAM when you only have 450 mhz and 6.4 GB hardrive. If you know nothing about computers, than I'll tell you that if your computer is 3 years old or newer, than it has atleast 20 GB hardrive. 450 mhz compared to my 950 Compaq. This belongs in a musuem as an ancient artifact, I didn't even know these were still in production. This computer gets 2 stars for programs. You would be crazy to purchase this computer for any price."
3,Super Black Isn't Super Black,"I do love this backdrop because it's dark, and heavy duty...but because it's paper I find that I still have to do some post processing work to really get that dark background I want. This is of course to be expected, but what I mean is that I prefer fabric for the darker backdrops. They absorb the light better if that is what you are going for. If you are looking for a dark backdrop, but not a totally blacked out backdrop...than this one works fabulously. And as I mentioned...the paper is heavy and durable."
4,Great product,This is a replacement for CD magazine that lasted many years. This one appears to be of similar quality and also made by Pioneer. If it lasts as long as the first one it may outlive the player!
3,"Steamy, but not her best","Having read serveral Susan Johnson's books, I have found that I either really like them or I sorry that I wasted my time reading them. I really found ""Brazen"" really lacking. There were somethings that seem so unbelievible. Like how Kit and Angela so quickly fall in love. One would think with Angela's history that she would might be scared of men. But no, she has a past that might make some men of the day blush. The love scenes did live up to the erotic genre. If you are looking for a good Susan Johnson book ckeck out ""Forbidden"""
5,Brazen,I enjoyed this book. I agree with someone that I got a little tire of hearing about the Dutch Cup and prevent pregnancy in this day and age. But it had plenty of sizzling sex and erotica. I will re-read it again.
4,Latest version does include TAB,"The current version of this songbook (with Phil on the cover) does in fact include TAB along with notation unlike the one mentioned by a previous reviewer. Solos and fills are also included and harmony parts are broken out. The songs transcribed seem to be mostly accurate if not dead on. As with a lot guitar tab I see, I question some of the fingerings but you at least have the right notes to work with.My only minor complaint is the song selection, I would prefer to dump stuff like Sarah, Do Anything You Want, and Waiting for an Alibi for something else like Black Rose, Cold Sweat, or Holy War, etc. I give it 4 stars because ultimately I wish it included more songs than it does but there is an extremely limited amount of other Thin Lizzy tab available out there so this book is certainly worth buying."
5,Awesome,I love this. I am a huge Thin Lizzy fan and I am glad to add this to my Thin Lizzy collection.
1,Not up to Fodor's usual Standards,"I would recommend this book only if you are looking for information on places to stay. If you already have accomodations booked, save your money. Restaurant and sightseeing information is readily available at the airport in numerous free publications. The book appears to have been thrown together with a lot of generic Carribean information included that does not pertain to Aruba. For example, the book tells you to use only bottled water and to avoid ice. This is ridiculous on Aruba which has an excellent public water supply system."
3,worth seeing,"Mera Lahoo is an outstanding early film starring Govinda.Govinda plays the full range of emotions and is exceptional in all.A film well worth seeing, Govinda fan or not !!!"
5,James in Michigan,"One of the better books on the subject. I recently sold my business, and found this book to be invaluable in helping me to understand what I was getting into. The authors do a good job of weaving meaningful advice in with specific tales from their experiences selling companies. The book provides a detailed road map for the the long, complicated path to selling a company."
1,BORING!,"Sorry to say but the book was very boring. In fact, I hardly got through it at all. It seemed to me the book was just written in order to gain new clients (as the writers own their own investment boutique). I definitely would not recommend this book!"
1,[stinks],I did not quiet like not all african reggae stars were on it so it is just not worth the buying.
3,Passive VGA splitter -- expect degradation!,"By its very virtue, this product is a bad idea. If by magic your VGA devices don't suffer any video degradation, count yourself lucky.Just to test, I used this to split VGA signal between a projector and an LCD monitor -- both sides attached by a mere 6-foot VGA cable. Both became darker and blurry, and making settings changes for brightness and contrast didn't help enough. Since the projector is used for a large public audience, that just wasn't acceptable.I kept this product -- but not in active use. I keep it in a spare-parts bin as an emergency backup, in the unlikely event that an active VGA splitter fails.If you want to split VGA signal, use an active vga splitter instead. Personally, I preferAten's product, they actually tested it during design phase."
3,Nice to look at...,"I'll give it 5 stars for construction and finish, but only 1 star for design and functionality - that averages out to 3 stars. To put it bluntly, the darn thing just doesn't work very well.The main problem is with the ribbed cones that are supposed to do the reaming and extract the juice - not only are the ribs too ""dull"", but the top is too rounded, so the fruit tends to slide off to the side when you push down on it, even if you twist at the same time. The unit is something of a ""rattle-trap"" as well - the cone sits loosely in the strainer, and the strainer sits loosely in the bowl, and even a slight misdirection of pressure can have unexpected consequences!My old one-piece 69-cent plastic juicer, that I picked up at the supermarket, outperforms this thing by a wide margin. The plastic unit has sharp-edged ribs and a pointed tip, and extracts every last drop of juice with minimal effort. Guess I'll be sticking with that until something better comes along."
4,"Better than average, better than most","Strong and quality built material, will probably last longer than most other manual juicers.The base and strainer are of thick steel, the top portion could be made better. The topmoves more than I wanted when performing the juicing. The holes for the strainer could besmaller. Small lemon pits will slip thru the holes. I wouldnt recommend People purchasingthis item for juicing fruits for drinking because of the tedious amount of work for one glassof drink and dealing with the smaller pits that slip thru the cracks. This item is more focusedon making sauces with acidic base with 2-3 lemons or limes."
5,Break of Dawn,"True story, very well done. Very close to actual facts. Actor portrayed Pedro J. Gonzalez great. Subject: racial injustice and corruption in Los Angeles government in 20's. This movie can very well fit in some of today's issues,approach and action by authorites. Pedro J. Gonzalez was my grandfather."
4,Good adaptation of Le Carre,"Le Carre is not Tom Clancy. I happen to like them both, but this is espionage like it probably really is. A slow political chess game."
1,boring.....too long,was very disappointed in this.... it is very misleading... this is a series not a full movie.... it is broken up in 6 different parts and you get confused and lost in the actual story... i love alec guiness and his acting and dry humor but this was not at all entertaining and was very boring to watch... you tended to fall asleep watching it.. which we did .. it took us 3 times to finally get through the whole story and the climax.... don't buy this - rent it if you can....
3,A little flat,"This version is a little flat, mostly due to poor casting. Somehow, all of the adverse characters, especially Haydon and Esterhase, seem to look alike. Who would cast an English actor for the role of a Czech patriot anyway? Obviously produced for BBC with a view of employment in mind. Look at the difference between this and Spy Who Came in From the Cold, where Richard Burton is the protagonist and a Smiley actually looks like Smiley. That said, it's hard to mess up this LeCarre masterpiece."
3,SLOW,"The movie was delivered about four days ahead of schedule. It seems a bit slow. The movie was made for TV and is long. It's divided into three DVDs and each DVD is further divided into episodes. Three DVD makes for good video quality. The first DVD contains two episodes which means you have to be awake to select the second episode when the first ends. As I said the movie is slow and I was asleep within 30 minutes of turning it on. So, when I woke up the screen was just sitting there waiting for me to select episode two. It isn't unusal for me to go to sleep watching movies, but I usually stay awake the first time watching a movie."
1,Karla's Job.,"Karla must have had a mole in this DVD's production team, who sabotaged the subtitles. If it was a Chuck Norris or Steven Segal movie, I would have no complaints, but with this spy drama's complex plot and many subtleties of the dialog, subtitles is an absolute must, even for a Brit. Not to include them (and there is no CC, either) is irresponsible as to defy belief. It seems that for the price of this set, one might expect such basic feature as subtitles, but sorry, no luck.Amazon UK sells BBC region 2 release of both, Tinker Taylor and Smiley's People for a fraction of this Acorn Media set's cost. You get the subtitles, and if one wants the sequel too, there will be enough money saved to buy an all region player on sale."
5,"The classic George Smiley ""film""","A magnificent production,great acting by Guinness,closely follows the book.Excellent interview with Le Carre (added feature).Readers who loved the book will love this movie.I watched it many times already. Be sure and buy Smiley's Peoplewhen available.A close second to this one. Lots of suspense here,in a quiet talky way. Note Le Carre's comments on how Guinnesscan even act with his back,and why the Honourable Schoolboywasn't filmed .The other spy-Smiley book Call for the Dead wasfilmed as a Deadly Affair with James Mason."
3,Strange editing,"I agree with all the positive things people have written about ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy,"" but I know the Acorn Production DVD has cut bits here and there from the original production that I watched on the TV. Just in the opening part, when Control interviews Jim Prideaux about doing a job for him, bits from the interview have been deleted. When Ricky Tarr relives his trip to Lisbon, Portugal, where he meets Irina, the action has been edited too severely for my taste.I also found the format for clicking on to each episode awkward, so that I had to watch a snippet from the previous episode. Hell, if I wanted to do that, I would just watch the previous episode again on my own."
1,Tinker Taylor Soldier Spy REGION 2,"I've seen this series and wanted a copy for veiwing at my pleasure. I know it's an excellent show, but I didn't see that this was for region 2 only when I ordered it. It was a good price but won't play on U.S. DVD players. This should be made more clear in the advertisement on Amazon.com. I'll think twice before I buy DVDs from Amazon again."
2,"Tinker,Tailor, Soldier, Spy DVD","I was unable to view the DVD, due to its not being playable on US equipment. I was very satisfied with the return policy when I sent it back."
3,I stand corrected,"I re-ordered Tinker, Tailor--fortunately! I was convinced by that one response that I had indeed received a faulty copy. It is a wonderful production, every bit as exciting as the book, and just as I remembered the original broadcase those many years ago. Too bad no one made a film version of Honourable Schoolboy--that's the best written, I think. And a far more important part of the Karla story than many people credit it for being."
5,The Great Guinness as Spy,"""Tinker Tailor"" is one of the best spy-for-tv pictures ever made (the other being its sequel ""Smiley's People""). The acting is superb; the story, gripping; and the continuity, excellent."
3,disappointing,"I ordered this because I thought of it as being a classic and because of the actors. I was disappointed however in the somewhat disconnected nature of the flow of the narrative. The shadowy nature of espionage is a given but it often leaves you almost filling in gaps.All in all, a rather disappointing experience."
4,Brilliant writing and acting,A masterpiece but you have to pay attention. Video is fair - audio is adequate except for the first episode. If only Criterion had done the transfer.
5,Terrific viewing.,"When reading some of the complaints about the pace of 24, series 3, it made me wonder how those reviewers would have got on with Tinker Taylor, Soldier, Spy, since my recollection of it - when it was originally shown on the BBC - was like watching paint dry.With that in mind I was surprised to read how well regarded this series is, in the States, and I decided to reacquaint myself with it, by purchasing the DVD set.I found the whole thing to be excellent, and it benefited greatly from being able to watch it end-to-end, without any week-long breaks. Ian Richardson puts in a sterling performance as the tea and biscuit, too-cool-for-words, bad guy, and Alec Guiness does a fine job as well, as the dogged investigator. The broad range of acting styles adds a great deal of colour to the series, and goes well beyond the simple archetypes of 24. And I recognised Patrick Stewart ( Jean Luc Picard) as karla.I enjoyed this series, and will be getting Smiley’s People, in the near future."
5,A must for LeCarre readers.,Sir Alec Guinness does such a super job personifying Smiley. Other actors and the portrayal of the book made it quite enjoyable for me.
1,So slow I fell asleep,"I stayed awake through the first episode and wondered when anything interesting would happen. The second episode I fell asleep. My husband and I agreed how incredibly boring this was. We both like ""intellectual"" movies. I hate car chases and violence, but I do like a good thriller/mystery that requires me to think and be in awe at all the facets of the film. Maybe if I could have stayed awake, I might have found all that here. It was just so boring it put me to sleep."
5,As good as rumoured,"I read the book, saw Gary Oldman's movie and loved them both - my favourite film critics said the movie was great, but not as good as Alec Guiness' tv series of 30 years ago. So I bought it - and I agree. Absolutely superb.The quality of 1979 video onto DVD isn't great, but the script and the acting are just tremendous. Highly recommended."
5,Where Character counts,"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier Spy was written by John LeCarre in the late 60's early 70's. It documents the low point of the British Secret Service and the very height of the author's powers. Originally shown as a mini-series under the BBC brand, it is faithful to the book. There are no car chases, no shoot outs, or plane crashes. The drama is provided as George Smiley is tasked with investigating the possibility that the Secret Service has been penetrated by a Russian agent. In order to accomplish his task Smiley must revisit people and scenes from his past. In many ways it is a film noir whodunit, where nothing is quite as it seems. George Smiley is personified by Sir Alec Guiness. After the BBC series LeCarre subsequently dedicated another book, ""The Secret Pilgrim"" to Guiness.This is the real thing. If you are looking forward to the release of the 2011 version of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy this version is probably not for you."
5,Tinker tailor Soldier Spy,"You may have seen the TV series Spooks (fits it into an hour) everything going like clockwork,this is not like that! This is how it really happens, Alec at his best. Should be watched by people who can do a crossword and enjoy solving it!"
1,Wrong Region to View,"We were so looking forward to comparing this version with the remake. However, we are unable to play it on our DVD player as we are in the wrong region. I guess I would have thought they would not have mailed this version to the USA without warning us! Guess we will have to absorb the expense. thankfully it was not eemsive"
1,DVD Region,"Beware the Region code of the DVD. I ordered this item and failed to notice the following disclaimer: ""This DVD will not play on most DVD players sold in the US or Canada [Region 1]. This item requires a region specific or multi-region DVD player and compatible TV""."
5,A great DVD that has been available for over a year.,"This DVD is already out and so is Smiley's People. Both are must purchases. Great acting, very suspenseful, completely different than any James Bond story."
5,Alec Guinness owns George Smiley,"This series defines Le Carre. Alec Guinness's depiction of George Smiley will haunt your every thought and mood after you see this. He brings out the inner spy and the closeted British gentleman in every viewer, no matter what his or her background.It is shocking that Guinness had any other roles besides this. I completely believed he was a former spy.I rarely want to see a movie or TV show again, no matter how good it is. But this is one series that I *do* want to see again.Do not bother seeing the 2011-2012 remake."
5,"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy: Consummate TV Portrayals","For acting at its best, you must watch Alec Guinness breathe life into George Smiley and the world of the Circus, the British Secret Intelligence Service. His brilliant performance is superbly supported by an equally stellar cast. Like a giant zigsaw puzzle, the narrative's pieces fall into place to expose a profound betrayal. It is drama at its most compelling heights."
5,Ricki Tarr edit info,"To me this is the best thing ever put on TV that I have ever seen. A few years back I watched all of them in a row on a PBS fundraiser and was hooked. I bought a PAL version overseas and watch it once a year or so. Anyway, the US version has several small edits (ie Peter discussing ""tough guy"" training in the elevator) and one large edit, the second interrogation with Ricki Tarr. Smiley interrogates him regarding his use of passports and it is completely cut from the this DVD. Very disappointing and I still dont see why these edits were needed on a 3 dvd set. Still worth buying if youve never seen it."
3,space food sticks,"well i thought i was going to get more that one for the price so won""t buy them anymore. sorry i couldnt have gotten more for the price."
4,great modern thrash,Hopefully this guys keep up the crunchy thrash tunes as I dig it. Songwriting is better than on previous cds. Their EP is great too. They can get a 5 in my book if they take the songwriting to the next level - get more memorable lyrics/choruses stuck in my head.
5,The Perfect Overnight Bag,This bag is a terrific value! The bag firmly holds hangers in place. I've had this bag for several months and am extremely pleased with the purchase. Highly recommend!
3,"Before using, allow time for it to air out.","The garment bag arrived very promptly,and was as described.It is handy for an overnight stay, but not roomy enough for much more. I would prefer buckles on the sides make it more compact for carrying.My main complaint was the strong odor of synthetic materials that filled my closet where I had it stored before my trip. I had to air ir out for several days."
5,"Extremely thorough...from playing to care, performance, and recording!","Getting a book like this, I'm used to getting a primer in guitar theory. Not only do we get that (separated into three levels: Rhythm, Melodic, and Harmonic) in lessons that don't discriminate by genre, but also a full guitar maintenance guide, and helpful information concerning recording and performing live. Most of the book is very rock-centric, and I would have liked a little more attention focused on classical style just for variation. But I'm a rock fan anyway, so it worked perfectly.The main reason I bought it is because the advanced guitar classes at Loyola New Orleans (my alma mater) used it as a textbook. I can see why!"
5,Advanced or novice... This is the book for Guitarists!!,"Not a great big bunch to say! Everything a guitar person wants to know from style, to fundamentals, to luthier projects! Even history! Great reference for advanced musicians and great guide/textbook for newcomers!"
5,Mini-Encyclopedia of the Guitar,"The book is extensive, though not exhaustive, in its coverage of the history and description of the guitar, important and influential guitarists, teaching of basic chords, theory, etc. The photos are excellent, as are the cutaway illustrations of various guitar types. Understandably (after all, Andy Summers is co-author), there seems to be more emphasis on electric guitars, their accessories and proponents; but those of us who prefer the acoustic path should not feel left out at all--there's plenty for everyone! A great book to browse or to keep on one's coffee table."
5,Guitars Explained.,"This book successfully attempts to cover the broad spectra of guitars and guitar playing. Carefully divided and technically written, it provides detailed explainations of just about anything you may have to ask at the beginning to intermediate level of guitar proficiancy and explains the advanced.Coming in with some music theory background, I found the theory section a little broad but informative none the less. The book really shines towards the back where the authors begin to explain several mysteries (like the difference between a compressor and a limiter down to the level of showing you waveform graphs) that would stump even experienced players.It doesn't matter if you're just beginning guitar instruction or been playing for 10 years...this book is the one to have."
5,Absolutely The Best Guitar Book,"Having recently purchased a Stratocaster with Marshall amp after years of not playing, I needed a refresher on my chosen instrument. What a wealth of information I found in this fabulously illustrated and organized book.Once I picked this book up I couldn't put it down. It covers about everything you wanted to know that is related to guitar playing. The author gives you a concise bio of 20 different legendary guitar players, a complete background of guitar manufacturing and specs, guitar playing, maintenance and repair, soundstage and recording. You can jump around to whatever chapter interests you and read it in any order you desire. Every single page is filled with information and no paper is wasted in this book.I challenge anyone to show me a guitar book that does a better job. I've looked at a lot of them and this one is in a class by itself."
4,From Turkey with love!,"Dear people of the WORLD,I am making this announcement from Istanbul /TURKEY. I am 63 years old. My second child is a 24 years old boy. He is playing since 5-6 years a bass guitar. They have a music group and preparing an English music album in Progressive Metal Music. I have a friend who is also playing bass guitar since 25 years. I asked him if it possible to find any book about guitars. He answered without thinking: ""You should have The Guitar Handbook"".Then I searced in internet and found this great book in ""Amazon World"".Now my boy is very happy and I am also very happy as his father because of his happiness.Thank you very much Dear Amazon!!!Best regards to everybody who has read this announcement...Erdal Turkererdal_turker@yahoo.com"
1,Greatest Guitar Book Ever Made,"I gave this book a 1...Only so you actually see this review and ignore the other reviews that gave it a 1, 2, 3 or 4. Out of 5 this book is a 10.I checked this book out of my middle school library in 1998I kept it months past due.This book taught me guitar, taught me everything about the guitar, the technology - the culture.Since I've read this book I have gone on to meet probably every living gutiarist mentioned in this book- have played with many Grammy Winning and Platinum artists and have this book to thank."
4,The Guitar Handbook,"Excellent book for the beginner and anyone who wants to learn more about music theory. There was some, what I thought to be, wasted pages on guitar styles and how electric guitars and amplifiers work. The instructional part of the book however, was very good. Plenty of scales, modes, and chords. I would suggest reading the instructionl parts several times and then getting with someone who really knows what they're doing to have them kind of explain the parts you can't understand; as some of this stuff was a little over my head."
2,Not worth it.,"A mish mash of guitar trivia. Tries to cover it all, falls short of covering anything in any detail. I suppose it beats Reader Digest, and if you love guitars and playing you might find it interesting, but preview first as it is over priced for what it is. It spot lights the authors guitar playing friends and ignores the rest."
2,Not bad,"This book has lots of cool pictures and tells a good historical perspective of guitars, but I lost all respect for whoever the author/editor is because they failed to include Jimmy Page in their ""Greatest Guitarists"" section. Overall, the book is awite, lots of info, but right now it's gathering dust underneath a fan in my room. I guess I'm just not one to read a book about guitar, I'm one to pick it up and bang out some ROCK! PEACETHE K/M 3:16"
3,If you like this one,"If you like this book, please check iPlayMusic products. They are great and easy to follow."
4,EXCELLENT BOOK!!!,"I received this book from the seller in a moderate amount of time. However the book is in excellent condition, and I have been using it to improve my Guitar playing. I like how the book progresses from history to theory to actual pictures showing where exactly to place fingers for the different cords.My instructor has been playing for 30 plus years and he is impressed with all subjects in the book!This book is an asset to have whether you are learning and or playing any guitar, be it an acoustic and or electric. Whatever level of player you are, this book will definitely make you a better player, if you are just starting out as I am; it makes the learning process much, much easier to understand"
5,Great resource,I am a beginning guitar player and find that this book has something for all levels of capability. It has a broad range information and I recommend it for all players.
5,The Best Guitar Book Ever Written,Very broad in scope and well presented and written. A wealth if information for maintaining your own guitar and equipment and so much more. If you ever buy one book on guitars let this one be the one. For Real.
5,I'll bet every one of today's top guitarists has this.,"Well, you heard me. Everything has been explained, I'm just here to lend it more praise. This is a great book for any guitarist, either amateur or beginner. All I can say is that if you're learning to play, get this book. It will make many things seem so much easier."
5,Great resource,I ordered this book for my son's guitar lessions. He is doing great in his lessons and he enjoys the book.
5,comprehensive guide,This book is a comprehensive guide to both the guitar and the music theory that will help a guitarist increase range and versatility. I give this book to novices and virtuosos alike.
5,This is the best book I have read in YEARS,I caught me on page one. This is THE best book I have read in years. I can go as far to say I loved it more then one of Anne Rice's novels. I highly highly recommend this book.IT IS AWSOME!!!!!!
3,quick read but not a lot of substance,this is a fairly entertaining book for those who like to read religious supernatural fiction. it was a bit sophmoric in character development in my humble opinion. as it is a rather short book the story had a pretty happy ending. the heroine'sbackground was not entirely explained in great detail and it would have lent more body to this novel. the characters have hope for future experiences if developed more fully.
5,Loved it!,I purchased this CD for my daughters 5th Birthday Tea Party. The music set the stage for a perfect tea party where tea partiers and parents alike could enjoy themselves. I will continue to get great use out of the CD beyond the party!
2,Just buy Cure For Pain,"For anyone who is a newcomer to Morphine, Cure For Pain is their finest effort and a more proper introduction to the band than this hacked up greatest hits album. Corporate issued greatest hits always require a couple ""bonus tracks"" to scam the true fans that already own the entire artist's library, and Morphine is no different. For those of us who already invested hundreds of dollars in Morphine recordings, b-sides, and live recordings, as wells as seeing them in concert, it puts us in bit of a moral conundrum. (...) This Morphine fan doesn't think so, and will find an alternative means to hear these songs."
3,could be much better,"i love morphine, but not all of their stuff so i made a 'greatest hits' of my own and, without trying to sound too egotistical, its way, way better than this one. everyone reacts to morphine a bit differently, so i recomend you doing the same thing, just go through the samples and pick out the songs you like the most then download them and put it on your own CD, it will be much better than this half-effort."
1,all titles selected by me and paid for by me have not arrived..,"I am very unhappy with the service of Amazon, after paying for my DVD's over one month ago they have still not arrived...."
1,Worst ending I've ever experienced!,"I've read a lot of Graham Masterton in the past and was excited about ""Unspeakable"". This book had a great premise and a villain that surprised me (and I've read LOTS of mystery/suspense novels). Then came the ending. I'm actually throwing this book away, my conscience won't let me inflict the terrible ending on anyone else. Don't waste your money."
2,Feels like a first draft,"I don't want to write a particularly long review because, frankly, it doesn't feel like Masterton spent a lot of time writing this book. It's about a deaf social worker named Holly who also does some work for the police reading lips, a talent for which she is particularly gifted. Her child welfare investigations lead to some tense situations, one of which leads her to believe that she may have been cursed and is being followed by a supernatural creature, Raven.The novel is an especially easy read, with incredibly short chapters. But it feels like a first draft, as if it needed to be revisited, perhaps rewritten, to really flesh out the plot.And the ending, frankly, is stupid.I read a lot of Masterton novels, and I know how much I didn't care for this one because I would not recommend it to anyone, and I would never want it to be the first Masterton novel anyone read. Had it been my first, I believe it would have been my last."
3,good but on the weak side,"I actually liked this book, but for Graham i thought it was a little weak. its a good book to buy and read it just was more on a suspense then a horror novel which is what i was expecting but if you want suspence this is deffinetly the way to go."
2,Title Is Misleading,"There are at leat two definite impact structures on the Colorado Plateau: The Meteor Crater (Barringer Crater) in Arizona, and Upheaval Dome in Utah's Canyonlands National Park. I expected a somewhat detailed treatment of these features, and didn't get it.I also expected some discusssion of impact features in arid areas in general. I didn't get that, either.What I did get, and didn't want, was a thin, generalized history of the Colorado Plateau in terms of stratigraphic horizons, something any general textbook on the region would have provided. I feel the title of the work was highly deceptive, and I am sorry I bought what amounted to a duplicative text.There are far better, more specific text on the Colorado plateau. Buy one of those, and leave this one on the shelf, or in Amazon's stocks. Not recommended."
4,Wonderful Computer,"This Computer is great,This Computer is cool,This Computer is Wonderful,You can play the sims,You can Tycoon,You can even spell with baboon,It is so fun to have a Computer of your own,you can play and sing as you bring it home."
2,Worked well... while it worked.,"This product worked extremely well -- that is, while it was working. After 3 months it stopped turning on when you pressed the button.That being said, it did a wonderful job cleaning channel set baguette and round stones. It really removed the grime between and left the wedding band and engagement rings sparkling like new. My husband also used to clean his glasses in it, and it also worked well on my water resistant stainless watch with diamond accents. The capacity on this cleaner is a plus.I was truly disappointed that the machine ceased working, but this time around will probably try another product with a higher average rating than this one."
4,Not bad for home usage,It works fine. But you should not depend on the pure water to deep clean your dirty glasses. Adding a little dish cleaner will give you a good result
2,Didn't last long,"I bought this item a few years ago and then it just stopped working. First it wouldn't shut off, then it stopped all together. I would not recommend this item."
3,Jewelry Cleaner,"I like this jewelry cleaner very much, although nothing in the description said you must use a jewelry cleaning fluid. In fact, it said it could be used with nothing but water. The directions that came with it did not mention that, and supplied a bottle of cleaner. I am rather disappointed about that.Mireille McKell"
4,Effective Cleaner,I've been using this machine once a month to clean my wedding rings and three years later they still look new. Does a great job of removing the buildup behind the diamond setting where a toothbrush just doesn't quite reach. I also like the fact you can use plain water.
1,Buy something else.,"Quit working 2nd time turned on. Not only would not turn on, but rattled inside when shaken. BUY ANOTHER BRAND. Plus they charge for shipping when returning for warranty repairs."
1,Worked for 1 day,"I purchased the Haier HU335W Ultrasonic Cleaner and it stopped working after the first day. Until then, I was happy with the results, as I cleaned almost all of my jewelry. I followed the instructions to the letter, including unplugging the unit after each use and changing the water each time. Then, it just stopped working. I took it back and now I'm searching for another ultrasonic cleaner with better reviews."
2,You'll Take Your Chances,"This is an inexpensive, good looking, and efficient enough cleaner, but may have very limited life due to faulty components. I've purchased three of these, and know now it was a poor investment. The first stopped working after 5 months, and thinking it just bad luck, bought two more; one, I gave as a gift and reportedly is still working, but the second stopped working for me after almost a year of regular use. It works well, but you'll take your chances with this unit."
1,fell apart,"First the cover to the on/off buttons fell off. I didn't mind because it still worked (left button = on, right = off). Then the bottom came loose from the rest of it. It still worked, so I still didn't mind. I just held it carefully from the bottom. Finally, the bottom fell all the way off, wires appeared (one of them was severed), and an important looking piece broke off and sprang forth from its innards. Now it's in the trash. .P.S. These things happened during normal and non-traumatic use. All I have done is press buttons on it and take it back and forth from the cabinet.Edited 10/20/06I bought another one of these hoping I'd just had a lemon. Nope. Second unit is in the trash. This time the plastic covering of the screws popped off so I had to hold the top in place while opening and closing it. Then it stopped working altogether."
2,Pathetic Cleaning Power before it Died Altogether,"I'm wearing plastic InvisAlign ""aligners"" on my teeth (adult orthodontics) and was using this (so called) ultrasonic ""cleaner"" on them. First off, it has a timer that keeps the ""cleaner"" on for about three minutes. I quickly learned that three minutes was never getting the job done. So I developed a routine of hitting the button every time I passed for about a half hour each evening. Even this wasn't doing a complete job and I ended up scrubbing them with a toothbrush every few days. Thankfully this ""cleaner"" just stopped working one day (bought is in March -- died in October -- 7 month lifespan). Now I'll try getting one that actually does its job."
2,Nicely made but...,"I purchased the HU335W Ultrasonic Cleaner to use with my hobbies and expected it to make small part cleaning easier. The primary use was to be cleaning knobs and other parts from antique radio equipment. After several cleaning cycles, I still had to clean the knobs manually with a toothbrush. I also tried to use it to clean my razor with similar results. I tried to clean coins with no noticable results. The ""buzzing"" sound it makes when running makes me think it is not really running at ultrasonic speeds. It seems to be well made and is an attractive design that is reasonably priced. It did a reasonable job of cleaning my toothbrush. I would reccommend buying a more expensive unit and leaving this one on the shelf."
3,"Great for diamonds, but,...","Wonderful for engagement rings and wedding bands, but, not great at cleaning metals or other jewelery."
1,Not Haier brand!,"I bought this item from Jeweler's Supermarket because I wanted to get the Haier HU335W. What arrived was an Optima 3501. I never would have purchased from Jeweler's Supermarket had I known that they would not send me the item as described. I do own a Haier HU335W and really like it, but did not want to give an item as a gift that I had not ever tried before!"
4,Wife is pleased with product,....and that's what is important. She has quite a lot of jewelry (not too $$) and she is happy with this.
3,"Works, but takes more than once","This cleaner does what it should, but don't expect miracles. Jewelry won't come out like new, but it will be clean. It always takes more than 1 three minute cycle. But after a few (for mild dirt) to many cycles (for very dirty), your jewelry should be clean. I have only had it for about a month, but I've heard that you might need to seal it or it will leak and damage the wiring, but found that it has a rubber seal already."
4,I have one my mom got at a garage sale and it works great,We use it for our jewelry and glasses. I like it quite a lot since I don't have to worry about chemicals. Gets everything very clean and shiny.
1,Poor custom servie when it is broken,"Originally, I was happy with the product. However, it does not work anymore after a few uses, and it has passed the 90 day warranty time. I contacted the customer service line in their user manual. I am very disappointed at their poor customer service. The lady refused to give me any information where to fix it. Don't buy this product unless you are ready to throw it away and buy a new one if it is broken and passed the warranty time."
1,Don't bother,"I purchased this item on 4/25 received it on 4/48.. it worked fine then suddenly decided to stop working on 10/2. Tried to contact the company and the response I got was sorry it is over 90 days old... we can't help you...I realize this is not one of the most expensive ultrasonic cleaners made, but I only use is about once a week.. I would expect it to work for more than 5 months."
2,Expected Better,It's not a bad item but doesn't really work like described. Several cycles are needed in order to clean an item and some additional brushing might be required. It's just OK.
1,The power button stops working (had two of these),"It does an OK job of cleaning, but the power button stops working after a while (used once a day for a few months).I bought another because they were cheap (on sale at harbor freight). The 2nd one just died even faster than the first.It's just the power button. The mechanics are fine."
3,Ultrasonic Cleaner,"Works OK, not great. But in all fairness, it's a fairly low cost unit. If you want really great cleaning better spend more."
3,Ultrasonic Cleaner,"Good tool to use for regular cleaning maintenance. Certain things like copper jewelry or eye glasses will still need extra cleaning so if you're looking for something that does a real thorough job this may not be the item for you. Otherwise the sky is the limit. I dont regret buying the item, but I knew not to have high expectations for the price I paid by comparison to other cleaners."
5,Helps kids understand the conflict,"This was a great book. It's hard to believe it is a kids book because you don't get many books for kids on this subject. I think it's great that kids can learn about the Arab-Israeli dispute in a mellow way. I really liked this because you start to understand what it must feel like to be 9 in Israel right now. I think the reason the Israelis and Arabs got over their fight (in the book) is because they relized they could share, and they could use it for something they had in common. And, in the end it all worked out, for everyone."
4,A Good CD,"Is it their best CD? No...not by far, but then again, their first CD set the bar pretty high, but if you are a fan of Giant, you'll find a few songs on this album that you'll enjoy."
5,Why O Why O Why O Did I Ever Leave Ohio?,"Well, gee, with music by Leonard Bernstein and lyrics by Comden and Green, and Roz Russell croaking out her tunes how could this be anything be great? The booklet that comes with the CD has with some nice liner notes about the production and swell photos.Not for the uniniated, but a must have for the collector!"
5,Danzig III: How the Gods Kill,"Awesome CD. If you like Danzig. Not a good CD if you are just getting started listening to Danzig though. Listen to Danzig I or II:Lucifuge before thinking about any of his later stuff. If you like Misits, you may not like this, be warned. This music is more metal than misfits, and has a classic rock sound to it. But the cd itself is amazing. Stand out songs are bodies, and sistinas."
5,One Helpful Guide For Cruising The Inside Passage,"This book is great for those who want to cruise to Alaska in a small boat or just enjoy cruising around islands in the Inside Passage. It is full of tips, lists, and local insight from someone that has made the trip several times. I was glad to know small boats can make the trip to Alaska if you are careful. Besides this book I suggest anyone planning to make a trip like this take the piloting classes offered by the United States Power Squadron or Coast Guard Auxiliary to learn more about using charts, and GPS."
1,"Surprise, Surprise","I am disappointed that the editorial review did not indicate that this book is actually an evangelical platform for a born-again Christian. Mr. Petersen averages some discourse on his God and his faith about every 5 pages. There are 38 ""God"" citations in the index.Had I known that the voyage was to serve as his ""Sermon on the Inside Passage"", I would not have purchased the book."
3,A bumpy ride,"This one defies easy categorization. A disconcerting mixture of satire, melodrama, fantasy and farce. Unlike several of the reviewers, I felt that the account of Charles lolling about his ancestral home was forced and stagey. The dialog spoken by the pantomime characters is predictable and empty. Charles's take on the Irish economic boom, the so-called Celtic Tiger, however, is accurate, deft and very funny. His completely underwhelmed response to Ireland's ballyhooed economic miracle is worth the many speed-ups, slow-downs and improbablities that drive the over-heated plot."
5,An Evening (or two) of Laughs!,"This is one of the funniest novels I've ever read. On the cover of a lot of books it's stated that a novel is funny, but few ever live up to the hype. Sure, many are told in an amusing tone, but very few make you laugh aloud on a consistent basis. But Mr. Murray, with his wry Irish wit, delivers on page after page. The characters are well fleshed and vulnerable, the plot is straight ahead and convincing, and the humor comes from all angles. If you love British/Irish humor, or even if you don't, this is a novel not to be ignored."
2,Not true to itself,"The writing is graceful, light, and compelling. I couldn't wait to turn the pages to learn more of Charles, his family, and today's Ireland examined and revealed through tender humor. However, the book is more than just humor, and this is where it fails. When the book is written as humor, it is most successful. Unfortunately, the author, Murray, shifts from humor to a type of melodrama toward the end that doesn't work as well. Short-listed for the Whitbread Award? Fine and good. The beginning deserves the recognition of such a respected award. However, the disappointment of the ending rates the book a 2."
2,"much too long, and not worth it","From the cover, I assumed this would be a light frothy romp through British upper class decadence, like something brittle and brilliant that Waugh or Wodehouse could type out quickly. Instead, it was about an Irish family facing hard economic times. The hero is an alcoholic slacker who is obsessed with actress Gene Tierney, who obviously represents his own mother and sister. There just aren't enough laughs in the early pages, and then the darker stuff takes over: exploited foreign workers, thieves living in squalor, a mailman who steams open everyone's letters, poverty, the heartlessness of international megacorporations.I reached a point where I just didn't care for these characters. I wanted something impressive to happen. I didn't believe a couple of the final plot twists. I kept counting pages; 424 was just too much for me. I read the entire thing, but I wish that I hadn't."
3,No Skippy,"There is no doubt that this suffers in comparison to Skippy Dies, a book that is on my list of all-time favorites. The only things the two books have in common is that they are overlong and a little repetitive. But with Skippy, there is maybe too much of a good thing. Here, there's just too much.I mostly enjoyed An Evening, though. It's cute and clever. My real criticism lies with the melancholy ending, which I don't think the novel earns.I'm still a Paul Murray fan, though."
3,Borrow........Don't buy!!,"Jane Redmon, investigative reporter for the Washington Post, has a story of a lifetime, involving a scandal with a US senator. However, this investigation proves to be deadly for those that know too much. The senator does everything in his power to keep his 'affairs' private, even kidnapping Jane and threatening her life. Her father, Tom Redmon, has more than a passing interest with the senator, something that Jane knows nothing about. He sets out on a '48 hour' adventure to save his daughter before it's too late.This was my first book by Tim Green, and I must say that I was somewhat disappointed. The plot/storyline was all too predictable and most of the action was completely unrealistic. However, this will not be my last book by the author, as the book did keep me in suspense and I did finish it.Trish"
2,Tremendously Average,"This is my first Tim Green book and I'd have to say that I was not very impressed. The premise of the book intrigued me so I sprung for the $25. Being a fan of Patterson, Grisham, Baldacci, et all, the story here was very light in development and detail. As a father looks for his kidnapped daughter, the first 48 hours of her disappearance are counted down. The premise here is that when someone is missing for over 48 hours that it isn't very likely that they'll be found. After a very short while I found the constant referrals to how much time was left on the clock extremely annoying. In all I figure that 2 of the 48 hours were wasted just talking about how much time was left. I felt the countdown didn't really add any suspense at all in fact. On the good side, the book is a fairly quick read so the pain is somewhat short lived."
2,This book wasn't for me.,"I had heard a few good things about Tim Greens books, from a few of my friends, and my girlfriend. So I got a copy of this book.The story was well written, but unrealistic. I realised this by the time in the book, you have Jane Redmon driving in Manhattan in her convertible, while on an assignment. I haven't heard of to many reporters that do that in Manhattan. Not that they can't, just that it would be very inconvienant. That is just one example.Otherwise, like I said it was very well written. If you aren't looking for realism, just a fun book to read, then this might be for you. Its just not a book for me."
1,Save your time & money,"The premise was good... the first 48 hours in a kidnapping being the most important to recovering the victim alive. Good man/father brought down by his own mistakes, but willing to do whatever it takes to recover his adult daughter alive. The hint of political intrigue with a corrupt senator (somehow linked to the father's past). Unfortunately, this evolved into a totally unbelievable saga with far too much violence and too many lose ends (like the repercussions of the missing senator). There are too many good books out there; don't waste your time or money on this one."
2,Disappointing,This was a very disappointing book. It was all I could do to stay with it. Character & story development were poor & plot uninteresting. I had read & enjoyed Fifth Angel so thought this would be better. I was mistaken.
2,Disappointing,"The story is improbable and full of holes and inconsistencies. I'm usually good at suspending disbelief but this novel went too far for me. The worst part was the ending. Tim Green wrote himself into a corner. I was interested in seeing how he was going to write himself out of it. Instead, he ignored the difficult parts and gave no explanation. The other ridiculous part was the arbitrary 48 hour deadline. I understand the statistical importance of the first 48 hours but this character acted as though his daughter would be vaporized as soon as 48 hours were up even though he approximated the start of the countdown.There are so many good writers out there (Nelson Demille, Greg Iles, Brian Haig, Harlan Coben, etc.). I can't imagine the ones I've read having an aberration this disappointing, so I doubt that I'll be giving Tim Green a second chance."
2,far-fetched entertainment,"This book is a real composite of Tim Green's fiction. It has the fast pace and pretty far-fetched plot of several of his NFL-based thrillers (such as Outlaws), but it also has some of the originality and hook of his more recent legal thrillers (such as The Letter of the Law and The Fifth Angel). The First 48 is not as good as his legal thrillers; it really signals more of a return to the action/suspense stories Green spun in some of his later NFL novels. The style in this book is very short chapters that are episodic, though Green ties them together nicely, that don't really give you much character development. Green starts off strong, as he usually does, but then gets a little carried away with the plot. A couple parts had me saying with a laugh ""Oh, come on!"" But it's entertaining, and the conclusion is fitting though short. The First 48 is not Green's best effort, but it's still fun."
3,Just Didn't Like It,"I have been trying to think about what makes me dislike the book. I feel the book is just thin. It has lots of action, but the characters are not well-developed. A great deal of the action within the story defies belief. This is the first time I read a Tom Green novel. I don't think I will pick up another. It is light reading with plenty of action and a simple plot."
3,WEARIN DOWN OF THE GREEN,"Former footballer Tim Green has a raw talent evidenced in some of his action stagings, and his no-nonsense kind of heroes. In this one, it's Tom, an ""over the hill"" former lawyer taken down by an ambitious politician named Michael Gleason. Tom hooks up with his ex-biker/computer genius buddy Mike Tubbs, and sets out to find out where his newspaper reported daughter has disappeared to. You see, she's working on exposing Michael Gleason for the dirtbag he is. Daughter Jane is also falling in love with a mysterious informant, Mark Allen, who is probably more than he appears to be as well.Green's plotting borders on absurdity here as the heroes kidnap and torture Senator Gleason. The probability of this is so ludicrous, one can't help but snicker when sniveling Gleason reacts to the abominable torture scenes.The novel moves well, and aside from its incredible plotting, is an enjoyable read."
3,"Came on time, condition is acceptable","On the up side, the textbook was sent promptly and received within one week. However, although the book has no visible wear on the outside cover, the inside pages are filled with writings from the previous owner. Every couple of pages, I find paragraphs written over with highlighter and pencil scribbles. Fortunately I can erase most of it, but it would have been nice if the seller or previous owner had taken the time to clean it up prior to selling."
1,Trash,"If you want to have a solid understanding of numerical computation, this book is definitely the last choice. Many theorems are given without any proof or even intuitions behind them in this book. Even when a proof is provided, it's often far from rigorous. The organization of chapters is the worst I have ever seen, revelant materials are scattered over several different locations rather than put together. Take the SVD for example, it is mentioned in the end of chapter 3, but reappears in chapter 4, which is very confusing. If you are new to this area, please don't read this book. It gives you many many facts without explanations, which I think is not a good way to learn new things. David S. Watkins' Fundamentals of Matrix Computations is a lot better and easier to understand. It also emcompasses many detailed treatments of various theorems. If you have bought Heath's book, don't be sad, at least it can serve as a coaster."
3,Not the best textbook,"As some other reviews have pointed out, this book is not the best at giving examples. It gives examples of the concepts, but they are not well explained and skip a lot of steps. If one is familiar with the concepts, then they are great, because they skip right to the point, but it is definitely not the greatest if you are trying to learn the basics of the concepts.What is really good about this book, is that at the end of each chapter, it has a list of the built-in library functions that do the algorithms the chapters talk about, in a bunch of different languages (Matlab, maple, etc). Another good thing is that it gives a basic outline of many of the algorithms."
2,Go with the real stuff,"I highly recommend going with the name brand duct-tape, this is a generic; even if it IS made by 3m. The strength is nowhere near that of duct-tape and its ability to stick to stuff while cold is very poor. This stuff hardly has any threads going through it to improve strength. ALSO, this stuff is NOT light-proof, it will shine right through!"
1,Delusional,It's very sad this woman thinks she can change people's genetic predisposition instead of accepting diversity. It's ironic she alludes to animals in her book titles since biologists have found homosexual behavior exists in every level of mammal society. My heartfelt sympathy to her son.
1,Misguided,I feel sorry for the poor author of this book. She has been misguided so she does not really understand Jesus Christ or his healing power. So she writes a book that will continue to lead people away from the Truth.
5,a must-read for anyone wanting to overcome homosexual thoughts and feelings,"This is one amazing book. It is the actual journal of a mother whose son was caught up in internet porn and homosexuality. The great thing is it tells how he was able to permanently overcome both problems and change his life completely.Whereas many say that homosexuality is an inherent part of a person's makeup, this story tells the truth that with proper supportive counseling and tapping into God's love, unwanted feelings and addictions can be sent on their way."
4,A Good Resource for LDS Surfing,"This is a fairly complete book, telling you where to find LDS sites. Of course it has no sites against the LDS faith. How many books on mainstream Christianity refer you to atheist resources? The idea that they should have provided information that is anti-LDS is preposterous. It was simply not the purpose of the book. Give it a try if you're interested in finding those sites devoted to Latter-day saints out there, bearing in mind that new ones crop up every day. And if the book fails to satisfy your thirst for knowledge, I know a LOT more sites.."
1,This book is rather disturbing,"I came across a copy od ""mormons on the internet"" and read the book in a couple of hours. I then checked out the web sites andas a member of the minority religious persuasion in the Salt Lake City community and a jew.I found some of the reccommendations disturbing. I am sure amazon will delete this review because it seems that one cannot criticize books on religion.I will leave out all the disturbing passages i found and just say as a Jew and a person of color. i do not find this book enlightening, i find it opinionated and smug!"
2,Only one side of mormonism on the web,"This is a great resource if you only want half of the story. There was no mention of these heavily useful sites:www.exmormon.org www.xlds.org www.freedomfrommormonism.org That would have balanced the book for anyone wanting to know more than what the biased Mormon leaders want you to know, but it's out there on the internet and should have been included. I mean they have nothing to cover up right?"
5,The True Catholic in the Church of Christ,"This book is just filled with useful information which includes The Ceremonies of the Church, Acts of Adoration in the Home, The Holy Rosary, A Simple Method of Confession, Home Studies For Altar Boys, How to Assist the Sick and Dying, Golden Thoughts on the Principal Feasts, and the Principal Feasts and Fasts Explained. With chapters on The Happiness of Heaven, The Veneration and Invocation of the Saints, Our guardian Angels, The Veneration Due the Mother of God and the Use of Holy Images.It also includes selections from Writings and Sayings of the Saints, The Religious and Moral Traning of Children, The Duties of Children to Their Parents and Explanations of Important Facts in Church History."
4,How to be a MAN! or not.,"These are some terrific shorts and are very entertaining, looking back on them now. The Navy film about sailors knocking up their girlfriends. Being trustworthy. Your Body During Adolescence. These and more are great entertainment. Be prepared to watch and laugh."
3,cheap,You get what you pay for... The buttons may fail or start sticking after some moderate use. And spending more money to ship the product back to manufacturer for warranty work seems futile.
2,This really sucked for me...,"At first this controller worked, and then it started to become a pain. It thinks I'm always pressing down on the joystick, so it makes it impossible to play any games with out lots of downard movement. So it's impossibe to pick teams for MVP basebll. This is what it was like for me at least."
1,Just plain wrong,I bought 2 of these but the upc number does not match the product. The company that I bought them from Beach Audio claims it's Amazon's fault that the wrong picture is associated with the upc number. I say it's Beache's fault for not making sure the right picture is with the merchandise that they are selling thru Amazon. What do you think world is it Amazon's fault or is it Beach Audio's fault?
3,Great strictly for GameCube games,"Now, for someone with an actualGameCube System, this 3rd party brand MadCatz makes a great controller buy if you own aWiilike me, you may have problems. On the Wii, The contoller works great for Actual GameCube games, for Some Virtual Console games and Wii Games that are compatable with a A GameCube Contoller like the recently releasedMario Kart Wii, The MadCatz Brand should be avoided at all costs. Not all of the controls works with Wii Games compatable with A GameCube controller. For GameCube system owners, This is a great controller. For Wii Owners like me, You are better off using aGameCube Controllerofficially made by Nintendo."
3,I like this one .......but it was a little silly.,"Fearless Hyena starts out well then vollies up and down as far as fight scenes go.None of the scenes were bad but they are really silly at times and even alittle stupid.All and all I like this one and recommend it to anyone.The evil character is Hawg Jang Lee and he clearly is the better in the last fight scene.I just call him ""Supreme""."
4,good old school kung fu,"Except for the cheezy sound effects and music I think this is a very good kung fu flick.This stars a young Jackie Chan who has to learn a special technigque to defeat the killer of his uncle.This movie has great fight scenes,as one would expect for a Jackie Chan movie.The voice overs get a little bad at some points unfortunently but the comedy that Jackie Chan provides more than makes up for it."
2,Really embarassing!,"I'm sorry, but I really didn't like this movie. I thought Drunken Master, Half a Loaf of Kung Fu and Snake in Eagle's Shadow were all far superior. The comedy in this is so low it makes the Three Stooges look like sophisticated intellectuals. I just cringed through the ridiculous cross-eyed beggar scenes, and Jackie in drag. I actually thought Fearless Hyena 2 was better (or maybe I should say it was less bad), even though I know Lo Wei made it without Chan's input or approval, and using a look-alike in some scenes."
5,chantastic,this is by far the best of his early work this is chantastis has some of his best fights ever
1,Not on par with original Tchoupi,"This is a lousy movie, and it is a shame. The Tchoupi series are all very innocent and sweet and revolve around small daily events like a new kitten, planting a garden, etc. This movie has a cheap storyline involving a menacing black shadow with yellow slit eyes who steals special toys. It is genuinely frightening. Tchoupi does unrealistic things like drive all over town in his toy car with his friends. Pilou's robot can fly and attack people. There is an awkward dream sequence that looks like Mario Brothers where Tchoupi shoots and is shot and attacked by the scary menace. It's just really bad, and it is too bad. Shame on the producers! (If you buy this, note it is Zone 1/North America, even though it is all in French.)"
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...],"Weird, confusing, and pointless. I really don't understand what all the hype is about. Yes, Ellen Burstyn performance was unbelievable, but the movie was just terrible. Honestly, I know it has a huge cult following, but wtf is so special about it? Please someone fill me in...What am I missing?"
2,Sealed on 2 sides,"I should have read the description more carefully - I had never heard of folders that were sealed on two sides. The usual left side is sealed, but also the bottom is also sealed, making the folder kind of awkward if you want to open it up. On the upside, you can tear at the bottom CAREFULLY and make it an openable folder. However, the folder is quite flimsy - not what I expected."
4,Healthier snack,My kids really like these snack. I love that they can still have a fun snack without all the preservatives and sugar.
4,GOod stuff,"Yeh i jsut use this on my Compaq Ipaq and its great, does all i want it to do... so thumbs up for PDA use"
4,Pretty Freaking Awesome - But With Minimal Flaws,"Imagine Necrophagist having a love child with At The Gates. It would definitely sound like With Passion. This band is talented and definitely excel at what they do. They actually use very minimal (if none) breakdowns and focus more on guitar skills. Sometimes, it can be out-of-hand wankery, but if you appreciate technical music, you'll appreciate this. This CD is almost perfect, but it could use a slight bit more focus. Also, it has 2 interludes and 6 real tracks. Otherwise, give ""In The Midst of Bloodied Soil"" a listen if you enjoy Necrophagist, Gorod, At The Gates, and Between The Buried and Me."
4,Bah,"Who were those boorish engineers whose overhead camera shots showed what was below the blue plastics that was supposed to be the lake below the throne room. We ended up watching the rest of the props which an audience was not supposed to see. I can understand showing behind the scene sets during intermission, but not during a performance."
3,Disappointing,"Whatever your opinion is about the grand Zeffirelli production at the theater, it doesn't work for the small screen, even when the BluRay technology brings you every single detail. The great spectacle that this production is supposed to be looks crowded and confusing on TV. First act is on the darker side, making it even less appealing on TV. Many think Zeffirelli's production is already passé. It was never intended to be shown on TV and it doesn't seem to work. The WOW factor is not there.The start of the night is Liu (Marina Poplavskaya). Her singing and acting is superb. Puccini would have been proud of her heroine. Calaf (Marcello Giordani) is disappointing and gets loss when confronting Turandot (Maria Guleghina). For some reason I don't found any passion in his signing and certainly not in his acting.If you are looking for a great spectacle, watch Zubin Mehta conduct in the forbidden city of Beijing (1998). Although the audio is Stereo only, it is worth watching and listening."
1,keep shopping,"I had high hopes for this, but am very disappointed. Zipper is on the bottom if you are holding the bag by the strap. The stap on mine is sewn in such a way that the strap is twisted. Appears to have been made without anyone checking to see if it was made right."
4,Not as picture shown! But nice product nonetheless.,"This is a well made product which comfortably holds both my tripod & monopod. The only negative is that the material showed a small snag (catch) early on which I was rather surprised by given that it generally seems strong, and I would prefer the zip to be on the same side as the handle. The way it's designed means the zip always ends up on the ground, thus attracting grass & mud to the teeth. But overall I think it warrants it's four stars."
4,Nice case,"Simple product. Large enough to hold my slik tripod, monopod, and I can even fit in a gorrila pod. Mostly a good case to transport things. Good for the price, better if it had some padding. The picture shows it closing with a drawstring, mine closes with a zipper which is much nicer."
3,OK but not as good as Ursula Andress version,"While this is definitely a classic, I can understand why it was so unsuccessful when released. Key roles, especially ""She-who-must-be-obeyed"" are horribly miscast. Ms. Gahagan simply is not convincing in the role of the eternal queen. This version also changes the original story and moves it to the Arctic??.The remake with Ursula Andress was much better in terms of casting and in staying faithful to the original story. The acting in this remake was also much better than the 1935 version in my humble opinion. Ursula Andress is perfect and stunning in the role of queen Ayesha, She-who-must-be-obeyed. Her performance is certainly more convincing than that of Ms. Gahagan.Check out the Ursula Andress version which is finally available in a Region 1 DVD version and see for yourself."
1,What Deleted Scene?,"An otherwise excellent transfer is marred bynot including the ""deleted scene"" (found inthe supplements)in its proper place withinthe film. The scene was never ""deleted""but was a cut at the time of a reissue so that""She"" could fit better on a double bill with""The Last Days of Pompeii."" This same cutversion was used by Kino in their release."
3,Some Problems,"It's irritating that if you want to hear the commentary you have to watch the tacky colorized version of the movie. The Cooper biographer provides insight, but I missed any reference to the curious inclusion in the film of several obvious mistakes, namely actors stumbling over their lines. The movie itself lacks the spirit and character of Kong, and we spend less time with She herself than we'd like. But, it's still an interesting curio with a fascinating performance from Gahagan."
3,Lost World Classic Found!,"""SHE"" is a perfect example of classic Hollywood adventure film. Merian C Cooper produced spectacular moments ( the avalanche) and some priceless camp (during the human sacrifice production number I expected Fred and Ginger to appear at any moment). The colorized version reminds me of those Maria Montez technicolored extravanzas which were clearly influence by this films rich if slightly wacky art direction which feature both Art Deco palaces and dancing cave men. ( Was this film suppose to be a musical?) One thing for sure- they don't make them like this anymore !"
4,A Classic,"For the time, a star-wars spectacular. I found myself Wowing and Hoo-Hah-ing at times. The effects in places are seamless and almost indistinguishable from reality. The acting is what you would expect for the period, the movie drags and is corny, but there is structure in four parts. It is quite philosophical in places, with some dramatic speeches and nuances. The incredibly innocent beauty of Helen Mack, former child star, at times just stops the action, although her abilities are quite sporadic. Nigel Bruce is so damn blustery, English, and irritating you want to see him killed and eaten, but then that is his constant character. There is waaaayyy too much ""ritual"" dancing and choreography, which NEVER works in film. But, for the time, its kinda snappy, if verging on Buzby Berkley at one point. You expect them to break into a tap chorus line, but thankfully they don't. But I think they thought about it. This movie deserves your attention. I recommend it."
3,Review of the other Reviews,"I just read the four posted reviews of this movie hoping to get some inkling of what it's about in order to decide if I should buy it or not. Unfortunately I find I know no more about the movie plot or theme after reading the posted reviews than I did before I read them. My review is directed to all who post reviews for all movies on Amazon. Write your review for people who haven't seen the movie and have little or no knowledge of it. Having read the posted reviews, I still don't know if this movie is about a chimpanzee in a hot air ballon, a murder mystry, a comedy or an what happens to an ice cream cone on a hot day. Somebody, anybody, what's the movie about?????"
5,A MASTERPIECE,"When I bought this film two weeks ago I was somewhat familiar with the title, felt I should check this ting out...I saw it with Mama and we both became spellbound with our mouths wide open.....Many a film has been been released under the banner ""You have never seen things like this"" - and this film is it.... It is firmly in my movielibrary - every scene(except the last) is hypnotic... IT+s the Ibsen and Shakespeare of the 30s adventure film(with King Kong of course)... Be sure to see this artdeco and - oh I can`t go on - in color.... THIS FILM MUST BE PRESERVED FOR POSTERITY:-))) NB: IT\s easy to see where Disney had his inspiration for the Wicked Queen in SnowWhite and the Seven Dwarfs...."
3,She (1935) is a great Saturday matinee movie,"Others can give readers the story line. Let me try to give you feel for the the film. It plays out more like a 1930's German Alpine Film than most RKO Studio films of the time. The story has some interesting twists that will remind the viewer Fritz Lang's The Spiders! In some ways it resembles Werewolf of London (1935)or the much better ""Lost Horizon"" (1937).I can not agree with the comparisions (or hype) to King Kong! (There is ""no"" simularity other than in a broad sense of adventure.) True most of the cast and crew also worked on other RKO Merian C. Cooper films.I would recommend this film as a second title of Rainy Saturday matinee ."
2,Be Careful,"Theres nothing wrong with this movie. Its typical 1930s escapist fun. The problem here is the transfer of the film itself. I've ordered the DVD twice, through two different vendors and both had the same problem. The bottom half of the picture flutters. This goes through about the first 10 minutes or so of the film and is extremely distracting. I can't say whether thats just how the copy of the print they used was (KINO is usually better than that) or if its just a batch of badly pressed DVDs. I guess I'll wait awhile and try ordering it again in a year or so. Too bad, as its really is a fun film."
4,Exotic fantasy done in exhuberent 30's style,"Strange, camp, and ornate. Most of the King Kong crew returns with some well-done special effects, great music, absurd dance numbers, and human sacrifice. Fascinating and very entertaining."
3,BEWARE: arbitrary deletions!,"Being a huge fan of the spectacular results this outfit gets, I was shocked and alarmed to discover that several scenes in this classic film were arbitrarily DELETED from the original director's print! They are included in the ""extras"", but still, this practice (they've done it before) is deplorable and disturbing. What can they be thinking?"
4,"If you are thinking of this, you will like it","My husband collects older horror movies, those that he has seen as a kid. So, if you are thinking about this one, you will probably like it. Delivery was fine."
1,Badly Designed,"Unlike the other stunt vehicles, the RC Jumping Tricycle Stunt Vehicle Car was not well thought out. It only has one wheel in the back which is a bit too light. This makes the vehicle spend too much time upside down, making very loud noises. And, if it's used on linoleum, tile, or hardwood, it will leave scuff marks like you will not believe. It's not worth the price even if it were free.Nancy Alexanian"
1,Defective,"This product never worked for me. It was defective. It was also poorly designed from what I could tell. To charge the battery, you have to remove it from the car, and charge. This means taking the cover plate off and detaching the battery cord. Detaching the battery cord was incredibly hard. A young child would have to get an adult every time the RC needed charged. If this product was free, it would still be a little too pricey for me.The seller (IGgFactory Inc.) has also not responded to my requests for a refund. Avoid them at all costs. They over charge on shipping as well."
3,of course,panty shots-bra shots- and what men are willing to do to get them. i found it entertaining though a bit madcap which was the point i guess. i think the shorts are more for guys to enjoy but it is funny. I would look at my guy and he'd just nod like it was all true.Good for a laugh
2,* * 1/2 stars,"overhwleming and underhwelming, at times funny at times dumb, and way to hyperactive and hallucengenic, the only way anybody can fully enjoy any of this is probablly inebriated in some way or form. while at times funny its far too perverted, as well as,histronic,loud,and spazy.the anime summed around the obsession of panty shots and what not and the men who sweat bullets over them....thats pretty much about it. for a show about nothing it basically serves to druggy visual remixing and hyperactive intermission cuts virtually impossiblet watch without getting headache unless your on some serious drugs. the anime is saved by the dialogue gags which actually are kind of amusing but the site gags are so over the top and unfunny its seem like typical anime humor except even more teeth grindingly unwatchable."
5,Real Stories from the Field,I read this book to learn more about international aid workers. It is a good book with exciting stories from intense life and death situations in the last 20 years. Read if you are considering a career in aid work
4,Great stories don't always have to end with success,This book is not only looks into the hoaxes by the psyche of the hoaxsters. Why would they do it? What were their motivations? What do they have in common. Equally interesting is the individual who actually accomplished his exploration but was accused of pulling a hoax. He had all the evidence to prove his claim but would not use it! Why? His psyche had common ground with hoaxsters. To find out more you will have to read the book. It is an interesting read.
3,US Army AK-47 TM,"This manual provides the bare basics for operating an AK-47. The photos are quite hard to interpret, and mostly useless. It's okay for those only interested in making their AK going bang and that's it. Nothing special or noteworthy here."
1,Cubicon Broke!,"After only a month of use the cubicon contoller has broken. The ""A"" button is stuck in the down position. After opening up the controller I found the rubber seat tore along the edges. Very [poorly made] product. I do not recommend it."
1,BUY A REAL CONTROLLER!,"Don't waste your money on the cheaper versions of any system's controllers. I have bought many (this cubicon being one of them), the second time I used this it just broke. The buttons don't work. It sucks, just spend the [money] on the real controller."
5,this conntroller is awsome!!!!!!!!!,just buy it. it has a button called macro so enybody coul lose the game you are winning (you block the conntroller)
1,not fit for my car,"i buy by amazon from florida and send me to CHile.This fit not for model of truck, is first time that this problem ocur for this model car.other seller send me correct fit for this model.not recomended.No recomiendo para compras fuera de USA, vendedor dice que es de un modelo de exportación, lo que claramente no es así ya que he comprado en múltiples ocasiones a otros vendedores enviándome la repuesto correcto.No se hacen cargo del traslado al extranjero.Por este motivo se perdió la compra al exterior por ser más caro el transporte que el produicto"
5,'Swiss Army Knife' of Upper Level Mathematics,"I totally agree with the previous two reviewers on what they had to say about this wonderful book. However, I did want to briefly note that -- beyond merely being a fascinating overview of the development of beyond-calculus mathematics -- it is also a great resource for people needing to look up or review topics in advanced mathematics (especially mathematical logic). Again, to repeat what the others have said, buy this book if you have ANY interest in mathematics. You won't regret it."
1,The author lacks basic knowledge about mathematical history,The author reviews mathematical history but mentions no India nor China. He presented a biased view of mathematical history.The books is misleading in that regard.
3,A neglected gem of a musical!,"All American opened in New York during a city-wide newspaper strike so no one heard about it and it didn't last long. It deserved better with its bright score, including some tunes that have entered the popular domain such as ""Once Upon A Time"". It has excellent dancing and a theme which is still timely: an imigrant professor on an American college campus learning what it means to be an American and falling in love with the dean of women. You'll hum and whistle its tunes once you get to know them."
4,Not sure but here goes,"Iam buying this cd out of curiousity. Heard Ray Bolger and Eileen Herlie singing ""Once Upon a Time"" on a compilation disc and thought this might be an interesting show. By the way, from the reviews that I read it appears that this is another lost gem from the early 60's. May I suggest to those who like listening to shows that should have had longer runs but didn't that they check on Mr. President and Little Me. Both are great and alas had short runs but Little Me did get two revivals."
5,a REAL Companion,"This is really a wonderful companion to the Daozang. Before going to the original texts in the Daozang, it is helpful and inspiring to read the entry in the work first."
1,A huge disappointment,This is NOT the Daozang (the Taoist Canon). This 3-volume set is almost entirely useless. It is a huge collection of descriptions of the entries of the Daozang. It does NOT reproduce the actual Daozang itself! Talking about words in lieu of the original words themselves? They spent 30 years doing this?? Why not just translate the original Daozang scrolls and print them? Whatever happened to being straightforward?
2,"Should Be Titled ""Step-By-Step""","As a computer professional I was disappointed with the book. Each chapter is basically a series of instructions for using the Site Server Commerce edition. There are practically no illustrations or screen shots related to the steps which makes it a little hard to follow, and certainly version specific. If you are looking for step by step instructions on how to get through the Site Server Commerce edition wizards then this book is for you. If you are looking for a book where you will actually learn Site Server Commerce edition you might want to try another book. I certainly didn't feel like I had Mastered Site Server Commerce edition after reading the book."
1,Appalling,"Without doubt the worst computer book I have ever purchased. After struggling with it for a week, I just threw it away. It doesn't even read like a book - it looks more like a set of half-baked student notes. The book is not big to begin with, and since half of it consists of non-commented code, the amount of solid material is miniscule. The rest consists of interminable step-by-steps stating the bleeding obvious (click Department to edit the Departments). The only worthwhile chapter is a detailed set of installation instructions under NT4 (none of which apply if you are using Windows 2000). Don't even bother if you are thinking about the exam. You'd do better by reading the on-line help."
2,stuck,This isn't a review. I would like to know how to acccess the sample site the book talks about. The URI doesn't work.
2,Risk II doesn't run under Windows XP,"We really used to enjoy this game when we had our old Windows 98 system, but since we upgraded to XP, we can't get Risk to run, even after reinstalling. It just doesn't work, which is a shame...."
4,A good pack of games for a rainy day,"The games are fun, but of course, not up to more recent graphical standards. A good set of strategy games for fans of classics."
3,Nothing is easy in Eastern Europe,"It is a pretty decent thriller with good actors, it is well shot, it has some fine moments.However, the plot is complicated way beyond any reasonable level: we have French security service, Polish security service, Polish police, corrupt French businessmen, a corrupt Polish businessman, gangster rivalry, small business problems in post-Communism environment, two family histories, Polish history, brain tumor, Bosnia and Hamas.A good thing is that it is still possible to figure out who is shooting whom and why, though, but it is not easy."
4,Very good show which I hadn't heard of...,"I was very into theatre in high school and college and thought I was up on most musicals, but had never heard of this show until recently. It's comprised of three short stories which were adapted into the musical format. The first two stories are tied together very well, although the last seems tacked on. But the songs are catchy and it's fairly easy to figure out what's happening simply by listening to the songs. There are two songs which are tied for my favoritism: ""It's a Fish"" from Adam and Eve and ""You Are Not Real"" from Passionella. Check it out."
1,Boring material that you forget very easily,"According to some reviews, this musical was supposed to be very good and I bought it. Unfortunately, I was quite dissapointed. It's composed of three different tales, the first one referring to the Adam & Eve biblical story. The lyrics here are very silly and tedious. The second tale, ""The Lady or the Tiger?"" contains songs that are simply awful, probably the worst ever written for a Broadway show. The third story, ""Passionella"", contains music that does nothing to make things better. The album contains a good informative booklet in English, German, French & Italian (as Sony uses to do)which says that Time magazine defined this show as ""three moldy figs"". I entirely agree. I would recommend this musical to those suffering from insomnia: it will put them to sleep right away."
5,Everything I Remembered,I was in this show over 20 years ago and had at that time only heard the LP!!! The quality of the recording coupled with my memories of the show made the purchase totally worth my while. It was everything I remembered.
3,Memory Card,"It works just fine, which is all to be expected. This rating system is forcing me to rate it as a game which just doesn't apply."
5,Great movie,"I love this movie it's funny, it makes you cry and smile and it has a great message. I love it and my 10 yr old daughter loves it. My baby boy (7 months) liked it too!!!!"
4,Good story and message for kids,"Enjoyed this movie and enjoyed the message it teaches kids. There are some funny inserts for adults as well. Good watch, at least once."
5,"Very Funny, predicable but still original!","Okay, so you probably know where the movie is going after the first 30 minutes, but for some reason you don't really mind. The plot may be cookie cutter, but it is presented in a very funny and original way.I think the animation looks spectacular on Blu-ray. The sound is also great.The minions are what make the movie, simple as that. They are hilarious!"
4,Big Package for the Money,"I'm not much of a Steve Carell fan, but as long as you have a 3D system, this is one for the library. Enjoyable entertainment for all with all the extras. With the choice of 3D, Blu-Ray, DVD, and Digital Copy, even if you plan on upgrading your system it's worth it."
4,Very Entertaining,"Very entertaining film. Nobody nails story lines quite like Pixar... but still an outstanding family film. Creative, colorful, unique and funny. Enjoyed every minute."
5,Great Experience,"This pack of DESPICABLE ME is great, with the movie in BluRay and BluRay 3D, with a unique qualitty, great stuff"
4,Good Movie,Both adults and children can enjoy the humor. We watched the movie in 3D. Some effects really play well in the this version.
1,Underwhelmed,Ordered this movie for my niece and she did not find this very entertaining.Will not be ordering similar movies in the future.
2,Are you serious Universal!,"Okay, first; it says a Blu ray 3D,Blu ray, DVD, and Digital Copy. I only got 3d and digital copy. I was REALLY expecting a dvd, for something to watch on car trips. I don't have a laptop, ipod, and all that digital copy stuff. Wow. Just wow. Don't trust this tempting Blu Ray disk. BEWARE!!!"
2,Single Disc Edition problem,"The single disc, NTSC Dual Layer DVD edition didn't work for us when I tried to playback on the Sony PS3. These manufacturers and these movie studios could be a bit more accommodating, and not make it so difficult or complicated in order to play back movies that are purchased. While they're at it, the movie studios should also do away with region codes."
2,"Great movie, bad quality",Got the dvd for my girlfriend's birthday and it worked fine until 30 minutes into it and it started skipping from there all the way to the end of movie. It was very frustrating considering the product info stated that it was in great shape. Not buying from this sender again.
2,Not a four disc combo,I just recently opened this package for my nieces and come to find out that the digital copy was NOT included! I am disappointed that I trusted what I was buying and did not take a closer look.
2,It's ok...,"Despicable me is not a terrible movie or anything, but most of the movie seems like cheap slapstick moments. Nothing really keeps any of the scenes together to find it really funny, or really interesting. Great for distracting little kids, but that is about it."
5,Linda!,"Es una película muy linda =0). Me encanta el final con los abrazos, al final todos queremos un abrazo de alguien."
3,Opened My Eyes,when i first was getting ready to write my review i was going to give it 5 stars!! i loved the movie thought it was very funny. after reading some of the lower reviews one customer made a very good point about the girls being in an orphange and the box of shame. and i totally agree now. even though i still like this movie i dont think children in an orphange is something to poke fun at. i know it is just a cartoon but stuff like that does actually happen and its sad.
3,Good movie,"Good movie, not so bad I recommend it :)Good movie I recommend it :)Good movie I recommend it :)Good movie I recommend it :)"
5,Great customer service!,The DVD was sent quickly. The DVD had a defect. The replacement DVD was sent right away! The customer service was great! Thanks!
3,Not bad at all!,"Although I bought the movie for the 3D effects (which are good by the way), the movie itself is not bad at all. The kids have enjoyed it and so did I."
3,Despicable Me,"Purchased this movie becuase the the TV ads made it look like it was going to be a very funny movie, but it was ok. I would rent it instead of buying it."
4,Fun little 3D movie,"My girlfriend and I picked out Despicable Me to test out our new 3D TV. We didn't expect too much from the movie, but we were pleasely surprised. The 3D looked great, and the story was fun and made us laugh, even at 20+ years old. It probably won't go down in history, but the film is certainly worth a watch."
3,Descpicable ME,We got this movie very fast thanks to Amazon Prime shipping but the movie itself was not my favorite movie. It was a slow movie and a typical villain movie.
5,My favorite animated film!,"I can't wait until number two comes out this summer! My Grandson calls this the ""bouncy movie"", because of all the minions that jump around in this movie; they make the movie not only different, but fun!"
5,Despicable Me,arrived fast and as promised. Great movie for grandma's house. This was one of several movies I ordered during Amazon movie sale. Can't wait for another sale..
3,Despicable Me,"Cute movie, my younger siblings liked, I liked it, and my dad even like it, except for one thing, the rude humour. When it was rated PG for rude humor, I was not expecting what was on it. Besides that it was funny and engaging."
3,Very entertaining,We enjoyed the movie and I loved the characters - especially Julie Andrews! I found I needed a list of the actors who voiced the roles in front of me!Wonderful plot and clever script.
3,TITLE: Despicable Me,"It just wasn't what I like. I can't really put my finger on what I didn't like about it, just that I had an overwhelming urge to turn it off almost from the beginning..."
5,great kids movie,This is one of my favorite movies for my daughter. It also keeps the parents attention which.is very nice. This is a must buy movie.
5,"up, monsters vs aliens, kung fu panda, cloudy with a chance...","we all loved it. male/female, ages 34,32, and 2. a great family film with lots of laughs & heart warming story. added to my favorites........if you like these : cloudy with a chance of meatballs, monsters vs aliens, kung fu panda, you'll like this one."
5,Better than Toy Story 3,"This was the first movie that myself and my twin 5-year-old boys laughed at equally. The adult humor is excellent and subtle at times that you really need to pay attention. We just saw Tangled in the theater and one of my boy's said ""mommy this is a good movie, but it is not as funny as Despicable Me."" My children ask daily when we are getting a copy of the movie and I told them we have to wait and see if Santa brings it for them. This movie was not hyped as much as Toy Story 3 which I did not like nearly as much."
4,Great fun movie,"This is a good movie. A little bit of crude humor, and lots of minion laughing that is contagious--makes my kids start laughing which then makes me laugh!"
1,Great movie! Too bad Amazon sent me a damaged copy,"I loved this movie when it was in theatres, and was looking forward to the DVD and the extra minion movies. The double pack is supposed to come with a digital copy as well, and I was looking forward to loading that on my iPad. What I got was a broken case and torn cover, and no digital copy at all -- just the movie and the extras. It's a darn good thing I wasn't giving this as a gift."
1,Dispicable Me,I definitely got my movie in a timely manner but was sold a piece of junk. I put the movie in and 10th minutes into it the movie froze. It wouldn't play the rest of it from that point. I took the movie out and cleaned the disc with a Maxwell dvd cleaner and it still didn't play past that specific part. While cleaning it I noticed a decent sized lil pot hole in the disc that I'm really not sure can be fixed. It's because of that spot that the movie won't play. I suggest that family video check their movies before sending them out.
1,Oh My!,"Well, the first half of the movie should have been redone. [Or at least left on the editing floor.] The second half has humor and some sentiment but, I am hard pressed to see it's merits for children or even adults of a childish nature. You really need characters to whom one can be relate or are at least recognizable in some imaginary life. Same thing for the antagonist. I have seen more dimension in a single blank sheet of paper. The underlying story of the hard hearted bad guy going soft over the helpless guiless child, needed a lot more development, that it did not get. Whoever did the little yellow guys got it. The director didn't, in my opinion. If you get it half price and skip through the first half, then you might get your money's worth."
1,DVD problem,The movie that i ordered does not work. i have tried a lot of times. It came with another disk which doesn't work either.
1,disc wont play without skipping scenes,this disc was decribed new and the seal was broken and the disc has scratches all over the thing this is insane i demand a refund
5,Great movie,Love this movie... so does my GF. The minions are great.... it's perfect for kids and adults alike as it has humor for both. I will watch over and over.
4,Imaginative wit,"In ""Despicable Me"" there is a scene where Gru enters a Bank which funds VILLAINS and is called The Bank of Evil - at the entrance there is a plate which reads ""formerly Lehman Brothers"". Need I say more about the wit and humour in the movie. It is hilarious."
5,Lightbulb!,"Absolutely delightful! I started out a bit skeptical but I found the movie to be entertaining and wonderful. My kids, ages 6,4 and 2 love the movie and the extra features that come on the blu ray disk. I would highly recommend this movie as my kids are constantly asking to watch it again. You will love it!"
4,Cute!,"I got this movie for my brothers. Ages 14,11,8 and 5. They all love it! It's a super cute movie! Very family friendly!"
4,Fun movie for all,This is a fun movie for adults as well as children.our 6 year old really enjoys it as well as the neighbors 10 and 12 year old boys. Good fun film for all.
5,Excellent movie to watch with friends and family!,Just loved this movie on theaters and I had to own it. I hope that they make a second part pretty soon!
5,My 10 year old loves this movie,This movie was on the Christmas list and she was so excited when she opened the box and saw it. She watched the movie later on in the day and was happy to have it. I know she'll be watching it again sometime soon.
4,Despicable Option,"I love this movie! Packaging was great and there are 3 DVD's included. For good entertainment you can't go wrong with this movie. To me, the price was right and after watching it you know I had to have it. Great for the kids and I am sure most adults would love it."
5,Hilarious,"Great, great movie. Comedy gold. The characters are hilarious and the songs get stuck in your head for days. My kids LOVE IT!"
5,The funniest animated movie this year,"Pros:Funny for kids and adults alikeGreat musicNot too long or too shortNo singing (yeah!)Cons:There is some violence with guns and explosions; however, this was a big part of the dynamic of the movie. Still a good one!"
5,Love this Movie!,My kids love the minions in particular. It is a really fun film. Not hard at all to suspend disbelief and just accept this film.
4,Good movie for kids,There is enough action to keep five year olds entertained and it moves enough to keep adults from getting bored.
5,Very satisfied!,"For grandson, at his request. I have heard very many favorable reports on this movie.Look forward to watching with him!"
5,Funny movie,This is a really funny movie... Waiting for the sequel and I hope the minions appear more in that movie. The minions really steal the show.
5,So funny,"Great movie for kids and adults alike. Steve Carrell's voice *makes* the movie. It's original, fun, clean and after my 3-year old's 10th time watching, still funny."
5,Awesome!!,"When I got the DVD it was in top shape, no scratches or anything. No broken clips or f*ed up stuff. Very good!!"
4,An Enteraining Movie For The Entire Family in 3D,"Having just installed a new 3D TV I have been on a random buying spree trying to acquire 3D movies. This one had received some good reviews so I decided to add it to my collection as a 3D demo disc.Well it turned out the movie has not only some good 3D moments, but is also fun to watch even though I'm way past childhood. The movie is whimsical, light-hearted and full of fun; a good family movie. We'll be watching it again soon!It was interesting to note that some of the best 3D effects occur as the final credits roll so be sure and keep your glasses on and watch the final credits.I can recommend this movie for both the movie and the 3D effects."
5,love this movie,"This movie is so cute and funny. I love it. I bought it from Amazon cause it was the lowest price compared to Best buy, Walmart, or Target."
5,FIne family movie,It is a good movie appropriate for all ages. My family enjoyed it and my brother who is 21 even wanted to buy it. It's a fine movie. It's not exactly as inexpensive as it COULD be but I'd say it's worth it.
4,This Movie!!!,I was thrilled to purchase this to have it in my collection. My 8 year old and I sit and watch this over and over and still roar over it. The minions are so funny and Gru (Steve Carell) is despicably entertaining. Good mix of characters in this and there really aren't any low parts because the minions fill in spaces.
5,Movie,Despicable Me is a cute movie with a good message about being good or bad. It isn't just for kids. Very enjoyable.
5,Cute,My little brother wanted this movie so i ordered it last minute for Christmas and it arrived in two days which is amazing. Our entire family likes the movies so it was a cool gift.
5,One of the funniest movies!,My almost 4 year old twins love this movie! They have watched it over and over. Very cute storyline as well.
4,CUTE MOVIE!!!,very cute movie - really enjoyed it - great for kids and grown ups! :) (i don't know what else to write - been awhile since i rented it - but amazon wouldn't let me publish just up to the smiley face - so now i'm writing this nonsense...sorry.)
1,NEVER RECIEVED IT,I NEVER RECIEVED MY PURCHASE AND THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ONE OF MY DAUGHTERS' CHRISTMAS PRESENTS... I AM HIGHLY DISAPOINTED AND I CAN NOT EVEN FILE A CLAIM!
2,Hated it.,"Loud. Violent. Bathroom jokes. Couldn't understand most of what Steve Carel said. No characters drew me in, very little humor. Big disappointment. We left in the middle at my kids' request!"
2,Missable,"Unsuccessfully evil scientist, cute little girls, Grinchian change of heart. Did I miss anything? Oh, the evil arch-nemesis and business competitor with a twenty-to-one ratio of ego to rational reason for it.Good kids' movies keep the young ones entertained, but still offer a some wit for the grownups who shell out for them. Then there's this kind. I'm glad I didn't pay monmey to see it - and glad that I had a book to read.-- wiredweird"
1,Stupid movie,"A souless remake of The Grinch. Jeepers, there have o be better family movies. this movie doesn't warrant six more words"
2,DISAPPOINTED,"WAITING TO SEE THIS, AND VERY DULL, NOT FUNNY, NOT SURE KIDS WOULD EVEN LAUGH AT IT. JUST DRY AND DRUG OUT."
5,Great movie!,"Great family movie. Wonderful lessons to be learned, such as even the toughest hearts can be softened with patience and love."
4,Hillarious. Fun for adults and kids,We bought this movie for our 2 year old son as a gift and watched it Christmas day. He loved it and we did too. The minions are adorable. Mr. Gru is incredible is both dispicable and loveable at the same time and the plot was well developed enough to entertain both adults and children. I suspect that this is going to be on the frequent play list at our house for months to come.
5,Hilarious!,"I loved it! In fact, I saw it twice. I think the 3D version was awesome but I did view both. Favorite part was the dog dish and newspaper..don't want to give too much away!"
5,"Just Loved This Film - It Gru on me and if you're not compleatly jaded, will on you!","I get a little annoyed at people that compare a single film to a almost institutional film like Pixar's Toy story,(and I love Toy Story 1,2,&3) but its also unfair. Your comparing 15 years of history that has had time to grow and mature, against a film that has just come out. I love Despicable Me for it's mold breaking story of Villain Vs. Villain, Youth Vs. Mature and it's over the top portrayal of the characters. In a world where there appear to be no super heros, and Villains go to banks to get loans for their scams, and the gags are there for both children and adults. I give it 10 out of ten for its newness, the same as How to Train Your Dragon another film with a refreshing spark of humour ."
4,I liked this movie,"I saw this movie in theatres and I liked it. It is a little sad because Gru is strict at first and he only takes in 3 orphan girls to get something from another villian.anyway, but the movie was pretty good, a little sad and had an innappropriate part, but other than that it was pretty good."
4,Funny and Delightful,"A super villain named Gru (Steve Carrell) has an evil plan to shrink the moon, but first he has to get his hands on a shrink ray that his arch enemy Vector (Jason Segal) has. Vector orders cookies from 3 orphans a lot, so Gru comes up with a scheme to adopt the orphans in order to get in Vector's house and get the ray. He starts to get closer to the 3 girls though, which wasn't part of his plan.The movie is heartwarming and constantly funny and Gru's team of little yellow minions made me want one of my own."
3,"Decent movie, shoddy picture","I'm reviewing two seperate things here: one, the movie, and two, the Amazon video on demand delivery of the movie.The movie itself is pretty good. Not a Pixar quality movie with great character development and so on, but a good renter.The VOD: I have a recent Panasonic Blu Ray player with integrated Amazon interaction. It's hardwired to a router, and the router is wired to a cable modem. Since everything is wired for HD, I spent the extra dollar and went with the HD Amazon movie. Poor choice, as it turns out. The picture was certainly watchable, but it had a fair amount of compression loss and pixilization - big square blotches in random spots of similar color and the like. The actual definition was also not ""high definition"". Had I seen the same thing on the standard definition movie, I don't think I would have thought much of it. Stay away from the high definition. It's more money for the same movie."
5,Family favorite!,"So many funny and well developed characters. There is kid humor and laughs for just the adults. ""It's so fluffy I could die!"" Is a favorite of ours."
4,Despicable Me : Disappointing?,"At first, I thought Despicable Me is one of those boring, trying-hard to be funny animated 3D movie, but I was wrong. I watched it with my sister after the package, from Amazon, arrived, and it was fantastic. The minions were high-larious, and the plots of the story were great. Evil, comedy, mother and son relationships, father and daughter relationships, even a little girl and a unicorn relationships, all are there. Nothing to say anymore, but LOL! A must see. Watch it with your friends, family, siblings, or ever with you pets and unicorns. That's how amazing this movie is. Can't wait to see ""Hop"", the sequel to this movie, as I know of. Correct me if I am wrong guys. So, Despicable Me : Disappointing? Not at all. I'll give this movie four stars."
4,Great Movie! ... but bonus features only on Blu-ray :(,Great movie with lots of subtle adult humor and references. I don't have a blu-ray player yet so I was very disappointed that we could not see the 3 mini-movies.
5,Funny and Touching,I bought this movie for my collection specifically because it is both heartwarming and really funny at the same time. The minions are hilarious throughout the entire film and it just melts your heart to see how the 3 little girls from the orphanage change an evil villain into a really caring father figure. I consider this a must-have movie for when you need some cheering up.
5,The kids love it.,"If you want a movie that will hold your toddler's undivided attention for 90+ minutes, this is a good one. Right up there with Toy Story."
5,WONDERFUL TIME!!!,"Love those minions! ! Gru and the girls are okay too. I have never laughed so much... well maybe at Tangled too. But the minions make this movie. My granddaughter barrel laughs at the minions and at Gru when he has ""lightbulb"" moments. I would recommend this movie for everyone! !! Nobody should miss out on seeing this movie now."
4,Pure fun!,"The film is excellent. Pure fun. Just to be a bit critical, they could have explored a little more certain characters as the main character's mother and the scientist (whose relationship with Gru seemed kind of dubious, sometimes as his assistant, sometimes giving him orders). They also might have granted us with more 3D effects. But in short, well worth watching."
5,Wonderful kids show!,This movie is a wonderful kid's show! It is really cute. The minions are adorable! This one definitely gets played on a regular basis! Well worth the money! Recommended for anyone with little kids.
5,My favorite animation movie ever!,"For all ages... a day of pure fun! Top notch!Got to love Grew and, of course, the minions!Fantastic!!!"
3,"OK, But not as funny I expected",I can't really say why I didn't enjoy this as much as I enjoy the Pixar stuff. Perhaps it is because this is truly for kids with no overtones for adults.
4,"Good movie, not scratched, but in one of those cheapy thin cases","Def. glad i bought this movie, i loe to watch it and I enjoy it, but I was sad to see it came in one of those really thin dvd cases that are cheaper. So -1 star, but the dvd is still good!"
4,It was so fluffy!,Better than I expected on an Adult level. It was actually a moive you could let you small children watch. .
3,Interesting movie,"Bought this movie as a Christmas present for my two-year-old son. He seems to like the movie, but I have yet to watch it. It was a good price, so I'm happy with the purchase."
3,despicable me,"Item was purchased as birthday present for granddaughter. Gift presented early April. Don't know reaction as yet but it was on her ""want list""."
2,I wanted to like it . . . .I really did.,"I really like Steve Carell, and I tried to enjoy this, but I just couldn't get into it. It lacks the clever multi-level humor I'm used to from the classic Pixar films like Toy Story and A Bugs Life. I found myself becoming bored with the plot after about 30 minutes, and the characters weren't interesting enough to really grab me. It seems to be a hit with the kids - my girlfriend's 9 year old son enjoyed it, but I don't think it has enough substance to maintain an adult's interest."
4,Cute movie that has good moments,"The movie offers a typical plot of good triumphing over evil. This time, three little girls (orphans) overcome the disinterest of a man who attempts to be the most evil person alive. Along the way, there are a number of quotes and scenes that offer amusement and make it worth watching the movie.I enjoy this type of movie primarily for the adult humor embedded in the children's animations. The length is about right, and the plot is reasonably believable."
5,Despicable Me Review,"Love this movie and having all the different way to view it was a bonus!! Oh and the bonus features, thank you!"
5,hilarious family fun,"First, I dont write a lot of product or movie reviews...but this one is worthy. This is absolutely one of the funniest, most enjoyable movies we've seen in quite awhile. There are touching moments as well as hilarious times....everyone was laughing out loud. Visuals / graphics are outstanding. Every bit as good as compared to any Disney / Pixar work. Cant go wrong...highly recommended."
4,GOOD 'EVIL' FUN,"Steve Carell, and Jason Segel are excellent as the world's once greatest supervillain, and his supplanter in this hilarious, sometimes sophomoric, but never boring story of twisted aspirations, and unintended redemption. Normally the rule of thumb in movies is that kids, and dogs usually steal any scene they're in, regardless of whether acting is required- not so here. Little, round, googly-eyed, often inept, overtly clumsy, yellow critters, otherwise known as minions almost eliminate the need for a script. Julie Andrews as Carell's less-than-caring mom is also quite wonderful. I'm not a huge fan of 3-D, but DESPICABLE ME uses it well. Great, silly fun, with very decent animation. It might be a bit scary for the very young."
5,Absolutely love this movie!,"If you haven't seen this, you need to! I am a huge Steve Carell fan, but I really love this story because in the end its really about adoption and since we adopted our 6 month old little man, I love any positive story about adoption."
5,There are all kinds of families...minions of them!,"Great movie for kids and adults, too! A nice, moral message without being preachy. As a mom who is also adopted, it kind of explains to them that there are families of all kinds...but the thing they have in common (even the ones with minions) is love."
4,Funny with heart,"My entire family really enjoyed this movie. It was funny and heartwarming without being overly cloying or mushy. Also, there are some clever references for adults ""Bank of Evil, formerly Lehman Brothers"". Highly recommended."
5,hilarious,excellent movie. clean for children and humor for adults as well. can't wait for part 2 to come out !!
5,GREAT,This was a very very good family movie. Very entertaining. Great story line. The music was also good. Great purchase.
4,Great movie for kids,I bought this item to please my daughter on long rides in the car. Now she wants to watch it every day. The digital copy was a nice surprise and is handy on portable devices.
5,Throughly enjoyable,"Hilarious. Fun. Really entertaining. I really liked this movie and would watch it again. The storyline was cute, the animation really well-drawn, and those little yellow things are so funny. That's all that needs to be said. Watch it!"
5,Despicable Me 3D,"I've seen this advertised but didn't figure I would care for it, being an adult with grown kids and such. Well, my daughter got this for me as a Christmas gift, and that evening we all watched it together. The 3D effects are as good as you see in any theater these days, but the jist of it all is that I laughed nearly the entire length of the movie. IMHO, the movie does what it is supposed to do, transport us for a couple of hours and entertain. It still may not be for everyone, but it does appeal to a broad audience. If you have kids, you can relate to it. If you are a kid, you can relate as well. I was pleasantly suprised, and laughed until I cried. Reminded me of some of the ""old"" cartoons I watched as a kid."
3,OKAY,"I was looking forward to seeing this, but it wasn't as good as I was expecting. It was OKAY but not great"
3,"For young kids, great fun",Eight-year-old grandson loves this movie. Wants to watch it every time he comes to visit. Good price. Good fun. Good evening at home.
3,Very cute,"A very cute movie - not too taxing. It's fun for kids, and not excruciating for parents. Nothing earth-shattering, but no real complaints either."
4,like it alot. So did partner,"My boyfriend and I normally don't agree on movies or TV shows. He likes Stooges, and I can only stand so much of the same joke. We both like this. My favorite Pixars are Cars, Nemo and Toy Story. I got a new DVD copy for cheap, and was surprised to like it a lot. I didn't get blu-ray or digital copy for my version. All I'm concerned about is the movie itself. I can imagine blu-ray would be stunning. I'd re-buy it in the BR format but I heard a lot of problems with them so I won't."
4,"Disc in great shape, not so much cover","The disc is in great condition, however there are labels on the case that makes it appear it was once in a rental store. This was not specified in description, so this is a bit frustrating."
5,Funny and Heart Warming,"My family and I love this film. The minions and girls are lovable from the start and the ""hero"" grows on you very quickly. I highly recommend it for any family."
5,Despicable Me is wonderful and heartwarming,"This movie is so adorable, the entire family loves it. We are all looking forward to another one being made."
5,Great movie for the whole family,This movie is good for the whole family. Both my son and daughter like this movie. It is a heartfelt movie about a bad guy turning good and finding love in the place he least expects it. I even enjoy watching this movie with the kids.
1,Badly scratched DVD,"We ordered ""Despicable Me"" DVD from Newbury Comics via amazon. Despite the description that this DVD was new it was scratched and stopped playing about 40 minutes into the movie. This was for our child's birthday party and we had to scramble to get a different DVD in the middle of the showing. We ordered one more DVD ""How to train your dragon"" which had the same problem and stopped playing in the middle. Really disappointing products."
1,Absolute waste of time,Maybe I do not have a good sense of humor but this movie was such a waste of time - the actual plot is just absolutely stupid as well as most of the jokes used in the movie
1,MISSING DIGITAL COPY,"I have gotten this 2 times and each time the outer sleeve says that it includes the digital copy, but the internal casing is only for the Blu-ray and DVD. I don't know if there are different fulfillment centers but you should check yours to see if the internal plastic contains the digital copy."
1,Not for kids,"The language and rude humor make this movie inappropriate for children. Scenes like the minions photocopying their bare bottoms, the mad scientist inventing a ""fart gun,"" Vector's pelvic thrusting, ... too many offensive things to name them all. It should be rated PG-13 instead of PG. Even so, I wouldn't allow my 14 year old to watch this movie. Save your money for something worthy of your kids' attention."
1,Predictable and silly nonsense movie,"I really wanted to like this movie, but i just found it to be predictable and silly and all the story is a nonsense wreck. I took my two children ages 3 and 5 to see it in 3D one month after watching Toy Story 3 (wich they enjoyed from start to the end), but after 30 minutes watching Despicable Me both of them where standing from they're seats and getting busy just playing arround. This is a lame Universal Pictures copycat of Disney-Pixar movies."
4,Much Cuter and More Original Than I Predicted,"Parents you really don`t have to roll your eyes too hard at this one. Especially you Fathers out there, actually this one is for you. This is about Young vs. Old and Supervillians and Fatherhood."
3,"Good, not great","The movie starts off VERY slow, to the point that we wondered if it would ever get funny, but it did. Once the little girls are added to the mix, the movie gets much better. I don't think it is a classic by any means, but the ending was very touching, and the voices were very well done. The film was playful, but had a lot of missed opportunities for laughs, etc. My young nephew really enjoyed it, but the rest of the room really felt that it was almost slow enough to turn off the DVD."
2,Whose humor?,"I really can't think of an appropriate audience for this movie. There was a lot of bathroom humor which wasn't funny to me as an adult and really wasn't appropriate for young children. Ex: Photo copying butts? There were a few scenes that were actually funny and not bathroom related and the three orphans were pretty cute which is why I gave the movie a couple of stars. However, it wasn't worth my time or money."
1,"Great Movie, Buy the DVD","Hate BD-Live. Haaaaaaaaate it!It forces you to watch like 20 minutes of Studio propaganda before it lets you watch the movie you just bought and paid for. And just to make sure you know what a sucker you were, one of the commercials is about how great BD-Live is. Only in Hollywood could something like this seem like a good idea."
2,A Poor Man's Pixar,"I found this story to be trite and dull and lacking in any of the humanity that I have come to love and cherish with the Pixair movies. Despicable Me is dull and that is its worst failing. It has characters which are even more cartoonish than you would find in a cartoon. I found the plot very dull and difficult to follow. Not because it was overly complex, but due to the fact it was just so poorly written.I also disliked the fact that the film lacked the genuine humanity of such great films as Toy Story or Wall-E or any of the Pixair movies. Those films have a level of humanity which is completely lacking in this film. If you get this for free it's worth your time. Otherwise it's not a very good movie."
1,Really didn't like it,"Steve Carell seems to always be funny, but this movie was dark. Dark humor--things that kids just shouldn't see. I was glad my husband and I watched it before showing our kids. There's a whole message about stealing in there (that it's ok) and I'm surprised that although the main character did change in some respect by the end of the movie, there's never a message about ""I was wrong for stealing things and am going to stop."" Yes, I know this is a comedy, but having the little girl go into a torture case where it looks like she's been literally pinned to death is disgusting and morbid. If you buy this movie, please please watch it before you show your kids, because kids do not have the emotional maturity to understand some of these things that are being played out for ""comedy's sake"". We threw this in the trash."
5,Great Purchase,The gift was a wonderful surprise for my wife. The inflatable minion has also come in handy when little kids are around. I am satisfied with this purchase
5,Fun for all,This was a fun movie for everyone in the family. My children ages 3 to 8 love the movie. And so did daddy and mommy. Great for movie night
3,Boring movie - Great Blue Ray,"Dull movie. Likable minions but not enough of them. Very nice technical transfer, sound and 3D. Good movie to demo your system but I can't imagine watching more than once."
3,"Worth the rental, but not to own","This came highly recommended by a few friends - but I think their appraisals were based primarily on how much their kids enjoyed it, and not on their own opinions."
3,Cute but not gripping,"This movie did not grip my full attention. Several parts were very humorous though and I very much hope a little kitten book comes out because I want one! The characters are adorable, the minions are a bit strange (but I suppose they are supposed to be). We rented this one and I am glad we did instead of purchasing it."
3,Moderate,This movie must have been oriented to the very young generation as I did not see where all the hype was worth it. Although it is a good movie it is not great in my opinion. My niece however says it is the best movie she has ever seen in her seventeen years of movie reviews.
3,not what I expected,I really enjoy animated movies. This was a OK but not a great movie. I would rent it first if you are considering to purchase this for you own use.
3,Pretty Good,Steve Carell is not that funny as the lead voice; the other characters do a better job of being entertaining. Overall the movie has its funny moments and is good for the family.
5,OMG!!,"Our four year old granddaughter has claimed it as her very own! Let's see... I believe she has watched this particular movie over and over and over again at least 20 times since we purchased it! Grampa and Gramma have truly enjoyed it, as well. It definitely leaves you rolling on the floor with laughter!"
5,Great Movie For Kids,"I got these for my kids, but even adults have fun watching the movie. Steve Carrell does a wonderful performance."
4,Great movie,"This is a great movie for all ages. Also, the blu-ray quality is excellent on this movie. A must have for every kid's collection."
5,great film,"I wasn't sure what to think of this movie at first, but by its completion I had decided it was among my favorites. It's surprisingly touching!"
4,Very cute,This was a very cute movie that reminded me of my own dad: tough exterior and a very tender heart for his girls. I recommend for adults and kids alike.
5,"IT WAS BETTER THE ""UP""","FUN FOR ALL AGES, I HAVE TO PURCHASE THIS, WATCHED IT WITH MY SON, LAUGHED THE WHOLE TIME..JUST AS GOOD AS TOY STORY!!!"
4,Hilarious.,"Sometimes, famous actors voicing animated characters are so recognizable that you can't help but picture the actor in your mind, slightly taking away from suspension of disbelief. That is not the case here, and both the animation and the voice acting are absolutely delightful. Great for all ages."
5,Great Movie,You know the first time I watched this was at the theater. And truthfully I did not like it as much as I did this time. Could be the sticky floors the family in front with the fussy child or a miriad of other things.This movie is hilarious. The minions add an extra diminsion and made me laugh. And the inventor guy that does not hear so well and some of the things he makes. It is a great movie and my hubby who is not crazy about cartoons like I am even enjoyed it.
5,One of the best family movies out there!,"I bought a second copy of this movie after we ""wore out"" the first. This movie is lovely on all levels! It is funny, heartwarming, and clever to boot!"
5,good,Came in really quick and movie was clear and brand new! Was not damaged at all. One ofbthe best cartoon films ever!
4,Good Movie,"I really like this movie. My wife and I watched it in theaters, and she wanted to watch it again. Was it worth the $2-3 to see it again?..probably not. First time viewers, go for it. 2nd timers...check red box."
4,LOVE LOVE LOVE,We LOVE this movie!! It is totally hilarious for both kids and adults in my opinion. It will be a classic.
5,Great movie,Im not big on new movies and i barely even watch tv but i feel this was a great title worth a watch
4,Fun movie,"Great movie to watch on the couch with your girlfriend.... silly, funny & cute and doesn't last to long. "" No I said dart gun..."""
4,Good movie poor delivery by Amazon,I ordered a copy on Cyber Monday. When my copy arrived there was no redeem code for the digital copy. I sent it back. I got a replacement that arrived with a redeem code but with the case broken in several spots. I may send this one back but I'm not sure i wanna find out what I'll get next time.
5,I Love It,It's one of my favorite movies though :)Got this Pack for less than $9.00I still haven't downloaded the digital copy :P
4,Worth watching,This is a cute movie worth watching with the family. Although its not an all time favorite hit it defintely has some funny parts that make it worthwhile. Its also one that has a reasonable story line to it.
5,Such a cute adorable movie!,Love this film! Carell is great as the villain you love to hate and the minions are hilarious. The kids are adorable but I'm scared how the sequel will do. Here's hoping they have as great of a story as they did in this first one!
2,mildly entertaining (2.5/5),"i found this movie mildly entertaining,with a few light chuckles here and there,but i don't think it wasn't as funny as i had hoped or expected it to be.there were no real 'laugh out loud,tears rolling down your face moments'.i think it was just a case of a lot of the jokes falling flat.it had some cute moments though,and of course there's a feel good ending.it's suitable for the whole family and kids will get a kick out of it.for me,it was just this side of boring.compared to a lot of animated films i've seen this one just doesn't stack up.having said that,however,it's far from being awful.it's just not great.for me,Despicable Me is a 2.5/5"
2,This one was hard to sit through.,"I had heard good comments about this movie from a lot of folks, so we watched it. I was surprised how bad we both thought it was. With high hopes, we kept watching in anticipation of some redeeming scene to make it all worth it, but that never came. It was difficult to sit through the whole thing to the end, but we did - regretting the decision."
3,It was ok.,"To be perfectly fair, my 5 yr old son and his 5 yr old friend loved this movie. I only give it an ""ok"" because I was looking forward to it making ME laugh with some extra humor for the adult crowd as well. It was cute either way. :)"
4,When bad guys go good,"Very cute movie. Funny plot and story line, hiding the great pyramid under a sky colored tarp...hilarious. I guess even super villans need a nemesis when no super heros are around."
5,must see!!! not just for kids!,"i loved this movie! it's one of those movies that you would think would only be good for kids, but adults will fall in love too! it has good humor and a sweet side to it as well. i give it 5 stars! and i will definitely be purchasing the DVD soon! :-)"
5,Quality Family Fun,"Unfortunately, I didn't get the chance to see this film at the theaters, but it was a great choice to get. My wife, daughters and I throughly loved it. Best part of all is that the humor in the movie was all clean, there was no uncomfortable ""adult humor"" stuck in there that I would have to explain to my kids. This is a great film for all ages depicting how a villain and his childish minions learns to love while competing against a new rival to commit the greatest crime. He soon grows to cherish the children he adopted as part of his scheme and becomes their hero."
5,great for kids and adults alike!,saw this movie at the theatre and had to have it to watch over and over! Great movie and must see!
4,We really like this one,"Although the characters are a little strange, by the end of the movie you learn to like them a lot."
5,Gift,This item was bought from a wish list. It was received in the time that was stated and it a good quality DVD.
5,AMAZING MOVIE,"This is the best family movie I've seen since Toy Story. This movie trumps all other films in its genre. Its enjoyable for all audiences; entertaining from start to finish for all ages. The humor touches everyone's and sequences through out the film pay homage to classics like Star Wars and Apollo 13. The visual presentation is stunning and the audio is fantastic. The extras are worth while too, unlike most other film extras which aren't entertaining. This package is well worth the price as its packed with great content."
5,Awesome movie!,My 4-year old and 7-year old really love this movie! I cannot tell you how many times they've watched this movie since we purchased it. Can't wait for 2!
5,OMG! What a riot!,We loved it! Very well rendered! Excellent attention to continuity and detail.The minions were great! The girls adorable! Loved it!
5,Excellent service,This movie is so funny ! We love watching it with the family on family game / movie night .
5,Great Movie,"Our 4, 7, and 10 year olds loved it. Easy to like as a parent too. I would even watch it even without them."
5,A great movie for family,"It's such a cute movie, how the little orphan girls change a mean mans heart! Entertaining and fun! You'll find yourself repeating some of the phrases in everyday life!"
5,Awesome!,"My one year old twins LOVE the minions. They watch them on YouTube constantly. We got this for them for Christmas, and they couldn't be happier. Such a cute movie."
5,Great moview,Great funny movie - bluray is stunning. Nothing else to report on - good movie - alot of laughs. Buy it.
3,"Weak Story, Great Characters","""Despicable Me"" has state of the art copy-cat Pixar animation and well-honed characters. The minions are darling and the three little orphan girls are sweetly sincere. The Villainous Gru (Steve Carell) has a soft heart underneath his evil exterior so you can guess the theme. Although the story as many creative points, the story sags with an over-abundance of frenetic attack scenes with odd weapons.The plot revolves around evil genius bad guys who want to out-do each other in bad deeds. This film will surely entertain the kids as a plot hatches to shrink and steal the moon as the most outlandish evil deed that can be done.The gadgets are fun, and the minions give creative boost, so it is entertaining, but just a tad weak for adults who have seen these type of plots before."
3,Good message but scary delivery for kids,I liked the final outcome and the message it delivered but most of the video consisted of scary and hurtful scenes. The protagonist and some of the characters are very mean. The children have to endure a lot of fright and rejection before they are finally victorious. I won't let my grandson see it.
3,Sweet but a bit violent for smaller children,Age range: 6 and up :) plot line was a little complicated and violent for me 4 year old but of course they can't make all movies a like.
4,Great time with the family.,"Its really funny, I love how the entire family can enjoy it and ive watched it over 10 times and its still not getting old."
4,Liiiiiiiiight bulb!,"Here's an idea, get a copy of this movie. Funny animated film, one that can be watched repeatedly and still be a hoot!"
5,"Great movie, made even better by Blu-ray","We love this movie, and rented it several times before buying the Blu-ray copy. The Blu-ray is definitely an upgrade. Even after seeing the movie a number of times, I always enjoy seeing the new things that you notice with a high-definition picture."
5,Gru from nasty to nice.,The Blu-ray qualify is superb.I like a well done redemption movies and this is a well done redemption cartoon. The adult characters and minions are all over the top and each little girl has a distinctive personality. Gru is endearingly grotesque and really grew on me.
5,Very enjoyable movie,"This movie is very funny. My hubby and I were laughing throughout the movie. It's fun seeing the animation in Blu-ray. I would definitely purchase this movie in Blu-ray again. It's a great value because it comes with the Blu-ray copy, regular DVD and a digital copy. Plus, it comes with the mini-movies, which are hilarious! The story is great, and there are lots of laughs along the way. Highly recommended!"
5,I wanted to hate it but ended up loving it,my wife picked this out for Friday night stay at home night. I groaned when she told me the selection. However in hindsight I should have stood up and clapped. This was a great movie despite the predictibility of bad turns to good with the help of a his adopted girls. You can see the plot a mile away but all in all this was a fun movie that left me wanting more. So far this is my favorite DVD of the year!
5,Best Movie EVER!!!,"I love this movie, my kids love this movie. I've only met one person who didn't love this movie. It's because it is funny and clean and the hero is a bad guy who's not what you expect. It shows that the real value in life is relationships, not stuff! I think everyone can benefit from hearing that message, especially in a funny way!"
1,DOESN'T WORK!!,I bought this for the kids for Christmas and it will not work! Won't even play on the computer. JUNK!
1,Blue Ray Disc can not see,The Blue Ray disc can not be viewed in the player. Get stuck most times. Only played the DVD copy
5,Love it!!,"We are so glad we found this movie, you guys were the only ones that had it after Christmas. Family favorite."
5,Very cute,My boys were entertained by all the gadgets and explosions. I liked the subtle humor. Very cute movie.
5,GREAT movie!,I'm in my 60s and this is one of my favorite movies. I love it!!! Love the animation and the snappy wit.
5,Fun 3D Campy Effects,"You loved this movie in 3D in the theaters and may have seen it in 2D at home, but this 3D Bluray version for home is the way to watch it. Minions reach right out at you as do other effects -from subtle to in your face!!! Great story-line for all ages."
1,Audio CD,This is the second Audio Book I've ordered that was not defined as MP3. I won't order from Amazon again on Audio Books.
1,trashy and not even good,"sometimes it's fun to read a mindless novel, but this one was even too mindless for me. there are better trashy novels out there."
3,A very funny book,This was a good book to take my mind off my problems. A great way to spend an afternoon when I couldn't do anything else.
4,Audio version delightful,"I listened to the audio version and it is delightful. Only five CDs, but enjoyable from start to finish. I want to make special mention of the reader Angela Dawe. I have been listening to a lot of audio books lately because of work travel and she is definitely one of my favorites."
2,Trust me on this,Not much to it. Story could use more character depth. I liked the story line it just needed more .
3,Fun and light,"Sooo.....I am a big fan of Crusie's work. Her books are usually a bit of a love story with a twist of mix up for laughs for the storyline. Generally, she uses the first 30 pages to describe each and every character before getting into the story. But for some reason, I did not care for this book at all. This story revolves around a crook, a reporter, a professor and a couple of government investigators that ended up with everyone in love!!! Since this is one of her earliest work, I think this was actually a cute, fun and light read. If you are looking for a no brainer book, then I probably would read this if you have some time to kill. But the bottom line is....you will probably never remember this story again after reading it."
2,"Not for the Crusie ""Hall of Fame""","I just got hooked on Jennifer Crusie after reading Fast Women over the summer. And since then I read Crazy for You and Bet Me (MY FAVORITE). This book took me forever to read because the plot line is slow, the chemistry is nothing special, and I was just straight up bored. Not Crusie's best book and doesn't have her usual pace where you're guessing because of the latest twist, turn, or passionate embrace. If you're new to Crusie (like I am), avoid this one until you've read most of her other stuff."
4,My answer for the photo problem,"I love it! Having seen it prior to receiving it as a gift, I decided to print photos on labels to intersperse in the book, particularly for the mushrooms not covered in the photo section. I think this will work well. Otherwise, since their Bolete book has been a savior for me, I figure this book will cover everything else."
4,Mushrooms of Northeastern North America,"Very big reference book packed with a huge amount of information to aid in the correct identification of mushrooms. This isn't a picture book to page through. Great in helping clear up some gray areas of doubt that may have been left by other field guides and websites. When it comes to mushrooms there are no ""stand alone"" sources of information but this one certainly helps."
5,A Fungus-Viewer's Pal,"This is a gorgeous book with BIG pictures which help in precisely identifying a found fungus. With the current wet, hot summer we've been having, mushrooms have been popping up overnight for weeks, and this book has been instrumental in letting us zero in on what we are seeing. Highly recommend."
4,Encyclopaedic!,This book is really impressive in its coverage. The description are quite complete (although somewhat lacking a section on the details differentiating one mushroom to its similar cousins) and the text is generally well organised. The reason why I gave only four stars to this book is simple: pictures and textual descriptions are separated in different sections! I guess I am still dreaming about a complete guide showing important identification details with pictures and text.
3,fairly comprehensive but hard to use. small pictures,this book has a wealth of information but it is organized poorly. the mushrooms are listed alphabetically with the pictures (which are ridiculously tiny) clumped incoveiniently at the end of each section. the annoying organization will have you flipping back and forth. don't expect alot of extra information on edibility or background info. get mushrooms demystified by dave aurora first or instead of.
2,Poorly designed book arranged in a frustrating manner.,"The tempting potential of this book title is definitely not realized upon holding it in your hands.Organized so that it doesn't facilitate ease of use, it falters as both a reference manual or guide. The photos are clumped at the back of each genus section with no correlating page numbers to link to the descriptions and the descriptions give no page numbers to link to the photos. Flip alphabetically through the photos and finally you will find what you are looking for. The color plates are small and not so helpful for identification. Who designs a book this way? The three authors of the book seem to want to make accessing their knowledge a difficult and aggravating procedure.I should have returned this volume before I creased the spine with all my exasperated page flipping.If your time is of the essence, this book will take up a lot of it.Bassette's North American BOLETES is arranged the same way."
3,shroomer,"Overall I have found this book helpful, but the layout of the photo reference section and the descripition that matches the photo is a little confusing. It would have been better to give a page number at the bottom of each photo linking it to the written description. I personally went thru my book and crossed referenced the photo to the page with description. I would like to say that the section on boletes is one of the better ones that I have seen so far. I would personal like to see photos of each mushroom in its complete life cycle. Alot of mushrooms look alot different when young. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in mushroom hunting. It is a great addition to add for beginners to serious mushroom hunters that enjoy the outdoors."
2,shag,"rip off - not at all what I expected. I expected lots more, this is really elementary. would like to return."
5,great for kids who hate sunscreen application,this is great for kids who dont like traditional sunscreen applied to their face. my son even hated the stick. this is the only way to apply without a meltdown.
3,Standards Movement or Standards Sabotage?,"Creating life-long learners is the goal of so many of teachers in America. But is that what is happening or have schools turned into ""test-prep"" centers that destroy our children's natural desire to learn? Alfie Kohn calls attention to the many affects of standardized tests on our students. Students who have a passion for and enjoy learning did not make his list. Psychological, emotional, and developmental effects are all explored in Kohn's video that urges teachers, schools, districts, and policy makers to move past the standards movement and put the students at the heart of education, not their test scores."
3,"Tough read, but worth it.","I have only read a few of Luther's works and knew it would be a tough read. There were parts I had to read 2 or 3 times in order to have full understanding. But, in the end I think it was worth my time and would recommend it to other Lutherans who would are interested in his writings."
5,Excellent for Tween-Girls (12 who think they are twenty),"Excellent lessons. Please take your time and pray at every opportunity to pray. Look at how your daughter reacts (reflects) during each lesson. Stop at every chance you see to pray for her soul, her heart, her love for Christ. Don't be in a hurry to finish a lesson. Take small bites. Ask gentle but honest questions. Be patient. Teach our youth to love Jesus. When they love Jesus, and see Jesus in us...they will listen, even when we think they are not listening. We as parents have to live the life we teach. God bless you."
2,Adventure Workshop,"There are three cd's that come in this package. One of the cds does not install, the other two work great. The cdrom that does not work is made by a different company than the other two. I am a computer programmer so I do know how to install the software. My daughter enjoys the other two cd's though and has learned a lot."
2,You can pass...,I bought this and owned it for two days. Its a decent MiniDV but you can do better at this price!Noise was a major issue. The motor is just loud and it gets picked up in quiet scenes pretty bad.Other than that the video recorded was of real good quality. But there was an issue with something going on when inserting a tape. It wasn't ejecting properly for some odd reason. I took it back after finding a deal on a Sony HC20 (that works a lot better/smoother than the Canon).The only reason why I got this was because it was recommended by an Apple rep... well - this isn't the best MiniDV out there at this price. Panasonic has a fantastic MiniDV for almost the same price... I'd pass on this one guys...
3,"Good, but has a fatal flaw...","I bought this camera for my husband for Christmas two years ago (2005). He used it and loved it...however, just after the 1 year warranty ran out, the camera malfunctioned. It will not turn on properly (you hear it, but cannot see anything on the screen) and will not eject the tape that's inside (with our precious memories on it!). We called Canon and apparently this is a COMMON and KNOWN problem with this model camera. They informed us that it would cost a minimum of $150 to just take a look at the camera and probably more for repairs and shipping. For that much money, we're just going to invest in a new camera with a company that STANDS BEHIND their products when there is a KNOWN DEFECT. I loved Canon products before, but will not be purchasing them from here on out."
1,BIG disappointment!,"I was given this as a gift. What a disappointment. We have had it in for repairs and replacement parts. And still multiple problems. It malfunctions and will not allow tapes in it or worse it just turns off and won't respond.Oh yeah now it has a noise like the motor is reving and it won't playback or tape anything. Canon only fixed it once under warrenty now again I have to pay. If you don't mind that you miss all the special moments or that the odds are good it won't work then this camera is for you! Also, don't expect the company to stand behind their product because they really don't care."
1,Grainy picture,"We received this camcorder for a Christmas gift 2005. We were not impressed at all. When we tried to record our opening gifts in a living room, the picture looked terrible. It looked bad on the view finder & even worse on the television. We thought that it was possibly the lighting at my mother's house. So we tried it at home in our living room with an over head light, and the natural light from outside, it was still terrible. Our digital photo camera took clearer videos than this camera. The only time we could get the video to look semi clear was below our incredibly bright track lighting! Well, clearly you won't have that light quality hardly anywhere. Needless to say, we returned the camera, after exchanging it once because we thought it was a lemon. We ended up going with the Sony HC21 and are much happier with it!"
2,USB MY FOOT!!!,"Per the manufact...""The ZR100 features both a DV terminal (IEEE 1394 or Firewire) and USB terminal for connection to a DV-compatible computer or another DV-camcorder""LIE LIE LIE. Sorry but I don't want to install the firewire so back to the store it goes as in the instruction book there is NO reference to a USB cable. nor is there any plug to plug one into...lie lie lie. so its cool if I want to plug the camera into my tv to watch video but I can't do any cool editing or save it to DVD."
2,The Evictors,"It's Different is that Good Or bad? Not sure. Maybe I am used to more Violent Scary Movies Sadly and I have been desensitized to Suspense or Mystery type movies, I can say the movie is slow paced but it does have it's moments, Not an Alright Horror but still worth watching."
2,Not Original Or Good,"This is an Amityville-Horror haunted house knock off -- though it is great to see Michael Parks of Then Came Bronson fame, together with Jessica Harper and Vic Morrow. One would think that with a cast of this power, a better movie would have resulted."
5,Fabulous audiotape,"The Pariswalks audiotape is an immensely entertaining and educational way to wander through Paris neighborhoods. You can, for a change, SEE what the guidebooks are talking about WITHOUT having your nose in the book the whole time. The narration is humorous as well as informative. Because this Pariswalks audiotape is so good,I have given theLondonwalks audiotape on faith for Christmas to someone about to head for London. I will never travel to Europe again without first checking to learn whether an audiotape is available for my destination city."
3,Chapter 7 Review,"Chapter 7 in this book is titled Thermal Behavior. This chapter discusses the fundamentals of thermal behavior. I think that the author has done a good job of discussing the basics of thermal behavior in materials. The author discusses heat capacity and thermal expansion, conductivity, and shock. While I believe that the reading is easy I think the setup of the charts and sample problems could use some work. The chapter text and the sample problems are hard to separate visually, while the charts could be larger and a bit more colorful."
2,"Ms. Peters is good, but that's about it","Bernadette does a spactacular job as Ruby. I am sorry to say that her fellow cast members do not match her. Do yourself a favor and buy the energy packed London Cast recording instead. No Bernadette, but the other cast members do a spactacular job. (Especially the actors who play Joan and Lucky.)"
1,Product did not work,"Product was a Christmas present and did not work, could not contact the place that it shouldve been returned to. The ""Dreamgear"" address did not exist as the paperwork was returned. Would not purchase this product or from this vendor again."
4,Musical Surprise,I was very pleased with the sound and quality of the recording. Surprised that the script before the songs were in it. The old LP was just the music. This was a nice way to refresh the memory of the show.
3,Not as bad as the guy below says,"This lathe isn't nearly as bad as the other reviewer says. I've had one for a couple years and have had no such problems. It is typical of the current generation of Chinese made power tools. Quite a bit of functionality for the money, but with some rough edges. This monster (for a home shop) costs less in constant dollars than an old Craftsman metal lathe did and could spin one of those with it's 4 jaw chuck."
2,Rambling and mediocre content,"Perhaps I was bitten by the high expectations for this book based on reading some of these glowing reviews. I've been working in and researching the Craft for quite a few years, and I've read my share of mediocre to excellent books. This really falls on the low end of that scale, unfortunately. I was turned off by the preachiness and repetitiveness of some of the text... the tone of the book was a bit much for my tastes. As I choose my next book, I'll make a point of skipping books by so-called 'mystics'. These days, everyone (apparently) is a mystic. I'd refer any interested readers to the comments by Harold Roth... his list is on target for excellence."
4,Specialized text does its job,"This book may be of little interest to philosophical ""tourists."" It comes at a time when many ""new age"" publications have proliferated to fill the desire for what one might call ""fluffy bunny paganism."" The pursuit of a pagan spiritual pathway necessarily plays out in the context of Christian domination and suppression of such expressions. This book addresses that history better than any other i have encountered to date. It provides valuable specifics about the worldview, spiritual challenges, benefits and ritual neccessities of ""earth based"" religious practice. As such, it is earthy and demanding in the level of dedication asked of adherents, ritual settings, and recognition of the spiritual entities in question. I would recommend it for those wishing to step beyond the comfortable level of dabbling in occult practice and into true spiritual dedication and union with ""the world below."""
3,3.5 stars--Hard to put down,"The Zozer Brotherhood is an ancient sect that is trying to regain power in modern times. Their goal is to put a pharoah back into power in Egypt and extend that power all over the world by pitting all the main religions violently against each other. Archaeologist Derek Loring becomes embroiled with the group along with Scotland Yard and MI6. This is a fast paced novel that keeps you reading. The action never slows up and the author does a good job of making you care about the characters. Being a first novel, the author has some things to work on, like scene transitions and dialog. Some of the dialog is very unbelievable. Even though the writing is not as eloquent as it could be, this is an impressive first novel because of the depth of the story and the fast pace."
4,Outstanding! A fast paced and engaging read.,The story and characters are all presented as very credible. Numerous and unexpected plot twists kept me riveted to the story.
4,What a powerhouse!,"I was able to see an advance showing of this wild movie at a Film Festival. It's a powerhouse all the way, beautifully directed and well acted. Talk about hard core excitement and quirky characters! This one has it all!"
1,Not the item I ordered.,What I received was not the item I ordered! I ordered 4 - 8 foot cables and got 2 - 6 foot ones and 2 - 7 foot ones. So I'm missing 6 foot of cable. I have also e-mailed them 2x's with no response. I would not order from them again.
3,Not Bad,"While the production of solid grooves and comlicated beats is the backbone of Tribal House, depite having a strong array of these structures throughout the album, most of it didn't seem that catchy. Peace Division has a strong delivery and each track is well formed, however a few are lengthy with little to no letting up on some very repetitive loops. I liked the album but it wasn't something I see myself coming back to frequently. The music is more danceable than it is listener or couch friendly. Despite being an absolute House junkie this one just didn't do it for me. I gave it three stars because it was merely ""so-so""."
1,Disappointed,This necklace is not worth the time or money. I lifted the necklace out of the box and the chain broke immediately. It is hard to appreciate a necklace if you never get to wear it. I wanted to give it no stars but you have to click a star to write a review.
1,"The ""story"" of the Allman Brothers Band","When reading Freeman's book, one must keep in mind the wording in the title, especially the word ""story."" Sadly, Freeman spent more time glorifying the problems of the band rather than focusing on what truly makes the band- their unique and wonderful style of music. Yes, the book is a fast and fascinating read, but like many unauthorized biographies and ""stories,"" Freeman should have investigated further before printing much information that was simply untrue. Freeman had the opportunity to write a great biography but just missed the mark in too many areas."
5,Very Real,"Scott Freeman gives a in depth portrait of one of most influential bands of the Classic Rock era. Most special is the description of Duane Allman's influence on the band. From reading this book, I realized that Duane was both a talented musician and a leader as he knew how to interact with every one of the band members including his sometimes irresponsible brother Gregg. It seems that after Duane died, the other band members carried on a piece of the legacy Duane created. However, each of these other band members has a special personality as well. There are some great stories interwoved in this book which are funny, sad, and historical in the shape of how blues rock music has evolved. Anyone who appreciates rock n roll music and even casually likes this band will find this book a winner."
2,Diamonds are of poor quality,"I guess you get what you pay for. The diamonds were discolored, some looked gray - almost black and if that was not bad enough some were severely scratched. I would have returned it but not worth the hassle. I gave it two stars because from FAR it actually looks OK but upon close examination you notice all the flaws."
4,An old favorite,"Mr. President came out in the early 60's. It's the fun story of a ficticious president and his family in the White House. The story is more fluff than meat, but I like several of Irving Berlin's songs, especially the duet, ""Empty Pockets Filled with Love."" I'm afraid, though, that only those who knew it when, and may have an old LP in their collection, would buy the CD now to upgrade their collection as I did. If you're into Broadway show music, you may want to give it a try."
3,One of those Columbia cast albums that make the show seem like a winner,"But...it's not. The score by Berlin is pleasant enough, but lacks a really dynamic song or two. Robert Ryan was a fine actor but a poor singer and his ""It Gets Lonely in the White House"" is quite painful.The original LP was packaged in a gatefold jacket with 4 pages of notes and pictures inside. The cover was a foil-like material that glittered.This CD edition was withdrawn a few years after it was released and is quite scarce. Maybe Sony will make it availble again as a download. It's not an essential cast album, and the show will never be revived, but it has enough of Berlin's old-fashioned melodies (and Nanette Fabray) to make it worthwhile.Update (March 2009): DRG has just reissued this title.Mr. President (1962 Original Broadway Cast) [CAST RECORDING] [ORIGINAL RECORDING REMASTERED]"
3,Good first half,"I finally was able to locate the CD of this show. The music from the first half the show has some verve and reflects the idea of the white house. ""They Loved Me"" is quite good with Nannete Fabray belting it out. And Anita Gillette's ""The Secret Service"" is amusing. But with the election having ended the rest of the show just peters out especially musically. The finale of ""This is a Great Country"" is typical Berlin patriotism, but it does not measure up to his other patriotic hymns. Robert Ryan's singing is not outstanding, but he does carry the tune and for collectors it is good to have his voice on a CD."
1,Shame on me,I don't know why I didn't look at the other reviews. My mistake. This three-stapled page 'book' is a complete waste of time and money. I don't even know why it's being offered here. Don't make the same mistake I made. Stay away!
4,PSI Woodworking D50C 4-Inch by 50-Feet Clear Flexible Dust Collection Hose,Very nice to work with. Plastic is fairly tough and resistant to puncture. Good to be able to see chips and dust flow and monitor clear paths.
4,Great value for the money,"I purchased this clear hose to connect my 24"" dual drum sander with my dust collection unit. The sander is on wheels (should I need to move it) so I didn't want a fixed pipe to the DC. The flexible hose is great. No ""chunks"" are going through it so I don't have to worry about a puncture. I do think the plastic is tough enough that I could use it for the planer or jointer if I needed to. All in all, a good choice for the application I used."
2,No Strength,"I did not realize how the black heavy duty piping worked so much better than this clear collector tubing. When you turn the vacumm on, this clear products gives under suction and jumps around. Spend a little more and get the heavy black 4 inch piping from this same company."
3,Too much internal resistance,"I bought this to use a 4 inch vacuum sweeper for my shop. I only needed 25 feet to reach the entire area, so I cut it in half. Hooked to a two horsepower dust collector, it has too much internal resistance to air flow to pick up anything more than sawdust. It won't pick up wood chips, or anything heavier."
5,Makes a great ferret run tube,"This isa nice heavy plastic tube. Is easily cut to lenght and its clear. Our ferrets love running through it.The best part is our ferrets dont rip holes in it as fast as the Marshalls super throughway. We have been looking for a tube like this for a long time.Thanks,Ron CrivelloGreater Chicago Ferret assocationBoard President[...]"
1,Thin thin plastic,By the time I hung the tubing I had 6 holes in it. Anything that touches it puts a hole in it. I would have been better off using paper. Bad bad investment I was so mad I ripped it down and chucked in the garbage. I have had my other pipe up for about 5 years bought it from Rockler thought I would redo everything and reroute a few things wrong. I do not recommend this product.
5,MOST RECOMMENDED,"I HAVE BOTH BLACK FLEX-HOSEJet JW1032 4-Inch x 20-Foot Black Dust Collection HoseAND CLEAR FLEX-HOSE.I LIKE THIS HOSE SO MUCH MORE. BEING ABLE TO SEE INTO THE HOSE PROVIDES REAL-TIME DIAGNOSTICS IF I AM EXPERIENCING A DROP IN SUCTION.THE HOSE IS WELL MADE, RUGGED, AND VERY FLEXIBLE."
4,"the ""Score""","America could wake up if every one read this book. This is what is going on everywhere [deep corruption]. We have lost our country to the USA corp and this book tells you who they are??? I have been searching for who is behind the Khemtrails, Rudy didn't know about the Khemtrails. Parts 2 and 3 are essential reading for all Americans who are really Americans. This book is the 'key' to who they are??? Read this book and inform others, all leaders and talk radio hosts should check the contents out... the international bankers are Americas worst night mare!!! Sagebrush of Montana"
4,"Author may be an ..., but good book","Rudy ""Butch"" Stanko owned the Cattle King Beef Co., one of the largest meat packers in America. It grossed over 200 million dollars in one year.Unfortunately for him, he was in an industry that was considered by the Jews to be reserved for themselves. With the cooperation of the press, they brought criminal charges against him, convicted him, and put him out of business.Included are lengthy appendices on Zionism, the Sanhedrin, the Kehillah and the protocols of Zion."
1,Note: NOT as described,"The Giottos bag is well made, but padding is fairly thin. Notably, the dimensions given are wrong. The interior width is no more than 4.5"" not 7.5"" as claimed. I wanted/needed a bag much closer to 7.5""."
1,"Poor audio quality, uncomfortable","I was very disappointed with this product. The wire includes a volume/mute control. I don't know if mine is defective, but I can only hear at a reasonable level when both the phone and headset volume are set to max. By contract, with my Jabra C500 I keep the phone volume at 3 (out of 8). Also, the ""under-the-ear"" design and swivel earpiece aren't that comfortable. I've owned several other ""over-the-ear"" designs with earpiece gels that are much more comfortable for long term wear. Plus, this headset it a _lot_ pricier."
4,"Once used to it, works well","I was looking for an ear piece to replace my over-the-head set (which made my hair look funny by the end of the day). I tried a few other products but this one has been the most comfortable AND my customers can hear me speaking and this unit offers great volume control.It took me several days to get used to putting ear piece on - and I generally take off/on many times in a day.One other item I tried had a stretchy cord from phone to ear, which was fabulous for extra length. This one is a bit short for my preferences, but I would buy again."
5,"excellent political intrigue story from cook, 4 1/2 stars","This book is somewhat unique in the books I have read by glen cook. While there are military elements present they are secondary to the story and battles do not play a notable role. The political intrigue, a story of 3 factions interested in control of the city, as well as the goals of the Witch and the infighting in 2 of the factions, one of which at least superficially resembles imperial rome. More generally this book appears to be well informed by classical studies in general and in one particular case it is hard not to think of a certain event in the Punic Wars.Realistic portrayal of characters, believable political goals and machinations, and sympathetic characters from most sides make this a pleasure to read. If you enjoyed The Dragon Never Sleeps or Shadowline, the political violence will seem more muted here but the tapestry he weaves is arguably more complex."
4,One of Glen Cook's better Books,"Glen Cook writes an exceptional book. There are three main factions, all vying for a ""win"" in a great and fading city. The wins are mutually exclusive. Each faction is led by a smart, capable leader who has tactical and stratigic goals. Each has motivations that are both clear and obscure. This is a book about smart people competing against each other and dealing with unexpected events, bad luck, and people showing human failings and insights. There are very realistic portrayals of cpeople and I came to care for many of the characters. Balance this story against books where the hero comes up with a plan, competes against powerful but incompetent advesaries, and chugs toward a successful conclusion.Power is balanced with flaws, cunning against bad luck, morality against emotional weakness.I am a Cook fan and this was one of his best books. Highly recommended. [Best was probably The Dragon Never Sleeps- space opera.]"
4,Totally New Fantasy Fiction,"Cook has the ability to wright in a way that few others do. His plot twists in this book are particularly indepth. He creates a new world, completly diffrent from most fantasy fiction novels, it is a kind of Lorance of Arabia meets the Black Company. Cook takes a personl approach to the characters which makes the reader become more involved. The book is not the best Cook has ever written but it ranks up there (maybe the best story line). The book is a great read with several diffrent plot lines, a must for the Glenn Cook fan."
1,Not Like Garret PI series,I am a huge fan of Glen Cook's Garrett PI stories. I really disliked Tower of Fear because it tried to tell about the adventure from several protagonist viewpoints. It's almost like he's trying to write an episode of the world he portrays as opposed to one person's adventure. It does add a lot of pages to the book if he is being paid by page.
2,A Waste,"This DVD is not nesecary for anyone to watch. 90% of the DVD revolves around 9/11, and only the remaining 10% is how the Pentagon, and the Armed Services work. Very little (10 minutes) is spent focusing on new technology that will be availible in the future.Of the 90% talking about 9/11, 75% is propoganda for the ""war on terror."" If we want propoganda, we can turn on the television and watch it for free, not pay for a DVD or a DVD rental. The 15% reolving around 9/11 that is not propoganda, it talks about how the attacks effected the Pentagon, and how it all worked before, and after.This is a waste of money, the only good part is the 10% talking about how the Pentagon & the Armed Services for in conjuction with each other. There is an interesting piece on the coast guard, however, that merely falls on the borderline between interesting information, and propoganda."
4,Pentagon,"Being in the military and conducting work for the Pentagon I just had to have this dvd. It is very informative though of course you miss out still on a lot of things since they can't be released to the public. Anyway, For an educational film it was pretty good though as mentioned don't expect to much detail in what is actually done there."
4,Film Review,"It had some interesting parts and ""gee whiz"" types of information, but for the most part it was repetitive and had a tendency to drag."
2,Krusell Makes a Solid Product,"UPDATE: Product has failed. The so-called lifetime warranty is worthless without the item code. Item code is on the original packaging. Their customer service will not help, because they do not want to honor the warranty.ORIGINAL: I bought this case because of the price. I will buy another Krusell because of the quality. Krusell has a unique feature that enables the clip to be replaced. They offer different types of clips to suit anyone's desire. On the rare occassion a Krusell clip breaks, it is easy to replace.The case is also very rugged. There is sufficient padding in the case to protect the phone when I drop the case with the phone inside. It also looks better than it did in the picture on Amazon.I had a very bad experience with Krussel customer service. I lowered my rating."
4,Music to burn monasteries to!,"This is a great album for any fan of classical/power metal. The title track, ""The Last Viking,"" is definitely one of the best songs on the album. ""Forest Song,"" ""Winter Battle,"" and ""Alone"" are also excellent. As the reviewer before me stated, the emphasis is on keyboard music, which is blended together beautifully with the guitar music, and the vocals are right-on. Definitely pick this one up, Vikings!"
4,I disagree,"Actualy, I disagree with the previous reviewer that the guitar work was dissapointing. The intent of this album was to showcase the keyboards over the guitarrist. I think that the sound of the album was superb with Jens shwcasing why he is the best keyboardist of this generation. Sometimes I thought I was listening to JS Bach playing shred neoclassical metal. Goran delivers solid vocals. I was expecting more trade off solos between Jens and Michael but with Jens soloing alone is well worth it.[...]"
3,Good Book,Good book but don't expect too muchband insight on song meanings.Mostly speculation by the author.
4,good machine for the price!!,We use this model in our production plant drilling ductile .We have had 2 drills on line for a year with no problem.This model is 110-220-or 440 volt hooking up 440 helps us with elect bills.
4,Recommended,"From Richard Feynman, with love. Need more to be said? Read it, and read it again. This one can be read all over again once in a while and does not get boring."
2,The Hawaiian Archipelago--Incomplete Free book,"I also downloaded the free book and was dismayed to find it was not the complete edition. It was not stated this is only a excerpt. I certainly would have purchased the entire volume, and will do so when I finish my current book, also by Isabella Bird. She is a fascinating author and very insightful. I really recommend A Lady's Life in the Rocky Mountains."
5,a must for travelers to the big island,"I was on the big island on 11/11/11 and now it is almost 12/12/12. I unknowingly went to many of the places ILB went. It's both a travel guide, history lesson and reference guide. It should be a movie."
3,"Good music,but doesn't play on all players","It's A Bird ... It's A Plane ... It's Superman (1966 Original Broadway Cast)I like the CD, but it doesn't play on all CD players. Printed information in the CD case seems to be for the cassette version. People with older or fussier CD players may want to be aware of possible problems."
4,Excellent book for road trips!,"This book gives you information about many Arizona towns and cities. What I liked is that Mr. Trimble explains the history of the towns, even those small ones in the middle of nowhere. He explains who founded the towns, how and why, and gives you the background on the people involved. Mr. Trimble's writing style is humorous, easy to read, and fun! This book is a must for anyone traveling Arizona's roads!"
1,Grand Canyon section filled with inaccuracies,"I don't know about the rest of the book, but almost every paragraph on Grand Canyon has an inaccurate statement and he had NO canyon reference in the bibliography. I wrote Mr. Trimble and he stated ""Everyone interprets history differently"". Not well established dates. Therefore, I don't trust the accuracy in the rest of the book and do NOT recommend this publication. NATIVE ROADS is a MUCH better book!"
5,Excelent movie,A movie that make you think whats really important in our lives. I recommended!!Great actors!!! movie for all ages
1,Not worth the $$$,I was temp. insane and bought this and the matching shampoo which was $$$$. Didn't see any difference in my hair and this conditioner is def. not moisturizing enough. My hair was a knotted mess after my shower. Do yourself a favor and save your $$$.
2,Lennox disappointingly unfocused throughout,"Although I greatly appreciated the ""conversation"" aspect of this debate as opposed to the formal, dual-lectern format of these two mens' earlier ""God Delusion Debate"", both men kind of stayed too much in their own worlds for my taste. John talked about his faith, but really didn't DEBATE at the level he had done in the God Delusion debate. I felt he really and truly won that debate, but this debate was a zero for both men, in my opinion. Dawkins' statements kept failing by their own contradictions as usual, and Lennox just kind of sat there, trying to think of the next words in his sentences. I found this debate surprisingly boring after the excitement of the earlier debate. Dawkins was very on his game mentally (not to say intellectually), but Lennox was in a fog."
1,"If You Purchase theBoom, Consider It A Donation That's Not Tax Deductible","I'm having problems with my current headset, and was looking around for a new option. I got a chuckle when I ran across this one again. I purchased one of theBoom headsets some time back. The ear clip broke in less than a year, and I could not get them to respond when using their website. Needless to say, it quickly found its way to the trash, and I learned my lesson. theBoom is a bust!"
1,Poor Product Description,"The description said lid for 18"" wok. Does it fit my 18"" wok? It depends on how you define 'fit'. This cover is 16"" in diameter which indeed does 'fit' in my 18"" wok. Only catch is it sinks all the way down into my 18"" wok. My 18"" wok has a 5.5"" depth from bottom to top and now with this lid it will be down to only 3"".I think the problem is they make lids in the exact same size of woks, 18"" 16"" 14""... First they shipped 18"" lids for 18"" woks and people immediately figured those lids would be touching the edge of the woks. Now they ship one size smaller which unfortunately becomes too small. They should make a 17.5"" or 17"" lid for a 18"" wok."
1,Skip this book if you are a Destroyer Fan,"Remo goes out at night looking for some people to beat up. Not the Master Assassin we have come to know and love.Remo is also making basic mistakes and Chiun wants to take him back to the beginning. The writer forgets that he is a Master now, not some beginner. He swims a whole 100 meters underwater, in earlier books it was miles, etc., etc., etc.Mistake after mistake as this non Destroyer author takes apart the basis of all of the characters in the book.You will read about roundhouse kicks and other basic Karate moves instead of Sinanju. Like books #108 and #109 somehow Remo has turned into a non weapon version of Mack Bolan. Not a book for Destroyer lovers, even Smith is not his usual self."
3,a lesson to be learned,"this book, like the past three should serve as reminders to the loyal fans of the destroyer series, that we should never take the continuity and the writing for granted. we should ever be on guard in the future to prevent such tragedies from ever happening again. there is a lesson to be learned from all of this"
1,could not go lower than one star.,This was a total waste of time. I found I had to force myself to finish it. Not worth the paper it was printed on.
2,It always had been about the relationship,"The two aspects of the Destroyer series that have brought me back without fail through 110 tales of their adventures are the relationship between Chiun and Remo and the irreverant manner with which current social issues and icons are dealt. This offering has diappointingly little of these two elements. As a result, it ranks as one of my least favorite. I can only hope (as does an addict looking for his next fix) that future tales bring back the Remo and Chiun I have come to love."
1,The last of a three issue blunder in an otherwise excellent,"Mike Newton again attempts to change Remo's last name to Bolanas the Executioner guest stars in yet another Destroyer. Newton isalright in the Executioner, but THIS IS NOT THE EXECUTIONER! Reality will resume next issue when a more reliable author takes over ghosting reigns on the series. Keep this book along with 108 and 109 if you dared purchase them as classic examples of what NOT to do with the Destroyer."
5,This book is a MUST,"I took this book on my first and only trip to Venice and began my first day with it. Standing in St. Mark's Square a man came up to me and asked me how I was enjoying the book and I said that I was just beginning on my first walk. He smiled and pointed to the author's photo on the back of the book and said he was glad to see me venturing out with the book. It was the author! As I stood there stammering he melted into the crowd. This book tells you each and every wee turn you must take, which way turn after crossing which small bridge and takes you the most amazing places. I think this is out of print, but pay what you must for it if you are going to Venice and you will not be disappointed- and that is a promise."
4,Cf. the advanced search options,"A pretty, visual book. Each page has full colour screen shots of Google's pages. You might wonder at first, why? Don't you just use its main page? Well, that is the very point of this book. O'Hara shows how you can gain far more from Google.For example, the Directory Pages gives a top down format for data searching that mimics Yahoo's directories, that originally shot Yahoo to fame on the Internet.Plus, there is Google news. These are near real time news feeds from news organisations all over the world. Its greatest merit may be to expose you to alternative viewpoints; instead of just your regular newspapers.But potentially the most useful portion of the book concerns the advanced search options. Many never avail themselves of these. Which is a pity. The book shows a good understanding can be a tremendous force multiplier to your web searching. Well worth spending some time getting acquainted and facile with these options."
4,Excellent advice on real world issues with CMMI,"This book assumes some previous knowledge on the CMMI model, the author does a great job at showing real business situations and identifies them with issues related to people, behavior, management and technical that can affect your process improvement effort or initiative. It has a very practical approach, the reader will get good advice on what approaches, techniques, attitudes are really effective.They could have put an appendix showing the various CMMI process areas for those readers not so familiar with the model, aside from that I consider it a must read for anyone in any area related to process improvement be it CMMI, Six Sigma, etc."
3,$50 BUCKS?!,"I'm a Mustang freak with a 16-month old, so this was a must-have this Christmas. But I can't for the life of me figure out why it's $50. It doesn't make any sounds or play any music, and it's not radio controlled.Check your local KB*Toys; it's $15 there."
4,My continued exploration into Assemblage 23....,This is the 'Ground' EP consisting of 5 tracks; 2 B-sides 'Consequence' and 'Lament' which were actually strong songs in their own right. The song 'Ground' takes up the other 3 slots. The first track is the amazing album version of the song and track 3 and 5 are mixes. I enjoyed the 2 B-side songs and Tom Shear has created his own signature sound for 'Assemblage 23'. Track 3 is Ground in a more darker version reminiscent of Delerium's 'Euphoric'. Track 5 is the Acoustic version of 'Ground' and is a must listen too and my pick for the best song on this EP. This CD is a must for any industrial fan or any electronica fan.
3,poor shipping,I had to pay additional postage and drive to the post office to retrieve it because of that. But it was packaged safely.Item is what it says (360 degree six inch goniometer) and durable.I would have prefered a 1=200 map scale rather than a ruler.
2,NOT VERY GOOD IF ACCURACY IS IMPORTANT,"The machine was very well packed and easy to assemble right out of the box. It lacks a spindle lock. The chuck was a little out of round. When you chuck a bit and turn it on, the bit runs fairly true with the quill fully retracted, but when extended about half way or more it begins to wobble. When fully extended I measured a full 1/16"" of wobble in all directions. You can turn it off and extend the quill and move it that same amount by hand. The spindle and quill must have some pretty sloppy tolerances. I will be returning this press."
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this Jet Drill Press to replace my old, once reliable, Sears 14"" Craftsman.The several positive reviews regarding it's accuracy have not helped the performance of this drill press. I have tried to correct the chuck from it's slight wobble/vibration, but it continues to be unsatisfactory. For me, it is a frustration and a waste of time and money. (In retrospect, I should have opted for the General...which is still a possibility if I can sell my wife on it!)It must be too much to expect for the machine to run properly and hassle-free, out of the box.I generousely gave it one star because it is a ""quiet"" disappointment!"
3,"not pleased, but can live with it","I was not able to finish the assembly do to a very warped rack. To cranck the table up or down is near impossible.The rack has a very notice bow to it, and would in no time destory the gear that rides in it.I am pleased to say after calling jet, that I recieved the parts needed to do the repairs very quickly. in fact they sent far more parts than I had requested."
2,Very Disapointed!,"I purchased the Jet Drill Press from a local dealer and within the first month the metal bar on the side that allows you to move the table up and down bent very badly. When I went back to the dealer, they told me to lay the machine down on the ground on it's side and bend the part back. Well of course I cannot do this, at 5'4"" and 120 pounds I could not possibly move the heavy drill press around top lay it down. Plus after spending over $400.00 including tax, I would expect a replacement. I was very very disapointed and I have decided against investing in the Jet Jointer and will go with the Delta model. Although I will say I do like my Jet supersaw very much. I would be leary of any Jet product as I have found it impossible to get any service center to come out to work on them."
4,"Solid, Easy to use","Putting this together was easy and quick. Instructions were thorough. It is heavy and a solid machine and takes no time at all to change the speeds, and the drilling is sure and true. But it does shake and rattle a bit more than I would like, and I couldn't get the depth stop to be perfectly lined up with the scale (which means if I want to drill 2"" I have to set the depth stop to 1 7/8"" to compensate). The beefyness, and accuracy of the drilling make this a good buy for sure."
4,JET JDP-17mf drill press,"If you are looking for a quality built floor standing drill press at a reasonable cost, look to JET's JDP-17MF. I could not be more pleased with mine. The shipping carton and receipt condition was excellent. The look, feel, and fit of the assembled tool is everything I expected. The operation of the tool with its sixteen speeds from 200 to 3630 rpm provides a wide range of speeds, so you can match the drilling speed to the job at hand. The JDP-17MF has a large table, which is easly lowered or raised to the perfect working height. The tool is massive, weighing in at almost 200 pounds. The motor runs smooth and quiet, and thanks to JET outfitting the tool with a three quarter horse power 110/220 V a.c. motor, you'll make fast work of drilling holes in all kinds ofmaterials. ... ..."
4,Great Drill Press - Amazon Stinks Though,This drill press is very nice. The description isn't as thorough as it could be on the site. It has plenty of speeds and the quality of the work that comes off of it is very nice.Be careful when ordering. Amazon claims free shipping and in stock. I had to wait 2 weeks - and they charged me an addl. $9.95 for shipping. Wouldn't have been a big deal except I needed it for business. And they strung me along week by week instead of being up front about the delay.Also having the same shipping and availability problems with a bandsaw I ordered from Amazon that same day. Had to cancel and order from a different supplier.
4,Good Drill Press For The Money,I just received my Jet 16 1/2 drill press from the tool crib last week. Set-up was very easy and it was up and running in less than an hour. Overall fit and finish was very good. I recommend everyone pay the extra $25 bucks for FED EX. They took it off the truck and put it in the garage for me. Well worth it.
4,i got my jet drill press,"it came by fed-ex friday 9/14 it was in good shape,i had it together in about 20 minutes,the head was alittle heavy but i got it ok,checked it out and it ran fine,then i had to leave for work,it did have a little vibration,but i think some better belts will help,im going to try the fenner power twist link belts later but im going to give it time to break in,i like the light fixture in it,i really think its ok so far,will let you know if i have problems with it,thanks tool crib,and fed-ex"
3,DIsappointing,"If you love the book ""A Tree Grows In Brooklyn,"" prepared to be disappointed with the 1951 musical. The core of the book is the story of a young girl's coming of age. Young Francie is, without doubt, the novel's protagonist. The musical, and the music numbers on the cast recording, focus instead on the various adult love stories (namely, that between Francie's mother and father, a ne'er-do-well Irish tenor, and the various romances of Francie's aunt Sissy). So you end up with the usual Broadway array of love stories, only one -- ""Make the Man Love Me"" -- particularly memorable. The unique perspective of the novel is utterly lost.I am a fan of classic Broadway musicals (especially from the 40s, 50s, and 60s) and often buy original cast recording CDs of them. This one just does not impress me as a keeper."
4,"A Little Hoaky, but Shirley Booth is in it","I have had this recording in my collection since it was a 45 rpm album. Shirley Booth always delights especially in the number Love is the Reason. Look Who's Dancing is another upbeat number. The music is rather schmaltzy by Arthur Schwartz, but it evokes another time when musicals were to be melodic. While the show itself may not be outstanding by today's standards, the songs are memorable."
3,Very happy,Purchased this as a gift and it arrived faster than I had expect. I am very pleased with their service.
4,A Must-Have for Bills fans,"All I can say is that I am one proud Bills fan after watching this DVD! I would recommend it for anyone who calls themself a fan...It's certainly not easy to capture a team's 50 year history in only 1 hr and 45 minutes but this release is solid. You'll learn not just about the team, but which players & coaches were most beloved by Bills fans and the city of Buffalo. I've only had the chance to watch the main documentary so far, but that alone is worth buying this DVD for!"
5,If your husband or you are a Buffalo Bills fan.......,I bought this set for my husband for Christmas last year and he just loves it. He sat on the couch and teared up over certain parts of it. He was very appreciative of it. The service was great - it arrived a day early even so close to Christmas! Thank you Amazon!
5,dry skin much better,i have used this shampoo and conditioner on my dog for years. works very well on his dry skin! smells pretty good too.
5,Best Product we have found!,"No anti-itch shampoo for pets is perfect. Let's face it...dry skin is not going to be solved with an occasional shampoo...but this is the best we have found so far, and we have tried many."
3,For the Guns aficionado,"As a huge Guns fan who grew up just a little too late to really appreciate the music as it was happening. I will devour anything I can get my hands on about the infamous Guns n Roses. Though its a little short and does not cover every detail about the formation and downfall of a great band it does give you details others do not. It paints a detailed picture of what was happening with Slash, Duff and Axl at a specific point. I think a lot of it only really made sense because I have read so many other works about the band. But with out that prior knowledge its still a good read for a casual Guns fan or someone just getting into them."
3,Who's Telling the TRUTH?,"I've read the book and many of the stories in there are quite amusing. The only thing about it is that Axl goes off on Mick Wall at Kerrang, in the song ""Get in the Ring"" So who is telling the truth. Are these stories real or made up just to make the book more intersting? anyway it is still worth the read if your a fan.(GNR Rocks and Axl is a GOD!)"
4,Wow!,"Some of the styles in this book were obviously western-inspired, with their own twist. Very amusing book, although it could have done with some background info."
5,The Kingdom of God is near,"What a phenomenal movie! It is not comfortable or easy, but I like to believe Jesus wrote this parable for us today. I got to watch this with my Dad who was dying and we had a conversation that will never leave me. Don't wait for a discount version - invest your heart in this now. I won't give it away, but let's just say it makes you believe God does redeem in our lifetime, and salvation is more than a promise on the future - it is a way of life."
4,A Sometime Read,"This was a very good book to read. No, a great book to read! But, sets up a bunch of problems at work. Very good book to read and have in the back of your mind, but take with a grain of salt. Was written a long time ago, so don't read into it too much. Some of the earlier chapters are somewhat offensive."
5,Things My Father Always Told Me,"In the interest of helping out his daughter the best he could, my father ""educated"" me on the strategies and thinking of men (including himself) in the business world and in general. I found this book to be amazingly close to what he had always told me and right on with my own experiences. I imagine it to be a real eye opener for those girls who didn't have the type of honest father that I did. If a woman reads this book and says to herself, ""Yeah right! That can't be so,"" I would venture to guess that they didn't, and that they should take this book very seriously. If a man reads it and says, ""That doesn't really happen,"" he's not in touch with reality."
4,A surprisingly nice treat,"I just happened to grab this book without having read any reviews, as I had about two minutes before the library was closing and my twins tugging on my sleeves to go get a DVD. What a lovely treat I was in store for.I liked the way the author demonstrated, through the eyes of these children, some universal truths we've all experienced to some extent. He depicts the vulnerability and isolation each child faces (and which all of us are subject to at one time or another), accompanied by some person reaching into their lives in an unexpected way. In a similar way, through the eyes of children, we see how our preconceived ideas of others often fail to show us the true character of who that person is beneath outward appearances.Wonderfully written, most enjoyable. Characters are beautifully constructed. Most will wish the story were longer and more developed in overall plot, but as a glimpse into this family's lives (and even into ourselves in some ways) it is a rich read."
3,Rich atmosphere; reads more like short stories than a novel.,"This better-tahn-average work of literary fiction is quite enjoyable to read - well-written and richly evocative of the 1940s. The characters are children of Chinese descent growing up in Vancouver's Chinatown, and the first-person sections are written in the voices of three of them, all of whom are having some trouble finding their way in a world where the old certainties of centuries of Chinese life seem not always to apply. I enjoyed the book, but was left wanting something more - the chapters of each section seemed more like short stories, sketches of individual moments in which someone's life changed, rather than a novel. They are excellent stories, and they are interconnected, but rather loosely."
4,My thoughts!,"Great Product, Like Playtex usually offers, this particular model was a bit smaller than my usual Playtex brand in the 42C size, but still fits good and has excellant support!"
5,Best Bra Ever!,"If your ""big girls"" need a lift, this is the bra for you. No more hanging low or spreading out! I love the feel and fit and almost forget I'm wearing a bra, even at the end of a long day. The padded straps prevent shoulder ridges. The under-band stays in place and does not ride up. The cups are seam-free, full, and pretty, and they give you that youthful, smooth look. I wash my bras in the machine, but hang them to dry naturally. The shape remains. I would highly recommend this Playtex bra and I wish it came in black as well as white and beige. Lovely undergarment, for sure."
2,Would not purchase again,"Fits okay, but not great. It's kind of scratchy, but I guess that's because of the lacey parts of it. I will not wear it if I know it is going to be a long day because it is just not very comfortable after too long. I would not buy another one of these."
5,love these,"I just love the way this bra feels. But do not make the mistake in washing them in hot water over and over again, because the elastic seems to always get out of shape. If they could come up with a bra that can be washed in hot and remain in shape, that would be a great bra."
5,18 hour Bra #4395 Review,So glad I found this product on your site. I have been searching for this product in stores to no avail. It is an excellent product and I hope that you continue to offer it.
2,Playtex,"This bra is a little too ""pointy"" & it doesn't fit true to size. It feels stiff & itchy. I might buy it again if I could try it on first."
1,Madonna Bra,"This bra is a BIG disappointment of any Playtex bra I have ever bought. Very stiff, fit true to size.... If you like to have cone shaped breast, this is the bra for you. Personally I do not like pointy breast....."
4,"Great support, but makes boobs pointy","From crazzeto's wife:The first thing I noticed about this bra was that the material was not the soft cotton blend I'm used to, but some sort of strange plastic-y feeling stuff. I thought it would feel awful against my skin but I actually got used to it very quickly. I also noticed that it was extremely tight. I suppose it helps with support, but I could hardly fasten it and the straps dug into my shoulders! I also couldn't adjust the straps much at all. The worst part about this bra, though, it that it makes my boobs VERY pointy and makes them point outwards towards my shoulders like some sort of Madonna costume. It also made my breasts look smaller. I am keeping it only because it is so dang hard to find a bra in my size."
2,Disappointed,Cup size and band size not accurate. I had myself measured several times before ordering. Very disappointed that had to send back. Normally love Playtex products.
3,Playtes bras,"The bras are not the quality they use to be. The material starts looking worn after just a few washings., and that is hand washed."
2,Bad design,"While this bra is comfortable, the cup design is unnatural looking. It is very pointed rather than a natural rounded profile. I was very disappointed."
2,Poor shape,"I was disappointed with this bra. it was more cone shaped than dome shaped, which is not the shape I'm looking for in a bra. I have returned this purchase."
3,Pretty but cheap,"The ring looks great!It's light and has smooth corners.Unfortunately, it falls apart easily. If you knock the stone top once against a chair, the cameo top and the bottom will become unglued.Because it is cheaply put together, don't expect to keep this ring together for long. Mine fell apart the first night I wore it.But, for the time you will wear it, it will look very nice."
4,my credit card and chargest,i would have wanted to know if my credit card would be safe to ernter to you and it wouldnt be any future charges coming toward me for other items i did not order or that you are trying to sell.this were a hardf cd to fine and i found it on amazon mostly the other onei i'll play the blues for you.
5,Surprisingly Great,"For these tourists stranded in a desert village, staging an amateur production of ""King Lear"" is a very minor platform to expose their emotional desperation. A lesser film would have made it all about the play. This one realizes that each human loses civility or sanity at his or her own unique pace that doesn't require a ""leader"" or ""followers."" There is no detail here that reminds me of any other movie or book, which is quite amazing considering the subject."
5,wonderful travel video,Not only is the video informative it is also very entertaining. I like to travel and I am looking forward to more titles from Travel Delight Media.
4,Italian Intermezzo - A memory of times past,This is a wonderful example of old-time Italian songs. The guitar is played like a mandolin and the clarinet and accordion add to the wonderful sound evoking images of Italian immigrants sitting around playing their music.
2,"Thought it was a good shoe, but...","The shoes fit great and were very comfortable for about 2 weeks. Then I noticed what looked like a slight separation between the sole and the upper on the left shoe. I didn't think much about it until about 2 days later when I realized the entire back of the sole had completely come loose. So much for these sneakers.Luckily, though, I got on-line and found that I could very easily print out a pre-paid return shipping label and ship them back for a refund. No problem, I'm just glad they fell apart when they did. No, I'm not going to try for another pair, just a refund. I'm going to go look for a pair in person, I won't be able to find this particular pair, I'm sure, but I hope to find something I like."
3,Easy Sprirt Women's Medley Walking Shoe,"My mother (whom I ordered this for) found the shoes to be too tight when she put in on to try out. It seems that nothing seems to be a match for for old Naturalizer shoes (which were purchased back in 2004 and the style is no longer available today), however, this was as close as I could find to what shw has now."
1,Very Disappointed,"I was excited when I bought these shoes--I have a very narrow foot and was happy to finally find narrow walking shoes. However, my excitement quickly turned to dismay: after using these shoes for less than a month (and using them GENTLY), one shoe's rubber sole (the upper part of it) has peeled apart from the toe. Now I get a wet foot if I venture into soggy grass while walking. Thanks, Easy Spirit. I waited several years to buy a new pair of walking shoes and this is what I got. whoopee."
2,poorly made shoe,"I bought this shoe 3 months ago. It is already falling apart!! The rubber sole is torn off to the middle of the shoe and the sole near the toes is also pulling off. I thought Easyspirit shoes had good arch support, that's why I bought them, but the arch support isn't very good. I am returning them and won't buy another pair. Now, I can't say that I'll buy anything from easyspirit!!!"
5,Medley is a winner,This is a nice soft comfortable shoe that is light weight and looks trim. It is safer than those big clunky athletic shoes that can easily trip you up walking across a rug. Also the sole does not lend itself to getting packed with dirt or mud that is difficult to get out.
3,Comfortable but workmanship not good,I am on my third pair of these shoes. I love that there are no seams over the little toe area to hurt my toes. They are extremely comfortable BUT they only last about 3 months only being worn for walking once or twice a week. The rubber sole on the side pulls away from the shoe. The shoes are like new except for that. I would like for them to find a way to improve the workmanship. I continue to buy them for the comfort but am disappointed otherwise.
2,Little support for walking,I bought 2 pair of Easy Spirit Walking Shoes over the internet. I have a very narrow foot so I have a hard time finding shoes. This shoe is attractive but supplies very little support if you are a serious walker and have trouble with you feet. Both shoes are setting in the closet not being used.
4,Great Shoe,"Had this shoe for work and wore them almost every day for at least a year. Comfortable and worked well for Summer especially. Before purchasing the Easy Spirit, I used to wear only Rockport for work but wasn't able to find them anymore so bought this Easy Spirit instead. This shoe didn't wear as long as my Rockports did, but I knew I needed to find them again. When I couldn't find this Easy Spirit style in the store, I was glad to find them on Amazon. I am on my feet all day doing patient care. Would recommend them for anyone looking for a comfortable everyday shoe."
3,A worthy effort,"If this is the only way some people will hear Handel's Messiah, then that's not a bad thing. I can appreciate a range of music, and I enjoy the upbeat style this version attempted. And sometimes the solos appeal to me more than the traditional ones. I am not a fan of electric guitar, however, and there are a few electric guitar excursions. Also, the trumpet song is entertaining in its own way, but seems out of step with the more reverent tone of the rest of the songs. I like the narrator Barry McGuire a lot in a more casual setting, but here he doesn't always seem a good fit and a couple times sounds too much like a TV preacher. Still, several songs are good enough, and some have an interesting, haunting wood-knock sound. ""He shall feed his flock"" (Walsh/Taff) and especially ""Behold the Lamb of God"" (Herring) touch the soul."
1,The lights in Westminster Abbey...,"...are powered by Handel spinning in his grave.My uncle, a semi-professional opera singer, introduced me to this monstrosity years ago. He had something better than the CD - he had a videotape of the performances. And oh my, were they bad. They were so bad, they actually wrapped all the way back around to funny.This album suffers from the worst flaws of ""contemporary Christian"" music. Off-key soloists. Strange instrumentations. Soulless, metronomic rhythms. Weird phrasings (""Eh-heh-VREE va-ha-LEE""). And earnestness that makes your teeth hurt.The capper was the repeated insistence by the performers that this was exactly the way Handel would have done things if he had access to modern instruments. EXACTLY.With so many fine recordings of ""The Messiah"" available, why on earth would you choose this one?"
2,"Some good bits, but dated now","This is one of several 're-workings' of Handel's immortal oratorio 'Messiah', but it is by no means the best (for that you should try 'Handel's Messiah: A Soulful Celebration'). The Phil Driscoll version of ""The Trumpet Shall Sound"" is impressive, if a little over the top, but many of the other tracks have not stood the test of time and sound like they're stuck in the 80s (ie. over-synthed and too many filters).However, it is pleasing to see popular musicians tackling this great work - after all, Handel wanted it to be relevant to the times, and he gave permission for it to be adapted so that it would always be popular. Now, how many composers have ever given licence like that??"
1,"Tight, Very Tight on your head",Unless you have child's size head do not buy this. It is extremely tight on my face. No way to loosen it either.
2,Tepid and Discouraging,"I've read this book a number of time with my daughter. The odd premise is that we are all alike despite our differences. The main character, April, encounters people who are different races or ethnicities, people with disabilities, even boys and men, and . . .nothing much happens.She has these encounters before and during a weekend train trip to visit her Grandmother. (Oddly, nothing is made of how older people are different but the same.) Her Grandmother cuts a bunch of different flowers and gives April the bouquet.This aggregation of flowers symbolizes, one must suppose, that different people can be in the same place. Gosh!The story is weak, the premise flimsy, but the illustrations are OK."
5,A rare treat,"This book is such a rare treat as it shows us differences in people through the eyes of a child who accepts those differences as unique and important contributions to the whole of mankind.The illustrations are glorious and bring out the beauty of loving each other for what we are and what we have to contribute; not for what we might appear to be. I especially liked the lesson of not having to choose between what we liked as the ""best"", or ""better than"".My three children and I thank the author/illustrator for this wonderful gift."
4,Great book for all kids,"This book shows the girl seeing people of all differences: Blind people, adult people, fat people, disabled people, asian people, pregnant people and how they are all beautiful. Great for the classroom and great for the grandkids"
3,Good Moral - Story is Lacking,"This book does teach a great lesson, but the storyline is a little dull and a bit wordy for the younger crowd. May lose interest before they get to the point of the story!"
5,Celebrating Diversity,"I found ""Different Just Like Me"" to be a positive, uplifting book that celebrates diversity in the human race. It is something that we should not be ashamed of but proud of because it makes living in this world so fascinating and interesting. It is an excellent book to read and discuss with young children for they will be the leaders of tomorrow and will need the tools and knowledge to have tolerance and understanding for all people in order to make this world a better place to live. Ms. Mitchell's book definitely gives children an opportunity to explore and celebrate diversity now and hopefully into adulthood. It is a must for teachers of young children. Also, the illustrations are beautiful!"
2,The filter is really not worth buying,"it filters the water pretty good, filter less quantity each time due to spce limit, and it quiet slow filter.not consumer friendly"
2,"Practical size, but flimsy,leaky top","The good: fits is small places, slim line. Pretty easy to carry. Reasonably economical, and good tasting water from the filter.The bad: Very flimsy top. It usually leaks water you you pour it, even using a hand to hold the top in place while holding the pitcher handle with the other hand .If you pour with one hand, expect a puddle of water.And more leaking when you refill it.So in all, the water is good and inexpensive (and thus a lot better than wasteful, planet-damaging oil-intensive bottled water), but the product design is pretty poor."
2,Any slimmer and it wouldn't hold water,"I like Brita. I own a full-size pitcher, which I use daily at home.I bought the Brita Slim Pitcher for my office to use in a Sanyo SR-3770S Counter-High Refrigerator (great product, see my review). The pitcher fits tightly in the door, but there's so little usable space that I'm refilling the pitcher no less than 2-3 times per day.Looking back, I should've bought another full-size Brita pitcher and filled the ice cube trays with filtered water.The pitcher is top-heavy. When full, this isn't a problem. When you're trying to pour your second glass of water (and that's about all this pitcher can carry), the top tends to come off, so you'll have to hold it with one hand to prevent it from detaching and falling out.If space is a problem, consider buying reusable water bottles. You can store them in a compact refrigerator and refill them using a full-size Brita pitcher."
2,Bad design,I am not very happy with this item. The top part is not attached to the filter and keeps falling off when trying to pour the filtered water. I recommend against buying this item.
1,No fluoride filtration!,"This pitcher and many others do not filter out fluoride. fluoride has been the culprit for chronic fatigue,fibromyalgia and other illnesses. I had been suffering from chronic fatigue for many years. I stopped using these type of filters and changed my diet. I can now say I feel 100 times better. I have much more energy and I'm not tired all day like before. The US is one of the only countries that puts fluoride in their drinking water. Fluoride is not suppose to be ingested."
2,TERRIBLY POOR DESIGN MAKES THIS A TOTAL DUD,"I have used Brita pitchers for years and years with great success. This has to be the worst product they have ever had on the market. I hate it! It is so hard to get the lid to line up with the pitcher and then to stay on, and it constantly falls off when I try to pour water out of the pitcher. If you have just filled the pitcher, there is nothing to keep the filtered water & the newly added water from mixing when you try and pour the darn thing while hanging on to the lid at the same time! I pitched this piece of junk into the trash. Shame on Brita for putting their once trusted name (at least by me) on this hunk of junk!"
5,Perfect size for one person!,This is the first time I have used a Brita filtration system and I will definately use them again and again! This pitcher fit perfectly in my 1.7cu ft fridge in my dorm room yet it holds a days worth of drinking water for one person. It is so simple to use but lacks the filter change indicator like other Brita pitchers.There was an obvious difference in taste of the filtered water compared to the tap water. It has been so easy for me to drink more water and I have even used it to filter water for my fish tank!
5,Good For Price,"I got this on sale for $7 back in November 2011. It's perfect for 1-2 people who strictly drink water. Any more, and you might consider getting a bigger sized water filter so you don't have to refill it as often.The one thing I really like about this filter is that at least for the one I received, the top lid is sealed tight so you can pour water out of it right after filling it to the top for filtration."
5,"straight forward, great price, does exactly what it's supposed to","straight forward, great price. does exactly what it's supposed to do, what more could you ask for.water tastes consistently good when i use this. It holds a ton of water yet doesn't take up all that much room in the fridge. 2 enthusiastic thumbs up!"
5,Great for the price,"I drink a lot of water, even though tap water over here is safe enough for drinking. a pitcher is an extra measure especially if you get sick and your defenses are low. This is my second purchase because well... my previous one fell down and it cracked, but still held its own until it was time to get a new one.However, this pitcher is not recommended for large families. We are just two in the house, my wife and I and we refill this one three to four times a day, so larger families need a bigger one if they drink as much as we do."
1,Black pieces in water for 3 days in a row...,"It's day three and even after 10 washes it still has black pieces in the water in the pitcher not the upper filter area. I would stay away from this one, I'm currently returning it myself."
2,Drips water and not large enough reservoir for family,"This pitcher leaked/dripped water on the ground and counter every time we used it. This occurred when the interior was seated properly and whether the pitcher was full or empty. We could only fill water cups over the sink as a result. Also, for a family of 4, this was completely insufficient for size and the amount of water it held. We filled it all day long and always ran out of water. We ended up replacing this with a larger capacity Brita pitcher that has a spout cover that opens and closes automatically when water is poured. Dripping solved."
5,Waterphobes Unite!,"Recommended for people who dislike water (as silly as that may seem) but need to increase their intake to stay well hydrated and are on a budget!This product takes away the funny taste of tap water, leaving it crisp and pure."
5,Good picture for a great price,"It is just like shown in the picture, the right size and makes a world of difference in coffee and tea makers. Instead of a white hard water build up they have run months with no deposits."
3,Cheap,"Since this is the cheaper end of the pitcher, you get what you pay for... Its very small and it fills a few cups up. The filter must be low grade because the water coming streaming through it very fast. Therefore I would get a higher end filter since its probably not doing it's job."
5,Great for dorms,"I got the slim version for my mini-fridge in my dorm. It works great, and keeps the stale metallic taste out of the tap water."
5,Perfect size for One,"Love this pitcher as it doesn't take up a huge amount of room in the fridge; it only runs out of water when I have guests over. Perfect size for one, unless you have a roommate that doesn't refill it after every glass!"
3,Fine and functional,"This pitcher works well for the purpose, but the filter top doesn't fit snugly and feels a bit unstable sitting in the base. (The base overlaps the sides of the filter.) It's not worrisome enough for me to return it, I'm just careful whenever I pour."
3,Works fine with a couple of a minor annoyances...,"Works fine but a couple of issues with the filter,the filter doesnt lock into place like the others, therefore if you arein a rush and tilt the pitcher more than 80 degrees, it will fall out. And also as with all Brita filters, the carbon particles get loose and float around in the top portion, so if the filter is not properly locked in position these could make their way to the pitcher with filtered water ruining the whole cause. Overall I have found PUR filters to be better, but ofcourse they cost a little extra."
1,Brita's quality got worse in recent years,"I have been using Brita pitchers for years. A few years ago I purchased a new one and realized that they have removed the attachment that tells you when to replace the filter. This was really a bad idea, not only it is hard to remember when to change your filter but after they changed the design I keep getting large black granules in my pitcher ach time I use it. I now need to re filter my filtered water to make sure I do not get any of these granules. I still have some filters left and I will use this pitcher until that time, after that I am switching to some other brand."
4,Additional Information,Here's more info on the Brita Pitcher:* Made in Canada* Both the pitcher and the filter are BPA free
4,Good but get a bigger one,Very good filter but it only holds like two cups of water. Is not sufficient for even one person. Invest a little more and get a bigger one
4,Works fine for the office,"Have used for a couple of months now. Stores nicely on the shelf in my office. No accidental spillage, no messes. Other reviewers have complained about the top falling off when tilting the pitcher to pour. I simply lay one finger on the top when pouring and that works fine. As long as you're not tilting the pitcher to some high angle, I don't think there should be a problem."
4,hello?,"OK here's a tip. When filtering water, put the top with the filter sideways, so it sits on the pitcher but the filter is not in it. Filter a whole pitcher and bottle it. More water to store. Also, keep the filter wet!! That will stop the carbon granules from getting in the water. But it works great regardless. Just use that tip to get more water at a time."
4,"Great size, still holds a lot","This pitcher is wonderful for a mini-fridge or fridges that don't have a lot of spare room. It fits right in the door, yet still holds a lot of water. I withheld a star simply for the material it is made of, as it seems that it can scraped or fractured semi-easily. But I still recommend this 100%, just be a little careful while using it."
2,rita 42629 Slim Pitcher,"I love the design and size, but the top with the filter keeps falling out when pouring. You have to keep your hand on the top when using."
2,Broke after 1st use,Bought for a Christmas gift and a day after my boyfriend used it the pitcher cracked and started leaking. May have been a random occurrence due to shipping. I love Brita so I returned this one and bought another from Wal-Mart.
2,Fluoride,It might take minerals such as iron but fluoride is still present in the water and it's over 1 part per million. It's still enough to affect health.
2,It is too small,"I was not careful and did not see the fine print about hte size (40 Oz, about 3~ 5 cups)of this product. This product is very small and I am not sure who will use this. Maybe college students or anyone single. It is useless for our family since we filter/drink lot of water daily."
1,question and problem,"I just got Brita 42629 Slim Pitcher today, when I put filter inside, and add water in , but terrible thing happened,the water came out is black color . Can you tell me why?"
2,The Lid is perfect!!! and the filter,Too bad the product was broke when I opened the box!! and there is no pitchs to replace from the brand as an option
2,not very satisfied,"could have got this for less..spent $15 on this which was more as compared to the one which i already have..anyways its a good product, go for it if you get it around $11-$12.."
5,Great deal.,My old pitcher broke after 15 years. This one is a simple size. It works great and I Love it.
2,Defective design,"I've used the Brita slim pitcher for a year. While it does indeed filter out some of the chlorine elements in the water, the pitcher is so poorly designed that you have to angle it very carefully and narrowly in order to avoid spilling water all over the counter when pouring. Moreover, the lid does not stay closed on top, and it will pop off from time to time causing massive water spillage. In short, it's too messy and a real hassle to use. Cheaply made of flimsy plastic and poorly designed. Not worth the ten dollars."
3,Lid sticks to reservoir,"Lid sticks to reservoir when trying to refill with water. You have to use two hands and you have to ""contaminate"" a clean area to separate the two pieces. It also is smaller than the one we had for about 10 years so it is more annoying that the lid sticks."
3,Pour over sink,"Every time I pour a glass of water the water drips down the pitcher. Half of the water goes in the glass, the other half goes on the counter. If you look closely, you'll notice a plastic lip that comes up right where the water comes out. This catches the water enough to cause it to drain down the pitcher. Other than that it works fine."
5,Good product,"I bought this thing because the tap water in my college smell bad, and when I boil it, it has the white sticky stuff in water. Thus, I bought this water pitcher because it was cheap. It turned out a very useful one. Water is now clearer than ever that I thought it was strange when there was no taste in the water. However, this is small water pitcher so it can't feed the family's members enough. But since I am with my roomate in college, This pitcher provides more than enough for me.Recommended this with pack of 3 filters; great value, and free shipping.Happy buying,"
1,Brittle filter,"Tank arrived with a crack right through it. There was nothing wrong with the box, and it was packaged well, so I can only make the assumption it was already cracked when it was packed. Not the best QA. Disappointed."
4,Brita Slim pitcher,"This product works as advertised. The only problem I have is, pouring, you have to be careful that the plastic filter holder does not disengage from the pitcher."
1,disappointing,I was expecting clean tasting water and what I got was a plastic/chemical taste. I have to gulp this water very fast just to get it down. I prefer the water that comes out of my faucet which is saying a lot because my faucet water is disgusting!not only that but black granules constantly leak from the filter.this is definately not worth the money.
2,Black film inside pitcher,"Inside there is a black film on the bottom and sides. I changed the filter thinking is just was extra charcoal. It came back. I washed out the pitcher with plain dish soap, it came back. Added a 1/4 tsp of clorox and filled up the pitcher with tap water. I removed the filter before doing this. The film is back and disgusting."
4,My First Brita,"This is my first Brita pitcher, and I am confident in saying it won't be my last. I needed something that fits in the mini-fridges for college and this... fits. I don't drink excessive amounts of water, but I do however want the water I do drink to be clean, so Brita does the job. As I understand it, all the filters have a ""problem"" with the charcoal, which is fixed by filtering water through it until it runs clear. Which is worth the effort. This model hasn't broken or leaked or given me any kind of problems (partially because I don't fill it up to the top) I think I've heard of.So to sum up: It's perfect for small fridges in college dorm rooms or offices, but if you have a normal fridge get a bigger model."
2,Very disappointed,When this pitcher arrived it was scratched so I sent it back. I've one before and I loved it...I will try again. I don't think it was a probel of Brita I think it was a shipping problem.
1,"charcoal particles in water, lid falls out","My old dorm building has some pretty awful tap water so I bought this to fit in my tiny fridge. After following all the instructions and running water through it a few times, the water would still have fine charcoal particles floating in it. I did this several more times and there's still particles floating in it. The final straw was at a certain angle the lid keeps falling out when pouring and even the filter would tumble out into the pouring reservoir. what a waste of time and cash."
1,Drips During Pour,"Very disappointed at the mess - filtered for the first time last night - chilled the water; pouring this morning - it drips while pouring, regardless of the speed of pour. OK - it's ""only water"" but it's very disappointing to have a pitcher that cannot pour!!!"
4,Best-tasting water ever!,"Changing filters is a bit of a nuisance (you can't just pop the old one out and a new one in, there's a bit of preparation) and about half of the time when you go to pop the lid off the whole unit comes out of the pitcher with it, but these are minor problems for what you get. I thought we already had good water in our county, but drinking it after it's been through the Brita filter is a whole new experience. I had no idea tap water could taste so good!The slim pitcher fits nicely in the refrigerator, too, as promised, hardly taking up any space at all. I wish I could give this 4-1/2 stars, because it's that close to perfect."
5,BRITA PITCHER,I LOVE TO DRINK WATER NOW BEFORE MY WATER ALWAYS HAD A BITTER TASTE AND SMELLED LIKE CHLOYRNE THANKS BRITA FOR MAKING THIS POSSABLE
1,Carbon in the water,Even after following all the instructions there were small black carbon pieces in my water. I was informed if I continue to drink the water from the filter it would seriously harm my health. It is appalling that a defective product like this can be sold on Amazon.com and something that can cause critical health concerns.I suppose that one piece was faulty but I would never buy this product again.
1,A real pain!,"I've inadvertently dropped two filters in the sink while attempting to pour the carbon pieces out of the tank. The filters do not lock into place. The lids also fall into the tank if not placed on carefully. The bottom of the filter always needs to be wet, so it doesn't dry. This means you're not going to get a lot of water before needing to refill. I would seriously consider shopping around before purchasing this product."
4,well...it IS better than tap water,"...at least in terms of taste! This one is attractive, compact, and very very low-cost.If you really want high quality filtered water however, no charcoal filter is EVER really going to compare with a decent reverse osmosis filter. Aside from a cup of tea in the morning and maybe a beer or two a few nights out of the week, water is 90% of my fluid intake. I used Brita filters for years as a college student, then finally splurged on a nice 4-stage, two hundred fifty dollar countertop R.O. filter with a 1 gallon reservoir. Sure it was bulky and kind of a pain to operate (had to buy a countdown timer to tell me when the reservoir was full, which usually took 35-40 minutes) but the water quality was so much better and totally worth the extra space, money, and time for someone like me who drinks almost a gallon of water a day.So get a charcoal filter like the Brita if you must, or if you don't drink all that much water a day."
1,Shipping problems,"The pitcher arrived in about thousand pieces.... where do I turn to to get a new one? It was not properly packed, I ordered two one was in perfect condition the other was completely shattered inside the orginal box.Thank you for letting me know how to proceed."
4,Everything was great,Got the filter exactly when i expected to get it. It was in great shape - for a great price. Service was good. I'd recommend (if asked) everyone to get a filter through this method.
1,avoid this one,The water filter falls out easily. Be extra careful or buy something else.This should bring a little disappointed.
4,Pretty decent pitcher,"+ Does everything it's supposed to- Has an open mouth that allows particles to get in easily. All the larger Britta Pitchers have an auto-closing mouth, why not this one?"
5,it's the best tasting water,and fits very neatly in the refrigerator! I'd recommend this product to boost your water consumption....
5,"great design, amazing filter","My boyfriend sent this to me as a gift with extra filters and i must say, this product is great! the fact that it's slim is great because I have a small fridge.The problem with the outer pitcher is that it can crack if you hit it on the corner of a desk/counter. Mine cracked a bit so i called up Brita and they are sending me a new pitcher! There is a 90 day warranty on the pitcher but I'm sure Brita wouldn't know if you lied about the date of your warranty ending.Be sure to read the directions on setting up the filter, and enjoy :]"
4,Perfect for 1 or 2 people.,"I have been using this pitcher for about a month now, and am still happy with it. It is a perfect way to keep cold filtered water for one or two people (it is just myself using it) since it only holds 3 or 4 full glasses of water at once. The handle is slightly awkward at times if you have big hands like me, but nothing terrible"
4,"Tastes great, saves a ton of $!","I bought this for two reasons: One, with the economy being what it is these days, I was looking for some ways to save some money and previously we bought a lot of bottled water. Two, we bought one specific brand that only came in individual bottles, and I could see we were producing WAY too much waste by buying them.I'm surprised to find that the water does taste pretty good (and I am VERY picky), way better than ""naked"" tap water though not quite as crisp as purified bottled water. Bottom line is I can fill the pitcher from the tap without any additional costs for water and I have completely eliminated the massive waste we were generating! The filters last a long tme, and I think this is a great way to help the environment and save a bit of money as well."
3,It gets the job done but,It is too tall for my mini-fridge but it still works. I wish it was shorter and maybe in several different colors
3,"It does its job, but...","I was excited to get a brita filter. I had recently moved out of state, but the city water here has a lot of iron in it, so I knew I would need something to get rid of the smell and taste of the water. I ordered this hoping that it would do its job, and it did, but the plastic container cracked within the first three hours of usage. The filter has popped out of place multiple times, and the filter leaves the water a bit discolored.Otherwise, though, it does its job, and I don't have to deal with the smelly and nasty tasting city water anymore."
2,Poorly designed,"Holds enough water and the shape is nice as it might even fit on refrigerator door, but it turned out to be another piece of junk from amazon. In the last year or two nearly everything I order from Amazon fails to meet my diminishing expectations.The problem is that the mechanism which houses the filter doesn't fit snugly enough into the pitcher, and if you don't use two hands to pour, the whole thing will plop out, knocking over your glass and spilling water all over the place. However if you try pressing the mechanism down into the pitcher, you're going to have a terrible time extricating it. DON'T BUY THIS PITCHER."
1,Carbon dust?,"""It is normal for carbon dust to appear in your first 2 pitchers or 1 dispenser"" um ... this my tenth time i added water and still there is carbon dust ><"
3,"Good filter, bad design.",The water that comes out of this filter is great. The lid continually falling off unless you hold it on while pooring is awful.
1,No cover for spout,"I'm returning this pitcher because it is faulty, the lid is loose and there is no cover for the spout. I intend to leave this pitcher in the refrigerator at work, which is kind of nasty and I do not want the odors and anything else floating around in the bridge to get into my water. I think this is a major problem with this pitcher if anyone is planning to leave it out or in the fridge. This was a huge waste of money."
2,Small pitcher with annoying lid,"Unfortunately this pitcher is a bit smaller than I realized -- you get roughly two and a half small glasses of water for each time you fill it. I don't mind if my water isn't fully cold, so that isn't really a problem but I do refill at least once or twice a day. Where that really becomes frustrating is that every time you try to get the last of the water out, the filter moves/falls around inside. Plus, if you don't hold the lid firmly in place it will come off. If you rarely drink water this product is probably great, but it was not really what I was looking for."
3,Lid is loose,"I've read some people say the lid is too tight and they need to pry it off. With mine, the lid is very loose, so when I tip the pitcher over to pour a glass of water, I have to use 2 hands and hold the lid on or else I'll have a flooding disaster all over the counter!We'll see how long this pitcher holds up. Today is the first day."
4,Good Enough,The size is perfect for someone who lives alone. One little thing that bugs me is that black little particles keep appearing every time I filter new water. I understand it's some sort of carbon dust from the filter. It doesn't going into the actual water I drink so I'm not too bothered. I followed the instructions and soaked it in cold water and all that but it doesn't really have much effect. Other than that the filter is good.
1,"this thing's great, if you like filling the pitcher up every time you want a glass of water","don't be mislead. this thing holds just over two 16oz glasses of water. if all you drink are 8oz classes i guess its not too bad, but in my house we drink 16. so if you have large glasses, and you like filtered water, i suggest staying away from this thing unless you want to refill it five times a day."
1,why the filter i got does not look like a new one? but i pay for a new one price?,i opened the box and found the slim pitcher does not look like a new one. there are badly scraches on the surface and dirty inside!!!!
2,This item is not good at all,"For starters being plastic sucks to begin with, but that's what Brita offers.This item has a massive problem with the LID. It does not stay on. This is a design flaw.Here's another weird design idea..The Handle is HOLLOW allowing water to pass right through it,so if you accidentally get water in the handle, and then set it down on the counter, it will leakall over the place.It has too many small crack and crevices where it's hard to clean and the plastic wears outover time.It doesn't hold much water and you have to constantly fill it up."
2,Divided on this product.,"My girlfriend decided that she no longer wanted to buy plastic water bottle. Even though I prefer Poland springs. So I get this for her. The package arrived on time, I followed the cleaning and usage instructions. The problem is that the water in this thing taste horrid! It has a coal like taste. I know this may not make sense but let me put it to you this way. The tap water tastes better before putting it into this thing. That's a huge problem. We're keeping the product to see if the water eventually tastes any better but who knows. I'm not sure if it's just Britta or a defective product."
4,"Water For One, Please!","Ordered this slim model as I live by myself. For guests I aim to set some aside in a gallon container. It is the perfect size for one person. I set at least one refill aside in the bathroom for my puri pot and oral care. It is so quick and easy to use. As I rent I cannot install any inline filters. But this filters the chlorine and limestone from my tap water so I don't have to buy bottled water to:1. get tasty water,2. insure appliances don't clog and3. germ proof oral and nasal care. (ewwww! IK)Plus it is so good to have simply clean, clear, water to drink and to make beverages; not to mention ice cubes with. I just refill and refrigerate after each use and I am good to go! Thanks"
3,Nice introduction to water filtration,"This was my first water filtration device.Good things:1. Fairly cheap2. Water tastes better3. Removes some impurities.4. I drink more water as a result of the better tasting water5. You don't have to install anything in your sinkBad things1. Small, have to refil over and over. Takes forvever2. Recently found out that other brands/models remove more impurities than this model (although they are more expensive).I'm recently saying goodbye to this product as I am now willing to make the investment in higher quality filtration. I am however going to give all my Brita stuff to my parents for them to use because it is certainly better than drinking tap."
4,Nice Little Pitcher,Very nice Brita pitcher for refrigerators that are shorter on space. Water tastes great and saves you (and the earth) tons on not having to buy bottled water. Only drawback is that this particular model is a small capacity pitcher and the constant refilling can be a little annoying at times.
2,Not as good as I expect,"The filter does its job, it seems the water get less smell after the filter. However, there are a lot of black particles coming out from the filter everyday. I don't like that. And when you pour the water , the top will slip out. I may try a different model in the future."
2,Missing Key Product Feature,"This Brita model is missing a flap for the spout. This may seem inconsequential, but it's actually important if you don't want dust/ refrigerator smell taste in your water. I recommend purchasing a model with a spout flap."
3,"Really too small, should be cheaper",It holds very little water and takes several minutes to filter.It would be okay if the thing wasn't so expensive. I wish I had just purchased the bigger pitcher.
3,"So far, so good.","The only reason I shaved off 2 stars is because the lid keeps falling off when I use it with a single hand. I mostly use is my other hand to hold it. But when I'm cooking and need that half cup of water to keep the dish from burning or whatever, the lid falling off into the pot just doesn't help.Wish it was constructed a little better and had a better way to lock/hold the lid in place."
4,Good little pitcher,"I got this pitcher the other day, and so far I like it. It holds enough water to fill my coffee maker, and it's not too big. It fits just fine in my fridge. It also fills up really fast thanks to being so small, which is awesome.My only gripe is that the top is hard to pull off when you need to fill it up. It causes the whole inside unit to come out. I find that if you dig your fingernails into it rather than trying to lift it with your fingertips helps. It's only a small gripe.I recommend this to anyone who lives alone or with just one other person or has a small fridge.Bonus: Tasty water."
4,Brita Slim Pitcher with Filter,The brita filter works great and the size is perfect for my mini fridge.
4,Great for a small fridge,"This is my second Brita Slim Pitcher - the first served me well for a long time, until I dropped it on a brick patio. It's great for a small fridge like mine. I hate the waste of bottled water and use my Brita to fill a Nalgene bottle instead. One of my favorite features is the the dial that tells me when to replace the filter (because I can never remember when I put the last one in...)I've owned Pur and GE water pitchers, but always go back to Brita.One last comment - if you soak a new filter for 15 minutes in a glass of water before using it for the first time as per the directions you won't see ANY ""black granules"" (charcoal) in your water."
3,"does its job, but could be better","I bought this to replace a PUR water pitcher that I had and am a little disappointed. It does an ok job filtering the water and I like that it is a small. The main problem I have with this pitcher is the lid design - It sticks to the top ""resevoir"" and pulls out the whole top section. You have to use a fingernail or knife to pry it open just to add water each time.The other thing I was disappointed by, is the filter itself. The PUR filters have a marker on them to let you know when they have been used completely. This Brita pitcher included a static sticker to place on the pitcher to notify you when to replace the filter (3 months). I don't think this is very accurate, since some people may not use there pitcher as much as others.It's an ok product, but I wish I had researched more carefully regarding the lid at least."
1,Stale Water,"This pitcher is cheap, and you get what you pay for. It has very poor functional design. The chamber that holds the water to be purified and the purifier will pop out of the pitcher while pouring water unless you pour at a very shallow angle. And since there is no spout cover, the purified water will take on all the funky smells of your refrigerator if left to sit for too long."
3,Clean Water Is Good...,"I needed clean water because the city I live in has water that smells like a swimming pool. I bought the Brita and it works great! I would suggest getting a different model though because this one doesn't seal. There's an open pour spout, so the water is exposed making it possible to become unclean again."
5,great deal on this item as an add on,"had a little trouble getting the filter lined up and locked in, but got the hang of itlike the slim design a lot!"
2,Lots of scratches,"First time I bought this from Amazon, there were a lot of scratches around the pitcher so I returned and requested for a new one. When I got the new one, there were more scratches all over which should be resulted from the poor packaging. So, I returned it for the second time and requested for refund.Finally, I bought the same product from King Soopers at a slightly higher price but I can choose the one with fewest scratches (out of 4 on the shelf)."
2,Be careful of the open water container!,"Regardless of the performance of the filter itself, I must issue a warning about this particular model. Its permanently open spout, unlike other models, is inherently unsanitary, and it my apartment, it attracted roaches to crawl in there and drown. Our water filter pitcher became a roach graveyard! It's pretty disgusting, and we can't use it anymore. Please make sure that whatever model you buy has a CLOSED SPOUT."
3,Good Value.,"Small, fashionable, & reliable pitcher. Perfect use for a single person on a budget. The filtered water you get from Brita is par as expensive bottle-water brands you buy at the store. The only minor annoyance is a frequent speck of carbon here and there between pitcher refills. The carbon specks tend to sink to the bottom of the pitcher. I find myself rinsing out the pitcher every few refills to remove them annoying little carbon specks. My Brita pitcher saves me $25. monthly compared to buying those little bottles of water at the store. Brita costs less than Pur water systems.Pros: Small, Fashionable, & reliable pitcher. Perfect for single people on a budget (Save up to $25. monthly).Cons: Frequent carbon specks that like to mingle at the bottom of the pitcher."
5,Great Product,"Item was my first Brita filter, always thought it was bull crap. Really makes a huge difference. Water tastes so much better."
1,Not worth the money!,"I bought the brita slim pitcher a month back, as per the instruction booklet i soaked the filer in water about 20 minutes before using it to prevent the black specs.But even know when i fill the pitcher i see black specs floating in the stainer cup.So i have stopped using the pitcher anymore.I would advise others not to buy this even tough it is a brita product but not a good quality one."
3,black particles,"Every time I pour out the water from the pitcher, there are always a little of black particles going into my cup."
2,Okay,"I got this for $6, which is why I did not return it. Item was not new as stated, with no seal and bubble wrap. The actual pitcher itself is pretty good."
1,Very Disappointed,"The little black granules that everyone talks about are definitely a problem for me. And we found something else swimming in the water. Our other bigger, Brita pitcher is better than the small one insofar as suspicious looking stuff floating around, but still. . . As someone else said, I bought it take the junk out of the water, not to put it in. Done with Brita."
2,Fits but doesn't perform,"While I like the pitcher for its easy fit in my refrigerator, I am disappointed by how little it holds and how frequently I have to refill it. Honestly, two good glasses of water, and you've got to start again. More frustrating than that is the fact that when you get to the bottom of the pitcher, the angle you are pouring out causes the inset reservoir to fall out of the pitcher. Messy and difficult."
2,Lid falls off,"The lid is loose, so while pouring water it falls off. Besides, i can see black particles floating in filtered water dont know how that passes through filter."
3,Poor design,This pitcher would have gotten 5 star if it wasn't for two design flaws. The main issue I have with this pitcher is when you are filling it up with water black granules from the filter falls into the pitcher which then goes into your drinking cup. The second issue is the top. The top/internal filter housing was not designed to snap in or fit securely into the pitcher so on occasion it falls out. I drink a lot of water and to me this pitcher does not hold a lot of water. I find myself refilling it 3 to 5 times a day.
2,Britta pitcher,"No problems with the pitcher or filter, but the water tastes unpleasant, not as good as my filtered water from my refrigerator...even replaced the first new filter."
1,This product is garbage,"I bought this pitcher to replace a PUR one that I had trouble finding replacement filters for--it seems that P&G; decided to change its filter designs without pausing to see if it would fit older models.Now onto Brita. As others have said, the top will come out when pouring at extreme angles because it doesn't hook into the base of the unit, making the product cumbersome to use. For that and the reasons concerning limited capacity, you should look elsewhere."
4,saved me so much money,We used to spend so much money on spring water. Tap water is very heavy so this pitcher was just perfect.
1,problems,Brita let us down--the inner part and the filter fall out VERY easily every time you use it--not like the other products..Kay .
3,Nice pitcher but smaller than wanted,"We have a Brita water filter pitcher and it's much larger, so I was expecting the new one to be the same size so make sure you check the fluid oz. on the ""Slim pitcher"" emphasis on SLIM."
3,Hold on to your hat!,"Have not been using any kind of water filter pitcher for several years, but recently, decided to try to drink more water every day. Didn't want to use ANY plastic bottles so that left me shopping for a new water filter pitcher. I have a very small fridge and thought this pitcher would not take up too much space. It's actually pretty cool looking and is very narrow. Fits nice in my small fridge along side other beverages and pitchers. Keep in mind it is small and does not hold that much water at any given time. There are only two of us in the household and it's fine for us. Would not be good for a family though.As other reviews have noted, you'll need to use your finger to hold the whole thing together when you pour. If you don't... it'll vomit it's guts out on the counter all over your glass and everything else. It's surprising that Brita would take so much care designing something that looks great and not give a minutes thought to how practical it would be."
4,"really, good and affordable","this pitcher is slim and fit in my refrigerator perfectly, i don't have any problems with coal appearing in the the water, i saw small amounts for the first day or two but its harmless to drink. I don't see any evidence of coal in the water anymore and the expiration sticker for the filter is very helpful."
2,Not that great-50% improvement at best,"I bought this trying to cut costs by eliminating the water delivery service we use. I had previously tried using one of the filters that goes directly on the tap. It worked great, but we found it was always getting in the way and greatly reduced water pressure even when we weren't using the filtration. So I thought I'd give the pitcher route a try.I live in OKC which is supposed to have the best tasting municipal water according to the ""American Waterworks Association"". I think it's horrible, but I guess I'm picky. Apparently super-picky because even though this pitcher did make the water better, it was still pretty awful to me. I'd say it gave a 50% improvement. So depending on how sensitive your sense of taste and smell is, you might want to go with an on-tap filter."
1,NEVER AGAIN...,"Takes up too much space in the fridge yet only holds about 3-4 cups of water, takes too long to fill up, water still tastes like tap water (yuck)! Back to buying bottled water. I guess green is not my color..."
1,"Used to be good, Now don't waste your $",In Columbia SC we have been voted to have the best city water in the nation. I purchased a Britta about 2 yrs ago to filter out the Chlorine. At first I was thrilled with the Britta but noticed in the last few months the water tastes different (like charcoal) even after I replaced the filter and ran several pitchers through it. My husband said the same thing with the pitcher he bought for his work from a store 2 hrs away so I don't think it was just a bad batch.I have a bladder condition so the water I consume is very important. I now only drink Deer Park water because it has a Ph of 8 and the bottles are made of less plastic than regular water bottles.
2,Won't Fit in Small College Fridges,"I bought the slim brita filter to put into the personal fridges that everyone uses in college. The pithcer DOES NOT FIT in the side compartment. I had to take the bottom rows out to make room. The filter works great, but you should upgrade to a larger model because I am constantly refilling the pitcher. If you are buying this model for its slim design to fit into the personal fridges, I suggest buying a different model because it will NOT FIT in the side compartment."
3,Good Ol' Brita,"I always like my water to be tasteless and Brita does the job. The only downside to this particular pitcher is the small capacity. It boasts of being a space saver, well naturally because it doesn't hold that much water. If you have more than two people who use the pitcher get a bigger size one."
3,Heavy to pick up and refill,"If you drink a lot of filtered water, just buy a dispenser. Your arm will thank you later. It also kept getting stuck and hitting the light in the refrigerator. It kept hitting the light every time i took it in and out and it is fairly heavy so prepare to lift weights every time you get a drink of water. Otherwise works pretty well but doesn't hold all that much water."
5,Great water purifier,The tap water in my building tastes absolutely horrible. This slim little pitcher and its accompanying filter produce great-tasting water - light in texture and without any nasty aftertaste. I highly recommend it!
3,It works.,"I've gotten a few of the black carbon granules in the filtered water part but not many, and part of that may be because I don't wait for the water to finish filtering before I pour and some of the pre-filter reservoir water drips into the filtered water resevoir (the lid is not totally sealable). Mostly they come out into the pre-filter resevoir. It fit very well in my refrigerator, but we have to fit it too often because of the small size, and it takes quite a long time! Still, not a bad product."
3,Too Small!,"Yes, I know it's called the Slim Pitcher but it hardly holds any water, Also when you go to pour, the top and inside filter holder comes out. Better off going with the regular size and keeping it on the counter. It does, however, fit in the refrigerator door."
5,"Works great, water tastes great","I purchased this to filter water before putting it in my keurig in an effort to help with scaling, etc. So far so good. My daughter now refuses to drink water directly from the tap. She wants it from the Brita pitcher. I like that it is narrow and doesn't take up too much space."
5,It works,I have a water well with high mineral content. This filters out enough of the minerals to make it better than bottled water.
1,horrible lid design,"I read some reviews about the poor lid design, but I was in a hurry to get a replacement pitcher. So I went ahead and bought it anyway. OMG it is horrible. Don't try to use pitcher if there is still water in the top container, because the water will pop the lid off, and you will get a big puddle every time."
5,Excellent slim water pitcher,I bought this pitcher for my wife and loved the fact that it fits in our small refrigerator's door. I drink water out of the tap but she tells me that it is excellent for fresh-tasting water that is nice and cold. The filters are a bit pricey but by doing a bit of online sleuthing I can usually find great deals on the 3 packs - and they don't run out quickly so that is a plus. Great buy!
4,"nice water fiter, reasonable price","I had this water filter for about a month, and I like it.It is cheaper than those sold at WalMart, yet it get the job done well. The water taster good and I drink it everyday."
3,Nice,"This pitcher is nice because it is slim and fits in our constantly full fridge. It seems to make good water. It is on the small size, which is fine for us because we only have 2 water drinkers. However, if your family all enjoy water, you would want a much bigger pitcher as you would be constantly refilling it."
3,good for price and comes with filter,good for price and comes with filter but because it is so cheap you don't want to replace the filter since the price is so similar!
3,Go 4 a Bigger One,"Why do you want to refill it umpteen times, its too small and is ideal for just ONE PERSON, but, if U want to avoid filling it again and again then go for a bigger one.Water Quality is good and the lid seems to be stuck everytime to the filter, u have to detach it everytime while re-filling."
3,Good value but need 2 hands to pour,"What you see is pretty much what you get: a smaller pitcher that has a clean and appealing look. However, what you cannot tell from the picture is that you have to hold the top cover while pouring or the entire solid white portion of the pitcher (including the filter) will tilt and fall out of place, which can lead to spilled water. Therefore, you have to use both hands to properly pour the pitcher. I might have opted for another Brita pitcher if I knew this beforehand. Nonetheless, I find it to be a good value."
2,The box it came in was made of PVC!!!!,"Very good idea of filtering the water to eliminate toxins and chemicals BUT there is not info on what type of plastic is the filter is made off, the box my filter came in had a number 3 for the plastic ( this means PVC, the most toxic plastic ever made!!!).The pitcher itself Does Not Have info on the plastic type!you could assume that if they use PVC for the box they could also use it for the Jug itself.Manufacturer should specify this!!!"
1,Water tastes worse after filtering,"Straight tap water tastes better. I did as instructed. Soaked the filter for 15 minutes, and ran a few pitchers through before I drank any. Water tasted bad, so I ran a few more pitchers through. Still tastes like chemicals, or plastic. I tried filtering the water into a glass pitcher and it still tastes bad. The compartment that holds the filter even smells like chemicals or plastic. I thought Brita water was supposed to taste better than tap water. At least I didn't waste too much money, but this experience is not going to make me want to go out and buy any more Brita products."
1,Not good..,"it's worst Brita pitcher I ever seen. Lid doesn't fix firmly, it just comes off while pouring the water...I didn't like it."
5,Perfect,"It is super awesome. The price is cheap!! Like it!! It filt the water and make me feel healthy.:) I used it everyday and I think it's necessary to filt the water before you drink it. After I used it for 2 months, I found there are some particle inside the reservoir, which means it really works and filt impurity in water."
4,Brita Slim Pitcher,"My first Brita Slim Pitcher was delivered today and I put it into immediate use, after I soaked the new Brita Filter in water for 15 minutes as directed. The first thing I did however was, test the tap water using a Digital TDS Meter which I purchased days before and I got a reading of 175 ppm. I then tested the filtered water and I got a reading of 100 ppm. I noticed that the water has a fresher taste and it no longer has the chlorine smell."
4,much more inexpensive,The Picher is what exactly I want.But it might be bigger than a new comer thought.So I am somewhat afraid I don't need two at once.
2,Broke with first use,"Filled it with water, put it in the fridge, went to use it an hour later and the pitcher had broken and water was everywhere.I have had brita pitchers before and loved them, so I will just assume that this was a fluke- I will update after I return and they send me a new one."
4,Love my new Pitcher,"I've purchased Brita Pitchers in the past but for some reason or another, I never kept them. This particular one I do find myself using all the time, in lieu of buying bottled water. Completely eliminates that chlorinated taste from my tap water but then again, that's not the pitcher, it's the filters. They're not as expensive as I remember and since they're rated for 2gal/day for 2 months, I think I can push mine to 3. 10 bucks every 3 months isn't bad at all. It's the perfect size just for me as I live alone."
5,Perfect fit for the task...,I purchased this for a small office refrigerator. It is a perfect fit for the door and it is to fill and pour.
1,Dead on arrival,"The pitcher arrived with a giant crack along the front end of the clear container, rendering it useless as a water container. The top of the thing was jammed into the pitcher so far that it left a scuff mark, and was incredibly hard to pry out. Your experience may not be the same, but I was expecting the product to come to me in one piece."
2,its fine,"When I got this, the inside is full of dust, I spent a long time to clean this. Also, while I pour water inside the pitcher, there are a lot black dots come out of the middle, not so convenient tho."
3,OK pitcher,Water taste great but after you fill up two glasses you have to refill the pitcher and wait for it to filter... and then sit in the fridge to become cold...
2,Doubtful,"reading the pages, I said it is that I need. Unfortunately, I found I was wrong after a week. At first, the odor of the chlorine still remains in the pitcher, so I have to boil the water. Second, the water tasts odd after being filtrated. I always felt my tongue numb. What a terrible shopping."
3,Only Three Stars,"I've expected a lot from this product, but its not upto the mark.Only a little volume can be used."
4,Brita filtered slim pitcher,I purchased this item for a gift. From the feedback I have received this is an excellent pitcher and meets the needs of the student using it. Brita is a quality name.
2,Not as good as Barking but still funny,"Must say i was a bit disapointed with this one. I absolutely loved Barking and found this one more difficult to really get into. Also, the characters aren't all that likeable, at times found myself wishing they'd just get on with losing their souls."
2,Not as good as Holt's other stuff.,This return to J. W. Wells & Co with new employees and clients is not nearly as good as the earlier books. The story seems a little re-tread and most of the characters are flat and uninteresting. Pretty disappointing considering how much I enjoyed the others.May be worth reading just to complete the set. But then again maybe not.
2,"was ""Underwhelmed""","Mr. Holt has a nice style and is clever, no doubt, however the book was not exactly what i anticipated. No matter that often happens and i am pleasently surprised. This was not case with this book. I kept reading it hoping it would draw me in, but alas it didn't. I had to put it in the ""can't get through this tome stack"" which fortunately is a small one for me.The characters were rather depressing in tone and the plot of the devil purchasing out a struggling firm well, is promising but it didn't deliver the type of humor i would expect from british author. I have read many who have made me devoted fans ( Jasper Fforde for one) but Mr. Holt, i wil pass on your wit."
4,Good quality but barely enough power,"While this has proven to be a quality product having seen regular use since I purchased it in 2006, it often fails to provide the power needed for simple tasks like removing lugs, especially if the shop was the last one to tighten them. It almost defeats the purpose. For most other small jobs it is sufficient. You may want to consider something with a little more power, but it will do if its all that fits the budget (as was my case)."
3,Bluegrass paradise,I thought the instrimental stuff was okay but you had to be a Vassar fan to recognize some of the tunes.
5,selling in the internet era,This book has given us new direction to our sells effort and how we think about selling. We are in a competitive enrironment and Going for the Green has given me a fresh look at how we should approach our selling. The book was engaging and extremly insightful in how we need to approach our customers today.
3,This is no bargain ......,"This is no bargain because there is no dispenser with it. You can't tell from the picture that there is no dispenser. For about the same money you can buy it at HD which comes with its dispenser and can easily be cut at will. I was fooled by the picture but would definitely not buy it again; the description should say this but it does not !! I guess saying ""refill"" in the description means no dispenser !!"
1,Horrible legs extension,"The second segment of the leg extension was very stiff and appeared to be very poorly fitted together. I encountered the same problem on two of the legs. You have to pull very hard to extend the legs out. After a couple of attempts, you can see the paint started to come out around the aluminum tubes because the two sections were grinding so hard against each other. The same problem happens when you want to retract the leg. Now I know why this tripod was on sale with a deep discount. You DO NOT want to have this problem when you are in the field."
2,6.6 LB load capacity,"Sunpak 4300 Pro is definitely light weight. The load capacity is only 6.6LB according to the box and user guide. Advertised 11 LB max load is either an error or a joke. Once getting all the section extended, you can feel how wobbly it can be."
2,It only takes one tiny broken piece,"Let's talk about what was right: very portable, light weight, and the quick release was very easy. The ballhead had smooth movement. Unfortunately, what went wrong makes it a poor choice: the legs. With all three segments extended, the legs don't feel sturdy. And it only took one tiny broken piece to make it practically unusable - unless you are the duct tape type. A very small white piece of plastic is a crucial piece on the inside of the leg that keeps the latch tight when the legs are extended. This piece was broken on one leg, so the leg would not stay extended and hold the weight of the camera. I contemplated exchanging for the same model, but I decided not to buy this item again because of the risk associated with the leg design. I want a reliable product. So, instead of buying cheap, I opted for the higher quality tripod by Manfrotto, which hopefully will arrive this week."
2,hmm...,"Was not impressed with this item. The legs were ok, but the head was crap! It broke and fell apart after a couple uses. If you want these legs, they are fine. If you love your gear, DO NOT use this head!"
4,bathroom reading,"My family & friends Jus love it, coming over an having these books to laugh At, during their quit time."
3,A swift-moving spy story,"Michael Reynolds is fleeing the police in Hungary, near the Austrian border. Indeed he was commissioned by colonel Peter Mackintosh to reach a certain Jennings in Budapest before the forthcoming International Scientific Conference. When the police eventually catch Reynolds, the latter claims that his name is Johann Buhl, businessman and resident of Vienna and that he was invited to Hungary by the Economic Ministry. Subsequently, he is taken to the Andrassy Ut, headquarters of the AVO, the Hungarian Secret Police by Colonel Szendr. But Reynolds knows that no one has ever escaped from the AVO Headqquarters, from the torture chambers in Stalin Street. If he is ever to escape, it will have to be from inside Szendr's car within the next hour.In ""The Last Frontier"", published in 1959, just three years after the crushing of the October Revolution by the Russian troops, the reader can relive the early days of the Cold War through this twisty and original spy story."
5,One of the best Butt workouts!,"I almost rated this 4 stars because I didn't care for the upper body work added in, but it works the lower body so well, that it deserves a 5. The music is great!It starts out with a fun warmup then moves into dips. You can do the plyo lunges, or stay with the first set of regular dips. Next are series of 1 legged dead lifts, then pleas, then regular dead lifts, and a variety of lunges that are static. The floor work is tough as well. There is a break in the video that gives you the option to do the standing work 1 day, then the floor work the next. It really will give you a brand new butt!"
5,Love it!,The cap was a gift for a friend in another country and he loved it. He says it fits wonderfully and looks good too. Timely delivery.
2,Sorely disappointed,"This book typifies an endemic problem in art history literature: there are a great many scholars with an encyclopaedic knowledge of their subject but who lack the pedagogic and technical skills needed to communicate it in written format. Mr. Anfam is obviously an authority on this most fascinating of art genres, but he is an absolutely terrible writer. I am an ardent fan of abstract expressionism but found the book difficult to finish because it was written so awkwardly. A second complaint regards not just this book but this entire series. The dearth of color plates is understandalbe in so inexpensive a book, but it is especially regrettable for a book covering so dynamic a subject matter. In summary, I would look elsewhere for an introduction to this genre: Mr. Anfam's writing does not do the subject justice."
2,lots of info that's not well prganized,"I bought this book to learn more about the Abstract Expressionism period and painters. While this book provides info on this, it does so in a way that is not very focused or structured which makes it difficult to read. This book is definitely NOT a page-turner and did little to satisfy my thirst for info on the subject. I haven't picked it up for months because it makes me tired. The black and white pictures are really just pointless."
5,"AWESOME, AWESOME BOOK","This is a must read for all birthmothers, adoptees and adoptive parents. For clinicians who work within the adoption field, this book should be mandatory reading in order to understand the experience of the mother who places her child for adoption. Schaefer's book is powerful and honest and will touch the hearts of everyone."
3,Emotionally captivating...at first.,"I thought this book had an amazing beginning. The authors pain was felt through my fingertips straight to my heart. I truely felt sorry for her and as an adoptee I was told all along that ""your birthmother gave you up because she loved you"". I felt that the author got to be a bit obsessive with finding her birth son, granted she had every right. In the beginning of the book, she clearly wrote that her experience giving up her baby was forever etched in her mind, but further in the book she kept referencing that she ""forgot"" this person, or didn't remember where things were.....all she had to do was turn back 4 or 5 chapters! or was I missing something?"
1,much misinformation or lack of fact checking,"I have read only a few entries in this book but they are so egregiously incorrect that I question the rest of the information. To assert that the world's oldest tree is a California Redwood of 12,000 years is preposterous. The entry on Roger Clemons, where it asserts he has won the triple crown twice, is also ludicrous as he is a pitcher; only hitters can win a triple crown"
