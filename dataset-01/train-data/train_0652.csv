3,Mo Thugs III: The Mothership...,"What's operatin'...This album is cool, but there needs to be more distinction between the artists! I'm sayin'...the artists need to show skills on more of a single(solo) representation! It sounds like alot of artists goin' off all at the same time, and/or just doin verses. The record could be contructed where each artist is setting the other up, or introducing one another, or even better...comin' off of each other more,like to help shocase everybody's different lil' styles. I'm just listenin'...know what I'm sayin'. I got my computer hooked through studio(stereo) equipment...comin' through high quality monitors, and it still sounds somewhat distorted! Mix is always important, but I know how things can get hectic, and whatever... when it comes to that too. Overall... beats, and flow is cool though! Just keep doin' it. Get paper... ""Lay"", ""Twon"", ""O"", ""Blac Hole of Watts""-AKA-""The Menenskis"""
5,Bone Thugs N Harmony is at it again!,I have been a fan and supporter of Bone Thugs and they have yet to upset me. They are constantly coming out with quality cd's that never bore me even with Mo Thugs. It was never bout the east or west. Its was the CLE.
3,i hate to admit it but they slippin,"i've been a huge bone fan since forever (creepin is their best CD) and have lately have noticed them slippin. ressurection and this album have the same things wrong with them. first, they lost that sound that made the DIFFERENT. tha crossroads remix was so different from all the other rap stuff and AOW also was different. not only did this (and ressurection) sound like any rap album out there, i couldn't even tell the songs apart. some songs were killer though, like the backyard and everything green and flesh's song."
3,The power Of LAYZIE BONE ( BONE THUGS N HARMONY ),"This is a straight album mainly for BONE THUGS N HARMONY or just LAYZIE BONE fans and followers. 80% of tha album is tight. Even J-Bone ( layzie lil' son ) was tight "" The Backyard "". It was more like a family affair, but it would have been even better if Krayzie, Bizzy,& Wish could have been there so Layzie would have somebody to harmonize with. Flesh got a solo "" If I Can Go Back"". Str8 up from a Bone fan out tha south listen to "" This Ain't Livin"" Layzie f. Felicia or "" Everything Green""(Layzie solo) first. Keep tha faith BONE back! Emmortal Thugs & Skant are the only ones that rap fast. Layzie's brothers Steward Howse( Emmortal Thugs) and Stanley Howse (Flesh n Bone) are both here for support. Don't forget Felicia, Skant Dawg, & Ken Dawg from MO THUGS 2. Felicia is just as good with Layzie Bone as she was when she was with Krayzie Bone."
3,Another One to Avoid,"Like many of the other Japanese packaged Bob shows, this one falls short as well. The quality is absolutely horrid, sounding as if whomever dubbed the concert sat in the back with his tape recorder stuffed in his back pocket. This is made even more trajic by the concert itself, which must have been pretty good to those in Paris in 1980. The I-3's open, and all in all the set list and bob's vocals are up to his standards. Unfortunately for me, it takes (more money) down the toilet to vow ""I will never, ever, buy another one of these shows"". You should do the same, and DO NOT buy this cd."
5,excellent cookbook,This is a great cookbook with many good recipes. Great illustrations and easy to follow instructions. I would highly recommend it.
5,Excellent!,Great product. Very easy for my 3 year old daughter to use. The different colors work great. My daughter likes that she can wear it with all of her princess outfits.
5,Best since Heavy Mental,"I just got this album today, and already i've listened to it 5 or 6 times all the way through.. the wordplay is incredible, the production is awesome, and i think we can all be pleased with KP's long awaited Offering. I highly recommend this CD to any KP or Wu Tang fan."
4,Minimal instructions,"20 06 11Seems to be made of high-quality materials, works as it should, but you must get instructions from the internet if you wish to understand all the features.John Lukens"
2,"This was a replacement, I should have looked harder and further..","I purchased this sighting compass because I lost my other one on a recent trip. This one looks identicle to my lost one, but a huge difference in working operations. I have been using a sighting compass for 40 years. The one I lost was over 25 years old. This unit looks the same but I can't get the same reading twice in a row. There is not lock to stop and hold the moving dial when closed. This prevents the dial from getting shaken and abused when in your pocket or pack. It is extreamly sensative to metal. This is real important. If your wearing a medal, badge name tag with metal, gunbelt vest or even a zipper - be very careful on your readings. Even my eyeglasses disrupts a correct reading while sighting. I do not believe this is worth the money or even owning. Look to a little better quality and one that has a lock for the compass dial. That is what I am going to do..."
2,You get what you pay for,"If you truly want a military compass, go ahead and save the necessary $70 and buy a good one, perhaps ordering it from Ranger Joe's in Columbus GA. It's worth it, for a compass far more durable than this one."
2,just ok,I bought two and only one worked ok.I will make this short.Spend the money and buy a good one that works well.Amazon would not take it back because of what it is filled with.
3,Not bad quality - Good Price - Not a bet your life on product,"In general, okay to good. The accuracy is off by 1 to 2 degrees, they stuck the dial on slightly askew. Dampening - way too much, but not bad if you're mountain biking and giving it a beating. Design is good and solid, illumination is lacking a full moon is required.YOU MUST HOLD IT LEVEL - failure to do so will result in readings off by as much as 10+ degrees.In general, at less than $15, a buy. BUT, if you're serious and way out in the woods get a Cammenga."
1,POS - Not worth the box it came in!,"I bought this compass from a gun shop for 10 dollars as a gift. It dose not point north, the sight hair was loose at first then it fell out. If you are planning a hunting or hiking trip and need a compass you can trust with your life, this one is the wrong choice! You will be as good as dead if you truly need to use it! In the event you do think your life will depend on a compass try this one Cammenga Model 3H Tritium Lensatic Compass. I used it while in the army and still do. It works like it should every time, It is worth every cent."
1,"Garbage, didn't work","I bought this for my bug out bag, thinking it would work like a compass should because it had decent reviews.Well the one i got didn't work. sometimes it rotated when i turned, and sometimes it didnt...Cheap Garbage made in china crap, do not buy!"
3,Sorry it does leak,"When you first get it, it doesn't appear to leak.But eventually (after about a few weeks) it does.The one redeeming quality is that it is wide enough to fit a hand blender in if you need to whip something up.Other than that, I highly recommend the Blender Bottle as an alternative. It definitely does not leak."
5,great cups,The cups are great. They DO NOT LEAK! There is a nice little rubber seal on the rim and the cap closes securely.
2,Design flaw,Not bad but I find it very difficult to screw the lid on without cross-threading it. Sometimes when I think I have finally got it right I'll start shaking it and liquid will fly all over the kitchen. This problem did not occur immediately so maybe the material breaks down over time.
5,Good for lots,"I got this by recommendation from my Weight Watchers leader to mix my smoothies in when I don't have time to crack out the blender. Works great for that, good seal, no foul odor as there is with many plastic drink containers. I would definitely recommend."
1,Leaks!,"For everyone that has used shakers and haates the leaking...walk away from this product. It leaks from the moment it is used, and then the moment it comes out of the dishwasher...every crack is filled with water! Wished I hadn't bought it!"
4,Historically Correct - Based on 1920's murder,"In many of the reviews for Double Indemnity, you will find it called a novel or a fiction piece. In reality, James Cain wrote Double Indemnity about the 1920's murder case of Ruth Snyder and Judd Gray, who together killed Snyder's wealthy husband. Billy Wilder made it into a film and a broadway play. Richard Schiekel also wrote a mystery based on the story. Snyder's trip to the electric chair was one of the most famous executions of the century, because a photographer strapped a camera to his ankle and photographed Ruth Snyder in the chair as the current surged through her body. It then was published on the front of The New York Daily News and became a most famous photo of the decade."
4,Noir Classic,"First time I have read this, even though it is one of my favorite film stories. The book is very good but not nearly the masterpiece that is the screenplay."
5,Cain Kills With This One,"Absolutely incredible! Cain writes a clean and crisp story containing multiple plot twists to keep you guessing. My first ""crime/fiction"" novel I've read in a while and it was well worth my time. The book is fairly small yet it still packs a huge wallop of detail and intensity. This is the kind of book that can draw you to be infatuated with that genre in which it came from. Those who read this will not be able to put it down until the last line of Cain's irresistible prose."
3,Double Indemnity,"Murphy LeeMay 22, 2002Double IndemnityBy James M CainThe book Double Indemnity, by James M Cain is a mystery about an old man, Mr. Nirlinger, who is murdered by his second wife, Phyllis Nirlinger, and insurance agent, Mr. Huff. Mr. Nirlinger's daughter, Lola, was just an innocent person who has many suspicions about Phyllis. This story has many twist's and one is when we find out the truth about the first Mrs. Nirlinger's death. This book is brain candy for those who love mysteries, as for those who like regular novel's I would not recommend this book. If you are looking for an interesting twist on what you would normally read than read this book because if you are very open minded you will consider this book somewhat worth the read. As for me I did not like the book but I would recommend it for people who like mysteries and those who just want to open there spaces, you might just enjoy it."
3,mrs nirdlinger ...and mr huff her victim,Double Imdemnity by James M.Cainit is love at first sight Mrs nirdlinger is in love with Mr Huff.Mrs Nirdlinger and Mr Huff the insurence agent plain to kill Mr Nirdlinger so they make up this big plain to kill him on a train but insted Mr Huff kills him in the car and they make it look like he fell off the train and commited suicide.the part of the book that stood out to me was when we found out that Mrs Nirdlinger killed six people before Mr Nirdlinger.when we first started reading the book i did not like it but then i got in to it and i liked it. the book made me want to read on. I would recomend this book to highschool kids and middle school kids.
2,The things people do for money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,... I liked this novel even though i'm not into reading mysteries but I really recommend this novel to all. 5 star's!!!!!!!!
3,Meh,"This is an easy read, not over- the top with archaic words as these old noir books usually are. Interesting story with a strange, disappointing ending. Good, not great. But I've been spoiled by Raymond Chandler's books."
4,Double Indemnity,"This is the third book I've read by James Cain, and I can say that I wasn't disappointed. A few good unexpected twists in this one. Cain's books remind me of sitting with my dad when I was young and watching the old black and white classic movies on TV. If you enjoy those, you will like this book."
5,FANTASTIC Safety Gate!,"This gate is amazingly easy to install. I wanted a pressure-mount gate so it could easily moved to different locations in the house, and this one is PERFECT! The auto-close feature is also wonderful. My 5 year old doesn't have to put much effort into making sure the gate is closed, to keep her baby sister safe!I highly recommend this gate!"
2,Why???????????,"Why are kids singing beatles songs. Most kids don't even like them, anyway. The beatles aren't innapropriate, so they could have just put the original songs on a cd. I only gave this cd 2 stars because they're better than kidz bop."
5,Essential for maintenance of older German cars.,"While the main focus is on air-cooled Volkswagens, the book's utility goes far beyond this. The section on fuel injection covers both the early D-Jetronic and later L-Jetronic Bosch injection systems - which were used on several other makes of cars, including BMW, Mercedes, and Volvo. Since the book is aimed at maintenance/troubleshooting without the factory test equipment, test values for common multimeters are given, as well as a logical troubleshooting flow and terminal connections. I found this section to be the best (perhaps the only) available reference for Bosch D-Jet fuel injection."
4,"I love the book , will own one to refer to before 1998.","The book is self explanatory. I have checked this bookout of the library twice. I figured after that, might as wellnot be a hog and buy a copy of it. I will buy one before1997 is over and I ain't gonna steal it"
2,I wonder why it is so popular?,"As a mechine designer and VW bug owner, I have found many places in the book wrong, or not good as a direction for maintain your bug, How come an idiot book without enough drawings or pictures could be instructive, John has uesed too much sense of feeling,If it is a book discussing scientific hypothesis, I will have no comment, but if it is for complete idiot, It has to be 100% correct based on practical design and applications, with materials that does't falter, If you buy this book, better you have an official manual beside,"
4,Nice,"Very pleased with unit and warranty, does what it should do. Have become a repeat buy of this companies products."
4,Very good surge protector,"Now all my router, cable modems, voip gatemway, and USB fan are all connected to this surge protector.Few months back I lost one voip gateway due to some electric surge and I decided/researched to purchase Tripp Lite TLP810NET because of their expertise in this domain."
5,So Far So Good,"I have all my home theater components hooked up to this surge protector. Believe it or not, I went half a year before realizing I was playing it unsafe. Picked this up from amazon for a good price. If ever i get a spike and it doesn't work, i'll come back and edit this review :)"
5,Computer protection,"The Tripp Lite Surge protector was shown on previous reviews as an excellent product. Due to long distances from power plants to our service area, there are frequent surges in the lines. Even more so, there are often low voltage events. Lightning storms in the late summer and even in the spring cause surges in voltage. This makes the necessity for protection a very real concern. This is my second Tripp Lite product. The first one only had four outlets which was not enough for computer, monitor, printer, telephone, and miscellaneous items. The product has worked well so far. This product has been in use about one month."
5,Best Suppressor for the money,"This is by far the best suppressor for the money. I've learned so much by researching how suppressors work. 99% of the public has no idea that each time a surge hits your suppressor, the amount of protection left in the suppressor is reduced. Most people think that their surge protectors will last forever. NOT! Having one with both audible and visual warnings is a must. You cant't go wrong with this product. I bought one to my son as well.Rusty R., Richmond, VA"
1,Dead from the start,"I could not return this item because it was too late to return. Why? When I purchased it, I purchased it as a backup surge protector in case the current one got fired. Well, the first one did get fried --all plugged-in devices were fully protected; different manufacturer--, and that is when I opened the package for this item. It never turned on. I did try it in other electrical outlets, but nothing. Darn thing was already dead. Once I received a replacement product from a different manufacturer, it worked (is still working) perfectly fine--same electrical outlet. I can only suspect that someone bought it, fried it, returned it, and then I was the lucky recipient of it. Lesson learned... once a product arrives, do not wait to make sure it works properly. --daca"
2,Outlets very close together.,"This surge protector will work if all your plugs are of conventional size. I have an air conditioner and timer plug that are fairly large, and cover more than their own outlet. As a result, I am returning this product. A design flaw in my opinion, and not reflected accurately in the picture."
2,It does the job,"I researched this purchase pretty carefully. Some surge suppressors are rated too low (Joules) or offer too many bells and whistles for too much money. This one seemed to offer a good balance of price and features and a solid connected-equipment guarantee. A component-styled unit would have been even better, but wasn't worth the price difference to me. It's hard to tell just how good a surge suppressor is until something goes wrong, but so far so good."
5,review,"Tripp Lite TLP810NET Protect It! Surge Protector/Suppressor 8 outlets (3 Transformers) 10ft Cord 3690 JoulesGreat product so far. Just purchased, like it and the price especially the warranty, can't beat it."
5,Fine so far,Looks good and has all the plug-ins I needed. Quality appearance and feels solid. But how do you know if it works? Better safe than sorry is my motto ....
4,Great product,No problems. We have hid this surge protector for quite some time and it has not failed us. Plenty of outlets for devices.
5,Seems to be a quality product for the price,"Fast shipping, exactly as described. Seems to be a quality product at a low price."
3,Warrenty not as advertised,"When you read the fine print on this suppressor's warranty, it is different from the advertisement. The way I read it, the warranty does not cover your equipment by lightning strikes. You're only protected by line surges, that gives them an out, they can always say it was lightning. The only way to actually be safe is to unplug the thing during storms, and it's hard to plug and unplug, the offset plug is a pita. I bought two of these and after reading the warranty haven't even used them. It's better to just use my old power strips, they're easy to unplug during storms."
2,Not One of Hugh Masekela's Best,"It's wonderful that this oustanding musician is still active at 60! I love Masekela's trumpet and musicianship, but this album is disappointing. The trumput sound has aged well, but Masekela's voice, which lacks any subtlety and resonance, is overpowering on this album.I agree with david-smedley (reviewer) that the instrumental tracks are the best on the album, but the vocal tracks dominate. I just know a few of Hugh's albums, but I do find ""Hope"" and ""Beatin Aroun de Bush"" much more appealing."
2,Sonoran Desert Plants: An Ecological Atlas,"I was highly disppointed with the content of the book. It may be a very complete and usable book from a scientific stantpoint, however as a book for the ""amateur"" botanist to use to study and identify Sonoran plants it is much too scientific. The use of listing by genus and species definitely marks it as an educational book not a book for use by the general public. The lack of colored pictures of the plants is also unfortunate. I think the online discription of the content of the book makes it very hard to ascertain the actual purpose of the text. It would be informative if it was somehow noted that this book is not a ""field guide""."
2,Really wanted to rate it better...,"At first I loved this bag. It was exactly the size I thought it would be hand carried everything I needed just right. It wasn't ""perfect"", but nothing ever is. After the first and second day of use I'd have rated it a 4.5/5 stars. Then the third day I noticed that all the running around with the bag had caused the dye to rub off on my shorts, temporarily staining them. I was, understandably, upset. After washing my shorts and the bag, the shorts were fine but the bag had basically run and the dye had come out of the bag in streaks. This lead to an almost 'camouflage' look but with the wrong colors - the color of the bag, a faded version of that color, and an off white (the natural color of the fabric. The bag was washed with just soap in cold water, so that to be screams 'bad'. I'll be returning this item for a full refund. I'll give it another chance with the replacement, but I'm going to soak it in cold water overnight before using."
1,Poor Quality,"I got this messenger bag about a month ago and have been using it daily. It's roomy and comfortable, and works fine for carrying the small amount of stuff that I need for work. After using it for 6+ weeks, the stitching on one of the arms has begun to come apart. This is very dissappointing based on the excellent reviews that the bag has received and since I use it very lightly. It's on my shoulder maybe 10 minutes per day and I've been carrying 5-7 lbs. of stuff at most. Maybe I can try sewing it perhaps. The price is very low, so maybe sometimes you do get what you pay for. Beware of this product!"
4,What Can I Say? Its Green and it's Cotton Canvas,"It is simple, but efficient. It has a large main compartment, two on either end and two in the front. It also has a small zippered pocket on the inside near the top."
4,Just what I wanted,I was tired of carrying a shoulder bag every day to work so I got this so my hands are free. Going to sew some large magnets to keep the flap closed or glue/sew some snap closures. Until then I just turn in so the flaps on the inside close to my body.
4,Great bag!!!,"Great product, fast shipment! well worth the money. I plan on getting my older brother one as well! I got it for a diaper bag for myself and has worked out great!"
5,Just What I ordered,I was looking for a sturdy shoulder bag to carry my iPad and assorted things in when I came across this bag and it turned out to be everything I was looking for. It is well constructed out of heavy canvas fabric and has just the right amount and size pockets that a person needs. I would definitely order this item again.
3,"Decent, but surprisingly overrated","This bag is alright, but I'm pretty surprised by how overrated it is here.Good:Cheap, seems decently durable, good sizeBad:The stitching on the bottom is really bunched up, making it have an almost more round than square base. This makes the bag sit a little strangely...The Velcro on the base of the bag is far too high, making it useless unless the bag is completely stuffed full of junk.Finally, the top flap doesn't completely cover the main opening, allowing rain to easily enter and pool in the bag. Not at all weather-proof.That said, these are all pretty small gripes, but do definitely prevent me from REALLY liking the bag."
2,Good while it lasts...,"This bag, while great at what it does, is not very durable. The straps fray at the metal brackets and something will eventually give... my strap just broke today. The metal bracket has a joint that is unprotected and wears away at the fabric of the bag or the strap.If you're looking for something that lasts more than a year, avoid this product."
5,Get it.,"I don't know if it's just me, but this roomy (but not too roomy) bag is just perfect. Form-factor is amazing, it looks nice, can be masculine or feminine (I'm a guy) and just wow. Perfect for toting around my MacBook Air plus lots of peripherals and junk. Also books.Anyway, see title."
3,Kinda huge and floppy,"It came when it said it would come... but it doesn't really look like the picture at all. It's really big and floppy. The material is great, and it would make a great overnight bag, but its kind of too awkward and clumsy to be an everyday bag. =/"
4,Good for what it is but could be just a little bit better...,"I purchased this bag as an alternative to a backpack for carrying items between the garage and my desk at work. For this purpose it works very well. The bag is light weight but very roomy allowing me to carry my newspaper, large desk folio and even my laptop PC. The quality of materials and workmanship are surprisingly good for an item of such a low price point.The only real drawback I have found is that the main compartment has no provision for securing contents other than the top flap of the bag which is secured only by velcro. It would be nice for the bag to have a zipper on the main compartment to prevent contents from spilling out should the bag be upturned.Overall this bag suits my purposes perfectly at a very reasonable price so I would not hesitate to recommend it."
1,Not as durable as advertised,"I had this bag for a total of 6 weeks. I never had more than my laptop and one spiral bound notebook in it, and the stitching along the bottom of the bag (that keeps everything in) came loose and made a huge hole in the bottom. I wasn't overly rough with it and there was no trauma to it. I only used it to carry my laptop and notebook to class. Shortly after that, all of the stitching came out of one side where the strap was attached to the bag. I gave up trying to repair it and bought a bag from a different brand. Do not buy this item."
3,IF YOU'RE SMALL...,"I'm 5'3 and weigh around 110 pounds, and as all small people know, a big bag doesn't look good on a small person. I thought I had made an educated decision since I saw so many people liked the bag. However, I didn't take into consideration that so many people liking it was actually a bad thing, because most people are average sized, and for something to fit good on me, I should be seeing reviews saying ""this bag is too small!"" Luckily, my father knows how to stitch things, so he'll be making my book bag smaller by adding elastics.Apart from that, the book bag looks fine! It's darker than the picture and I ordered with Ace Mart on Thursday and got it today, Wednesday, six days later :)"
2,BAD QUALITY,Well the bag looks good and the size/pockets are perfect but the material is very rough. I remember walking around with it and getting my legs bruised. I got it washed a few times and then the thread came off. Since then I have not used the bag. Must give it one more try.
1,useless bag,"this is one of the worse bag i ever brought. the color is so disgusting, and nasty. the bag is already ripped out.i don't recommend anyone to buy this bag. don't buy it and save your money. this bag is useless and crack."
4,My thoughts.,"I received this bag the day of the estimated order, which is a plus. The color is great, looks just like the picture. I wanted this bag bag because I want something different for school. I use a laptop, and it fits thank god. The bag is slightly heavy while carrying the laptop (nothing else is in it). I have a feeling that things will be cramped in the bag, there's not that much room from what I can tell. Other than that, I am so happy with this purchase. I love it!"
5,Wonderful Bag!,I use this bag to carry my laptop and accessories. The two front pockets are perfect for cords and external hard drives. It was exactly what I expected it to be. I just throw on my laptop sleeve and shove it in the bag and go!
4,Just what I wanted,"This bag is very roomy with a good number of pockets and slots for various items that you might carry. The structure is very pliable, so it takes the shape of what you are packing. It appears to be very sturdy. I have packed it with a couple of fairly heavy items and there doesn't appear to be any significant stress.I carry a brief case for work, but I use this bag to carry stuff back and forth from office to home. It is just what I wanted."
2,"Fairly Heavy, Fairly Floppy, Wrong Color","I can see how this might be a useful bag for some. For everyday use, I think it's fairly heavy (especially with a book or two inside), and flops around/flops open. The color was a medium to dark grey, rather than the dark green/olive in the description. There were also two snags in the fabric on the front - I'm sure they're inevitable, but I'd prefer to start clean and do my own snagging.I've returned this produc."
5,"Great bag, excellent value","I am a person who frequently pays top dollar for items of high quality.Though I certainly wish the material quality of this bag was a bit better, it is still more than worth the price.I have several bags that I use for college, from makers ranging from 'Fossil' to 'Kakadu', but this one gets twice as much use as all the rest.It will hold my computer, notebook, and textbook perfectly.Extremely valued by me, I will most certainly buy another in the near future."
4,Exactly what I ordered,Looks good. Haven't used it much yet but it is exactly as shown. Velcro looks to be about the worst part as other reviews have stated and ill have to be careful it doesn't flip open on my commute. Otherwise I was looking for a casual work bag and that's exactly what I got. Quality seems good considering the price.
4,nice bag,"nice bag, it is the one I take to college with my heavy books or my laptop. i love that color..!!!"
2,Good but faded really fast,"This is a great, amazing bag and sturdy, comfy, everything. The only problem with it is that it faded pretty quickly. I don't take it in the sun ever, not at all, but it did fade a lot. I don't know why. Anyway, this faded look would be just fine if I were a guy and could hang with a more rugged look, but I'm a female teacher and kind of think it looks grungy. I like the bag though and still use it sometimes."
3,Only lasted one trip,"I took it to my Europe trip, and at the end of it, it got yellow because of sunlight. I had to throw it away."
5,Great Bag for School,"I bought this bag because I needed to haul my laptop to class. The bag is great. It gets tons of compliments you can fit a laptop, the cables and a textbook and a notebook in there comfortably."
5,"A good, sturdy bag","Really like this bag. Enough pockets, roomy, without being overly bulky. I like that its relatively lightweight, as well. Good ""trekking"" bag for when I'm schlepping around the city or the ballpark or the trail (not good for real hiking, of course, but perfect for a day out at the park). I'm a 5'3"" female, and though this bag is probably a bit big for my body size, I really appreciate the utilitarian nature of it. Good purchase."
3,Pretty Unimpressed,"While this bag has, so far, served it's purpose, it's not what I expected. I received the heavy-weight messenger bag in black, which wasn't the color I ordered. I've been using it about a month and has held up very well with very little signs of wear. My typical load includes carry a 17"" laptop, a hefty fundamentals of nursing book, a notebook and binder. It all fits well but the bag doesn't have a lot of shape to it. If I'm not carrying something kind of large, the bag kind of wants to fall open. The inside isn't impressive either. The VERY small inside zippered pocket has a hole in from a pencil and it just flops around. I'm debating just cutting it out.I was really excited when I saw a messenger bag like this for such a cheap price, but I got what I paid for."
5,"Great product, arrived promptly",Product arrived well before the estimated delivery date which was great. Boyfriend loves the bag and it was exactly the one he wanted.
5,Great bag at a Great price,"I gave this to my daughter for Christmas and she says it is a perfect bag for her. Her laptop fits in it along with her normal purse items and books. She loves all the pockets and the easy access to the inside. At the price I paid, it was a great gift!"
4,Praise Be to Reverand Green,"If you like Al Green, you'll like this Christmas album. He puts his signature spin on the classics."
4,"good book, lots of bugs","Go to Adobe site to download the errata. You can also download the book if want.It has been reorganized to make it self-contained and more readable. However, lots of bugs (some are documented in the errata) occurred durring the transition. I tend to believe that the PDF 1.3 spec of March 11 1999 has less bug, albeit preserving the old chapter layout.Also note that since Acrobat 5.0 is out, there would be a PDF 1.4 spec with JBIG2 support. Maybe the Acrobat 5.0/PDF 1.4 would mature after a while.Overall, it's a better book after the restructuring."
1,Nasty Environmental Pollutant,"At the opera this evening I sat next to a woman wearing a scent so overpowering it made my eyes water and my throat burn. I'd never had such a reaction to a scent before and so, at the end of the performance, I asked her what she was wearing. Her embarrassed answer: Flowerbomb."
1,Old lady,Did not like from the first spray. I wore it out and my sister made the comment that someone was wearing old lady perfume.
1,flower bombed,I do not know what the big fuss is all about. This perfume is not all it is cracked up to be. I detested the smell.
5,Everyone Asks What I'm Wearing!,This fragrance is phenominal. When I wear this perfume everyone compliments me. It is feminine but not too sweet. It has usurped every other cologne in my cabinet and can be worn to the office or out for the evening. The scent has a touch of a spicey scent and by no means do you feel that you are a walking garden. Saks told me it was their number one selling parfum. I give it a strong five stars.
1,"fake ,fake,fake !!!!!","do not buy this product from here it is definetely fake .i have been using flower bomb for years now ,so i ordered two bottles .but i knew once i received the package they perfume were fake ,smelled them it was pure alcohol.do not waste your money ordering them from here ,buy only from sephora or departement store."
1,This Flowerbomb BOMBED!,"This is my very favorite perfume....I love it. But I really believe this product is OLD, the color is dark & it smells not like it should. If I can find my paperwork I am going to try to send it back, for $99.00 is was no bargain, like I thought it would be. I should had known, when I opened the perfume box, the inner box was torn & the perfume bottle was sideways, like it was opened & sent back previously...so disappointed."
4,flowerbomb,"Bought this small version due to cost to make sure I liked it. I love it. It is a light flowery sent, not like any other."
1,FAKE.,"I would NOT recommend buying this product! The barcodes are cut off and stickers are placed over some of them. The perfume was loose in the box when I received it and looked like it had been repackaged (the cardboard was bent in odd places and the clear wrap was already coming off). The scent does not last as long when compared to the 'same' perfume at Nordstrom, it smells different by the end of the day and is more sugary than flowery. It's disappointing to see that Amazon would sell something that isn't real, but they definitely did. If you want this perfume, definitely buy it from an authorized dealer such as Nordstrom or Sephora. Nordstrom will even match the Amazon price. DO NOT BUY IT ON AMAZON."
3,Knock off,"I did not realize when I purchased this perfume that I was getting a knock off version!!! Although its smells nice, its not the original!! The bottle is shaped different too..I'm disappointed.."
1,baby powder scent,I think this is the most deceptive title for a perfume period. It really smells like baby powder. I got this from the perfumania sale after having it on my amazon wish list for ages. just to realize this thing really is no better smelling than baby powder. Fell for the hype. I paid a lot of money to discover this. My kids play with this and I don't even mind it any more.
5,My favorite scent!,I love this fragrance! I always get so many compliments when I wear it. I ordered the actual spray perfume first and then decided I had to order a rollerball to stay fresh throughout the day. I can't imagine switching anytime soon.
4,"Really love the scent, very nicely packaged!","The scent is like a flower explosion, not over powering just with the person next to you. The presentation is impressive. It would make a great Christmas present. Love it! Gprincess"
1,Too Good to be True,"Soon after I got this product, I noticed that the color was off. It was a beigy pink, instead of light pink. It also does not smell like Flowerbomb. I would not recommend this product."
4,"Small bottle, but perfume lasts","The title pretty much says it all. It's a small bottle, but the perfume is long lasting. I do not like how there isn't an applicator for the perfume though."
1,Misprint?,Suggested retail 70-100.00 this company has to have made a mistake and I hope there not trying to take advantage of people by trying to sell this over 800.00's
5,Lasts forever!,"I got first saw this purfume in Glamour Magazine I believe and it had a free sample in it so I wore it around for a day and thought to myself that I really liked it so I asked for it for christmas. Upon recieveing it for christmas, I fell in love. It lasts forever and I can smell it all day. I wore it to work and by the end of my long day, I STILL smelled it on my sweater! I have never had a purfume that has lasted this long and not to mention the scent it so unique and original."
1,SHOULD HAVE TRIED IT AT THE COSMETIC COUNTER PRIOR TO BUYING.,"I'M SURE PEOPLE WHO LIKE THIS WOULD FIND IT WONDERFUL...I COULD BARELY GIVE IT AWAY AS NO ONE LIKE HOW IT SMELLED ON THEM. GUESS I LEARNED A LESSON...NOT THE FAULT OF THE VENDOR, BUT MY OWN."
5,Very Satisfied,"I received my perfume today and am very satisfied. Some of the previous Amazon reviews concerned me, but my package arrived and everything was in tact. The perfume is authentic, not a knockoff. I compared it to the sample I received from Nordstroms. The only thing missing was the sticker inside of the box, so I won't receive any promotional material. But this isn't a huge concern being that I saved over $50.00. So pleased!!!!!!!"
3,Flower Bomb is not the Bomb I expected,"I like the fragrance and wear it everyday because I paid a lot for it.It does not smell like the sample sprayed on the card that I was given in the store and carried in my purse for days and still enjoyed!!!!. It is not one that you spray on and say, ""I love this perfume."" I am very disappointed for the price. No one ever complients me on it nor can I smell it on myself ever during the day."
4,aromas,"a drop goes a long way....to add more ""life"" to the aroma, i put a little bit of baby oil on my skin prior to putting on FB. then the perfume lasts longer b/c it absorbs more of the scent...just a little trick"
5,Outstanding fragrance -- DEF a Winner!,I purchased this perfume for my mother and she LOVES it! Holds up well while not being overwhelming. Easy transaction!!
5,bold and beautiful,"Fragrance reviews are hard to write since they're so personalised, but the least I can say is that Flowerbomb is a relatively strong fragrance (moderate sillage), and quite longlasting (over 6 hours on me). It's a very sweet, warm floral, with a bit of a sharp osmanthus (sort of citrus, plummy) top note and a musky sweetness on drydown. I quite like it, though it might not suit all tastes."
1,FAKE PERFUME,"I wanted to get this for my girlfriend for new years. I placed my order on December 21st and received the item on January 2nd. I could tell the box plastic had been taped back to the box, after opening it I saw more evidence that this perfume was fake. It doesn't even smell like flower bomb. I hope amazon will refund the money.DON'T BUY IT! FAKE ITEM."
2,it's hopeless,"My hubby walked by me after I dabbed some of the perfume on and commented ""that smells like an old lady."" not quite the response I was hoping for from him. I waited for the dry down hoping the scent would somehow beautify itself on me, but alas it's hopeless. Headache inducing and strong. Would not recommend."
5,Product Code Removed From Box,"I love this perfume, have been wearing it for about two years now. I discovered it from one of those perfume inserts inside a magazine.Inside the package was a flyer that said to go to their website, enter the code from inside the top flap of the box, for special gifts, offers, etc. from Victor & Rolf. Someone had already opened my box, removed the code (looks like they took a razor and cut out the paper from the lid where the code was supposed to be,) then re-sealed the box.I don't know why someone would take the time to do that, but other than that, the perfume itself is fine."
3,Flower Bomb,"It is good with its strong smell but not have the true one:( Before I bought it, I read most of the reviews but I didn't love it actually. Depending on the good expressions, it should be wonderful but it is not. Even it has a strong smell, it does not stay long on the body. Maybe it is not suitable for me and does not match with my body nature I don't know but next time I will switch to a new brand.."
1,"I don't think the perfume is the original flowerbomb, I think it is a knockoff","I really would like a refund for this product, I tried the flowerbomb at Nordstrom and liked it, The one I received from Amazon does not smell the same and the cap doesn't fit right and the small black circle on the bottle does not have the flower on it. I have thrown the box away but I would like a refund. This purfume definately does not meet the standards of the one I tried at Nordstrom.Thank-you,Shelly Olson"
2,Old Perfume,"I have previously purchased my Flowerbomb at Nordstrom. It smelled wonderful and I always received lots of compliments when I wore it. This new bottle that I purchased through Amazon doesn't smell the same. It smells like it sat around too long and got old. I probably shouldn't have tried to save money on this product. I still spent $100.00. Oh well, live and learn."
4,Great scent!,"Love this scent. It is perfect to wear everyday. Sexy and subtle, lasts throughout the day into evening."
1,not worth the price,"I got a sample of this perfume thru the mail and I loved it. Oh, it smelled so lovely and had the most beautiful notes in it... So I bought it. I really felt that it's a little more than I usually pay for perfume, but it was nice stuff!! WRONG! I'm so sorry to have to say that this perfume completely disappears from my skin in 10 minutes. I mean, there's not a trace of the scent! I'm quite confounded actually. I can't believe that I spent $80 for a bottle of perfume that I literally have to carry around with me and spray it every 1/2 hour or so. :(I'm so sad... I now know why Viktor and Rolf only have this one perfume to offer. It's a good scent but come on guys, it needs some tweaking."
3,Not Impressed,"The shipping was quick. The packaging is great, but the smell is just so-so.I read all great reviews about this perfume so I had to buy it, but when I received it -was not impressed. Soft and good smell, but I wouldn't necessarily call it a unique or outstanding. It doesn't stay long. Not impressed."
5,her second favorite xmas gift,I got this as a stocking stuffer... She mostly like the way the bottle looked online but not that she has it she loves the way it smells too...
2,Too sweet,"It's just a matter of personal preference but this perfume is too sweet for me. I'll go back to my Chanel No, 5."
4,Beautiful but pricey,"Great product, smells amazing. Super expensive however. Luckily I found a good price on Amazon and saved about 25% over the mall."
3,"Good book , BUT THIS IS IDENTICAL TO THE 1st BOOK","I just want to make other buyers beware that THIS IS the 1st book , titled ""Cooking with two fat ladies""I ordered it because I thought it was a different book.It just has a different cover and title.If you liked the show, you'll enjoy the book. However, the recipes list ingredients as a ""dash"", a ""dollop"", etc.There are no exact measurements given, so you ought to have some experience with cooking, and be able to tell when the consistency and amount looks and feels right."
3,show me love,"This is a cute, somewhat tragic young coming out story....Probably better suited to a younger audience but a good film nonetheless."
5,See This Movie Or Die Unfullfilled,"When i first got this flick in the mail, i figured it'd just be cool to see once or twice, no biggie. Once again, i was wrong. This is prolly the best movie i have seen all year. the cast was amazing, direction was much better then any american film i have seen commercialy released sind Hitchcock and the plot was very involving. Besides, thoese girls were SOOOO damned cute."
5,My Favorite Movie of All Time,"Show Me Love is, simply put, one of the finest films to ever hit the screen. A well-written and natural film, it feels less like a movie and more like a documentary. There are so many instances where you feel as though the characters feel. Dahlstrom and Liljeberg are perfect and have an amazing chemistry. The supporting actors hold their own, especially Ralph Carlsson's performance as Agnes' father. Simply put, you may never find a better film about teenagers, or a better film, period.[...]"
5,Best Lesbian Movie I've seen so far,"Even with the subtitles, which I usually find annoying, this is hands down the best Lesbian movie I've seen. It beats anything we've filmed in the States, and takes Better than Chocolate because of its re-watchability. The end is happy, the shame is minimal, and the bitchy girls get their due."
5,Awesome,"This is my favorite foreign film. It's a simple Swedish love story. The simplicity is the best part and it captures the liveds of teenagers well. The ending was a little weak, but the film as a whole was great. I could watch it over and over again."
2,Slow pace and unsympathetic leads doom this teasing film,"Neither of the teen-aged heroines has a spark of humanity. They are robotic avatars of stereotyped lesbian teens, and are manipulated by the writer and director into a totally unbelievable coming out moment that makes them feel triumphant--an absurd and silly attempt at resolution of serious problems. Before that the film drags as the two girls try and fail to make satisfying relationships with their peers."
4,Enjoyed the teen angst and love story,"I have to admit I am a fan of foreign films. Mainly for the snapshot into another country's idealized (for film) culture. That beingsaid, I really enjoyed the confusion and the 'popular' girl defying the clique. Sexual ambiguity and discovery is a part of everyone's childhood and though it is far in my past, I captured a bit of the feel in the film. The quality is not that good but I really enjoyed theactors. You can substitute any issue for the lesbian feelings but the emotions captured were heartfelt."
4,a touching gem,"this movie is wonderful and heartfelt. Not only are the characters truly believable, the dialogue is very true to life. This film has become one of my favorites because of it's originality. Not many films can touch on the subject of homosexuality and adolescence without seeming too dramatic or over the top and unreal. While the scenario is common in certain adolescent movies, the entire film has a truly unique feel to it. From the type of camera used, to the situations present throughout, this movie is honestly a remarkable work of art."
2,Didn't like it,"I think I'm quite possibly the only person who truly dislikes this film. Both main characters annoy me. I really don't like either of them, and I don't see anything ""real"" about their relationship. Maybe I'm overly cynical, but I saw it as two girls with a shallow relationship which wouldn't last two weeks. I should probably watch it again, since everyone likes it so much, and see if I missed something, but honestly, I wouldn't recommend anyone watching it the first time."
3,Does everything have to take forever?,"A good idea stretched out with lots of useless filler. The main character is good, very together, but has almost no dialogue when she could have been so much more insightful and interesting. The rest of the cast is typical and cardboard. Who writes these things?The story is a 43 minute television flick, not a movie. Film is grainy, not very professional. If you get it as part of your Prime membership,okay. Don't buy it.If you're curious because it's lesbian, there are tons of more interesting lesbian flicks on porn sites. This is a few quick kisses and a load of teen angst. The denouement is hand holding and a sappy song. I don't understand why 99% of lesbian flicks are so lame. Girl doesn't understands her feelings, girl comes along who does, they become friends, then argue, scenes of suffering alone, then get together. We are way past the point where lesbians have to be angst ridden nail biters. Quit portraying women, gay or not, as paralyzingly insecure."
3,Show Me Love,"It all depends on what you are expecting from this movie. It is a light drama about two girls who take you through their adolescent emotions and experiences, while they are searching for their real identities. Great to see how in some advance societies these characters are allowed to stand up to their peers and families with a shin up and be who they are."
4,Anges=me in high school haha,"So a lesbian girl with no friends falls in love with one of the popular girls at school. Wild chaos ensues lol.Does a great job showing the awkwardness and loneliness of being gay in high school. Also addresses gay teen suicide, to a certain degree. I can't help but root for Agnes.The movie is subtitled in English. I really love the quality of the filming. Most lesbian themed movies I have watched are really low budget and campy. This one is different than any other I have watched. What's on screen appears realistic and real life.I'd recommend this to gay teens, and to anyone who wants to have an idea of coming to terms with your sexuality and how difficult it is for teens. Any gay person could relate to this movie. Any person could, if they were open to it."
4,"Ladies, show me what it's all about!","Forget what you hear about this being merely a lesbian flick; 'Show Me Love' ranks among the best coming of age stories in recent memory. The two leads take their roles with achingly real adolescent vitality, and the supporting roles of Agnes' father and the moonstruck hunk are played with warmth, devoid of cliche. While the film may come up short of complex insight into its characters, perhaps because of their age, it is on the whole a moving tale with nary a false scene. As it suggests, love may be fleeting, but if one takes the risk that Agnes or Elin does, one might find catch that elusive glimpse of the better world, or at the very least retain youthful hope, that comes only by knowing another person."
4,Imminent classic,"I loved this film and I'll probably not be the first or last person to make such a statement. Despite the grim, dull setting in a typical boring small European town, the characters are anything but. I think anyone who's ever been young, confused and in love will identify immediately. This film is destined to become a cult classic, especially with young audiences."
4,grizzled old fart,"my son from sweden came over, and what to do but to see the Van's Warped Tour? A confusing mess of a festival, we stumbled upon this band, and what did we find? A lyrical band, with every instrument fleshing out the sound. This was a refreshing find, as many other bands could not crawl out of lower registers, so murky and bottom heavy as to be indistinct and growly, with pseudo angry exhortations ringing false. Evaline was the best part of $35 spent on the whole show. Even if you pick up a used copy cheap, money well spent. I would see these guys in a heartbeat, but I'm sure not gonna travel to Turlock! Invite them to your town."
2,"A ""classic"" that is now quite archaic","Weber's book was groundbreaking when it was first published. Even today, it is considered a classic. However, the reader should be informed that Weber's book is full of white Germanic Christian bias, a bias so strong at times that it harms the author's credibility. However, if read in tandem with later works which critique it, Weber's ""Sociology of Religion"" provides a glimpse of early 20th century sociological methodology"
1,Breaks even on softer cheeses,"I really like the style and I liked the way it worked for about a week before the first one broke on mozzarella no less. I ordered it again as assumed that it had to be a fluke that the first one broke so easily. Well, we all know what we get when we assume....Apparently it wasn't a fluke just a poor (I mean HORRIBLE) idea to make the item out of plastic. This item breaks in half with little pressure. If you are looking to cut cottage cheese or camembert than this is the device for you, if not buy something else."
4,"Nice cheese slicer, good materials","This is our second cheese slicer of this material (the first one snapped in half at the handle point where the wire knob sits. I wish they made one of these out of a solid aluminum or steel block for strenght, because with my last experience I'm still a little worried about this one (you can feel the flex in it when cutting a particularly firm cheddar), but so far so good. Great consistent slices, and perfect for getting cheese ready for sandwiches or burgers in a hurry."
5,Kentucky Krankin!!,"Opening with a guitar riff more reminicent of a heavy rock anthem, this album goes a crankin'. Turn it up and hang on, this one's got to go loud. This is the album that hooked all my friends onto the Headhunters. Highlights: Title Track & Louisiana CoCo (worth it for these two alone)."
5,too much to lose,The song is great on Christmas instead of Elvis music we all listened to the CD grass string. The music is great keep up the good WORK great to have you guy's back.
2,"Started great, and then...","Well, it was a great deal, and I guess too good to be true. Once I got to about 30 discs left, every single one started to have problems, either the disc not being completed, or once completed, there were artifacts and it locks up, usually in the last 10 to 15 minutes. After 10 in a row, I tried taking one from the middle of the remaining pack, and sure enough, the same thing. I'm assuming that the rest of this pack is useless. What a waste..."
5,EXCELLENT!,"My 8X DVD burner burns these at 6X no problem! The top surface has a nice tough/rough finish which is very nice for longevity! I've burned over 30 disks so far, with no problems yet."
2,8 Defective DVDs in 25 Pack,"Be ready to get a lot of defective DVDs. At 8 DVDs in the first 25 disks that I used, 35% are defective. This means this 100 pack bundle will have 35 defective DVD's."
1,"Exhibits signs of ""DVD Rot""","There is a quality control probelm with these disks. I purchased two spindles of thse disks earlier this year to back up my movies. About 1 in 10 are now are having problems playing back. Sometimes causing the player to skip, distort, freeze or not play at all. When examining the recorded side of these discs, under strong white light, I saw specs and splotches in the recorded areas. Some of the damaged areas were so large that they looked like fingerprints, but they're not. The discs are do NOT have stick-on labels, which have been suspect to this probelm. My other experience is that many low-cost generic brands do NOT have this problem!"
2,6 defective DVDS!,OH MY GOD! I purchased these 100 pack spindle twice and I would always get 5-6 defective dvds from each spindle! But hey you can check out the Memorex website and get replacements.. It is very frustrating though to enocounter such problems like this!
1,Heed the warnings of others!,"I did not purchase these DVD's from Amazon.com, but I thought it was my duty to warn potential consumers of the poor quality of this DVD media. I had 100% failure burning on these disks! Just to ensure my new Sony DVD burner wasn't DOA, I tried a different brand- Voila!, perfect burns!. I've been reading info from other sites that CMC makes these disks and to avoid any CMC products-Period! Poor quality control seems to be the common explanation. Do some research and look for discs manufactured by Ricoh- you'll save yourself money and frustration"
1,does not work,after opening this up and trying it in my recorder after reading the disc it said no disc which my outfit says it is not compatiable with this type disc. i purchased the 50 spindle pack. my advice is to try a smaller pack first to see if it works with your outfit. this spindle also said you may have to download another program. i don't think this can be done with a recorder
1,Memorex DVD+R discs,"These are lovely discs. I love using them. This is an addendum to my prior review. Also notice, these are about 40.00 per 100 count as of Aug.2005. What a bargain!"
1,Don't Buy !!!,"I used to buy memorex for a couple of years and then I found that some of my disks were currupt, and Then I bought a Plextor Burner and I tried to use Memorex CD in it and It would just choke on it, and I called up Plextor about the problem because I also just bought a 50pack of Memorex DVD-R disks and they would not work in the burner. Plextor told me that Memorex lets air get into the ink so it causes the disks to get pitted. Plextor Recommends Verbatim,TDK,Maxell,Fujifilm, and Sony. I recommend that you spend a couple of extra dollars and and get Verbatim media."
1,DON'T BUY THESE UNLESS YOU NEED COASTERS! THEY ARE GARBAGE!!,"I bought 200 of these (2 - 100 disk Spindles) in June of 2004. The printable surface was paper. They were GREAT! I had 4 bad burns and the rest were flawless.In October I ordered 400 more (4 - 100 disk Spindles. The printable surface was white paint. Apparently, Memorex went to a different manufacturer for the new disks. THESE NEW DISKS ARE AWFUL. I HAVE THROWN AWAY ALMOST ALL OF THEM. I ESTIMATE MY SUCCESS RATE IS LESS THAN 5 OUT OF 100!!!I am outraged by this and feel ripped off. I will never buy them again. I can't take a chance ordering Disks from Amazon because I cant return them once I open the Spindle. THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS WASTED!"
1,GARBAGE,"[...] The DVD's sent out are generic, garbage DVD's. Seller advertises them as Memorex and sends out cheap generics which don't even work in DVD players. I have reported this seller to the FCC and you should too! Do not waste your money. Huge scam!It is illegal to falsely advertise your merchandise to make a quick up. You can answer to the Fraud committee now."
2,These disks are hit or miss,"I have recorded over 200 DVD+R using several different brands and have only had 2 failures. I thought I'd try the memorex because they are inexpensive and what a mistake. I have had a 30% failure rate. I thought it was my burner so I bought a new Sony and the results are the same. The disks seem to work fine as long as the finished DVD is under 3.8 Gb. I can record a movie and it will play fine until the last few minutes of the movie, then it locks up the player. I definately won't use these for any important data as they are hit or miss. I'll spend a few cents more next time and get a DVD+r that works."
1,100% Failure Rate,I burned 700 Memorex DVDs with less than 1% failures before getting a pack of these. At first I thought I was having a 50% failure rate with disks that were not finalizing. I checked out my drive and software first before trying different media. New media burned fine and I subsequently determined that even the disks that I initally thought were fine would quit playing half way through. I still recommend Memorex but not these with printable surfaces.
2,Depends which spindles you buy...,"At first, I bought a couple of 100dvd+r spindles, the ones that were not completely printable and they worked awesome. Almost 100% efficiency at 1$ a dvd. Then I purchased the ones fully printable worth .60cts each. These Stunk Big Time. I had at least a 25% failure ratio. These should be taken off the market and replace them with the more expensive ones. Suggestion, Don't buy them. You'll hate yourself."
1,Be wary of these discs,"While I'll admit that the price is right: $100 for 100 discs and that the printable surface is superb using an Epson R300 direct to cd/dvd printer... I've had many failures burning a full DVD with this particular brand. My other burns that only make use of 25 to 50% of the disc were great, no problems. It's just when I burn a DVD that has about 4.36 gigs on it that problems arise, with skipping, stuttering and sometimes complete failure to recognize the dvd from both my computer dvd drive and my set-top dvd player. In short, I can only recommend this brand if you plan on not using the outer tracks of the disc because I surmise the dye on the outer portions of the disc media is not consistent and will lead to burn and/or read failures.I recommend TDK brands at this time over Memorex brands."
5,over 300 discs with only 1 failure!!!!,Well I bought these discs when i first got my new PC with a NEC 4x dvd-rw drive... I use dvd43 and dvd decrptyer and dvd shrink. they all work real well. I AM HOWEVER UPSET THAT AMAZON ONCE AGAIN JACKED THE PRICE UP ON THESE IF YOU WANT TO FIND THEM CHEAPER GO TO WWW.TECH4LESS.COM THEY ARE 8 BUCKS CHEAPER THEN AMAZON. it breaks down to 61 cents a disc and you cant beat that!!!
3,Discs Skip on PS2,I've used the silver non-printable 4x memorex dvd+r's before with no problems on either of my players. However these printable disks have skipped every time. It's not my dvd player or burner. So I know they aren't very compatible with a PS2. I just wonder why I had no problem with the non-printable Memorex as they even have the same media code when I use DVD Identifier. Is anyone else having problems on a standalone player?
1,Memorex,Talk about junk this Memorex 4.7GB 4x DVD+R 4.7GB is the top of the line don't buy the DVD-Rs not even Best buy will sell them fujifilm DVD + R are a hole lot better and works in all stand alone players. Always look for and buy the DVD+ only
1,DVD+R 8x problems.,"I am using Memorex DVD+R 8x media in a Sony VRD-VC10 (StandAlone DVD Recorder) and the result will not play back on my DVD player (an Akai DVPS-760).Sony technical support states that they ""have had issues with Memorex media,"" and that these disks are the probable cause for my playback problem."
5,Memorex is awesome,"I got 3 pack of Memorex 4X DVD+R 4.7GB (100 Pack Spindle), I will order 3 more and they well never fail you down. They burn and play perfectly in my 2 Pioneer DVD's players and in my Toshiba laptop, So if any body are looking for a very good Blank DVD+R with a very good price he should by those.Thank You Amazon"
1,200 Disc 100+ coasters!!!!,"These are the worst disc i've ever used. Since they changed the discs to hub printable they have turned to junk. DVD Identifier recognizes these as MCC, but I had no problems with other MCC Media before or since."
1,Horrible!!!,"Terribly written! I read the entire book even though our professor only required us to read the first three chapters. He stated, ""I never would have required this book for this class but I was not involved in the writing of the syllabus."" I should have followed his instructions because I wasted an entire day reading this book."
3,"Not bad, but not great either.","Bought these for my 2007 Sequoia and they fit ok and look good.Wind noise increased with them and drove me nuts at highway speed.They do seem a bit thick where they fit into the window channel and cause problems with the windows rolling up, especially the rear windows.I took these out and installed some made by Weathertech, which can also be purchased on Amazon, that fit much better into the window channel and have not caused any issues with the windows rolling up or increased wind noise."
1,"Poor craftmanship, laughable lines, unbelievable denouement.",Bad Moon starts off okay but rapidly tries to accomplish too much with too little attention to any kind of psychological reality. The romantic dialogue sounds like it came straight from a how to write a romance novel primer and made me giggle. (I guess that is a plus.) I frequently found myself wanting to take out a red pencil and edit the book. I would hate to see anyone else spend money on this.
1,WHAT A HORRIBLE BOOK!,"If only I'd clicked onto Amazon before buying this book at my local bookstore. Ugh! It was awful. Luckily, it looks like there aren't any future Donna Julian novels headed our way!"
2,A sleeper.,"I think I was disappointed because the synopsis seemed so intriguing. I was looking forward to a good romantic suspense and instead got a mediocre murder plot and a less than satisfactory romance. The epilogue of this book tells the entire story in 4 pages while the previous 340 pages is fill. The characters of Eric and Christi are poorly developed. I couldn't feel for them. The romance between them is completely unfullfilling. In the course of about two days they fall madly in love and into bed. The author never developes a chemistry between them except for lust. The murder plot is as equally unfullfilling and less than suspensful.The killer, while not specifically indentified throughout until the end is an easy guess. Not a great reccomend for fans of suspensful romance."
3,man it's sad,another great concert ruined by it's sound. I'm sic of these Japanese farts. A short concert with a beautiful play selection. We'll just have to wait until it's released on Island/Tuff Gong.
3,Better than any Japanese Marley release,Great concert once again ruined by its sound quality. This should have been a better concert since Marley was coming to the end of his career. My favorite track on the disc is Natural Mystic. It has a good beat as well as the rest of the songs. I will wait for the Tuff Gong/Island release.
3,Way better than nothing,"What ever reviewers say here about this import's sound quality-and yeah, it's bad-at least this Japanese label cared enough to release this concert on CD. We may be waiting until who knows when for the Tuff Gong release. (I'm still waiting for Island to release Steel Pulse's amazing 1981-82 New Jersey concert). I couldn't find a clip of ""Zimbabwe"" on any album either here or at Tower. Now THAT'S really sad."
2,OK - but not specific,"This book only provides generalities about wedding planning. There aren't a whole lot of specifics, so if you are looking for great detail this book is not recommended. If you are searching for a book that will get you started for planning a wedding, such as the main tasks that you will need to undertake then this is probably a good first step for you. There are other bridal bargain books that get into the ""big picture"" as well as the details of when, where and how."
4,"Goes along the same lines as the rest of the ""Everything"" series.","Not the greatest book, but not awful either. It helped me stay on track and under budget, which is exactly what I wanted."
4,Perfect!,I purchased this book to help me and my fiance determined where we could cut costs in planning our wedding. The information was extremely helpful.I received the book with 5 days of purchase. I would order from this party again.
3,Demon! Lord! Karumba!,"Do not bother to read this unless you have read the first two books in the series, otherwise it will not make a whole lot of sense. The first half of this book is a little slow as our band of heroes is kept from pursuing Zandramas by Zaketh. Finally, they do get back on the road and the fantasy finally continues. I would give the first half of this book about a C+ and the last half a B+. I found Eddings' portrayal of Zaketh somewhat puzzling. He is the blood thirsty king bent on genocide of the Murgos. However, Garion and his friends then find him rather charming and likeable."
2,Interesting points cannot save this book,"David Eddings' continues this horrible series with the same style as before. They ride, the reader gets a boring description, the characters make bad, stale wisecracks, they learn some small bit of information, and continue on. All to fulfill a prophecy that is pretty much just like the one in the Belgarion. Every reader knows the outcome and the characters. Eddings just decides to painfully fill in the small, boring details.This time, the get kidnapped by the Mallorean Emporer, and learn about the raising of demons from one of the many random evil sorcerers placed throughout the series. Same old stuff really.There was one point of the story where Eddings' seemed to have started something interesting. He describes a plague outbreak and it's effect on a city. For twenty pages, the reader is glued to the book. But, unfortunately, the interesting sub-plot ends and the monotony continued.This book was about 400 pages, but only 10 pages mattered."
4,Eddings surpasses expectations,David Edding is a wonderful fantasy/advnture writer. The depth of his characters and his intertwined plots makes all of his books hard to put down. This series of books was one of the best yet from David Eddings. I am looking forward to see where he can lead us to next.
4,Twin Towers Rock Before 9-11,"As an avid sci-fi/action genre maven who likes special effects, I was very surprised that a low budget movie did so well in cinematography. A well written and acted script,and very good special effects lends some credibility to having a powerful earthquake in a relatively low risk zone. It was eerie seeing the Trade Center again (as so many movies do), suffer damage other than terrorist driven. The main complaint about the DVD is that it is not widescreen. Being a TV movie, one would not expect widescreen, but the jewelcase description says ""formatted to fit your TV"", thus it leads one to believe that a widescreen exists. Still, I enjoyed the film and actually believe the special effects to be better than in ""Earthquake""."
2,Pretty much what you'd expect,"Okay, to be honest, the film's a bit of a snoozer. The acting is pretty much on par for these type of films, with the Russian taxi driver's accent particularly amusing. The special effects are mediocre and mostly limited to the first half. The second half is devoted to various uninteresting characters getting rescued or in the process of dying. Again, boring and nothing you haven't seen before or better, although the ridiculousness of Sharon Lawrence's character pseudo-rock climbing her way up a ruined school building to retrieve her son was unintentionally hilarious. This did not need to be a three-hour event, and when it's over your only emotion is relief that it wasn't any longer."
1,The aged cheese of all time,"One of the craaappiest movies I have ever seen if not the craaappiest. Thats all that needs to be said here. If it were not so bad, I would actually take the time to name what makes it so bad. I would have to write a book about this one though.The only reason it has one star is because zero stars was not an option.Its beyond my understanding how anyone can give this a 5 star rating. This is the kind of stuff you see on tv and cant flip the channel fast enough away from. Rates just below the home shopping network.This is my first review of a movie after purchasing dozens of movies for years from Amazon. This movie motivated me enough to take the time out and warn people. It was that bad.The aged cheese of all time."
5,Apocalyptic thriller,An on the edge of your seat dramatic thrill seeking film. This film is an on the edge film because of the action in it that keeps the viewer glued to the set.
3,Decent made for TV movie,You have to like disaster movies to really enjoy this one. It's entertaining (if you're in the mood for a disaster drama.)
3,Just OK,"Just ok. They do not make disaster movies like they use to. The plot is great, ideas are great, but acting is terrible and scenes are terrible espeically during the earthquakes..."
5,Save The Cat,"I saved the cat and am keeping him, too! A must read for any screenwriter -- aspiring and pro. Be prepared to devour this book in one sitting.Stephen Groak"
1,"For beginners only, then discard","This is the cheesiest screenwriting cookbook out there, filled with ""rules"" that are nowhere to be found in countless great films but you can spot them very clearly in Hollywood's February releases. It offers a very shallow understanding of how dramatic stories work. For example, the opening image is apparently something REALLY IMPORTANT. What was the opening image in The Godfather? I forget. Who cares? What was important was the characters. Then pages 30-55 are ""Fun and Games"". Yeah, okay. Then there's the ""bad guys close in"" section - I suppose you can rent The Graduate and find this section followed to a T.FACE FACTS: The top screenwriters in Hollywood don't follow this formula any more than an NBA player practices his jump shot on one of those little baskets you hang over the door in your bedroom.If you want to write a first script, try his method. If nothing else, it's one way to try and write. But as you get better, you will realize this is grade school stuff."
5,Great book,He really breaks down everything into a simple formula that makes sense and mashes you realize things that you might never have realized otherwise.
5,"Fun, Easy Read that Spells Out Hollywood Storytelling in an Enjoyable Format","This book was the first book in a long time that surpassed my initial expectations. I didn't know anything about Script writing and that industry, but Blake Snyder spells it out in an entertaining and humerous book. I didn't find his style obnoxious or condescending at all. It's tongue-in-cheek and cheers you on--like any good teacher would. I have all three books in the trilogy and I say, ""Two paws up"" for Save the Cat!"
3,simple good advice and nothing more,"This book contains alot of good advice for screenplay writing. however, the book is really aimed towards making ""family films"". all the movies he references are family films, and sometimes his own. It is a good book to get yourself in the right mindset for writing a screenplay but you can't rely on it to much or you might find yourself writing really dumb kids movies like ""Blank Check"". The process he gives you is very formulaic and his approach is more toward making money. but overall good read and good information. and who knows, maybe if you follow his advice to the point you could sell a screenplay to Spielberg for a million dollars too!"
3,"not bad, not all that great","not a bad book on screenwriting, but it doesn't stand apart from the dozen or so other books i've read on the subject. the best one i've read is ""Screenwriting Tricks of the Trade"" by William Froug"
2,The Last Book On Screenwriting you should EVER buy,"Read Kingseyeland's review for an accurate review of this book. I also flicked through the book at a bookstore. Let me say the title is very misleading. Aside from tips about how to sum up a film in a sentence (the log-line), the book didn't offer much. I also thought Snyder stuck the boot into the film Memento unfairly. Momento is mentioned in various film study books due to its creative editing and manipulation of narrative structure. Snyder's barbs just sounded bitter. Really, Snyder wrote (and freely admits to writing) ""Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot"". Is that the voice of wisdom? Log-line for this book: Old hack writer name drops incessantly and attacks independent films whilst offering little to no original information himself. Do yourself a favour and go and purchase a better book on this subject."
5,The most useful resource out there,"I've taken three month-long screenwriting seminars, one at USC, and read countless other books on the craft. This one gave me the specific, practical, actionable advice that I needed to get my work to a professional level.Reading this book is like being jacked into the Matrix's insta-learning program. Suddenly you know kung fu."
5,Save Your Screenwriting Career!,"Blake Snyder has written one of the most simple, straightforward, inspiring and entertaining screenwriting books in recent memory. Sure, there are other more 'literate' screenwriting books, those that are full of deep thoughts and compelling ideas, those that cause you to search your soul and summon your shadow to the surface! And most -- if not all -- of those authors have never sold a single script to Hollywood!Don't get me wrong, I love to wax philosophic about the greater possibilities of screenwriting and filmmaking as much as the next arteest! But if you want to actually sell scripts in this town, so that you can have the cash and cache to write the Great American Screenplay...read, memorize, and apply the industry truths contained in this tome!You will not only learn how to save the cat, but you'll also save time, suffering, and very likely your career."
5,excellent book,This book will help any screenwriter not waste her time on a subject that will never get produced by a reputable production company
3,"A fun book to read, useful hints but no revelation.","Like all books written on the subject, this book has a dogmatic approach to storytelling that will repel some people.However, it also contains useful hints and anecdotes that may help you craft a well paced story.It's not quite as deep and philosophical as Campbell or McKee...but it's also way easier and a lot more fun to read.Buy it, read it, forget it.What you will remember of it when you write your story is what's important."
5,SAVE THE CAT,"At the urging of several members of the Nebraska Writers Workshop, this book was selected for review of screenwriting basics for our calendar of topics in 2012. The late Blake Snyder presented a clear, concise overview of the essential creative tools any writer needs to pen a screenplay. Every guru of the film industry such as Field, McKee, Truby, Seger, Hunter, Hauge and Vogler explains a unique approach to cinematic storytelling, but Blake melded the many approaches in a tidy manner that can give even experienced screenwriters a succinct grasp of fundamentals. SAVE THE CAT should be the first book any beginning screenwriter reads and the experienced periodically return to for clarification."
5,Great for both Writers and Watchers,"I'm not a screenwriter, but I found this book to be a wonderful guide into how movies work.Snyder describes movies as Swiss-clock-like emotion machines, and his method breaks the gears down to show you how they are put together. Someone interested in writing screenplays will find the advice invaluable, as Snyder dissects a movie into small, manageable chunks so that you can see how to make each piece.But it's equally enjoyable for someone who's just interested in watching movies. After reading this book, I started seeing movies in a whole different light: I can see how the B story functions; I can tell when the midpoint is giving you that false sense of victory/defeat; I can see how all the ""beats"" in the script make appeals to very primal instinctual desires.If you like movies at all, you'll enjoy this book. It's definitely not meant for writers alone."
2,Not great,"He gives pretty bad films as good examples of well-executed scripts. A few good ideas inside but, overall, this book will turn you into a bad Hollywood writer. Snyder's ideas and beliefs seem to be the antithesis of originality and artistry. Save your money and time and buy another screenwriting book - there are better ones available."
5,Screenwriting for Novelists,"I write novels, not screenplays, but screenwriting has a great deal to offer to us all. This CAT book is easy to read, easy to unserstand,and is loaded with helpful ideas and information. I recommend it to all who write fiction. Opal"
4,"Good Read, but with a grain of salt","If you are an aspiring screenwriter, this is a quick read and gives you one slant on the basics of screenwriting. However, I would read other books or take an online class to get a more broad perspective on writing screenplays. The ""grain of salt"" refers to the fact that Snyder has only one movie to his credit, Blank Check (of which he freely admits), so you have to be careful with just how seriously you take his advice to heart. There are many other great books out there in Amazon-land that do a much more thorough, and realistic job of teaching you about writing for the blockbuster movie. ""The Idiot's guide to Screenwriting"" by Skip Press is just one good example, and more practical. Nonetheless, I would still recommend this in your reading repertoire."
3,"First Few Chapters Were Great, Then...","Yeah, the rest of the book pretty much sucked.The first few chapters were awesome and witty, and I felt somewhat enlightened.But, after that, the rest of the book was self-aggrandizing, redundant, and overall boring. I gave up, and didn't continue reading. :(I was pretty disappointed because it had so many great reviews. I guess I should have listened to the minority of the reviewers that gave it more negative criticism."
3,Aight,"This book is kinda difficult I believe, and would not recommend to just anyone. I purchase this book for my IPad sometime ago and I have the hard copy, but I'm not impress .Cheers,Sharif"
4,Screenplay's explained,I'm recommending this book to my Film and Culture class. Excellent resource for understanding the how and why of what makes a good movie.
2,Purple Prose,"I almost never write a review, but this book is so poor that I felt the need to warn you. The ""writer"" drops many names, but there are no examples of a screenplay. None at all. And the advice given is no more than what a first year English major will learn."
3,Following a Formula Creates Formulaic Movies,"I've found this book very helpful in many ways. The problem is that any book that claims to have THE answer or THE formula for a great movie is setting you up for disappointment. I have no doubt that if you follow this formula, you could end up with a career much like Blake Snyder's - two mediocre credits to your name and a whole bunch of uncredited script doctoring jobs. For people who want a little more from their writing career, I would caution you against sticking too closely to Snyder's formula."
4,"Good, Practical Resource","""Save the Cat"" is a very useful and practical checklist of the things that need to be there for your screenplay to work. Your brilliance and originality still need to be added and the author makes that clear. But this book steers you away from a lot of common writing pitfalls, and offers some tests (and some ""tricks"") to make sure the right ingredients are in the mix. Use the book's tricks and techniques in a cheesy or hackish manner and you'll get a cheesy, hackish product. But, bottom line, ""STC"" is an excellent point of reference to check in with while writing a screenplay. It zeroes in on the important stuff without wading through a lot of theory and background. This book alone can't make you talented or original. But, used properly, it can help make sure that your script is a ""good read"" and will increase your chances that someone might think that what you've written is a movie."
4,For NOT thinking outside of the box,"If a mindless studio movie is what you want to write, and money is your goal, then this book is for you. If you want to be an artist, you would be better off looking elsewhere. And that's not necessarily a shot at the author. Many people are in it for the money. Personally, I would rather write a great movie that will really move people one way or the other. All you have to know about the author is that he trashes an amazingly written film like ""Memento"" for not making any money, yet triumphs such non-classics as ""Legally Blonde"" and ""Miss Congeniality"" because they did make money. I'm pretty sure that 20 years from now people will be talking about Memento and not the other two, no matter how much money they made. But I guess that's what should be expected from somebody who proudly says that he wrote ""Stop, Or My Mom Will Shoot""."
5,"Pleasant read, short and to the point","First, I didn't believe all the hype about Save The Cat! - That is, until I read it. The read is relatively short and to the point, entertaining, concrete and if there were only three things I have learned from this book - that is the Logline, The Board and The Beat sheet - the book has enriched my filmmaking abilities. The only small downside I found was that Mr. Snyder seems a bit arrogant for my taste, but that's just a small speck on an otherwise great book. It is not the only read, of course, and I am currently reading Syd Field's Screenplay, plan a reread of McKee's story and have the Seger book on shelf - Save the Cat is definitely one of the very important books to read on the art of screenwriting.Kamil BeerDirector/Writer"
5,Excellent for ad copywriters too!,"I had heard great things about this book and invested in it. First, I am not a screen writer. But I am a marketing copywriter that must create stories that engage the mind. This was one of the best books I had read on this subject. Thorough and a step-by-step plan for writers who want to make an impact with their writing. I highly recommend this for every writer! Troy White"
5,A young writer's inspiration!,"Excuse me while I name drop, but I was referred to read this book by one of Jamie Foxx's good friends, Johnny MF Mac, and I have to say that I have not regretted spending my limited down time to stop and read a few chapters a week. Even though I'm still only at the beginning of the book, when I get time to work on my script ideas, I am able to automatically implement what I've learned from the book to my scripts, and it has helped my easily format and explain my ideas in my head to written form. Its a great book so far. I can't wait to finish it!"
4,Keeps the Litter Box Fresh,"Save the Cat is a screenwriters guide with claws. Most of the stuff you read in guides has been said before in lots of ways, but Snyder keeps the information fresh. Instead of saying ""Make your protagonist likeable,"" Snyder uses the cat metaphor. Show him being nice. The info is presented with humor. It's like having lunch with a script doctor who's an industry insider. You come away feeling able to get back to work saving your own little kittens."
3,"It's ok, but...","I read and studied the book and I believe it's good to get a feeling for the film structures. I can find the 3 act structure and most of the beats in films while having the beat sheet next to me although not every film seems to hit all the beats in my experience. Maybe this depends on genre (some genres are not using all the beats?) or maybe it depends on the way films are edited after being written.The book offers a lot of tools that can make a screenplay stronger. Personally, I still like to have other books next to it, like ""Story"" by Robert McKee and The Writer's Journey by Christopher Vogler. I believe that every book that you read about screenplay will make you think in another way about films and will help you write the next one even better.André"
5,Noor ala Noor,"Lady Duff Gordon's account of her time in Egypt tells the at times heartbreaking, at times exhilerating story of an Englishwoman's immersion into Egyptian culture during the 1860s--the first of its kind, and arguably the last. The impact her Letters had on future travellers and the understanding of Egypt imparted was perhaps, regrettably, not as wide or as deep as one would wish, considering the future of the Europeans in Egypt. Still today, her admirable open-mindedness and perspective is enlightening and humbling. She was a remarkable woman and her Letters are no less than a representation of that loveliness and dignity."
1,What's love got to do with it?,"My book club selected this novel, and I was very glad to see it end! The title refers to the theme of the book--as one character says, ""the mathematics of love defy arithmetic"" (216). In other words, if a person feels physically attracted to another person, age, gender, and marital status shouldn't stand in the way. People who think otherwise are called ""old-fashioned"" 3 times in just 10 pages (311, 314, and 320). So although I found some of the information about photographic processes and the author's use of language in certain passages interesting, the disdain for and name-calling of those of us who are ""old-fashioned"" turned me off from this story very quickly."
4,Simply the best!,I own this product and I think it's simply the best. It works perfectly and I have yet to have a problem with it. I highly recommend it.
1,jimbo perrin,well I purchased a used unit at a pawn shop and it worked but it would start to record and stop on it's own and it would render that cd useless and most of the time it would start dubbing a cd and would not have any audio the 175.00 I paid for it was not worth it at all..
1,Not Satisfied,This product was great while it worked. The problem was it failed after a short period of time and would have cost more then the initial price to repair. After spending $200.00 I felt being able to burn approx. 50 CD'S was a rip off. I suggest you look elswhere.
2,hard to use,The classic model cdr200 is the only piece of stero equipment that i have to continually use the operator manual. It skip and stop at the beginning of some recording. Sometime you can't get the trays to open. When it was working the recording was very good. I would not recommend this unit to anyone.
3,ITS REALLLLY GOOD.,"this book i thought was gonna be big. instead it looked like a travel guide, but dont let this fool you. the inside is really great. great houses. great builts. great interiors. it has three other translations of languages. the main pictures somewhat looked smaller than they should have been, but this book is definitely worth having on your shelves. along with other great architecture books. dont expect most of the pictures to be big enough for details though."
2,Potentially great visual resource marred by low quality production,This little book had the potential for greatness ... fantastic visual resource (minimal written reference) but its low quality construction severely negates any rave reviews. The teNeues Publishing Company has obviously tried to produce a Taschen-esque type publication but has failed miserably on the quality. As soon as you begin looking through this book you can hear the badly glued spine cracking and splitting and after one peruse the cover has started coming away from my book. Further use of the book simply causes more and more damage and it is obvious that soon all I will have is a totally disintegrating book !!!
4,Great,I am really happy with this purse... my only concern is that the handle on the zipper has already fallen off.
2,Nothing an Elvis Fan Hasn't Already Heard,"This book is a poorly edited, mediocre attempt at describing the Colonel and his relationship to Elvis. While the book presents many interesting facts about the Colonel, it fails to put any perspective on the relationship between the most infamous manager and an American icon. Somewhere there is an interesting book to be written about the pull mediocre management has on great artists (ask the Beatles, Willie Nelson, and Billy Joel, among others). This ain't it."
1,Utter Rubbish,"The author of this book makes many false assertions, baseless comparisons and claims, and in general, wrote a book that simply doesn't line up with either facts or common sense. If you really want a good book on the same topic, tryIn Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto."
4,a breath of fresh air,"This book gives a different, and much appreciated perspective on nutrition and eating. For years I've suspected that the diet fascists were wrong. One day it's oat bran, then it's olive oil, then it's trans fat free....where does it end? We're on fat free diets and getting fatter than ever. This book offers a dose of sanity to the diet craziness."
5,a great story,"This movie is not just for those who love the beatles. This is a movie for anyone who loves a great story. the dialogue and acting are absorbing and not full of cliches. the dynamics between John Lennon , Stuart Sutcliffe and Astrid draw you in whether you ever heard of the Beatles or not.The love story of Stu and Astrid will captivate all romantics and the music and raunchiness of Hamburg nightlife will enthrall rock lovers.Just a great movie to watch more than once. you will fall in love with the characters. Steven Dorf is amazing and underrated in this movie...."
3,Where's The Story of Keith R. Bumming Cigs At Art College?,"""Backbeat"" covers the two minutes the Beatles were a rough-and-ready rock band -and in particular the relationship between Lennon(Ian Hart) and art school friend Stu Sutcliffe(Steven Dorff)- before they sold out and became family-friendly choirboys for mass acceptance. As such, it captures their scruffy Liverpool/Hamburg milieu well (if anyone wanted to know), and Lennon's early wit and verve before he became a navel-gazing acidhead and later megalomaniac inventor of peace. Except for some interesting painting sex scenes, Sutcliffe and German girlfriend Astrid (the as usual charmless Sheryl Lee) make a dull center for the film, and even Hart can't quite make this seem like a worthwhile use of celluloid (the film glides over the fact that Lennon once kicked Sutcliffe in the head during a scuffle and so probably caused the eventual hemmorage that killed him, but that's Instant Karma for ya)."
3,Needed Work But Was Okay,"If you're looking for accurate info on the Beatles I don't know if this movie is the number one choice. But if you're into great Rock N Roll, this movie is pretty good. Stephen Dorff was very good and so was Ian Hart. Sheryl Lee was terrible and didn't fit the role. Sorry but her acting brought down the relationship between Stu and Astrid. Yet she and Dorff surprisingly had chemistry. BackBeat is full of class and humorous charm. This film is not perfect by all means...but so so entertaining."
3,Mediocre,"This movie is okay--at least there's a minimal resemblance to the real people. Based on what I've read about the Beatles over the years-there seems to be a bit of revisionism in this movie--examples are Stu Sutcliffe mentioning ""8 days a week"" and John, ""A Hard Days Night"" even though Paul says a taxi driver gave him the words, ""8 days a week"" and Ringo is credited with ""A Hard Days Night"" as one of his more famous malapropisms. Despite these type incidents-the movie is still fairly enjoyable, although it's really the Stu and Astrid story with a lot of John Lennon. Paul to a slight degree and George and Pete are treated as insignificant characters. Still, it's worth watching if your a Beatle buff/"
5,What happened to this edition?,"What happened to the Backbeat Special Edition? Did it ever come out? I had preordered it from Amazon but it never shipped -- it went from preorder to ""out of stock"" on the supposed release date. Was the release delayed? Amazon should update their information on this item."
2,Who cares!,"Who cares about the ""fifth"" Beatle! WHAT FIFTH BEATLE! Hello.....there were only 4 Beatles as far as history goes! But to go so far as to spend over 2 hours exploring a guy who wasn't even a Beatle at all. I would have much rather had seen what made McCartney and Lennon so prolific together. How did all that music start? Who got what idea first? Where was the genius in all of this? In this film Paul comes off like a choir boy younger brother to the controlling Lennon. And where the heck is Ringo in all of this? A mere mention of him! This is supposed to be a film about the greatest rock band of the 20th century and we're wasting film on a guy who never even did anything of any value with the group! I had no desire to ""get to know Stu"" or his German girlfriend. I WANTED RAW MEAT BEATLES! Instead this film serves up a large empty plate that left me hungry for the real deal! Creative license run amuck!"
5,Pretty Nice Stuff,"I came across this movie at a local VC sell-out. It turned out to be the first feature movie about the Beatles I ever enjoyed. Well I never! The general idea, the team or actors, the sound of 60s and even the Liverpool accent spoken, all in all produced that penetrating feeling of those times gone once and back again on the screen. Really touching and marvellous stuff!"
3,"Worthwhile, with Ian Hart offering a low-key tour de force","Fans of the short-lived USA network trash treasure ""Dirt"" will have trouble connecting psychotic photographer Don Konkey with the soulful John Lennon in this film. It may even be enough to encourage a view of ""Aberdeen,"" in which he gives a similarly-excellent performance.""Backbeat"" is a nice depiction of the Beatles' beginnings and, by no means coincidentally, their first exposure to the power of media, as Astrid's photos did much in 1963-1964 to establish the tough soulful qualities of the Fab Four. Much better than we had any right to expect, and it ages well, despite the fact that it was...gasp...46 years ago today when Johnnie Lennon got his band to play."
1,It's Been A Dull Day's Night,"Someone got the bright idea to make a film about the early Beatles. Sounds good, right? Only they left out casting actors with any charisma or bothering to write a script with any wit or insight. Backbeat is a failure on many levels, but it fails in that way only extraordinarily bad films can, it's dreadfully boring."
1,My Bad!,I screwed up. I bought this DVD because a friend recommended the music. I should have read the ratings and was disappointed to find all the all the sexual content. I previewed the film in 16x speed and sure enough there was too much nudity for me to feel comfortable with. So I I trashed it.No criticism of anyone except myself. I didn't do enough homework. Doh! mdv
2,"Boring, dragged on. Action in last 10 minutes","Do you wonder why hardly anyone has heard of this film? There's a reason for that. It is so boring, and drags like no other film you've seen. Surrounds the very early days of Lennon and his friend (played by Stephen Dorff).Don't waste your time. Nothing that interesting to tell."
3,Average,"This is an alright belt. You don't expect much for this price and you won't get a high class belt either. It's alright and pretty nice looking, but the ""leather"" is very stiff and hard controlled when you for example want to hang it up on a hook."
5,A Typophile's Treasure-trove!,"My first viewing was an early snippet when Gary presented it at the TypeCon typography conference over a year ago. He then showed the final product at TypeCon the following year to cheering crowds of type aficionados and answered questions afterwards. It is loaded with great interviews with the likes of Matthew Carter, Massimo Vignelli, and Erik Spiekermann. You'll laugh, you will cry! You will ask for more. The DVD has extra clips not seen in theaters. It is hard to imagine a starring role by a typeface, but the ubiquitous Helvetica may start a new Academy Award category, ""Best Performance by a Typeface in a Leading Role""."
4,Surprisingly Interesting,"I just had to say, I don't know why I watched this, or even why it was made, but it was actually very interesting. I never would have thought a doc. about font would hold my interest."
2,"Perhaps if you work in the ""world of fonts"" then you'll be interested.","I found this film VERY had to sit through. I honestly can't believe I watched the entire thing. I guess I thought it would get better. . .but never did. For me it was kind of an ""anti-Arial"" film. I get it that the creators of Helvetica are not happy that Arial came along. . . I don't blame them. . . but so it goes in business.I guess if you are in a business where fonts are a big and important part of your work, then this film might be quite interesting. But if not, I think I would pass."
4,A well executed documentary,This is proof positive that a well executed documentary can be successful despite focusing on subject matter that could have very easily been dull.
3,you know what looks dated? Helvetica,"Interesesting if you are interested in anachronisms: phrenology, cheese blitzes, eugenics...Helvetica! One more thing people decided would be the paradigm shift and was actually just a demarkation for a style in a time. Oh well, we always had Times New Roman to lean on in support."
4,Should be boring~,When my husband said what this movie was about I thought he was crazy. Why in the heck would I want to watch an entire documentary dedicated to font not only that just ONE font. Interestingly I have watched it more then once and I still find it interesting.
2,"Couldn't finish it, simply too slow and not entertaining enough",Far from an informative documentary this is much more akin to a handful of music videos set behind corporate logos with Helvetica.
2,"Boring, even for a movie about a typeface","I have a high tolerance for slow documentaries, but this one was pretty dull. There were some interesting bits; talking heads that got really passionate about art and design, stories about the old days of typesetting, etc. But too much of the film was pretentious filler."
1,oh PAleeeese!,"BOOORING! A bunch of pseudo-intellectual designers trying to sell people on the idea that helvetica is the most awesome thing to ever come along in type. Lets put it this way...it works for the swiss, it is their claim to fame, they can have it."
1,Bad Documentary!,"This is a terrible documentary. It is a story without a plot, and many, many ""examples"" of Helvetica shown are, in fact, other san serif typsefaces! The film editor obviously isn't sensitive enough to typeface design to recognize the difference between Helvetica and other san serif designs (for example, Bloomingdales dept store!). A bad disappointment, one of the most wasteful DVDs I've ever seen!"
1,Is this a joke?,Are you people really reviewing a documentary about a font? Get a life. Please tell me this is a joke.
2,Antennas are very weak,"At first, I thought this was a pretty good box. It does a good job picking up most TV signals, and the amplification is really good. Unfortunately, after three months of gentle use, both of the antennas have broken. They are cheaply constructed and cannot bear the full weight of the antennas when extended. Plus, the Magnavox website doesn't even list the product. I would not buy again."
4,"Needed item for most computers, but costly","My computer doesn't have a port for a Memory Stick, so using any one of Sony's products that use them is impossible without using this adapter. Sony's digital cameras and digital voice recorders (why I have one) all use this media format, so forgetting to buy one can prevent your enjoyment of your own equipment.To use the adapter, you just slide the Stick into the adapter, and then the adapter goes into your regular 3.5"" disk drive, looking just like a regular disk. There is some software included to assist in the applications you will use with it, inluding the voice recognition program I originally hoped to use, but is sold separately.I don't really know why the item is as much as it is, but it is necessary for most folks. I guess one way of looking at it is that it offers the same functionality as a Compact Flash card reader, just more expensive."
2,"Good Idea, not everything works","My company purchased this flopy disc interface so that we could let any of the graphic artists pop the card into the machines without moving the USB reader we have around.. unfortunatly the card won't work on a dual processor system, so none of our graphic artists can use it. I think for the price we paid for it, it should be able to work on any system!"
3,A Fun Read,"The Passionate is yet another work of pulp fiction from the prolific author Carter Brown. In this one, Lt. Al Wheeler investigates the mysterious disappearance of a cadaver from the county morgue and soon finds himself caught up in a web of lies, murder, and blackmail. Along the way, Wheeler discovers a conspiracy involving two sultry twin sisters, a washed-up tennis pro, an arrogant game hunter, and a mysterious criminal known as Messenger John. Perhaps not surprisingly, the plot really doesn't make much sense if you give it too much thought but since when do you read a Carter Brown novel for the plot? This book has all of the hard-boiled dialogue, shamelessly inappropriate humor, and tough prose that one should expect from Carter Brown, all leading up to a surprisingly dark and powerful ending. The Passionate may not be what is popularly considered to be a work of great literature but it is a fun and entertaining read."
5,good daily read,Recommend this book as a daily devotional. Great book by an amazing author. Great for gift giving and daily Word.
5,An exhaustive appendix of reproducible teaching,"Teaching Math To People With Down Syndrome And Other Hands-On Learners by instructional resources consultant and cognitive disabilities expert DeAnna Horstmeier is Book 1 of the Topics in Down Syndrome series and an emphatically practical guide especially for special education professionals or anyone charged with abstract instruction to cognitively challenged students. Chapters address teaching strategies for basic math survival skills, calculator useage, writing numerals, whole number addition and subtraction, time, shapes and patterns, money, and more fill this superb educator guidebook with emphasis on practical needs. An exhaustive appendix of reproducible teaching and assessment materials rounds out this superb reference, study guide, and manual of tips, tricks, and techniques."
4,pretty good resource,"I have been going through this quite exhaustive resource over the past couple days. It seems to be very good in content and I think I will enjoy using this with my daughter who has FAS.The reproducible pages are great; however, I am finding it difficult to easily reproduce them since they don't lie flat. That's really the only qualm I have. It may help to also have this available in a spiral or binder format, to make the necessary reproducibles easier to reproduce!"
4,Great book,This book has some great tips on helping people with Down Syndrome learn math skills. This would be great for learners who have difficulty with traditional teaching.
5,Bing's the Best,"While you won't hear ""White Christmas"" in this collection, you will hear Bing sing some of his best Christmas songs, each a Christmas gem. Technically the recording sounds clean and clear, and sentimentally it should put you in the Christmas mood. My personal favorites are 'Do You Hear What I Hear' and 'Christmas Dinner Country Style.'"
1,"Looks healthy, but made with partially hydrogentated oil?!?","I bought this for my picky 5yo, since she'll actually eat this for lunch at school. I didn't even THINK for a second to check the ingredients to see if the trans-fat ridden and cheap ""Partially Hydrogenated"" oil was used to make FROOT LOOPS. -I mean, really! I cannot believe that in the year 2006, Kellogs is still using such cheap and unhealthy ingredients in their cereals, which are aimed at kids!! They have at least attempted to make this cereal seem ""healthy"" by lowering the sugar content, but would be even better if they took out the partially hydrogenated crap!!!"
3,Check your Libruary,"My Libruary has many Disks of Huckielberry Hound, check at yours, and thanks for the Message about these 8 Min clips which could be priced lower."
3,Great mystery read!,"Great read! This book has it all: great characters, loads of action, twists and turns that keep you guessing until the very end and interesting regional language.The main character, Mechelle Deakes, does tend to get over dramatic at times, but I guess that's an important trait for this character.Fast reading...I read it in a day.I'm looking forward to the next Abercrombie book."
3,Poor quality blu ray video transfer,The documentary itself is very good but the image quality is very low for Blu Ray. Looks like a cheap video transfer. There is no need to spend the extra money on the Blu Ray version when a standard DVD will produce the same results when played in a Blu Ray player.
3,arent there yet,"I think that nintendo could have done a better job with this. They could have allowed more games to be compatible with this but there are only few. Zelda: the Windwaker, Final Fantasy: crystal chronacyls, and animal crossing are one of the few games that can be played on this. maybe they will start making more games for this and if they do i say that you should buy this for sure, but for now i think they just 'arent there yet'.for the cheap price if you have these games buy it but if you dont then i would say that you shouldnt buy it if you dont have atleast two of the games.Thank you for reading my review,random reviewer"
2,good but cant use it enough,I dont even know how good this thing works because out of five games i have only zelda the wind waker can use this. but my friends have a gamecube and it works well
2,not yet usefull,"My kid asked for the cable with the hope of use it with the Sonic, the manual indicates a very restricted use, only in the Chao Garden, up to new he has been unable to transfer anything."
1,Marketting Tool,What this thing does is allow Nintendo to release games that require you own both the gamecude and the gameboy to play all aspects of the game. For example in Animal Crossing there is an island that you cannot visit unless you have this cable and a gameboy. The characters in the game go so far as to suggest that you buy a gameboy so you can visit the island. In my opinion this is a pretty crummy way to sell video game hardware.
4,It's required.,"Basically, this will be required for Pokemon Colosseum, Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles.It significantly enhances the gameplay of Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker, and likely will do the same to next Zelda game (which won't be coming out for quite a while).If you plan on buying either of the first two games, buy this. If you want to add 1 and a half-player functionality (rather than 1-player) to Zelda, buy this.Otherwise don't.By the way...IT IS NOT A GBA PLAYER. YOU CANNOT PLAY GBA GAMES ON YOUR CUBE WITH THIS.Don't get mad at Nintendo because you didn't see what you were buying, guys..."
1,not cool,"dont get this unless you have a specific intention for it. if you just want to buy cool gamecube accessories stay away from this! it does not function for many games at all, and even though it is a cool idea, i sold mine as fast as possible after i learned of its minimal capabilities. a product like this has potential, but definately wait until some good game comes out that supports it in a big way. dont let any review that says that its good without giving specific reasons of specific games that it is good for."
4,Its ok but useful in some games,This is ok but it is only great for some games I warn you do not get this expecting you can play some games on the gamecube the only thing that can do that is an gameboy player for the gamecube but the only problem is that they did not put out any new colors for it but really the black goes well with the platinum gamecube and the black gamecube ofcourse but the Indigo one is hhorrible looking but if it is like in a dark spot on your floor or where ever you put it will look ok. I dont even know that it is there because it is dark in the spot in my room so it is good but the point is that the pokemon colossum game is going to need it and other games also so dont rush your self to get it untill a game comes out that needs it.
5,A good accessory for Gamecube,"If you haven't already bought the GC/GBA link cable, buy this today.You'll find it to be extremely useful for games like Animal Crossing, Zelda-The Wind Waker, and others. It will allow you to see more map areas in Zelda, get hints and so forth. Be sure to buy the Nintendo brand prodct, they last longer and are more durable."
4,dont work!,"this product doesnt work but it was brand new, you may have to purchase the inner part of the gc, i going to try that."
5,fun blast from the past,These cables allow the game boy advance to connect to the game cube allowing multiplayer game play. It's fun playing the old games again with family and friends.
1,GARBAGE!,"What a waste of my money! I followed the instructions, had a proper diet and worked out without results. I gave it one star only because I HAD to give it at least 1 star to post this review."
1,NOT IMPRESSED,"Ordered 2 of these, one for myself and one for a friend. Neither of us saw ANY affects from this pill. No decreased appetite at all. It was nothing more than a sugar pill if you ask me. Will not buy again."
5,Good Diet Option,"I have had good success the first two months I been using this product. Have lost some weight and am not constantly fighting that ""I am starving"" feeling. I think that I will have to add the metabolic enhancer in the upcoming months - which is the only down side, it is a bit costly."
5,RARE PERFORMANCES,"Surprisingly, Shindig put on quite a show. Some perfomances I had no idea were out there, Joe Tex and Major Lance were a find. Thank you, Shindig. And the milk commercial was a scream."
5,Leon is Back!,"Finally, Leon has cast his demons aside and made some great music. With the exception of ""Legend in My Time"", Leon Russell fans have had to endure some very mediocre CDs for a long time. Now Leon is back! Standouts include ""Rip Van Winkle"" (Leon's sense of humor is back), ""Dark Carousel"" (yes, Leon knows melody), ""Strange Power of Love"" (the blues), and ""The Same Old Song"" (big band jazz). I've always thought Leon to be one of the most talented musicians in the music industry. He just seemed to collapse after the breakup with Mary. Now, if you want to hear some great blues,rock,and jazz in one CD, give the old man a chance and listen to what he's playing."
4,Best pity buy I ever made.,"I bought the novella version in bookform because I heard the author's career was on the skids. Sounds strange, but I've found that many of the authors I like aren't well appreciated. Anyway this was pretty good, if somewhat more artsy than I usually like. In fact few male authors write artsy so it was interesting. It is good at being optimistic without being cloying. It isn't the best thing I've ever read, but it is better than a lot of the stuff that's popular. In some ways it reminded me of ""A Rose for Ecclesiastes"" by Roger Zelazny, but I think Zelazny's story is probably a bit better. This is pretty good nevertheless, & although I rarely say this if there were a market for artsy science fiction movies I could see this being adapted. It has some nice imagery and I'd like to see who'd play whom. Well enjoy it."
2,Still waiting to laugh...,"I wasn't really sure how I was going to start this review. But let me first off say that I am a huge fan of anything Bam's been in.I have Season 1 on PSP and I thought it would just get better with the other seasons.I was wrong. This lacked the randomness that Bam & Co. was known for in earlier Jackass and CKY videos. MTV wrapped their hands around this and got what they wanted. Comedy that is completely over the top and unbelievable.Finding Phil & Ape in Paris? Finding Random Hero and Don Vito in Times Sqaure? C'mon people.Maybe that's what's so appealing about these last two 'seasons'.It was just so set-up and beyond possibility. I'm not asking for my 30 bucks back, but I can only reccomend this set for completests."
1,"Viva La... oh, nevermind.","I'm quite sick of Bam, his show, and his eleventeen year old following. He got to where he is by skating, and he isn't even that great. He used to be good when he was on Toy Machine, but all he friggin' skates is FDR park now. Mmmmyep. Quite sick. No wonder Jenn Rivell left him."
5,"""Best show ever""","I can't wait till this comes out. I hope this one has commentary because the last one didn't,and Vito's vulcan hillarious. I've seen every single episode I can't wait to own the final 2 seasons."
3,pretty good for being scripted,we all know that this is scripted but we cant help but crack a smile when bam pisses off his family... but then again we all know that bams mom really doesnt live with bam nor his dad.but it still is funny for being 90% fake
4,Could have been better,"Well the Dvd is awesome but it could have been some much better.. There's no deleted scenes..That sucks..Cause you allways wanna see more of them..Some of the greatest things they do doesn't make the show because MTV is pussies..Audio Commentary is on it..But it's not ass good ass the one on Season 1..It's kinda half assed...The Season 1 DVD is the best no doubt..I will buy this DVD also but im not that psyked about it really..I wanna see some deleted scenes!!!Anyways, if you buy this dvd don't expect something big (except det episodes but you already knew that)"
5,"Viva La Bam, Seasons 4+5","If you're any fan of bam, the cKy crew, or even Don Vito, you will love this DVD collection, with more hilarious hijinks, pranks and ass kickings than the first three seasons, this is a must have for the Viva La Bam fans out there"
4,if you a VIVA LA BAM fan then buy tihs,i love viva la bam but its not the complete season its missing like 2 or 3 episode witch blows but its still great i recamend it $buy! $buy! $buy!
5,best show ever,"I've been a fan of bam since jackass came on the air and i have to say this is 100 percent better than jackas and wildboys put together. This season is definantly one of the funniest ones including alot more fun with the bloodhound gang. This is a must have for every die hard bam margera fan. buy it you wont regret it. FYI one of the best episodes has to be when dunn and his junkie limo challenge bam and his LAMBO to a race. needless to say, he doesn't win but it still is the best episode on this dvd in my opinion."
3,I think it worked,The dye we had might have been old or I might not have used the right amounts of soda ash for our tye dye project but the colors all were very light after washing.
5,As described,"No complaints, you get what you see! One bag of soda ash. Buying this one saves you money... at the local store you get only a little bit of the soda ash for only a couple of dollars less. Might as well get more of it for a little bit more money."
2,Not a help for fixing the dye in my tye dye shirts. Third wash and color almost completely faded,presoak washing and fading were the results after 3 washing more and more and more fading or bleeding. This product did not prevent bleeding to almost gone....
5,Needed for dying something green,This seemed to perform as expected. Plenty left over for future projects. Got a good bright green using this with emerald green Procion dye.
3,Bluetooth Playing Music Incapable,"I am disappointed that while yes, this can play mp3s, it cannot play them thru the bluetooth headset.Extremely slow response time.Cannot transfer my own ringtones via usb cable from pc, locked down.Very very nice looking phone."
2,Bad Purchase!,"I have this for a little less than a year and all it's given me is problems. Yes, it's cute but the phone is not worth the money that I paid for it! First of all when people call me it goes straight to voicemail...I don't know if it's the phone or the sprint service because I've heard the same complaint from many people that have very different phones. The front of the phone gets marked easily with fingerprints so I always find myself cleaning it. When I hang up my phone,I the volume automatically goes very low although it was very high up prior to closing the phone. It turns off on it's own and then goes to the screen where I have to put the password in order to use it. I have never tried to put music into it because from what I know, I have to pay for each song from spint and the prices are not really worth it! The phone does voice command by itself...many issues just don't purchase!"
5,Great spoons!,I have been using these for over five years and love them! I would highly recommend these spoons! They have held up really well.
4,Great!,"Mary Stewart remains one of the best of the genre. While not my favorite of hers, it's definitely worth a read!"
1,Response to Sermon,"I purchased several of Munroe's books because of a message I heard/saw on TV some 25 years ago having to do with ""purpose."" The delivery and content of that message was at excellent. I've glanced at the books, but an not into his theology. The 1-star rating has more to do with my not having read the books than a bad-to-good scale review. The video message is around here somewhere on an old VHS tape."
5,WOMAN CALLED AND BLESSED,"There is so much to say about this book and the revelation it has brought. It answered alot of questions that I was asking the Lord. God always answers prayer and he did so with this book. This book helped me understand myself and why I am the way I am. I always thought of myself as a ponderer not realizing that God created me to be that way (an incubator). It also helps you understand your mate, their role and why at times you don'treceive all God has for you and your family. Now I know how to pray more effectively for him and what to pray for. I see things so much more clearly. God is so awesome and if you ask like he says, you shall receive. Thank God for Dr Myles Munroe and his obedience to write and share about the purpose of the woman. I highly recommend that all women read this book and learn their purpose and role. This will cause very much needed unity in marriages."
1,pedantic prose,"Unfortunately, what could have been a riviting excursion into the psyche of two characters whose mothers played overwhelming roles in their development, the book never seems to develop fully. The two men remain shadow figures, neither developed nor illuminated. The Mussolini's Ghost segment, while somewhat interesting, missed being funny. The heavy, pedantic approach to motherhood leaves one with the sense that both characters, and perhaps the author, are mysogynists."
3,Not as good a vintage as 2010,"Very good, but lacking compared to the supperior 2010/2011 vintage. Slighlty harsh with an unpleasant bitter finish. Still good, with a nice peppery taste on the back of the tongue, and plenty of grassy flavors, but they're overwhelmed by bitterness. So don't expect a repeat of the previous years superlative effort.All in all, not worth the high price tag of $47. Go with the Pianogrillo."
3,Good listening for a walk,"THE ART OF FEARBUSTING : SUSAN JEFFERS has put on CD one of her very first live speeches about conquering fear. She has some excellent ideas that are simple to put into practice and do a very good job of helping stop fear in any situation. The seeds of her continued teachings are all laid out in this short CD, and you have a guided meditation to help make it absorb into your subconscious to continue to help you. Although I found the CD very helpful, I felt it was far too brief. Well worth hearing more than once though."
2,Not the best of Susan Jeffers,"If you've heard or read Susan Jeffers wonderful book, ""Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway,"" then you'll be disappointed with this CD. It is just a abridged version of that other superior program, as the speaker is taped talking to a live audience. I recommend spending $ on the complete book version- it's much more rewarding."
1,USA MADE A BETTER CHOICE,"Poor quality, pot metal iron pan made in China. We ordered this pan thinking it would be a nice addition to our cast iron set but were very disappointed in the quality. Even the word skillet was misspelled on the bottom of this ""Commemorative"" skillet (skllet). After cooking and eating food prepared in this pan, we were left with an unpleasant metallic after taste. We would strongly advise buying USA made cast iron pans."
1,Poor quality,"AVOID THIS PRODUCT!! Not the quality I am used to. My husband purchased this as a present for me because he knows I love to cook in cast iron. I was skeptical once I seen the product. It did not look to have any ""seasoning"" on the pan. I only had to cook with this pan one time. Cast iron is known for cooking food evenly. It did not, the food stuck. A total mess! I actually had to scrub the pan clean. It was returned!! After some research, I still can't find if the Camp Chef products are made in China. With it not actually being said on Amazon the country of origin. I would assume that it is made in China. I will ALWAYS buy the Lodge cast iron products where you know they are made in Tennessee and what you are getting."
3,Disappointing,"I was really looking forward to hearing this album as I am a big Django Reinhardt fan. I was told that Nawahi's music was like 'Django meets Hawaii' and it is. But, Nawahi's pickin', although quaint and pretty in places, is nowhere nearly as moving or as beautiful as Django's. If you don't own any Django, get him first. You won't regret it."
4,Cute!,"If you bought the lamp, you might as well have the matching shade, right? It is pricey and why and I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, but worth it to go with the lamp."
1,I have a solution to your wall border,"Check out a wallpaper book called Hip Kids, page 30, it has a wall border that matches the Arcadia set perfectly called Plum Safari wall border, much better than the one that is suppose to come with the set."
3,Doesn't match so well,"While the colors are similar, they just don't match the bedding set or any other items very well. I just didn't like the wallborder compared to any of the other items. While I have a roll we will not be using it for that reason."
5,Great Rosin,"I am a cellist, and use this rosin. I like it very much. I often find it hard to differentiate between different rosins. I have 3 different kinds right now, but while I am trying to make up my mind about the other two, I know that I will like this rosin every time I use it. It is has a nice balance between grip and smoothness. Is it worth the money? I can't say, but rosin lasts for years so splurging on it will not end up being a huge extra cost in the long run."
3,Product dimensions,"Overall product dimensions are 34.88 "" H x 16.75 "" W x 12.13 "" Dper the Closetmaid website.Based on that information, each shelf measures @ 12"" D x 16.75"" WI rated this with 3 stars to reflect neutral opinion as I am still researching the potential purchase of this product."
5,Very cute,"My daughter is 4, and has a lot of fun with this panda. It has withstood her rough play. She is able to feed it and make it respond. She has a little trouble making it do all of the actions... a certain paw must be pressed for 3 seconds to make it play peek a boo, etc. and that is a bit difficult for her. Also, the fur is not as long as some of the other fur real friends, so it doesn't get caught in the joints of the animal or get matty. I think this toy is great, lots of fun."
1,save your money...just buy a stuffed panda toy,The eyes are pretty creepy...not a very friendly face...more like a horror movie doll! He is not soft and a child can't cuddle it like how stuffed toy should be. It seems more mechanical than anything else...obviously it is mechanical but if the company is going for realistic...this is not it!
3,Give it a chance,"I WILL be buying this toy based on the reviews because most of them were very good . I never wrote a review before I purchased a toy, but apparantly that is what some people have been doing. I think it is just pitiful that someone should give a toy a bad review because just a few people didn't like it. If you don't decide to purchase, fine, but don't give a bad review unless you have bought it. So, that's why I'm only giving 3 stars at the moment, because I haven't actually got it yet. Unlike some immature people giving it 1 star solely based on other negative reviews,... grow up. I will give a real review after I purchase this toy."
4,COOL!!!,This toy is cuddley and cute but you cant really get it to play peek-a-boo. But overall its pretty cool!
5,Great TOY!!!,"My 5 year old girl LOVES this toy. It is SO cute!! He makes the cutest noises. I have read alot of the other reviews and I totally disagree with them. It is a little hard, but what do you expect? It's not a stuffed toy, but an interactive one. Some of the other reviews complained that it couldn't hold its bottle or that it didn't play peek-a-boo very well. There is only so much a toy can do. Come on, it is still only a toy. The battery compartment is a little hard to get into, but that's fine. I don't really want it easy access to my child anyway. The bottom line is, I would definately buy this toy again. It's worth every penny!!"
2,It's not what you see on TV,"I totally agree with the reviewer from October 8th! This bear is not all it's cracked up to be.I, too, had difficulty installing the batteries. The access opening is not very large, and you must unscrew the shield before actually getting to the battery encasement. Then reattaching the shield is a true juggling act.I couldn't get the bear to play peek-a-boo on it's own: ever! I'm waiting until my 3 year old granddaughter tries it out before possibly returning the item. Maybe I'm too old for these toys.Definitely don't wear a dark color when playing with the panda: it shreds continually!My panda never held the bottle when drinking either. . . and hugging you. . . we'll see this afternoon at the party! But I'm not holding my breath on this either.This item has been marketed very slickly on TV, but what you see there is not what I saw in my living room last night."
3,A bit too realistic?,"My four-year-old is actually afraid of this little panda! She says he's scary and I think it's because his face is so realistic. I think that may be why he was only played with a couple times and then thrown aside. My eight-year-old daughter has no interest in him whatsoever, so I think the peak age for this toy is about six or so. Also, his arm has come loose from the springs connecting it to his body. Now, whenever he moves, his one arm just sort of flops oddly around."
4,accessories?,"Please note, I am guessing at the ratings because it is still in the box. We are giving this to our 6 year old for Christmas. She got a Fur Real newborn puppy for her b-day and adores it -- she even took it to school for show & tell for her ""special day"". She loves Pandas and baby dolls - so has asked for this toy. Does anyone know if this bear can be dressed up and what size? The manufacturer says 12 inches tall in the seated position - should I try 12 inch doll clothes - looks bigger than that to me? Also, I noted that Sam's Club carries what they call the ""Exclusive Black Bear Cub Baby"" - it comes with a multicolored blanket and bottle -- why don't the rest of the cubs come with blankets?"
5,Gotta get one of my own,"I bought this toy for my niece, and being the good Auntie I am I immediately pulled it out of the box to put in the batteries so it will be ready to play with when she opens it. Now I have to have one! This is the cutest toy... the sounds it makes when eating are so realistic and makes me giggle. It is hugable and lots of fun to play with. The ONLY down side is the location of the on switch.. it was kind of hard to get too."
5,"Girl Cook, but not Girl Chef",This book is full of many laughs and many unbelieveable situations! It shows that men still feel they dominate the world and woman are still struggling to break through the glass ceiling. This book is also enjoyable for anyone who loves being in the kitchen.
2,Occasionally entertaining but forgettable,"This book is not altogether unpleasant, but the narrator lacked the redeeming qualities necessary to hold my sympathy for an entire novel. The book also seemed to take more than a few ideas from Helen Fielding's ""Bridget Jones' Diary,"" but Helen Fielding does it much, much better."
2,Not impressed,I forced myself to finish this book though I found the voice of the protagonist annoying and the writing surprisingly callow in places (the author has an MFA!?). There are certainly better books in this genre to choose from.
2,Layla Mitchner is a wimp.,"As a cook in a three star restaurant, I consider Layla Mitchner an afront to women cooks everywhere. Any woman entering the culinary field knows that it has been dominated by men since Escoffier. Layla just takes this in stride as the way it is instead of sticking up for herself and showing that women, too, belong in the professional kitchen.Her penchant for bad relationships and alcohol and dreams of the ideal career and love are the only realism that kept this reader's attention."
2,A complete trainwreck,"And I was so looking forward to this book too. Layla has no spine to speak of when it comes to her boss, or her lovelife for that matter. She's a bitte former rich girl who's daddy cuts her off he dies in an accidental motocycle accident. She acts like she 'has' to suffer to make it when she has a rich mommy she can go to, and supposedly can't stand people with a silver spoon in their mouth even though she was one.The ending is most ridiculous thing I've ever read.I love chic lit, and I love cooking shows, cooking magazines, etc, and my mom owns a restaurant. I had high high hopes for this book and it was truely a let down. I basically read it all through just so I can say I read it all through and not have it lie about doing so."
1,What's the point?,I cannot figure out what this book is about. I assumed the content would be about a female cook in a male-dominated profession. Layla (the main character) imbibed in one immature relationship after another. She drank and smoked and complained about everyone and everything but did little real cooking along the way. I just don't get it.
3,Sony has poor support,"This is a great product and it worked great with Win98 but when I upgraded to XP, it did't fly. Sony's suggestion was to use 2000 drivers, but that didn't work either. XP has been out over a year and still Sony has not written drivers for it. If you don't use XP this is an easy to use device, but if you do...beware."
2,Another XP user who can no longer use the Reader,"VERY disappointed! It was wonderful with Windows 98, but the driver recommended to download for use in XP doesn't help at all. Sony has no answer. Am also finding that using the memory stick to transport Word or Excel data frequently corrupts the files and loses data. Seems the memory stick is best left to use in cameras then viewed through directly hooking up to the computer."
4,Very good photo paper.,For printing home pictures this paper works great and saves you lasting memories on paper. I will buy this paper again as the price here is lots less than at the office supply store.
1,don't waste your money,I bought this thinking it would be premium paper. It doesn't work. The ink comes off even weeks later. HP Photopaper is much better
3,Mediocre,"While you won't find information on how to safely jump out of a 2 story window into a trash dumpster, you WILL find information on how to gain control of a one-horse open sleigh, how to defend yourself against a charging reindeer and how to extricate yourself or someone else who is stranded in a chimney.Some survival tips are pure fun, like How To Repurpose A Fruitcake (doorstop, object d'art and tire block for your car are just a few), while others may actually be quite helpful in an actual situation: How To Prevent A Turkey From Exploding; How To Extinguish A Burning Turkey; and How To Treat Mistletoe (and food) Poisoning In Both People And Pets."
4,Keep it Away from the Kids,"As stated in other reviews, this covers many situations with a mix of humor and practical advice. However, be forewarned that the final entry is how to handle a child asking the dread question that crosses them over from Christmas innocent to member of the vast conspiracy we adults participate in. While the answer is very well written it can cause upset and upheaval if you have a reader who hasn't caught on yet. It's a bright, shiny holiday book and the silliness attracts kids like a magnet. Beware. On the other hand, if you've been looking to broach the subject, their approach is wonderful."
2,Wasted Time,This book was the worst case scenario of any book I could have read. I am glad I only wasted a half hour.
2,Not Happy!,"This is an elementary Texas history book, for young kids. Not appropriate for a college student! Very displeased this was not made clear!"
3,The balls inside pins annoying!,"My daughter who is two loves bowling and I thought this would be the perfect gift for her. She was excited for about five minutes when we opened it up. She then became so distracted by the balls inside that she did not want to bowl but get the little balls out and play with them instead. It took a lot but we mangaged to get them out. I would recommend buying a bowling set without the little balls inside, especially if your child is a toy ball lover."
4,great but ...,"This is a wonderful toy. The pins are really durable, almost incomparable to other bowling toys, and they make a satisfying sound when hit. My boy calls it a ""ten pin bowling sound."" He is four, but my two year old loves it as well.The only reason I give it four stars is that previous versions of the game had a nice stand on which to set up the pins. It meant you could use it on rough terrain, and also even little kids could make a triangle. In fact, although the pins are great in themselves, the stand was a major feature. It seems Little Tikes stopped making these which is an awful blunder and should be punished. Buy an old version on ebay instad."
4,Immediate fun!,"Christmas gift for 4 year old boy who is part of an actual bowling league. This item was opened and played with immediately. He became creative and set pins in positions other than ""normal"" and had great fun."
4,"Look out, here it comes!","My only complaint is with the bowling ball. It is a hard plastic ball. It is extremely loud as it slams onto the floor. If not used with caution, it can cause harm to people and objects. A ball of a different material would make this a much better set."
2,Guess he was branching out...,"After loving Bill Miller's Red Road CD, I bought this one without listening to it. As far as generic music is concerned this is well done and pleasant, but if you are looking for hard core native music, this isn't it."
2,Disapointing,"I once heard an instrumental work of Bill Millers on the radio, and it was magnificent, so I was very dissapointed when I bought this cd and heard music completly different from what I expected. I strongly recommend finding some samples of this music before actually buying it."
1,"Err, Mr Brady -- or is it Manchester?","Jim Brady must have fallen asleep at his word processor while re-reading ""Goodbye Darkness"" by William Manchester, then awakened to write his latest book. Mildly interesting in the beginning, this tale of old soldiers revisiting battle sites is predictably similar, and disappointing. After all, most of the readers probably sense that the South-North Korean DMZ environment is -- while still ""scary"" -- nothing like the atmosphere during the furious outpost fights of 1952-1953. Therefore it is hard to identify with Brady's professed disappointment with this trip. Salting the reported junket for a newsmag article with snippets from his own ""The Coldest War"" doesn't help -- one should put this new book down and read that one instead, his first Marine Corps-in-Korea tale, and far better."
3,"Very cute, but difficult to put up!","We too found this wall border a bit difficult to place on the baby's room wall. We found the instructions on the inside of the cover, but the instructions don't really work. Rolling and then placing in the water does not soak the backing enough to make it stick. What we found works best is to cut off the amount we need for the wall section we are placing up, then take the entire strip and lay it in the water tray flat, soaking the entire piece. With two people, you can then soak the strip of border, then place it on the wall and smoothe it out. Our wall is too textured though, making the top and bottom edges curl a bit. We LOVE the look of the border, and are hoping to make the edges more smooth with wall paper paste..."
4,Looks Fantastic! But has some difficulties,"My husband and I put this border up and had a few difficulties - mainly due to the fact that we had never hung wallpaper before and didn't have instructions. We had to buy a 2nd roll because we ran out and luckily found instructions on the back side of the ""Lambs & Ivy"" label. They were somewhat helpful but very brief. I don't think 10 seconds in the water is long enough so we soaked it a little longer. We also wiggled the paper around in the water to make sure all the layers got fully wet. I would suggest getting additional instructions from a wallpaper/border website. We also had problems with the edges curling up. Hopefully, the home improvement store will have some ideas to make it stick better. Overall, it makes the room look adorable!! We painted the top half pink and the bottom half green. It looks like a room made for a little princess!"
3,Instructions NOT Included,"My border didn't come with any instruction...even at the end of the roll. My husband and I would measure how much we needed and cut it. Then we dipped it in water and put it on the wall. We did the same for every piece pushing it all the way into the corner so the ends would match. It took us just about an hour to do the entire room. With the extra border, I cut out some of the squares, dipped them and water, and put them on the front of her dresser drawers. I also added one to each side of her trash. They will stick to almost anything and peel off if you don't want them anymore. A good way to dress up other things besides the wall. Next I'll be doing her lamp. I only gave it 3 stars because it was missing directions. But overall very cute!"
3,Cheap for a hard cover.,The book is to be expected considering the age and the edition but kind of stinks it does not have the dust cover. Other wise to any book lover if money is hard to come by there is no shame buying a used book on-line if you cannot find it in the store.
4,Delivered promptly; works well,We bought this memory card to use with our new Panasonic flat screen tv. It works well.
3,Gorgeous voice but dated instrumentation.,"I agree with all the reviewers: Amina has a gorgeous voice but it is not showcased to the best of her abilities.My favorite song is : La Mauvaise Graine, it's a very catchy tune.Some songs have Arabic influences and some others African influences.I didn't like the African influenced songs much and I was disappointed since I bought the c.d thinking it had Arabic Grooves.Some of the songs sound very dated such as Celui qui a parle qui a raison.It's a very old song from the 80s and the only thing new about it at the ti me was that someone with North African origins was representing France at the Eurovision.Otherwise this is a rather slow and boring song.For excellent Global Groove songs I recommend Natacha Atlas and Transglobal Underground."
2,HDD have instruction,"As stated by other reviewers, the HDD came as a stand alone, no instructions, no manual or anything. Unless you know how to install it, I wouldn't recommend buying this one. In my case, I used it for a game console and not as a PC HDD upgrade. Unfortunately, it is now just collecting dust since my console doesn't recognize it and I can't use it on my old PC."
5,Easy.No problems.,Just make sure you buy the right drive for your computer and download the software from Western Digitals website you should have no problems.Very nice.
5,What I needed,Needed this drive for an old Roland VS-2480 multitrack recorder. And Roland said you couldn't use Western Digital drives... :-)
4,"Good product, good deal","The drive works great, it was cheap. Only problem was it did not come with the mounting screws."
5,An excellent supplement or a wonderful continuation,"I used this book as a 2nd year grad student with a little more than a year of graduate algebra. It worked very well as tool to solidifying my knowledge of group theory. i think it would also work as a great book to read while taking a first year algebra course. The idea of the book is to teach theory grounded in examples. In particular, Alperin uses the matrix groups as the main example for the entire book. The writing is very user friendly and the proofs are adequate. It covers basic group theory concepts, local structure (p-groups, Sylow, solvability), Parabolic Subgroups of Gl(n,F) and at the end goes into modules and representation theory."
4,Excellent product for babies learning to talk,"This has been the favorite video for James who is now 18 months but has watched this since he was about 12 months old. His speech is clear because he has copied the speaker and says the words as she is saying the words and she pronounces them slowly and carefully. He also likes some of the Baby Einstein videos, particularly the ones with animals, but he goes to the television and asks for ""Bee"" probably because of the trains, buses etc."
2,Not as good as I hoped,"I got this video for our son who is 19 months and has not talked yet. He did not like the video and I thought it would be more then just them showing a picture of a train and the word and saying it once, and then showing a few different trains and then moving on to a new word. Our son loves the baby Einstein videos and we also got him the video called baby babble, which I found to be better, so you may want to check out that video."
3,A bit hyped,"My son's speech is delayed so I bought the first three. They hold his attention for about 15 minutes, and I honestly think it's because the music is so poor. Also, the way the videos are structured could be better. For example - I should not have to wait through the intro (you can't forward through it) to get to a point where I can hit play. And on the DVD containers, they should list the words that are covered in that particular video. I'm grabbing them, thinking, ""Is this the one with the plane and the duck? Or is this the one with the truck and the wagon?"" When your kid has favorites (e.g. he or she wants to see the duck), it matters."
3,Music too low,"I personally like to keep the volume low on the TV but with this video I have a problem since the narrator's voice is MUCH higher than the background music. Although the quality of the video is okay and this is a video showing objects (flashcards as another reviewer called it), I think I could have gotten better action for my money with all the other possibilities out there, such as the Baby's First Impressions series (of which you can focus on a specific topic)."
1,"Sooo stupid, amateur, low quality DVD!!!","This DVD looks like someone took a VHS camera about 15 years ago and filmed his own cat, dog, car... It was so stupid that I found this was insulting customers intelligence!!! DO NOT BUY this DVD!!!!!"
2,Baby bored,"I got this video on the recommendations from Amazon for my 6 month old. He was bored the first time I played it and now after about 4 times playing it for him, he seems like he would rather watch my back at the computer than sit through it again. He is used to the Baby Einstein videos and gets really excited when I play those. This one was a bad purchase. Granted he is only 6 months old and it is to help teach some vocabulary. Perhaps he is too young. But the video is rated for 4 months to 24 months. The sound quality is poor too and the woman's voice saying the words is drawn out...elongating the pronunciation of the words which sounds almost nothing like the words when mama and papa say them. My suggestion: Baby Einstein....especially the animal videos: baby dolittle and world animals."
2,Boring,Oh so boring! This video is simply flash cards set to music. I was very disappointed. My 10 month old would much rather watch Baby Songs or Barney.
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"I am a teacher that has taught for twelve years both in preschool and grade school. I bought this dvd for my son who is 17 months. He was born premature and is considered speech delayed and I was thinking that this dvd might help. I was very disappointed. This dvd is nothing other than moving flash cards. The screen shows several items and repeats the item's names over and over. I understand the concept, but it failed to keep my son's attention even when I sat and watched it with him trying to redirect him toward the t.v. The second and third time viewing he wouldn't watch it at all. This dvd is going up for sale on e-bay!Save your money and just use real objects in your house in which your child shows interest. Point to those objects, play with them, and name them. This will be a much more meaningful experience for your child. If you are looking for entertaining dvds that hold a young child's attention try the Baby Einstein series or the Sesame Street sing-along dvds."
4,An excellent choice!,"This is the best video for babies. My 21 month old daughter loves this series! It has really helped her develop her vocabulary early. My pediatrician was surprise that she was able to say more than the usual 15 words by 15 months. I love the fact that they use real objects instead of drawings or pictures like other videos I've seen. I also like that they use a number of examples to explain each word. The only negative thing that I've found with this video is that they tend to shorten words. They would use the word PLANE instead of AIRPLANE and PHONE instead of TELEPHONE. My child may not be able to pronounce the words perfectly but I'm glad she understands what they mean. I think it also helps to start such a series at a young age (they recommend 4 months). Although I started my child at 6 months, she finds similar educational videos fun and exciting."
4,well done,"I was becoming exasperated with the short attention span of my very active 20-month-old and his apparent disinterest in learning words that babies his age had mastered long ago. I was amazed at the response that this video drew from him. After four days with it 1 to 2 times each day, he is already saying words and remains completely engrossed in the tape, sitting still for almost the entire program. He now looks at words everywhere with interest, sits still long enough to have a book read to him and babbles intelligible words all day, associating them with the object.It is a simple format that is easy for babies to watch, especially ones of high energy (which I'm sure covers most toddlers). The speech is clear and the pictures slow enough to comprehend, fast enough to be interesting. The colored text and music in the background are indispensible components.I am very pleased with this purchase and plan on implementing the other videos in the series."
1,Not what I expected,"I bought this DVD because our child is raised in a bilingual home (English-French). The concept of a multilingual DVD is great but I did not expect the quality of the DVD to be that bad. The spelling of some words is wrong and the pronunciation too: it is not a native French speaker. I am looking forward to a DVD that would be multilingual but with higher standards. This is mediocre.If your goal is to teach your child many languages, do not get this DVD."
3,If you are looking for ASL this is NOT the video,"I purchased this video for my 2 1/2 year old son who's primary communication is ASL. Because he is still young and still learning sign language I thought these dvds would be great to add to his collection. Boy, were we disappointed. Maybe if you do not already know ASL the dvds are fine BUT there are MULTIPLE signs that are wrong and in no way ASL. We turned the option off because it was confusing my son. Besides that if that is not an issue for you they are great dvds. If you are looking to teach your child sign I HIGHLY recommended ""Signing Times"", excellent dvds!!!"
4,Great DVD!,It will keep your childs attention and has a nice snappy tune with it. Very educational as well. Much better than those boring Baby Babble ones in my opinion.
2,Didn't hold my son's attention,I was really hopeful for this to be a good find. My son has global delays. He's really progressing in all ways except speech. We work with a therapist but he's still not making progress. I've been looking at this series as well as the Teach to Talk series. I thought I'd check this because they had a the first DVD as a starter. We've been watching Baby Einstein Sign Language and my son loves it. I really need to put it on more often. This disc is nice but not as playful as BE. It doesn't hold his attention. I also don't like how they separate the signs from the rest of the visuals. That's what BE does well. They have the sign (with a child doing it quite often) and the word and visual all together. I'll send this one back and try T to T.
1,not happy,this product is no better than your baby can read cost around $20 and that has five dvds and real flash cards. So pleased I did not buy the full set at $100.
1,Aweful,"My 20 month old son is speech delayed and I bought this DVD based on all the positive reviews I've seen. Maybe I'm missing something, but I thought it was horrible. First of all, it barely held my son's attention. But the worst part was that I absolutely cannot stand the music! I could barely make it through watching it even the first time. Same thing with volume 2.We bought the Baby Babble DVD about 6 weeks ago, and I think it is much better than these Bumblebee DVD's. My son can watch Baby Babble over and over and over again."
5,Great investment!,"When our daughter was under a year old, we used to swear by Baby Mozart and anything in the Baby Einstein series. However, since she turned 13 months, we have found the Bee Smart Baby series to be the *best* investment. Our daughter (now 18 mos.) enjoys watching these videos and as she gradually learns the words, she excitedly names the objects when they appear on the screen. We read to her on a daily basis, but these videos have definitely increased her vocabulary tenfold. As a bonus, the videos have a soothing quality for adults- classical music and friendly/smooth voice describing the visuals. Highly recommended!"
5,Helped me prepare for class and for the exam.,I found my Antitrust course difficult to follow at times. This book helped me sort through the cases and prepare for the exam. It also helps you gage the big picture and how the cases fir together.
2,Useless,After a few weeks owning this book I must consider that it is really useless for me. I bought this book expecting supporting material for my LL.M.-antitrust-class. This book is maybe a good ressource for someone who wants a introduction into antitrust laws but leaves you helpless if you need some structures to deal with antitrust issues in pratice (or even from an practical approach like in an LL.M.-class).
4,Basic start reading for the begginer,"This book is both a begginer's obligatory reading and a consultation source for the practising lawyer dealing with antitrust issues. It is also quoted in many foreign books about the subject, for example ""Os fundamentos do Antitruste"" written by a Brazilian professor (Dr. Paula A. Forgioni) also because it is one of the most comprehensive existing/available in the market. In my opinion a book needed in any reasonable office's library. As I have read some parts of it borrowing from a coleague I will by one for myself."
3,Above college level,"My teacher only referenced this book, & said ""it was far to detailed and complex for college level studies."""
2,"Too Basic, Go With Rapid Rooters Instead","After a month of use, I've found that Rockwool is much too basic and needs to be soaked much too long, with ending results that are too inconsistent. Rapid Rooters are pH neutral, only need to be soaked for a few minutes, and have a much higher rate of success. Balancing my Rockwool became too much of a chore. The low price is good if you need to keep your cost down and don't mind the extra effort though."
4,good growing pots,"These rockwool cubes are a good way to start cuttings. Light, sterile, easy to handle and affordable. They do the trick."
4,Great for seeds,"These are great for seeds. I always get better results than any other medium I have tried and they are easier to monitor, easier to thin out and the will dissolve in soil.I have heard mix reviews for spray aeroponics systems and clogging from the dissolved medium. I use an ultrasonic aeroponics system and I have had no issues.They will develop algae but you can develop that same algae in soil or any other medium you just don't see it."
1,root-rot wool,"If your looking for a great product to mess up your system try this junk. Some people swear by the stuff me, every time i use it it disintegrates on to my roots causing a bigger problem."
1,Hellish camp or campy hell?,"This film is self-defeated by two opposing currents: it's much too silly and poorly acted to be taken seriously, much too sad and brutal to be considered good campy fun. I don't know what effect the makers were shooting for, but suffice to say that their aim was off by miles."
1,Pardon me while I puke on you.,"A flat, uninspired, meat parade of a movie. Didn't Theresa retire after this? Whoever produces Ken Russells's films has got to be the biggest con artsit of all time because his films don't ever break even. This movie's so bad, Burt Reynolds collects royalties."
1,Drowsyowl,"This book was ordered the same day as 3 others, but different sellers. I received the 3 other books within days. This order was placed on May 25, 2009. I have not received ""Baby Enchantment Rancho Encantado"" and have had to request an ""A to Z"" refund. The seller Drowsyowl, would not respond to my inquiries as to my order. I will never order from him again and i feel Amazon, should remove him as a seller."
3,Atlas of Foreshortening: The Human Figure is Deep Perspective,"The book is okay. My biggest beef is that a lot of the poses that the models are in are pretty boring and could have been more interesting. They seemed pretty repetative to me as well. However, it does over insight on the muscles shapes formed when looking at the body from deep perspective. You can then takes that and push it to your needs.It could have been better but it's not bad."
1,"interesting poses, bad position and poor quality photographs","The poses in this book are indeed very dynamic and interesting but the one MAJOR draw-back is that they are all with the models laying down on the ground. Definitely not a very practical figure reference book for an illustrator like myself. I mean lets be honest, how many times are you going to be drawing a figure contorted on the ground verses standing and engaged in some sort of action. It may, however, be possible too adapt some of the poses for a standing position and yet gravity affects the body completely differently when it is horizontal instead of vertical. The photographs themselves are very poor in terms of quality in that they are: muddy, bad resolution, slighty out of focus, badly lit etc. etc. etc. Basically this was a very disappointing purchase. The ""Fairburn System"" series is far better than this book for photographic figure reference material; however, very hard to find."
2,I think perhaps I am too pragmatic for Jungians...,"I found the autobiographical section of this book a little hard to follow. Could not understand how her life was structured, timeline-wise, and what actually happened.The journal section is clearer and more accessible.How do devoted Jungians find time to pursue all these symbols and images? The true weakness of this book is that I could not quite grasp how the author's inner work really related to her life with other people. In some cases, obviously, it is clear. But entire swatches of love, romance, child rearing, friendship, analytical work, are left out, leaving me agog with curiosity. What happened?"
1,Egregious,"Who produced this movie, a Wiccan? The ugliest anti-Christian (particularly anti-Catholic) diatribe ever brought to the screen, ""Nostradamus"" succeeds in being equally offensive in every other aspect, as well. The physician Nostradamus is portrayed as a trendy earth-friendly herbalist; the mystic Nostradamus is depicted as a Timothy Leary of yesterday, whose visions are ""enhanced"" by the taking of the 16th century's equivalent of LSD. The completely gratuitous sex scenes are to laugh, as they are always accompanied by a golden glow and Gregorian chants, or some unreasonable facsimile thereof. And the pretentious, obscure ending -- one either sits there jaw agape or one bursts into loud guffaws.Oh, avoid at all costs."
2,Not much different from a traditional baking pan,I have heard great things about silicone bakeware and decided to try this one first. It came in the mail as described. I used it to make banana bread and found that it browned all sides of the bread but it didn't cook completely inside. I have made lots of banana bread in the past without issue. The plus side of this item is that it holds shape well so you don't need to worry about it spilling as you move it to the oven.One strange item in the instructions was that you need to spray the pan before cooking. I assumed that with silicone bakeware you wouldn't need to so. The bread did separate from the pan about as easily as from a normal pan.Overall I didn't find any advantages in this pan. I probably will not use it again.
4,Nice Boots,"When I purchased this product, it was with the intent of pushing through thorny brush.As it turned out , the area I hunted had been burned out, and no such brush was there to test them.Truly water proof,they keep your feet nice and warm during the Hunt. However,the lack of a protective insole(shank) makes a long walks through rocky terrain a test of pain endurance at Days end.Good for flat marshy conditions."
3,Tender Touch Slicker for Puppies Small by Lenin,"The product description notes: ""The Tender Touch was made just for you!"", yet I find this non-discriminatory and egalitarian advertising method used to sell the Tender Touch Slickers to smack of Bolshevism. This product is not for everyone., as not everyone has the genetic competence to support its use. If your hands are too small to adequately grip the handle I doubt very much this product is for you.One further qualm: this product did not come with my insignia hewn from ivory and mounted on the handle as I so politely requested, further proving that this product was not made just for me."
3,Average.,"This book is an average supplement for the RIFTS role-playing game. I own most of the supplements for RIFTS and I don't use this one too much in my campaigns. Most of my players have shown only marginal interest in the contents of this book. It is an okay companion to the Warlords of Russia worldbook, but otherwise probably not worth the price of the book. This book is similar in character to the England world book. There is a lot of information about the folk lore of the region with a few characters thrown in. If you enjoy reading world books just for the information, then buy it. If you are looking for a world book for Russia, get Warlords of Russia instead."
1,PHILIPS MAGNAVOX PM64020 TV Shelf Topper (15x17,"Product arrived missing one of the two screws required to assemble and use it. Strangely, there was a second screw in the package but it was a different size, color and threading; it did not match or work with the product.The vendor made an honest effort to resolve the problem, but obviously could not do much to overcome shoddy Philips quality control in the originating factory.Overall, another piece of low-quality merchandise made in China and sold for a large mark-up; caveat emptor."
1,Phillips Magnavox Top TV Shelf,Its a piece of flimsy plastic junk. We could not use it for our DVD player as it slipped around and there was no way to make it more stable. It is currently sitting on the top of my computer holding a few sheets of paper and paper clips.
5,My baby loves this toy!,"He's fascinated with it. I had no idea it would be such a big hit. I bought it before he was born because it matched the colors in his room. At 3 months, he started looking in the mirror and cooing at himself. He's 4 months now and spins it around and seems endlessly fascinated with it."
5,A book I want to share with everyone.,"One of the best books I have ever had the pleasure to read. This anything but dramatic look back on the first twenty or so years of her life does carry a message - don't take yourself too seriously.I have read this book countless times, entertained my children reading chapters aloud and one year shared her description of a Christmas tree in a greeting card or two. I especially love the way she gives human personality traits to the inanimate ""characters"" in her story, like the stove, the mountains and that barely standing house she tried to make into a home. The human characters are memorable and entertaining, almost like reading a letter from a distant relative.As humorous as her recollections are, her descriptions of the sublime and serene can be poetic. Just an enjoyable read all the way around."
3,Gift,We bought this as a gift and got no response from the recipient. I read this books years ago and loved it
5,Lots of laughs...,"This book had me howling with laughter. It's the basis for the 1947 film, ""The Egg and I,"" which stars Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurray as the young city couple who take to chicken farming. It was written in 1945, and the portrayals of the neighbors and the locality are the highlights of the book, as the young couple struggles to raise chickens, produce, and a baby, while having to deal with the elements, primative living conditions (no electricity or running water), the stove that has a mind of its own, and the neighbors, including the infamous Kettle family (who later appeared in an entire series of films themselves). It's one of those books that had me laughing on nearly every page!"
4,the real Ma and Pa Kettle,"After watching all the Ma and Pa Kettle movies with my daughters, I bought this book so we could learn where the stories came from. My daughters enjoyed comparing the characters and scenes from the movies to what was in the book. Betty MacDonald, whom I knew nothing about, amazed me with her sense of humor. My 10-year-old commented on the unexpected twists that often changed a sentence into something totally hilarious. The only negative, other than the unkind portrayal of some characters, is that some sections of description were long and boring. In general, this was a hilarious book, and I'm glad we found it."
5,"Lovely, descriptive, funny and heart-warming farm life story","Betty MacDonald tells her story of living on a chicken farm in the remote back hills of the Olympic mountains, warmly and humorously. She has a wonderfully poetic way of describing everything from the green, lush vegetation of the state of Washington to a simple cup of hot coffee with thick, fresh cream. It is a delightful book which will likely urge its readers to seek out her other books about life before and after the chicken farm!"
4,So much for the romance of the pre-electric life,"If you are thinking of living off the grid and going back to nature, this book is for you. Chicken farming for sure isn't like this any more, except for maybe those ""uncaged hens"" eggs you can buy at Whole Foods. Still a life without electricity or indoor plumbing in the dripping Northwest is not what I dream about at nights. On the other hand the woman stuck it out and with good humor none the less even having been branded a ""reader"" by the neighbors when they all did ""tatting"" or ""needlepoint"". All those doilies you see in a farm house? That's a farmer's wife going slowly nuts.Anyway the descriptions of the Kettles is wonderful."
3,At least I can say that I read it,"This is the only book that I can honestly say, the movie was far more entertaining. However, the experience was not completely void of pleasure. There were quite a few anecdotes I did enjoy such as her experience in the logging camp, picking blackberries with the baby and the fire, although it seemed to me the author held quite a bit of animosity towards her husband, which for me was difficult to overlook. When I closed the book on the last page I felt good that I finally read it, but it did not leave me wanting to read more."
3,A good old friend,"I will always have fond memories of this book, which I grew up with. When my family moved from the city to a hut by the sea, this book was one of the things we took with us, and it was an old edition, hardbound and covered in green cloth. I loved the descriptions of American country life, but because I was young, the gender and race issues went right over my head. I haven't read this book in recent years, but I'm sure that I will see it differently now that I've gone to university and had a liberal-arts education. In any case, my memories of this book will always be good."
3,Depressing,"What a hard life the author had when she was first married. Although she makes light of her dificulties by joking, I can see that it was terrible and I found the book most depressing.It must also have been dificult to live in those years when everyone was so racist and unaccepting of different sorts of people. I'm surprised that she was comfortable being with the Kettles and uncomfortable with the Hicks. Based on her feelings of the native population I would think it was the other way around!I recommend reading this book for the picture it gives of the era that it covers."
3,"Well written, amusing in places, but. . .",". . .even her children seem a bit ashamed of what she said about Native Americans. I can accept that her description of the social conditions were a matter of ""calling them as she saw them"", but the statement that she ""[didn't] like Indians and [thought] that it was a wonderful thing that we took this beautiful country away from them"" made my part-Cherokee blood boil.I loved the Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle books, but this is the only one of her adult books I have read. When I re-read it, I always skip that chapter."
1,boring!,I couldn't get past chapter three. The style of writing is antiquated. I can understand why it was impossible to find a copy of it in the library system.
1,Racist stereotyping of Native Americans,"The author speaks several times in a rude and humiliating way about Native Americans. Maybe funny in 1947 but certainly rude and racist in 1998Amsterdam, Holland"
1,Left A Bad Taste In My Mouth,"I started McDonald's ""The Egg And I"" joyfully, until she launches into one of the most virulent attacks on Native Americans I have ever read by a contemporary author. The rest of the book was spoiled for me. I realise it was written in the 40's but it turned me off,totally. I agree with reviewer from The Netherlands."
3,seemed like a good idea.,"I bought this for Christmas. We live in Michigan, and I found out the ants cost 14.00 to ship. Its been sitting around waiting until i find some in the summer. the idea for paying that much for ants, that will prob die in an untimely manner is hard to shell out for this toy. The unit is smaller then i thought and it is only filled 1/3 with the gel."
1,Product came without power cord = very embarrasing to give as a gift,"The Fascinations Antworks came without one of the parts. Contrary to what it said on the Box, it did NOT come with an AC Power core = it's lighting system is useless! This was for a birthday gift and it was very embarrasing when they opened it up! (I didn't think I'd have to check inside the box to make sure all the peices were there.) VERY UNCOOL! and I'm very disatisfied."
3,A bit boring,"My daughter had ladybug farm and butterfly garden in the past and it was so much fun and very educational. This one is not so funny, not so educational. The first two days were great. When our ants tried to establish their tunnels and we clearly saw them working hard and building their new home. Now there are many tunnels and the view is very unclear. The ants all the times look the same and are doing the same jobs (the butterflies and ladybugs are changing). I know that this is very obvious but when I ordered this farm I didn't realized those facts. One more explanation. When I ordered the farm I was under the impression that I paid for the whole set( farm and ants coupon). No, there is only form for ants but you have to pay for the ants. There is no free coupons inside the package."
4,Whoops,"I got this for Christmas 07, and just got my ants (summer 08), since I did not want them to die in the cold. I ordered from the form in the back of the book, and 19/25 ants survived the journey. Not bad for a couple of bucks. But I wanted to warn everyone:This stuff is Gel. It moves, depending on how it sits. So for the last several months, I've had it in the box, sitting on its side. All the gel separated from from the edge, and left a huge area for the ants to crawl along the side. Its neat to see the ants up close, but all they are doing right now is tearing the side apart. Had I known the gel separated, I could have easily pushed it back, since its essentially Jello consistency. This was completely my fault, so I might get a new one eventually just to see how its really supposed to work.So I would recommend to anyone who might get this during the winter. If you are going to store it for some reason, make sure you store it standing up, so the gel stays put."
3,Electronics are junk,"PROS:- The clear gel is great for viewing, and it keeps things simple.- Lid fits securelyCONS:- NO POWER SWITCH so the lights are on whenever it's plugged in.- Power connector at base broke on day #2. We took it apart and had to re-solder the connections. Very cheaply made and surprised that they all don't break.OVERALL:I don't like my child plugging and unplugging things so the lack of a switch is a big fail for me. The farm is pretty small too."
5,Fascination of ANTS is Awesome! A++,This is a great product for Ant observation. I bought this for my daughter for Christmas after seeing one at a friends house. The product lights up nicely and it is very easy to see and watch the Ants dig around. Item arrived fast and just as described. Item is ready for Ants. I ordered Ants online and when ordering you can specify a delivery date so they come at the right time. Excited to see my daughter open this :)
3,Fine 'till they die,"We loved this toy. When the ants came and we put them in and they built fantastic tunnels. They were fun to watch and it was beautiful when lit up. My son loved it. But, alas, ants don't live very long and eventually they died (after a few months, I'd say). Many died inside the tunnels. So, now they are stuck in the tunnels and we cannot clean them out. I'm reluctant to buy new ants with the old, dead ones in it. Unfortunately, the live ones just seem to go around the dead ones or move them to the top and leave them. (I'm afraid to open the container to get the dead ones out, as I don't want the live ones to excape. So... for now, we're stuck with a container of pretty blue gel with ugly little dead ants in it...."
4,Cool New Substrate Makes Ant Farm More Interesting.,"Hey, it is an ant farm; not much to screw up! It is an improved version of the old sand types using a ""space age"" gel. It works as advertised. The gel, and the LCD lights shining up from the bottom, giving off a blue glow, make the whole thing look pretty cool.The one caveat is that the ants must be purchased separately. They are not expensive, five bucks for fifty ants. My problem is, they won't sell a queen. So, you can't really observe all of the ant type behaviors.After the original ants die (in about three months) I guess you could try to collect ants in the wild. That would require more research. Overall, a great investment. The kids love to watch them and by doing research and learning about the ants together, it makes for an educational and bonding experience."
4,calm fun,Best fun we have had with a toy this holidays. Mesmerizing young and old. Make sure you order the ants from a reputable company online ahead of time so that they are ready to install.
5,Great idea for kids and adults!,"My son recieved Antworks Illuminator for his birthday from a friend. We sent for the ants right away and they were shipped to us within a few weeks. About 12 hours after adding the ants to the gel, they had started tunneling. It was amazing! The LED lights are a great effect and it also works well for my son's night light. Our whole family has enjoyed this gift. I am giving it to my 11 yr. old niece for Christmas!"
1,Zero customer service from Life Studies,"The problem we are having with Life Studies is that they do not return my calls. We have called numerous times and left polite messages.We received our harvester ants the other day and the vial was crushed and all the ants were dead. As stated before, we have tried numerous times to contact Life Studies to order new ants. We are now taking the problem to the post office...guessing that the bugs got crushed in mailing.However, it would be nice to have someone from Life Studies to speak with, maybe request the ants to be packaged in a box instead of placing the vial into an envelope that offers no protective support. That being said, our $$ ant farm is still sitting empty on my daughters dresser."
3,Expected more,I bought this Ant Farm for my Husband... he had been asking for one as long as I can remember... and I thought it was going to MUCH bigger. Its SO SMALL! and then after we get it I find out that I could have bought bottles of the gel and made my own farm.All in all he loved it and now sits on our bar and gets lots of comments.
5,Facincating for hours at a time,This really is a great little product. My 5 yr old and I love to watch the ants and then see how far their tunnels have progressed each day. The LED lights on the bottom really light the unit up at night and make a great night lite. For those worried about the ants getting out - the lid is pretty tight and only comes off if you REALLY want it off. Make sure your child knows that these ants will bite so they won't want to take the lid off without your help. The first batch of ants that were shipped lived only for about 2 weeks (only 1 left) but they made some great tunnels. Overall this is an excellent product and I would recommend it to anyone.
4,ants!,I recieved the package...was really excited to set it up for my niece .the led light wouldnt light up the second time I pluged it in! The base is really cheap and I m having a hard time finding a replacement................update.....i ordered another one to replace the one that didn't work. My niece loved it! It was a great gift.
4,Fun for the whole family,"I recommend this product. It's super easy to set up and order the ants. Ours lasted waaaay longer than predicted, and was a cool conversation starter. The illumination also served as a nightlight."
4,Super cool ant farm,My students absolutely loved this ant farm. It is beautiful. My only concern is that the wiring in the lights came loose and quit working (hubby is working on it).
3,Ants are eating the product,"This is really cool, but the carpenter ants we ordered from them are eating the gasket and I believe escape is eminent. I'm not sure how to contact their customer support.Overall this is really cool and the opacity of the gel they dig in is spectacular."
5,My son loves it,This is so cool to watch. My son gets so excited to see a new tunnel dug by his ants. Its a fantastic night light in his room too.
4,Ant Farm,"Pretty cool educational toy. The ant farm is a whole lot smaller than I anticipated, but it's still interesting. Out of 20 ants shipped to me, only 8 made it here alive. The cool part was that the alive ants sequestered their dead comrades into a makeshift graveyard and then walled them off in gel. It took them about 5 days to start digging, but once they started it was fascinating stuff. Thumbs up."
3,"Cool, but needs adult set up help","Cool, but needs adult set up help. If it's not done correctly the product will not be as cool. And you can't fix it or start over again."
1,Beware:Stinging ants enclosed,Do you really want stinging ants to get out into your home?If not do not buy. There is about an inch anda halfspace over the gel in the container so lookingat the product you may think the ants are far enough away from opening of the container and will stay contained. The ants however when they dig carry someof the gel and build it up on the top area. In the instructions you are given it states that the ants need air to live and to openthe container to give them air. however when you do this you are giving them an escape. My son was terrified when some of the stinging ants got out of the container and into his room. I think they need a better design or more space in the top of the unit. Also I know they do not send a queen ant but who's to say whenthey get out they cannot mate with ants in your home. Doyou want stinging ants all over your home? I'm guessing not
1,Don't Waste Your Time!,"This product is not what it seems. It does not come with Ants, you have to order those for $5, supposedly -- but everytime you go to the website to purchase the ants, it says they cannot ship regular mail for the next 30 days due to the weather, but they would be happy to ship them to you FEDEX for $15. So, I would expect to pay approx $40 for a fully functional ant farm, instead of what is advertised on Amazon!"
1,I dont like it,Technically this worked like it should but i didn't like the fact that the ant's are tunneling cause there trying to get out and when you open the top to give them air they all try to escape i think it terrible to see that i fell sorry for them.
1,any ant go to,"PLEASE TELL ME, WHAT TYPE OF ANT GO TO GEL?????? I PUT, WHIT MY SON, 3 DIFFERENT TYPE, EVERY ANT DIE, AND DON'T EAT OR WALK BY BLUE GEL?????"
2,Not Happy,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my son. It seems to be ok, BUT the light doesn't work!"
4,NEAT!,Its really neat! Just waiting for the ants to come in the mail now. Alot different ant farm from when i was young. My child is so excited about it.
1,broke first day,I need help from this company and Amazon makes it impossible to reach them or the customer. I have this ant farm and didn't open it until I received the ants. My daughter is studying for a project so we are using it and can't stop using it but the light broke the first day. I paid extra for a lighted ant farm and the wiring isn't right. The first day we spent jiggling the wire where it comes into the ant farm and that lasted for a few hours but now it is broke. We have to use a flashlight to see in the gel. I want to get another one and transfer ants because I can't just throw everything away to send it back. Please help me fix this issue. Once I see how the company deals with this or Amazon for that matter I will update the feedback.
1,Ants are too expensive,"The ants for this are $5 each batch, which isn't bad unless you live in an area like Phoenix where it's 120 degrees and the ants arrive dead by mail. I had alot of problems getting live ants to use with this, and NO you don't get any ants for free. After about 4 months the gel started to melt and came detached from the sides, in the end I ended up tossing the whole thing out."
3,No Ants,It is hard to evaluate when there are no ants living at the farm. I read reviews that said to order from Ants Alive in order to get the ants in a timely fashion. Six weeks and waiting. Grandson tries to hide his disappointment.
5,Ant farm,"I have a 5 and a 9 year old, they are both girls and we all enjoyed this product. We watched every day and my daughter still uses this just as a night light, without the ants. Great choice for boys or girls."
4,"Great fun, but it doesn't last too long","This is a very educational ""toy"". The whole family liked it; my 8-year-old was especially fascinated.We ordered some Harvester ants separately; they started to tunnel almost immediately. The ants work very hard. They dug a full set of tunnels within the first week. After that, their progress slowed and they didn't dig much more. After a couple of months, the ants were mostly inert. And of course, they die after 3-4 months. This could be sad for children.I don't think it makes sense to get new ants when the first ants die. There wouldn't be anything for them to do."
3,neat but count on paying $10 for ants or collecting your own,Other ant farms we have bought come with coupon for free ants...I was surprised we were on our own to find ants...total was about $50 and I feel ants should have been part of the offer.
3,it didn't come with an illuminator...,"The blue gel looks cool but the one I ordered didn't include the illuminator! It also showed where multiple ""farms"" can be connected and that part isn't available either on the one I recieved. What a let down.Things to make this ""toy"" better?1. Make it larger! It's actually pretty small and whimpy for the price.2. Be honest and show what is actually included and what has to be ordered seperately!3. W/ regard to recieving ants...include info on where to get them when ordering the ant farm."
4,Ant Farm blue gel fun fun fun,Easy to set up and order the ants. I am sure they will make some cool tunnels for my son to watch. We are still in the early phase but are pleased so far.
4,interesting,"This is an interesting, low maintenance, pretty educational toy. Our friends, adults and children alike, enjoyed it :) Overall, a decent value purchase, in my opinion."
2,Xmas present gone wrong,Well this sounded like a great Xmas present untill Xmas morning when we realized it didnt come with the ants and shipping costs extra for the ants and is weeks before we see them. This would be a great summer gift when ants are everywhere
5,Niece's 6th Birthday present a big hit!,"I live several 100 miles from my niece and only get to see her a couple of times a year. I bought this for her 6th birthday. She was thrilled at opening the box and how pretty the gel was when lighted. Then I got an excited call when the ants arrived and were released. I got daily updates as the tunnels were dug. Overall, a great present."
4,Very cool,"This is my first ant farm, and I have to say it's been a lot of fun to see my ants develop a tunnel system in the transparent gel. The LED lights create a futuristic kind of feel, and are handy because you don't have to worry about having another light source to see what they're doing.A couple of notes: I started by catching some small ants behind my home, but they found a way to escape, I never did find out exactly how, but i purchased some harvester ants online and haven't had any problems. Also the gel in the farm didn't conform perfectly to the inside walls, so there was a gap that ants ended up sliding down into, but none died as a result, and the ants eventually dug in such a way that rendered the gap harmless. I did email the Fascinations website about both of these issues, but never received any kind of reply."
2,Could be dangerous,"Well we bought this for our 7yr old son for Christmas and a week later we ordered the ants.. The ants arrived in great condition (only 2 dead). We dumped the ants in and waited about 1 day for the tunnels to start. Our family enjoyed watching the ants for about the first month. The ants would make tunnel after tunnel for days, we loved it. But.... After about the first month all the ants (who my son named Judy because you couldn't tell them about, you had to name them the same name) seemed to be on the top with all the little balls they had collected from the tunnel digging.. They we noticed the little buggers all around the top of the habitat eating the rubber seal. I could NOT tape the top of the habitat fast enough!! I don't know what would of happened if we never noticed them eating the rubber seal.. I think this is an awesome thing for learning about ants behaviors and watching them up close. However... I really think they should have some sort of warning on the box!"
3,blah!,"I purchased this item for a Christmas gift, and shortly there-after placed the order for the ants...the instructions indicated that the company would not ship the ants out if it was too cold in the area of the destination...well, it was winter time in Ohio, and I thought for sure that if I placed the order now (just to get one chore out of the way) that the company wouldn't ship them until it warmed up a bit....but..I was wrong...they decided to go ahead and ship the ants out in the 20degree weather anyway...needless to say, when they arrived, ALL the ants, every last one of them, were DEAD....I tried to contact the company to re-order, but didn't have any luck, I guess they don't bother answering the phones...there's customer service for ya! :/"
2,not impressed,"i was looking for an artist on par with gianluca grignani, tiziano ferro, nek, and laura pausini, and came across biagio's antonacci's ""tra le mie canzoni"". i was not impressed. he has a sensual voice, but his songs were too monotonous for me, despite some very touching lyrics. i was not impressed and do not enjoy listening to this album, which contains tracks of live recordings, but antonacci's efforts are most notable."
5,very good,"very good CD, perfect sending, good timing, very, very nice songs!thanks!it is on my play list, very good!"
1,This is NOT the CD that goes with the Flocabulary books,"THis CD has been incorrectly matched with the Flocabulary books on Amazaon. Unfortunately they share a name, but that's it. The real music CDs produced by Flocabulary to build knowledge of English vocabulary and US history are not yet available on Amazon. But they ARE available at [...].If you look there, you will find the real music CDs.You can pretty much tell by looking at the track listings that this is not the right CD. Build your SAT vocabulary with songs like ""Pipe and Baggy""? Yeahhhhh, don't think so.I did listen to the samples for the CD listed here. Bleah, really, really sucks. And definitely not a vocabulary builder by any stretch of the imagination. ;-) But the real Flocabulary CDs are quite good."
1,pictures not centered on wooden hearts,"Yes the wooden hearts match the decor, but the quality is poor. The pictures on the hearts are not centered. I was very disapointed with the decor, and had to return it."
5,Princess wall pieces,I just love the soft pastel colors that set the babies room decor off. My little one loves to point and name the pieces!
4,Brought back memories!,"I loved Pound Puppies when they were on during my childhood and it is great that they have come back for a new generation. The new Pound Puppies is a totally different animation of the puppies but still cute. With talking animated dogs you really can't go wrong! The episodes are fun and the dogs made all of us laugh. The show is about a ""pup for every person"" and shows kids great lessons! We have watched the DVD a few times now and it has yet to get old for us."
4,Enjoyable and entertaining!,"My little preschooler said instantly... that's my DVD and we HAD to play it immediately. As soon as POUND PUPPIES were on screen, she was hooked. The dogs are adorable, the story is entertaining and held little *e's* attention all the way through each episode. The DVD features five episodes plus one bonus feature:Homeward PoundMy Fair ReboundQuintupletsK-9 KidZoltronBonus Feature: Learn to Draw LuckyFinal comment: Two paws up from little *e*!"
3,"Appears To be A Repackage Of ""Live At 25""","Was just doing some research on this, & thought I'd post to save you the trouble!Live At 25"
4,Better Than Expected.,"These are extremely cute and simple lined boots. My reaction may be exaggerated due to the fact that I got them in Storm Blue and so far haven't seen any other little hipster girls running around town in them. Not much support and pretty thin soled, but I do wear them for my 9 hour work shift with some ease, which would be greater if I just popped in some inserts. One factor to mention is that I originally ordered them in 7 1/2 (my normal size) and they were too big. Returned them for a 7 and they fit fine, with a little extra wiggle room."
1,horrible shoes,"I recieved the black shoes with a brown zipper ,my first compliant. Them my second wearing the brown zipper broke. I noticed they are not American made any more. Dont take a chanceand buy these shoes the workmanship is terrible. msskttty@aol.com"
1,TOO NARROW,"I liked the color and the way the moccasins were made, but they are just way too narrow. Please make them in a wide width. Couldn't even get my foot in them and I ordered a half a size larger than what I wear."
3,Minnetonka womens back zipper boot,Beautiful but even ordering a size larger than I am normally were too narrow for me to put my foot in. Will give to someone with a narrow foot size.Minnetonka Women's 299 Back-Zip Boot
4,cd cases,I really like these cases better than the ones that have paper holders for the cds. I feel that the cds are protected better in these cases. I looked everywhere for them and finally ordered them online for the same price that I once paid at Walmart.
3,Shadowlands,"The story was fine, but the quality of the DVD was horrible. I returned it. We were studying C S Lewis in a small group, so this was good material for our study, but it was very difficult, because of the poor quality. The return process was relatively simple."
4,Grab some tissues!,"This is probably Anthony Hopkin's best performance in any film I've seen him in. He does a superb job of depicting C.S. Lewis, the British writer best known for his children's stories, The Chronicles of Narnia. Although the film doesn't go much into who Lewis was, it focuses more on the love story between him and his wife, Joy Davidman Gresham, and her tragic death of cancer. Lewis, a shy, quiet bachelor, had no intention of marrying, and was quite content as a writer and a teacher at Oxford. Joy Gresham was an outspoken American writer raised in a Jewish household and a self-proclaimed athiest who had converted to Christianity. The movie tells of how the two met, eventually fell in love, and married after Joy was diagnosed with fatal cancer. One thing the movie also portrays is how Lewis was finally hit with a real pain of his own after Joy's death, and how he dealt with it. Even if you're not familiar with C.S. Lewis, this movie is a must-see!"
3,a mediocre cover...,"Despite the top-notch acting, I felt this movie did not approach the quality of the BBC movie, ""Surprised By Joy,"" which preceeded it by several years."
4,That's the Deal,"Pair with 84 CHARING CROSS ROAD, sadly available only in full-screen, for a lovely literary-themed Hopkins double bill.The DVD of SHADOWLANDS gave my low-end player fits. All was fine up to chapter 14, then at the end of Lewis's tearful confession (""I'd have to love her more than myself."") playback stopped and no measures could surmount that hurdle. Perhaps no more than a quirky copy, but I'm doubtful; after trading up my player the same disc plays wonderfully. One star off for player persnicketiness."
5,Shadowlands shines bright.,"Shadowlands as a love story is deeply inspiring. Shadowlands as a story of faith is richly rewarding. Well acted by both Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger, the movie is at once touching and inspirational. The true story of the later in life coming together of a Joy Gresham and CS Lewis, one of the great apologist for the Christian faith, Shadowlands has it all. I cried, I laughed, I grew in my faith, I was thoroughly enchanted. I ordered two more copies to give to my grown sons."
2,Don't waste your money,"This movie is not nearly as good as the English version. AnthonyHopkins is wonderful, as always. But Debra Winger has to be one ofthe worst actresses in Hollywood. She ruined this movie. I was verydisappointed. I hope Hollywood will make a newer version with a moreconvincing actress."
3,Good but not brilliant as such,"I lkied the film a great deal and it deals with the emotional side of Lewis's life at that time fairly well, but there are two things that I dislike about it, the first is Hopkins portrayal of Lewis, which is not much like the man at all, apart from the combative stance in his relish of debates. The second is the accuracy of the film, like many 'true stories' fact and fiction are intertwined, however the emotional accuracy compansates that and it works slightly well in some respects as an introduction to CS Lewis"
1,SHADOWLANDS,IT IS MY FAULT FOR CHOOSING THIS PARTICULA DVD. I THOUGHT IT WOULD PLAY LIKE AN AMERICAN DVD AND I WAS WROING AND NOW I AM STUCK WITH IT. I DO NOT KNOW ANYONE IN ENGLAND THAT I CAN SEND IT TO.DEBORAH COLESHADOWLANDS IS THE DVD THAT WILL NOT WORK IN AN AMERICAN DVD PLAYER.
2,poor quality DVD - film excellent,"The film is excellent, for all the reasons already given. However, this DVD version is very poor quality.It was the only one available that could be watched here in the USA. I had watched a friend's region 2 (European region) DVD on my laptop, but wanted to see it on the larger screen. The visual clarity is variable, but worst of all the speech is not in sync with the picture. This seriously detracts from the enjoyment of the film. I was constantly distracted by it.And at $38, when I could get a region 2 DVD of the film that works properly for half the price, this is daylight robbery."
4,A quiet un-Hollywood tragi-romance,"I am not sure how faithful this movie is to the original and true story of British author C.S. Lewis' romance to an American divorcee, Joy Gresham. Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger seem well matched to play the contrasting characters of the soft-spoken, shy, and retiring English writer, and the brassy, outspoken American poet. Winger doggedly refuses to let her quiet Oxford don settle into his comfortable emotional cocoon, and the superb casting and acting bring out the multiple emotions of character played by Hopkins from his introspective, affective restraint to deep love as the relationship between the two characters evolve. But this is no Hollywood romance! There are moments toward the end which seem saccharin, but overall this is a well balanced movie."
1,bad business,dvd not formated for viewing in usa!!! how do I get my money back???what the hell!!! Just another electronic dumping
2,tape issues,"I love this movie and was very excited to find it. The tape came wrapped as if it were new, but the first time I put it in my VCR (which I still use frequently), the tape got stuck and jammed the VCR> I was able to save the tape but now have to manually rewind it so it will not go all the way to the beginning, or it will jam again. Too bad."
3,Good,The movie was good; it moved a little slow. The quality of the VHS movie wasn't that good but it certainly was watchable.
3,the hollywood-ized version of an interesting love story,"When I discovered this movie was being made I was so excited. Unfortunately I spent most of my viewing time thinking, it didn't happen that way and WHERE IS HER OTHER KID?!?But, if you know absolutely nothing about CS and Joy Lewis' life together and know nothing much about CS and Joy Lewis at all, you will enjoy this movie. It is a well-made, Hollywood love story. The acting is excellent and the storyline is compelling. Just keep in mind that this is NOT how it really happened and PLEASE go read for yourself the true story.Oh, yeah, don't forget the Kleenex. It's a three box-er."
2,BBC version is far better,"This movie seems to me to present a very one-dimentional portrayal of CS Lewis. They take a single quote from a single one of Lewis' many books and keep repeating it over and over again as if that were all there was of his thought, philosophy, theology, or faith. The BBC production starring Joss Ackland and Claire Bloom does a much better job at presenting CS Lewis the man as we meet him through his writings."
4,Love that hurts,"For cinematic beauty and an exploration of the depths of real love, this film is certainly a crowd pleaser. Debra Winger's verbal and non-verbal barbs are classic! Those who have read Lewis' works may be a little disappointed by some inconsistencies. C.S. Lewis has been described as a man who could ""make a new suit look 20 years old just by putting it on"". In most scenes, Hopkins looks like he just stepped out of Nordstrom's. Additionally, those who have read Lewis' essays and speeches know that he had many remarkable things to say. The producers and writers of this film missed a great opportunity to introduce this element to a larger audience by filling the speech scenes with some rather bland unremarkable dialogue. While somewhat distracting, these items are minor as they are not the main topic of the story. The film does successfully tell the story of a deep love--a love that hurts--shared by two extraordinary people who did not marry at once, but rather married at last."
3,CANNOT GET PAST FUNDAMENTAL DISLIKE FOR WINGER,"This was probably a good story. It has been a long time since I last saw it. It was sad and I probably cried, but now all I can remember is that I do not like Debra Winger, and that this film was too long. Anthony Hopkins was superb as always."
1,"Woefully inadequate remake. Poor acting, poor directing.","The BBC Original drama Shadowlands could not be outdone. I don't blame the 'starring' actors for wanting to attach themselves to the drama but they fell way short. Once the 1990's version was made, it should not have been released. The original drama is moving, the remake is laborious to watch. The attempt to attach the Narnia concept to a green valley, robs the viewer of their own imagination and again falls short of the writer's and original versions' directors' intent. I have studied the original from many different perspectives and find that the remake is lacking in the depth and multi-faceted perspectives. Was it dumbed down for us in the USA market? It didn't need to be."
1,*YAWN*,"This is the most boring film I have ever seen. The soundquality is terrible and Anthony Hopkins can not act at all. Unless you want to waste time watching one of the stupidest movies of all time, I suggest you don't watch much less buy this..."
3,"""Lewis and water""","C.S. Lewis used the phrase ""Christianity and water"" to describe diluted versions of the Christian faith. This movie might well be called ""Lewis and water"", because it is certainly not C.S. Lewis straight up.The Lewis of this film is a man of simplistic belief whose faith crumbles at the first encounter with trouble. This is an extremely unfair depiction of the scholar and philosopher whose beliefs were well-reasoned, mature, and deeply held. It's okay to show that even this iconic figure might have had doubts at one time or another -- he was, after all, a fallible human being -- but not at all just to portray him the way this movie did."
2,Beware Amazon Pricing System,"I put this in my cart on April 5th at $13. When I went to check out on April 8th, the price had been raised to the list price of $20."
4,smells like pure evil,It came just like it was pictured in a timely fashion. The only negative is the price to ship. It cost me more in postage than the item cost. Regular US mail would have been cheaper and just as easy.
3,pretty good antenna among non-powered HDTV ones,"I have tried many HDTV antennas including Terk HDTV indoor, RCA ANT1251 Indoor Antenna, RCA ANT537 Indoor amplified tv antenna, and this one. Basically, Terk and RCA 1251 were useless. It didn't matter whether those were amplified or not. Those two didn't capture more than 5 HDTV channels. RCA 537 model was pretty good. Actually, it captured 5-10 HDTV channels and more regular channels if you play well enough with rabbit ear things. However, it consumes power and I decided to try this Philips one. At first, I was disappointed since it got only 3 HDTV channels, but as I move the ring antenna and rabbit ear ones, I have successfully got more than 5 HDTV channels. It is still not as good as RCA 537 model but if you don't want to use electricity, I think this one will work as good as most of other amplified antennas. As you know, the picture quality of HDTV channels are amazing once you get the signal. Usually better than cable tv HDTV channels."
5,Works Great with Digital to Analog Converters,"I recently bought a digital-to-analog converter for my TV and bought this as a cheap antennae to accompany it. A few years ago, I tried only having broadcast stations, but reluctantly bought cable because the reception was so bad with my amplified radioshack antennae. I definitely don't have that problem anymore. All of the major networks and PBS come in crystal clear. I wish I had spent the $10 on this four years ago instead of sinking all that money into cable."
4,Its an antenna.,"You buy it, you hook it up, it works. Please do not be fooled by any ads for HD antennas. Digital signals can be received with a tin can if need be. This antenna will work as well as any."
1,Save your cash,I purchased this to go on a small TV at home. This item picked up only one channel more than the built in antenna. The extendability of unit is flimsy and will not stay in place. They fall down constantly to the sides. Spend the extra couple dollars and find something of better quality. I regret this purchase.
2,Not as good as expected,"I bought this antenna thinking I can use it to view the NFL football games on Sunday's while in my office complex during the weekends. As long as you are near a window, the reception is great. This antenna works fine, picking-up 16 local channels including some HD one's. Unfortunately, my desk is not near a window and I cannot pick up a single channel.Overall, the device is OK for the money. It was relatively inexpensive. But it does not do the job I intended it to do, therefore, the so-so review. I think the manufacturer should state the fact that these devices do not work well inside office buildings. That way there is no confusion by the consumer when it come time for purchasing. My next attempt would be to buy a amplified one, but I'm not sure they would work well enough, either."
1,Doesn't Work,"Must have a short or something, my digital converter box can't find a station using this device. It seems more than passive."
2,Not much of an HDTV antenna,"I bought 3 of these advertised as HDTV antennas. They do not perform as well as the plain rabbit ears I was using, appearing to be too directional to be of much use, where the rabbit ears picked up all 12 digital channels here without moving. Dunno why that would be, but there it is."
4,Reception for tv,being able to turn the middle circular around as well as back and forth was helpful.
1,very poor quality and reception,very poor quality and reception. Replaced into shipping box and not used after initial trial with small TV. The TV reception is better without the additional antenna.
4,Good product,"I really enjoy this gate. The natural wood its awesome. So i don't have to worry about my son biting in it. Its fits the big wide opening of 72 in between our living room and the kitchen and keeps my son (and my husband ;D ) out of the kitchen. Its really easy to set it up, although nothing is said about assembly the gate, but it takes about 10 minutes and its up. So really easy job even if the little one was in bed by that time. Its holding good into the walls even if there a offset a little. We put it in the wood frame of our trailer and even the shaking from our son hasn't ripped it our so far.The problem is that you need space if you wanna put it up during the night for example. It takes about 50 inch I'd say, cuz it doesn't fold or anything. And you gotta be careful to step over it cuz it has a good high . But generally I can strongly recommend it if you have to block a huge gape of to keep those little hands away from stuff"
4,nice gate works well,i bought this gate to keep my puppy out of the kitchen when i cook and in the kitchen when i need him to be in one place. we have a large opening and this works great. we even went out and bought extra eye hooks so we could install it across the dining room as well.
1,Read Product Description Carefully,Just received this but found out that the Manufacturer description above is incorrect (lists 28in - 103in). Box and further down in the product description list dimensions of 57-103in. Will be attempting return.
3,gate,"The gate was fine, but our dog (Chihuahua) was able to escape by either going between the bars or jumping over so it didn't meet our needs for that, so we have a perfectly good gate that we have no use for. That said, I think for the right purpose, it would work fine."
3,It's ok,A little bit light duty but overall decent product for the price. Attachment to the wall could be a little better too
1,Not really a gate.,"This is really just a long fence, not a gate. It attaches to a wall with two eye hooks and one attachment will bend easily. It doesn't not function well as a gate. There is not built in gate, it's just a wall."
1,Good if you want splinters in your baby's fingers.,"This gate is wide enough to fit a large door way, and it seemed to have good reviews, so we purchased the gate. Sad to say, I was BEYOND disappointed. This gate is flimsy if stretched too far. Our doorway is 86"" inches and it doesn't cut the mustard when pulled that far. All said, the BIGGEST problem I have with this gate is it is ALL wood is poorly sanded. In addition, it had several areas of wood splintering off. No kidding...on a baby gate! What are they thinking? NOT something I want our 11 mo. old touching. As all parents know, if you put a gate some place, the baby is will go up to it and hang on. This is why we purchase the gates in the first place. The gate is getting returned today. Love my baby too much to let her get splinters in her little fingers. What a terrible gate!!! http://www.amazon.com/review/create-review/ref=cm_cr_dp_wr_but_right?ie=UTF8&nodeID=1055398&asin=B0002JETPQ&store=home-garden"
3,great for price,"We purchased a new home with beautiful wood floors and white chairs and squares. Needless to say I wanted a gate that would look nice. Being that we needed 3 gates, but only for a year, I didn't want to spend and arm and leg for them. We primed and painted these gates and added felt to the bottom so they don't scratch the floors. They are high enough to keep my 3 and 1 yr olds in the kitchen/great room and low enough to step over. So far I'm happy and probably saved at least $100. If we had needed gates longer, I would have gotten something a bit more durable, but my 3 year old was comfortably climbing stairs at 2 1/2, so I anticipate the same with my 15 month old in a year."
5,Highly recommend for pets,"I bought this gate to contain my pets in one part of the house. I have small and big dogs and none of them can fit through or jump over this fence. I LOVE how long it extends, which was a lot of the trouble I was having was to find one that was long enough from wall to wall.I wouldn't necessarily use this for a child; but for containing pets I think it's better than anything you'll find at a pet store!"
1,not for us,not for ubroke first day support did not have enough for this house . just to flimsey dogs just jumpover
4,"It Works, Just Plain Works","I will keep it short, it works. I have had this pet gate for almost a year and it keeps my 57 pound golden retriever in the kitchen/dinning room area when we are out. Easy to set up just use a pencil, ruler, and electric drill/screw driver. The reason for the 4 stars is they could make it look a little nicer with a stained wood and make it feel a little more sturdy to the touch. But then again for under $40.00 what do you want. Just in case you'r wondering I use it fully extended and their has never been an issue with it. Come off the wall easy for storage."
2,Hardware needs help...,"I purchased this gate to put between my kitchen and living room to try to manage my toddler. I purchased a different gate for the entrance between the hallway and the living room, and I was hoping to save a little bit of money by purchasing this one... that was a mistake. The gate itself is well crafted, but the hardware leaves a lot to be desired. The ""latches"" included are actually what look like eye hooks that screw in to the wall and whenever you open the gate and attempt to close it back, the hook has turned and you have to screw it back in to close the gate. Additionally the metal ""hinge"" on the bottom of our gate bent. Currently it holds our 8 month old daughter, but I dont think it will for long... disappointed..."
2,Broken gate within 1 week,"This gate is a perfect size for our house. But once installed, two of the clasps broke off the two pieces of the gate. We cannot put it together and are using it with two separated pieces. We will have to find something to keep it safe and can be used reliably."
4,Great Product,Use this gate for our 9 month old son we have an extra wide opening. One minor drawback is the screws seem to get a little loose and have to be tightened every once in awhile. All and all it is a very good product.
4,Great for puppies,We bought this gate to keep our Labrador puppy out of the living room. Since the opening between the rooms is quite broad we needed a wide gate. The gate is also tall enough that she will not be able to jump over it until she is fairly big. The gate itself is a sturdy wood with nice swing hinges. The only downside is the latch is tougher to use than the product ad implies. Otherwise it's a good gate and the price is great. We saw this same gate in a local store for 89.95.
1,"Does NOT work for openings less than 60""","The packaging states that it works for openings from 57"" inches wide. We tried to install it on a 58"" doorway. The actual gate end-to-end, with the latches on either side, actually measures 58.5"". Add in the size of the bolts you have to drill in your doorway, and it's just not going to fit in any doorways smaller than 60"". And the latch is nearly impossible to open. After a lot of cursing, we're sending this back and shelling out for the much nicer Dream Baby brand."
4,"Excellent gate, if slightly awkward","The gate works beautifully and was easy to install. The latching mechanism is tiny bit awkward, so we tend to step over rather than open it, but it's exactly what we needed."
2,Not the best gate,I bought this to block the large entry into the kitchen. It lasted for all of a week before my son was able to rip the brackets from the wall.
3,Extra-wide Gate but not extra strong!,"While this gate is extra wide which fits the 77"" area I need to cover, it is not a very strong gate and we had to install a second one on top of it to keep the kids from climbing on it and bending it. It definitely is not a good gate for stronger, climbing toddlers which frankly is the reason I need gates!"
3,Decent value for a reasonable price,"I spent a lot of time searching for a wide gate and was frustrated at the lack of quality options, so I decided to go with this gate as an inexpensive option. While not the most impressive or sturdy gate, this gate is decent quality for what you pay (I paid $48). It is very easy to install, but is a bit cumbersome to open and close. Overall, I am satisfied. I feel like I got what I paid for, no more and no less."
1,Poor Engineering,"Who ever designed this gate has no clue what to expect from a 1 year old child. This gate is all look and no function. It looks great when you install it but had no strenght to resist a 13 month old child from pushing it in the middle and almost breaking it. If you plan on buying this gate be prepared to do a little bit of drilling and bolting to make it work. I was finally able to use the thing only after I bought four #8-32 x 1 3/4"" long screws with matching washers and nuts and bolted the middle of the gate together. I did this by unscrewing the original connection at the middle of the gate and overlapped the pieces together about 6"" then drilling two holes about 4"" apart on the top and bottom rails and bolting together. It works! But it's not what someone should have to do after spending thie price for something. Good luck!!!"
3,North State Supergate Extra Purchase Review at Amazon,"The gate was easy to install and fit the width of the opening exactly, however the metal brackets on top of the gate that holds the gate together in order to slide in and out started to come apart after a few use of opening and closing the gate. I had to reinforce the metal brackets with screws for it to stay on. Other than that the gate does its job with keeping my dogs on one side of the gate."
3,"Works, but Too Short","We bought this gate for our entry way, which is very wide area with a step that our 6 month old was trying to crawl down. It is one of the longest baby gates on the market currently. However, the product description states that the gate is 8 1/2 feet wide (102""), but the gate we received is only 94"". It is 6"" short! Unfortunately 94"" was too short to secure our entry way. My husband ended placing a 2x4 up between the end of the gate and the wall. We decided to use the product and keep it, as we couldn't find a longer one, but I wish it had been the length it was advertised. Otherwise, the gate latches well and is sturdy."
3,Longest gate I could find!,Looked high and low to find a gate with this length. It is rather thin and flemsy but is doing the job. It is to contain two dogs and I really wish I could have found something a little thicker and more substantial; this was the only gate available online in this length.
2,Not a swing gate,This is a slide gate not a swing gate. I was upset when it arrived. It has no secure way to keep it together and it requires you to own a drill to put in holes. The wood does not appear sturdy and once assembled it would have a gap in the middle and no swinging attachment. Unless you have a very wide doorway this item does not slide in enough for a single person to walk through. In my huge entryway this item would not work. I had to return it for a refund.
4,Great for the price,"We have a bi-level deck and our yard is not fenced so we bought this gate to put on the first level on the steps so that our dog could come out on the deck with us. The gate was very easy to install. Its not meant to be used to open and close or slide or swing it open, thats for sure but it works great for what we needed it to. Our dog is a Lab/Rot mix so it is tall enough for him."
3,"Good gate, useless drywall mount","We've had this gate for several months now, close to a year. The gate itself has held up OK even though our now-toddler stands on it. I keep waiting for the wood to crack, but, so far, so good. You do have to tighten the screws every few months to keep it secure, but that is no big deal. The problem is that it was ripped right out of the drywall on both sides within a month or so of using it. The kind of screws it comes with have to be put in by hand, and they are near impossible to get into the stud, which is the only way it would stay secure. Another possibility, which I wish we had tried, would be to use those plastic things to secure screws in drywall. Anyway, we have our gate held in place with bungee cords. It was just lucky that we had furniture near it that it worked out. We got what we paid for."
3,Not high quality but does the job,"As other reviewers pointed out, this gate is on the flimsy side, and is absolutely not for the top of the stairs.We use it to keep a 10 month old out of the kitchen, and it's worked fine. That being said, we don't just leave her in the room alone with the gate up; she's always supervised while in the room (living room). I would not be content with this gate for her bedroom, which is the one room in the house I will let her be in while being somewhat unsupervised.The gate must be taken down when not in use (which is fairly easy to do) as it does not retract as I thought it would."
3,Standard,"This product is exactly what I thought it would be, very light weight. It serves its purpose for two large dogs...."
4,Good deal for the price,I have a 9lb yorkie who the gate works perfect for... and a friend has a 4lb yorkie who can fit through the gate rungs with ease. I didn't screw it into the wall I just put it between the fridge and the wall and put a pillow up against the other end to keep it up. Cheap and it practically comes put together. The wood was cracked at one part where the metal clasps hold the other piece of wood next to it but my boyfriend put some woodworkers glue and masking tape around it for about 48hrs and it holds beautifully now. If you're looking for a cheap gate for a large opening this is perfect for you!
2,"Wide, but pretty weak","I guess this is a case of getting what you pay for. It's wide enough to cover the hallway area for which it was purchased. However, this thing seems like it's made of balsa wood, extremely weak stuff.If your kids or dogs are likely to see the gate and stop, then great. If they're likely to lean up against it or test it in any way, it seems likely to break to me."
4,Great Value,"Great Great Great Value. I love the flexibility of being able to install it almost anywhere in the house, and you can easily get additional mounting screws from any hardware store. Does it seem SUPER sturdy? No. An aggressive 2 or 3 year old could probably bring it down with some effort, but for my purposes it's working fabulously. It keeps our 1 year old away from the stairs until she can properly navigate them on her own.I would like this product better if it was finished. To finish it properly yourself, you would really have to take it apart, possibly compromising the safety. Aside from that, I really like this product."
3,pet gate,"This is a great gate if you have small animals or children. It is secure and they cant knock it over.. One problem with it is, we ordered two and one had bigger opening between rails than they other. We have small dogs and one can get thru the rails. The openings are suppose to be 2"" and on second gate the opening are about 3""."
3,Serves it purpose,"I purchased this gate to put in my mothers home when she is caring for my son. It was the perfect length to fit in her sunroom. Her opening is a little over 8 ft. My only complaint would be that the locking/latching system on this is a bit tricky. It's not as easy as opening and closing like some baby gates out there. You actually have to work at it by latching a hook on the bottom of the gate and then push on a very hard button on the top of the gate to then hook on to a latch. If it sounds confusing...it is. Other than the locking system, it is functional and serves it's purpose."
3,OK gate...husband needed to reinforce it,bought this gate to initially keep twin toddlers out of specific rooms of the house. It does extend quite far but the farther you extend it the weaker it gets. We had to extend it almost to its longest point to fit in our archway so my husband had to reinforce the gate with bolts ever so far. It is now permanently extended but it serves it purpose. We would have returned it if my husband didn't reinforce it because our twins would have definitely broke it.
5,Love this gate!,"I purchased this gate to keep two small dogs enclosed in my kitchen. It has been perfect for that job! It looks very nice, it was easy to install, and it was perfectly affordable. It may not be strong enough to withstand a large dog or child pushing/leaning on it but that is not a problem with my Frenchies. I'm extremely happy with my purchase!"
2,Not To Happy,"The package arrived quickly so that was nice, however when we pulled it out of the box one of the bars was broken. I now have a duct tape holding it together, and its not very sturdy! wouldn't recommend this particular gate to anyone!"
3,"Dog gate for 65"" doorway","I am using this as a gate for an archway between my kitchen and the rest of the house, for a small puggle. It is easy to install, took 5 mintes. The slots are wide. First day i had it up my dog (puggle 15 weeks) got her head stuck in it, 2nd day she got all the way thorugh. Had to place extra rods in the space to stop her from getting stuck again. Works because it is cheep and extra wide, but if you have a small dog/cat or baby.. be careful. They wil get stuck"
5,Perfect,"If you have a large opening or archway and you need to keep your toddler out, this gate is perfect."
2,A little misleading title,"When I read that this was a ""swing gate"", I took that to believe it had a door portion that would swing open. That is not the case. You have to mount this to both sides of the walls then detach one side to ""swing"" the entire gate open. It is not what I was looking for. On top of that, we got it because we have a very wide space in our kitchen that we needed to close off for our 11 week old Pomeranian puppy, but the slots in this gate are too wide and he can actually get through the gate! So for us, this gate is totally useless. Unfortunately, I discovered this on the 4th day I had it and I didn't realize that Amazon's free return policy expired 2 days after it is delivered, so we are stuck with this.We ended up purchasing another tension mounted gate with a REAL swing door which will be arriving tomorrow. I hope the slots aren't as wide so it keeps our puppy within it's confines."
2,Very Disappointed,"This cereal has a good flavor and generous serving size, however the ""crunchy"" bits are too hard to even eat."
3,"Highly erotic, but also pretty depressing!","I felt really sorry for practically EVERYBODY in this film! The two girls were lovely, but their lives were so wretched --- all they had was eachother. And while I enjoyed the eroticism of their lovemaking, I felt terribly sad at the same time. As for the bitchy woman they worked for, I even felt bad for her and her daughter, although she brought some of it on herself. A difficult movie to sum up."
3,Unbelievable,If you didn't know this was based on a true story you would never believe it. Fine acting but the story line is difficult to deal with. A good study in psychology.
3,TANGY!,"I WAS PRETTY MUCH PLANNING TO FAST FORWARD THROUGH THIS MOVIE LOOKING FOR ""GOOD"" PARTS.BUT I ENDED UP WATCHING IT AT NORMAL SPEED BECAUSE ITS ALL GOOD PARTS.THE ACTING WAS SUPERB AND THE STORY UNFOLDS WITH A STRANGE RHYTHM.I'M AWARE THE STORY IS BASED ON TRUE EVENTS BUT I THOUGHT THE VIOLENT CLIMAX WAS JUST WRONG.DESPITE ALL THE LEAKY FAUCET TENSION BUILDING SCENES I FELT A HAPPY ENDING COMING ON.I WAS THINKING THE SISTERS WERE GONNA TELL THE OLD FRENCH BROAD TO TAKE THIS JOB AND SHOVE IT AND THEN MOVE TO CANADA OR SOMETHING.THEY DIDN'T."
3,Not sure,"Hey guys, please tell me - do I have to buy this one or not? I like the title and the two girls in it and I wonder if there is a bit nudity in this one -- is so please tell me so i can buy it I want to see them in action....~_~..."
4,Haunting and Psychologically Mesmorizing!,This video was frighteningly shocking and utterly disturbing. This movie portrayed the hidden side of a relationship most of us do not come in contact with. The actresses were brilliant. Love is love in any form. No one can stand between lovers of any kind.
3,I got lost apparently,Just finished watching this movie. I remembered one of the actresses from the three part BBC miniseries Tipping the Velvet. Shes just as good in this one. The movies differs slightly from the actual story. and the build up to the murder was lost on me some where. I wish there was more build up of the women losing there minds or more drama between the two girls and the owners of the house. But it was entertaining for the price a paid for it and i may eventually watch it again so thats saying something i guess
4,More than a little CREEPY!,"I viewed this one knowing nothing about the story. It plods a bit at the beginning, but it picks up in pace and I was a little more than stunned. There is a good sense of foreboding right from the start, but it doesn't give the story of these two sisters away too early. There is something sinister in the air, and the events are quite shocking. Well acted, directed and filmed! There are moments of extreme tension, eroticism, and then and ending I didn't see coming. In the end, it's more than just a little creepy! Sometimes a family can be a little too close!"
4,From Headline to a Work of Art,"A piece of story in the police pages turns into a historical tale of ancient times, where disguised slavery was a regular practice. Sex was just a casual solution for the extreme solution and a way not to become mad, what finally happened when the two sisters were put in jail and set apart.//"
4,A hauntingly atmospheric mystery,"Midnight at the Camposanto is, for a British reader, stunningly atmospheric. The other-worldness of the New Mexico setting are unforgettable. For me, the best value was in the sensitive portrayal of the strange mixture of Christianity and much older native religion which has to be unique to this part of the world. While placed firmly in the late 20th century, there is a timelessness in the power of this religion over the individuals in the story that really got under my skin as I read the book. A multi-layered novel - much more than a simple murder mystery. Excellent writing, and a very original voice."
4,awesome,locally this would have cost me $[...] .. I priced it. It was packaged very well so no damage during shipping. Shipping cost was reasonable. Item works great and was a breeze to install.
4,a jewel,"1959 was a rich, and haunting book, and this second novel by this author is as well, I think it just wasn't reviewed or it would be hard to keep on the shelves. I rather expect to see it made into a movie...it's that kind of story. Some of the images from this work will stay with me always - and it's a book I could read again. It's about a complicated friendship, a loss, New York City, and a resonant time that's just past."
3,It had to grow on me,I just finished reading this book this morning. It had a very slow beginning but the ending was wonderful. I would definitely recommend this book to someone who is into visual images and plot twists.
2,"Visalia, CA","My alomst 5 year old son has ridden this jeep for 17 months now. We are on our 3rd set of wheels. Also the front end sags. This is a notable problem with this style PW Jeep. He rides mainly on concrete. I would recommend getting a different style PW. Like the new F-150 or new Hurricane jeep.. You are going to pay more but won't have the front end problem that also causes the front tires to wear out on the insides very early on. The cost in wheels will add up if your child put this thing to constant use. My other son has the Red PW Mustang. The frame is great, but the wheels are starting to split as well. They just aren't made for pavement. I would recommend avoiding this model jeep if you are on pavement and know it will get a lot of use."
4,Great riding toy for 3 and 4 year olds,"This jeep is great fun for older toddlers. My grandson who is 4 is having a ball on this. Older grandchildren are 7 and 8. Tight squeeze for them, but they are slightly heavier and it struggles in the grass - wheels do slip on incline; smooth tread; but still great entertainment for youngest. I would recommend to anyone with older toddlers; in grass must be in high gear - but still doesn't go too fast for them to manage."
5,Great Alternative Medicine Book,This book contains dozens of short essays from various inspired and talented healers. It's appropriate for both novice and expert alike. Each author takes on on a wondrous journey through the maze of alternative approaches to everyday medical issues. Easy to read and inspiring to follow these healers as they discover facts about themselves and their patients.
3,OK......,"I'm not sure this is what I was expecting, but I continue to re-listen to more fully understand the presentation. The concepts presented are fairly complex, and rely largely on the author's experiences. An interview format is used, and in some ways it's helpful, but in other ways it leads the presentation in a way a straightforward reading might not. Note: The last couple of tracks on CD3 were damaged when I received the set, so perhaps that last bit ties everything together, and I'm missing the whole point? One of the main points I'm taking away is the thought that when teaching (which I do informally in a social services setting), we must ""hear into speech"", and I believe this to be especially true with people living in generational poverty."
3,Somewhat interesting,"Actually this isn't a bad CD although I only listened to the first one and part of the second.It's done in a question/answer format and Mr Palmer is thorough in his answers.The first CD is on depression and suicide coming from Mr Palmer's own experience. And I must say, he did make a lot of sense.I started on the second CD but haven't finished it. These CD's seem to be something you would listen to over time. His speaking manner is much like a college professor which is fine, but not good to listen to for hours at a time.He's no Wayne Dyer so if you're looking for a motivational CD this is not for you.Thank you.MEF"
2,Abstract,"I normally love books like this, and this one came recommended by a friend, but I personally was disappointed by it. It just isn't written that clearly, and starts to sound like ""spiritual gobbledygook"" after a while. Still, I appreciate his intentions and don't mean to dis it because I'm sure it's valuable to many people; it just didn't do much for me."
3,"good, although I was hoping for more","I've been familiar with Palmer's work on education for some years, so I was very interested to listen to this extended conversation with Tami Simon. Like all Sounds True recordings, the production quality is high and it is attractively packaged. The interview takes many autobiographical turns, as Palmer reflects on his life (especially his episodes of clinical depression) as he nears his 70th birthday. Palmer expresses a lot of poetic, communitarian, liberal sentiments. He's well spoken and this recording could serve as a useful introduction to his work. Nonetheless, I am giving this only three stars. I found myself lost in soft abstraction, wondering how or if his vision could be incarnated, especially among people who are not academics or retreat leaderes, and who have less space in their lives for reflective pondering, consensus process, and intentional spiritual companioning."
3,Just Shoot Me,"An Undivided Life by Parker J. Palmer, just was not my cup of tea. I listened to five hours and I could ownly choose a few good things to say about this book. 1. Mr Palmer is interesting and has lived a full life. 2. His life I suppose is undivided.I possibly would have gotten more from actualy reading this book in the written form. I'm sorry I could not recommed this book."
3,3.5 stars.. would have been better in print form,"An Undivided Lifeis a five hour interview with Parker J. Palmer. He discusses his experiences with depression, education, and his passion for living a purposeful, fulfilling life. Although the audiobook was informative and interesting, I found it to be a slow listen that was was hard to get through.Since his book get such rave reviews, I would recommend starting with those first if this subject matter interests you. This audiobook piqued my interest enough that I look forward to reading his books."
5,True Self finds its way,"If you lost your soul trying to live life fitting the cultural norms, this book will help you find your soul and live life true to yourself, not to others. This book helped heal the wounds that were self-inflicted and buried deep inside of my soul. The author speaks from his own experiences, and I could relate to every word in this book. I am a devout Christian and found this book spiritually healing as well. Our journey in life is mysterious and entirely inexplicable to me but our soul knows our path and guides us through pains when things fall apart despite all of our intentions to make it perfect."
3,interviews with a beloved author,"It was not clear to me that this was not an audio-book! Whoops! Instead, it is an extended interview with Parker Palmer on the subject of living an authentic, soul-driven life.Parker Palmer fans may appreciate gaining greater insight into his thinking as he enters old age...but I don't think this is the right place to start if you are unfamiliar with his work.I think that most people would benefit more from reading his books. I really liked ""The Courage to Teach"" which deals also heavily with the idea of authenticity."
5,Fascinating Audio CD,"I must confess that I was unfamiliar with Parker Palmer. The title ""Undivided Life"" was intriguing, suggesting a holistic balance in our endeavors which often eludes modern man (and woman). I was genuinely pleased with the 5-CD set and the presentation of the material in a low-key, yet thoroughly engaging manner.The format of the program is an extended interview in which Mr. Palmer alternates personal anecdote and reflection in a voice not unlike the wise uncle who has lived well and seen much. He comes across as completely genuine and human, completely lacking the arrogance that often accompanies the offerings of those with a notable string of accomplishments.The author/narrator emphasizes the importance of integrity, balance, consistency and balance. Yet, far from being simple ""new age"" diatribe, Mr. Palmer draws in a rich tapestry of spiritual depth and meaning.I have listened to the 5-CDs on several occasions; each time, I discover additional wisdom. I recommend this highly."
2,Cheap,"Very cheap knife. Blade get's loose all the time. Very sharp, though it get's dull easily. Fun to flick open and closed. Not a butterfly knife. I got 5 for about 6 or 7 bucks so I thought it was worth the little money I spent on them."
4,trucker game,"the game is okay, I like some of the lingo in it. the people in the game are quite funny, some are alittle odd. if anyone wants a fun game this would be the one to order."
5,highly recommended,"Caterpillar Rescue is one of those wonderful, fun, children's books that are perfect for sharing a bit of computer time with the young ones. Preschoolers can click through this story about a child who finds a caterpillar and sees it returned to safety, with the adult reading along. The artwork is vivid and beautifully crated."
3,Weird Controls,"It is probably as good as i thought, but the controls are hard to work with. You kinda have to get the hang of it.It says you can go over edges but if you hit it fast you will lose stuff. It got boring pretty fast."
4,Doesn't appeal to everyone...,"The moment I played the game I fell in love with it. The music was quirky and refreshing and the gameplay was far from serious. It gave me a real break from other games on the market that have serious/complicated storylines and gamplay.I wouldn't buy this if you only like games that have a strong plot and goal. This game is really about rolling a ball around just to make it bigger, nothing else."
5,Total delight!,"Ok - KD is a strange game. You roll a ball around and pick things up. It sounds silly but it is hard to pull yourself away. I am not a game player - but KD makes you experience true joy! There is something so innocent about rolling around and picking up stuff. Also, the music is fabulous! I have actually bought the soundtrack and I listen to it all the time.Of course - like with anything, you will probably get bored at some point. But you will always look back fondly at those moments of guilty pleasure -- rolling up sushi, cow, people, buildings, and whales. Bliss!"
5,Excellent game,"Katamari Damaci is a silly, quirky, and strangely addictive ""roll up everything in sight into a ball"" type game.First Impressions: When you first play this game, your first impression will be that the develepors of this game were on very, very, strong and illegal drugs. But maybe one good thing can come out of being high, this good thing is Katamari Damaci. I can't explain the story, it's just way too out there, evidence of really strong drugs.Last Impressions: Your last impressions of the game will be just about the same as the first, a great and addictive game that you'll end up playing for hours and hours. But you'll still get the impression that the makers were on drugs. Hehe."
5,"Great, spacey game!","This game is great! It is a crazy romp through Japan-culture with an outstanding Jap-pop soundtrack. The music is so good you find yourself humming it days later. The plot: The King of the Cosmos has just recovered from a wild bender on undisclosed substances. In his altered state he managed to stumble around greatly and as a result knocked all of the stars from the Cosmos. Now the player, his Prince son, is assigned the task to roll up all sorts of earthly things and beings in attempt to make a ball (Katamari) big enough worthy to send back into the heavens to replace the stars.This game is addicting and is even better in a slightly ""elevated"" mind-set. I ""highly"" recommend it!"
5,Weirdest game ever?,"Okay, so the Japanese have given us some weird games in the past, and perhaps this isn't the weirdest, but it's definitely a shining star in the field.It's also incredibly simple: roll a ball around, things stick to it, ball gets bigger, bigger things stick to it.Music - great great great soundtrack. The songs will be stuck in your head, possibly at awkward times (at work, during the throes of passion, at a sibling's wedding, funerals, etc...).Game play - a few people say it's redundant, and it is, but for some reason most people never tire of it. The challenge varies by level, and is never ridiculously hard, but allows you to challenge yourself if the level isn't enough.Graphics - colorful and playful - this game was meant for children and probably for pot-heads, not for ""realism in graphics"" snobs.Final words: Play it. It WILL make you happy.Funnies for existing Katamari fans:http://xkcd.com/83/http://xkcd.com/161/"
4,Great game!,"This game is so much fun! My wife and I have spent countless hours playing it both individually and against each other, and it doesn't lose any value in the replay. The only reason I gave it 4 stars for overall review is that I would like to have seen a few more multiplayer stages, either in the battle arena or included in The World (though I don't know if The World opens up for multiplayer at all yet). Absolutely worth buying, even at retail price."
4,katamari damacy =),Fun game. Only problem is that until you get used to the controls it is easy to get a little turned around. Good graphics and game plot = A
4,Weird and Fun! Just Like Me!,"I got this for my partner for Christmas and we loved playing it! It's weirdly fun and addictive and my partner ended up dreaming about it more than once.The battle mode gets old after a few times and they need to figure something else out for that. The King of the Cosmos talks too much, too. But otherwise, a fun and interesting game with absolutely no violence (unless you count rolling up mice and such with the katamari as violence)."
5,Short but Sweet,"When I read the reviews and decided to order the game I still wasn't quite sure what to expect. The game certainly did not disappoint. From a quirky menu system to goofy but fun and charming soundtrack, from heavily stylized graphics to thoroughly fun in it's simplicity gameplay - this game shines. Too bad it was fairly short (less then a dozen stars to make) but there is plenty of replayability even if it wasn't for additional quests like rebuilding separate constellations or finding all the royal presents that are stashed on the levels by the King of all Cosmos. If you're not afraid to try something out of the mainstream - definitely don't pass this game up."
5,Fun,I have played this game before and its nothing special but it is a good way for me to relax and de-stress
5,ADDICTIVE,I have played the katamari for hours on end. The songs are stuck in my head. This game is addictive. Katamari Damacy is a quirky Japanese video game for playstation. You are the prince and you are given orders to push around a giant sticky ball by the king. the king is condescending and goofy at times. the goal is to make the biggest sticky ball (katamari) as you can in the amount of time given by pushing the ball over objects on the ground and making them stick. That is all. Eventually you can pick up people and islands and even clouds. Once you start you can't stop.
1,BAD GAMEEEEEEEEEEEEEE,WORST GAME EVER MADE WOOOOOOOOOORST DONT BUY IT IT'S A WASTE OF MONEYYYYYYYYYYYY SAVE IT FOR ANOTHER GAME DONT WASTE YOUR TIME PLAYING THAT GAME
5,Awesomest Game EVER!!!,"Ok, it may sound a little corny; the whole point of the game is to collect giant balls of stuff to replace the stars in the sky. But, in reality it is totally awesome! You can literally roll up anything in the game...even the ground itself (if you get big enough). And with extra challenges like unlocking shooting stars or eternal mode, there is a lot of replayability in this game. So order it already!"
4,What a game....!,"This game is somewhat cool and somewhat dumb. The mixture of both makes it great. The premise is silly, making stars from the stuff on earth as the prince of the ruler of the universe. The music is INCREDABLY CATCHY. Some boards have big production pieces as the music singing about Katamari and others just have someone humming a theme song. Either way, it will , I repeat - IT WILL - get stuck in your head. Perhaps for weeks.Now the game. It is fun. You start rolling around and getting the hang of it and then before you know it you are rolling peopole into your katamari. They yell and run away. As your katamari snowballs, you pick up buildings, bridges, ect. It's really fun, remember - it is dumb, but overall it is fun.Also, get a tivo 'cause they're awesome."
4,Unusual Japanese game,"I have an 80gig PS3 that's backward compatible.This game works just fine with it, haven't seen any weird glitches.You roll a ball around and collect as much objects as you can to get the ball a certain size before the time runs out. Simple and addicting game. The dialog is strange, but funny.Hope they make more games on the PS3. Noby Noby Boy on the PSN is pretty good and it's only $5....but it's no where near as fun/addicting as this game. Hope they continue on with the series."
5,"Great fun, one warning","This game is unique. You are the prince to a very quirky king, who assigns you the task of rolling a ball around in different levels. If you hit something smaller than yourself, it sticks, and you grow larger. You start out picking up thumbtacks and bottlecaps and end up picking up people, cars, then trees and finally entire buildings and islands. If you hit something too large it knocks you back. It is particularly fun to go to an area where you were getting kicked around, and come back larger and absorb everything.Several side stories and small videos will leave you saying...""what was that about?"" But it is all fun and the music is great.One warning - unlike almost every other game nowadays (Spyro, Mario, Call of Duty, etc etc etc.) You ""win"" this game very quickly - in 6 or 7 hours of gameplay, if you are good. It is over too quickly."
4,Severe awesomeness.,There's something beautiful about rolling up things. The looks of terror as helpless people run for safety...The screams of distress as they are rolled into the Katamari...The pride in your heart as the King tosses them into space...Er. It's pretty addicting.
5,this game is the best thing i've ever seen,"this is the best game i've ever played... ever... the intro movie alone is worth the $20. its playability is through the roof, replay value like you don't even know. in versus mode, you can pick up the other player if you're big enough. oh, and to top it all off: the best music ever composed specifically for a game.it ranked #4 in time's 'best games of 2004', beating, among others, halo 2. give that a second to sink in, then click the ""add to cart"" button, and improve your life and the lives of those around you."
5,Addictive game only makes you feel like your on drugs...,"This is possibly one of the most incredibly innovative and unique games I have ever played. It is suitable for any age and I would love to see more games with this kind of creativity pushing the gaming realm further. The obsessive collecting of objects by sizes with your ""Katamari"" appeals to any of us gamers who are thrilled by even the smallest little reward or trophy presented to us in games. Anyone who has ever gotten a little obsessive w/ a collection may find this game your new obsession. Wonderfully weird, the sometimes bizarre transaltion make for a rather funny title. The originality of game play reminds me of games like ""Populous"" ""Simcity"" ""Tetris"" and ""Super Mario Bros"" (obviously when they first came out) . Buy this game, it's worth every penny."
5,Simply... ostrobogulous.,"This game is obviously not plot-driven. In fact, it contains one of the most conceited plots I've ever heard of... but because the plot matters so little, it is incredibly easy to ignore, and so you just go your way rolling stuff up and becoming the stuff of legend. You start with erasers and thumbtacks, then work your way up to animals and people and finally houses and towers and Godzilla and islands. One of my favorite games ever and one of the only three I ever play on a regular basis (the others are Okami and DDR). Every time I play this game I laugh and smile. It never gets old. The music, which ranges in genre from techno to jazz, is just as great. I have the soundtrack and listen to it frequently.Don't at all be disheartened by the low-key menu screen. Just wait until the intro starts playing. ;)"
5,????????????? But FUN!,"the developers of this game were obviously on an overdose of every drug ever created! This is the wierdest game i have ever and ever will play in my entire life! But in a good way . . . the game actualy has shadow of brilliance combined with block and and solid objects. The game however is VERY fun! which makes me wonder about drugs . . . (just kidding, drugs are bad!) all ages will find a whimsical joy in this odd, fun, and blurry brilliance. Its a bragain, u have no excuse!"
4,Really fun!,This game is really fun! I don't know if it gets old yet but it is a nice way to relax and play a game. My only problem with it is that when releasing it in the US they couldn't spell it's name right...Katamari DamashiThat isn't too hard for the average American is it? There is no 'c' in Japanese. Come on Sony...you are a Japanese company for crying out loud...And for those who are interested...Katamari - a lump/a cluster/a massDamashi - a spirit/a soul/a ghost
3,Good for addicting play,"This game is good for the person that has relatively no coordination. You use the main joysticks and dont have to worry about the advanced play like newer games have. Last but not least, it's as addicting as Tetris for the novice."
4,"Amazingly fun and funny, but dissapointingly short","Katamari Damacy is an extremely fun and funny game, with a fair bit of replay value, which is good, as it is very necessary. It took me only about 6 hours of gameplay to ""complete"" the game, but due to the absolute absurdity of the game, playing through levels a second time (or fouth, or fifth, or...) to beat your time and size records can be just as fun or more so."
5,Addicting and random,"If you never tried Katamari before, it's nothing like your typical game. You play a mini prince who rolls a ball around and everything smaller than the ball will stick to it. It keeps increasing in size till you practically roll up the planet.-Lots of random things to roll up.-Epic ""we-were-not-even-trying-when-we-made-the-story"" cut scenes. (But in this quicky game it somehow totally works.)-Friends described this as a ""Crack fest,"" but it's safe for all ages and fun."
2,Not worth the hype.,"This game was recommended to me by several employees in Gamestop. I bought it because I normally like quirky and off-the-wall, cute games and this looked certainly like a match.Wrong. Very. It is painfully, mind-numbingly boring. As repetitious as Tetris and with script as poorly written and frustrating to get through as, well, something like Zero Wing comes to mind, you'll wish it ended as soon as it begun. I'm not sure how long they really thought rolling around a ball would be entertaining, but it lasted about 20 minutes before I found myself wondering, ""Is this all it has to offer?"". Giving it a good while longer I found, yes, yes it was. Luckily I was within my 7 day return period and got a small fraction of my time, in the form of cash, back. ""They"" say in the description the cutoff age range of 20. I'm almost 21, so maybe it's really the DAY you turn 20 you realize this game is for the entertainment of 6 year olds trying to master their hand/eye coordination."
3,Not much fun for 2 players,"I mostly agree with the other reviews- this game is way different than anything else, it is funny and it is fun.However, I think it lacks something when it comes to two players. It becomes really reptitive and boring after a while in 2 player mode.If you're looking for a fun game you can enjoy with someone else, this may not be right for you."
2,Nobody wanted to play it again..,"I bought this for kids that play Sly Cooper, Ratchet & Clank, Jak and Daxter, hoping this would be a nice diversion. Ugh, it was awful I thought. I tried to be enthusiastic about it, but it was so slow, the graphics were dated looking and it just seemed tedious to play. There was more dialogue than I wanted and it just never captured anyones attention. I feel bad for the person who bought it from me."
1,Are some of the people who reviewed this borderline?,"I purchased Katamari Damacy for my grand daughter, after reading some of the reviews that really praised this game. This has got to be the worst game that I have in my Playstation 2 collection. And I have over 100. There is no plot. My grand daughter absolutely hates it. Even though it is not that expensive. Playstation should pay customers to play this silly game. My advise is to pass over this game and add the cost of it to a much better game."
4,This Is VINTAGE Disco,just got my copy of this album....i decided to buy it on a whim.....i'm not disappointed at all. this is the disco you heard in the clubs back in the 70's.i suggest that you get a copy of this album while you can.
4,I Love T-3's Slo Jams...,"....and this one has a decent collection of Tony Toni Tone's slow jams for the listener's dollar. If anything is wrong with this, it would be the MIA slo tunes Slo Wine and HolySmokesandGeeWhiZ. Also, some folks prefer the longer version of Anniversary, but why freak on that when you got the Tonys' Al Green channeling with Thinkin' of You? The only uptempo tune I like of theirs is Feels Good which boasts an adrenaline rushed bassline and memes from those punk funk groups of the 70s. And I almost forgot...an excellent,excellent tune that you almost never hear them play on our classic soul stations--Lay Your Head On My Pillow--true magic, baby. Final verdict:This is a good CD that will embellish your collection."
1,"Decent content, but...","NO INDEX! IMHO, A book (especially one used for reference) is only as good as it's index. No index? No good."
1,Don't waste your time,"This no way takes the place of their old rolodex. I found it very confusing and too complicated. Instead of trying to be just a name and phone number reference, it was trying to be a psuedo telephone. Screen is way too small, bring back the old one that had a screen of at least 3"" x 4"". Very hard to read. I had to return this disappointed."
4,Great drives for the price.,These drives now run at a 300 mb transfer rate so a jumper on pins 5 & 6 are needed for SATA 150 users. Other than that they run great and are quiet.
2,Packaging/shipping,"I was surprised at the poor packaging and, returned the drive unused. Other than Amazon's packaging, the drive arrived just shrink wrapped: No manufacturer's package, no set up or installation instructions at all."
1,Misses Mark,"Tom Stienstra is a good writer and I especially like the columns and books he writes about California, which is where he lives and where he works. He knows that state well, but this book makes me wonder if he actually has visited any of the campgrounds in this book.In fact, most of the information in this book appears to be gathered from campground hosts and campground managers who rate their own campgrounds. That's like asking a chamber of commmerce president to rate his own community, and it is tough to get an objective review and a point of view from anyone with a vested interest.You'll find more accurate guides on camping in Washington."
2,It works ok.,I purchased this antenna at a nearby store when I disconnected my cable. I live in a strong signal area for both vhf and uhf signals. The antenna pulls in all the strong stations with some noise in the picture. The tuning circuit helps to fine tune some stations. There are definitely better antennas on the market and I would not recommend this product unless you are in immediate need for an antenna and can pick it up locally for fairly cheap.
2,It brings in only 3 of the 5 local HDTV channels,"I gave it 2 stars, since it was beter than plugging in a plain coax cable.I even took this outside with no interference and got very little in channels. What I did get was choppy and didnt always hold well. Oh well, you get what you pay for!"
4,We loved it!!,"Find myself singing the first cut...""do do-do-do-do do do do..."" from ""Love Came Down"" (not too loud--not cool in front of my daughter--it's her CD)!! Sure feels like Christmas to me! Stacie is such a doll! (From a 35-year-old mom of an 11-year-old who loves Stacie's music.) We saw her sing live at Legoland in California last summer, and she has an AMAZING voice. What a talented young lady--the Lord has surely gifted her, and she uses it to His glory. O Holy Night is one of my favorite Christmas songs of all time..the lyrics really bring out the true reason the Son of God came...""long lay the world in sin and error pining...'til He appeared and the soul felt it's worth""...Her heavy R&B version--honestly--took a little time to grow on me--and I grew up on R&B--Qunicy Jones, Stevie Wonder, Prince kind of stuff-- but I love how she thinks and does her music ""outside the box""--very fresh and different...something Christmas songs need!"
5,Stacie Does It Again,"Stacie Orrico's first album, Genuine, was incredible. Stacie follows this up with a great Christmas album featuring 4 Christmas classics, a remake of Love Came Down, and an Orrico original, Christmas Wish. This cd is great because the urban rhythm really makes it different from all other Christmas cd's and Stacie's beautiful voice has matured and grown even more. This is a definate A+!"
4,Funky Piano Trio With Modern Edge,"Ray was part of the funky soul jazz contingent that came to the fore in the 50's and 60's.His playing is very much blues and gospel based but with a strong modern edge.This is,I think,Ray's first lp,and it's a great one.He plays a mix of modern jazz standards,popular standards and bluesy originals.This record set the template for what was to come and is very highly recommended,especially if you like Horace Silver,Junior Mance, Bobby Timmons,et al."
1,new mommy,"The mobile is adorable and it matches the bedding set well. But you would think that they would make a mobile that would fit all cribs. I got it as a shower gift and set it all up then was disappointed to discover that I couldn't attach it to my crib, the thing that attaches it to the crib was not wide enough to fit my crib and it is not adjustable. So it is going back to Babies r Us."
2,Not really all that suitable for learners,"Georgian is unquestionably a difficult language for a lot of reasons. It would be good to have a book that teaches, say, the 1000 most important words, introduces verb conjugations gradually and simplifies a very complicated subject. Although the book does cover a lot of information, it isn't really all that suitable for learners. Perhaps in the next edition it could be revised to simplify the presentation of difficult grammar, to include more repetition of the vocabulary. It could be accompanied by a cassette of the vocabulary and the dialogues. That would make it much more valuable. However, Georgian is not an easy subject to teach and the author deserves commendation for at least making a brave effort. As to the comments of the other reviewers, perhaps they should be less sensitive to perceived slights. Why don't they write a book on Georgian language? Mr Hillary has made it possible for willing students to get a grasp of this fascinating language."
2,How to make the Georgian language even more difficult to learn,"I agree with many, at least, of the criticisms already voiced of this book. The presentation is too often indigestible and confusing (for one thing, Hewitt apparently expects the student to learn whole lists of verbs or verbal phrases, including ""you scratch your head"", ""you clean your ear"", ""you dye your hair"" and ""you wipe your nose"", as examples of particular verb forms), and the dialogues generally seem more Martian than Georgian (""How green the grass is!"", etc.). Could the author have been laughing up his sleeve?"
1,Manages to completely waste a very good cast...,"In my book, the very worst films are the ones that take a lot of talented people, all of whom have done great work elsewhere, and deliver them into a cinematic meatgrinder. ""Battlefield Earth"" is one such film, and ""Striking Distance"" is another.This film manages to completely waste Bruce Willis, Sarah Jessica Parker, Dennis Farina, Tom Sizemore, Robert Pastorelli, Brion James, and Andre Braugher, all of whom are tremendous actors who've done fine work elsewhere. But in ""Striking Distance,"" it seems that they were all in it for a paycheck, and little else.When bad movies are filled with hack actors, and were obviously done on a nonexistent budget, at least you know the movie couldn't have been better.But when you have a bomb like this populated with this kind of talent, and obviously the product of a serious budget, the problem is that the people making it just didn't give a darn."
3,A GOOD ACTION THRILLER !,"I saw this movie years ago and found it in a bargain bin recently, I thought it was time to give it another viewing. This is no ""Die Hard"",but it is a pretty neat action thriller that will hold your interest. The DVD transfer is very good."
4,A good yarn,"Not great ""literaure,"" as it were, but an engaging action yarn as entertainment. Good, complex and well executed vehicle chases. Restrained murder violence, which is more suggested than seen (good, in my book). A rather captivating leading lady (Sarah Jessica Parker). Some good character acting, e.g. the byplay between Willis and his policeman father at the beginning of the film before Dad gets offed. Much location shooting in Pittsburgh, you really get a sense of those rivers.Hey, it's only an entertainment. I didn't go to sleep during this one. Nil extras on the DVD, though, only a trailer."
3,WILLIS LIGHT,"Okay, so it's kind of a light weight movie over all, but it's got a great cast, and it's entertaining. That said, I'd give Hudson Hawk 4 stars."
2,Who's the best cop? Not this movie.,"""Striking Distance"" was one of the weirdest movies I've seen, because by the time the movie's over, you don't see a point to it. I'm not saying you shouldn't see it, but the fact is the plot is predictable and pointless. The killer is no big suprise, and the characters are just not as intriguing as John McClane or Martin Riggs. Playing Sarah Jessica Parker as a cop was somewhat confusing, and pairing off with Bruce Willis did not work; they're just too different. Although the setting was terrific and the cast allstarred, the movie is over-the-top and as unconvincing as they come. The scene where Tom and the killer are going head-to-head is actually laughable: the guy just doesn't know when to quit, and neither does the screen play. Personally, I think I could have lived without seeing this movie, but Pittsburgh is definately on my vacation's list."
1,"An entirely unoriginal, dull, and overlong thriller","What a bad movie! From acting to script, it was absolutely horrendous. I could go to any video rental club, walk directly to the ACTION or SUSPENSE section, close my eyes, and pull out a random thriller identical to it! I personally, just like most of the noted critics as well as the ones here on AMAZON who didn't like it, just can't understand why they went through all the waste of talent, time and location. It's even too dumb to be a time killer on a rainy day!"
4,Typical Bruce Willis,"This is his forte. I surely wouldn't be watching a Bruce Willis movie for the romance! Lots of action, and drama. Not a family movie.Cops running a muck in Pittsburg? Bruce attempts to clean the city up with the help of Sarah Jessica Parker."
1,One of Bruce's Worst!,"For every ""Die Hard,"" there are a half-dozen Bruce Willis action clunkers along the lines of ""Striking Distance"" (1993). This ridiculous crime thriller only succeeds in sending a few good actors down the river. Laughably bad and utterly dispensable."
3,"Fan of the film, subpar Blu product","I have always liked the film and had hoped when this hit Blu they would clean up the picture and sound.The picture appeared to get some treatment, mostly with the vibrancy of certain colors (Sarah Jessica Parker's red dress) but there is all of the artifact, grain and material from the DVD. There seems to be some softening of the flesh tones, but mostly in her scenes. The sound is the TrueHD, which sounded dull and had to real surround, even during the chase scenes.No special features, a dull menu and no real upgrades make this nothing special over the DVD, but I still enjoyed reliving the cornball story, acting and seeing Bruce during his 17-film run in the early nineties."
4,Vintage Bruce Willis outing.,"If you like hard hitting, no-nonsense, gut wrenching action performed by a realistic and honest actor who always manages to do the right and fair thing, you will find that here, as in all of Bruce Willis' movies. They leave you satisfied at the end and a little out of breath, but every thing has been put right before it is all over. This one is full of action as always and he has the requisite number of close calls, but comes out the winner of the girl and the game. It also presents a good exposure of the city of Pittsburg and its water front on the rivers that meet there to form the mighty Ohio River."
4,"Whirlwind of Willis, Dumped Bodies, and Bad Guys","Renegade-type Cop Willis gets a water buddy (Parker) as they screen the waterways around Philly. Female bodies start getting dumped, but Willis gets weird notifications before the putrid acts are committed. The chief in charge won't believe that there's a connection between all the murders, although everyone else believes to the contrary, but he may have a hidden motivation. This is an action packed film, of course, with romance thrown in for further interest."
3,1/2 n 1/2,"the tracks on this cd are decent but half the songs on here are played out. its something you might wanna get, just to have but if you play it out yourself you'll never wanna hear this cd again. the source has always held it down but with the way hip hop was in 2k, its hard to put together a good cd without having the same three artists over n over again.definetly check out the source hip hop hits volume one and three, you'll see that this cd cant compare. still there were some tight tracks on there you need to hear cuz i know they need more exposure; 04. Bonnie And Shyne - Shyne 06. The Blast - Talib Kweli & Hi-Tek - classic 10. Gravel Pit - Wu Tang Clan - different style from RZA but decent 11. Look Me In My Eyes - Scarface - banger 15. Ante Up (Robbing-Hoods Theory) - M.O.P. - tight 17. Keep It Thoro - Prodigy of Mobb Deep - raw beat"
5,super fantastic,"bought a new truck and these are better than any stock item available, and they look great. 5 stars for thick rubber construction and length."
5,Excellent quality,"The quality of the product is great, it's a licensed GM product. Fast delivery. I live in a foreign country, it seems to me that they are a little expensive, buth worth the purchase."
5,Very cute book,Super cute book. Our daughter loves peek-a-boo and thinks that this book is hilarious. she likes the different animals and the sounds that we (the readers) make. she has started to mimic them too!
4,Alaska with kids,This book is mostly for teenage kids traveling by cruise to Alaska; however it gives adults quick and easy info as well. It covers all you can do in Alaska. It is simple to read and understand and very informative. It offers many ideas and tips to be prepare. It has fun activities at the end of the chapters and many web sites to get more info or resources. It ends with a chapter about Vancouver and Seattle and a mini diary for the kids to record their adventure. I used it to prepare my 4 and 6 years old children while on the trip. We all learned a lot.
5,This guy should get more acclaim.,"When I was down in Shreveport some of my friends told me about this guy. I picked up a copy of this CD and thought it was pretty good. I didn't think about it for a while and then put it on again. I've listened to it almost every day for two weeks. Great lyrics, great voice, great music and hot guitar. This guy should get more acclaim."
4,Mumbly magic,"This movie literally had me glued to my seat. The acting is heartwrenching and the music takes on a life of its own. I deducted a star basically because the garbled accents made it so hard to understand, I missed some of the dialoge. Watching this film requires patience and a love of youthful dreams and screaming guitars. I highly recommend it to anyone who savors rock n' roll movies and teenage violence. It's hard to find on DVD (if it's even been released), but try and get a copy to see for yourself."
4,Almost flawless,"I only have two technical qualms with ""Quadrophenia.""1-The mix of the movie is awfully, awfully muddy. I've seen it both in the theatre (albeit several years after the release in a university theatre) and on video. I hope they've gone back and worked on it, with the Dolby and all.2-Like most English movies from the 70's, the transfer of the film, that is, the way that it is colored just before the film is released, could've been pushed a lot harder. Makes it look dated, which I guess is sort of good, as it is a snapshot of an era.Otherwise, I gotta chime in with the fact that the film-perhaps more than any other film-really influenced my life. It did for me what ""Catcher in the Rye"" did for a lot of other people. I own very few films, maybe five or six. This is one of them."
5,Great DVD just a couple of glitches,"I had been waiting for this new transfer for years and I was not disappointed on arrival, this DVD is cram packed with features and a real enjoyment, there is a nice touch with a split screen of the old and new transfer of the film which is good to compare, the only problem was two scenes are ommitted from the movie, there is one seen where Phil Daniels says to Leslie Ash ""what do you mean am I gonna be one of the faces, I AM one of the faces"" now that was a line I used to shout round the school yard, we all did, the other is Phil Davis where they ridicule him and call him Chalky the ponce.. NOt essential but still I was left wondering why.. Overall this will not spoil the enjoyment of this excellent film and it was about time somebody did it justice and updated the print... Very Recommended.."
5,Awesome,"I only came by this film after seeing it constantly referenced in the book 'You Are Here' by Steve Horsfall. It has to be one of the best films I have ever seen - it's gritty, fast moving and superbly acted. Made in the 70's, this film will never date, although it was fun seeing a young Ray Winston and Sting (of all people). The music rocks too."
5,One of the better movies,"Quadrophenia is a great glimpse into the early 60's mods / rocker conflict in England. It also is a great story of a young man's angst while growing up and finding his way in life as he deal with his identity, work, drugs, friends, and love.While the movie features music from the Who's album Quadrophenia, it iis only used to set the mood and help the story along. It is not a rock movie, it is a period drama. The movie features a lot of great music from the period, early 60's, while Quadrophenia was released much later (1978?).I recommend this movie to everyone, not just Who fans. It stands on its own merit."
1,Could have been perfect....,"The film is such a gritty & powerful snapshot of life in early 60's England, set to the stirring music of The Who, that it is hard not to get swept up in the whole atmosphere of it, however, the remastering to DVD leaves alot to be desired, & the fact that several important scenes have been left out of the film with no reason or explanation, not even a ""deleted scenes"" feature on the menu, makes the DVD release hard to enjoy & some aspects of the story difficult to get for the first time viewer.I would say try & track down a copy of the 80's VHS version, the audio might not be as good, but you get all the scenes & to be honest, the picture quality is no different.Sorry, but the DVD just isn't worth it...."
4,A Scooter love story?,"This is basically the same story as Saturday Night Fever. Two gangs, hanging out and one guy (focus of the story) likes Girl A but Girl B is the one that likes him. He won't have it and will do anything to get Girl A. This is a bit more dark than Saturday Night Fever. Is it the grey English weather? The 60's film? I don't know - but Sting is a stylin' mod on a Vespa GS and is the envy of the entire Mod community. It shows how old he really is. Watch this to truley see the historic rivalry between the Mods and the Rockers. Plus it has tons of scooters and a riot in Brighton."
1,don't buy it,"this edition of quadrophenia does not play in the USA. I am unable to play it in any of my dvd players or my laptop or my tower computers. I also tried setting the country in one of my computers to United Kingdom but it still does not work. Seller has ignored my comments and requests for refunds. Don't buy it, you get nothing for your money."
4,Is This Movie Really Good?,"i bought this move because i thought it sounded like a tight movie, not because i'm a Who fan. I was glad to see that The Who weren't actually in the movie all that much! But instead, Sting is in it for a few scenes. Now i'm glad i got it because its a pretty dope movie!Leanard Part Six"
4,Disappointing,I bought this VDV almost 20 years after having bought and loved the record (and later CD) but I was somewhat disappointed. It has not aged that well. The cinematography is dated and the actors besides Phil Daniels are not that great. Sting is horrible...Anyway...there are soem nice moments.
1,"Forget the Movie, Listen to the Album","As musicians, The Who were geniuses but as film makers, they were failures--and this movie proves it! Quadrophenia's plot is weak the acting, writing, and directing are equally abysmal.Although the album ""Quadrophenia"" tends to be complex and over-produced, it still has a lot to recommend it. ""Quadrophenia"" was also one of Pete Townshend's most ambitious and grandiose projects. Unfortunately, this grandiosity does not translate well onto cinema.""Quadrophenia"" the movie is, at best, flat and banal. At worst, it's an extravagant ego trip on the part of Messrs. Townshend, Daltrey and Entwistle. Fortunately, after this fiasco, the surviving members of The Who decided it was time to give up on making films and go back to making music. Unfortunately, in the ensuing years, they didn't do much better in that area either.If I could, I'd give ""Quadrophenia"" a zero. Bottom line: Don't waste your money on this movie. It's a real dud."
1,Poor..Really Poor,Don't worth buying this. You can call this thing (I say thing because it's not worth calling it anything else) a great loss of time and money for producer and custumers.
1,Horrible movie,"This movie is just plain awful. Sting's performance is unbelievably bad. Thi story is just stupid: Jimmy Cooper is depressed woe-is-me whiny boy who revels in teenage angst everyday. Only in the company of his ""Mod"" friends does he find some comfort for ""horrible"" life. Pure white boy pain. Sting prances about as the Mod leader (yeah, right) and once poor Jimmy loses everything from his dim girlfriend to his home and his belief in the Mod ideal, he tries to commit suicide, but stops at the last minute because he is too scared, like any sad white boy. The soundtrack from the Who is equally awful, since the Who were one of the WORST bands ever.In short, this grimy, cheap Brit movie tries to explain to day to day suffering of the poor white boy, and succeeds as an exercise in in self indulgence and pretentiousness."
1,"Good concept, useless product","This item was initially sold under the Sonoma Reserve label. I wonder if it ran into a copyright violation. It has nothing to do with Williams Sonoma, and now carries a Napa label. In any event, the concept for this cork pump apparently went straight to market without any testing. The needle is hard to push through the cork and the little pump is unable to overcome the friction that holds a cork in the bottle. Don't even bother trying it on a plastic cork. When I tried to pull the needle from the cork that was still lodged in the bottle, the needle pulled loose from the pump. The instructions say that, if the cork does not come out after ten pumps, then use a cork screw. Save your money and get a Swiss Army knife."
1,Disappointed,I have tried it twice and pumped like crazy and no cork came out. Very disappointed in the product. Would never recoomend this to anyone and will probably throw it away. Dee
4,GB104 Buzzaround Four Wheel Scooter,I love this scooter. I only had problems with the battery when it was received. It would not charge due to the fact it was purchased 1 year prior to me from Golden Industries and sat in the warehouse at Amazon. It took several weeks to get it up and running but it has been so wonderful. All the repairs were covered by the warranty by Golden Industries. They have wonderful customer service.
5,Buzzy,"This scooter has been a real plus in my life. New found freedom, easy to operate. I am very pleased with it. Tammy1321"
4,A must read,"A must read for individuals that want to understand the new social movements occurring within our times; the writers describe stylistically the rift that is widening on the issue of globalization in our world, and more specifically Mexico. The thesis is that the Zapatista movement is justified, but it goes beyond the normal rhetoric; this book is not meant to be taken as the only source of wisdom on the subject but it does help see beyond our economic goggles. An analysis based on sustainable development, cultural upheaval, and anti-globalization stance. For so long have viewed the world through the confined bifocals of economic language and hearsay, this book allows us to venture beyond certain overdrawn arguments and back to some more personal and basic arguments that we sometimes have forgotten the validity of. I haven't rated the book with five stars, for I believe its usage of language at times to be fairly abusive and pompous."
4,Good Movie,a really okay Movie a bout good and evil... a girl falls in love with a man unknowing his the deviland get killed by the prist in the 1800... then comes to life again in our time unknowing shes possised by the devilbut the church is aware of this and have ther man to hunt her down... and... ehhh nee buy it and see it hehe ;)
1,Waste of money,"Sometimes movies can be so bad they are good, you have a good laugh at how bad they are, but not this one. This was one of the most pathetic movies I have ever seen. It was just bad all around ... bad acting, bad script, the plot non-existent and what special effects there are , are very disappointing. Would give it half a star and that is for the opening scene of the movie. Having teeth pulled would be more enjoyable than watching this movie."
2,Mixed bag of a bad movie,"I'll give this two stars, because the production values are rather good for a movie of this budget. They obviously tried to make a good movie, but the acting is so off, off, off that it ruins their effort. The dialogue is spoken in ""I AM ACTING NOW!"" cadence and stage voice projection. The main male lead slips in and out of that, so at moments he is better. The lead actress isn't too bad either. The plot is stupid and it ends badly."
2,Really good promoter,"The packaging and promotion of this movie was much better than the movie its self. Muddled somewhere in the 90 some minutes was a good idea but the poor acting and disjointed cutting really hid it well. The lead actress shuffling around and looking as if she had to us the restroom for the first third of the movie was very distracting. We finally decided that she was trying to convey that she was cold, but we still aren't sure. The knife wiggling after being stabbed into the hero's shoulder made us laugh and I don't think that was the intended response."
2,Would make a good pilot,"I had high hopes going in, but the movie did not live up to them. The spoken dialog was amateurish, the plot was almost absent, several scenes appeared twice. The whole movie felt like a giant prologue to a much longer story. If the story was refilmed and cast as the beginning of a TV series it would make much more sense."
2,I hate to leave a Bad Review,I hate to leave a bad review but I was very disappointed in this book. I tried 3 recipes spent almost $60.00 on the ingredients and it was awful. You spend all day chopping soaking blanching and dehydrating. You have to plan the meals 2 days in advance. All the meals consist of the same basic ingredients. Nuts and seeds and seasoning are the basis for almost all the recipies. All the protien and the fat in the seeds can't be healthy despite that fact they are good protiens and fats you still cant eat in excess.There are far more recipes for desserts than main courses. There are better recipes out there if you want to eat all raw.
3,"An ""expert"" ?? NOT!!!!","This book is probably not the best there is in the world of raw foods. What I like about the book is the simple, everyday language, ease of reading the recipies and the usage of very common, easy to find ingredients.What I didn't like was:The recipies were very redundant; I can't eat bananas so that nearly eliminates a huge portion of the dishes. Within each category she just rearranges all the same ingredients. Not real creative.Since when hummus, stuffing, or salsa a main dish? The Pasta Mexicana contains no pasta. Why call it that? The Dessert section is 66 pages long, the Main Dish section is 35 pages. I usually eat many more main dish items that dessert. I don't intend on making that many pies and cookies.She lived on raw foods for under 2 years then wrote a book with no other experience in cooking or nutrition. She's not real high on the list of credible advisors."
5,The Pretty Earrings,I recommened u all buy these earrings there so pretty. And there cheap for the price. Its worth it. What you expect for this price 6.21bucks. Its worth every penny. I wear them everyday. I also get complaments on my earrings to.
4,Works like a charm,"Worked well for me, however it is much larger than the cheaper diplexers. I used two of them to split the Sat-in and out-to-TV on my DSS reciever thru the same cable to back feed other TV's in my home. Sounds confusing but worked perfect."
5,"Dance, Dance, Dance","This is one of the greatest disco dance cds ever made. We purchased the original album ""The Golden Touch"" back in the late 70's and instantly fell in love with it. ""Look For Love"" has always been one of our favorite songs, and it brings back wonderful memories of dancing the night away!"
2,"Did Cerrone have a ""producer's block""?","After three magnificent albums, Cerrone is now sliding downward, apparently running out of inspiration, at least temporarily. This occurs, unfortunately, at the height of disco's reign. This fact leaves one wondering what kind of musical jem Cerrone would had produced, if this album had been much better... The only track standing much above the others is ""Je Suis Music"".Folks, don't waste your money on this one; instead, buy Hot Record's excellent Cerrone collection in which you can find ""Je Suis Music""."
5,A lot of dirt on America's Team,Bayless doesn't pull any punches and looks like he has several axes to grind. A must read for any die-hard old school Cowboys fan.
5,Paul Collette's music ROCKS THIS WORLD!,My name is Stephen M. Deane Jr. and im 14 and going to IORNWOOD HIGH SCHOOl.I love Paul's music and it rules! My favorit song is BABY BABY!
2,Unsatisfied,I do not like the above product. There is no taste of Mangosteen Fruits at all. When I read the label I thought it was real MangosteenProduct.
1,watered down,I compared this mangosteen to the same brand I bought at a health food store and found this one was watered down and almost tasteless and much thinner consistancy. I would not buy from this seller again.
5,Top quality....top sound....earth shaking,"I bought this speaker with a cab that has 1.63 cubic feet .... I quickly realized I was limiting the usefulness of the speaker is a cab that could not compliment the colossal sound of the speaker. So I bought another cab and it has 2.0 cu ft. Now it is earth shaking. In my Jeep, I worry that my Jeep is going to fall apart driving down the road!! It is freaking insane.Here is the cab I used that worked for me.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013MWT12/ref=oss_productThere are many websites that talk about this speaker and how to build the proper cab.... I can not go that route.... but if you can it would be the best option for sure. Nothing better at any price (within reason)."
5,This Is The Best Cd,This is the best Cd I have ever heard and Well I love the movie It is so slammin. and well I am only 11 but I still like it
5,JAY AND SILENT BOB KICK [BUM],"This soundtrack is, to say the least, a perfect blend of styles. The imagination that this CD represents is amazing, and reflects Kevin Smith's personality and style very well. A single change would collapse the delicate balance of pop, rock, and classic rock. And Jason Mewes' mini-track is the funniest thing I have ever heard. There is somehting for everyone on this soundtrack, and I highly recommend it."
4,"""What the F*** is the internet""?","This soundtrack pretty much follows the same formula as the Mallrats cd, soundbite-song-soundbite-song, but the music isn't just alternative bands. There's numerous other soundtracks I wish did that, like Dumb and Dumber for instance. Anyway, The music is as diverse as PJ Harvey, Bon Jovi, and Afroman. Not every song is a winner, but most fit. The big plus though is hearing Jay, Will Ferrell and Chris Rock between tracks. It will take you right back to the movie, along with some ""doobie snacks"". Too bad the movie wasn't better."
4,BUY THIS SOUNDTRACK (but first see the movie),"This is not only a great movie but is has a kick...soundtrack. But you really should see the movie first. The cd is full of great audio clips, but some don't make any sense if you haven't seen the movie. And on that note,SEE THIS MOVIE!!! If you love Kevin's movies, this one is the best. It ties all previous ones together (exept Dogma, but it's mentioned). Characters from Dante and Randall to Holden and Banky all make cameos. The movie is great, the cd is great, and Jay and Silent Bob ROCK!!"
4,Classic,"This is classic Jay & Silent Bob. If you like anything they've done in the past, you'll appreciate this soundtrack."
4,This time it's personal...,"It's good to see that Kevin Smith, director of the movie that spawned this soundtrack, continues to be able to apply his warped sense of humour (which I love) to the music he selects. Where else would you find Bon Jovi on the same CD as PJ Harvey? If you like his previous soundtracks (Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma, etc.) then the chances are you'll like this. Good music, excerpts from the movie and Bon Jovi - what else is there?"
4,"""15 bucks little man...""","The soundtrack to Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back is a rather nice collection of eclectic tunes that fit the movie perfectly, though to me it's not as memorable as the Clerks soundtrack. Afroman's ""Because I Got High"" is hilarious, as is the tongue in cheek ""Kick Some Ass"" by Stroke 9. Other classic tracks by Steppenwolf and Bon Jovi add a nostalgic flair, while soundclips from the movie, especially Chris Rock's, round out a nice package. The computer segments are a nice touch as well, and Kevin Smith fans will no doubt eat this up."
5,"Easily Recommended, World-Wide!","This is an excellent pocket guide, useful world-wide.Covers antibiotic essentials, as of 2002!Includes SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES, GENITOURINARY TRACT, SKIN & SOFT TISSUE, GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT, LOWER RESPIRATORY TRACT, SEPSIS/SEPTIC SHOCK, HEENT, CARDIOVASCULAR, TOXIN-MEDIATED (toxic shock, botulism, tetanus, diphtheria), and CNS (meningitis, non-bacterial/chronic meningitis, encephalitis, brain abscess, subdural empyema), PARASITES/FUNGI/UNUSUAL ORGANISMS, HIV INFECTION, ANTIBIOTIC PROPHYLAXIS AND IMMUNIZATIONS, DRUG SUMMARIES.Highly recommended."
1,Returns are problematic,"I bought this camera for my daughter in Ireland and brought it to her there. It was damaged out of the box and she shipped it back to Ace Photo two weeks ago. We have not heard from them and attempts to reach them by phone about it get lost in the numbers game ""press one for orders, press two for government orders, press three for marsupials"" and so on. Only finally to get transfered to a message informing me they closed at 3pm on Fridays -- it was 2:30. I have not given up yet but it is leaving a bad taste in my mouth."
3,Sure Thing You Will Like It...,This guy was under-rated but he is worth given a chance... I have 'bout five songs that i like from this album and they make real mood soulful song....Mokgabudi J
3,$6 for cutting bun or fruit at the table - too small for a regular loaf,"This is small BUT it is a piece of maple and maple is a MUCH better word for a cutting surface than the ""Brazilian Cherry"" offered by the supposedly most popular brands on Amazon. I have been off wood boards since receiving an alerady split one by Snowy River.Ever since I got nicer knives, I feel guilty about slicing food on plates with any brand of knives.Warning: this is a solid piece of wood but it is the size of if not smaller than an adult sized hand."
3,"The Price is Right, but...","The cost of this collection was attractive, so I purchased on the assumption that I couldn't lose. The art itself is of a particular style, but quite usable. As with anything graphic, it really depends upon the individual application.I use clip art mostly in Power Point presentations to enliven what otherwise amounts to a bunch of bullet points. The problem with this set is that the resolution is low, so that by the time you enlarge the graphic to a usable size, it becomes fuzzy and low quality. In their native state, the graphics look great.I have used some of these to supplement my own collection. However, more than any other source, I have used the Microsoft Office collection of clip art and photos, which is almost all high resolution and can be enlarged. It's also free."
5,YOU GOTTA GET THIS !!!,"THIS IS BEST OF COMPILATION MAY BE SHORTER BUT SWEETER. SOME OF THE SONGS LIKE ""GOOD LOVIN' ""& ""WHAT I NEED"" AMONG SOME OTHERS THAT ARE NOT THE FIRST COMPILATION CD ARE FABULOUS. LOYAL FANS OF CRYSTAL WATERS AND THE GENRE SHOULD HAVE ALL OF HER MATERIAL. THIS CD IS PERFECT FOR CASUAL FANS OF CRYSTAL WATERS SINCE IT HAS HER BEST SONGS IN ONE PLACE. SIGNED... MUSIC FAN."
2,incomplete collection,"Whilst Crystal is currently releasing strong new 12"" material (such as 'Come On Down') another album is compiled of her older material. Following 1998's 'The Best Of' and the UK only 'The Collection' (released early 2001), this is already the third 'greatest hits' set of this dance performer. Unfortunately it's also the worst collection. Just like the 1998 official collection it focuses on album cuts rather than single remixes, which is always a mistake as her remixes are often much better. 'Gypsy Woman' is featured in an awful version and 'Say... If You Feel Alright' is missing. The only interesting thing is that it includes her rendition of 'You Turn Me On', which was previously only available on a film soundtrack. Other than that, it's more of the same and only interesting for fans."
3,Missin' The Main Piece,"I love 100% Pure Love and a couple of others, but I was very disappointed that they didn't have the version of ""Gypsy Woman (She's Homeless)"" that made her blow up. For me it's about the whole quality package, not a quantity of songs on a CD, which explains why I rated it as low as I did."
1,Not Fair to the genuine Crystal Hits!,"This collection YUK!, why do they include non-hits that aren't that good!, I would recommend better the 1999 collection ""The Best Of Crystal Waters"", but I'm waiting for a real collection that includes ""What I Need"" , the new dance club hits ""Come On Down"" and ""My Time"", and the fast version of ""Relax""(Lorimmer Remix Edit), I Know Gypsy, 100% Pure Love are her greatest hits, but this collection do not showcase her supreme dance queen title, I dunno know this collection just sux...not worth even the great cheap price. Not worth it."
2,Has a cheap feel and poorly manufactured,"This product is very flimsy. It has no weighting in the base and topples easily. Be sure and check the dimensions as the base is bigger than I expected. It seems it would have had a better impact on reception for VHF (channels: 2-13) given its being used in a 3rd-story apartment on a hilled area in the North Dallas metroplex. The outer (VHF) antenna elements are black (painted or plated) making me wonder if they conduct electricity well enough to actually work when fully extended. Perhaps the signals are just weak at this location, but I doubt that considering Dallas is a major-market TV area."
1,Useless,One channel only. I moved it outside just to see if it would get more and it still got one only.
4,Excellent for new / prospective computer consultants.,This book is excellent for new or prospective computer consultants. Ignore a lot of the negatives in an early chapter -- unless you haven't thought of any of them yourself. Nearly worth its weight in gold. Not that it is the best book you'll ever read but that it will save / make you that much money from reading it.
3,Written for the solo consultant,"As the founder and president of a consulting firm, I found Janet's book targeted not at the firm, but the independent consultant. This aside, the book is well written and covers all the topics an independent should be exposed to. The section on issues surrounding incorporating is particularly useful, as is Appendix A, which is full of excellent resources to extend your professional development."
3,"Okay, but she has a better one out.","This book is good for a general understanting of the consulting field. And I do recommend it, but if you are serious about consulting/contracting, you should supplement with two other books: ""Janet Ruhl's Answers for Computer Contractors: How to Get the Highest Rates and the Fairest Deals from Consulting Firms, Agencies, and Clients"" and if you are just starting in the programming field and want to learn exactly what you need to do and do it fast, then read: ""The Secret Path to Contract Programming Riches..."" Good luck to your career! ;)"
4,Practical business advice for consultants,"Know when you can start consulting as a sustainable business. Receive a reasonable fee for your services. Be prepared for the pitfalls of operating your own business. Hear about success stories and business strategies from practicing computer consultants. Learn about starting your consulting business, marketing, contracts, client relationships, and income producing consulting activities. This book is practical and realistic. The author has a negative opinion of Big 5 accounting firms."
2,Ms. Ruhl provides a view of consulting with a negative focus,"I initially purchased Janet Ruhl's book to find a guide to start a successful consulting career. (as per the sub title of the book). The book focuses largely on the pitfalls and traps of being a consultant and not how to succeed as one. Granted that knowing the pitfalls is an element of success, the book does not offer much positive information on how to be successful. As a reader, I was dissapointed to find very little in the way of proven techniques that can be used to be successful. The book serves best as a vehicle to prevent people from going into consulting."
3,The medium is the message,"I thought the book was okay. Not great, not bad. I have alsobeen in and out of the consulting game since about 1977, so I might bejaded. What I find much more interesting is what is going on with the author and the consulting community. I remember sitting in a therapy session (over a beer) with another contractor in 1983 discussing the project we were on, our scuzzball employer(very few independents in 1983), and what it would take to get free, make money, and in general manage our own fates. Much of what we determined as needed is discussed in Ruhl's books. That's exciting because it means that the knowledge is now commonplace, and the contracting community (and there IS a community now) is beginning to come together in a fashion that most of us will benefit from. That's the real interesting part of this book. Check out her web site. Enjoy. It's been a long, hard, 20 years."
2,Nothing new here...,"This book is just another ""how-to-be-a-consultant"" book by a consultant consulting other aspiring consultants regarding how to consult with other would-be consultants about how they, too, can be consultants. Get the picture? If you want a career in consulting, join associations, consult with newsgroups and other successful consultants, pass around your business card and portfolio, and continue to upgrade your skills. Don't think in terms of a ""job""; be opportunistic, cynical, and results oriented; listen to your clients and give them what they want...period."
1,Don't Do It,"Never had a chance to test this product out. Ordered it and three days later received an email that the order was cancelled. No reason given, just cancelled. Wouldn't trust this company at all. Not professional. Hard to believe such a shoddy business is doing this in the current economy. I guess they don't want to stay in business."
5,Love It,I bought this set for my son. We have had no problems with the set at all and our son loves it. I would highly recommend buying this one. There is also a lot of things to match this set!-Carrie
2,"Nice pattern, poor quality","I chose this beeding set because of the pattern. I was excited to have a baby boy, and sports was the perfect theme. The bedding set was given to me as a gift. After the initial washing, I had to sew the seam on the comforter. The crib sheet is very difficult to put on the mattress, and after a few washings it tore in two places!. The bumper pads do not fit snuggly on the crib, and only have ties at the top. I thought this was how all sets were made. I am pregnant again. Another beddingset was purchased for the new crib, and the sheet fits great, the bumper pads have ties on top and bottom, and the set washes better...and it cost less. Use caution if you purchase this item. We have to provide proof of purchase to Babys R Us to get store credit, which is not so easy when it was a gift."
4,My little all star,This bedding set is really great. My husband had to have it the minute he saw. The selection is small when buying decor for a boys room so we were exicited to have found this. It really is a great set. A little pricey but we think its worth the price.
3,It is perfect!!!!!!!,I fell in love with the all stars set because it is perfect for baby boys. All of the accessories that go along with the set blend very well together. I would recommend it.
3,"Cute set, just don't get dirty","I bought this set when we found out we were having a boy. I love the idea of him being able to grow with a sports themed room. I decided to wash the bedding before he got here, and the comforter fell apart in a couple of places. It looks like there was not enough fabric to be stiched and it seperated. I did not even put it in the dryer, this happened in the washer. I think for the cost, the bedding should last at least until the baby gets here!"
5,Very nice set,"I was hesitant about purchasing this bedding set because of the previous reviews that I have read. I washed this set, even the bumper, on cold and dried it on low heat. I had no problems with it what so ever. The crib sheet was snug to get on but I was glad that it was. Really a great set."
2,"""Baby League"" bedding set. falls apart easily!","I purchased the ""Baby League"" sports themed bedding set by L&I and the comforter fell apart after 2 gentle washings. The terry material started fraying alot. The pillow has also started falling apart at the seams (and it has never been washed!). Even though the bedding looks cute, the quality is not that great (esp for what I paid!)"
1,I think it's horrible!,"I thought this set was really cute, so we bought it. I returned it the day after I tried to put it on my son's crib! For one thing, the bumper only has ties on the top, which I think is generic, not to mention a little unsafe. Then, one of the ties just fell off while my husband was tying it on. The bumper also didn't fit correctly on the crib--that could be because the crib is made a little differently than most, but even still, it just seemed very generic to me. I took it back to the store and exchanged it for the Club USA Teddy Bear set, which is perfect for us!"
4,How cute is this?,"I found this and I love this look. My son is 7 months old, but this ensemble will never go out of style! I've found so many accessories that match and they don't even belong to this collection, it's great. The only thing I don't like about it is the comforter. It is VERY thick and my son gets hot under it. I've started just using it on the wall as decoration. But this ensemble is so cute and absolutely all BOY!"
5,Great for a little boy!,"As soon as we found out we were having a boy we registered for this bedding. I absolutely love it! I didn't have any problems with shrinkage in the sheets. I just washed them in cold and hung dry, the comforter also. It's a great price for everything you get too.Although I have yet to use it as we aren't expecting our little one for another couple weeks I already really love it!"
1,Got wrong product,still trying to return it. Totally wrong product. Was advertised for one thing and i bought that item but received something else. Having hard time returning for correct item.
2,Why is this rated so high on Amazon and so poorly on other sites?,I wonder why this movie is rated so well on Amazon but on a lot of other sites it isn't?
1,Fox should be ashamed - Continue to support DVD!,"Really Fox? This is the best you can manage? I'm pleased to see that DTS and 5.1 audio options are available on the Bluray disk, as of course is widescreen... but are you really telling EVERYONE in the world who doesn't have a Blueray Player or a Playstation that you are simply going to release movies on regular DVD format without 5.1 and with 4:3 screen format? My Home Theatre is capable of providing perfectly good 16:9 and 5.1 and DTS without me going out and buying a Blueray player... I have hundreds of DVDs here which play perfectly well in 16:9 and with great surround sound... Why the crippled DVD Format release? I'm not opposed to having a 4:3 format DVD if there's also a Widescreen version of the disk... but not offering a DVD based 16:9 is a serious mistake that needs to be stopped now before it becomes a trend!"
1,Alvin and The Chipmunks Blu-ray Disc,"I purchased this for my 3 year old grandson for Christmas. However, I did not realize it was a Blu-ray Disc. Neither my son or I have a Blu-ray Disc player so I really don't have a review for the Disc itself, since I cannot play it. I just wanted to make other customers aware before they purchase one that it does require a Blu-ray Disc player, Blu-ray Disc Computer Driver or a Playstation 3. I guess we will need to wait until either my son or I purchase one to find out about the Disc. I did receive it in a timely manner though."
5,Wonderful for everyone,"I ordered this DVD for my Grandson, this was the first movie he had seen at a theater. Now my 16 yr old has seen it and I have to order another one for her. The whole family has loved it! BTW, my Grandson is 4yrs. old."
3,Alvin and the Chipmunks blu ray,Great family movie blu ray. Reminds you of the saturday morning cartoon days. Good Picture quality 3 1/2 out of 5 stars.good sound 3 1/2 out of 5.not the best but solid.
3,Even my kids are tired of it,"I didn't write a review right away, and now I'm glad I didn't. We grabbed the DVD because the kids enjoyed the animated characters and squeaky voices when it was on cable. But since then, the film fails to hold their attention and they don't even ask for it anymore. I can't say I blame them. A fun novelty that lacks staying power."
5,Chipmunks are not just for kids,My granddaughter loves Alvin and the Chipmunks so much. She watches the movies and holds the characters in both hands and acts with them in every scene. They seem so lifelike and she loves them. Thank you.
5,adorable :),This one is just adorable Christmas movie :) I love it!! Those munchkins make me laugh every time. I watch it every year and sometimes even twice a year!
4,HILARIOUS!,"This movie is great! It takes the classic Alvin we all love and makes him modern and lovable again! Every time I watch this movie, I laugh until I cry! They way they mixed modern songs into the classic story is great! There are few extras on the DVD, so if that's what you're looking for, you will be a bit disappointed, but other than that this is a great buy!"
3,.Alvin and the Chipmunks.,"I just watched this movie today and it was adorable. The characters were unique and the way that the real world blended with the chipmunks looked nice and not cheap.It's a comedy and brings some laughs too! If you have kids then this is a perfect stocking stuffer or birthday present (if they haven't already seen it).Dave, the father, yells at Alvin almost as much as he does in the old cartoon!! lol...3.6 stars."
4,Fun With The Chipmunks,"I have to say that this movie was very enjoyable for me, partially because I am a kid at heart but also because I am a long time fan of Alvin and the Chipmunks, first being exposed to them by the cartoon, of which I saw many episodes. While your brain may not be overly stimulated by this movie, that may not be a reason to avoid it. It is really a lot of fun, and the chipmunks are so cute. It does seem geared for children primarily, but if you like anything about Alvin and the Chipmunks you should see it. Four stars."
4,for all ages,"I enjoyed watching this film both in the movies and at home with my son of five. Dialogs and humor are not infantile, which makes them fun for the adults, while the kids enjoy watching the chipmunks ""being kids"".Sountrack is great, story is great, animation is great. I's say the lowest point, if tehre is such a thing in this film, are the human actors, overacting a little at times.All in all, I wholeheartedly recommend."
3,"The first 30 minutes is good...then, it went downhill","This has a potential to be a great franchise. They have the perennially popular lovable Chipmunks.The first few minutes are packed with actions, cuteness (specially the chubby Theodore) and fun. My kids were enjoying it. I said to myself ""what were the bad reviewers saying?"" Then it becomes a drag. The story shifted into a complicated cheesy plot about betrayal and evil plans. Some things that my kids does not find interesting and understood well. In short, it started as a good kiddie movie and ended up with an adult theme (which even an adult may find boring).It was actually moving the first time you hear them singing their famous Christmas song. Sort of reminding me of my childhood.I really wish, they have done much better. As a comparison, Garfield movies are at least consistently funnier to the end.I am still recommending buying it. But, I won't be like jumping and shouting, ""pick this, pick this!""."
5,Bev the Great,"For a Christmas time movie, The Chimpmunks rate on top. Lot of comedy, romance and excitement. You can not go wrong with this purchase. This is the movie you will play over and over again. Want a good price, too? Get is from Amazon like I did."
4,Very Cute Movie,This is a very cute movie but whoever I bought this from it was not a very good copy. It stops on and off as it is playing.
5,Great movie,My 3-year old son saw this movie on tv and begged to watch it over and over. He loves the silly humor and singing.
4,The Chipmunks Hit The Big Time,"Many of us grew up watching animated chipmunk programs and now they have hit the big screen. This is a cute show with silly chipmunk antics. Kids will get a kick out of watching recognizable snacks pour out of cupboards as Dave tries to catch them in his kitchen, which ends up in a big mess. Who would have thought it, but Dave's surprise house guests turn out to be the perfect accompaniment to his music writing, which has been pathetic and going nowhere. Life gets a little crazy when the singing trio achieve star status and face some of the challenges that go with it. Dave and the chipmunks bond and have ups and downs like a real family. The movie has a little romance in it too. David Cross (the voice of Remi in Ratatouille) is perfect as the jerk you love to despise."
4,Super funny movie!,"This is very funny! And it has a good lesson. The only things I have a problem with is the misuse of God's name and the immodest dancing and it's kind of sad in a couple parts. But besides that, it was a really funny movie. I would reccomend it to kids. :)"
3,Eh,"There were some funny bits in this film, but honestly, if you grew up liking Alvin and the Chipmunks, you definitely want to stick with the original 80's cartoon, this 'reboot' (why are there so many reboots lately?) is rather disappointing, with a lot of lame jokes in it."
4,NICE TRIBUTE TO THE CHIPMUNKS,"WHAT DID THE NAY SAYERS OF THIS MOVIE EXPECT? BRAHMS??? I THINK THIS MOVIE IS A DELIGHT. IT'S CUTE, HAS SOME FUNNY MOMENTS, AND MOST IMPORTANT, SHOWS RESPECT TO THE ORIGINAL IDEA OF THE CHIPMUNKS. WHAT'S WRONG WITH COMING UP WITH A STORY LINE THAT COULD BE HOW IT ALL BEGAN?? AND A LOT OF PEOPLE LOVE THEIR CHRISTMAS SONG AFTER ALLI WAS ALSO VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE ANIMATION OF THE CHIPMUNKS FOR THIS FILM.NOT ALL FILMS HAVE TO BE DRAMATIC, BE A EMOTIONAL TEAR JERKER, OR HAVE A 'MOTIVATION'.IF YOU LIKE TO JUST RELAX AND ENJOY FOR A CHANGE OF PACE, THIS MOVIE IS FOR YOU. IT'S JUST PLAIN FUN!"
1,Mislead,The cover mislead me to believe that it was a christmas movie of alvin and the chipmunks. My two year old loves them and this turned out to be a movie that he already had.
2,Alvin & the Chipmonks Movie,"Unfortunitly the dvd was lost in the mail, but when we did get it my granddaughter loves it."
1,Never again....,8/5/08 - Item never arrived. I ordered 2 other items from other sellers on the same date of 7/3/08 and received both within 2 weeks. This item was due no later than 7/28/08. I emailed seller on 7/22/08 to confirm shipment as it was guaranteed to be shipped no later than 7/11/08. Seller responded to this email stating it had been shipped. Seller has not responded to my 2nd email of 7/30/08 stating item not delivered. I have taken the matter to Amazon's A-Z guarantee.
3,It has its moments,"The kids liked it a lot, but I thought it was on par with Garfield: The Movie. The songs are a little grating, plus I found myself with the Christmas one stuck in my head all night. The kids, though, really liked it. Lots of laughs and they watched it several days in a row."
4,Alvin strikes again,"This is a funny, family, musical comedy. I have 2 young daughters (under 10) and they thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I have been looking for movies that I can sit and watch with my children, but also allow them to look at on their own, should I not have the time to sit with them each time they want to see it. This is one that I find meets that need."
5,My family loves this movie...,"This movie is soooo cute! My husband & I really enjoyed it & my kids (daughter aged 7 & son aged 5) sat through the whole thing, which says a lot right there. We all laughed out loud so many times. These guys are the cutest. The animation was excellent.I've passed this movie around so other family members could enjoy it, which they did. I think almost any child would love this movie & the parents are suffering watching through a movie thinking they'd rather be doing something else. I think this is a great family movie & I'd highly recommend it."
5,Great Movie! must see for kids!!!,Pinanood ko ang pelikulang ito at ang ganda-ganda bagay na panoorin ng kabataan at may mapupulot pa silang aral. Ang aral na hindi importante ang pera sa mundo kundi ang mga tao sa paligid mo na tumaggap at nagmahal sa iyo. Lalo na ang hindi paggamit ng iba para sa sariling kapakanan lamang. Ito ay numero uno sa puso ko.
4,Great Movie,I purchased this DVD for the kids to watch. They really enjoyed it. My teens also enjoyed it and watched it over and over. This is a good movie for kids and teens!! I enjoyed it also.
3,good,"It was a good show but not as good as it was advertised to be. For young kids, 6-8 It is a good flick."
2,could have been better,"It's difficult to enjoy a movie when one of the main actors doesn't quite ""play the part"". Jason Lee's acting was just awful. This could have been a really good movie."
5,It's fun and interesting movie!!!,This movie was fun and interesting. This movie was nicely done. Also the characters were great. I was laughing the some of fun scenes. This movie was entertaining for the family. It's perfect movie. I enjoyed it.
2,I liked the Cartoon better,"If you have never seen the cartoons, the movie is great. However, being an old guy and having grown up with Alvin, it was lacking. Besides Dave is just pathetic not humorous."
5,awesome,amazon is awesome I got free supersaver with my order and even though it took another 3-4 days it was worth it
2,"I'm Disappointed, this movie could have been much better",Alvin & The Chipmunks had a good beginning but lost its way near the middle. I also think it was a mistake to jazz up the original Christmas song. It could have been much better.
2,Very Disappointed,"I bought this for my 4 year old and was disappointed in the language used by the characters. My own memories of Alvin did not include such words and attitude. (Maybe I date myself here.) The first story was OK. The second one we had to turn off and I had to hide the DVD. Maybe it's not for a 4 year old (or younger) but honestly, I won't be letting them watch it when they are 5 or 6 even. They have a lifetime to learn those words so I don't want them to learn them from Alvin and his brothers now. Why do writers include such???"
2,It was ok,this price was great and got it on time but the video wasn't what i expected. i thought like all the others it was about the actual holiday. It did have some of it but nothing that was exciting.
5,Great moveie,The movie was for my 2 year old son for christmas. He LOVES Alvin and the chipmunks we now have all of them :)
3,Predictable and yet well done.,"The movie's plot is entirely predictable. The acting is ok. The most memorable acting moments are done by the CGI chipmunks, which is a little weird. Seville is ok but he has nothing to work with. Nothing is really done with the love interest. She is there to smooth over some plot points. There are some funny gags and some witty lines. The music is ok. My wife was looking for the subtitles about two minutes into the film. At the start of the movie the chipmunks are really hard to understand, but it gets better.In summary, I recommend this as a good family film, but nothing extraodinary. I would give this movie another 1/2 star for the humor and the music is memorable."
3,Castle is not durable,"The castle is not durable at all, you spend much of play time trying to keep the castle from leaning or falling over. The gingerbread man paint is starting to fade after only 3 weeks. Disappointing and frustrating toy. Not worth the money!!"
1,Junk,This is about the worst toy I have ever purchased. My nephew has gotten much better quality toys in Happymeals.
3,Decent Organizer,This little Guy is really Cute. (The photo doesn't do it any Justice.) However the keys are too small to use anything besides the stylus that came with it. It is great for storing numbers in but you can't use letters below the first line of the display and this makes it difficult to store E-mail and Snail Mail addresses. If you only E-mail and write people and don't call them you would be better off paying a little more for a better organizer. If you just can't seem to keep up with paper then this Little fellow might just be what you need.
4,Shirley Vallentine,"Shirley Valentine has enjoyed screen and stage success as the story of the ignored and unappreciated British housewife who finally has it up to here with her demanding husband and clueless daughter, secretly running off to Mykonos, one of the Greek Isles, for a change of emotional and attitudinal landscape. Once she ditches her self-absorbed female companion on the trip, Shirley settles into an unexpected romance with a cafe owner (Tom Conti) who reminds her just how lonely she's been. Her decision not to return to the U.K. and stay at the hotel cafe to serve guests puts her husband in crisis and a little self-examination of his own as he packs his bags and heads for the Greek Isles to fetch her. Pauline Collins is witty and charming and very funny as Shirley Valentine, especially as she succumbs to the affections and flattery of her younger pursuer."
5,Great story of later day romance,"Shirely Valentine is not just a ""chick flick"". It's a tale of discovery - or perhaps a re-discovery - of one's inner soul. Age does not restrict your avenues of adventure or capture of your youth and awareness of self value. Pauline is exceptional in the role of a middle-aged person who allowed the weight of responsible life choke the spirit of her soul.It truely is a story of redemption and rebirth."
5,Shirley Valentine,"This is my favorite movie of all time. It's very funny with a serious message. I watch it every couple of months to give myself a lift, who needs therapy if you have Shirley Valentine?"
4,Great chick flick,This great old movie is one that all women past the age of 40 can relate to and share together. I watched it with my 87 year old mother and she liked it as much as I did. My good friends recommended it to me and I plan to pass it on to others.
5,Shirley Valentine,"Prompt service, I received the Shirley Valentine DVD within the week. Quality was much better than the video that I had been renting for years. LOL. Would not hesitate to order DVDs through Amazon again."
1,Still have not received,I still have not received this item. I would gladly submit another review after I receive the video. Sorry to have to submit this.
5,Delight to the funny bone and the eyes,"This is a wonderous comedic romp with Pauline Collins as a put-upon British housewife who's just had enough. Her husband barely notices her, her children take her services for granted and the rainy, English climate just gets to be too much.Her salvation is a chance to go on a holiday with a girlfriend to Greece with all its spectacular scenery!She tells her husband she's going, and though he protests (he really doesn't believe her), off she goes to the sun, sand and the azure waters of the Mediterranean! Her vacation winds up being even better than she dreamed and when the time comes, will she go back? Should she go back?Watch and see & be delighted at the lovely ending...or is it a beginning?"
5,Best chick flick-EVER,"I must be honest, I have the movie in VHS version. I wanted the DVD to make sure I will always have a working copy, as I love it and cannot count the times I have watched it. It is not only for women but is a wonderful film version of a stage play. Please give it a try if you are over 40 and need a lift, you will love the actors, theme and characters they play! Very funny and though-provoking."
5,"Delightful, delightful, can't wait to get it on DVD",One of my very favorite movies. It's the kind of movie you can watch over and over again without getting bored. Also saw it on the stage with the magnificent performance of Loretta Swit.
5,Shirley Valentine,I've pre-ordered the DVD and can't wait for it to arrive. The movie is 5 stars. I'm surprised it took this long to come to the US.
5,The Best Movie,A friend got me to watch this movie. It is the best movie I have seen in a long time. I am her. She spoke of me so many times in this move. Any woman with kids and a husband can totally relate to this one. I want it on DVD.. Please put it on a region 1 dvd. I would buy one for All of my friends. It is a must for your collection.
5,Excellent!,This movie is as hilarious as it is sad. For those who like English humor it is a must see.Totally absorbing.
4,Wonderful movie!,I loved this movie but was disappointed it was presented in fullscreen (YUCK!) and not in it's original aspect ratio. For this reason I deducted 1 star. I wish I had known about this movie when the OAR version was available in the US.
5,One of my favorite movies!!!!,"Wonderful for women and men with a good sense of humor. This is a movie that I have watched numerous times and would recommend to all women, particularly more mature women who are in process of reviewing life."
5,Perfect gift,"This was a favorite older movie of my husband's and I am so glad thatI found it on DVD. He was thrilled! It was in perfect condition, shrink wrapped and shipped well."
4,Shirley Valentine,"Very funny delivery of reality. Sometimes we need a good comedy to see life has lost its spontaneity and we need to get back to enjoying the gift of life. Pauline Collins is great. Saw this movie on cable and can't wait to own it. Not just another ""chick flick""."
4,Empty Nesting With Shirley Valentine,I loved this movie as it portrayed so many of the things that I am experiencing at this time in life. Pauline Collins does a great job! The filming was nicely done. I am so glad that this has been re-released!
1,No Return Policy Rip Off Scam,Although it indicates Non USA Format one not familiar with their lingo does not understand that you are unable to view the movie on US machines. The company does not give refunds so unsophisticated customers are out money and time not to mention stress and hassle factor. This gives me little reason to continue to do business with Amazon let alone this skullduggerous third party seller. This company is interested in making money at others expense.
5,A wonderful movie!,"Pauline Collins is absolutely irresistible in the title role, and Shirley is a character who's easy to like. The subject matter could have been handled in a caustic, strident manner (men are jerks, marriage stifles, middle-aged characters, especially women, aren't interesting), but instead, this movie likes its characters, and we grow to care about them too. I should mention that as a 45-year-old housewife I related to Shrley's situation big-time! You go, girl!"
5,great and realistic film,"Great film, and shot in the first person. Shirley Valentine's story reflects the sometimes frustration of housewives who tire of being taken for granted by their husbands and children. However, it also shows how strong and independent Shirley really is and how she finally realizes this and finds herself again. Great film for those ladies who are secretly looking for adventure and want just one more chance and dream about taking it! Funny, quirky and so true at times!"
3,Cannot watch it,"I did not understand that ""non-USA"" format meant that it could not be viewed in the U.S.-please clarify that when listing!Thanks"
2,Non-USA Format - Shirley Valentine,"I was really looking forward to seeing Shirley Valentine again - great acting, BEAUTIFUL SCENERY, and a good story....but the Non-USA format DVD I purchased would not play on my DVD player. So disappointing!"
3,Nice to Return to Mykonos,"Shirley Valentine took me back to a Greek island I liked a lot this summer on a cruise, but beyond that, I wasn't thrilled. While the scenery in Mykonos is a whole lot better than the Liverpool Shirley leaves behind, the movie runs aground once it reaches Greece, just as Shirley's Greek romance tells her the water may be a thousand meters deep when the yacht is clearly anchored all of about ten yards from shore. Ah, well, who needs verisimilitude? It's always great to see Joanna Lumley, in this case before her AbFab days, but Tom Conti plays Costas as a big fat Greek cliche. Pauline Collins as Shirley is funny, especially when talking straight on to the camera or the wall of her drab house. Still, I was ready for Shirley Valentine to be over half an hour before it was."
1,Reduces the screens clarity!,"Unlike another reviewer, i believe that the PDA scrren needs to be protected...I owned another Palm, and the stylus after a while scratched the screen, especially in the grafiti area. So when i got my new M515, i bought these screen proctectors. They are not smooth, but rather a textured surface that on the color screen creates diagonal lines similar to a color Tv with bad reception. The look of the screen is opaque. Also, i find the the grafiti recognition was greatly REDUCED when I applied these protectors. Bottom line. Not worth the [money]. Try the clear ones made by NuShiled and CompanionLink. But do get a screen protector. It will scratch eventually."
5,Does the job,"I've used the fellowes WriteRights on several items, including watches, PDA's, Walkman, and cell phones. I'd definately recommend them if you are prone to banging up the faces on screens. Just make sure your screen is clean before you apply the film. I usually get about 6 months of use out of the PDA before I need to replace. Best to use right after you purchase your item. As for the people that are dissatisfied, I don't get it. I'm happy with them."
2,It's worth it to get the more expensive ones if you have a nice color display.,"I got these for my Nokia 6682 and cut them to fit, because I was balking at how expensive most screen protectors are. Because they are soft films, not hard pieces of plastic like some, they give anything viewed through them a slightly mottled appearance. Also, you can scratch them with a fingernail. If you press down hard when you write, you'll notice that they're a little sticky. But they do go on easily and come off with no residue."
1,You have to take off the protective film and clean it,I read the previous reviewers comments and was amazed. I know people who use the NuShield brand and rave about it. I have seen the film before installation and it does have a protective film on it that has to be removed first. Sounds like the guy was writing on the protective film instead of the screen protector. No wonder he was disappointed. It always helps to read the directions.
1,Very Disappointing!,I have been a die-hard fan of Diana since 1980 and a huge collector of books about her. I couldn't wait for this one to arrive and was shocked to see that not only were many of the pictures repeated but there was virtually NO text. If I had known this I never would have bought it. I did not return it because the proceeds are supposed to go to charity. Don't waste your money on this Book!
5,Beautiful!,Seeing all of these beautiful photos of Diana at this stage in life just leaves me in awe. There is a change to her- you can feel it in every photo. She genuinely seems happy. Her beauty is just magnified that much more with seeing someone on the road to a good place. It is tragic that we lost her soon after these were taken. This book makes me feel like I have a secret family album rather than a book I purchased.
1,Don't waste your $$,"AWFUL! Only a few photos, repeated several times, most were out of focus. Would never have purchased if I could have looked inside. I guess that's why it was wrapped in plastic in a local bookstore."
2,Buy if it is on sale for your coffee table,"I was guess I prefer my photos clear, not slightly blurry. I I also didn't like the ""wet look"" of Diana's hair because I don't think the photos really looked like her. I have some books with recent photos of Princess Diana that I like better."
5,A must have for Diana book collectors,I absolutely love the pictures of Diana in this book. I have been collecting Diana books for years and this is one of my all-time favorites.
2,pale pictures,the book does not inspire the child mainly because of pale pictures. It gives the impretion as though the bppk has been salvaged from flood.

5,cute little sleeping beauty book!,This is a classic little golden book like the many others that we all had as children. Has the little golden spine and beautiful illustrations along with the classic sleeping beauty story. Very reasonably priced too!
2,not good quality,I only bought it because my daughters name is aurora. Wouldn't buy this for any other reason.
5,Great Satire.,"I loved Morrow's Only Begotten Daughter, so I picked up this collection. Now, it's clear to me that Morrow is a gifted writer at any length. If you love satire with a bite, you'll love this book."
3,Lots of pictures,"This book has lots of pictures, is very useful for research, but the patterns are not very useful for a beginner. This would classify in the more advanced seamstress category. I'm glad to have a copy, and the photos are wonderfully inspirational."
2,Not as accurate as you think.,"Janet Arnolds book was something I used to use to make historical reproductions until I had the chance to see a garmet she had chosen to pattern in a museum. There were several blatent mistakes made in the pattern. Apperantly Ms. Arnold does not work from the garment, she works from an artists rendition of the garment, so there are many details that are overlooked. If you want an precise pattern for a historical garment, look elsewhere."
1,What a Joke,"This book doesn't serve much of a purpose other than a paperweight. If you like boring history, this one is for you."
5,A must for any professional costumer of period clothing.,"I liked Ms Arnold's book so well that I received the entire set of her books from my daughter. As a professional costumer I found the construction of the choosen garments in her book more for the experienced sewer rather than a beginner. There are construction notes to help, but they are very difficult to understand if you have limited sewing experience. Also, notes dealing with the finer details on each pattern such as embroidery, edging, and fabrics are given for those of use who are looking for recreating each garment as worn. I might add that each pattern is on a grid to make it easier to enlarge for any size. Pictures of each piece, plus a painting, if possible, is all so part of this informative series of books."
4,A must-have for anyone interested in 16th Century costume,"This book would have to be described as ""the bible"" of late 16th century costuming. It is a goldmine for anyone interested in the actual creation of garments of the period.I would not be without my copy; I actually own two, so I can lend one out without having to be without it.The only flaws are that it is incomplete, lacking much of the undergarments of the period, and that there are a few mistakes in some of the patterning, which can have interesting results... certainly make a toile of the garments first, but generally this book is a gem.Note: this book assumes that the prospective sewer has quite an advanced skill in sewing; if you can't sew without instructions, you might find it challenging, and you need to expand the patterns up from the scaled down illustrations"
5,"If you love 16th Century costume, this book is a must!!!","This book is by the world's foremost researcher of costume and it shows! The attention to detail, history and patterns are invaluable. Although Ms. Arnold has recently passed, this series of costume books are truly a legacy of her greatness. NOT FOR A BEGINNER. Imperative for the advanced costumer who wishes for authentically reproduced garments. The patterns are taken directly from the garments themselves. Her bibliography is exhaustive. Her historical notes, awe-inspiring. I would be lost without this book. (I am on my second copy.) Amazon's price is excellent. In some circles it is much, much more. -- Tonessa West Crowe"
5,"Patterns of Fashion: The Cut and Construction of Clothes for Men and Women, C.1560-1620",EXCELLENT!!!!!! Great research tool for SCA. LARP and Renaissance historical projects. Gives wonderful pattern layouts to those who understand and can re-create patterns.
5,Awesome book!,"I used this book to design a pattern for a Doublet that I wore to a Mayflower Society function - it was a big hit. I added my own ideas to it. One of the members said it was the best they had ever seen.This book shows pictures of original clothing, then drawings of the patterns of the originals. Wonderful!"
1,What a piece of Junk!!,"I bought one of these phones (supposedly refurbished by the manufacturer) to replace a Southwest Bell phone that we've owned for 10 years. The new phone started having problems within 2 weeks! We could hear our neighbor making calls in the middle of our conversation and then would find that neither we or the party we called could converse from that point on. The only way to end the call was to disconnect the phones power - isn't that great! Yesterday my wife had several calls breakup while she was standing 4 feet away from the phone. Do youself a favor, buy one the other brands out there."
4,"pretty, contemporary teapot","Very nice quality china, strong (not prone to chip), elegant design, creamy white color, one quart capacity. The lid includes an inside ""ridge"" to prevent it from falling away when you tilt the teapot to pour. 4 stars because it drips a little bit - but not a lot. I have used this daily for 1 1/2 years."
5,Amazing Piece of Movie History!,"The poster just looks incredible. I'm a huge Creepshow fan and am a writer and this work of art will grace my office in a beautiful frame. It's printed on high-quality photo/poster paper, the colors are vivid, and I can't find a single flaw in the design work. Perfect for any Creepshow fan!!"
3,Dritz Molded Foarm Bra Cups Review,"The B/C cup is true to size and the shape is natural and smooth. The cup's shape is substantial, appropriate for use under clothing that has ample fabric coverage. Skimpier constructions like bathing suits will need the teardrop shape cups, which are smaller and offer push-up. These foam cups offer coverage but no push-up, so buy accordingly."
3,Highly Effective Cards,"I actually purchased these cards in error, thinking that they were the book.When I received it, I was disappointed.When I read them, I was delighted!!!!They encourage great focus and act as a boosters at the start of the day - pick up a card, read the back also or just read the front in the extremely pleasant font, and make yourself more effective and generally a better person.A lot of these points made are quite obviously (although some are a lot more subtle and extremely cleverly presented) but fundamentally, it helps to make you a balanced and better person, which then obviously spills into your personal and business life.They are the closest thing you will get to a quick fix - where a book requires you to be motivated to focus to read it, these are available at all times - pick one up from your desk before a meeting, browse through one or two while on hold for a phone call - you can only benefit if these ideals and tips sink into your subconscious!"
3,Meh.,"I guess it's an above-average psytrance album, but it just didn't do it for me. I should point out that I came to this album hoping it would deliver music similar to Shpongle, and while there are some similarities this is more along the lines of formulaic dance music: aggressive, repetitive, and, well, rather dumber than Shpongle.Bottom line: it's good for what it is (a dance album), but don't expect another ""Are You Shpongled?"" or ""Tales of the Inexpressible."""
3,Navy Klogs,"I like color, but these are different than the chestnut ones I own. They are flimsy, the support is not as good. They run true to size, just not as comfortable as the chestnut. Suppose to be the same shoe just different color, but its not the same."
2,Barely functional,"I bought this several months ago at a box store to take the pills off my knits. It's almost ineffective, even going over the area multiple times, very slowly. I tried multiple angles, different pressures, and just can't find a way to make it do much of anything. It was pretty pricey, compared to other battery-operated fabric shavers, and I wish I'd have saved my money."
3,Fair Lint Shaver,I would rate this product as fair. It removes pills from fabric but the lint reservoir is loose and you must hold or tape it in place to prevent it from falling off which is annoying. I purchased this model to replace one which had quit working but I probably would not purchase this one again.
3,windmere clothes shaver,"it's ok. not up to the quality of the original. the fuzz collection chamber won't stay in place(keeps sliding out). the shaver blades are flimsy and had burrs(rough metal chips) on the edges. luckily, i still had my old shaver head(was almost brand new) and it fit the new shaver. have to use a piece of tape to keep the fuzz collection chamber from sliding out of place. unfortunately, i won't replace this one when the motor mechanism dies. too bad. i loved the original windmere clothes shaver."
1,Animax Dub Not Here!,"The one notable thing about this DVD is the uncut/unedited DVD version of the series.However, Animax DUBBED the series a while back. There is no English Dub on these DVDsnot even the ""edited version"" that's also present on the DVD which was dubbed.Bandai didn't even need to go find actors themselves. They just had to use a Pre-existingaudio created by Animax Asia and their job would've been done.(Still looking for a copy of the Animax Dub -Purchasable not just lingering on the internet in choppy audio)"
1,Do Not buy! Bandai is ripping you off big time!!!!!!,"Ok Hayate The Combat Butler is a High Quality Anime that is worthy of being released in a fair fashion for the fans. Bandai is trying to walk all over people with this. Calling this DVD release Part 1 with 7 episodes is insulting, and with the biggest problem being no English dub track, they have over priced and ruined a an awesome series.. People that was looking forward to Hayate the combat butler I am sorry that you and I won't get to see the Anime the way it was suppose to be seen. I watched Hayate already Subtitled only but when a Anime is released on DVD it should not be subbed only unless its a really low Quality and that is defiantly NOT the case with Hayate The Combat Butler.... Bandai should be ashamed!"
2,"entry-level textbook disguised as ""tips""","I don't know why this book is rated so highly. There's nothing wrong with the content (what little there is), but I feel that it's misrepresented as a book for intermediate level network programmers. I was expecting discussion on when to use select() vs. multi-threaded vs. single-threaded servers, for example. But this book is more for beginners (Tip #1, ""Understand the difference between connectionless and connection-oriented protocols"").I also feel that the title is misleading. I was expecting a book of specific tips on par with Scott Meyers' Effective C++/STL series which are vastly superior references on their own topics).It's decent as a textbook, once you realize that's what this is. But it's still pretty shallow, and definitely not worth the high price tag."
4,The gold standard on formatting scripts,Great reference for any aspiring screenwriter. This is the gold standard for formatting your script. Recommended by professional screenwriters and instructors!
2,E-book is a no-go,"Fantastic book, but the e-book version of this is not worth it if you're really trying to see how to format a screenplay. Get the soft cover physical version instead.Other than the faults of the e-book version, The Hollywood Standard (I have a physical copy of the first edition) is one of the best resources for a screenwriter out there, though it could have been more clear about the differences between production scripts and spec scripts.Two stars, and that's just for the general content, which is so minimally useful in this reference guide that I don't think the e-book should be offered. At least, not in this format. I'd rather see the original PDF of the printed copy."
5,A Must Read,"If you are even thinking of writing a script, you need to get this book. It is well organized and well written. Don't go to work without it."
2,This is for Shooting Scripts,"If you're writing a spec script, beware this book misses a LOT of important differences. The title and first page are different for spec scripts, you don't put all NOISES in caps, your transitions are limited to 2 or 3 per script, and so forth. I recommend David Trottier's ""Bible"" and ""Dr. Format"" to get you straight on all the rules you need to know about spec scripts. Save this book for after you are well grounded in all the spec script rules."
5,A Must for Anyone Entering the Entertainment Industry,"Our scriptwriting group uses this as a textbook. Excellent examples of formatting, style and how-to's. I'd also recommend for anyone interested in joining a production crew (shout-out to all those laid-off by the Big Three). Takes the mystery out of the industry by explaining WHY."
3,"Good, but misleading for uncomissioned writers","This book is full of authoritative information for screenplay formatting - however there is one major problem. The author makes no real distinction between what is required for spec scripts and scripts already in production.The majority of the book lists the correct way to format shots (wide shots, close ups etc) but these should not be included in spec scripts. A great deal of the information provided is aimed at production script format. Ideally, the book should have been divided into two sections, but unfortunately the organization of the book will likely lead novice writers to include unnecessary direction information and thus format their scripts incorrectly - a great (and surprising) shame for such an otherwise useful book."
4,The format bible,"John August put me onto this book. He said it pretty much covered every question he gets asked about screenwriting format issues. And he's right.Even if you've already written enough screenplays to think you have format down, I guarantee you'll find this a handy reference. It's precise, concise and easy to understand. A good book to have on your desk."
4,Not Recommended for First Time Script Writers,"This book is very informative, however if you are a first time script writer like me, the book can seem contradictory compared to other screen writing books. I also own ""The Screenwriters Bible"", and it is an excellent book for writing your first spec script. As I continue to progress in my screenwriting, then this book would probably be more helpful, but for now it will remain on my bookshelf until later."
5,Beckett at his best,"Beckett gives you a lot in a few lines. His shorter plays are the work of a genius. Poignant as usual and more concise than ever he gives you a lot to think about. I LOVE Not I, Come and Go and many others. The line ""f*** life"" in Rockaby stands for a lot, really: pity us poor human beings! We ARE doomed."
5,I like it!,Anything that comes from Minnie City is cool...check this one out....You will find some Madhouse music on it...
3,Prince +,"I stumbled across this one by mistake, thinking it was a full-fledged Prince album. He's on here, but so are a million others. The only really good track here is the opening song ""Minneapolis"", with an excellent beat. Otherwise a throwaway."
1,this thing sucks,"ok, got this gun for christmas, brand new out of the box right? take it out put it together, charge it, load the mags. go outside to shoot it, bb's go like 20 feet AT MOST and then a few just roll out at the end. the gun was definitely firing you can hear it, but the bb's just have something against the world and refuse to come out at all. the gun sucks don't bother."
1,This gun sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!,This gun was soooooooo bad. I wanted to play with it the first day I got it. Guess what. The clip broke. I got a new clip ( for 10 bucks) and then The scope had no crosshairs and didn't magnify at all. Please don't buy this gun. it is a colossal waste of money.
1,Absolutely terrible,"I got this gun and I immediately charged it for the recommended charge time (6-8 hrs) and i was super excited. As soon as I unplugged it and put the battery in the gun (fully charged) the gun shot no further than 30 ft.Having spent nearly $60 when you include the shipping and handling, needless to say I was upset. Now i have to send it back, which will cost me about $40 to ship it back and i don't think amazon is gonna pay for it.Trust me, keep looking and find a nicer gun."
3,O.K. Gun,"This gun is okay , the only things wrong with it are:its scope is uselessthe mag runs out to fastBut the good thing is is that it is fun to shoot."
3,Alright.,"This gun is alright. I personally only purchase high grade AEGs such as Classic Army and Tokyo Marui. However, my friend has one of these. As I said, this gun is alright. Just alright. I personally do not like how semi is a half trigger pull, and full is a full pull. The gun is 300 FPS. With a .12g bb. My classic army is 320 FPS with a .20g. That isnt comparable though, because this gun is a fraction of the price. If you are planning on using this for sniping, it won't work. The scope is zero magnification, and the gun doesn't have the neccesary range for sniping anyways."
1,Don't listen to the rest of them,All the people above must be lying or i got ripped off. I get my gun load up the mag like it says put the mag in correctly pull the trigger and nothing happens. i Hold the trigger down for full auto and out of those thirty bb's only 2 came out and they practicslly rolled out. I kept trying and trying. I took the gun apart and couldnt find any problems. The maker sent me another mag. to see if that was the problem but it wasnt. The barrel is messed up because the bb's from the mag. dont reach highenough for the bb's to enter the barrel. Even with no bb's the rpm is probly like30-50 rpm. Really slow and terrible fps. what a waste of money dont buy it.
3,"Average gun, good for beginners","I purchased this gun about a month ago, and I have to say I am a little disappointed. The scope on this gun has no crosshair and has no magnification. Also, for this gun to be effective, you are almost certainly going to have to buy a high capacity magazine for it. The gun's firing rate is very high. The 30 round magazine that comes with it will be drained in about 3 seconds of continuous firing. The biggest problems I found with it is that the fore grip and the safety are very flimsy. The fore grip is loose even when you try tightening the screws on it, and the safety isn't actually held into the gun. It will occasionally fall out of the gun if you push on it a little too hard."
3,Caution,"A couple of issues with this product, The one I got didn't work. I had to send it back and the selector switch had to be change (which is the triggerby the way.) The instruction don't tell you much of anything important likehow long to charge the battery. Power is just like it says (300 fps.)Nicely weighted down to feel real. The scope is junk, use the iron sight.In short, for the price it's a fun gun, not for battles.mgso"
2,"good gun,if it worked","This is an amazing gun for its price, but the quality is terrible. The bb's will roll out instead of shoot out. i have had this gun for 2 wks. now and it worked only one time when i used it. it now does not work and am shipping it back for a refund.i recomend any m4 or m16 style airsoft guns."
1,Stay Away From This One!,"Used it twice and it will no longer fire, it seems to be working but just makes noise!?Gun won't feed bb's and I have extra magazine so it's not that.The barrel comes off so I know it's not clogged.??I contacted AirSplat and they were more than helpful on replacing it with a different model. So much that It seems they may have had earlier complaints, but thats just my feeling. Great reseller - bad product."
1,WHAT U SEE ISNT WHAT YOU GET,"THIS AD DEPICTS AN [...] GUN ON AIRSPLAT, NOT THE CHEAP PLASTIC GUN THAT COMES INSTEAD."
2,"great value, really powerful, not so durable","to start this is a great gun , but not at all durable.pros:powerfulcool lookingcons:fake scope includedregular sight broke in the first five minuteshandle was flimsy, then broke off in the first daysafety broke after i pulled the trigger oncethe clip it came with was brokenthat may sound like alot of bad , but its all minor details. when you get down to it those things dont really matter"
1,AirSplat Customer Service is Terrible,"I purchased a Sniper Rifle AUG Styer Air Gun Powerful 300 FPS from Airsplat and had problems with it the day it was delivered. I contacted/emailed Airsplat several times requesting information on how to have it returned being it was within Airsplat's 30day warranty period and was given the runaround. One delay after another. Ultimately, Airsplat wanted me to pay again the shipping and handling charge to return it to them! How could a customer be held responsible to pay to ship it back if already paying to have the defective product shipped initially! After inquiring about this with Airsplat - They just ignored my question!In any event, AMAZON was nice enough to honor their A-Z guarantee and handle the situation properly and courteously. I thank you Amazon!"
1,"Crap, Crap Crap",Gun looks cool but mine sucked. Never worked right. Would fire a few good then the rest about 10 feet and jammed constant. Battery was fully charged and it sounded like it was working right but wasn't. I returned it and after a long wait finally got my money back. If you order this your gambling on getting a good gun. Good luck
1,HORRIBLE GUN,"This gun only shoots about every 5th BB, and when you first start shooting, it takes about half way down the clip to finally shoot. Sure, it shoots hard when it works, but whats the sense in that if the gun doesn't even work! Don't get this gun, it would be a terrible investment on your part. Try the M82, I have that one as well and it is a very solid beginning level assault rifle for airsoft."
4,freakinawesome,"Ok, so i was looking through another website and found this gun and thought, hey, it looks pretty cool and its electric!(a plus) So i shoped around for the best price and bought it. IT IS AWESOME!!! It shoots really hard! (now all my friends want to be on my team in order to avoid being shot about 20 times) Mine has never had a problem and i've had it for about 3 months now.Pros:-shoots hard-works great-can be semi or full automatic-looks cool-easy to loadcons:-dont overcharge the battery or it wont hold a charge very well-it really hurts when you accidently shoot yourself in the hand to see if it's loaded-the safety switch takes time to get used toOverall, this gun is great!! The magazine only holds 40 rds, but if you use them wisely, they'll last a while. Dont shoot yourself in the hand because it really hurts and most of all, take time to, during a match, hold down the trigger while aiming at someone to unload on them.(it helps relieve stress)~~A MUST BUY!!!~~"
5,This gun is awsome!!!!!!!!,This gun is sweet. it really shoots around 325 and it has really good range.I shot my friend from 60 - 70 feet away and it left a huge bruse the size of 4 quarters. The speed loader it comes with is really handy in wars. it comes with- the gun - goggles- .12 BB's - gun sight- battery & charger- cleaning rod- speed loader- owners manuel- scope
1,sniper rifle,"I orderd this gun to give my son for his birtday after christmas in January. He was so excited to open it. I read the directions and charged the gun fully. When I tried to test the gun,unlock the safety to shoot, the safety was broken and fell out of the gun completely and the trigger would not do anything. Needless to say my, 9 year old was very upset, because he had been patiently waiting and been wanting an airsoft gun like this for some time.The process to return the gun is concerning and I had to pay shipping again to return a non working gun at no fault of my own,now awaiting a new gun which I hope is of better quality. I was not impressed with this quality, but was not given many options on the return. I am concerned the next gun will not be very good quality and if not already broken could break easily and will be a waist of my money. Sincererly, Kelley McLeod 678-575-2601"
1,This gun sucks,I was really excited when I ordered this gun. It seemed pretty cool. So it finally arrives and I open it up. I put everything into place and load it up with a charged battery and a full clip. I fire it once and nothing happens. I try charging the battery again. Still nothing. The trigger was really hard to pull so I tried taking the front off the gun and seeing what was wrong. I couldn't find anything out of place. But it still wasn't working. I wouldn't buy this gun if your looking for something good. Go with Double Eagle or UTG if your looking for something in a low price range.
4,Excellent Valaam Institute,"The Valaam Institute choir in excellent form. The Tsarist National anthem performance is too refined. The arrangement unfortunately is spare rather than primal, the power of the basses not arriving until the end cadence, although effectively used there. The famous Valaam intonation on magnificent display from beginning to end. Both 'Oh, mighty Tsar!' and 'God, love the Tsar!' are captured with brimming musicianship and both are excellent anthems. The men sing the folk melodies with partiality, and it works beautifully. Great CD, but repeat I missed a bit of something in the singing of 'God, save the Tsar!' - it wants for more reverence, less civility."
3,Did not fit,"It says compatible with AM2 socket, however how much I tried it would not fit onto my motherboard. I have no idea how well this product works because I was never able to test it."
5,So far the best single Paul Mauriat CD available @Amazon,"Yes, there are too many Paul Mauriat CDs to choose from, and many of them have overlap in track selections. But, if you only want to own a single Paul Mauriat CD, this is it. Almost every track here is among the best from Paul Mauriat: Love Is Blue, Penelope, El Bimbo, Nocturne, Toccata, Song for Anna, La Reine de Saba, Minuetto, Last Summer Day, Pearl Fishers, etc. Plus, some of those beautiful music pieces (such as Last Summer Day) are not found in many other Paul Mauriat CDs currently available.In fact, this CD is among my top three of all the easy listening instrumental music albums that I have ever listened to."
2,terrible clarity,"To me, the most important feature of a cordless phone is it's clarity.This phone sounds terrible. Static, echo, just plain cheap sounding. I don't know what else to say. Other than that, it's a great phone. I mean, it looks like a phone.My house mate has a Uniden model (discontinued 900 Mhz analogue) and I have been searching for it's equal since. That phone is a dream. Honestly, It sounds better than even any hard wired phone I've been on. When I am on a call, If there is a brief moment of non-conversation, I sometimes think the call has been disconnected because there is absolutely no background noise. I find myself blowing into the mouthpeice to see if I am still powered! It is that good. i think i will buy a modern Uniden and hope it is as good."
4,"Excellent articles, wrong cover","I got sent an issue with the wrong cover - Pitt is on it, Tutu not. Other than that the magazine is very interesting and has a lot of informing articles on Africa in it."
3,Synopsis: From the back of the book,"Benchmarking has been used for years by manufacturing and service companies to identify and learn the best ways to execute various practices. The Guide to Benchmarking in Healthcare explains how the benchmarking process can be used by healthcare organizations to improve their processes and services.The first section provides detailed look at the four phases and twelve steps of a benchmarking project. It serves as a quick reference guide with checklists highlighting the actions taken during each step. In the second section, four case studies illustrate benchmarking projects from different perspectives within healthcare organizations. They include views from the implementation team, the project sponsor, the executive committee, and other members of the organization not directly involved in the project. Additional chapters examine the use of Internet in benchmarking and the benchmarking of healthcare costs."
1,I want my money back,"This ranks right up there as the biggest disappointment since the Tori Amos album Strange Little Girls. I'm a huge Pretenders fan, always have been and I own them all but this.....I want my money back. Not a memorable tune in sight. Remember Pretender albums with 5, 6, 7 hits on them? Tunes you want to hear over and over? Well, this doesn't have a one and it's an all too familiar experience I've been having lately...."
4,"Kinda Nice, I Like It","Seldom do you hear an artist admit their faults, but Chrissie Hynde boldly puts any masks or defenses aside to get to her issues on ""Loose Screw"". What's more, Hynde and band decided to go with a slight reggae feel to this cd. This choice has an interesting effect of offsetting the sometimes brutally honest lyrics. What sums up this cd is a light and airy feel with cynical and sometimes sarcastic looks at relationships and love. I don't know how many failed relationships Ms. Hynde has had, but to document her most recent failure is a testament to her courage to self-analysis in the public eye. Instead of going to therapy, Ms. Hynde goes into the recording studio. Key tracks: ""Lie To Me"", ""Complex Person"", ""Fools Must Die"", ""Kinda Nice, I Like It"", ""I Should Of"" and ""Clean Up Woman""."
4,Something to think about,Although the author states that he didn't write this as satire it would be easy to guess that perhaps he did intend for it to be ironic. Whatever the case it was certainly a wonderful story!
2,Silly nonsense,Started reading this book and at first it seemed good. But the longer I read it just got silly and dumb. Your kids might like it but adults should stay away.
4,"""Quality Classics"" Kindle Edition","First, this is an excellent book. It is more than worth the $.99 I paid for it.The ""Quality Classics"" ebook edition actually has illustrations, I was surprised to discover. However, they are fairly low-quality scans that are lacking in any decent amount of contrast.Also, this is the text from the Gutenburg Project version, which is not a complaint by any means.If would like to see the poorly scanned illustrations (by Charles Robinson), pay the dollar. If not, download it for free from the Gutenburg Project.Either way, you will have found an excellent book."
1,Once on a Time,I disagree with the author that this was his 'best' book. I would far rather enjoy the humour of Christopher Robin and his friends!
2,Not for anyone with basic Word or Excel knowledge.,"Unfortunately, anyone with a basic knowledge of how to use Word or Excel or PowerPoint or equivalent programs on a computer could easily create these materials. It's basically like a ""Creating documents for dummy's"" book. I was excited hoping it would give me more ideas than I already have/know how to do on Word or Excel or PowerPoint but it did not. I wouldn't spend the money on this unless you have NO idea how to use Word or Excel or PowerPoint."
2,frustrating,"I agree, the patterns are beautiful. But I am used to cross stitch charts - trying to follow a knitting chart is totally different - and confusing!You also have to keep going back and forth between the chart and the symbol explanations in the front of the book. Not my idea of a fun knitting evening!"
2,Disappointed,Some nice stitches but all in charts only. Most stitch guides give charts and text instructions and I find it poor form to give only charts. This is useless to me.
2,Lots of Patterns,but if you don't know who to read charted knitting be prepared to learn. Very few written directions and have to constantly go back and forth trying to figure out the charts. Definately would not recommend to a new knitter.
2,Lacking in varity,Stanfield is no Walker. This book does offer many attractive designs but the variety was lacking. She seems taken with cables and lace. Many of the designs obviously stemmed from the same ideas. I found the charts hard to follow and was frustrated in my attempts to reproduce her designs. Give me the classic Treasury of Knitting Books over this anyday.
2,Hard for a Beginner,"There were a variety of stitches, however, the charts, were often confusing. A beginning knitter would have a very hard time working with the graphs and trying to get the same results. It would of been much easier to read and understand with the old K2, P2 etc . My suggestion, find a book with the patterns completely written out for you. Less confusion and much more fun."
5,No Better Wax!,"I've been using Zymol (Carbon) for years. 13 years actually on my 99 Escort ZX2. i've won multiple car shows with this car. now i'm using Titanium on my 2012 Focus. best looking 3rd gen Focus in RI. maybe even New England. no wax finish lasts longer than this stuff. i'll wax my car in early November, go through the winter, & it will STILL be beading in April. i don't know any other wax that will last that long. it's worth the money."
2,DIVA'S THOUGHTS,i WAS ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR A SPECIFIC MEANING FOR A SPECIFIC NAME. i WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE HAD THE OPPOURTUNITY TO RESEARCH WHEATER OR NOT MY SON'S NAME IS EVEN INCLUDED IN THE BOOK.
5,Straight Talk from the Expert,"A terrific overview of the sometimes complex concepts surrounding a change in leadership or ownership of design firms. Lays out the options for a couple of different ways to transfer ownership/leadership and includes case studies that show how different options have been carried out. It's a solid book that talks directly to architects, interior designers and landscape architects. Recommended for anyone being considered for a future leadership role in a firm - and definitely for anyone or any firm getting ready for a transfer of ownership or leadership."
3,ONLY BIKE OF ITS TYPE AVAILABLE,MY 5 YEAR OLD SON INSISTED ON A BIKE WITH HAND BRAKES FOR HIS 5TH BIRTHDAY. THE PROBLEM WAS THAT HE ONLY FITS ON A 12 INCH BIKE. THIS WAS THE ONLY BIKE IN THE MARKETPLACE EXCEPT ONE THAT LOOKS LIKE A MOTORCYCLE THAT HAD A HAND BRAKE SO I PURCHASED IT ONLINE. THE BIKE ITSELF IS OK. IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO PUT TOGETHER. I WAS JUST HAPPY TO FUFILL HIS BIRTHDAY WISH BUT IF YOUR CHILD IS NOT SET ON A HAND BRAKE THERE ARE MANY OTHER BIKES THAT ARE MUCH NICER TO PURCHASE THAN THIS ONE.
4,Beautiful but online info did not tell length,Love the wallborder. Online info did not mention how long the roll was. One roll covered 28 ft of wall space. Had to order 2nd. FYI.
4,I have extra!!!,"I absolutely love this wall border. We painted our walls lemonade yellow, and put this border above a chair rail. It looks amazing. It was fairly easy, but messy to apply this border. I have quite a large chunk of extra border. I bought two rolls and only used maybe a quarter of the second roll. I can measure if anyone is interested in it that needs extra. You can email me at uphamj@cccomm.net"
4,Border Instructions,"I love the design on the border, it's going to go really well in our nursery. Can anyone tell me exactly what the instructions said that came with the border, we accidently threw them away. Thanks."
1,Length of Roll,Can anyone who has recently purchased the wallborder provide the lenght of the roll? Unfortunately the manufacturer description does not provide this information. Thanks.
1,Great music inaccessable,Love the music--live is much better than the earlier album--however--it cannot be downloaded into an MP3 player. that means I will never be able to listen to it. I think the small mindedness of this technical limitation will keep Mariza from being a global star---don't buy this CD. it is a crime
5,The great music of Portugal.,"To people who loves good music and the history of Portugal and its culture. Mariza is one of the most incredible singers of this kind of music, a great pleasure to hear, with a good wine, if possible!"
3,The DVD is worth the price of admission,"I'm a fado traditionalist; this art form is best enjoyed in small intimate settings, accompanied by Portuguese and Spanish guitars. The live concert CD is OK, but it's big, orchestral fado, and not what I was expecting.However, the documentary on the accompanying DVD is spellbinding. It's a wonderful history of fado, punctuated with performances by Mariza and others, mostly in small, intimate taverna settings.If I could split my rating for this product, I would give the CD 2 stars, and the DVD 5 stars."
1,"Fabulous music, live recording sucks","Mariza has a great voice and her music is just fabulous. This recording is mediocre at best with people shouting from the audience and clapping with the music. It feels as if you are in some yankee-doodle get together. In some instances, they have dancers on stage and you can hear their feet and people cheering for them. It feels as if you are listening to the Nashville Grand Ole Opry Dancers on Radio. Pretty awful. I guess you'd have to be at the concert in order to enjoy this CD. Otherwise skip it. To have audience participation rob you of the purity of Fado is something that I don't appreciate.I bought this CD after I saw Mariza on David Letterman and she was simply fabulous. Fado is to be enjoyed for its purity of sound, beauty and sadness. Also shame on Mariza's publicists for promoting this CD on Letterman when they should be promoting a non-live (and non-hick) version."
3,First Zane Grey I ever read! Very good!,"Never wanted to pick up a Zane Grey because I thought his stuff was so male-oriented. But his portrayal of his ancestors piqued my interest, especially since the hero was female. I took the tale with a grain of salt, realizing how even family stories can grow into legend. I was moved, however, to investigate some of the historical persons mentioned in the book, such as Lewis Wetzel, on the internet. What a fascinating time to read about. So MAYBE I'll read another Zane Grey book. We'll see."
3,Betty Zane,Good book about early settlementsnin in the Ohio Valley. Just make sure you read The Last Trail by Zane Gray. Betty Zane is a continuation.
4,First time ever reading a Zane novel...,...and I really enjoyed it. The chapters were all very long but it was nicely done in the way where he gives us a change of scenery and place where we can take a break if we wanted to. I had no idea what I was going into when I started but the characters were very believable as with the story itself of the first settlers near the Ohio. Great book!
4,Addictive,"Like a good Pavement or Radiohead album, this one grows and grows on you with repeated listening.The Phoenix Foundation hail from Wellington, New Zealand and as such are unlikely to get much in the way of international exposure.I strongly recommend this CD and their more recent release: 'Pegasus'. Excellent and intelligent arrangements, clever lyrics and melodies. Alternative prog-rock fro this century."
5,Spanish Baroque masterpieces,"Angel Flores was an anthologist some fifty years ago, and this was one of his more interesting collections. It consists of a couple of picaresque novels and a trio of plays. For those readers who wish to explore beyond Cervantes, but who don't know Spanish, this is the ticket."
1,utterly boring and bland,"When I started reading this book for school, I thought I had already read some really banal books, but this has to top them all. It is so eeriely similar to the Awakening that I found myself subconciously comparing them at every possible chance. Emma's actions are so close to Edna's that the two women seem like they should have been born sisters. The way that they treat their husbands and the responses they receive are almost indentical. What I find so irksome is the way that Emma refuses to see through her thick mind the consequences of her actions. Unlike Edna, Emma completely ruins her child's life along with her husband's. This tale seemed like the exemplary tale of a woman's scandelous attempts to find love from page 100 and Flaubert manages to drag the story on for 300 more pages. There should be no pity for the ""heroine"" Emma, only a wish that she should have received her true comeuppance."
3,Good writing,"I enjoyed this in spite of the fact that I don't like irony and there's not a single character in it I could identify with or even liked. But it was tightly written, I guess I enjoyed it for that. And the story was somewhat compelling, even though Emma Bovary was a mess and so was everyone else."
3,Apparently not the preferred translation,Bought this for bookclub and a member who is a literature professor had another translation she preferred. Sorry-- Can't remember which translation that was. I did love the book!
3,"Entertaining, but hard to follow","Madame Bovary(Emma) was about a woman who had a couple of affairs, but the attention of the story was on how the relationship of Monsieur Bovary(Charles)and his wife progressed. The aspect I found most intriguing was that Flaubert wrote the book in such a way that when she was with the other men, one couldn't help but think about how Charles is going to feel when/if he finds out. Despite the plot centering around his wife, I felt that he was the protagonist in the story because he had a good heart when after what his wife did to him, on numerous occasions, he shouldn't have had one at all.The storyline is interesting but it ishard to follow since the text is unabridged. Half the book is just a blob of names and places that after a while become blended together and much effort has to be put into remembering the second tier characters. But, overall, it is a good and worthwhile book if you have enough time and patience to decipher the confusing text."
1,Another Vapid& Hysterical Woman Throws Herself Away For Love,"This book was so lame, it took me many years of putting it down and picking it up again to get through it. Why did I waste my time? Because all my cool literary friends just love it and find it sooo very deep. This story is just tired, sexist and overdone. Something about the French writer (of the 18th & 19th centuries) compels him to draw tawdry sexploitative portraits of wealthy women who throw their entire lives away for some hot action. Even Kate Chopin, who is only Cajun, felt the stirring in her blood to write the same idiotic tale in her novel ""The Awakening"" (another book to be avoided like the plague). Most mystifying of all is that many people, even intelligent friends of mine, consider this whiny breach of taste a passionately real and pro-woman statement!"
2,"Most Overrated Classic Ever (including ""Vanity Fair"")","I am not writing this for those who, by their nature, love everything classic. If you start reading ""Madame Bovary"" and, for whatever reason, like it after one hundred pages, then great. I am writing this for all those who get one hundred pages into it and wonder what the big deal is. There is no big deal, and you should quit at this point and not waste any more of your time. The entire book is just as boring as the first one hundred pages. There is nothing-- NOTHING-- worth continuing for: flat stiff characters, no real plot, and stuffy stupid language."
5,A (Readable!) Classic!,"I was required to read this book a little more than ten years ago in my AP English class in highschool but was immediately drawn into the story. I think that one of the most enduringly appealing aspects of this book is not just its imagery and perfectly crafted story but the fact that although Flaubert mocks his subjects (with much wit and humor), he also identifies with them.Much has been made of his comment ""Madame Bovary, c'est moi"", but I think we all have a little Madame Bovary in us, no matter how much contempt we have for her hurtful and selfish actions. Her passionate nature and inability to accept the banality of a middle-class life filled with hypocrites is certainly as current now as it was then. We don't just identify with Madame Bovary, however-I think Flaubert also creates a sympathetic character in the pathetic Charles, who despite his buffoonery is loyal and loving. This is a classic as exciting and well-written as they get!"
5,A Woman's Pain,"A wonderful study on the female condition: her loves, her passions, her fears and her inner, silent sufferings."
4,The best book I've ever hated.,"First off, I have to say that I really, really hated this book. All of the characters were either stupid or corrupt, and Emma's boundless selfishness was astounding. Why four stars, then? The redeeming factor of the book is the way it was written; Flaubert really knew how to write, and the language and style he uses is absolutely beautiful. My advice is to read it, if not for the story, then for the magnificent way it's written."
4,A good classic,"I have not read too many classics so far in my life, but I'll remember this as a one of my favorites. There are some classics that can be hard to read with the old language the writers used even with some modern translations. ""Madame Bovary"" was easy enough to read and I enjoyed it very much so, despite the story not being a happy one.Of course I don't want to give anything away but even though Madame Bovary can be a selfish, twit but in the end you do want her to find happiness. I will soon read a recent author's continuation of the story of Madame Bovary's daughter Berthe in ""Madame Bovary's Daughter"" by Linda Urbach. That seems to be the hot thing for the last five years, that of authors continue the story of classic stories. Jane Austin's is the most popular of course, so I hope a more obscure classic and continuation is just as good."
4,Humanity Captured in Prose,"Like so many of the classics, Madame Bovary does an incredible job of recording humanity. All of the characters are whole, full-fleshed and individual. Emma's discontent with life, her yearning for something more, has probably been experienced by all of us. Her yearning destroys her, and her husband, but teaches us about ourselves along the way. The reason I love this book, and many of the other classics, is that the characters don't always have reasons, they think and behave erratically, sometimes logically, sometimes foolishly, just like real people."
1,hot garbage!,"I had to read this wack siht for class and I must say, overrated garbage! why does everyone think that just cause a novel is pre-1900s its such a CLASSIC. smh. madame bovary lost."
2,Madame Bovary,"The book arrived promply. Unfortunately I did not realise that it was not in english, and cannot read french, The book was old, more than 50 years, when turning the pages they fell out.Next time I order I will check that it is in english"
2,Cheap Plastic Junk!,"Definitely not worth $15.I was surprised as I've always enjoyed Parker pen & pencil sets. Unfortunately, this set was cheap plastic junk. Very thin and flimsy plastic, and the clicking mechanism doesn't work well...sometimes it jams and you have to click again to get it working.Too bad Parker has begun turning out such low quality product."
5,The title doesn't lie,"The AK-47 is not the finest assault rifle ever made. Nor is it the most accurate. Nor is it the most beautiful, although it ma lay claim to being the most brutal looking.It is without a doubt the most recognizable, a symbol worldwide rebellion, communism, gangsterism, and thugishness.Which is of course why I love my AK.But I do not know if most AK owners are devoted readers on the subject of their weapons beyond periodicals. If you are already well familiar with your AK, it's repair, use, maintenance, and tactical use in modern warfare - from set battles to urban combat, then this book will probably bore you. The Schematics are barely useful enough to justify owning it.But if you've ever wondered how to shoot down a plane with your AK, or fire it the proper way while prone, standing, in the open or behind cover, then this book may interest you."
5,Fond Memories,I watched this movie so much as a child. I loved Batman the animated series. I was the perfect age for when the tv series aired and for when this movie was released (born in 89). I was able to enjoy this move as a small child and found myself wanting to watch it again.I bought the dvd and immediately watched it upon delivery. It was better than I remember. This may be the best Batman movie (especially better than any movie before the Nolan series). There is enough action and cool scenes to captivate a child but enough depth it will challenge the child and adult alike.I could not rate this movie any higher.THOUGH. I would love to see special features for this dvd one day.
5,Good Music!,I loved it. It had alot of great melodies and the music is very memorable. I am hoping that more people realize how good this music is even though it came from a cartoon movie.
5,"Very Dark, Great Art Direction","This is a much better movie (to me) than the ""Batman: Return of the Joker"" which is next in the series. Both are great stories (very dark and sadistic) but Mask has a much higher level of animation and art direction than Return of the Joker does. Return of the Joker has that low-budget animation look that at times is distracting, while Mask is so much more polished and beautiful, especially the music score which is dramatic and compelling. I think Mask also shows off the darker twisted sadistic side of the Joker much more so than Return does. If you have an interest in the dark side of Batman, get this movie. If possible, watch it on a good TV with a good sound system."
4,"Animated ""B-picture"" enlivened by good storytelling","This animated ""B-movie"" was originally slated for a direct-to-video release, but had a two-week run in theaters first. Although the animation itself is generally mediocre, the writing and performances are superb.This is the only Batman film -- animated or live-action -- that captures the Dark Knight's square-jawed heroism without venturing into camp or cheap irony. A must-see for Batfans and B-movie lovers alike.Warning to parents: This film earns its PG rating."
4,Very Good,"I thought this movie was very well made, much better than the live-action movies in my opinion. If you like Batman or the animated series, you will love this. However, one remark about the person who said this was the first PG animated movie released theatrically. Sorry, though only one pops into my mind, THE TRANSFORMERS: THE MOVIE (though only one video release has kept its theatrical rating of PG) was rated PG. I do not know if it was the first or not, but that is what it was rated. Robotech the Movie did as well, but I think it was like only released in one theater =) No others stand out in my mind immediately though. Anyway, off the subject there, Batman: MOTP, go buy, watch, enjoy."
4,A worthy addition to the Batman Name,"What can I say? I was pleasantly suprised by how good this film was. It truely is one of the best of the Batman Films. It is actiony, emotional, and shockingly suspensful, you actually care for the cartoon characters! The score is masterfull and the voice talents are excellent. The animation is poor in places, the flashbacks grow tedious after a while and its pretty short. Those are really the only debits. All in All, a great buy."
5,Classic story telling,"I love this batman which covers his orgins and lost love. The writing is crisp, clever, and keeps you guessing until the big reveal. One of the finer Batman movies"
3,Quite good...,"Although being a complete Elfman ripoff, and nothing like the scores for the two original Batman movies, Shirley Walker has created a quite good score for this quite good animated movie. Anyone who loves Elfman's original Batman scores will get quite a kick out of this one. I did."
3,Deep Batman film kinda boring.,"This was a very good film, I would say. It had good emotional context, the animation is still fresh looking, the plot isn't something that you would normally find in a film based on a kids TV show, and the ending was pretty cool.So whats the problem? I felt that many parts dragged on, and that the film, at times, could be rather boring. Some more fight scenes would have helped, I think. That gripe aside, this is a very solid Batman films that many older fans will like and enjoy."
5,Batman Mask of the Phantasm (1993),"This film is probably one of the most underated films ever made. The movie is based off the popular animated T.V. series on Fox, and it has the Dark Knight chasing a new adversary called the Phantasm while fighting his arch nemesis Joker too. Sparks will fly in this action packed movie for the entire family to enjoy. The story still suffers from being predictable though, but it offers some unique plot twists to keep you interested. Overall, I highly recommend this one."
5,Best of Batman.,"I'll keep this review short. This movie is arguably the best Batman movie ever, it has a great story, a nice little twist, and it captures the character of Batman/Bruce Wayne.This is not just a ""cartoon"""
4,Gotham City's savior,"Gotham City's gangsters are being eliminated one by one and the Dark Knight is mistakenly blamed. During Batmans investigation he discovers a new villian, The Phantasm. Also the Caped Crusaders archrival the Joker becomes involved. Amist flashbacks of his lost love from ten years ago he must put together the pieces to solve the mystery and clear his name.Fans of the television series and comic books will eat this movie up. This film reveals many things about Bruce Wayne's past. Along the way we learn the origins of Batmans costume and how it was designed to strike fear into his enemys. The voice overs are all top notch from Kevin Conroy, Dana Delany and Mark Hamill. Batman fans rejoice, the movie you have been waiting for has finally arrived on DVD."
5,Excellent music.,"Shirley Walker truly was a master composer. I've listened to this score many times and it still surprises me. The sound quality is a little iffy (numerous popping sounds due to analog source material, I'm guessing) but it's not at all distracting."
2,not as good as mike farley,"I've seen this guy play twice now at the Odeon, while I was at a couple Mike Farley concerts. I had high hopes for this band, as they are good friends of Farley and work together often (he produced Mike's new CD). Unfortunately, I was slightly let down. Many of thier songs are just watered down rock and roll. They are entertaining, but not very strong. One song did stand out however, and it was unique and surprisingy good. Unfortunately I do not know the name of it, but it was heavy on the harmonica, so listen for it. Tony Lang is worth paying to see if he is opening for Farley, but otherwise, I just can't recommend it that strongly."
4,A bargain among the LED LENSERS,"Also picked this one up at Home Depot on an impulse buy. I was immediately impressed with it's construction, operation and output. It has a nice lens over the LED that produces a very nice, tight pattern. The light is bright white, without any blueish tint.Construction, is first rate. I've always wanted to get a surefire someday but after getting this thing I think I'm gonna look into some of the other LED LENSER offerings as they seem to have greater output than the Surefire units.I'd definitely buy this again."
1,laughably horrible,One of the wirst movies ever made. That should be a simple enough sentence for Segal fans to follow.
4,much violence,"The only good thing about this movie is the aikido moves performed by Steven. Otherwise the movie is kinda uninteresting. Steven produced it himself and tried to give a good message with this film, but the way the movie is, you quickly forget to care anythin about the story.Buy it if you like violent movies with good choregraphed aikido scenes."
1,Nothing Too Spectaular To See Here,"Steven Seagal never seems to learn any acting ability in any of his films and this film is no different. Here he plays a Macho sercurity man for an Oil Company whose substanderd oil drilling is causing trouble for the enviroment and it's inhabitants. The action scenes in this film are awful they all follow the same trend since Seagal's debut in ""Above The Law"" Seagal never gets touched and he can break as many bones as he wants. And with Seagal at the head of the director's duites he has more leway to do whatever he wants. This is a slow dumb uninspied action film with no redemming qualites. Not worth the rental charge."
5,Good action and story,"I love the backgroud of Stevens characters and this one was good. As an action movie this was great. If you want to see truth watch the news. If ou want enterntainment, watch On deadly ground."
4,Steven Segal is Real!!!,"This movie was another movie by Steven that is totally different than all the rest of his movies. I have all of his movies and although some sections may cross the line ""of the impossible"", it is entertainment I find excellent. The thing about Steven Segal and his movies is he is a super high level black belt. Not just ""I have a black belt"", he is totally at the top of the field and also, he knows four languages. The man is brilliant and is sometimes critisized by media as they interview him and he shoots right over their head and they find it rude, but someone that smart is typically a bit eccentric in some form or other.........in my personal opinion, I do not see any bad side of him. I will continue to buy all his movies. Bob"
3,Won't somebody please think of the children / puppies / seals / minotaurs ...,"This movie has a conservation message, namely that eco issues can be made extremely dull if allowed to pollute an action film. This lowers the quality of the flick, as fights are interspersed with a quick talk about how oil slicks damage the wilderness, which surprised me. I thought they were highly beneficial.On the other hand, I haven't caused a single environmental catastrophe since watching this, so maybe it works!Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys"
3,Director Seagal treads on thin ice.,"On Deadly Ground tries to deliver a message about the environment in between the moments that people pay to see Steven Seagal movies for, him busting noses and snapping limbs. But director/star Seagal does not present the message strongly enough, the violent bloodshed drowning out his good intentions. The movie does deliver a great deal of action, though it lays the spiritual mumbo jumbo down a bit thick in the middle. Also the story gives no logical reason for Forrest Taft's violent backlash in the second half of the movie. He is a private citizen, not a government or police agent, so his actions, no matter how 'justified' in the film's philosophy, or nothing more than terrorism. On Deadly Ground is a fairly entertaining action movie, but a complete artistic failure."
3,Not all that bad.,"Before I watched this movie, I expected it to be really bad. But I don't think it was that bad. It was quite entertaining. Some scenes were unnecessary, for example the fight in the bar (but it's always fun to see Mike Starr). It also feels like the moviemakers made a more or less desperate attempt to give the movie some spiritual depth, which only makes it strange. I wish the movie had a better lead actor, Steven Seagal is quite bad, but Michael Caine is good in his part as the evil owner of the Oil Company. The characters are quite simple and Seagal's speech in the end of the movie doesn't really fit in, but as an action movie, I think this movie is totally okay and quite entertaining. If it is on TV and you have nothing else to do, why not watch it?"
1,"Trite, boring action movie","Save yourself a rental fee and pass up this movie. The martial arts are poor to non-existent, and the required bar fight scene is truly hilarious, especially when an overweight and out-of-shape Seagal leaps onto a table to fight one of the bad guys. It is a true miracle of modern carpentry that the small table doesn't collapse from Mr. Seagal's ponderous bodyweight. The ""politics"" behind this movie are simplistic, and hopelessly outdated, with oil company tycoons as the villains and the barely literate Seagal delivering a speech at the end of the movie that, once again, is unintentionally hilarious in its absurdity."
1,The producers should have just burned their money,"Not even multi-academy award winner Michael Caine could save this movie from Steven Seagals acting deficiencies. Who ever heard of the last name Seagal, in reality it was little Stevie Segal getting kicked around everyday on the playground. You can look at him in this movie and tell that he knows the real meaning of a swirlie. The plot, there wasn't one. The action was formulaic. Seagals acting, well it could have been worse, it could have been Van Damme. The movie does, however, answers one question. If you've ever wondered if akido was good exercise, just check out the gut on Seagal."
4,Good movie,"I normally do enjoy many of Steven Seagal's films and this film is a pretty decent one. Some of his earlier films are far better, but this one had some decent fight scenes and good dialogue."
4,Great movie,"Great movie; another Seagal classic with action, drama, and a touch of environmental issues addressed."
1,worst action movie ever,"This is one of the worst action movies ever. Steven Seagal thinks he can save the planet by blowing stuff up. Doesn't that cause pollution? No matter, this movie is hopeless and unintentionally funny at times."
1,What is the essence of man? Ha! Not worth one star.,"Academy Award winner Michael Caine must have really needed a paycheck when he signed on to this rubbish. Steven Seagal (did anyone see his True Hollywood Story...Ha!) stars as an ex-government agent (of course he does) who now works as a firefighter for the world's largest oil rig (I mean toy model/painting). Eventually Seagal's conscience gets to him and he turns on the company and begins to help the Eskimos (ha). ""What is the essence of a man?"" Seagal actually says this in the film right before taking on a factory worker. It's okay to put messages into films and the message this film tries to put out there is a worthy one. However, the message becomes stupid in the context of this ridiculous film. Next to TICKER and THE PATRIOT, this is by far Seagal's worst film and he directed this one and I can't believe I saw this at the theatre because this movie doesn't look like it should have ever made it to the theatres."
3,Environmental Classic,"Steven Seagal is an actor of the highest caliber. On Deadly Ground is a brilliant directorial debut from the infinite talent of Seagal. Two hours of non-stop destruction of the environment to kill the baddies, and in the end he blows the mind of his audience with a speech on how we must save the environment. Steven flawlessly reinvents the action film genre. If you really like this one, see Fire Down Below. I can only hope that he will someday finish the environmental trilogy. The oeuvre of Steven Seagal will never be complete without a third evironmental epic. Go Steven!"
5,on deadly ground,"another one of steven seagal's great movies, i like his take on taking care of the earth. and we should try hard to do so"
1,Wrong output listed on Amazon,"This amp head is listed here on Amazon as 575 watts, which is not true.This amp puts out 180 watts RMS!For shame!"
3,The views of someone who had written in the book.,"Having borrowed this book from the library, I discovered on the fly-leaf a bet of text written in pencil by a previous borrower -- or owner. Here it is: ""This book is a magnificent dose of common-sense -- which the world badly needs. Doctors (as a class) are probably the only true, sane people in the world. The book is a Tristram Shandy."" It was signed by F Hanes"
1,"Overrated, Out of Date and Amateurish","This discursive, rambling instance of poor scholarship is a blight. Little justifies this book's continued presence in print. It is anti-semitic, racist, bigoted and, in many respects, anti-intellectual. The science is out of date, and was conservative in some respects even at the time. His expeditions into other arenas display his amateur status and naivete, which masquerades as snobbishness and is, at the end of the day, merely stupid. I'm sure, for those who cannot be troubled to read better books on the many topics it covers, it serves some enlightening purpose. I'd rather it didn't. I am unutterably appalled."
2,Missing morals,"Love Aesop and his fables, but many stories are missing the moral at the end. Did not find mention of this on any of the reviews here. Do I have a bad copy or has anyone else noticed this?"
3,Illustrations?,"Great stories as expected, but the title includes ""A Classic Illustrated Edition"". Don't expect illustrations with each story."
4,Good but short,"I love the short stories in Aesop's Fables. They're great for light reading, but I find the length of the book a little bit too short for my liking. However since the book is free it's worth getting."
1,Aesop's Fables: A Classic Illustrated Edition (Classic Illustrated),I was disappointed that the stories hadn't been re-written in today's language. I wanted to read it to a young child and the language detracts from her understanding the messages.
3,pictures in book,"to tell you the truth i was disappointed because the book is not fit for a three year old. I expected full page coloured pictures and simpler language. my niece, for whom i bought the book, was very disappointed too though she likes books and stories, but the stuff did not interest her at all."
1,My disapointing review!,I love them but I relized I did not have enough to read and I got something for nothing and I was disapointed!
2,Overly Didactic,I was not at all impressed by this collection. The variety of fables were either too opaque to discern any moral or too translucent that the explicitly stated moral became redundant and unoriginal.
4,Aesop's Fables,The fables are inspiring when you stop to think about the logic behind them. They are just as current even in todays values.
2,Historical read.,"I read this book first off because it was free for my kindle and also because its a classic with deep thoughts and lessons to be learned. I'll be honest - it was like a college assignment I hated to do. I read one or two of the short stories a night and the book took me a good year to finish just because I don't like the older writing style and its a boring one to try to keep awake at night. There are good lessons and though provoking stories, however not a single one I can quote today since it wasn't that memorable for me. At least I can say I read it, right :)"
5,Old Aesop looks new again,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JML3K0/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_imgThis translation contains many fables that I have never seen in any other edition, and I have been reading for 62 years. I'm very pleased with it, and highly recommend it to anybody who enjoys folklore and fables. Children can enjoy it, but so can adults."
1,"Book is different from what ""Look Inside"" shows","I purchased the paperback edition. It is completely different from what is shown by the ""Look Inside"" feature. The item I received is not a properly published book. It is a scan followed by OCR, with no pagination, punctuation errors, text in wrong place etc. It is totally unusable. It is not even a proper book! I am surprised that Amazon is even selling this piece of junk. My copy is going back to Amazon."
4,"Very Nice, but there are better pop ups out there","I like this book, but having more than 100 pop up books in my collection, I have to admit that it's not one of my favorites. It's a little bit hard to use, and kind of fragile. But it's impressive nonetheless."
5,Aesop's Fables,"Buy it. If you have navigated to this particular edition, you are smart enough to own it. Do not worry about the children. Actually, when the Amazon parcel arrives, elbow the children to another room. This is far too good to have them screaming in your ear with delight. There is something about Aesop which rings a bell in children and melts an adult to complete admiration. And, the engineering skills of Kees Moerbeek along with the perfect illustrations of Chris Beatrice and Bruce Whatley make one want to petition Simon and Schuster for an Aesop team II.Bear in mind that the Metropolitan Musum carries this edition for their children's list, and they seem to know something about art.I gave it five stars because six were not offered."
5,The Best!!!!,I love the life lessons in here!! Highlight them and show your kids!! They learn viable lessons about life! !
5,Classic moral teachings,"While I knew several Aesop's Fables from childhood, I knew nothing about Aesop himself. This book provides background about Aesop, in addition to having his fables in one volume along with beautiful drawings depicting characters in each fable. This book was a Christmas gift to two middle schools girls whom I mentor. They are considered ""at risk"" to not finishing high school. I thought this book might provide some guidance to decisions they'll make on their journey."
4,I loved the original,"These stories are a little bit intense for some, but others they are great. I greatly enjoy this read. And its free."
3,DON'T be confused!,"The paperback edition of ""Aesop's Fables"" should NOT be confused with the Hardcover edition of the same name, that other reviews on this page refer to. While I think the illustrations are quite lovely and the fables familiar, I (probably through no one's fault but my own), did not get what I expected. There are only 13 fables, some of which are little more than a few lines long, and there is no additional commentary or context. The price is reasonable for what it is, but this is not a soft cover edition of the hard cover of the same name!"
4,Make Sure You Are Ready for This Version,"Beware - This book is intended for mature readers. What I am referring to, is the style and vocabulary used in which the fables are told in the book. When I bought the book, I had intended to use it as a bed-time story book for my 7 and 5 year-olds. I found myself having to paraphrase quite a bit because it was written with a lot of subtlety and words that are not oft used in today's language. Also, the book is very loyal to the classical rendition of Aesop's fables, and the morals can be quite dark and unforgiving. For someone who appreciates good literature and tastefully paired art work, it is a good read. I would recommend this book for older kids to be read on their own."
5,Worth the Wait!,I ordered this book months ago and I finally received it this week. It was worth the wait. Beautiful pop-ups. One large pop-up and at least two smaller pop-ups per page each depicting scenes from some of the more widely known Aesop's Fables. I actually was surprised that each page was so full and so wonderfully crafted. If you are a fan or collector of pop-up books this is one of the better ones to get.
4,Great stories,I love that these are classics are available for Kindle free on Amazon. That is primarily why I bought the kindle for my son--to give him a fun new way to get all of the timeless classics. Thanks Amazon
3,Why is Amazon's database so lame sometimes?,"What a bummer. I want to order this book, but can't because Amazon has linked up two separate editions under one product ID number, and mixed up the reviews as well. They do this a lot: ""Three Billy Goats Gruff"" is another good example. I was hoping to buy the version illustrated by Lisbeth Zwerger (that's the search I did that got me to this listing) but now I find they've mixed that book up with multiple other ""Aesop's Fables."" If I can't reliably know that what I'm ordering is what I want, then the product listing does not deserve high marks. And nobody wins - not me, not the artists, not the publishers and definitely not Amazon. No sale for me. :-("
2,At least it's free!,"Translated and meaning lost in a few of these, with no explanation for the strange fables.Looking for the real thing I read as a yute."
4,Snippets of Wisdom,"Very accessible stories that will remind you of your parents' advice and/or a Biblical proverb! This book is not only a productive way to pass the time, but also an interesting way to examine your opinions and attitudes about a variety of subjects."
3,The classics,Quick read. There is a lot of redundancies and the general message often conflicts with previous. Overall good to go to the source.
3,Beware™,Some of these reviews are for other editions of Aesop fables! these fables in this book is horrible. it is only one page long. half of them arent even made by aesop! do not get this book!™Copyright Bored Reader
3,RE: Missing Morals,"Mine had missing morals as well, but didn't mind. I thought the morals that were given were too obvious... plus they took away the thinking element!For instance, with the Spendthrift and the Swallow, the moral was, effectively, ""one doesn't make a rule"", but there was another moral there that I almost overlooked: ""don't just trust those around you, judge for yourself before making a descision."" This is especially ironic because that describes the situation of putting morals there in the first place!There are TONS more morals than the ones given... don't trust them!"
2,"It's a Classic, but definitely not suitable for small children.","This book is a well-known children's Classic -- to be sure, but in reality in spite of using simple phraseology and grammar, and teaching life lessons, this book is the Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas of fable books. Seems on every fable someone dies or is killed or commit suicide. And while I'm not a ""protection bubble"" parent at all, these are not fables you want to read to your child unless they're 12-13 years old."
2,Aesop,"Classic! Fast read good lessons. However, there were some punctuation and spelling errors. It is funny though how many of the aphorisms at the end of each fable are sayings we take for granted, and remarkable that they are still in use."
4,TIMELESS,It doesn't matter how long ago these fables were written; there are still lessons that can be learned by everyone today.
3,Short but Important,"I never actually thought about how fables composed by a person that lived over 3000 years ago could survive today. There is no clear overall message to the fables. They were collected and composed by different authors over a few millenia. An important reason to read this collection, if any, is to come to know where a lot of the proverbs in the western world come from."
4,Good Collection of Fables,"I bought this for my 9 y-o niece. I was able to go through the stories before I sent it to her. There is a great collection of the fables, and all the popular ones I can recall are included. The language is subtle in some cases which may evade a young child. The stories are great for evoking discussions between parent and child. Overall a good book."
5,Great Imaginations!,"As a researcher myself, I always feel that I lack the imaginations. Thus I always wonder why other people have such a great imagination. In this case, I wonder how the author(s) thought out to use animals to express his (their) morals.But some morals are not in my favors, for example, Better servitude with safety than freedom with danger, in The Fox Who Served A Lion."
2,incorrect aphorisms,"This version ""...a new translation"" contains aphorisms that are at best misleading and at worst the wrong moral lesson. Not what I remember their purpose. For example ""The Lion and the Wild Ass"" tells of their partnership in capturing prey but when time came to divide it, the Lion takes it all. The aphorism then says, ""Might makes right."" Might can be misused for greed and disreputable contract but not to make it right! Additionally there are no pictures with Kindle versions."
5,5 STARS!,Arrived fast and the book is in very good condition. I'm going to enjoy holding on to it and reading it to my daughter. Thank you so much!!!
3,A good book,"Aasop,s Fables was a good book, even though it was written in old English. It is a true classic and a good classic."
3,Interesting,"I had heard a number of Aesop's fables in the past but this was interesting and most of them made sense in my mind. Good, short read"
3,Aesop's Fables,"Tales with moral endings. Preparing those for the hard world. Each story has some familiar stories like Sheep in Wolf's Clothing, and The Boy Who Cried Wolf. (Those are not the actual titles of the stories in the book) There are quite a few I did not know of like The Dolphin and The Lion which is the one that sticks with me the most.The stories are never more than two pages long and while I got the moral of some others seemed over my head or maybe too old. I did not find much entertainment in reading this which is probably how the tales should be read not for entertainment but as stories read to warn us of dark side of life."
5,Excellent Replacement Keyboard,"Almost thought the webtv would be thrown over the fence after contacting Sony and ascertaining that Sony no longer has replacement keyboards. This unit is actually better than the original; a bit larger and with convenient thumb indentations for ease in holding the keyboard. Price was actually less than the previous board purchased through Sears. Alas, the purchase of a Dell shall have to wait."
3,"The Long Ranger, Vol 3","The episodes are duplicateS of those episodes on THE LONE RANGER, THE LEGEND BEGINS and/or THE LONE RANGER, VOL 1"
5,The Lone Ranger and Tonto,"Return to yesteryear with this excellent DVD. An excellent digital recreation of the original series. There are 2 movies. The first is actually the first two series joined together and in B&W. The second is one of the later series and is in COLOR. Note in the B&W version, Lone Ranger has only one standard revolver ! It's crisp, sound transfer is terrific. Get it ! I also learned what ""Kemo Sabe"" means for the first time ! It's ...... no, find out for yourself by getting this wonderful DVD ! HI YO SILVER, AWAY !"
4,The Original Lone Ranger.,The Legend of the Lone Ranger is in black and white and I think it was produced for TV programmed. Till now nobody could replace the late Clayton Moore as the Lone Ranger.
5,still waiting,"I ordered the CD on 12/28/00 and have still not received it. I am not writing this to complain but just to make the buyers aware that it must take a while to get an Import CD in. My hopes have been high since I placed my order and I didn't want other Crowes fans to be at all dissapointed. I heard the song ""Peace Anyway"" one time in October of 2000 and the song is still in my head. I'm looking forward to the album and have already rated it with 5 stars. Harris #3 3/12/01"
4,At least one track now available,"For those people that have been waiting for this import to arrive. The wait is about to be over for at least one track: Peace Anyway. It is one of many ""out-takes"" included on The Lost Crowes: the Tall sessions and The Band sessions.I was lucky enought to pick up a copy before the recall and have enjoyed it for a month now, before the second ""official release"" on 09/26/2006.Lots of great ""new"" tracks to digest. Highly Recommended."
1,It will take a while to get by your side.,"I ordered this on Jan. 14, it is April now and I still don't have it. But I'm gonna try again cause I havn't seen it anywhere else."
5,Bigger,"I though the truck would be matchbox size, the scale was much bigger and more satisfing to my collection. Awesome!"
4,Elegant LCD Desk Clock,This is a very good product. The only thing is every time you push a button it makes this loud sound and you can never turn that down or off. I like that is tells you the temperature in Fahrenheit and in Celsius.
4,Goldilocks and the Three Martians,"Goldilocks and the Three Martians by Stu Smith and illustrated by Michael Garland has wonderful, bold and colorful pictures that really stand out and grab the readers's attention. The rhyming pattern used throughout the story is very smooth and makes for an easy read. The author has done an excellent job re-telling the original Goldilocks and the Three Bears but has spiced it up with a little more of a twist! This is a great book to read with children and it shows them that things may not always be as bad as what they seem, everything is just right!"
5,Great fun for the whole family!,"I have several of these poetry magnet kits. Some are meant for adults, while others are geared toward kids. I have used them in the classroom with great success. Kids who normally wouldn't write poetry find manipulating the words into a poem much more fun. I have older versions of the Original Edition, The Artist Edtion, as well as the Kid's Kit.The Magnetic Poetry Book of Poetry, has the magnets PLUS sample poems, poetic terminology and poetic formats, such as haiku or cinquain.Another company, Illuminations, makes a kit called Poetry Word Play, which comes in a case that looks like a CD. The more magnets the better when you are trying to be creative! Great product!"
2,Magnetic Poetry Kit,"I purchased this product for my elementary-age granddaughter and was disappointed that the product does not reflect the age level of the recipient. Some words were too adult, and I removed them. (""Sex,"" for example; ""Gender"" I would have kept, but ""gender"" didn't appear). The product description made it seem as though this poetry kit was designed for a young person, not an adult. I would not buy this as a gift again."
5,Great Police Trooper,"Got this car for my Kid after his first Shake-n-Go Taxi Cab, which turned in an instant PREFERRED TOY. Expectations were high on this Police version, and to our relief, they were met.The Police version for this amazing series features police sounds and the racing style makes it look great.Highly recommended."
3,Disappointed . . . NOT original songs conducted by Percy Faith,"The samples on Amazon are not taken from this album, but from Percy Faith's original work. Therefore, I was really disappointed when I received this album. Although these are supposedly arrangements (I say this because I think some instrumental arrangements were altered a little) of Percy Faith, they are conducted by Nick Perito, who was not able to express the passion of the master conductor himself. When I listened to half of this album, I constantly found myself disappointed by the consistent lack of expression in each of the songs. I have a couple other original Percy Faith albums (Tara's Theme, Greatest Hits & Christmas Is) and I grew up with listening to many of his albums at home, so I am very familiar with Percy Faith's original work. If you're familiar with and truly appreciated Percy Faith's original work (and I mean his conducting the orchestra himself), you may well be disappointed in this album, too."
5,Execlente interpretación de la música de PF,"Este disco, totalmente digital, con la orquesta de PF pero dirigida por Nick Perito, respeta los arreglos hechos por PF con música de diferentes épocas, es uno de los mejores! Me encantan el sonido y los arreglos. Es uno de mis preferidos. También ha habido otros, con musica latina y temas de peliculas.Se los recomiendo, vale la pena tenerlo en la colección."
5,a walk down memory lane,I love this cd... it brought back so many memories from my youth. Freguently I fall asleep to it at night. Very relaxing.
3,Could Have Been Better,There are so many great jazz tunes so why are the musical choices on this cd so bland? Maybe my taste is changing.
5,Saved me $20,"I purchased this book at the ASU bookstore for $110+, ordered it used and got the same book, nearly perfect quality for much less. This makes me happy."
2,Statistics for the Behavioral,The book contains few torn pages and the outside cover is slightly torn on the binding.
1,missing data,This book was okay. My main problem with the electronic edition is that its missing valuable charts that are necessary for class participation. What good is a textbook if I can't even use it! I'm thoroughly disappointed.
3,Great book - way too expensive,"This book was really useful, but I would have gotten it anyway since it was required for a course. I did find it useful, but it is amazing how expensive textbooks are. I found the best deal here, but still feel ripped off."
1,Can anyone fix the Typo's?,"The book has some great examples and are easy to understand. My only problem is the typographical errors. They are way too numerous for the cost of the book. Somebody fire the editors and/or proofreaders that let these get by. They have taken a subject that many people are phobic about and struggle with and have made it more confusing by the mistakes that are in the book. Two errors in one problem... Somebody help me please! Professors, please pick a different book or at least read through the one you are selecting to make sure the editing was actually done!"
5,super fast!,"I am so happy with my book! It came to my doorstep lickety split, and it is in great condition! For the price I paid, there are no markings, writings, or dog ears on it at all. I cant believe it! Thanks a bunch!"
4,College book for daughter.,"Delivered quickly and much cheaper than college book store. This was teacher's edition, which has answers the student edition does not."
5,Very Fast and Great description!,"Bought the iteam with expedited shipping on tuesday and received it on Friday the same week. Description of book was accurate, would recommend this seller."
1,Book Sucks,The book doesn't explain concepts clearly. It jumps around alot. Quite a few wrong answers to problems. You will need a tutor or an additional textbook to get through this. One of the worst text books I have ever used.
1,why did the kindle version disappear???,what happened to the kindle version?? I had it on my wish list and was going to make the purchase. Now it is not available on kindle. What happened?
1,awful,do not buy this book on kindle its took hard to use when a paperback book would have been much easier to use
4,Comprehensive Stats,This textbook was the recommended text of two that we were required to buy for a doctoral level Stats course. I think that speaks for itself. It's definitely not just a basic Stats text. Worth buying if you want something comprehensive.
3,"Good product, bad handling","We purchased two of these, different themes, at the same time. The first one was fantastic. Easy to assemble, all pieces there, just as we expected. Then I opened this one and, after discovering a piece was broken off of it, spent the next 20 minutes searching for a part in my garage and fixing the broken piece. The screws they use for a couple parts did not seem quite long enough. So I had to locate a screw that was a bit longer to fix the problem. Everything seems to be fine now, except the paint seems to be unfinished in parts (Noah looks a bit like a white blob, no outlining definition). I'm glad we opened the other one first and had a positive experience to balance this neutral one."
1,all over the place,"lots of material. kind of a mess. not at all efficient or easy to use. the index is irritating, just one big long list, jumping around alot in themes and content. i spend more time trying to find material in the book then if i had done the work myself. it reads like class notes, which is not necessarily a negative, but the content is basic for the mental/social health practitioner. you'll get more substance by typing in the topic you're seeking information on in a good sw/psy/medicine journal search engine. it's customary for alumni to have internet access to the electronic journals of one's graduate school library. a simple search would bring much more substantial material and take a lot less time."
2,Guide For a Layman,This is more a guide for the lay person and less for those who are expereinced in the helping profession. I did not find this guide useful at all.
2,DISORGANIZED!!!,Could not have been more disappointed with this text. I was in search of how to write treatment plans and thought I'd found the ideal book. Ugh! The content might be sufficient but I have NEVER seen a book more disorganized and without direction. I still don't have a real grasp as to how it's laid out. Very frustrating~
3,Somewhat Disappointed!,"This book was not as helpful as I thought it would be. It does not do what the title suggests. 1-2-3s of Treatment Planning suggests that it explains how to do treatment plans. At least, that is what I thought. It does not explain how to do treatment plans. It just has a lot of information, somewhat irrelevant for me."
2,Poorly Designed Product,"I bought 3 of these to monitor my invalid mom and they don't work well. The manual is not thorough, but it does tell you AFTER you bought the product that there is a one-second delay unless you buy an AC adapter. I just bought 12 batteries for 3 units and wasn't about to buy an AC adapter to see IF that fixed it. It cut off my mom's voice and I rarely heard her message. The units also have annoying beeps that can't be turned off. No real volume control either. A very overpriced and poorly designed unit. Also, the switches to adjust for conference and vox mode are small and need a small object smaller than a pen to change them. The sound is clear if it doesn't cut you off, but the units are far from user-friendly."
4,A Good Product,"This intercom system worked great right out of the box. Easy to use. Most surprising was how small the units are. I was not eager to have a big black unit on our kitchen island. I was very pleased when I saw their small size. I would definitely recommend them.By the way, the transmission issue is overcome if you simply instruct your family to press and hold the talk button until after the beep is finished before they start talking. If you simply wait a half second there is no dropped transmission. My 7 year old got the hang of it in 2 minutes."
3,good intercom / bad monitor,"The good:- intercom is easy to setup- very clear (as long as you do not stand too close)the bad:- the beeping that occurs before anything is said is loud and annoying- the monitor option does not work well w/ the batteries; and even with the plugin, it did not pick up certain frequencies (like a high pitched baby)"
3,great concept,"these intercom are a great concept. i gave 3 stars because the sounds quality through the speaker left alot to be desired. the range was excellent though. it would be nice if they had an analog volume control instead of only 3 volume settings. however, they have the best range of any true wireless intercom system i have came across"
5,easy as pie,"I bought this intercom because my husband is recovering from an accident and confined to one floor of the house, and we needed to communicate between upstairs and downstairs. It's the best intercom I've used: very clear, even with my hearing aids. There's no interference at all with other WiFi in the house. The instructions are not well formulated, but we followed the directions given by ""Z. Pham 'kids and gadgets'"" (see review below)and it worked within seconds!This product has my unqualified praise."
5,outstanding beyond belief,"two upstairs and two down stairs. when you inicialy call someone on one of my four, the remaining three sound the words. whichever one of the three is used to reply back, cancels out the other remaining ones so they are not disruptive to others who might be in the rooms where the two not being used are located. You can also set one or more of these up to be voice activated so it could be used as a baby monitor or elderly person monitor. GREAT BUY"
4,A Wireless Communication tool that is great for seniors!,"We had purchased a Reporter RWIS Chamberlain doorbell/intercom system for my 78 year-old mother whom had a hard time getting up to answer the door. Now, she's able to talk to the person outside, ask them to hold on and wait until she can get to the door. This has been great with neighbors whom check in every once in a while as well. I added the additional 2 intercoms for other parts of the house when my sister and I come visit and she can get hold of us by just pressing a button - no more yelling needed! I highly recommend getting this sytem -- especially for the price -- it's a worthwhile investment."
1,Intercom review,My pole barn is 100 ft. from the house and has metal siding. The only way the intercom would work was if the overhead door was open. That isn't acceptable in Minnesota winters. I even tried using 120 volt adapters. No luck!
1,Worthless as a room monitor,"Regardless of the channel you use, the two units routinely lose their connection. It's never for more than a few seconds, and would not normally be a problem. The problem is that the unit ""peeps"" every time it reconnects!!! Simply the stupidest design feature I have encountered in many a year. Obviously, you won't be using this in a room where you are trying to sleep while keeping an ear open to a remote location."
5,Very good product,"I purchased this item, as well at two additional units, for my house and am very satisfied with them. I have two units in the lower level and two upstairs and they all work very well. You may have some interferance if the units are too close to other electrical components, but you don't have to move them very far away to eliminate it. For example, the unit next to my computer was also very close to my computer light. I only had to move it a couple of feet away from the lamp and all interference stopped. The two units with the most distance separation are about 100 feet apart and on separate levels of the house with plenty of walls and flooring between them. They still work perfectly well with each other. Overall this has been a good purchase decision."
2,Great -- if you are in the same room,"I purchased a pair of these to communicate between our house and my mother-in-law's house which sits behind ours. Her house is no more than 75 feet from our back window, so I figured there would be no problem. WRONG. Only by standing at our back window and placing her unit in her front room could we even remotely begin to communicate -- and this was spotty at best. Forget using it through walls and other barriers! I had to set it to all 4 channels scanning in order to pick up a clear signal, the rest of it cuts in and out.I then moved it to my garage, much closer to the rest of the house. Even now it's iffy at best. If I still had the packaging I'd return it -- now I can only warn others not to purchase this. Great sometimes, but way too touchy to rely on it."
2,Adequate System,"I bought this intercom set to monitor our pregnant goats. ""Monitor"" function is good; range of use is great (over 300 ft from house to barn, through solid walls and metal roof). Battery only use lasts a very long time. Hate the ""beep"", I would rather just start hearing the goat's ""BAHHH"". Very little actual volume control--it's loud, louder and loudest and not very easy to figure out how to set. It will be a good intercom for just calling from barn to the house but a regular baby monitor would be better for my purposes if I could find one that is truly wireless like this."
4,Wireless battery intercom that works!,The Reporter RWIS Wireless Portable Intercom System works as represented. It saves shouting and steps to reach someone in another part of the house. It replaced an FM wireless that was always picking up noises from lamps and appliances. The battery power allows the unit to be moved around.
4,Wireless intercom works well,"This 2-piece set works very well throughout the house. We bought it so that while I'm in my craft room and my husband is in the office, we can communicate if we're in the midst of something."
3,OK but not what I thought,"I have returned the product because it did not meet my needs. I thought VOX would let me talk without being too far from the unit, to transmit my voice. When I first phoned Chamberlain the rep said I was working it correctly so return it because it must be defective. The replacement was no better but when I phoned, a different rep told me that VOX had to be initiated each time by pressing the Talk button. I got a refund."
1,Did not work,"I have ordered this unit twice this past month, the first one did not work properly in one of the units, the signal was distorted. After returning it to the supplier, I ordered it again from another Amazon supplier and one of the units did not work at all. I will now look for another brand."
1,Garbage....,I purchased several of these on separate occasions and they all just stop working after a while with no damage done to any of the units. This may be the worst product I have ever purchased and as a business owner I do not recommend you wasting your money on these.
2,REPORTER WIRE FREE INTERCOM SYSTEM,"A few months ago, I purchased 6 units for emergency communication in our home because my wife was just recovering from open heart surgery and I needed to be in constant touch with her no matter where I was in our house.PROBLEMS :1.- Hard to understand incoming speech. It is somewhat distorted and muffled.2.- I had a hard time making them all work together.3.- Called Company for instructions only to be told they no longer make my model and do not offer advice. Also, will no longer repair this model nor replace defective units or parts.Now, I am in the process of looking for another brand that works properly and will always be able to have it repaired."
4,Shop communications,"We purchased the Reporter wireless intercom to communicate between our home and an adjacent shop building. This was an excellent choice for us, as it works from any room in our house to the shop. Our only issue is the overdriven sound levels, even with the volume turned down."
3,Muffled muddy sound,I can barely understand the sound from this intercom. It is very basey and muddy. Also my barn is only about 100' from the house and I have to put it in the window for it to work... I am not impressed...
4,Wish I had thought of this sooner,We are forever screaming at each other up or down the stairs. For some reason I never thought about using an intercom system. Works very well.
4,an eye-opener,i was really devastated when reading about the hardships of innocent civilians under the curfew. but then i decided it might be even more unpleasant to be the victim a suicide bombing... so if i could choose i would prefer to be the former.
5,Cutting edge social commentary set to a hip hop beat.,"Straight From the Streets is cutting edge social commentary set to a hip hop beat. Featuring many top hip hop artists ( Ice Cube, Snoop Dogg, Ice T, Kam, etc.) this first film from Keith O'Derek and Robert Corsini takes a hard look at the social and economic conditions in Los Angeles starting with the Rodney King riots up through the Million Man March. This is a film that everyone in America should see."
2,hip hop documentary??!??,"Straight from the streets wasn`t what I expected. If you ask me this isn`t even a documentary about hip hop, more a documentary on black people. On this DVD you have a lot of black people talkin how they shouldn`t fight amongst each other, how they should unite and stuff like that. Besides the interviews with ice t and the low rider show this dvd has nothing to offer. It is NOT A HIP HOP DOCUMENTARY, if you want a hip hop documentary on DVD, buy Rhyme & Reason!"
1,Hip Hop??????,"Not even worth a dime. Don't even bother scrolling down or up. Hit the ""back"" button because this is the worst DVD. I was forced to give one star, it doesn't deserve a star at all. I'd give it a rusty penny.Peace"
4,Ralph Wiggum,"Great looking product, however, it's a gift and I have no idea what the scent is! I am sure the recipient will be pleased because it's hilarious, but it needs a better description from the seller."
5,one of the most moving movies I have ever seen!!!,"When this movie ended, I sat there knowing my perspective on life was changed forever! Jeff Bridges and Rosie Perez compliment each other in an unexpectedly refreshing way. Peter Weir has the ability to show his characters' souls- this is a very deep yet completely followable movie. Be prepared to watch it more than once! excellent!!!!!"
5,Fearless is story of true human emotion,This beautifully well acted and well directed movie is about a man who almost loses his life but never had any fear. Jeff Bridges is spectacular as a man lost to find himself as well conect with his wife and family again.
1,Boycott all Full Screen DVDs,I would love to own this movie on DVD. I think it's one of the better movies I've ever seen. But I refuse to buy any DVD in Full Screen format and I think everyone else should as well. This is *not* the format that the movie was intended to be seen in!
5,"Brilliant film, but not in widescreen on DVD.","I have the widescreen version released on Laserdisc, but why is it not so on DVD? There are no extras on the DVD either. This is too exceptional a film to be ignored this way."
3,MOTIONLESS,"This is the word which comes to mind. Don't get me wrong - I liked ""Fearless"" and I just love Peter Weir. His works are always deep and thoughtful and this one is not an exception. I guess you are familiar with the plot and what I have to say that it's rather slow and... motionless. I understand this kind of story doesn't have to be some other way BUT then it's not a usual type of film you'd rent or buy to kill time on Sunday evening. Food for thought - yes, but be aware of it and don't expect entertainment. If you are aware then you'll like it 'cos it's really meaningful. It has a message that practically all Weir's movies have. But I won't give away anything from the story.So to sum it all up I'd say ""Fearless"" is a deep and serious work of art and like most of them it's a bit dull. But it's not a problem - you may get the message and afflatus. So it's worth while.One minus about the edition - it's fullscreen :("
2,really bad movie,"Not a very good movie. It was almost trying too hard to be meaningful, and the only thing it gave us to convey this deep meaning is the mile-long stare of Jeff Bridges. The movie got progressively more annoying the more I watched. I'm sorry, I really tried to like this movie. It is just BAD. I'll give it two stars simply because the last 5 minutes they FINALLY showed the actual plane crash, so we get some visual stimulation to see and feel what he went through. Maybe if I had been in a plane crash before this movie would have worked better."
1,boring,"Guy almost dies. Now, guy thinks he's invincible. That's just about it. This movie is a yawner, folks. I love Jeff Bridges and think he's a great actor, but you can toss this one in the trash, along with Arlington Road. Of course, it does have a nice low price, if your ego is dependent upon how DVDs you have stacked on the shelf."
3,internet slow,"its difficult to use this online as sometimes it stops, but the movie is great. If I need to see a movie right away and cant wait, I would do it again but preffer to rent it!!!"
4,Extremely Good but DVD is full screen,I am writing this review to tell all buyers of this DVD that it is not in its original format. I do not know why the studio decided to release this masterful film on DVD and not have it widescreen as it was intended. This is not some stupid childrens movie where a pan and scan would not matter but a mature film that movie lovers enjoy. I would buy it if you really want the movie but I think the studio should get a clue and release another version with its original widescreen format. Besides this fatal flaw in the DVD release this film is one of my favorites and one of the best films of the 90's.
1,"PLEASE, THERE MUST BE A SPECIAL EDITION OF IT!","the film is wonderful, for me almost a masterpiece but the dvd edition is full and no extras at all!the studio (Warner) has to make a special edition with audio commentaries by Peter Weir and cast (Jeff Bridges, Rosie Perez) and Rafael Yglesias (writer of the script and the book the film was based); also a extended making of and a special look on the soundtrack by Maurice Jarreand wide format!For Fearless only the best!"
3,Fearless Incomplete,"One of Australian director Peter Weir's finest. His trademarks of inteposing rock and classic sound tracks (Galipoli had Jan Michael Jarre with Albinoni, Year of Living has Strauss' 4 last songs and Vangelis, Truman has Glass and so on) uses Gorecki's 3rd Symphony and U2 to deep emotional effect. Jeff Bridges is at his best and Tom Hulce as the ambulance chasing lawyer is a comic relief but very effective. Benice del Toro, Rosie Perez, Isabella Rosselini, and John Turturro round out a formidable cast. So what's the problem with this movie?They released in pan and scan not widescreen. This is nothing short of a disgrace as this wantonly and indiscrimanently edits fine camera work and direction. So until Warner's releases this on widescreen, this reviewer advises against purchase."
2,"Great Movie, stupid DVD full screen format","I loved Fearless the 1st time I saw it. I bought the video as soon as I could. However, I'm sorely disappointed that the DVD has no widescreen format on it. Without this, I'll have to pass & keep wearing out my tape."
2,Tripe,"As a lover of movies, it pains me to say this about one, but I hated it. I felt like I was being made to feel that I wasn't living life to the fullest because I didn't thoroughly enjoy my last strawberry. The last thing I want is to be made to feel less than someone without being inspired to reach their heights. I thought Jeff Bridges' character was a jerk and Rosie Perez's was an annoyance.There were also many irrelevant subplots: that of the woman he visits after the crash, the role of the psychiatrist and the scheming lawyer and the clingy kid. All detours that could have been productive had the film ever led up to anything with the main story, let alone the sidetrips. Great crash scene, however, very well done to beautiful music and in wonderful luminescence. But the rest, like a strawberry, is hard to swallow."
1,Close to the worst movie I've seen in a long time,"Sorry to disagree with everyone else, I thought though the premise was good, the execution was pretty bad. This is a movie I never care to see again, cause it's a waste of time."
5,"Well worth the money, BUT...","As previously mentioned, this thing is BIG. I don't find the lack of detailing around the engines as bothersome as the winglets and aux. fuel tanks. I'd have rather seen open side windows and miniguns, but only 'cause I'm a grunt and not a CSAR type... Bottom line- higly detailed, and well worth the money. All I need now is the ropes and a squad of Rangers for fast-roping. :-)"
