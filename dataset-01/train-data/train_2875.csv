1,Question,I bought this item but i don't know how to inflate it. Does it need a separate inflator or is it supposed to be built in or with the product? please help me with this.
2,I don't Understand,Why isn't the product shipped? it's been over a week now. I need explanations!!I have been waiting too long enough and no one is telling me anything about it. This is the kind of service I don't like.
1,Poor quality,"Intex downy full airbed, We are really sad about the poor quality that we could never image, the first night we used it, one strip of the air bed pumped up, it wasn't flat any more, it looked like a small mountain and rediculars. Really poor quality, stay away from it."
4,Good price for excellant item,"I found this item to be perfect for camping, extra overnight guests, and to ease bad backs when put on top of my mattress. Very reasonably priced...lowest price I could find anywhere...and so far, has been well worth the money. I use it on a daily basis."
4,Bought as gifts.,My son used his to stay at a friends house last night( New Years Eve). Said it was much better than sleeping on a the friends couch.
3,Doesn't fill up enough?,"I don't know if it's supposed to be this way, or it's just this mattress, but it doesn't seem to fill up enough no matter how much I pump it with air. I've left the pump go for more than an hour and it was ever the same. I checked for leaks and everything, and to be honest if there were leaks it wouldn't have gone from flat to filled. It's just that it wouldn't fill up to somewhat of a fuller extent. If I curled up on it my butt actually would touch the hard floor beneath so you see this is not the comfort you would expect, even from an air mattress."
1,Worthless on third day,"My kids slept on it twice, and it worked well. The third night of our trip, I tried the mattress, but was lying on the ground by midnight. I'm <170 lbs.There is of course no obvious leaking point, so now I can either return it for a partial refund or hand-over-hand the entire thing with bubble spray to try and find the pin-hole link, then hope that it's not on the velvet top so that a patch will stick. What a fun way to end my vacation!"
2,camping bed-too heavey,"The price was right and the size was perfect however the ad that was on the Amazon website never mentioned weight which was key in my needs. I took a chance and purchased this bed and it weighed in at over 8 pounds. It was also not very compact as I would be carrying it in packs on my bike. I sent it back but that was almost a mistake to do that as the cost of shipping it was nearly the price I paid!!! I wish that Amazon had a better description of the product so customers would not have to guess at certain things. No contact information for the product manufacturer either, was listed.In this, I am not a happy customer, although the bed seemed OK - I never took it out of its packing."
4,great product,"It is really good and comfortable, the only complaint is that the bumps on the mattress (it is not flat like a regular mattress) are sometimes uncomfortable. But you can only notice that if you use it regularly. Also, it doesn't come with a pump, that's a bummer!"
1,"didnt last long, unusable after 7 month",Developed a huge bump along the edge- internal row of vinyl beams along one side broke. As the result the mattress developed a huge swelling along the side of it.
1,Very Disappointing Follow-Up to a Promising First Novel,"I truly enjoyed Going Postal. I found it hysterically funny, and a very accurate portrayal of today's twenty-something generation.This newest endeavor is nothing, I repeat NOTHING!! like Postal. Unfortunately. It's not that funny. It's hard to follow. I averaged 1 page a night until I had to put it down for a few weeks to muster up enough energy to actually finish it. (On the up-side, possibly a cure for insomnia!!)I hope Jaramillo's next endeavour is more promising."
2,Thoroughly disappointing...,"I was really excited at the thought of reading this book, I'd been looking for it for a couple of years before I finally snagged a copy. The premise would lead one to think it would be a hilarious book...I was greatly disappointed.There are too many characters (what the (...)was the point of Irene?), the sub-plots are confusing and have little or nothing to do with the main story itself. And worst of all, it's just not funny. Fortunately I only paid $2 for it, I wouldn't pay much more than that."
1,This is the one of the worst examples of coding I've seen,"I just got my copy of the CD today. I was surprised to see that they had stripped off all the code comments provided in the books. All that is left is the terse library of routines with the single character variables we loved to use as a BASIC beginner.Buy this CD for the licence rights, but download the PDF chapters from the NR web site to get the commented code."
4,Great training treat,"I have several dogs, and all of them LOVE these Cardinal treats. Even the new puppy is gah-gah over them. They can easily be broken into smaller pieces if you're training little dogs. They stay soft and chewy even after the bag has been opened. If you train regularly, you'll LOVE that they don't fall to pieces in your pockets. They retain their shape. They have a strong smell, which is great for dogs (not that great for your pockets) but it's not unpleasant. I've tried a few of the flavors. Careful if your dog has allergies. For example: This ""beef"" flavored package has PORK as the main meat ingredient. My dogs can't have chicken, so I read the packaging very carefully.Over all a great product."
2,dog not interested,Tried to use these with my puppy. She sniffed the treat and walked away. Great size for training and convenient if your dog will eat them.
4,Good fragrance - great service,The product arrived before time and was well-packed. Its fragrance is satisfactory and the bottle is attractive. I am very pleased with the service.
1,Hello...,"Hello,To be honest; I am not completely satisfied with the product, unfortunately there is a strong smell to alcohol that modify the real fragance of the product.thanks in advance for best regards.Cajyssi Tachau"
2,Outdoor Imitation Dome Security Camera w/Blinking LED,"I have had a terrible time keeping the LED on this unit working. The first one that I received didn't work out of the box, I returned it and the new one worked for maybe a day."
2,doesn't look real,"the shell itself is made up of plasticky material that looks somewhat frosted, lacks luster and easily scratched by its own package. in my opinion it looks like a $7 imitation dome instead of the 20bucks i spent (times 2). it can only fool an idiot."
4,Sophie,I am very satisfied with Sophie Milman's CD. I had not heard of her before and have been pleased with both her voice and her GREAT musicians.
2,Average,"Average Singer with below average arrangements on often sung standards.I was expecting at least some re-harmonization on these tunes but very muchstraight from the fakebook kind changes. The horn lines were not too exciting.Well....overall, very clean and straight."
3,Doesn't live up to the hype,"An interesting debut effort, but does not live up to the hype. I would suggest that people looking for the next Diana Krall should buy more Diana Krall albums.Maybe next time, Ms. Milman."
5,A scrapbook,"When I purchased this, I did not realize it is a scrapbook for an older child to fill in, which is my fault for not reading the description carefully enough. That said, it would be a great activity to do with a 5+ year old sibling in preparation for the new baby. It was not age appropriate for my 2 year old however."
2,Better without the bible verses,"This is actually a wonderful book for older sibs. However, I purchased it without realizing its religious bent. As I am not a Christian, it was not suitable for our household. I wish the author would publish a similar book, minus the bible verses."
3,For older big brothers,"This book is not appropriate for a big brother younger than six or so. It requires a lot of work and concentration for the reader to ""fill in the empty spaces."" It is more of a ""workbook"" book than a ""reading book."" The child will need adult assistance to ""complete"" this autobiography."
2,Not what I expected,"The book arrived well packed and on time. I wasn't clear at all that it was a) religious and b) a fill in all about the child bookThe description is misleading and should be changed.It was cheap enough not to bother returning it, but I won't be giving it to my nephew.Disappointed."
2,If they could do something about the vocals...,"It is always a pleasure to see a collection of some of the most popular Peruvian negroide songs, but I was interested in hearing Peru Negro's rendition. For those who are not familiar, the group is most famous for their dance performances of the music genre and have achieved international notoriety.But this was such a disappointing experience. The musical arrangement had me tapping my feet from the first couple of notes, that is until the vocals came in. The lead singer's voice (anyone knows her name?) lacked warmth, it had no color, and it was strident! Talk about ear fatigue. I had to stop playing this album soon after the second track started.It was a pity, specially when you compare her voice to other performers like Eva Ayllon, Cecilia Barraza, Susana Baca, or the popular Lucila Campos."
5,LO MEJOR DE LO MEJOR,"El viernes, 10 de Marzo de 2006 en Albany, New York, tuve el gran placer de aplaudir a los ""Embajadores Culturales de Perú."" Entre sus bailes y cantos, una sincera e inminente melancolía corría en mí ser al experimentar tanta belleza, ritmos y unión por un mejor porvenir. Este es un disco que todo Peruano tiene que tener. PERU NEGRO engalana la música negra del PERU. Con sus presentaciones, sus bailes, ritmos majestuoso ejemplar peruano, me enamoré más de mi hermoso Perú... ¡VIVA EL PERU! y ¡VIVA PERU NEGRO!"
2,Flawed,"How could this book on mammals not include an elk? Beautiful presentation of most other mammals otherwise but not include an elk, not like it's a rare mammmal."
5,Just as good as Spanxx,I love these panty hose... they have excellent control and smooth out all the lumps and bumps.. i would recommend these to everyone.. a plus size woman's must have
4,heavy lifting,The assembling is easy (there are good instructions for mechanically chalenged). The ballhopper is sturdy. The wires are thoroughly coated and should last forever. The only complain is - it is heavy.
4,Great Spanglish Euro-Dance Tune,"""Yamboo"" is a group that I am not too familiar with, except that they are a European girlband that produces upbeat Spanglish dance music. AYA BAILA TORERO is a great example of their sound. This particular song is hard to describe. If Aqua or Toy Box went Spanish, this most likely is the type of song that would result. It is happy, bubblegum ear-candy with an internationsl flair. This song is a bit more upbeat and memorable than their previous hit, COME WITH ME, but certainly not anymore superior. I just happen to like this one because of it's pure pop quality. Too bad this kind of music does not make it big in America. With the right DJ, AYA BAILA TORERO could become the club hit of 2000."
5,Great biography of Leslie Groves,"The book is definitive, scholarly, yet dramatic and exciting. Indispensable for understanding how the atomic bomb came about. A necessary counterpoise to the prevailing scientist-based story of the development. Additionally Norris's description (meticulously documented by a vast quantity of letters and interviews) of Grove's childhood and professional years before WWII recreates a lost era when society's leaders and doers were on a higher plane than they are today."
3,Needs Editing,"Good story but often gets bogged down. Wouldn't lose anything by editing out a third of the boring details: Do we really need a list of every class he takes at war college?Finally, the Kindle version is horribly formatted. Very difficult to read because of spaces where they shouldn't be or not where they should be."
3,Heart and Daisy pin,"This brooch is cute, but I thought it would be larger. Too small to see the detailed work."
5,Great Book,"I am a Baltimore Ravens fan but still a Baltimore Colts lover. I just finished reading my grandfather's copy of this and it was the best Baltimore Colts book and possibly the best book that I have ever read. The interviews are great and some entertaining. Every time I had extra time, I read some of this. So, if you are a passionate fan of Baltimore sports, GET THIS BOOK!"
2,"Great words, some pictures not so great","i like the words in this book, but when I showed it to my Sunday School class one little boy, pointing to the pictures on the front cover said, ""Who are those baddies?"". I thought it a pity that many of the saints looked sad and serious."
3,Frustrating but some fun for fans of the show,"I purchased this for my 9-year-old son. He loves the show and was excited to load this on the PC and dive right in. He did enjoy the game but one level was very differet in terms of difficulty and most of that due to poor design and inadequate documentation. The interface is distant third person and resembles a console game shoved into a PC environment.There is a surprising lack of help to be had on the Internet as apparently most fans of the show opted to purchase a console version of the game, leaving little or no public information to help frustrated gamers who happen upon the North Siege level.At any rate, with my help over a couple of days, we figured out the frustrating level and my son finished the final chapter in less than an additional hour.My advice: buy the PS2, Xbox or Gamecube version."
4,Non Fiction,"The famous NFL coach explains how to go about recruiting, building and administering a winning team. It took me a while to be able to get a copy of this from Melbourne Sports Books, as the AFL coaches kept buying them.A master who has built more than one team, and come up with new systems and adaptations of playing styles to suit changing conditions, or to give him, as he says, the Winning Edge."
5,Alternative viewpoint deserving consideration,This book dares to ask why the developing world should agree to economic colonialization via an intellectual property regime they had no part in making. Highly recommended.
3,Product Info,"Per the manufacturer's website, each capsule contains:648 mg Betaine HCL130 mg Pepsin 1:10,000 NFGelatin, cellulose, medium chain triglycerides, vegetable based stearic acid, silicaThey do not specify the source of their ingredients, so those with porcine allergies should probably not use this."
3,Mentions Bhagavad Gita on Numerous Occasions,"Contrary to what another reviewer wrote, the book mentions the Bhagavad Gita as one of the canonical texts of certain Indian transitions. Prof. Hamilton warns against taking the positions of a particular strand of Indian thought and saying ""this is true Hinduism.""Indeed, she questions whether Hinduism is a useful concept for discussing the historic traditions of India. Various forms of what we call Hinduism are very much at odds with each other and have different sources for their beliefs. For some the Vedantas are the core of Indian spirituality, for others it is the Gita."
1,Disappointed,"The book is not what I expected. I expected an ""organized account"" of the schools of thought in India and not a history of Indian philosophy written in an analytic fashion. I skimmed through the rest of the chapters after reading Chapter 3, ""The Buddha's Middle Way."" It is the most useful chapter as it represented what the Buddha taught. I am not sure where this book belongs: in the trash or on my book shelf. Don't waste your money on Hamiliton's book. Michael Carrither's ""Buddha"" (VSI series) is worth buying."
1,untrustworthy...............!,"Can u imagine a book on indian philosophies without a single mention about bhagavat-gita!!!!This itself makes this book heavily pro-Buddhist!! No wonder, author's bio does indicate that she is a Buddhism scholar. I hope at least scholars could take an OBJECTIVE UN-BIASED stand.sorry!"
3,"Corny, but even better without the extras","Norma Moore and Robert Vaughn do fine considering the material they have to work with in Unwed Mother, that is, if you can believe TV's handsome hero in ""Man From Uncle"" is well cast as a thief/gigilo father of the baby. He's just not mean enough to be ""smearing"" every sweet young thing he touches like his landlady says. The theme song is a bit corny even for 1960. Robert resorts to robbing a movie theatre to pay back the salary our girl in trouble loans him (a forgivable crime at 2008 prices!)The second half of the film improves where we finally discover Moore is pregnant and must live in a home for other single moms on probation. She won't give up her baby even then..but couldn't the older couple adopt both her and the baby? Extras subtract from a badly miscast film when Bob Justman uses all his time to talk about Patrick Stewart in Star Trek."
4,Overall Very Good.,"My Favorite Caedmon's CD was their last album: In The Company of Angels: A Call To Worship. While this effort does not match their last, it is still very good overall. This album seems to focus on grace and mercy. Songs #1, 7, 11, 13 are very good. I would highly reccommend this to any Caedmon's Call Fan!!"
4,One of the better Caedmon's Call albums,"I enjoyed this beautiful album released in 2003 called 'Back Home'. This is probably their best if not close to their best album for this contemporary Christian band that infuses soft rock sounds with folk popish sounds. On this 13 track CD there was a number of standout songs again filled with Christian style messages of faith in one's self and in God. Once again Caedmon's Call star with vocals sung with deep felt sincerity as well as lyrics that are beautiful to listen too and the listener will be able to understand these words clear cut.The songs on this album I most enjoyed were 'Only Hope', 'You Created', 'The Kingdom' and 'Awake My Soul', all uplifting Christian dialogues. Amazing and catchy, you cannot but sing along with this album."
2,Disappointing,"Back Home is Caedmons Call fifth major release, and their first subpar release. Caedmon's Call, once a creative folk/rock group, has lapsed into the lyrical and musical mediocrity of contemporary Christian modern praise and worship music. Gone is the intensity of their self-title debut and 40 Acres. If you are looking for a continuation of classic CC, buy Derek Webb's debut album instead."
3,Lack Originality,"The writing is clear and concise. The passion would fire up each reader. The feeling between the hero and heroine could be felt deeply. But, the subject of the story itself is short of inventiveness. It is a combination of Robocop and Indiana Jones series. The girl is of a tough character just as in any romance genre. The guy is caring, of course. In fact they love each other so much that they end up together but first they have hurdles to jump. In jumping those, the story plays like a rerun in one's head of action movies already mentioned."
4,Disturbing,Very well acted yet incredibly disturbing which made the movie real and scary. The movie shows how abuse creates a monster.
3,A Little Dark,"I rented this movie because I really love Vincent D'Onofrio. (he was in Law and Order Criminal Intent). D'Onofrio is an awesome actor in this movie, but the overall storyline is pretty dark and depressing. Definitely not for kids, and not for people who want a ""feel good"" movie."
5,wow,This is more than horror this movie brings you into a realm of unbelievable first person grief . You can feel the pain of our character.
3,"ok, but no great",It was ok.. i mean the boy couldnt escape after all those years. The plot kinda dragged as well. This didnt do much for me.
3,not your average spooky story,"this is a pretty good story , not what you really expect and really worth the time to watch it"
5,You will be disturbed.,"This is a great film./ The rundown:Crazy serial killer kidnaps a boy and his mom and basically raises the boy as his own sorta son/handservant/slave. It blew my mind. The ""chained"" part is that yet kid is chained to the fridge and has to do the bidding of this crazy serial killer.I was about to be mad at an obvious flaw in the film, but it explained everything nicely./ You have to really pay attention to get the payoff but it's worth it. And D'onoffrio is excellent as the killer. Wow. This is what happens after Law and Order? Mayhem and Murder? Egads. Must buy."
2,Creepy,Vincent is so creepy... as we saw in Salton Sea. He's a terrific actor and easily sets an uneasy mood. If you like D'Onofrio then you will like this movie.
3,Chained,"I thought the movie was more of a repitition of horrible events as a result of the main actors childhood. Not quite sure if that is how he should have played it out. I could appreciate D'Onofrio as an actor as I first saw him in Men In Black and I do watch him in his TV series. The ""son"" tipped the whole story in the end and I didn't see anything in the beginning to make me suspect the outcome. Maybe there might have been a little more suspense to the story without giving the end away. Also, the last I saw of Amy was all cleaned up lieing on the bunk. Really not sure of the final outcome to the ""sons"" decision to carry on. Can't really say more but listen to what you hear while the credits play on in the end and make your own ending"
3,Disturbing,"Both visually and psychologically, but the plot twist was pretty much worth it. I won't give it away - but you'll be surprised."
3,fair movie,"The movie was only fair. It had a couple of frightful moments, but that was it. I didn't enjoy it, and was left feeling ""that's it""? after the film. I really thought it was only mediocre."
5,"So good, so slow.","This movie... requires patience.I came very close to not finishing it, twice. It took me three sittings to finish.It was slow, but well put together. It was gruesome, but for the story's plot, the gore was needed.When I did reach the VERY end, I found it to be an awesome and rewarding movie to watch.Watch the WHOLE movie, even the credits, and listen closely to what is and is not said the entire time."
5,Huh...,"Out of curiosity, why did this movie suck? I see 1 star rating, but no reason as to why. I loved the acting and storyline. Vincent was PERFECT as the cabbie"
2,waste of good talent,"Although VDO is my favorite actor, this movie was almost unwatchable. Such talent wasted on a movie that was so poor, both in content and acting."
4,Very Twisted,Fantastic acting from both main characters. Great psychological horror movie. Worth the watch and has a great twist at the end.
4,"A Mystic's, From Mystic, Mystical Garden","What an irony! A contemplative mystic, who lives in Mystic Connecticut, writes a book of prose and poetry about a year in the life of her garden. What other name could a book like this have? This is a charming little book. It probably will not catch the fancy of more pragmatic people, but then again it doesn't try to. If you are into theology, philosophy, or ""how to"" books, leave this one alone. If you enjoy romance and poetic thought, take time to smell the roses in this mystic garden. Some things are better enjoyed than dissected. This is one of them."
5,magical and poetic,Gunilla Norris is a truly gifted writer. She has a unique way of understranding the world and an equally unique way of communicating that understanding in her books. She savors everyday events and turns them into poetry. She asks us to take the time to appreciate the process of cultivating and nurturing a garden while being mindful of the kind of hard work that goes into creating its beautiful bounty. The parallel to life is clear. This book is a real treasure!
4,Something for the Contemplative Gardener,Lovely reflections/contemplations for gardeners. I will use the book for a gift for friends who are committed to their plants and gardens.
3,In depth- not so clear,"It covers a lot of topics, but I didn't feel it was as clear as it could have been. I wish it would've used more examples."
3,GENIUS AT WORK!!!,"This CD is a mix of Dalida singing in several languages. Very remarkable with musical styles from around the world. All the songs are original versions except ""Am tag als.."" which has an upbeat danceable beat at 128 BPM's. [ There are wonderful remixes of ""Aghani Aghani"", ""Salma ya Salama"", and ""Akhsan nass"" on her LE REVE ORIENTAL CD.]"
4,Great book!,"Explanations of complex terms are simple and easy to understand. Book is layed out well with multiple choice questions after each chapter and other questions and explanations for good comprehension. Definitely recommend this book as a great resource and prep book for A+4 stars because author could do a little better job at explaining some difficult concepts. Overall, excellent book."
4,Jossey-Bass Reader,"Book is a text for a master's class. It is very informative, taking excerpts from books by proven leaders and leadership teams. Not for pleasure, it's great if you're on the move up the ladder."
1,Purchase the new edition!,"I purchased this book for a class, only to discover that it was the old version. Get the updated 2007 version instead!"
4,Many perspectives,"Good compilation of different leadership styles and/or points of view. Great authors in leadership shared ideas. A few (seemingly) dated chapters that cause ""pause"" about the suggested theories. Good foundational text for learning about leadership concepts in school (and to understand school leaders)."
3,Nice look but Not a good fit,Was disappointed in the way they fit. The sizes ran small. I had to reorder another size.
1,"Most worthless, unsupported software ever!!!","This software, and all other EP software, including Budgeting, Scheduling and Movie Magic, is as far from the industry standard as you can get. They do not support their products past even one version. To buy this product is like throwing money in the trash. Don't do it. You will regret it, like we did. Totally worthless. I am thinking of filing a class action against them. They change the activation numbers so you can't use the product, and then the product will not link to their registration website. They want to charge $50.00 more for that. Final Draft, Gorilla, any other software, but not this!"
4,"Very nice book, well worth owning, wish it shipped faster & was HBK","I saw this book mentioned on NBC Nightly News and decided to get a copy as a gift for my brother, just about all I can find to complain about is the long shipping time and the fact that it only comes as a paperback, not hardback.Both in Mr. Hillerman's forward and in the photographer's own text you get some Navajo history and philosophy about how/why things happened and their beliefs. Apparently the ancestral Navajos considered four mountains to be the boundaries of their territory, much of that land is still inside present day reservation borders.The book is divided into four sections, by mountain and north,south,east and west. Each section of the land is represented by some very nice photography, some of it similar to what you might have seen before but more often unfamiliar scenery. It's well worth owning."
5,"Awesome filter, good price","I use this filter on my small-block Chevy race car. It has a beefy metal canister with a ridiculously high crush rating, and feels like you could knock someone out with it if necessary. WIX also performs consistently well in filtering and reliability tests."
5,A delight,"These French opera arias, sung by Frederica von Stade, my favorite mezzo-soprano, were recorded early in her career, and they are a delight. They may not all show quite the expressiveness she developed later, but still there's that lovely mezzo voice, unlike any other and always a pleasure to hear."
4,Great Trance,"This volume doesn't quite start off strong like Volumes 7/10/11 (those are my favorites) but still has a few noticable tracks. [Mercedes - Gliding] is pretty good if you like the female vocal types of trance. One of the best tracks in this CD1 I think is [Kosmonova - Ayla].CD2 is most definitely better than CD1 in this Tunnel Trance Force Volume. It starts off with a pretty fast track [Shoko - Provide]. Some key tracks to listen to are [Sequel Bass - The 3rd Chapter], [Mandala - Australia] which has a little hint of piano instruments, and even [The Atlex - Forbidden Side]. Some of the tracks in CD2 are more of a Hard Trance or House style but in general CD2 is great."
5,Great Story Line!,"Couldn't put it down. From conspiracy theory to Sci-fi to end-time prophesy, the book has it all. I know it's fantasy but it seems like it could all come true. This is a must-get book! Very entertaining."
2,Jamiroquai at Their Most Mediocre,"Jamiroquai can get a little long in the tooth when it comes to experimental jams on stage and this performance is no exception. Combine that with a bad mix of the songs - way too much reverb, improperly-compressed instruments, and muddy mid-range - you are left feeling unsatisfied at the end of almost every song. Jamiroquai CAN and DO sound good and play great - this rating is not their fault mostly. As far as visually, the direction is decent but the camera switching is sloppy. The HD signal is full of sharpening from post and looks quite low-end.I love Jamiroquai in general - I feel bad for them that the production and post-production teams were so sub-par on this one."
1,Not Worth It,"I bought this because it had sections on alternate techniques and were they poor! I learned nothing, and the book was pricey even if it had been useful. I could have written it and I'm certainly no expert on Photoshop. Seems like anyone can throw one out there these days and sucker us in."
4,Moose Tunes,"Great fun. I challenge anyone 0 - 100 Y.O. not to have one or more of these tunes going around and around in their heads after listening. I bought it for the grandkids to learn the songs and to learn about moose.They love it as their friends don't have this. It's a bit special for an Australian kid. I've also ordered the CD so we can play it in the car. It's good fun, well priced."
5,I just wanted a Cessna!,"I'm 78 and I really wanted a real Cessna but my meager income doesn't permit that. It is just a part of my continuing childhood. Maybe I'll grow up to be a pilot. Right now I'm living out my dream of playing baseball in the majors by playing on a Sr. slowpitch softball team. Maybe I'll get a real plane when I'm drafted by the White Sox. I helped my fifth graders build model ships when I taught in the 1960s but this was my first model. It looks great and was fairly easy to assemble. The decals are a challenge but it is a quality kit. I had built a few planes by carving balsa wood and even made one by gluing paper over a paper frame. Back in the mid-40s a cereal (it might have been Wheaties)had a kit in the box that, when assembled, was the controls for the wing and tail attached by household string to a 5"" plane which would respond to the cockpit hand movements by climbing or diving-no rolls. Some fun! Thanks for helping me stay young and foolish. Gordon Kennedy"
3,"Good matches originally, but they're clipped!","WCW Tag Team Titles: Steiner Brothers vs. Nasty BoysSting & Dusty Rhodes vs. Road WarriorsUS Title, I Quit Match: Magnum T.A. vs. Tully BlanchardDog Collar Match: Roddy Piper vs. Greg ValentineWCW World Title: Sting vs. Ric FlairBunkhouse Stampede 1988"
5,Lives up to it's name,"I got it like 7 years ago. It has matches from the NWA, and from early WCW. Some of the matches are Sting & Dusty Rodes vs Road Warriors, Sting vs Ric Flair,the Steiners vs The Nasty Boys, Rowdy Roddy Piper vs Greg The Hammer Valentine in a dog collar match and Tully Blanchard vs Magnum T.A. in a I quit match."
4,Bettmann picture archive,"This book features a great number of drawings from the Bettmann archive, and brief synopses in an ordered presentation of themes within the pictorial histories. I liked the book, it's a great browsing type of read.It's a bit of a tease though, not going into any depth on any particular subject that is brought up. Shame that. I docked it one star for being such a tease. But it does include a complete bibliography and annotations to the sources used, which allow further in-depth research."
4,Terribly Interesting,"A chronicle of the horrors of the 19th century, a time when filth, disease, crime, and overcrowding was rampant in American urban areas. Thought provoking and filled with many lovely morbid illustrations. If you need to be reassured that things really weren't better ""before,"" look no further!"
2,The Good Old Days--In New York,"The title says it all--except that it is largely about the Good Ol' Days in New York City. The title of the book promises more, and its tight focus on the Big Apple is not only a disappointment to readers expecting a broader treatment, but also makes the 'Ol Days less relevant to the general reader. It is the disappointed expectations that cost it three stars. This one definitely goes to the used book shop."
5,Thanks!,I have been trying to get this book for several years. Thanks for having it and sending it so quickly and in such good shape.
1,Don't waste your time,I was hoping for more than a bunch of old photographs with captions. I'm sorry I plunked down my money on this one.
2,Too much use of drawings,"And not enough photographs hinder the book's accuracy.Drawings are someone's coception of a place,person, or event. The comparisons of ameica to Europe`are all unecessary. I feel the police sections are faulty as by 1880 (or even sooner) the police began having alarm boxes on streets in cities. They only spent 15 years (tops) being without communication to the police station hough Bettman conveys the illusion it was a lot longer than that. Bettman generalizes way too much when it comes to city corruption. There had to be some people more honest working in these city governments than he shows it to be. Also, it's worthless to say the police were ""believed"" to have been in on a big Manhatten bank heist in the 1870's. Was there solid proof of their involvement?And who can prove that all that many clergy actually gambled? Many clergy were very fine stalwart non-gambling citizens."
3,Proof Bettman had it in for America specifically,"When describing american trains he mentions the USA's trains had five times as many problems as those of Great Brtain in 1890. Sure the USA""s trains did! In 1890 the US's population was twice that of GB's (a fact Bettman seemingly didn't know or just didn't take into account). Also, we had way more land than GB did and more trains and tracks werre needed to cover all our country. Plus we had more mountain ranges to go over by train than people in GB did. Book is biased after all."
3,"To Roco, about Bettman criticising America",Mr. Bettman in discussing the old days should not have made Europe sound (in any way) superior. It wasn't. It was inferior. He did not have to pick on the US specifically one bit. Yet he did! He was wrong for it.
3,Not enough explanation,"This book is fairly comprehensive in terms of describing various electronic phenomena and the formulas which govern them. However, it is lacking in explanations of why things are the way they are. For a teach yourself guide there is not enough information to build up a good mental model of how electronic components really work. For example, this book teaches you that in a capacitor current leads the voltage by a 90 degree, but it gives absolutely no reason why this is so. If you want to learn the mathematic side of electronics this book would be a great resource, but if you want to understand how electricity and electronic components work in detail, you will be disappointed."
5,Paragon of Electrical Reference Books for Everyone+,"I have read many electrical books,over the years.And this one was a pleasure to work through.The only problem that one might have with the book is that there are no explainations for your answers.So,i would recommend referencing this with other electrical trouble-shooting books.Rea's electronic problem solvers book is a great addendum to explore and inquire over.If your guesstimate assumption is incorrect,it's always comforting to understand why your proposed hypothesis is wrong.Rather than meeting theoretical dead-ends and getting nowhere.I have yet to find the ideal electronics book.This one is still pretty darn good for the sleuthing novice researching advanced electrical uses."
4,Solid Theory,"This provides a comprehensive understanding of electronic theory at the high-school or introductory college level. It focuses more on theory then application and reads like a text-book. For this purpose it is good. It is a bit lighter on the practical side, but reading this first will provide a solid background before setting out to try your hand at home projects.I would highly recommend this for a student considering or seeking a future in electronics or related high-tech fields as it gives a good base of understanding and also a good flavor for what future studies in electronic engineering or design will be like."
2,Don't buy the Kindle version! Broken TOC.,"This really does seem like a great book, and probably five stars for the print version. However the Kindle version does not include a working (linked) table of contents. It's clearly intended to be there as you can get it to work under some circumstances (if you search for a keyword and let the search take you to an entry in the TOC, you can click on it -- but if you simply navigate the TOC from the beginning of the book it won't work.)Amazon phone support says it's a publisher issue beyond their control, and I called the publisher who is going to look into it and maybe it will get fixed, but they didn't exactly fill me with confidence (no guarantees, no follow-up.)But for a book this size, you just can't really use it in electronic format without a TOC unless you want to get really frustrated.I'll revise this review if and when they fix the broken file."
5,Perfect Fit for Anyone Interested in Electronics,"Every great once in a while (not often enough), you're lucky enough to come across the right book at the right time. This is that book for me and probably a ton of other people who are in the same place I am. I am just starting an electronics technician degree program, and this book complements my ""Intro to Electronics"" course perfectly. It should have been our textbook! :-)"
4,what's with that cover?,"I'm no electronics pro, and honestly I haven't even finished reading the book yet. But I really like the lay-out and quizzes at the end of each chapter. One of the things that caught my attention was how it started with such basic information. ""Chapter one; Atoms"", this was a great and logical place to start. Keep your calculator handy though, because by chapter two you're knee deep in, what was for me, pretty advanced calculus."
1,Not very detailed,"This book touches on subjects but does not thoroughly explain anything. I was looking for a soup to nuts, even a good introduction that would explain theory and basic use. This book is not it. I'm still looking."
1,Horrible tasting carnation instant breakfast,"I bought this for my husbandNd after a serious accident and profound weight loss. He wouldn't,t drink it. It tasted horrible and I couldn't return it. Waste of money"
3,Highest Calories,"This is the most concentrated and with the highest calories of all the supplements I have found. The downside is that it is very gluey, even thinned with frozen fruits and extra water in a smoothie. I cannot tolerate it. I find Ensure Plus easier to drink."
4,calories,I have to gave calories added due to not being able to keep solids down and this was a great way.
5,Daily Calories,the carnation Breakfast VHC contains 560 calories per can. It is very tasty. When I was receiving chemo it was the supplement I used to keep my caloric intake close to 3000 per day. I do believe Amazon has the best price per case.
3,Sylvia's 560 review,It does not sting my mouth as others do. For me the product is too thick. I am recovering from radiation therapy on the neck and throat.
4,Damn that was fast,Placed order on a monday got it two days later..price is well enough for the carnation instant breakfasti ordered to regain body weight. would order again.
5,Great Service!!!,I was so amazed how soon I received my order. I believe I placed my order on a Thur and received it on Sat. I have to complaints the seller did such a great job getting my order delivered quickly... Thanks so much I look forward to placing more orders in the future.
1,"VERY FRUSTRATING FOR KIDS AND ADULTS, WOULDNT BUY FOR KIDS UNDER 10","My son is five years old and is a wiz on the computer. We own most of all the construction games sold on amazon. We also have dig and rig and many others.This game was my worst mistake! It has made him so frustrated he sits in tears. I play it to get him to the next level and it is tough for me to get the 3 stars to move on. They put in so many tricks so you really have to be an adult and or pretty smart kid to figure them out.I asked my son, ""are you having fun"" he said nothat was the end of that gamebuy any other one but this unless you are up for a huge challenge"
3,"Gentle, but my cats dont like it like the dry version","Our cats eat the Chicken and rice dry food from this fabulous line and one of them has allergies and a very sensitive stomach, but this is the only food she will tolerate besides human baby food (chicken), but for some reason they wont even touch this. I am giving it 3 stars, im hoping one day they might like it, the ingredients are perfect for a cat and organic without any filler the animals are not meant or able to digest such as corn. Oh well! Glad we have the dry version and would suggest trying this line to anyone for a healthier cat."
1,Bubbles,"It was nice, but came in black. This is not what I thought it would be at all. Thought this was supposed to be blue."
4,Well written fiction,"Homewood creates a submarine world for the reader, that is very real and interesting. The Charactors are slightly simplistic, however given the war time setting it is quite realistic. A must read for adventure lovers."
4,Christiana,"I am a teacher and I saw the movie ""Pilgrims Progress"" many years ago and it had a great impact on my life. When searching for the original movie I came across Christiana. Even though it is an old movie I wanted to show it to my children to inspire them to want to take the road to salvation and make it into the Kingdom of Heaven.Pilgrim's Progress"
2,Not as good as predecessor.,"After watching the Pilgrim's Progress, I was anxious to view the sequel Christiana. It just lacked the same thrill and excitement of the first. However, I would recommend purchasing if you have the first movie."
4,Its excellent for beginners,This book is excellent for beginners. Written in simple way with simple examples. May not be sufficient for seasoned programmers.
2,Stay Away from this Book!!,"I'm amazed that there are 21 reviews, all giving this five stars! We have this book for reference at work, and it is hideous. Examples are inaccurate/incomplete, and it is difficult to locate needed infomation through the index. In my opinion the material is not laid out very well. Save yourself about half the cost and get Korn Shell Programming by Example. It isn't the best I'm sure, but beats this dog hands down!"
1,Waste of listening time and money,"Really, the music industry has come to a very bad state indeed. With artists like Gwen Stefani climbing the charts, it's doomsday for quality music.In one word I can summarize this product - Horrendous."
1,Hate it!,"I don't understand why anyone would want to buy such junk. There is nothing meaningful to be gained from the song's lyrics, and on top of it, the tune is grating to the ear. Hardly mellifluous. More annoying.DON'T BUY THIS!"
1,NOT Audio CD,Maybe I shoud have paid more attention but this is a single only and a DVD not an Audio CD as stated.
1,Horrid - I'd give it zero stars,"I hate this recording, and regret I spent my money on it. It's the worst piece of music I've ever heard, and not worth even 5 dollars. Don't buy it!"
5,Buy this for the remix!,"Yes this song is the single of the year, but the great thing about this single is that is comes with an awesome remix. I have been playing it non stop since I got it! It's worth the price alone!"
4,I'm waiting for to see her live...,"One of the best songs from the album on the first single. Brilliant.The 2 mixes from Jacques Lu Cont are a great 8 minute ones with an 80's feeling.And the extended video is soo extraordinary. I have just only two questions, why don't they released this single as a DVD, and why don't they put a B-side song on it?Maybe they will on the Rich girl single."
2,"uneven mixture of politics, horror and satire","**1/2In ""The Tripper,"" a slasher movie with a political conscience, a serial killer wearing a Ronald Reagan mask stalks a group of anachronistic hippies (so anachronistic they have cell phones along with their tie dye t-shirts and psychedelic van) who have come to the forests of Northern California to celebrate free love and partake in unlimited drug use at a Woodstock-type outdoor event.The Red State/Blue State divide is never far from the filmmakers' minds as a bunch of gun-toting rednecks go up against a group of Flower Power love children who suddenly descend on the area. The saving grace, if indeed there is one, of this gory, but not particularly disturbing, splatter-fest is the tongue-in-cheek humor it manages to display from time to time. Otherwise, this odd little mixture of horror movie cliches and outdated political satire (does anybody really care about the Reagan administration any more?) falls strangely flat."
4,"""Heeeere's Ronnie! "" (""Well, There He Goes Again!"")","I wanted to see THE TRIPPER because I'm a big fan of Jaime King (THEY WAIT, MOTHER'S DAY), and was not disappointed by her performance. As for the rest of the movie, it's a decent story about neo-hippies, hicks, and the murderous-maniac-in-a-Ronald-Reagan-mask who hunts and slaughters them. Yep, we're all invited to the FREE LOVE FESTIVAL, located in the middle of absolutely nowhere. Shockingly, mayhem ensues. As political satires go, this one ain't bad. Gorehundts will love the gooshy stuff, while true flower children may cringe. Worth a watch or two... P.S.- Watch for co-producer, Courtney Cox (in a heinous blond wig!) near the end..."
4,"This film was niether as great as I hoped, or as bad as I feared.","The Tripper, David Arquette's directorial debut, shows a promising future for him as a feature director. A little short on genuine laughs, but not on psychadelia. Seems subversive, but at the same time seems to put down not only right-wingers, but also hippies, police, well, just about everybody. Standout for me was Lucas Haas singing his own material, and being the single likable character in the film."
1,You'd have to be trippin' out to enjoy the tripper!,"This film is appalling. Not in the way 'so bad it's good', but so bad it's very bad. It has nothing to offer, apart from wasting an hour and a half of your life. I got this film for free, and I still feel conned. It's not scary, or gripping, or gory, or interesting. It's badly directed by a bad actor. You will be hard pushed to get past 15 minutes of this fodder without wanting to turn it off, but you keep watching thinking it has to get better, which it doesn't.Even if you're a fan of old skool stalk 'n slash, or low budget zombie flicks, or 80s video nasties, or any genre of movie, you will not like this crap."
1,unintentional humor,"This is a terrible waste of time, the comedy isn't funny but the horror is. Very poorly made, lame dialogue, typical cheap direct to DVD garbage. The pink blood didn't help the gore factor either."
3,Lesser of two Felixes,"GENIUS ENTERTAINMENT issued their _____ and other Cartoon Treasures series in two formats:1.) A 90-minute disc packed in a heavy paper jacket (as this one is),and2.) a plastic slimline cased DVD containing 2 full hours of cartoons.The superior 2-hour version ofFELIX THE CAT AND OTHER CARTOON TREASUREScontains all the shorts found here, plus several more.(see my review by clicking on title)"
4,a great suspense story for quick minds,"Like the other book I read by this author, The Curtain and the Earth, this is a really gripping story with a doozy of an ending. The problem I had with both is that the books are written with such a huge emotional distance, it's tough to connect with the characters. This book is full of suspense and has a very interesting storyline, and the last twenty or so pages, when huge parts of a dead city are blown to kingdom come all at once by one of the main characters, feel so real it's as if it were a movie happening all around you. The ending is also great and jarring because it's such a different atmosphere from what came before, completely unpredicted. Overall, I'd say this is the work of a great and clever writer, just expect what you read to be so cerebral that you really have to be a patient thinker to get the emotional impact of what's in there."
4,Definitely helpful,"Engaging Autism has been one of my mainstays for working with families with children in the autism spectrum. I have been able to teach them simple strategies from the Floortime method that allows them to quickly see glimmers of engagement with their children. Dr. Greenspan's explanations of why these children have problems and how to help them find us worth joining is very thoughtful.Parents that I have recommended this book to have come back with a better appreciation of the struggles and strengths of their children. They are more ready to get down to their child's developmental social-emotional level to allow them to grow, thus enabling them to be available to the other therapies that are needed.Not everyone has a Floortime/DIR trained therapist available to work with them, but with this book they at least have some strategies to include as they play with, work with, and learn to enjoy the child they have."
4,Good resource,This is a difficult subject but this book is very informative.My grandsons teacher recommended it and I find it helpful.
4,"Engagging Autism: Helping Children Relate, Communicate and Think with Dir Floortime Approach",This is an amazing book and I feel it's a must read. I just started working with Autistic children and this book has helped me with examples to help the children play and learn social skills.There is a ton of information and many wonderful examples for everyone to learn from.
4,Good book would be great if it didn't blame the parents for everything even after saying there is a multiply reasons for autism,This would be a great book if it didn't blame the parents for lack of interaction everytime you turned the page. This book takes a serious step back in blaming refrigerator moms. shame on them. It does have some great techniques though.
5,Words of hope,"This book was given to me after my daughter was diagnosed with autism (among other things) and I was told that there was no hope for progression. The first thing that I discovered in reading the book is that my daughter does NOT have autism. How autism should be diagnosed and the mistakes that are often made in diagnosing were enlighting and I only wish I had read the book before I paid lots of money for a wrong diagnosis. The second thing that I learned is that there is ALWAYS hope regardless of the diagnosis. As far as the DIR/Floortime approach, I think that it would help any child (developmental problems or not) become happy and emotionally stable and reach his/her full potential. I implemented just a few of the principles as I was reading and saw immediate results. I plan to implement much more. The book is great - not only does it give you a plan, but it offers real hope."
5,Excellent Resource,"I have been a fan of Stanley Greenspan since I switched from treating adults to treating children. I am an occupational therapist and Dr. Greenspan's books have been a guiding force in treating all of the children on my caseload, not only the ones with autism specturm disorders. If ABA is just not working for you or you are looking for a an approach that will build a closer relationship with your child, read this book. I would also recommend the book The Special Needs Child, also by Greenspan.The books teaches you how to get your ""tuned out"" child's attention. How to get your child to begin to communicate with you. How to build communication from fleeting moments to real back and forth communication.I use the recommendations from this book everyday in my practice and I frequently recommend it to my client's parents."
2,not for everyday use,Very nice looking for the price point but not for everyday use. I have had it for about 4 months now and the silver is starting to come off and it showed visible scratches early on. Also the clasp opens easily and I am surprised it hasn't fallen off me. For the price it is a nice watch to wear once in a while.
3,proud of,"really proud having your product in my hand, it look so gorgeous..so sexy... i love it, hope i can buy your other product even i have to safe my money first..."
4,alright,"I bought this as a gift for my friend. It looks very nice, although not as nice as the photo indicates. The only complain so far is that it's a little loose on the wrist, even though it is 'adjustable'."
1,This is the worst CD I have ever heard.,I can't imagine anyone wanting to keep this once they've heard it. Please spend your money elsewhere. Anywhere else.
4,Pocket Rocket,"The best vibrator there is, fast response and in 0 to 100 in no time. The solution for women that can not or have difficulty to orgasm!Doc Johnson The Original Pocket Rocket 4-Inch Ivory Vibrator"
2,Only if you are a complete newbie,"I bought this book based on rave reviews on Amazon.com. However, I pretty disappointed. It's nicely produced and has lots of pretty good pictures, but it should be considered only a bare-bones introduction to sheet metal work for beginners. It very briefly covers all the basic topics related to making sheet metal items for car bodies, aircraft, etc. But it does not go into nearly enough detail to cover any of these topics. It's more like an overview of basic tools and techniques. You could find all this information just by surfing the web. I give it a thumbs down."
2,old pictures,"its the same with all hp books a bunch of worthless non informative pictures you paid for that teach you nothing!!!!!,go on the net and find better!!,your wasting your money buying hpbooks!!!!!"
4,"Pretty, big, maybe too big....","This item is much bigger than I thought in both volume and height; utensils kind of get lost in it. If you have tons of utensils, it might be perfect for you."
4,"Very nice, but huge!","This is listed as a 'utility crock'.. and I do really like it, the color is perfect, but it is so wide! it's about 6 inches across! i thought it would be a lot smaller, about 1/2 that. i thought the '7 inch' was height, which it is, but the width is darn close to it! Just a warning; other than it's just as listed and the color is spot on."
2,in a high wind area,"I got this because I live in a high wind area and I was under the impression it would be suitable for that. The stitching seems to be holding better that most flags, but the 2nd day it started to pull away from the brass holes where the material is. I don't know exactly what to do about this. It is holding for the moment. It seems the brass is not crimped tightly enough to the material and has stretched so the holes in the material are now too large to be re-crimped. Nice flag though."
4,Mixed Review,"The flag was just what I ordered, and arrived in perfect shape. It just took some time to arrive, probably about two weeks - which is within the time Amazon promises delivery, but then again they grant themselves an eternity to get stuff to your door.Overall, everything was just fine. Perhaps just curl up with a good book and enjoy the Amazon wait."
4,"Winter's Journey, an excellent Christmas CD","After playing Winter's Journey along with many other Christmas CD's at a recent holiday gathering at our home, our guest all wanted the name of the Winter's Journey CD. It was clearly an excellent CD for the season."
4,Not quite Spanish but very soothing,Not quite Spanish but very soothing. I listened to the CD in the background for several acupuncture sessions and bought it thinking it was a Spanish singer. She comes close enough and I am happy with the CD
3,Few holes in smooth whole,"3 1/2Clean country-prog filtered through jamband finesse amounts to a satisfyingly whole, if not wholly satisfying, serving of re-lived screams."
5,BEST jamband studio album ever,"This is the type of musicianship that I have come to love from this group's live shows. I found moe. during the recent Phish hiatus and have never looked back. They are great musicians.This album is tight with segues (segways) into most of the songs (My Favorite is Wormwood > Okayalright) just like their live shows. Between this album and Phish's new one Round Room, my two favorite bands have finally produced studio albums that are worthy of their live show status."
5,Amazing,"Far and away the best moe. album to date. Very fresh sounding compared to recent efforts like dither. There is what some fans would consider alot of ""filler"" on the album, however these tracks such as rumble strip, bend sinister, etc, help tie tha album together perfectly. If you are new to moe. I would suggest seeing them live before making any final judgments. These guys are a force to be reckoned with. Highlights of the album are Crab Eyes>Bullet>Kyle's Song, it just flows so perfectly. BUY IT NOW!!!!!"
5,EXCELLENT BOOK,I found this book to be a refreshing look at Zen Buddism using practical life experiences as helpful examples. This book demonstrates how listening as a Zen practice is effective in every aspect of our lives. The path to enlightenment is a very difficult one and Zen Master Dae Gak's book is a helpful stop along the way.
5,As a piece of art it does its job.,The writing is wonderful. It pulls you into the relationship and makes you just as anxious as Griffin and Sabine. It is a wonderful and yet frustrating boook. I highly recommend it.
4,"a little tragedy, a little joy....","I found the book very satisfying....until the end, that is, and then I felt let down because there was no more.While I enjoyed the artwork, I think that the overall experience could have been better had it not all been printed on slick stock paper, though I do understand the financial ramifications of mixing up paper textures.All in all, though, a wonderful read, which I must now go and purchase for my own library."
4,Be Creative,"I think what Nick Bantock is saying more than anything in these books is to put your ideas and feelings down on paper, instead o just thinking about it. I actually am not so enthralled by what his drawings and prints look like as I am impressed at his creativity and his freedom of expression. The books are a masterpiece of art direction. Flawlessly executed and well-made, they are also inspiring to have and look at, even if one is simply thumbing through them. Of course, the story ties it all together, so the drawings and craft pieces make some sort of sense. Not great literature, but a genuine 'art' book."
1,Dreck,"I had a psychotic girlfriend who loved these booksand tried to get me to read them. ""Aren't they beautiful?""Whenever I read see these books, it reminds me of being stalked by a lunatic.This book is fuel for all of the twisted, psychotic, neurotic,witchcraft-dabbling women out there."
4,Beautiful books to be enjoyed for years.,I love my boxed set of the Griffin & Sabine Trilogy. They are such beautiful books and for some reason it makes their story so much more thrilling to be reading their cards and letters. I have given these books to friends as gifts and they have been received with amazement. Truely amazing books.
2,A Quick Read,"I'm not sure why these books were on the New York Times Bestsellers list for as long as they were, other than they are a bit of a fun read. The artwork is interesting and the gimmicky theme of reading other people's mail may hold some fascination. The characters are poorly developed and the story leads nowhere in particular. These books are ideal for those with short attention spans and limited intellegence, A good pick for travel reading.The Griffin & Sabine Trilogy Boxed Set: Griffin & Sabine/Sabine's Notebook/The Golden Mean"
5,Hope he gets the Grammy...,"This CD is a major departure from Ronnie Milsap's long list of country hits. The good news is... his voice has never sounded better. I love the brassy, big-band accompaniment on ""I Don't Want Nobody to Have my Love but You"" and ""My Babe."" Just like he does on all his country love songs, Milsap brings true romance to songs like ""Teach Me Tonight.""I understand this CD is up for a Grammy. I hope Ronnie Milsap wins!"
2,"Right Tunes, Wrong Voice","Milsap jumped on the ""standards"" bandwagon with this one. Unfortunately he's no Sinatra or Bennett and fortunately he's no Rod Stewart, either. If you want to hear these tunes as they were intended to be performed, stick with the old benchmark recordings."
4,Needed upgrade for the PR3000,"I purchased a Bowflex PR3000 and the 310 pound upgrade at the same time. Due to backorder the upgrade didn't arrive until now. I've been working out with my bowflex for a couple weeks and have a few exercises where more resistance was desired. This is the fix.The upgrade is simple, remove the cartridge with the existing power rods, pop out the plugs, insert the 'upgrade' rods (two rods at 50 pounds each) and use the fastening screws at the bottom to retain the rods. You then install the cartridge back into the base of the Bowflex.Sounds easy, yes. But it's a bit of a trick removing and reinstalling the basic rod pack with the Bowflex fully assembled. If you've got a short/stubby phillips-head screwdriver, you can remove the existing rod pack with some contortions of your wrist and arm. Had these arrived with the machine, installation would have been much easier.They seemed to work pretty well, added the resistance I desired."
3,not the same as the original,"I was expecting....or should I say hoping for these to be identical to the originals, but they're not. They do function the same and look the same, but the resistance on these is more comparable to the original 30# in lieu of the 50#. I kept them because there was not much alternative, but I left this review so you would hopefully be prepared for what you are getting."
3,The rods didn't come with connecting attachments,"Rod where in great shape, but can't them until we find a connecting attachment. So the rods are now useless for now."
1,No base plate,"The rods them selves were indeed shipped but only the rods. I thought (incorrectly) that they would be attached to a base plate which would slide on to the back of the rest of the rods already equipped on the bow-flex. However, they are simple the rods alone, separate, and attached to nothing. And I can not, for the life of me, find the correct base plate. And I can not find any way to contact this buyer directly to ask him how to get it. If he can point me in the right direction, I would be more than happy to switch this review to a 5 star. I just want to be able to use the rod's I was sent."
5,Great gift,Bought this for my husband as a gift for his birthday. I really liked how easy it was to add to his boflex. And that it came so quickly.
1,they sold this as a package to the p1000,this part doesn't even fit the p1000 because the p1000 is not upgradable. cant believe they would sell me this knowing that what a waste of 100 bucks. do not buy this! you cant use it with the p1000 and probably with alot of other bow flex.
2,These rods are weaker than the originals,"The resistance of the 50 pound rods in the 310-Pound upgrade is noticeably less than the resistance of the 50 pound rods that came with the machine. They feel like they ought to be labeled 35 pounds because they feel just a hair more resistant than the 30 pound rods. While I am still a novice girlyman with the machine and body sculpting in general, the upgrade has not provided enough extra resistance for me to feel the burn doing leg presses. I believe that if the resistance matched the old rods, they would have been adequate.On the good side, I got them installed quickly and easily, and delivery was prompt."
1,Not 50 lb rods,There is no way these rods are 50 lbs. maybe 30 lbs. at most. Are not rubber coated like originals. They do not retain there shape like original ones. Very disappointed.
3,Necessary.,"If you use your bowflex at all, it won't be long before you need these. 210 lbs seems like a lot but I think ""bowflex pounds"" are a bit lighter than regular pounds. :) One word of warning: I would order these at the same time you order a bowflex. Otherwise the 50lb rods included in the bowflex will be ""softened up"" and these will seem disproportionately strong. Get these and alternate which 50lb set you use so they both ""soften"" at the same rate."
1,Defective item,One of these rods snapped in half in less than 30 days. I really expected better of Bowflex. My original 210lbs set hasn't had an issue.Now I have to waste time dealing with Amazon's poor return policy or trying to get Bowflex to replace it.
1,Won't work on the 1000,These don't work on the 1000. They were also different from the ones that come with the factory unit. I had to send them back.
2,Expensive,"From experience I would recommend purchasing a Bowflex with the 310 or 410 upgrade included. I quickly outgrew the 210 pound ""entry level"" model."
1,Defective,I snapped this new 50 lb upgrade on the FIRST PULL! This is ridiculous! What a big mistake getting the bowflex.
5,One Sizzling Smoking Big Band Sound,"The Pratt brothers have put together one heck of a CD that really swings and burns the charts with their music. Roberta sings like an angel and adds a mellow flavor to what is primarily a contemporary big band sound. One of the best CDs in my collection. Can't get enough, I play it all the time. Highly recommended."
4,Tons of info!,"I had heard so many great things about this book, that I had to buy it. I am Wiccan, but I have never really studied the fairy folk that much. This book was packed with info. In fact, I almost wish I had read some ""lesser"" works first, so I would have a little better understanding. At some points in the book, I felt a bit lost. Besides this, this is an outstanding book in every way. It's so great to see some books published by someone other than Llywen."
3,Beads of Glass,The book has a good cross section of artists and techniques to inspire any bead maker.
1,Enjoyable and engrossing novel,it is well written and a real page turner. J. Mastroianni first novel is powerful and a winner.
4,A challenge,Programing this radio can be a real challenge. I managed to get both wakeup alarms accidently set. It took a lot of work to get them cleared. I still am not sure how I got rid of them. The sound quality is very good with a very good readout message. It does need a simpler method to program.
2,Weak,This novel is not as successful as Peter Temple's detective novels. There are no sympathetic characters. The plot is minimally coherent. And he doesn't do nearly as well with Hamburg as he does with Melbourne.
1,GE 29369GE1 Big Button Phone,"This is a rotten product in my opinion. I bought it particularly for the speakerphone feature, but I was very disappointed. It's not a duplex. It's a push to talk feature. The system trys to determine when you are finished talking, then switches to the other party so he can talk. But that often cuts you off before you finish speaking. Very poor device. I recommend you pay more money to get a duplex (2-way) speakerphone."
1,OK except.....,"I like the phone except for one REALLY BAD problem. The handset does not fit properly on the phone, it is too easy to incorrectly place the phone on hook (you think it is on hook, but it isn't). I have had the phone a couple of months, and this problem has rendered my phone line dead (no dial tone) about 10 times now. When my other phones don't work, I have to go put the handset of this phone back on properly. Never had this problem with any other phone."
2,Very disappointed,"Got this phone and was good for first 2-3 months. Then mouthpiece became inactive meaning others could not hear me talking. Talked to Thompson (the manufacturer for GE) and sent the phone, receipt etc per their instructions. 3 months up and still no action from from Thompson. Amazon was kind enough to intervene and refund me the full amount. I am trying to avoid GE phones if Thompson is the manufacturer."
2,off the hook,This telephone is very difficult to hang up. Additionally the loudest ring is not loud enough for an ederly hearing imparied person. I am keeping the phones but this item is the worst thing I've ever purchased from Amason
3,Easy to read Big Button phone,This is a very good phone if you are interested in Big and Easy numbers to read. The angle of the phone is perfect and makes seeing the caller ID great. The receiver occasionlly does not hang up well enough and that can be a problem.You need to be careful and check it. The price is surely right.
3,Great for home office,"This is great for a one line operation at home. I found that I don't need all the ancillary buttons that most phones have. The speaker phone is a little lousy, but most are. The LCD is nice and big too."
2,looks good,Had a big button GE phone that worked well so bought another one. This unit's microphone cannot pick up anything so the speakerphone feature is useless (you can hear but noone can really hear you talk). What you end up sounding like is every first word you say is dropped and intermittently misses other words you say in a sentence- and this is standing right by the the phone with my mouth two inches away from the location of the mic. Pros: Buttons are big enough and screen is big enough to see the caller id and number.
4,OK Phone,"The best things I like about the phone are the back lighted display. It lights up so you can easily see the caller ID when you get a call, the letters are large enough to easily read and the large keypad buttons. The only nitpicks I have with this phone are the handset feedback squeal at the higher volume settings, the lack of a hold button and a message waiting light."
3,Phone,"The phone is alright with the exception of really power volume on the speaker phone option. It is not lound enough to hear the caller or the caller to hear you with any background noise in the area. If myou turn the volume all the way up you get a repeating ""squeling"" feedback noise."
3,Easy to use,"Great phone, easy to use, but speaker is not very loud on the other end. You can hear pretty good, but the other caller cannot."
1,power supply ommission,Product description fails to mention phone needing external power supply to operate. This is deceptive.
2,Not for Wall Mount!,"I bought this, needing a replacement wall phone with large Caller ID. I just installed it and now regret getting it. The CID display is directional, and designed for a desktop. If you look at it straight-on you can barely see it, having to crouch down and look up to read it. CID display lettering is very blocky and crude. There is no indicator light, as we had on our previous phone, that blinks to let us know someone had called while we were away. The face is also curved for a desktop, so when you wall-mount it the lower part curves down and inward making you, yet again, crouch down to use it. In addition the ringer is very shrill and annoying.I would love to get my money back, but since it came from a source outside of Amazon, it is non-returnable now that it has been opened.Guess all I can do is to get a few token dollars back selling it on eBay."
4,nice phone,very nice phone.all the complaints about the reciever falling off are because the wall mount bracket needs to be installed right.large caller id screen is great.very nice
5,A bargain phone that delivers,"This phone was intended as my principal phone (living room.) It lived up to expectations--performing functions that the phone it replaced was supposed to--but didn't. The set-up menus are clearly written and easy to follow, and the end result is a well-functioning phone at a price less than half of the phone it replaced. A winner here."
2,big button phone GE,"I should've sent this phone back. The initial calling out works fine, but to retrieve messages or continuewhen prompted on menus, pushing the buttons won't allow one to proceed. So I'm back at our other, old phone when I know I need to retrieve from my message line.The speaker phone part works fine, as does the caller ID which we needed.If you get this phone and have problems, don't hesitate like I did to send it back within the 30 days."
2,I Bought 2 phones and one went defective in 3 weeks,I had to trash one of the 2 phones. The display went unreadable and the phone would not work at all.
3,LCD display designed for a different angle...,"I like the big buttons & easy to use design, and like that it will run fine without power (may not get caller-ID w/o power but I don't care about that). What really sucks though is the LCD display when viewed straight on is very dim even when contrast is cranked-- and if you tilt it down the display will go completely blank. Optimum display viewing occurs when the phone is tilted back about 45 degrees, but that isn't ever how I see it. Looking down on it from above and usually the display text is invisible. Contrast doesn't seem to adjust view angle of LCD, just bright-dark so it's really no help. Great phone but with serious flaw."
2,Handset issue,"I bought this knowing there was an issue with the handset not sitting properly from reading the prior reviews. I was hoping it was due to user error but in fact it is due to poor design. You really have to play close attention to how you replace the handset or it will not hang up. Unfortunately the volume is not very loud on the handset so you can not rely on the ""off the hook"" sound to warn you either. I would only recommend this phone to someone who will not be using it all the time."
4,Great Phone at a Great Price,"My grandmother is nearly blind and loves this phone. The numbers are huge and easy to enter. I love the feature that, before you pick up the phone or turn on the speaker phone, you can dial the number and make sure you have entered it right before you pick up the phone. And you can backspace, if you entered a wrong number, so you don't have to enter the whole number over again.I would give this item five stars, but the handset doesn't feel secure when you hang it up. It feels like it could slide right off, even if it never does."
3,"Nice pictures, never before heard of weapons, OK research","This addition of Jane's Guns Recognition guide deserves both praise and criticism. It covers a magnificent spectum of weapons from all over the world, but stops short of including new weapons, has inaccurate details (the caliber of several weapons is completely wrong).If you have a working knowledge of firearms already, don't waste your time. If you are just getting started, it might be worth you while."
3,reference book,I have a very consistent library on weapons.This book is a useful quick reference source.
1,Huge disappointment,"Loved the first two books in the trilogy. Didn't enjoy this one much, but wanted to finish it. I wish I hadn't. I've read dozens of AD&D books, including many by Ms. Cunningham, so I am familiar with Forgoten Realms and usually enjoy Ms. Cunningham's writing style. Not this one. She ruined all the characters that she got us to like in the previous books. Plus, she waaaay overdid all the song nonsense. It was much too much and reading it was making my brain hurt. I'm going to stay away from her books now."
4,Good Book,"I have to agree with the Kohler review. I think they really could have gone somewhere if they kept him alive.I have to say, this was the first Fantasy novel I've read. I'd been bored and yup, I did it, I saw the cover and bought it. I searched all my resources for the first two books to no avail. So I went ahead and read it without a background.I'm pleased to say, I liked it. I liked the realationships within the different ""Species"" if you will and the descriptions were wonderful. It did get a bit jumpy and I found myself flipping back pages trying to make sense of it. Though I'm sure if I had read the other books I would have known more. :)"
2,Poor effort,"The Liriel who was not above killing, but did not enjoy it has been replaced by someone who kills first and asks questions later. Drow are everywhere; you can't walk 30 feet through Waterdeep without bumping into one. Everyone has a smart aleck answer to everything. And the bad guys kill (or attempt to kill) everyone they come into contact with.Poorly told story I had to drag myself to complete."
4,"Finally, Book 3!","Not as strong as the first two books, but if you already bought the first two, might as well complete the series and buy book 3! Don't get me wrong, it isn't terrible!! But do know that if you don't get it, you'll miss out on the surprise ending that you never saw coming, or at least I didn't see it coming!! You won't be disappointed."
1,Awwws for Liriel,"I loved the first book of the series, liked the second but I have to admit that I hate the conclusion of the saga. It was more like a children bedtime story than a filled with drows book. =("
3,Doesn't live up to the first two,"I really enjoyed Daughter of the Drow, and Tangled Webs was pretty good, but it seemed that this series went a bit downhill as it continued. Liriel looked almost weak and killing off Fyodor wasn't, in my eyes, a very good idea. Plus, Liriel giving Shatki the mask to take on her form was just confusing. I expected an epic battle between Liriel and Shatki but it was a bit of an anti-climax. It was overall a good series, but I wish the ending was different."
3,Starlight & Shadows Book 3,"a somewhat disappointing end to the trilogy.i felt like it jumped around a fair amount, and left much more to be desired at the end."
5,awesome! the best ever! totally sucks you in!,"i don't care what other people have said! This is the best work of art i have yet to read in the Forgetten Realms! Elaine is my favorite author! She sucks you into the characters and into their journeys! It's like you are right there in their minds...with them on their journey and experiencing every emotion they are going through!! This book totally made me cry, and that is a hard thing to do! I was so caught up in in Liriel's journey with Fyodor...and their struggle... I recommend this series to EVERYONE! it is the most amazing work of art, a true masterpeice."
1,Beyond bad,This is the least satisfying conclusion of a trilogy I have ever read. Poorly written with a jumbled plot that was impossible to follow. New characters randomly introduced far too often and not enough development of the characters that I cared about. Many of the plot developments were completely unnecessary and very unsatisfying. I wish I hadn't read this book so that I could have imagined a more satisfying conclusion to the tale.
3,Main characters not in it as much...,"About 3/4 of the way through this book, I realized that the two main characters had barely been in it! Some new faces and old foes (plus a link to the War of the Spider Queen series) almost take the main stage. While it didn't feel like the stories of the secondary characters were tacked on, if the book had just featured Liriel and Fyodor it would have been much, much shorter. It wasn't bad, but as far as it being the last book in a trilogy, I would've expect more."
3,burst bubble,"when i first started reading the Windwalker series I couldnt put down the firt 2 books and i ws fortunate to start it when the final book came out for a conclusion. i had hoped that this last book would be just as good as the first 2 but i was mistaken, not only was it confusing in some parts at the end but i feel it ended poorly when it comes to our main characters. Liriel is such a wonderful character but it seems all that she has worked for exstremely bittersweet,yes, she now can keep her drow sorcery but she lost the one she had just amitted to loving and what about the deities, which will it be that will claim her in the end? those she wanted to accept her turn her away and to what end, it heartrenching because she wants accptence and will possilbly nevr find it- the very end leaves me with a big question mark hanging over it. she may have 2 new allies but to what purpose, they are still leary about her"
5,"Nothing but fine, old time blues","Every once in a long while you get to hear really skilled musicians devote themselves to a unique historic style and feel. The Bluesville Bombers is a band comprised of such musicians. Each number on this CD is authentic and delivered to your ears with a concern for the craft, guts, grit and joy of playing and hearing the real thing. It's the kind of band someone like Ry Cooder would enjoy jamming with. BRAVO, Bluesville Bombers! Let's have another CD real soon. PS--I heard this band live, and they ""kick butt"" for real."
1,Mad Fan,This is a great harmonica driven blues band. The lead guitar really kicks it. The harmonica player recently put his girlfriend in the band. She plays classical flute and it just doesn't sound right. Looking forward to their next CD and hoping for no flute.
3,"interesting, if you are from Europe","I found this book to be interesting regarding the history of glass and full of great photos, but a bit irrelevant unless you live in Europe or have access to old European glass. If I travel to Europe, I will find the book helpful as a resource."
4,Great product for a great price!,"I am happy with this product for the price I paid. Shipped quickly and arrived timely. I will never buy a print cartridge with a brand name again.The only negative thing I have to say about the cartridge is at times it leaves small black ink spots on the right margin, but that could just be my printer.A great product for a great price. Would definitely recommend to others!"
2,Bait and Switch Seller! Beware!,"I purchased this ""Verbatim"" toner but instead got an unlabeled, generic toner cartridge. Since the price was cheap, I installed it anyway and it worked fine. Had it not worked or left streaks, this would be one star plus it would be returned."
2,Does not fit 1320,"I purchased this cartridge because Amazon said it would replace the cartridge in my HP LaserJet 1320. The HP cartridge is a Q5949A. This cartridge replaces the ""Q2613X"" ONLY. It might work flawlessly in the right machine, but don't use it on a 1320 series."
3,Very nice but small.,"This is very nice if you did not have to use a magnifying glass to make out the shape. I'm sure it looks like the picture but hard to tell. The crystal is pretty as Swarovski is prone to be but the legs, head, etc. are hard to make out. Wish I knew better how to interpret the sizing given on the item."
4,An Overview of the Human Mind's Place in the Universe,"This is an excellent introductory text to the place of the human mind in the cosmos. I believe that for those just beginning to think about these issues, this book is an excellent place to start. In the end, I was forced to downgrade this book a little because it is just too broad a subject. Each chapter dabbles in an interesting area and then moves on without pursuing the issues at any length. Don't get me wrong, it's interesting stuff, but all but the most casual reader will be left wanting to know more. (Maybe that's not a bad thing.)"
1,Anecdotal.,"Book based on lectures by the author.The treatment of the main subject 'the relation between the universe and the mind' through neurology and SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) is very superficial. Only roughly one half of the book covers this subject.The construction of a central nervous system through the Milky Way seemed to me bad science fiction.Another part of the book is based on the work of Edward O. Wilson 'The diversity of life', the DNA structure and oriental mysticism.The book of Edward O. Wilson is a must, not this one."
1,Great title for a book I just don't get.,"A friend gave me the audio tape version of The Minds Sky and I was so disinchanted with what I heard that I visited Amazon.com, read a couple of reviews then ordered the book version thinking I must have just missed ( again and again) the points and story line Mister Farris was putting forth. Fact is I didn't ""get it"" from the book version either - I have been amused, bemused and found some great themes opened up by Mr. Ferris but almost universally found his own comclusions to be way off the mark . The man does not know how to think. There is some flaw or serious ommision in his logic ( or in mime ) I suggest you get the book, study it then lets keep hammering on him with reviews until he rewrites it."
1,trebbible quality,we bought these as a back up pair for the ones that came home from the hospital....they fell apart after several uses
3,vew,The thigh part doesn't stay up on your thighs. Too loose. The elastic on the stockings not tight enough. The stockings itself is very good
2,A Life of Jesus by Basil Mathew s,"Excellent book! Every Christian should read this book. Also, if you want to know how the English language should be written even in light today's ""gutter"" type speaking expositors of the English language, this book will remind you of how wonderful and gentle the language used to be spoken. Mathews' style is reminiscent of a kinder, gentler world. This book is in very good condition and sent by a great Amazon seller. Perfect transaction"
1,Bad....,"Kraig's writings are easy to read. But its contents is very poor.I am a Taiwanese. My English is quite crappy. Then, I received this book two months ago, and read it completely.It is because its boring.Mostly of tips in this book are the same in ""Modern Magick"".(kraig's another magick book-worthy to read) In spite of a little detail abount basic ceremoncial magick practice, other contents are his arrogant words.I have some regrets for buying this book. It wastes my money."
4,Great Decorations,"I use these to print up credit card sized pictures of the kids and decorate my laptop lid, luggage, thermos and whatever else. Beware: once you stick one of these to something, it won't come of easily or intact."
3,Simple and brief,"I feel that this book is quite simple and colourful, mostly are graphics with some paragraphs next to it. This book has a lot of interesting graphics, which I do not mind since it is an ATLAS. I will recommend this book for those people who is looking for some enjoyable reading. Since it has a very colourful pictures in every pages and the content is not too technical, I finished reading this book in half a day."
3,Not As Described,Described as super thin TOSLINK. Not what I received (and not what is in the picture). Unsure of quality and construction.
3,Wrong fitting,Cable didn't work because it wasn't compatible with my equipment. This was no fault of the vendor as I was not aware when I ordered the item that this could be a problem.Price was good and quality was excellent and item will work fine with proper equipment.
5,Great solution...amazing quality,I bought this cable to be used on my mini-mac (althought works with any mini-plug headphone conection)to connect the audio line to my home theather receiver as a digital signal....this is a whole new level of audio quality in comparison with the analog signal...try it.
4,nice accesory for MAC,"I got this one for very cheap... it carries digital (optical) signal from minplug-like jacks to optical TOSLINK inputs. I used it to get digital quality sound from my Macbook and it does so perfectly. The only thing, is that the optical end does not stay quite fixed into the optical jack, so any touch will take it out inmediately."
2,hmm,didn't work for me but for the price im not complaining too much.. i tried connecting my HDTV's optical 'out' to the mini plug 'in' of a sound bar using this cable...
1,Loose Toslink connector,"Purchased cable to connect a new Aiport Express to a Denon AV Receiver. The Toslink connector did not fit snugly into the Denon Toslink input port. Even with a poor fit it seem to work OK for a few days, then no more music. After repeated attempts to remove/insert both ends of the cable and reset all devices, still no music. So I reverted to my analog cable and threw this away."
5,"Yup, it works with your Airport Express","If you have an airport express and aren't using it, then well, you're not getting the full potential of your music. My airport express is 3 years old and I wasn't sure if this cable was compatible. It is compatible and it truly makes a difference. Skip the Starbucks and do yourself a favor."
2,Does not follow the book,I was disapointed that this DVD did not follow the book as closely as it could have. The end was different from the book.
2,Not what I thought.,"I got this movie after reading the reviews here. I was very disappointed. I'm giving this two stars only because of the message it conveys. If not for that I would give it 1 star. I know this was done in the 70's, but it seemed to me that it was rushed. Too much of the book was missed. I felt the chanting was rather distracting, espically when the movie was beginning to peak. I thought the animated version (even though it is slow) was much better. I really hope that someone does another movie and or even a mini series, that way they can touch on the whole book."
2,Stilted but,"This video was a bit of a disappointment. It seems awkward at points, and does not really represent Bunyan's text all that well, especially after the appearance at the cross. It seems neither a faithful rendering nor a theatrical interpretation, but it is useful in showing how folks have adapted the original Bunyan to emphasize different things, in this case the role of the Devil and the importance of conversion rather than sanctification."
1,"Wow, I was VERY displeased with this movie!",The acting was pretty flat. It is not a very good portrait of John Bunyons original book.
1,Don't Bother with This,I read the book and it interested me in this movie. It took me almost 3 days to watch it. I kept stopping it because it was hard to watch. If I saw this before reading the book I would never of read the book. The book is awesome. The movie is terrible.
1,Pilgrim' Progress in Review,"We felt, after viewing the movie, that the integrity of the book was lost. The movie was not well done and I would not recommend it to others. The book is far better than the movie portrays."
5,AMAZING,"Just bought the CD...I have to tell you, you are missing out if you do not have this in your collection. It is the perfect kind of music to listen to if you are showering, doing homework, or just lounging around the house. Perfect beats and easy listening. A MUST own!"
5,*Swoon*,"This boy has one HELL of a voice.The piano pop-rock is an amazing accompaniment to his truly special vocal capabilities.As I am going through my first listen right now (haven't even finished it and he gets 5 stars, that's really good!) I can't comment on too many specific songs, but ""Love Is All I Need"" is a truly spectacular song.This is another one of those artists that experiencing will far outweigh simple words."
3,not the exact scent,"From what I understand, Escada no longer makes this product so I bought two bottles. The scent is a close match to the perfume or lotion, but not exact. It does complement the smell of the lotion though."
5,Peanutty goodness in every bite!,"These tasty bars are like the healthy version of Planters peanut bars--they are so yummy! A really satisfying snack, with just the right mixture sweet/salty goodness."
4,It May Do Your Soul Some Good,"Given that The Andy Statman Quartet comprises Statman on clarinet and mandolin, Bruce Barth on piano, Scott Lee on acoustic bass, and Bob Weiner on drums and percussion, you might be wondering why this was released on Sony Classical. The tunes played on this CD were written by Statman, by rabbis, or are traditional tunes arranged by Statman. And these are not Klezmer tunes, these are serious pieces on religious themes. That does not mean they are straightlaced and dour, though; indeed, they are quite musically enjoyable. This is not the kind of music you are very likely going or hear on the radio, alas, so if you are curious about how such music sounds, you are probably going to have to go out (or just sit in your easy chair and purchase it via the worldwide web, but you really ought to get out and get some fresh air and a little exercise walking to and from the car) and purchase this CD. It may do your soul (and body, if you get out) some good."
4,Pleasant and peaceful tunes,"Ive purchased Statman and Grisman, so I thought I would try The Hidden Light. It is quiet and easy to listen to - mostly Jewish and Russian tunes with clarinet and other instruments. I like Songs of Our Fathers, the Statman-Grisman CD better because Im partial to mandolin and acoustic and it's a little more upbeat. If youre a Statman fan, want something mellow, then you will be pleased with Hidden Light."
3,I'm not the only one with Mixed Emotions,"Yes, a line from a Rolling Stones song best describes my feelings about this compilation. The good news is that this disc will introduce a new generation of fans to the classic Herb/TJB sound, and for this it's hard not to be grateful. The bad news is that so many best selling albums from Mr. Alpert and the Brass are missing in action. Some went out of print quickly after brief availabilty on CD. Others are being phased out as we speak! (WHIPPED CREAM/LONELY BULL/GREATEST HITS). We need a complete reissue of the Alpert catalog. Soon, please."
4,Still Sounds Great ! ! !,"Anyone who was around for the Tijuana Brass era will love their contribution to this CD. However.....you have to be a jazz fan (which I am) to enjoy the 2nd portion of this CD. The differences are almost contradictory. The A&M ""Classics, Vol 1"" would be perfect for the casual fan. Of course, the remastered version is better quality than ""Classics."""
5,Herb Alpert & The Tijuana Brass,"I grew up on this music as a kid and had it on an LP Album. So when I found all this great music on a CD, I just had to have it. It has all the great instrumental trumpit & brass music by Herb Alpert & The Tijuana BrassDefinitive Hitsplus 7 songs by Herb Alpert himself. If you like this kind of music you will love this CD. So glad when I found this that I had to have it right away."
5,"Top Trumpeter, Top Album","I think that this album, Definitive Hits, is absolutely awsome! The trumpeter is great. He has a clear, light tonguing, and the music varies from both older styles and modern music. I reckon that this is a great album to buy. Herb Alpert is a GREAT trumpeter, and the Tijuana Brass do a great job too!"
4,A lot of gold in this brass,"Great horn work. Very diverse song lineup. I found at least three I really like--Rise, Rotation, and Route 101, but there are plenty of others that make me smile, too."
4,The 'Kenny G' of the Trumpet,"I bought this CD to relive the memories of the music I grew up listening to in the mid/late-1970s, not too long after I was born. As the title for my review here implies, Herb Alpert is the Kenny G of the Trumpet! I am especially a fan of both ""A Taste of Honey"", ""Mexican Shuffle"", and ""Route 101"". In addition, at one time ""A Taste of Honey"" served as the opening theme music for a local morning AM Radio talk show in Hot Springs, AR, which I once used to listen to on a regular basis. Anyway, this CD for the most part is a good buy for those of you who like Spanish-style pop Trumpet music.Rock On.Russell L. SmithMena, AR"
4,Why Pay These Prices?,"There's an old saying about a fool and his/her money. Why get ripped off when there's a very good chance you can buy many of the same songs by the same artist (though NOT identified as such) for a dollar or less. I paid 49 cents for my copy. How? Look through the cut out bins for a CD entitled ""South of the Border"" by wink, wink, ""The Enrico Serenade"". This CD will be on the Compose label (No. 9041-2). It was recorded in 1990 and, it just happens to contain songs like South of the Border, Tijuana Taxi, Blue Spanish Eyes, the Spanish Flea, A Taste of Honey, Meixcan Shuffle and a few others that will sound strangely familiar if you're a Herb Alpert fan.Of course, the H. A. name will not appear on your CD. But,what do you expect a buck?"
5,"If you like great music, this should be in your collection",I like all kinds of music and every genre has its bests. Herb Alpert is one of the best. Most of the songs are instrumentals and if you are not a fan of instrumentals you would do yourself a disservice if you skipped this. The trumpets are the vocals but to say that the songs are just about the trumpets does not take in to consideration the complexity of the arrangements.This is great music for young and old and you should be playing this for your kids from the day they are born to create the synapses they will use the rest of their life. Herb Alpert should be in the collection of every true music fan.
5,Definitive Hits is the best album ever,"I love this album. It keeps me relaxed, and stress free after working hard at work."
4,Herb Alpert - the king of old hits,"This album shows the best of mr. Alpert from '62 until '87. Join the metamorphosis! Feel the moody trumpet lines! Remember the old, old hits. Understand why. Cry."
5,Love Herb Alpert,I started collecting Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass on vinyl when they first hit the music scene. I even have some on the old 4 track & 8 track tapes. I love this CD because it combines some TJB hits as well as some of Herb's solo hits.
4,great cd,i was looking for a sog that janet jackson had added background vocals to. i didn't think herb alpert had so many other great songs. i'm glad i purchased this cd!!
3,Good and not so good,"In a bout of retro craze I bought this CD. The first 13 tracks deliver the goods, but the 7 last ones are totally incompatible with the other tracks, and indeed not retro, nor even Latin. They're pop tripe, in fact. I would rather have had more of the older tracks (""Flamenco"", for example), or for all I care just those first 13 tracks on a shorter (and possibly cheaper) CD."
3,Definitive Hits versus Greatest Hits,"I tend to believe a couple of the three-star reviews on this one, and I will therefore use ""Greatest Hits"" for the hits provided on that CD and use ""Definitive Hits"" for other hits. I had hoped that I could choose between the two CDs and thus reduce my CD collection.The TJB ""Greatest Hits"" CD (CD 3267) has 7 tunes that charted on the Billboard 100. That's out of a measly 12 tunes total on that CD.This ""Definitive Hits"" CD (069 490 886-2) has 16 tunes that charted on the Billboard 100. That's out of 20 tunes total on this CD. And ""Definitive Hits"" includes all of the charted tunes which are included on ""Greatest Hits"".Unfortunately, between the two CDs, only 16 out of 40 charted tunes are included. For me, ""Definitive Hits"" should have been a two CD set with all of the 40 charted tunes. On any ""best of"" album, I look for as many tunes as I can find that individually charted on the Billboard 100. This seems to be the best way to build a library for deejay play."
4,remember,I only bought it for two songs but after playing the cd for a couple of times I really found it relaxing especially whilst driving.
3,"Like First Half, Disliked Second","Your view of this CD will be based upon your musical tastes. The first half pleased me -- it consists of the hits we associate with Herb Alpert and his sort of kicked-up Mariachi band, the hits that defined Herb Alpert. The second part consists of their attempts at popular (almost heavy) rock.This is strictly a matter of taste, so I am presenting my opinion."
2,"What's With ""The Lonely Bull""?","This would be a 4-star album, except that ""The Lonely Bull"" is in mono. The notes with this say the multi-track tape of ""The Lonely Bull"" single was lost, hence the ""enhanced monaural"". I'd be more convinced this was the best we could get were it not for the fact that I have the CD of the Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass ""Greatest Hits"" album (A&M CD-3267), and ""The Lonely Bull"" is in stereo there -- sounding worlds better and clearer than it does here. That stereo mix could have been used ""as is"" and been better than this album's muddy, if ""enhanced"", mono."
3,herp alpert hits,"if you are a big fan of his you will like this album, i only bought it for the janet jackson track"
2,"Enough of the ""HITS"" already!","I don't mean to be cranky, but this CD disappointed me personally. I've been longing to see Herb's 80's work on CD - they contain some amazing music. With the recent re-release of ""RISE"", I'm anticipating other titles from the 80's like, ""Magic Man"", ""Fandango"", ""Blow Your Own Horn"", ""Wild Romance"", etc. This stuff is as Definitive as it gets!"
3,It's Pretty Good,This was a pretty good selection. The only flaw is that the CD was not remastered so the sound is not of the highest quality.
1,Read Her Instead,"This lecture is horribly boring. I recommend instead that you read her autobiography, The Life of Saint Teresa of Avila by Herself, if you are interested in the layers that a life of prayer will take you through."
1,it's a scam,"it will not work in my Windows XP. I have repeatedly asked for help;no one answers. Finally, I was told to look it up on a databank. If you have nothing but time on your hands maybe this is for you...but if you work for a living, you've been had by this company Encoreusa."
5,Better than the original,"Fit perfectly, hinge works better than the old one. Couldn't ask for a better replacementShipped on time and arrived within 2 days."
1,Buyer beware!,"The product description for the Tiagra ST-4500 is NOT Accurate. It says, ""works with double or triple cranks"". WRONG! The ST-4500 shifter set is ONLY for double cranks. You need the ST-4503 shifter set for triple cranks. Whoever wrote the product description needs to do some research."
1,What is it,"Please clarify what this product is.Title says right shifter which would be the 9spd rear.In product decription it says left shifter which would be the front rings.Which is it? Or is it both? And if it is the front, is it for double only or can it handle triple?"
2,Other reviewer is right. Shimano's web site is wrong.,"My apology. I believed Shimano but I've subsequently seen the triples and they do have the other number. Likewise, Shimano's web site doesn't show a 105 triple and yet there apparently is one."
4,"Skua September (from the Icerigger trilogy), saves Flinx","The End Of The Matter picks up just after where Orphan Star leaves off. Flinx, now owner of a space ship, returns to Moth to continue his search for his lineage. After a few of those events that Flinx always finds himself in the middle of, he ends up with a new pet, a strange alien named Ab. Flinx, Ab and Pip then head off to another world in search of a man who bid on Flinx when he was a child slave. That man, Skua September (fresh from the Icerigger trilogy), saves Flinx just in time for his friend Tse-Mallory and Tru to show up in search of Ab (of all things, amazing coincidence). At any rate, it gets a little far-fetched as Ab eventually saves several populated planets from being sucked into a black hole (of sorts). Still, this is solid SciFi adventure and worth a read as part of the larger Flinx series."
5,love pip and flinx,I've read about every book of this series how about some new ones would love to read hem again that's why I have them on kindle but a few new adventures would be appriceated
5,Excellent for my 2yo daughter,I am using this devotional book with my 2 year old daughter. I love the little songs and poems in the book. It is great and interactive. It basically has a short (very short) simple verse for each day with a cute poem or activity followed by a tiny prayer. It also includes a note to the parent for each day to reinforce the concepts.
5,Great part two,"Cliche though it may be, Crusade of Ashes really does start with a bang and doesn't let up, all the way to its end. Like the corebook, Orpheus manages to cover all the bases, giving so many opportunites for story hooks that you actually feel more liberated than constrained by the recommended storyline.This is very much like an Orpheus Players' Guide with Merits/Flaws, rules on Artifact creation and help on how to play an Orpheus operative on the run, except that it also provides new Antagonists, Allies, and story development. The new Spectre types presented, especially the ""Friendly Angels"" are spectacularly chilling.The only problem I had with it is that it stopped too soon, much like only getting to see the first half-hour of a truly great movie. I can't wait to see where Orpheus leads."
2,NOT FULL METAL AT ALL,"I purchased this gun about a week ago and it was not what we expected. It is definately NOT full metal, it is mostly black plastic and it just feels flimsy. If I would have know, I wouldn't have bought it."
5,freaken awsome !!!!!,It was ALOT stronger than I thought. The shipping was fast and when I got it was in great quality. It is a great gun. Very reliable. And for the price this is a DEAL!! get this gun you won't regret it.
3,Some Problems,"I own this same weapon it was the same price, same body, same metal, same everything except it was sold from another distributor and was a wood colour.It's a great gun if you want a cheap but okay gun, but beware. Mine suddenly decided to randomly mis align gears after charging once.I had it for three days, charged it one day, put battery back in fired and the sound was significantly different. I opened up the gearbox and a gear is out of line, plus I can no longer use the mode selector because the plastic piece for the mode selector inside next to the gearbox split and it is very hard to place the mode selector perfectly back."
5,Airsoft metal electric AK,"Good service, good product, amazing price for an all metal AK-47! Charge the battery overnight and it is ready to go. I don't actually shoot BBs with this but love the sound and look of it. Not sure it would hold up in mock combat, but I did the real thing and have no interest in re-enactments."
1,Mine was broken out of the box.....,"This wasn't a good gun. the first time I tried to use it, the gun wouldn't shoot the bbs. If you want an AK47, get it from a different brand..."
3,Wasn't a hardcover but story is good,"This book was advertised as a hardcover, but was a worn paperback. Otherwise, the story itself is a very unique and interesting one."
5,Dr. Nina Price,"This is a true story about my family physician when I was a child. Dr. Nina Price was a most wonderful doctor and a great person. She is very well known for wearing the most unique hats while practicing medicine. She would often make home visits because many patients did not have a car to bring family members who were sick to her office. She also distributed medication to patients who did not have the resources to pay for prescriptions. She overcame many obstacles during her years while becoming a doctor. She even stared down a panther when she was a child. This is great reading. Unfortunately, this book is difficult to obtain now, but if you can find it, you will enjoy reading all about Dr. Nina Price."
5,Good stuff,"As a 25 year migraine sufferer, I have tried it all. After a month of using Petadolex my headache frequency and intensity both declined. It took about 60 days for the full effect to take hold; when I am not taking the product I typically get 2 migraines per week. When I take it consistently the headaches are reduced to 3 per month. My presciption medication such as Imitrex and phenergan are also much reduced."
4,A miracle: no side effects!,"After years of experimenting with prescription drugs (both affordable and astronomically-priced ones), I was sick of the various side effects and decided to go off the pharmaceuticals and stick with my daily vitamins. My neurologist said I could kick Big Pharma if I took Petadolex three times a day. So far, so good: lots of energy (a new thing in the last couple of years!) and my headache frequency is down, but I can't say for sure it's because of the Petadolex. I'll get back to you.**But why the huge price jump? Last month when I ordered it was just under $25. Now it's $33 and change. Not cute."
3,"3 stars to the CD, 5 starst to MLF!!!!!","Try to do this: listen to all the songs of this album with careful. Pay VERY attention to Michael lee firkins hand. THIS MAS HAS STYLE!!!! When all the other are trying to put fire in their fretboards, Michael is producing the most sweety and clean melodies with his unique fingerstyle technique. I must say say this again. HE IS THE MAN! It worths US$32 only to hear he playing with Steve Morse in a Weather Report song.Be aware Petrucci fans...MLF will win this battle with his fingers only !... forget about the picks!"
4,Technology meets Tradition,"When it comes to what's been widely described as the ""Asian Massive"" genre, the measure of an artist's success has been his or her ability to deliver the ""East meets West"" sound. Scores of U.S. and U.K.-bred asians have worked hard at capturing this sound. The Punditz are unique in that this Delhi-based duo's approach finds a graceful balance between technology and tradition. With ""Midival Times"", the Punditz have clearly mastered this approach. The album does a masterful job of integrating deeply tradional sounds and vocals with technologically savvy music production that only a set of G4 powerbooks can produce. Delhi swings baby, Delhi swings!"
2,Really didn't like this at all,"Even though I listened to samples and thought I would like this, I didn't. Most cuts sound just like the one before and the one after. You've got to REALLY love Indian electronica to like this CD. If you're not sure if you like Indian electronica, then skip it, or just download a couple of selections rather than spring for the whole CD."
4,"Great. Not as good as their first, but great!","Midival Punditz's first album was one of those seed albums that grew, flourished, and inspired many other artists and fans. It was obviously not without its own roots, but it did take on new directions and experimental forms.This album (their second) was more self aware, more polished, and in the end a little less daring. They moved on from complex drum patterns and produced tracks you would hear more often in night clubs and the mainstream. That's great for them and their evolution as artists, but not so much for a fan who fell in love with their original form."
2,Don't waste your money,"A few words of advice: Do not buy this game. If you so badly need to play it, I suggest renting it. I had high hopes. I paid $50 for the game. $50 for an hour of mild entertainment. When I realized I had beat the game after only an hour I was highly disappointed. I'm not a big fan of fighting games (if you can even call this a fighting game), so for me to beat the game in an hour was simply amazing. Someone more into fighting games could probably beat the game in a half hour. It's that easy and short. You'd think they could have done better..."
1,NO LO COMPRES!!,"No sirve, muy corto se termina muy rapido, so easy and so so short. half hour is enoght to finish it."
1,Feline Greenies,"Consumers Beware of these and all treats for pets that contain the toxic ingredient,Menadione Sodium Bisulfite {MSB}. It is a synthetic form of Vitamin K 3. It will hurt your pet big time. It is in almost All pet treats. Look at the product ingredients Before buying any treats. This is a man made form of vit. k3 and causes cancer,kidney problems,lung problems,liver problems,and mucous membrane problems. Prolonged exposure can produce target organ damage. Do not use! Also, Check the canned and dry foods you are feeding your pets. If you see BHA,BHS,BY products, etc, Don't BUY !"
1,"My cat choked on these, more than once.","I can't recommend these simply because I feel that they might be a bit on the dangerous side. My cat loved the flavor of these, but had a problem with the size and choked up a single piece on more than one occasion. If you search on Greenies and choke you'll see that others have experienced this issue with Greenies. The best treats I've found are the All Natural Temptations, any flavor."
4,My cat loves these!,"My vet recommended getting Greenies because they are supposed to help cats with their dental health. I bought a pack to supplement my 18month old tabbys diet. At first she refused to eat them. She would just leave htem in her bowl. Then I started mixing in with her regular kibble and she would just eat around them. Then one day she decided they were her favorite food. Then she decided she wasn't going to eat anything else. She basically loved these so much we had to stop giving them to her because she refused to eat her regular kibble. Now we have to be more dilligent about brushing her teeth. If you've never brushed a cats teeth, consider yourself lucky (or unlucky if your cat has had dental problems that could have been prevented by brushing). She hates us for taking away her favorite treat and absolutely despises us when we have to brush her teeth. I highly recommend but if your cat is a diva like mine is you way run into some problems."
5,It seems to work..,"I was told that my male cat needed tooth work next year(2013). I went on line and found C.E.T. but as it happens my female is the only one that likes them. Then I found that Greenies were good for teeth and the male loves them. Of course it was exposed that the Greenies didn't have enzymes, ammino acids, Lactase inhibitors and stem cells. I still gave the male 6-8 Greenies a day. Now I looked at his teeth at the start and the gums were red, now I see a pinkish color. I give them dry food in the morning and their teeth didn't seem to change. I have to conclude that the Greenies are doing something to make the gums better."
5,Yummy,"On my last visit to the vet, I found out that my cat has tarter on her teeth! I purchased these because the package says that they are a dental treat. I'm not sure how much it has helped with the tarter(though my cats gums are not so red anymore), but all of my cats come running when it is treat time. They love these treats! This is the brand I will be purchasing for now on."
5,Great reference source,Many recipes and pictures to see your finished product. A must for beginners.
4,Inexpensive and it works,My setup has the wireless router on the ground floor and two machines upstairs. One machine directly above the router worked fine but another that was about 20' away worked poorly. Tried the antenna on the router and it really didn't help. Then I tried this antenna on the most distant PC and the improvement was incredible.
3,Helped some but is it worth the cost?,"The exterior antenna did help as it got the antenna out from behind a cabinet. It did improve the signal strength for that reason, but I'll bet there are cheaper ones that work just as well."
1,Worst toy I have ever purchased,"This was a big waste of time and money. My grandson laughed at me for buying such a worthless model airplane. Should have run the money through my shredder would have a lot more fun. Why does your company sell such product. Will never purchase anything from you again,"
3,A compendium of kitchen utensils,"...but you probably guessed that from the title. The lists are organized by type (serving dishes, drinking vessels, cutlery) and each term has a definition, documented variant spellings with sources, and the earliest known citation. Some pictures, too. So you can find out such vital information, for example, that a ""pottle"" dates to 1300 and is a liquid measure equal to two quarts, and was variously spelled potel, potell, potelle, pottel, and pottell. Useful for those who do not have access to the Oxford English Dictionary."
2,"Over-the-Top Villain, TSTL Heroine","The action in this novel was exciting -- but that alone doesn't make a good novel. Corny and melodramatic writing can be fun at first, but it wears thin. Especially if you add a heroine who keeps doing stupid things. Not to mention subplots that fizzle out.The only character I remember strongly is the villain. He could have been a fun character, but he became too eeeevil to be believed. He even goes so far as to kick a dog, much like the villain from an old movie!At All About Romance, I gave this book a D+."
5,Dark Emerald,Always entertaining and can't wait to pick it back up to read more. She can always pull me into her stories.
1,One Mayhap over the line?,"I could not finish this silly novel. At first I found it amusing that in order to add some period tone to the book the author used the word ""mayhap"". A lot, over and over it shows up. It is so much of a distraction, that instead of enjoying the story, I found myself waiting for the next ""mayhap"". There is not much of a wait. The author must use ""mayhap"" on almost every page. I finally tossed the book in disgust, unable to finish. ""Mayhap"" the author should find a few different words.Also a jennet is a donkey, not a horse!"
5,Very nice doodlepad,I bought this for my daughter for car rides since she loves coloring lately. I couldn't comfortably cart around the giant Melissa & Doug coloring book in a vehicle. So it's just perfect for some doodling and entertainment on the go.
3,It's just a small notepad!,"I should have read the reviews before buying this product. I thought this was a large doodle pad for kids, well it's not. It's really a small notepad with M&D printed on it. Wouldn't have bought it had I known the size."
2,"Good doodle pad, but very small","I guess I should of looked at the dimensions of this pad, because it's rather small, but still a good value for something to just doodle on."
1,I paid $4.25 for this?!,"This is a scratch pad. You can buy them in bulk at Office Max. Given the price, I expected a large 9 x 12 pad (clearly I was in a hurry or I'd have read the dimensions).Don't bother. Even $2 is overpriced."
5,paint test pad,This pad actually works great for testing airbrush intensity and color. I always have one with me when I'm airbrushing now.
3,good enough,This is simple white paper to draw by kids. Not for high expectation but reasonable price is fine. My kids enjoyed it.
3,"""Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence.""","Disapointed love turns Paul from a hard-working idealist to a cagey brown-noser on the make. Can defending his one-armed, dipso buddy realign his priorities in a town where straight-laced bluebloods call the shots? Find out in this slick, but not overaught 50s melodrama. Robert Vaughn as the disapated playboy is very good and Paul gives an energetic performance -- in the courtroom scenes it's fun to imagine you're watching the young Frances X. Galvin before his fall. (And just try to watch his climactic courtroom takedown of Richard Deacon with a straight face.) There's a fun academic commentary as well."
5,Fascinating Journey,This is a great book. I would reccomend it to anyone whom lives with FASD.Full of information.
5,Best FAS/FAE book on the market,"Where do I start? When I first received this book, out of habit I started to highlight the important areas, as they related to me, and my family. After about 30 pages, I looked back to see that EVERYTHING was highlighted. No FAS book has been able to pin point my son to the T, as this book. While reading, I felt for the first time, that someone understood what it is really like. My family and I can now see into the future for our son. Befor this book arrived my days/and his were hopeless. No longer am I crying myself to sleep, or regreating our wonderful adoption. MY SON HAS FETAL ALCOHOL SYNDROME, AND I WILL SURVIVE!!!! Thank you Jodee for taking the time out to write such a perfect book. We will forever be grateful to you and your family."
4,Decent Introduction to drawing,"This book is very similar to Betty Edwards ""Drawing on the right side of the brain"". It starts off nicely with contour drawing, and provided that you do all the excercises, you should vastly improve your drawing skills after completing this book.I would recommend it to people who can't stand the psychobable of Dr B.Edwards."
5,Clear & Concise,"An easy to follow, step-by-step instruction on realistic drawing that includes a variety of mediums. As the title states this book is a intended for the raw beginner. Other books such as Betty Edwards ""Drawing on the Right Side of Brain"" contain similar lessons, but this one ""clicked"" with me. No drawing book will be all things to all people, but this volume is certainly a good place to start. I can also recommend ""Drawing for Older Children & Teens"" by Mona Brooks, these titles compliment each other nicely."
5,Very nice introduction to drawing,"I've read several books on drawing aimed at beginners recently (Drawing on the right side of the brain, Keys to Drawing, Drawing for Dummies), and this is the one I would recommend to beginners looking for a step-by-step introduction for true beginners. It is concise, contains numerous illustrations, has a wealth of worthwhile exercises, and minimizes tangents and philosophical rambling. If you want to learn to draw, this book will help you make a good start toward that goal."
3,Wasn't what I expected,I wanted a very simple beginner book and this is much more advanced than I wanted. Not what I was looking for
2,"It's not you, it's me.","Approach this book like a college class in drawing, and you will probably learn a lot from it. I bought this book to go through with my 11 year old daughter, and neither of us could stick with it. I wanted to, but it just wasn't engaging. If you buy this, I would suggest setting goals for yourself, like completing one chapter every 3 days. I wanted to learn to draw, but I didn't feel compelled to continue after the first couple of chapters.If you have a burning desire to draw, or feel like you have some natural drawing ability, give this a try. If you are like me, and want to be pulled into a skill, look elsewhere.To be fair, I've tries several other books on learning to draw, and I haven't found anything that has led to any success."
2,Boring and Graphics SUCK!,I love tycoon games and even catch myself buying any game with the word tycoon in the title. I being in law enforcement thought Prison Tycoon would be kind of fun but was dead wrong. It takes WAY too long to get prisoners and i seemed to be sitting around staring at the screen with nothing going on in the game for large amounts of time. The game had a huge lack of things to do and options to play. In sandbox mode you only have a choice of three locations with a select few number of buildings to choose from. This game is just really REALLY boring and really slow!
1,WOW (NOT),"What a horiable game!!!! No Tutortial, no real point to it. I felt it was a waste of money. Save your money and get a better game than this!"
1,Lots of bugs - gameplay is basically broken,"I love simulation games of all types and thought the premise of Prison Tycoon II sounded really fun. Unfortunately, the game has so many bugs that I was never able to enjoy it. Prisoners walked through brick walls, guards wandered aimlessly without interacting with anything or anyone, etc. I've installed all available patches, but it looks like the programming is just broken. It's a shame - if the company had gotten the game to actually work before releasing it, I think it would have been a lot of fun."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"I like the sims games, but this is the worst. The game plays itself. I tried to get prisoners to come to the jail for two hours until I became so frustrated that I had to search how to online. You have to pull them off the bus with your mouse. The guards beat up the inmates for no reason, the inmates walk around aimlessly, when a prisoner escapes the guard just stands there and watches. I couldnt get past the beginning of the game. When you first start it gives you a limited amount of money, which isnt nearly enough for the buildings and stuff you need. So, you will run out of money quickly and there is no money cheat for this game. Basically you buy two buildings, buy the stuff to put in them, and thats it. Then you have to sit and stare at the screen aimlessy for a really long time (about 1/2 hour to an hour at a time) doing nothing while your money goes back up so you can continue. NOT WORTH THE BUY!!!"
2,Joke,"Doesn't work . Used the whole bottle, followed directions, no results do not waste your time or money. Not what I expected"
2,Better than good chocolate?...No!,"This was a weird one...The story line was great, the characters were great, but Viehl didn't do either of them any good. If Keynon, Kole or Moning had written ""If Angels Burn"" it would have been a must read! And I'll answer the responses to my review before hand...""If you love Kenyon, Cole and Moning so much why don't you just read them?"" A: Because I've read them all and have been hoping beyond hope to find something else along those lines to enjoy...No luck with that though."
3,"If you like Anne Rice, then this book will probably be right down your alley","I, on the other hand am not the biggest Anne Rice fan. Both the books in this series are set in such a way where the author hops from each of the character's perspectives constantly. You go from the main character, to the main character's brother, to mr. french vampire/reason you're reading this novel probably character and so on and so forth. The book is most definately not bad by all means, but I found my interests wandering off and on when the author skipped around to parts of the book that were by all means integral to the storyline, but not all that interesting to have to read.Overall if you're desperate for a book to read involving vampires, go ahead and get this book. But if you haven't read the Anita Blake series (Up to book 7 or so) go read that instead."
1,Not what I expected,"I will not go into the story plot, as that has been reviewed before. I did not like the book, found the heroine annoyingly negative and whiny throught the story. I did not think the characters were very well developed and had no empathy to Alex or Cyprian. Their love story didn't ring sincere. And although this is a paranormal, I was under the impression that it was also romance since I purchased it in the romance section of the bookstore.On a personal note, the frequent negative inuendo of faith (ie christianity), as evil was a detractant for me."
3,Super Reader,"Yes, it seems vampires get sloppy with their spelling over the centuries to come up with a silly name for themselves.A plastic surgeon is tapped by one of them to help out in the way plastic surgeons do, for someone that is in a bad way.Female doctor, male head vampire, biting, bleeding, eventual shagging, you get the picture.Doctor thinks the whole condition, after she gets it, might be some sort of disease, not the 'we are bad and got cursed' mindset that they have.There is also a group of priests dedicated to fighting the fangers, but they don't seem to have much luck, and their history is apparently a bit of a fib as the vamps were the Templars, not them!A bit of slaughtering happens.A fairly average vampire novel, lighter on the mushy mushy than some, and Viehl calls a spade a shovel in that respect, not a 'manly digging implement'."
4,Good introduction,"No, the book wasn't perfect, but it will peak your interest. I'm not into Vampire series' - I am the romantic suspense queen - so for me to say this is a good start says something.Give it a try. Remember: This is the first book in the series. You're not going to know everything. After all, why have a series if you solve everything in the first book?I agree that Keller and Cyprien don't exactly sizzle, but there is something there and I hope we see it develop."
2,Somewhat entertaining,"With nothing else to read at the moment, and looking for something new, I tried this book. It is ok. It has an interesting take into the vampire world, but I could foresee most of the plot twists before they happened. I had gone ahead and ordered the first two books and read them. I will not continue right now. Maybe if I get bored enough I'll see it through."
2,Just average,"Bottom Line: Try before you buyOne of the quotes on the book cover, stated it was 'Erotic'. I didn't find it erotic at all.It wasn't a great idea for a story. The whole thing where the main character is kept (so to speak) in order to perform surgery on a vampire's face...seemed well, not that interesting. It did not captivate my attention.It was sort of a ho-hum read...nothing horrible, nothing fantastic. It certainly didn't make me want to read the rest of the series.J.R. Ward is much more interesting, and erotic."
1,major disappointment!,"This book was a major disappointment. I didn't care about any of the characters. Everyone seemed so unlikable. A major waste of time. J. R. Ward's books, to name one, are far superior. The same gritty material but done with a much more deft touch."
4,Great new vampire series...,"I have to tell you that this is a wonderful addition to the vampire genre. While it may not be sexy enough to rate highly as a romance novel, the world that is created is both compelling and complex. I found the characters be be intriguing and complicated, and the female protagonist, Alex, is a hoot. She is so irreverent about the whole Darkyn culture; there are lots of sassy females in vampire lit, but she takes it to another level. I'm not sure what's wrong with a professional woman saying, ""Bite my ass""; I thought it, and pretty much everything else she said in the book, hysterical. I hope this is a long and successful series. Hooked me!"
2,should have stuck with the short story,"I am a fan of Lynn Viehl's other work (writing under other names), but feel she missed the mark on this one. The basic plot line of ""If Angels Burn"" was originally a short story written by Ms. Viehl for her fans' pleasure while she was in between books.It was an excellent short story that didn't end with the heroine suddenly falling into the arms of her patient cum vampire. The sequel, another short story, took care of her resentment issues and brought them together in a believable manner. Those stories were well crafted. I enjoyed them and am disappointed that, I assume because of the publication of this weak adaptation, I can't find any of those wonderful short stories online anymore. Sad - a weak vampire romance traded for a collection of well crafted tales of original worlds and species."
5,"Welcome to ""Darkyn""","""If Angels Burn"" is the first novel in what promises to be another outstanding ""Vampire"" series. Lynn Veihl has given fully fleshed characters, sometimes sympathetic, sometimes not but believable.Dr Alexandra Keller is a reconstructive surgeon called on to operate on what must be her most unusual case.Michael Cyprien will be her most intriging patient.The story grabs you from the beginning and yet still picks up the pace as it slams towards the end of the book and throws a curve right near the end!....then leads into the next book.If you like well constructed stories and characters, please read this book.Well done, bring on the rest of the series!"
2,Disappointing,"Since I'm on this new vampire kick, I was totally prepared to embrace this series (especially since the cover doesn't have some half-naked couple entertwined...NOTE TO PUBLISHERS: it'd be nice to be able to read some of these books in public without providing nearby children with a free sex-ed class) but was let down. The characters just sort of tumble together with no real foundation and new characters are randomly tossed in.All-in-all, not among the absolute worst reads I've had lately. I'd say if your desperate for something to read and can find a used copy for $1 or so, it may be worth it."
1,One star is generous for this book!!!,"This has got to be the worst book I ever read. I didn't think there is a fiction book that I would not like, well I met it. If you like dark and twisted this is the book for you. The author makes no attempt to make the characters lovable to the reader. I don't even think they connect with each other. Horribly written."
3,dissappointed,"This book had a lot of promise, but just didn't pan out. The writing was tight and the dialogue was usually crisp and fun. But the story had too many complicated sub-plots and a vampire who didn't have a lick of charisma. Alex, the capable surgeon who has been 'infected' by the the vampire's blood/bit, rightly despises him, then suddenly loves him (when he's at his most obnoxious, I might add). I recommend you try JR Ward, or Kim Harrison's series' instead."
4,Great Story,"I loved the Story on Alex and Michael, and would have given 5 stars just on that, but I hated the chapters on the Breathen and her brother, and practically skipped that bit."
4,Truly interesting.....,The book starts off rather slow but quickly picks up and is soon charging ahead at full speed. This author has a very interesting and certainly unique concept of vampirism different than any other author I have come across. I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to any vampire loving fans. The second book was even better than the first and I really cannot wait to read the third.
4,If Angels Burn by Lynn Viehl,"What a fantastic read!! I loved this book, it was original, pacy and very sexy. The vampire mythology was interesting and believable and the vampires were as mysterious and gorgeous as they should be. Its nice to see the supernatural lifted up out of the trashy stuff and once again given a bit of class. I didn't give it five stars because I though that it ended a bit suddenly and I would have liked to have spent more time with the characters once the crisis was over. I think we will be meeting the characters again in later books-Hurrah!!! I would reccomend this book for anyone who enjoys the vampire genre and books of a supernatural slant."
3,Needs a New Cameraman,"I love travel shows and have all of Rick Steves' videos and many of Rudy Maxa's. Although I prefer Mr. Maxa's shows (they have a certain elegance and don't get bogged down in museum after museum like Rick Steves' videos), too many scenes in every show are overexposed and washed out, and sometimes the color balance is off. I have never witnessed any of this in Rick Steves' productions. I like Mr. Maxa a lot, but for Pete's sake get a new cameraman already!"
1,Crappy product,"This air mattress is a piece of junk! I din't even have it for a full week and it started to leak on me. I would inflate it in the evening, and by midnight my [...] would be touching the floor. I can't find the leak, but for it to leak after only one week is ridiculous! I would not suggest anyone buy this product. [...] I'd return it, but it'd take more money to return it, and I lose out either way."
4,Airbed,"I bought this air mattress for my 7 year old and I to use until our furniture could be moved to our new house. It's been almost a month now and I'm satisfied with this product. I love that it inflates so quickly and easily. I had a twin air mattress in the past that had a separate battery pump. What a pain it was to look for the pump, keep batteries on hand and wait for the bed to inflate. With just a flick of a switch this bed starts inflating. I haven't quite gotten the hang of how to put the cord back into the cord compartment quickly, but that is a very minor issue. Great value for the price!"
2,Warning! Danger! Not what you're expecting!!,"This is a Dutch (I think) reissue of the Capitol LP ""Jukin'"". This is the first Manhattan Transfer line-up that featured Tim Hauser & Gene Pistilli (and NOT Janis Siegel, Alan Paul ot Cheryl Bentyne)."
1,"Rating for deception, not music","Please forgive me for the one star, but people need to be warned that this CD is a gross copyright violation!! This is a European repackaging of the album Jukin'. Yes, it does feature Tim Hauser with a group called Manhattan Transfer, but it is NOT the group mentioned on the CD cover. Worse yet, it lacks the proper credit which Gene Pistilli, Marty Nelson, Pat Rosalia, and Erin Dickens rightly deserve. Members of the current lineup of The Manhattan Transfer were NOT involved in the repackaging of this product in any way. SHAME ON YOU AMAZON for having anything to do with this album!!!!The album Jukin' contains great music and can be found by doing a search under that name, PLEASE do not buy it in this form!"
4,"There is truth in everything if you you have eyes,see it.","This book invites you to explore possibilities that HIS-STORY does not and may not ever explore. I suggest reading this book with a mind open. I found the book very interesting in that there is knowledge and even more so connection among all people. Unfortunatly so much has been lost throughout time that we must be open to finding truth. Whether that truth is somthing we want to hear or not, believe or not. Truth is Truth. In Genisis 3 as the Garden of Eden is described, it states ""The name of the second river is Gihon:the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia"".King James Virsion."
1,total waste of money,this is the WORST book on home inspection I have read so far. total waste of money. how could you learn home inspection without seeing pictures ??? and there is absolutely NO photographs in this damn book !!!
3,A necessary addition to any Glenn Gould collection.,"Not as outrageously slow paced as expected, the actual recording is a bit of an anti-climax when one considers the mythology that has surrounded this controversial recording. Bernstein's (included) disclaimer is as much complimentary as it is critical and is certainly a fine example of his erudition. Audience coughing impedes listening enjoyment considerably, but there is a great sense of musical sincerity in GG's rendering with a not totally unsympathetic orchestra and conductor. Not in the league of Gilels' or Zimmerman's recordings, but definitely worthy of space on a serious collectors shelf."
4,Invaluable dissection,"This document is impossible to review as one would a standard studio or even a ""current"" live performance...giving it stars is like having a videotape of the 2nd Continental Congress and asked to rate Jefferson's rhetoric on a scale of one to five. Can you do anything else but start from five simply because the tape exists? Once the performance commences, you'll be reminded of Pogorelich when he works -- brilliant dissection. No one could possibly learn the piece from this document (hence, my four stars). But, as with the preamble to the Constitution, say, that videotape of an idiosyncratic Jefferson delivering the preamble would be invaluable if you already knew it."
3,Glenn Gould beats Brahms,"This live performance is legendary because of Bernstein's infamous comment on the discrepancy between his and Gould's interpretation. You can already sense Gould's eccentricity in the opening bar of this heroic D minor concerto. The unusual slow pace through out the first movement will make Brahms, a twenty-year-old man at the time when this piece is composed, a rococo. Unless you're really curious at how this concerto will be distorted by Gould, the Bachian, stay away from it."
3,not worth the money,"This is one of the worst recordings I've ever heard. It's not so much the coughing in the audience which disturbed me hearing this CD but the lacking of differentiation. In fact it is very hard to get all the details played by Gould- and if you get it it`s a baroque trill !!! Also Mr. Gould doesn't really like to play it beautifully romantic like for example Emil Gilels but just harsh and ""solid"" or harmonically. It would have been better if Mr. Bernstein and Mr. Gould would have switched their parts- this would have been amazing."
3,I was there.,"All I will say is that I was personally at this performance in 1962(?) at Carnegie Hall. When B. anounced that he and Gould couldn't agree on a single interpretation, you will hear on this CD a general laughter. I sat in the balcony and the student next to me booed. His lone voice isn't recorded but it describes my thoughts. Neither B. nor G. lived up to their performance responsibilites, which were, of course, to present a unified performance of Brahm's great work.You must decide for yourself whether the student was right. After the concert, I regreted not having booed too.John Ellis"
5,cant beleive it,my wife orders stuff from amazon[.com] ..so i thought il look around and behold they had this group the natural four ..its funny i grew up watching these cats perfect there songs as my father wrote tunes with these guys clark smith and curtis moore of oakland what a trip this is music at its best ..dwayne
4,A powerful introduction to Conrad,"This is a collection of Conrad's shorter works. Some of the stories are very powerful and moving, combining character structure, plot, and poetic language. There are only a couple of duds in the book, and even these are pretty good. Be prepared for varying levels of difficulty, though. Definitely recommended."
3,OK but Giles + PEAT = better,"I just took the 7/31/12 NPTE and passed. I bought both this book and Giles for content review. I was immediately turned off by the wordiness of each page and the lack of tables, color coordination, and images (Giles had this). I did, however, take all 3 practice tests. Generally, they are significantly more difficult compared to either Giles or PEAT but this isn't necessarily a good thing. IMO, some of the questions were long winded, wordy, and poorly worded, which made it difficult to decipher what the question was actually trying to ask. Additionally, the explanations for said questions were equally poor, sometimes giving explanations that did not appear practical or were difficult to understand. To study for the NPTE, I would recommend Giles for content review and PEAT for test exams. Giles and O Sullivan both have weaknesses in their practice tests but will do if you need more practice.-Thomas"
3,Mediocré,"Compaired to the immediate results of the Zymox shampoo, this stuff is okay. I know each pet allergy situation may vary; however I have tried this after bath, and between. It doesn't add protection, in my dogs case; for he loves to roll around in the stuff that gives him hives; grass! Zymox med shampoo, and zyrtec, or the generic brand, works fabuluosly. Zymox products are wonderful. I'm curious though, why most vets don't let you know how great they work, especially on a pet that needs relief right then."
5,Zymox Medicated Rinse,"It has stopped my dog from scratching incessently and was recommended by the groomer and vet. as a tool to relieve the constant biting and scratching. Also, it has a pleasant fragrance, not medicinal."
5,A Life Saver,"I feel inspired. Without the guilt of many religious books, Mr. Schnarr answers questions to traditional questions of spirituality. He addresses questions about life after death, God, and the Bible. I like the straightforward, matter-of-fact tone that gets right down to business. This book offers a very simple, very practical belief system for the taking, but doesn't condem anyone for not agreeing. An excellent find for anyone looking for a reason to believe."
3,its a hard pill to swallow,everything is as advertised I just thought that the pills would be smaller they are large and chaulky but you cant beat the price so if you dont have trouble swallowing go for it
5,Phenomenal Creative Insight,"This book, as well as Lloyd's other book ""Test Your Creative Thinking"" have stimulated several levels of creativity and taken my visualization skills to an all-new depth of dimension. Those interested in Lloyd's work should highly consider checking out his web-site. He has put some puzzles on there, as well. www.ahapuzzles.comThis book contains refreshingly new and and innovative/ingenuitive puzzles. These aren't your average, rehashed cliché's found in most like-minded books out there. I have owned several puzzle books in my time and none other can bear comparison to the unequivocal amount of wit and dexterity that Lloyd provides. Not only are his puzzles a bit of a mental tilt-a-whirl, but they are also *Fun*!"
5,Pure creativity!,"The puzzles contained in this book are more than simple puzzles or IQ items; they are kind of works of art, sometimes poetry; you take so much pleasure to read the solution or to discover it yourself! Totally original material.Lloyd King is a real creative person."
3,Short life expectancy,"This product is soft and comfortable however, it broke down very, very quickly. Color faded and weaving separated. I had purchased a similar product before and it held up much longer than the recent purchase. If you get one, realize you may need to bring it inside each time after you use it. It did not stand up to the elements. Personally, I far prefer to have the hammock ready and waiting rather than having to take it down and put it up each time."
4,Easy on my old body,"Yeah, that's why I got this - my wrist and elbows give me grief if I even think about going heavy, and the little bit of rotation this gives was perfect.The handles spin on two pivots, visible in the picture (left side shows pivots at 1 o'clock and 7 o'clock). It does not rotate any other place, but when you start pulling and pushing you can flip the handles around two ways for whichever motion (palm up/palm down) you're doing.It works good and smooth."
5,"Classy, Insightful -- A First-Rate Dual Bio!",This book not only takes a fresh and thoroughly readable look at two extraordinary lives -- it also includes some excellent assessments of their songs. I've read most everything published on these two men and found this book worthwhile and highly enjoyable. If only all composer bios were so intelligently handled!
5,"Shipped Quickly, Great Price","What an interesting book! So well written, interesting concept...contains lyrics, analysis of music (notation) from countless songs, lots of photos and weaves the biographies of these two emblematic artists.The Evening Standard review ""An exhilarating scholarly, copiously illustrated tribute to two men who brought priceless perfection to literacy, and the art of popular entertainment. Citron (the author),himself a composer, is at best analyzing music and lyrics: neither pretentious nor patronizing to the layman."""
1,No option to buy a single window,"It's a little frustrating when you're forced to buy two rear side windows and a back window when all you need is a rear side window. These soft windows get old and crack quite easily, especially in cold climates, and that's what happened to my window. I have already purchased a back window which also cracked a while back and now another one of the windows has cracked. Then again with how easily these windows crack maybe I really should be buying all three windows at once because they'll need replacing pretty soon as well."
1,buyer beware no curtains,"Before ordering this I contacted someone threw chat from amazon asking if this came with curtains, they said yes so I ordered one. I got the item and no curtains, I chatted with another person on amazon and they apologized and sent me another one and said they would make sure curtains were in it, got it a few days later and again no curtains. Apparently this item does not come with curtains, just the valance so buyers beware, you are just paying for a valance and the price for just a valance is ridiculous. I could see like $5 but $18? Thats crazy"
3,"A Great Recording, five stars.","I accidentally gave this a three star rating and could not change it.I am a big fan of Lee Wiley and have most of what she recorded, either on 78's, LP's or CD's. It is a shame that she was never much of a star beyond 52nd street as her singing is truly a revelation if you have not heard her before. She is, along with Mildred Bailey, one of the best white jazz singers of the 30's. Her other recordings, A Touch of The Blues and her songbooks or Manhattan are also highly recommended. Although she was nearing the end of her recording career by the time of this recording she had not lost her voice. She is sensitive and smart in her delivery. The orchestra and arrangements are top notch. A thoroughly enjoyable collection of standards.Mosaic has released this CD with two additional tracks and its cost is 15 bucks, check out their website as it is still readily available there."
1,Horrible. Why did he have to go Ricky Iglesias?,"I saw Manolin live in Havana with one of the best Cuban Timba bands ever assembled. He was right up there with La Charanga Habanera and (dare I say it) Los Van Van. Now he's defected to the US (which I can, in a way, understand) and sings meaningless, run of the mill ballads the world doesn't need.Manolin was one of the best bandleaders and arrangers Timba (Cuban Salsa for the rest of you) has ever seen. What he has never been is a great singer. Now this is all he does and the result is mediocre.If you want to hear the real Manolin, go to Timba.com or check out his masterpiece ""De Buena Fe"" here on Amazon. Simply amazing stuff."
5,Consagracion de un artista,This is the demonstration that a good artist can do whatever he wants.This is the best of the best.
3,"Short, but Not So Sweet","Project Princess is a fun, short addition to the Princess Diaries series. This books details Mia's spring break spent building homes for the less fortunate. Project Princess goes by pretty fast that by the time you get into it, the book is over. Anyone who wants to read the entire series should just read it and then move on to the later installments."
2,"A little skinny, ain't it?","All the others are awesome. I own all of them up until this book. I thought it would be a lot bigger. I mean, Princess in Waiting covered only like 3 weeks. That was like 280 pages. This book? At first glance, less than 100 pages. But is much more than that. You can learn that: Dairy Queens aren't good in NYC, The All-Evil-Once-Only-Thought-Good-Portrayed-As-Good-In-The-Movie-That-Lilly-Totally-Freaked-Out-About Grandmere can soooo save your life, and more. I got it at Borders for $3.00"
3,Let me just explain...,"This book was only originally written as a short book for the United Kingdom's national book week. Every year, successful authors write short books that will go on sale. Each schoolchild gets given a 1 book token, to be exchanged for one of these special books or for discount off of another book (to encourage reading, probably). The only reason this was released in the USA (except possibly making money) was that many USA fans were buying the 1 book from British sites and wanted to see it in American stores. So worry no more. It was a one-off British special. It was probably written in a week. So now you know. Don't let this put you off the brilliant Meg Cabot.Give it a try. It's alright actually."
3,Disappointing,"I used to love the Princess Diaries series--they were my favorite books. But after book number three, I must say I am losing interest. Meg says that she would like to follow Mia through high school, but who would want to read while Mia becomes more and more shallow and snooty. She freaks out about the simplest things, like her boyfriend not being interested in making out with her. She is becoming the epitome of the teenage stereotype--sex-crazed, arrogant, and self-centered. I have to say that the books have lost their pizazz, their charm, and their funny wit that used to make me laugh out loud. This book is an extremely fast read, mostly focusing on Mia complaining about the fact that Michael won't kiss her constantly. I admire Meg Cabot as a writer, and have enjoyed her other books such as ""Haunted"" and ""She Went All the Way."" This series, however, is getting very old very fast."
5,The misinformed spout off...again!,"First of all, this is a great book;like the other four volumes! The story is very entertaining as always, and doesn't deserve all the criticism it's been getting. I think it's great that Meg Cabot plans to write about ALL of Mia's highschool career! Another great thing is that the profit from the sales of this book are going to a worthy cause to help people; not just to the author as some seem to think. The ""Princess Diaries"" books are great and I hope there are many more to come!"
2,Not really worth buying,"This book was somewhat of a disapointment after reading the first four funny and cute novels. It had an ok plot but the story did not build up to anything. In every other book there was a climax where a large change took place involving Mia's life. This book was too short to build up to anything. The storyline did not seem to progress in the least bit. Particularly there was no development in the relation between Mia and Micheal. The characters had to face literally no challenges. All in all it is still a funny book and if tou have an hour sit down and read it, but it is not worth buying, nor is it neccessary to read in order to understand the series."
2,Lowest Rating I've Given Yet,"No offense to Meg Cabot, but this book was dissapointing... I mean, I love knowing now what Mia was talking about in book five with Michael and the hammer in the overalls deal, but this book made me look at Mia in a whole different light. Thankfully I rushed onto the 5th book and Mia went back to being her normal self. In the 4 1/2 book, she portrays herself very selfishly and I was extremely appalled by her ""I think it's easier to worry about the unidentified species that might be killing off as we speak when your inside, away from all of it.""I hear the shallow bell ringing... I mean through the whole series she talks about how she wants to save the baby seals, and join Greenpeace, and she can't handle a little bug? Where will she get in life? Oh yeah, she's a princess. As an activist in animal rights and the environment, I am extremely dissapointed that Meg Cabot portrayed an extremely influencing character so selfishly."
1,4 1/2??????????,"Why would anyone-right mind or not-release a four and a half novel? Did Cabot simply come up with the idea one night and decide to publish it right then and there? Why not simply include it with the fifth book and add some spice to the series? All in all, not a recommended buy."
2,What Happened?,"While this book had its moments (I laughed out loud twice), it didn't really live up to the other books. In the rest of the series, Mia is expressing how she wants to save the animals and campaign for the environment. Suddenly it's all about kissing her new boyfriend. In the book, she volunteers to build a house for the poor with a school program. But all she really wants is to run off with Michael every chance she gets. Where is the Mia Thermopolis we know and love? Your friend and mine has been replaced with a hormonal stereotype. A quick read, but not a worthwhile one."
4,Leaves you hungry for more,"Im a true Princess Diaries fan ever since I saw the movie, and bought all the books inlcuding Princess Lesson and Project Princess. The book was good,with Mia's witty charms but it was too short. Sure, its called 4 and 1/2, but like her books are like 250 pages or something, and this was 50 pages! Even though it was for the proceeds of a charity, Meg Cabot should have at least made it longer, like 100 pages. I mean, after waiting expectantly to what would happen to Mia for months, this book isnt exactly helpful.Next time Meg Cabot decides to write a book to raise money for charity, I suggest her to make it worth our money."
2,mia...oh my!,"this book is ugghh. The idea of helping others is good. but mia is an...i really don't want to use the word idiot but she really kinda is. i'm sorry but she is! i mean, i'm around the same age as her and i don't think about making out with guys all the time. I don't even have a boyfriend! I like the fact that she helped others; that's always a good thing. but that was just some of the plot. Most of it was ooo how soon can i make out? and that is incredibly shallow and NOT what i want to read about."
4,Project Princess,"This book was okay. Very short, easy to read. It covers what Mia is doing on her spring break and how she has a hard time adapting to the wilderness because she is a city girl.But I think she's gotta get used to it, if she wants to save the whales or whatever.But it's only fifty pages, and you should read it because after all you gotta take the good with the bad and if you loved her other novels you should try to keep up."
3,Just doesn't seem like it's worth the release,"This is a very, very, very short story. Couldn't it have been better served as part of Princess Diaries 5?"
3,Project Princess,It was good but not as good as her other books. A very quick read but I should have only paid a couple of dollars for it not 5.00.It was her same style but very short.
2,A Disappointment,I loved the Princess Diaries series and had been eagerly awaiting Project Princess. I was dissappointed after having finished it. Not that much happened during the plot of the story. It seemed as though Meg Cabot was just writing a book that fans of her other would like and buy so she could make some extra money. When her next book Princess in Pink comes out I'm not going to buy it because I feel as though my money was wasted on Project Princess. Compared to her other pieces of work this was her worst by far. Readers who have fallen in love reading about Mia in books 1-4 will be extremely dissapointed with this eventless book.
2,My Review,"I did not think THE PRINCES DIARES, VOL. 4 was that good beause there was not a lot of action or plot in the book. The book also seems to drag readers along. I think this series has gone downhill after the first book."
5,very useful and enjoyable for anyone.,"SInce this books talks about different topics, like psychologic, radio transmitters and antennas, survival, and about how to make soap from nature, anyone will find it very interesting, its easy to read, and very enjoyable for those people who want to know a little about everything."
4,Well Done,"I would like to recommend other things in addition to this book.First of all; if you would like to know something about SOF, you should start reading the US doctrine of Spec Ops. This subject is not available for civilians for a while; as far as i know...it's apprx. 1100 pages.But... you can study FM 21-75,FM 21-76 and FM 21-76-1.If you can get them...In addition i recommend FM 31-70 ""Basic Cold Weather Training""You should know that it won't be easy to find these now..But they are a valueable asset in understanding some matters.There is also an other book available:Theory of Special Operations(Case Study)This one is a must read...Not only for enlisted personnel but also for civilians. And it's easy to get this...At last i would like to attend you on the fact of philosophy and warfare.. And why a soldair should be a thinker first..If you agree with me then you should read: Gates of Fire or Tides of WarKnow that you won't find ""Gates of Fire"" nor ""Tides of War"" easy to read..."
3,Not bad!,"I have to admit, I love the pronunciation help, but cannot figure out how I am supposed to find a verb I am looking for. I understand about the 3 groups of verbs, but it's not in alphabetical order within the 3 groups. Also I wish the definitions were on the same page rather than in the back. I still like 501 French verbs better, although I was hoping I wpould like this one better."
2,Does not fit Aprilaire 760,"I bought this as a replacement for my Aprilaire model 760. I bought with a filter and the scale filter as a kit. The filter did fit but the insert and tray did not. I went on again and see it now listed for Aprilaire 600. I am not sure if this was a mistake or not. This part came up as a suggested item when I purchased the filter so it may be linked to the filter by mistake. At any rate, I await a reply and will update if they send the right parts. As for the filter, it works great. The old insert was not defective, just a little dirty. I'd still replace it because it's original and the unit is old...but it works."
5,Ford Falcons - Ford's Better Idea,"Ford's slogan during its cool heyday was ""Drive a Ford! It's a Better Idea! Ford Gives You Better Ideas!"" with the trademark lightbulb.The 1960 Ford Falcon was one of the coolest cars Ford ever made and was one of the coolest cars to ever grace a road. The beautiful, lightweight streamlined little Ford was the car that could and did.Snoopy of ""Peanuts"" fame was drawn in the 1960 brochure to advertise this very serious car. And yeah, Ford Falcons were definitely a Better Idea!I just LOVE that car!"
2,Hard to use art,"When I first installed the program I was able to access the images, but since that first time I haven't. My operating system is XP and I don't know if that is the problem with the software. I have since then uninstalled it. I did not think this product was very easy to use."
1,Simply does not work,"You can get the driver to install succesffuly, but the Datapilot software fails to communicate with the phone. To top it off, this cale would be like $5 if they made it in larger quanities."
4,The Passionate Johnny,"Yes, I know this is a classic. Nevertheless, it is not the easiest of Hallyday's work for me to listen to. I became a fan in the late 70's when JoJo was softening his edges, so the raw emotion and huge production of ""Vie"" is hard for me to take. ""Essayez"" is probably my favorite cut - powerful in impact yet easy to understand - I bet, even if you don't speak French.While some of the pieces are inspirational, this is not an uplifting album. If you want an album to figuratively rip your guts out and get you in touch with long-supressed emotion, this is the one. If you want something provocative to listen to while sipping your cafe creme, try ""Rock 'n Roll Attitude"" or ""C'est la Vie""."
1,How can I give a review when I can't listen to examples ????,Please give me some examples so I can give you my opinion
2,"Some nuggets, but you have to dig","This is Helen Palmer's second book, and a bit disappointing. The information here is somewhat better than her first book as one would hope, but ""Love and Work"" is poorly written, even ungrammatical. The combinations of the different enneagram points in relationship is the best part of the book, but these descriptions seem uneven and undeveloped. Some of the relationships described sounded more accurate than others. This book could have been really interesting, but I found it unsatisfying."
3,ok,This one was Just OK... I prefer the Ultra compilations and also a new one I found on itunes EURO CLUB HITS VOL. 1 ......
5,A Book To Live By (and work by too),"The valuable life lessons expressed in this book benefit people in every demographic. It helps me put my life into perspective, and is a great help when work and life don't seem to be going my way. I can't think of a better way to end my day than by reading the stories from the world's most influential people inside Success Built to Last. Don't miss this book!"
3,Would make a good 20-page article...but as a book: too much,"I admire the amount of research, scientific tabulation and analysis that these three distinguished and accomplished gentlemen put into 'Success Built to Last.' Still - and I'm almost chagrined to say this because I wanted so much to like it - I simply never felt connected to any part of the book. Like others on these pages, I felt that the authors had the makings here of an excellent 20 - 25 page article. But a 200+ page book is a stretch. I found it repetitious and guilty in many places of making a technical case of the obvious. Moreover, though the authors take pains not to present their trafficking in rarefied circles in boastful ways, I could only stomach so many stories of them 'quivering' before Nelson Mandela and kibbutzing with Bono at Davos...and then taking an off-hours phone call from Richard Branson as he sailed through the Caribbean. Pretty neat, I will admit. Still, a bit too much after a while."
5,Success Built to Last,"Excellent content for developing leadership abilities. Easy to read and understand, loads of examples of successful leaders to reflect upon."
1,The Success of Others,"This book brags so much about the success of others such as Maya Angelou, John McCain, Jimmy Carter, etc. but offered no practical way to apply to your own life. The book labels these people as Builders, as though your existence as an individual is insignificant. As I read it, I said to myself, ""the information in this book is useless"", but I kept reading until the end because I wanted to finish what I had started."
5,This Book Helped Me Get My Passion Back,"I'd been meaning to read this book for over a year now. Now that I've read it, I wish I would've read it earlier. The message of the book helped me refocus on my true passion (helping as many people as possible get fit), rather than the road I had been going on (working in fitness management). Since I got back on my path, I've been so much happier and feel that much more confident that I'll ultimately reach my goals and be a better person. This book was the stimulus. I hope it does as much for you as it did for me.Doug Jackson[...]"
3,So-so book,"This book has some good ideas/messages; however, it is not at all up to bar set by ""Built to Last"" and ""Good to Great"". The examples/stories are interesting, but it feels like the same message is being rehashed over and over in different ways--could be covered in a well-written 20 pages vs. the 200+ it takes. Also, it did not strike me as particularly well written--I even caught a misspelled word."
3,I guess it was ok.,"Like many, once you write a bestselling book, you turn out a sequel to cash in on the success. He should've covered that concept in his book. It was ok, but no great."
4,Familiar advice from high achievers,"From 1996 to 2006, Jerry Porras, Stewart Emery and Mark Thompson interviewed more than 200 ""enduringly successful people,"" seeking their personal insights as a follow-up to Porras' bestselling book Built to Last. The authors began each interview with an open-ended question designed to provoke an unstructured conversation about the meaning of success. The authors drew from these highly personalized revelations to extrapolate the qualities that high achievers share, particularly a driving desire to have meaningful impact. The authors vetted their perceptions by surveying business experts about their findings. While the book's ideas aren't new - follow your passion, be optimistic, build a great team - they are reliable, and the insight into business celebrities' thoughts is instructive and valuable. If you share the drive to make a difference and lead a life of purpose, we recommend this book. It can help you pursue your goals with gusto."
5,A MUST read for anyone who wants to build succss that lasts!,"This is a book who's time has come. Mark, Stewart and Jerry have written a book that is not only inspiring but also provides every individual who reads it practical insights on how to truly define success. It is always interesting to hear from famous individuals on their path to success, but Thompson, Emery and Porras don't stop there they quantify their results and leave the reader with a practical outline that will help them in their own personal journey to creating a life that matters. I LOVE THIS BOOK!"
2,Disappointment,"I bought the same knife at the show last weekend - I was very impressed with the design, balance and materials. I thought I could use another one - it was so well made. I found the same knife on Amazon - it was much cheaper! I immediately bought 2! When they arrived they were representations of the great design but Made in China. Fit was very poor, sheath was a joke (completely useless)and I will not comment on the quality of the blade. Very disappointed. You get what you pay for. Look for the older versions Made in USA - they are worth the higher price. Just a question for Schrade - at the show people were buying knives left and right in the range of $50 to $250 - do you really have to make it in China where people are paid pennies and the difference goes to the middle man?Greg"
1,Kidding me????,Anybody who buys this album does not know real musicKiddish lyrics to the extremeGo get the Teletubbies or something else but this album is terrible
2,Would not recommend for beginners,"I read the book first thinking it would be different from the CD. Then I played the CD and it's as if the woman is reading from the book. I was disapointed. If you understand the positions of yoga, this is a good CD for your daily practice. However, I would recommend a DVD for beginners so they can see the instructor and how to position their body.I also did not find the CD motivating. It's as if the instructor just reads the position to you. I prefer a classroom setting where I can see the instructor and vice versa. Instructors understand we have good days and bad and will provide more motivation."
4,Very soothing and helpful in giving you specifics on Chakra balancing,Fairly inexpensive self help package. Comes with a workbook that walks you through each chakra level and also gives you suggestions on exercises to do to assist you. CD one is a guided meditation through the chakras and CD two is a yoga program and night meditation. The whole package works together to give you a comlete overview of the chakra system and ways to balance each area. I recommend this for anyone interested in chakras and has a need to improve certain areas of their life.
4,My thoughts on the Chakra Balancing Kit,"I am relatively new to the field of Chakras - and I found that this ""kit"" was very helpful and informative. I learned a lot not only about myself, but why I act and react the way I do. I highly recomend this book - or kit - to anyone that needs to learn more about themselves.From the very first exercise, I learned why I had ended up in some of the ""messes"" that I continued to find myself in. It was amazing."
3,One nineteenth of Michelet's history,"This is the nineteenth volume of Michelet's HISTORY, not the full HISTORY. It looks as if the full history is not available on Kindle, but only volumes of it here and there. Better to get it free elsewhere, if for no other reason, then to protest against the unending sloppiness in Kindle's management of multi-volume works like this.And of course better to get it free elsewhere because elsewhere -- it's free!"
3,Might try something else first,"I ordered this direct from ED Foods in a sampler pack. This was the best of the bunch. However, it wasn't all that great. Lots of noodles that kept floating to the top and a little weak. Try two at a time if you're making a small mug. Surprisingly, the much maligned Liptons Chicken noodle has a much better flavor. Notice this says ""Chickeny"" not Chicken. There's a difference."
1,Wrong CD,"Ordered Essential Vince Gill, received Alabama Greatest Hits Vol IIIThere is a white label on the back of case that indicates Essential Vince Gill, apparently processed based solely on the that labelThe Alabama CD is fine just not what I ordered."
5,Really good,I own the movie and it was really accurate. I also bought Winning London soudtrack and both are REALLY good! This has ALL of the songs from the movie. Really enjoyable!
2,Olsen Twin Madness,"I have seen all of the Olsen Twins' movies and television shows. They're cute and all, but mostly super lucky (who else do you know that was worth millions before they could even read). tHE CD includes mostly fast and up beat songs, but the few slow songs are awesome too. The best part of this cd is that it doesn't includ the olsen twins singing (most of their cds do). If you liked the songs from the movie you will defidently like this cd. You should buy this cd and help give more money to the Olsen Twins (like they need it!!!).PS: Don't you just love how every movie focuses around the girls finding two hot guys that they always make-out with by the end of the movie?"
1,Pretty Dumb........,This CD stinks. Would've given it 0 stars if I could. Bad words Not like the movie.
1,the newest version is at $49.95 MRPby Sennheise,"PC25 has probably discontinued for ages, that's why you can't find it anywhere else to compare the prices. the newer version is PC26, at here: [...]and it's priced at $49.95 by the manufacturer."
4,So good a bought another one,"I really like the features of this watch: analog display w/the benefits of alarm, countdown timer, and a stopwatch most digital watches have. And it was only $30 on sale. My first one lasted a couple years then when the battery died, it ended up killing the beeper. Yes, when the battery got low, the beeper went to full beeeeeeeep until it killed the battery and the beeper. But I liked it enough that I bought a second one. That one has lasted 5 years (3 batteries now), and is still going strong. The leather strap will last about as long as the battery (about 2 years), depending on how much you use Indiglo, and how much water you expose it to.Overall, I really like this watch."
3,Nice looking but heavy,"This watch looks great and was a very good price. But it is a bit heavy so is not as comfortable as my husband would like. It also makes a slight clicking noise that we only notice at night when it's perfectly quiet. But if we put in in a drawer, we can't hear it."
1,Bezel doesn't rotate,"In both the description and the instruction sheet that comes with the watch it clearly states that the bezel rotates. But it doesn't. Since the rotating bezel was my primary reason for ordering this watch, I can only give it one star.If you want a rotating bezel watch, try:Timex Men's T45181 Expedition Analog and Digital Combo WatchThe rotating bezel is incredibly useful -- at the start of an activity, rotate the bezel to align the zero mark with the minute hand, and you can tell at a glance how long it has been since you started (I believe scuba divers are the primary customers for this technology, but it is useful for timing everything from the barbeque to the parking meter).So when I saw Timex had come out with a more attractive rotating-bezel watch, I ordered it. But somewhere between design and implementation the rotating bezel got lost. What a disappointment, since in all other respects this is an attractive and useful watch."
5,Very nice,"Great quality, husband loves it!! It is a little larger than I thought but he wears it everyday! Can't go wrong"
1,Stopped working,"The watch stopped working after about 2 months. I thought it was the battery, but the watch started back up again about a couple weeks later. I got the battery replaced today, and it stopped working again. Clearly a defective piece."
4,Timex Men's T45201 Expedition,"The watch is definitely worth it. My favorite part is how the hands can glow in the dark, even though its only for a few minuets. Its a good weight; not too heavy or too light. The only downside would be that every other week or so, I have to readjust the time. It would be off my a few seconds, and that would annoy me a bit. Im not sure if the watch is a bit too fast, or if I cant set it as exactly 12 on the exact time. Buts its generally on the right time,just not exactly precise. But overall, its still a very good watch."
4,Nice watch for a perfect price.,"A good purchase for these money. If you don't screw its brains too much, it's gonna serve you pretty well for a long time.Well, otherwise, in case of a glitch (yeah, that may happen if you play with it pretty intensively :), press and hold all four buttons to reset watches to their default settings."
4,"Nice watch, but...","Unfortunately, this watch does not have a rotating bezel as claimed in the product description. The features that it does have are very handy and I've used a similar Timex expedition watch on an around the world trip after college. There were no problems whatsoever and it even worked fine scuba diving to 18m. The lack of the rotating bezel is a drawback however."
4,Class-required,"It was required for Anthropology class, but I'm glad I read it. New perspective! Very clear writing which will help when I go write about an exhibit for my term paper."
5,How to achieve piece of mind as a woman and a firm body,"Every woman should read this book, Karen is entertaining and makes exercise fun. She addresses the true feelings of women and their bodies. Dance has never been so fun"
1,Nostalgic Fan,"A big fan of the show, I was extatic when I heard there was a poster of it. It was a bit smaller than I hoped, but that's nothing to complaign about really. What I was disappointed in was the quality of the print. It's not even a poster, just a big print that looks like it's from an old HP printer. You can CLEARLY see the lines left by the printer where it looks like texture on their shirts but you realize it's all over the picture. I'm sure this was only with my copy there's also a big white ""blob"" covering the green section next to the ABC logo. This was the second poster I purchased from this company, I was hoping it would be better than the last one, but I was sadly (and ignorantly) ripped off a second time and I shant be ordering from them again."
4,Product Does As Promised.........,"My one complaint about these bags[all brands] is the need for a longer tube. It is quite restrictive in bed, causing pulling of the leg. This is equally as problematic with pants on. Its like a ball and chain, not the most comfortable. This gives a pulling sensation, limiting mobility space. Constantly, you must rethink where to hang your bag to create better comfort, and range of motion."
2,Could use improvements!,"I think the magnetic rod is a very good idea, but improvements could be made to this particular product.Using stronger magnetics would be key. If not, then drop the price by $10.00. I DO NOT think it is a value for the price.I have a curtain that is less than two pounds and every time the door is opened or closed it slips on one side. I don't want to have to adjust it EVERY time I open or close the door. It was very difficult to remove the end so the curtain can be placed onto the rod. Now, that side doesn't want to stay together! I would not order this product again."
4,Wishes do come true,"Occasionally the accents were hard to follow but the story line was sweet and left me with a ""good things can come from bad circumstances"" kind of feeling. This movie was more of a real-life fairy tale that leaves you feeling good."
4,Is she or isn't she,"An Irish fisherman played by Colin Farrell hauls up an interesting prize in his trawler net. It is a beautiful creature named Ondine (Alicja Bachleda) Ondine means from the sea. She seems a little awkward of the world. So when the fisherman tells his daughter (Alison Barry) the tale she knows he found a selkie, a mythical sea creature with powers and abilities. The fisher man is starting to see things through his daughter's eyes and so are we. Will the selkie stay for the allotted seven years or be carried away by her sea husband? Let's hope everything turns out all right as in a fairytale.The highlight of the film for me is the encounters of the fisherman Syracuse and the local priest played by Stephen Rea."
4,Beautiful film but hard to follow what they are saying.,If ever a film needed English subtitles this is one. The accents and soft talking are great but hard to follow storyline as you can't understand what they are saying and with no subtitles. Her songs were just beautiful and the story is great but a lot of it is lost on not catching what they are saying. But is was a refreshing movie from most out there now. Fine acting and story.
2,Fantasy or Melodrama?,Neil Jordan's Ondine starring the always dependable Colin Farrell and the enchanting Polish actress.The 1st 3 quarter of the film was captivating with the suitable Irish background and mystery.It fell apart at the final quarter. It became nothing but a routine eastern mafia smuggling alien to a foreigncountry plot which destroyed all the foregoing mystery and enchantment.A very disappointing recent effort from Neil Jordan.
1,could not get film to play!,"I could not get this dvd to play, so I am unable to print a review. if you resend the film, and if i am able to access it, then i will review it."
2,Very Boring!!!,"I'm sorry, but I found this movie to be incredibly boring. Some friends forced me to watch it. Colin Farrell stars as an Irish fisherman named Syracuse who finds a woman named Ondine in his fishing net. He and his daughter, Annie believe she is a mermaid. I wouldn't recommend ONDINE!!!"
1,What did he say?,"My daughter and I struggled all the way through this . . . movie. It was almost impossible to understand the dialogue. We had to look up the summary online to even know what was going on. We spent a good part of the time saying to each other, ""What did he/she say?"" I love movies with character and plot development; but if this movie had those, I must have missed it. We dismissed the review that said it was boring - need four more words - boring, boring, boring, boring. They were so right. The only good part that was noted was Colin Farrell's lovely accent. If only the movie had had a good sound engineer!"
5,It has heart!,"This movie took me to another place.. From the soundtrack, to the cinematography, to the script, to the chemistry between characters ... Just magical!! I could watch it a hundred times... I probably did!"
4,Loved it,A slightly mysterious love story that urns suspenseful inear the end. So many themes and plots are predictable these days. This had an interesting twist.
2,Ondine DVD,I was so disappointed. The DVD did not have subtitles in ANY Language. The story looked great... but I could not understand the HEAVY accents. I am positive that I missed most of the movie by not knowing what they were actually saying to each other.
4,Love this movie,"Mystery and love, woven together with the reality of the difficulties that life offers, a very wonderful film, which I highly recomend"
5,Ondine,"I've seen this movie twice and it's beautiful movie. It's fairy tale, romance, and thriller, all in one. But, will someone please explain to me when he asks her if the man chasing her is her husband she says (in Romanian) ""He's my fish"" What????"
3,Ondine,It's not what I thought. I read the play years ago and it's not the play made into a movie. I did enjoy listening to the accents.
3,One of the Worst Photographed Films Ever,"If you like films underexposed to the point of black, this is the film for you. Too bad, because the bad cinematography obscures some attractive characters."
3,Manipulative but pretty good at it,"Colin Farrell drags out his thickest Irish accent in the story of a fisherman who pulls a woman from the sea and can't quite decide if he (and his crippled daughter) want her to be a mermaid or not. It tries really hard, and succeeds at a level only just a bit below what it's aiming for."
5,Best for Mosquito Bites,"This is an excellent product! My family has tried a LOT of anti itch creams and sticks, but this is one of the few that doesn't sting, works quickly, and lasts. My daughter refuses to have me use anything else. Unfortunately, finding it has been hit and miss locally, so I'm really glad to find it here!"
1,Very Poorly Written,"Don't waste your money!! Very poorly organized and lacks substance. Practically unbearable to read. I am a DBIA Designated Design-Build Professional and if you want to learn about Design-Build buyDesign-Build: Planning Through Development, not this waste of paper by Levy."
2,"Impressive lineup, mediocre sound","One of the more exploratory projects to have emerged from the Washington, D.C./Dischord Records underground, All-Scars are an improvised-rock quartet, described by their own record label as, uh, ""a reflection and response to social forces and utilize [sic] anything that makes sound as an inspiration."" Well versed in everything from dub to post-punk to pointless noise, All-Scars are also current and former members of Fugazi, Fidelity Jones, Las Mordidas, Beefeater, the Meta-matics, and the Trance and the Arcade. On this, their debut album, All-Scars throw disparate musical languages and instruments, as well as unusually explicit political stances, into a forum. They spend 16 tracks moving toward a resolution, developing some interesting sounds along the way but ultimately making the kind of improv that seems a lot more enjoyable to create than it is to hear."
2,Ok,I am use to the headphones from Sony that the band fits behind the head. I will use these if my Sony goes out or I forget them.
5,A Ride Worth Taking!,"I just loved A-Train Lullaby. (I just finished it last night with tears in my eyes -- and not just because it had come to an end ...) This book really captured my interest with it's creative approach and made me want to know more and read more. I found the book to be insightful, spritual, courageous and (last but not least) FUNNY! I love the way Ms. Flores assigned ""names"" to the people in her life. The book stirred so many wonderful emotions in me -- it was a ride worth taking!"
1,The title sums it up,"Cluttered by New Age lunacy, cheerfully anti-scientific, full of assumptions and anthropomorphism, this book may go over well with the Hallmark duckies-and-bunnies crowd, but birders will find it all a bit hard to swallow. Although the author is obviously sincere, and often capable of close observation, ""Mr. Picky"" is just too heavy-laden with nineteenth-century sentimentality and moralizing to take seriously."
2,The Misadventures of Bethany Price,"The writing of this novel did not achieve the level that THE REVOLT OF SARAH PERKINS set. Although the plot is rather weak, the characters seem realistic. It just did not capture my attention."
5,Topic best done by an outsider,"Wilson covers a lot of ground and gives a good sense of the historical background and issues surrounding ""what is a Ukrainian"" without taking sides - something tough for a Russian, Ukrainian, or Pole to do.The current politics is really nicely covered - I had the opportunity to watch the Orange revolution first hand - and its interesting to see the pangs of democracy's birth - and wondering where it will go."
1,"Cute, but...Piece of Crap!!!!!!!!!!","This bedding was so cute I absolutley had to have it for my son, seeing his daddy is all about sports. It has been fine up until now, we have only had it for 5 months and it is falling apart! The manufacturer's label says you can wash and dry the bumpers, so I did, exactly as directions indicated. When it came out of the dryer, it had shrunk so bad it no longer fit and the head bumper was all deformed and was sagging in the middle no matter how I tried to tie it. Also the ties came off when I was tying it back on! Save your money and spend it on another bedding set....this one is cute, but not worth it!"
3,An adorable set but a waste of money,We registered for this for our first son. While I LOVE the theme I found the bedding to be a waste of money for many reasons. #1 the bumpers were a suffocation hazard and I had to remove them when my son began rolling over. #2 The comforter is heavy and is also a suffocation hazard so we do not use that. #3 the bed sheet is not 100% cotton and I found that it didn't fit as well as a standard crib bed sheet. I find the 100% cotton sheet is softer and more comfortable.I would have just registered for the valances and decorated his room around that because for [price] there is a lot that we could not use. But it is VERY adorable.
3,Club USA 6-piece crib bedding set,"The purchase did arrive well my only complaint was that it did not arrive on time, it arrived much later than it was expected to."
4,We love it...,"the comforter is a bit heavy but comforters are never recommended inside of a crib while a baby is in there. It's great as a decorative piece, especially with the 3-d bear, just as we may have nice comforters on our beds just to dress them up.I thought the sheet could've been of a better quality - I found them a little rough. I like the headboard bumper...it really gives the crib a nice look. Overall, I think it's a great set for a baby boy and I would choose it again."
4,"Cute, but better for babies that are little older","We love this theme for our little boy but he won't be able to use it for at least a year because it's a bit heavy and bulky. His whole room is decorated in this theme and is so adorable, but I would recomend waiting until baby is out of the SIDS risk timeline to utilize everything in the bedding collection. There was only one problem with one of the item in this set. The diaper stacker broke when we put the diapers in. Apparently the hanger wasn't sturdy enough to handle the weight so we changed it out with a plastic one. Other than that it's great."
1,Terrible,"Is Kihlstrom resting on her laurels after the popular Westcott series? It certainly looks like it; even the last couple of books in that series looked as if she was running out of steam and couldn't be bothered putting together an interesting or convincing plot.This book was, frankly, boring. The characters inspired no interest in me whatsover, even though the plot as described on the cover and on this site should have interested me. Kihlstrom's attention to detail and to factual accuracy is also very poor. I enjoyed some of her Westcott books - although she's not on a par with Balogh, Oliver or Kelly, those books were entertaining. After 'The Reckless Barrister' I can safely say that I never intend to read anything by Kihlstrom again."
1,Tedious in the extreme,"This was one of the most tedious books - and poorly told/written - that I have read in a long time. It took forever to finish and if I had not wasted my money on buying the book, I would have returned it to the Library after the first 20 pages. Save your money as I can not think of one amusing or interesting thing about this book!"
4,Worth Hearing!,"Savoy Brown's Kim Simmonds releases his second solo acoustic CD in 4 years and it is evey bit as good as the first. All songs on the CD are originals penned and performed by Simmonds. The lyrics are well written but, according to Simmond's, not autobiographical. On this CD, which tends to lean strongly toward country blues, Simmond's is assisted on various tracks by Bob Hall on piano (Savoy Brown) as well as bassist Pat DeSalvo and drummer Garnet Grimm.While there is nothing here to make this CD standout from the pack of other country blues CD's released in the last couple of years, Simmonds certainly would be in the top 20. Overall, a decent effort."
4,Pinoy Music to the World,"This has long been overdue, Filipino pop music that really speaks of the Filipino people's culture, dreams and aspirations. Quite different from the American Top 40 inspired trash that pollutes the country's airwaves. Hanopol's music is engaging with haunting lyrics in Filipino (Tagalog)that oftentimes conjure images of the country's sad state, culturally and economically. This is a must for allTagalog-speaking Filipinos living in the US or other countries. Grace Nono sings mostly from her heart with her voice exuding pathos than her peers who have become local superstars. This should also be of interest to non-Filipinos who through the album might be able to take a glimpse at how contemporary pop is evolving in this part of the globe."
4,Comfortable,Headsets are very comfortable and provides very good phone call quality.I just wish it would feel a little more tight on head. A lot of timesI have to squeeze them tight into my ears to be able to hear peoplewhen the connection is not very clear.
3,"Poorly organized, bloated, poor english",This book doesn't need to be this heavy and big. Repetitious code abounds and it is very badly organized. Very frustrating to read. It is good for beginners but it just isn't worth the price. I am eagerly waiting for David Flanagan's JFC in a Nutshell. I advise not to buy it.
4,A competent how-to book and useful reference.,"In addition to this JFC book, I also have Gutz's book and Weiner & Asbury's Programming with JFC. This is certainly the most comprehensive of the three.Basic and more advanced examples are offered, and each class that is covered includes a very handy public methods reference.The coverage on JTables is inadequate in all three books, but Java Foundation Classes at least touches on most of the JTable features.Not perfect, but definitely worth the money."
2,I would wait until other JFC books come to market!,This book offers very little in comparison to Sun's online documentation. It is not well organized-- a very simple overview and an underwhelming 700pp. API reference section. I would definately wait until a more critical book is published on the JFC.
2,Doesn't live up to the original,"Incredibly boring for the first 20 minutes, this sequel failed to hold my interest. 28 Days was creative and interesting but this sequel is underwhelming."
2,Nope...,"Maybe I'm just getting old (33 is ancient), but I did not like this movie. The story was fine, aside from the fact that (SPOILER ALERT) everyone dies, and I loved the soundtrack, but this was a gory, over-the-top violent film. With ""28 Days Later"", there was at least some time to breathe and relax between the violent scenes. Not the case with this movie. I had to turn my head during the helicopter scene, and was actually hoping for the movie to finish.I've seen alot of horror films and am pretty desentized, but this one really bothered me. I need some relaxation time between my massacres."
5,Wanna see it again,"What a sequel, it is very dificult to compare it to ""28 Days Later"" which won several awards back on 2004 including ""Best Horror Film"" of the year, but for many people I know, the sequel is better than the original. ""28 Weeks Later"" is again: shocking, scary and disturbing like the prequel!!! There's a lot of suspense, action, and gore... you always want to have some more, and I'm very happy that the end leaves open the possibility for a third part. Rage virus seems to be unstoppable and as soon as you manage to get into the movie with out any type interruption you'll feel like there's no escape, that you're trapped and soon you'll be eaten too. For me, ""28 Days Later"" was better but ""28 Weeks Later"" was well directed and acted, with a great plot, that I could not give less than 5 stars. I Can't wait to have a DVD copy full with extras."
2,"i thought it fell short of the first one,but there are some great action sequences(2.5/5)","i have to say,i was disappointed in this follow up to ""28 Days Later"".don't get me wrong,there were some great moments in this movie,particularly the action scenes,which were frenetic and relentless.the problem i found is there weren't enough of these intense scenes.i felt the movie had too many slow spots.i did however like the look of the ""infected"".they looked much more enraged than in the first movie.the action scenes,when they occurred,were better than the first one,but overall,the movie did not quite meet my expectations.i give ""28 Weeks Later"" 2.5/5"
3,Spare the Rod - Spoil the Child,"Warning - movie spoiler below.Too bad the homely boy and his stupid sister weren't shot outright once they exited the perimeter and disobeyed the law. So much disaster could have been avoided. It may not be all their fault however because these children came from very stupid gene stock. Shortly after they returned with their infected mother, their uninfected father knowingly kissed (and exchanged infected saliva) with their infected mother and yes both mommy and daddy knew she was infected. These two got their just rewards.The movie was OK except for the fact all the good guys were killed (including a hero military guy who stopped to help them) and these brats got away to spread it everywhere else which is more sickening than the disease."
2,Relentless downer,"""28 Days Later"" was a groundbreaking zombie movie that reinvigorated the genre. Fast-paced, interesting and at the end optimistic, the fast zombies it introduced were a necessary part of the fast pace of the plot. I thought it was a great movie, so I had high expectations for the sequel.I shouldn't have wasted my time. With a different director and different characters, ""28 Weeks Later"" is just another zombie movie. It's predictable, slow and uninteresting. Sure, the effects are nice, and some of the photography isn't bad. But in the end, this is a paint-by-numbers B movie that is a relentless downer from start to finish. Avoid."
3,not a bad follow up,"i give it 3.5 stars. 28 weeks later is not a bad film, but this one plays more like an action flick than a horror. the only problem i had with the film was that it kinda felt like they rushed production ( dont know if that is true or not) but all in all still a good flick needed a bit more horror than action. more gore than the 1st. if u are a fan of these films then check it out."
2,Problem of the sequel,"Although I enjoyed the first movie in this series, 28 Weeks Later is a typical case of a sequel that trends to the middle and adds bigger budget effects and more action. The post-apocalyptic theme is not altogether absent, but changed and no longer focused on a small band of survivors. If this appealed to you at all in the original, you are likely to be disappointed.Interestingly, my original review of this movie was much longer and more involved but didn't get posted somehow. I suspect it was because of my criticism of this company's streaming video service. They sent me an e-mail telling me the problem was with my computer or my connection, or anything else, all of which does not explain why I have no problem watching video on competing services. Be warned: you get about 20 min viewing time before you have to start reloading the page and restarting the film."
2,28 days later,"It was a waste of time,energy, and money! Was very disappointing! Would not recommend this movie to anyone at all!"
2,Next to lousy film,"Considering how bad zombie films typicall are with the poor acting and zero plot, this film is better than worst. But better than worst is not exactly good."
4,Always a good jump.,Great for what it is. They need to make another one. I think this time set in the US on the east coast.
4,"One of the better recent ""zombie"" flicks","I bought this and the following film (28 Weeks Later) through a special buy on Amazon on impulse. This is one of the better recent zombie style films even though I have to endure the English accents. However, regarding the BD version of this film, if the DVD version is a lesser price, I see no reason to purchase the BD version as the quality is not up to par with typical HD quality."
4,28 Weeks Later,"28 Weeks LaterGood - will watch it once again...Must watch ""28 Days Latter"" (2003/04) first to fully understand.For those ""Walking Dead"" followers..."
4,"If you didn't like the first one, you won't like this one.",I like these types of movies and I don't analyze details of movies like this...I just watch. I do enjoy it.
3,This movie does not have a single zombie.,Good movie. Many plot holes. The security is so poor it could only have been designed by a mall cop. My most important point to everyone is.....these are not zombies!!! Zombies are dead. Plain and simple. These are infected. Still alive. Just like in I am legend. Not zombies. Infected. Its black and white.
2,Don't waste your time,"I was so disappointed in this movie. I recently watched the progenitor film, 28 Days Later, and I was pleasantly surprised; for a trite genre, the movie had real character development, tension, some out-and-out scary scenes and some personal drama. This movie? Not so much.Let me preface by saying that I am a huge fan of Robert Carlyle: I think he's one of the best actors working today. And this movie started out well; the first 20 - 30 minutes laid the groundwork for a great story. But it all degenerated into gore, cheap FX, and beyond-stupid ""don't go down to the dark basement alone"" horror movie gimmickry.If I could, I'd give it 1 and 1/2 stars; because *hate* is a bit too strong, but truly: this is 2 hours I'm never getting back."
1,95% Suck,"Aside from the fantastic opening sequence and a great cast this sequel sucks...it's boring, predictable and suffers from several logic gaps too wide for common sense to bridge. No spoilers here but the third act chase is so utterly implausible that it's downright insulting. It really shows complete contempt for the viewer's intelligence...Then again it is the third act so why bother waking the writer now?"
2,Surpasses the original? I think not.,"If they hadn't said this movie surpasses the original, I may not have expected as much. But I did and the movie didn't deliver for me. From start to finish all this movie was is screaming, running, biting and shooting. And that's pretty much it.It'll take far more than just a ""clever"" (well, not really) plot to surpass 28 Days Later."
2,Rent don't buy,"The story is believable, the acting pretty good but what goes wrong? The movie is basically just boring to me. I guess if all you care about is blood and guts then this is your movie. The story is unfortunately overshadowed by the blood and guts therefore the story becomes choppy and rather silly. It's an entertaining rental although a little boring, if you have absolutely nothing better to do for the night."
4,Pretty Good Sequel (has spoilers),"28 weeks later was a great sequel. It tied in very well with the first, yet can still stand alone as it's own film.28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition)Not super gorey like other ""zombie"" type films like land of the dead, but has some imaginative ways of killing the ""rage-infected"" with flying a helicopter low enough to chop them up, gasing them and setting them on fire with blow torches. The story moves very well and makes you think of human conciousness and also their thoughtless ways of ""solving"" problems. They left it open for a 3rd (pay attention to the epilogue right before the credits) and I'm sure it would be a great welcome in the world of horror. If you like this film and love the more gorey movies, also check out Grindhouse-To me, the BEST cinema experience I've had in years!!!Grindhouse. And for you horror music fans check out the following:Transylvania 90210: Songs of Death, Dying, and the DeadBeyond the Valley of the MurderdollsEducated Horses"
1,Meh,"This is the sequel to 28 days later, and I thought it was pretty weak. An entirely predictable plot from start to finish, featuring annoyingly silly teenage protagonists, their dad, and a group of somewhat dim NATO soldiers. I was disappointed because the first film was well done, had an interesting plot and was surprising. This film the children take over with their TSTL (too stupid to live) antics, and the plot devolves into horror/slasher formula. The moment the children arrived in the military zone I predicted they'd do something really moronic. I was disappointed to be right.I enabled close captions, which was convenient when I fast forwarded all the chase scenes that the director apparently considered plot development. This way I could read the sparse dialog without feeling the need to slow down.The ending was almost the only interesting part of the film. Perhaps a sequel would be better.Overall? I give this one a star. It was barely watchable and boring in its banality."
4,Great Thriller,"I really enjoyed this movie. It is one of the great ""end of the world"" type movies, that really gets your heart racing. The video/audio on the blu-ray is awesome as well. Highly recommend if you're into these types of movies, and want a little scare."
4,Better than the first!,"Very well done. I was surprised. I liked it better than the first (28 Days Later). If you like this kind of movie, you'll enjoy this one."
3,"ok, but...","Action and gore filled. But the characters were unlikable and they had no developement. It was also a little predictable. I liked the whole 'cure' possibility, which of course is something that makes a sequel quite possible. The intriguing, little details, and camera work gave '28 Days' a certain style. This same stylistic attempt in '28 Weeks' just didn't worked for me. Seemed stale, familiar shots. But it did do a good job of linking the sequels stylistically. If you saw the first, see the second Just because. Hopefully your disappointement will be less than my own."
2,Coincidence,"Out of a million zombies, one, known to our heroes, chases them thru London. How does that work? A good first movie. But this smacks of a money chasing event. AH, THE HORROR."
3,Talk about a let down,"I am so disappointed by this film.The first was awesome, but this film comes along and tries to ruin wh hard to follow (the plot is so at the first did.It's hard to follow (the plot is so full of holes)It's poorly shot (The first one was innovative atleast, this one contains a 15 minute handheld nightvision shot) I believe the camera man was having a seizureYou fell nothing for the characters (there is little to no development)Way to ruin a franchise!"
1,omg this movie does not deserve even 3 stars,ok i think theres alot of crazies out there for rating this movie the way they did cuz this movie sucked so bad theres only two good things about this movie and the first is the good 2 minute killing in the very begining and the second is the omg gruesome death scene of the guys wife as you see him just i mean just beat and rip the crap out of his wife having that said i was hoping this movie would be much better than the first which was a good movie but i bought this movie and watched it with friends and besides the very short part in the begining theres nooooo action in this movie till the end of the movie the first hour of the movie is so slow and omg boringand every time you think you've found the main character they die
1,Bad Tellable Plot and Annoying Characters,The whole time you watch the movie you watch it hoping the main characters will die for their stupidity and for causing the rehash of the virus so it's just an annoying movie. The characters aren't anything to sympathize with considering their blatant stupidity and messing up everything without thinking plus they're ugly.
1,Skip It,"I thought that ""28 Days Later"" had a bit of an oddness, but it still seemed to have some bit of a story to it. Well, with ""28 Weeks Later"" there is the beginning of an actual story in the beginning. It very quickly turns to not much and all heck breaks loose and it becomes more like a zombie movie.The ending will leave you lost. If it does this so that they can produce ""28 Months Later"", then I'll be passing. Save your money."
3,Entertaining But Still Came Up A Little Short,"I'm not bashing 28 Weeks Later because I did find it entertaining and slightly creepy. However I am going to say I did feel it dragged on quite a bit. There were times where I found myself pretty bored and hoping it was going to pick up. I know sequels usually don't measure up to the original so I'm not really going to compare the two. I do feel it would be worth a rental to see for yourself, but you probably won't be blown away."
2,"when the husband got to his wife so easily, I got out","The film makers must think their audiences are idiots, how else can you explain how easy the man got to see his wife without being stopped or seen by anyone in a supposedly secure military facility, why I don't understand how come other terrorist haven't sprung their friends from Gitmo"
2,"Good sequel, but the plot was so bad.","I thought the sequel was going to be better, but it was so predicted. In other words, you could guess what would happen in the movie. Some parts were so silly. The movie needs more originality. This movie reminds me of Resident Evil.The writers needed to put more reality to the sequel. For example, why would you want to go down in a subway tunnel when there is no light, food, protection, or nothing. It does not make sense. It is a stupidity...Don't even buy the movie. It is not worth it. If you want to rent it, OK. I think there are better movies available than this movie."
2,Strange Movie,I heard the first one was good but I did not care for that either. Just another movie of this type.
5,One of my favorites!,"I liked this movie even more than 28 Days Later. If you like zombies, this is a MUST HAVE. Great purchase."
3,not worth buying,this movie was definitely not worth buying it was an extremely grainy blu-ray recording the movie is decent but i don't think i could ever sit threw it again.
3,Doesn't live up to suspense of 28 days,"28 Days later had me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end. its defintely a classic horror, and i had high expectations from this sequel. It was good, but on a different level than the first. It seemed like the same old, and couldn't equal the crazy suspense of its predecessor. still worth taking a look at."
3,"Bloodier and more brutal than ""28 days later"". But it's not as suspenseful. It's worth renting.","This movie is bloodier and more brutal than ""28 days later"". It contains quite a few shocking killing scenes. On the contrary, they're more subtle in the orignal movie. And yet, the first installment is more supsensful and scarier. This sequel is still worth renting."
4,The Ok Type of a Sequel-Movie,"28 Days Later, awesome movie, one of my all time favrites, it didn't try to hard to be scary and jumpy and yet it was. But this one, its ok. I really hated how this movie told a different side to the story instead of telling what happened to those three people. The actors are awesome in this movie, though. They could have done a little better but hey what are you going to do. The only part that kind of sucked at this movie is the ending, it is so depressing and to make a long story short I am not going to look foward to the sequel. But hey don't take my word for it, i'm just telling you my opinion about this movie, you might be kind of dissapointed but entertained at times."
4,Better than I expected,"For a sequal, this was pretty good. There were some weak spots in the story but 28WL isn't exactly gunning for an academy award. Obviously, they had a much bigger budget because the production is noticably better. I especially like that they resisted the cliche ending I had expected. 28WL is good, as long as you don't expect too much.Recommended."
4,BELIEVABLE,"I couldn't believe that this movie was actually better than the first. It was so good that my mom actually enjoyed it as much as I did. We both hope that something like this never happens, but we couldn't help but put ourselves in the actors positions. In that respect, it was very real."
2,Could have waited anther 28 weeks to see this,"This is the second time this year that a sequel has called on US soldiers to fight off monsters. The Hills Have Eyes 2 was the other one. This movie starts off like a seizure with the camera being jerked around so much it felt like an ode to Blair Witch Project. Then he gets on a boat and sails away to peace and quiet. Then two kids uncover a survivor while roaming the empty streets and all hell breaks loose. It was a watchable movie but I would not rank it as one of the best horror movies of the year. Come to think of it, 2007 wasnt really a great time for horror movies. The only two movies I thought were worth watching was The Mist and 1408. Dont believe the hype though, this movie is alright but the first one was better."
2,Could Have Been Better,"I would have liked to see this be more science fiction than horror, but unfortunately it is mostly the latter. Considering the compelling premise of the excellent prequel, the best I can say about this film is that it's not too bad as a sequel. It does a fair job with the themes of cowardice and valor, and offers a promising twist on the premise that is, unfortunately, not developed to the extent that it could have been. The last scene opens the floodgates for Part III, which could be a great film. ""28 Months Later""?"
3,"Frighteningly good but disappointed by the ""family stuff""...","I really love the concept of 28 Days Later and 28 Weeks Later, fast moving zombies..thrilling and a new take on the living dead. But although i enjoyed this movie i didn't enjoy it as much as 28 Days Later.What I didn't like most about this movie was the ""family stuff"". I'm talking about the guy who abandoned his wife when she needed him, then finds his kids, then they find their mom, then he finds his wife, becomes a zombie-tortures the crap out of her and then pursues his kids the whole way through the movie. He ends up getting killed by his daughter at the end but not until after he bites and almost kills his son.I felt like there was too much of a relational/emotional plot that i didn't want. It makes me wonder was there a message trying to be communicated by the director, writers, etc???That aside the gore was awesome and the zombie's made my heart race which I enjoy."
2,"Not bad, not great.","28 Weeks Later is a good movie, but not great. Its worth watching once, and even worth owning so you can show your friends. Its not the timeless kind of movie that you could watch twice a year though. If you're looking for a timeless masterpiece in the zombie/horror genre I suggest Dawn of the Dead (the new one).Thank you for reading my review! If you enjoyed it, be sure to rate it as helpful."
1,nausea! videotography is terrible. The camera shakes all over the place,I was really looking forward to this sequal. But after trying to watch it I can NOT view the movie without getting motion sickness. You WILL get nauseous trying to watch this movie! The videotography is terrible. The camera shakes all over the place. If you want to buy a mint wide screen copy from Columbia House in original packing contact me. It will save me the trouble of selling it on ebay. Ug! :(
1,Stinker Sequel to a Stinker Original,"I STILL don't get it! The original movie was bad enough; did we have to have more of the same? As much as I don't mind accents, I couldn't understand a word of what was being said unless it was the US troops speaking. I was also looking for some thread of a plot - no dice. The infected were about as scary as my Dachshund. I know that some folks think these two movies are cult classics like the Romero zombies, and to each his own. If there's a third one brewing, I hope it's ""28 Years Later"" when I hope to be dead and gone!"
1,Nothing original here,"I watched this movie last night and I only wish I could claim my money back. The script is so far fetched and unoriginal it is laughable. Mad crazed zombies running amok in the city? Reminds me of the old video nasty collection of the living dead and the evil dead, but not as good. If you are looking for a film that has very little intellectual content and you just want to see gore, then this is the film for you."
1,An unworth sucessor to a great original,"Danny Boyle reinvented the Zombie genre with ""28 Days Later"" but this sequel does a disservice to the original. The moment you realize the plot involves children-in-peril you know the story is headed in the wrong direction. Would the US government really allow children to settle in a highly dangerous compound? Well, maybe yes, but only in a movie that disregards plausibility. If security of the compound is so critical, would it be that easy for the children to escape the quarantine? This leads to one of the most incredible coincidences in movie history, followed by what can only be described as ""cinematic-stupids"" when the most dangerous prisoner in the compound is left unguarded. Its better to savour the original than watch this mess of a movie."
2,28 Movie Executives Later,"Aside from a few very well done scenes this film was no good. A few scenes do not make a good film. I am not sure how with more money it is possible to screw up the sequel to what is arguably the best zombie film ever made but they did it.Zombie films are not for everyone. You know you are a true fan of zombie films if you were excited for this sequel. I was amongst the few hopefuls. I was let down. Mostly the film and more importantly the zombies did not have the raw, visceral, jacked, amped on speed and crack intensity the zombies from the first film did. This film just relied on shaky camera work mostly. And darkness. A lot of darkness.Forget the plot. All I need say was that there was a star zombie and a nuclear zombie family. A zombie film with family values. The plot went no where and did not propel the story anywhere except to Paris. A small chopper can not go from London to Paris. Suspension of disbelief is one thing but common.Skip it till DVD. Wait for cable."
4,Awesome. Scary as hell.,"I gave my boyfriend the ""6 Foot Rule"" after leaving the theater and seeing this film. Which means he is not allowed farther away from me than 6 feet. That should give you an idea of how effective it was.I am a pussy in scary movies, however. But even my horror-happy friends were scared by this.It's great. I liked it just as well as the first one. Yes."
2,Soul to Funk to Re-Funk,"It's fun to listen to these tracks, as a longtime fan who has internalized all the original hit singles and live album versions.However, this is decidely non-essential: there istoo much going on, technologically, and too much here is based upon later live recordings, not considered classic JB: an amalgam of Disco / Pop / slick attempts to *recreate* Funk.No doubt the remix contributors know and respect their subject. Thy've delivered a decent party"" record..but nothing for radio airplay or serious study.Perhaps the best result of this CD is to hopefully get the attention of Universal/Polydor, to do a (with all due respect to the JB Scientists) real, professional job of re-mixing (not re-mastering) the crucial live efforts, SEX MACHINE & REVOLUTION OF THE MIND, APOLLO VOL. III. Eighteen years since the one and only ""official"" Compact-Disc delivery of these heavily-sampled, though poorly mixed, sets.[Review based upon Amazon ""samples""]."
5,Fits some 2004 Hyundai Santa Fe's,"I have a 2004 Hyundai Santa Fe with a production date of July 2003. Contrary to what people say about the headlight assembly change happening AFTER March, the ""newer"" headlights were not the proper fit. THESE TYC's (older assembly for 2001-2003) fit perfectly. Please make sure to check the back of your current headlights to see what the headlight assemblies look like, this will save you the trouble of finding the perfect fit if you are like me and have a 2003-04 Santa Fe and aren't sure.What a difference it made in the appearance of my car...the original ones were so yellow that I literally had ZERO visibility at night.I am very happy with my purchase and glad I was able to overnight them with Amazon! :) Save a few hundred bucks by buying these aftermarket, the install is super easy! :)"
4,The Christmas Nightmare,"The book I read was The Christmas Rat,Eric wasthe main character in this story.The biggest problem in this story is that Anje[Anjela] is trying to kill Eric's little furry friend.Eric lived in a nice apartment but suddenly his apartment gets disrupted by Anje.Every living rodent and insect in his apartment is destroyed except for the christmas rat.My favorite part in this book was when Eric's dad found out that Anje wasn't apart of the exterminating buisness.And that's when Anje Wanted to watch the rodent die.This was a very good book and was writtenby a very good author,Avy."
1,"""I smell a Rat""","I'm sorry, but I was really mad that I spent good money on this book. The story goes no where slowly. I forced my way through to the end hoping it would get better, it didn't. I have really loved some of AVI's other books, Poppy, The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle, but I wouldn't recommend this book to an enemy. Save your money."
5,Super!,One of the best original movie scores ever written. A perfect match for the story line of the movie. This music stands alone as a classical piece of music. One of Poland's best kept secrets!
5,Fast and efficient,"The plates came in a few days, very well packed. I am very pleased with Amazon.com service (and plates are exactly as expected)."
1,Lacking,"The bio had alot of ""facts"" but it did not show us how she really felt. There is a snobbish tone to the life story of Mrs. Teddy. I don't think she was in fact that snobbish."
5,Excellent Bio read,"Loved this book, read it twice, very intimate, not just a bunch of political facts and dates, you really get to know Edith and the Roosevelts, loved it."
4,"Educational, if not always insightful","I read this biography as a companion to ""The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt"" and ""Theodore Rex"" -- partly because I wanted a different perspective, and partly because I wanted to know what happened to Theodore after 1908 and volume III of his biography isn't likely to be out in the near future. In the end I am glad I read the book, and I learned a great deal more about President Roosevelt and his family -- but I think for the serious or dedicated history buff you must also read the aforementioned books to get a more detailed, nuanced view of the Roosevelts' life and the times in which they lived.Morris's writing varies markedly from section to section, perhaps due to inconsistent editing rather than her own writing."
2,region,Keep the region code in mind! I definitely bought this without even thinking about the different region for each dvd player bs.
4,28 Days Later/28 Weeks Later,"I actually liked the 28 Weeks Later bettre than the original 28 Days Later. If you like gut wrenching gorey action, this is the movie for you. There seemed to be more of an overall plot with the second movie, and a little less tense gore."
4,28 Weeks Later / 28 Days Later,"Frankly, I think it's an excellent addition to Zombie lore and stands alone in some respects. Especially for the first one, the story-telling is quite well done. Didn't take long to ship, either."
5,GOOD movies and package!!!!,"PERFECT for Halloween,leave a light on while watching these mpives is my BEST advice. ; )"
1,28 days/weeks later,I ordered this item expecting 28 days later and 28 weeks later and I received 2 copies of 28 days later. Very disappointed.
3,"cd1 brings, but cd 2...not quite","Hate to give Hernan 3 stars, coz I really like this DJ, he's one of the few new bloods that actually stays true to his style, got a chance to see him live last year and he delivered! anyway back to the review...great mellow progressive house overall, an especially essential compilation for your upcoming summer road trips. Cd1 is vintage Hernan, great track selection, great track progression, and flawless mixing asusual, this CD has the flavour of the Renaissance 2 compilation, and by itself is well worth the purchase. CD2 on the other hand falls short, Hernan not only fails to develop some sort of rhythm or ""storyline"" on this cd, but he also drifts from his classic prog beats into the murky waters of techy house, were the music begins to sound more or less the same. Ultimately a great buy, fans wont be disappointed by CD1 especially, CD2 just didnt do it for me."
3,a bit disappointed,I was hoping for something similar to Renaissance 2... It started off like it was goign to be good but then dropped off with the grooves becoming banging and not very pleasing to the ear. The smooth progressive grooves and mixing of R2 are nowhere to be found. Perhaps it's just that there hasn't been as much good progressive lately but still its a let down. Hernan can be best out there but i don't like this style.
4,Its about time!!!!!!!,"This CD is worth every penny, it is just what I have been looking for a while!! The last two Renaissance Masters series that Hernan recorded were good but not as great as the Perfecto Presents Latin America. This album is as good as Latin America. Both CDs flow perfectly from start to finish. Deep base lines and house rythms all throughout."
5,Holy Sh|T the house master has spoken,"Wow Hernan Cattaneo rocks.I have only listened to this album 2 times so this album has still to grow on me.But disc 2 was so amazing that hands down this album deserves 5 stars; this is the first house album that has gave me a trippy feeling and do I just love that.Disc 1 for wasn't that great and I don't like to talk about albums that much since I only heard it twice but disc 2 is worth the 20 bucks.We all knew that trance was where the magic happened when we heard the DJ Tiesto series of Magik but now Hernan is showing the house music where the magic will open.Buy This Disc and be shocked this is some real house music, and for those that want to find real house/techno music buy this.P.S. Trance ain't techno get that straight Americans!"
5,Words cant explain how good this cd is,If you love house you will love this cd.It's a truly jaw droping mix. If you think you know all styles of house then your missing out if you dont get this cd.What would the world do without dj's? They bring us all the best music that those genius artists make. like the 16 bit lolitas man they really know their stuff.Thanks Hernan.
1,"Not Funny (the best ones barely register a ""guffaw""). Yes, It's that bad.","I had high hopes about this book, especially after reading all of the reviews below. I expected some funny and insightful observations about the current political climate (lord knows, there's enough material), but I was very very disappointed. It's plum boring. Stick with the onion.com.His ""satire"" rarely makes you laugh. I am politically conservative so I was hoping for some funny articles to send my liberal friends but I found myself thumbing through hoping each successive article would be worthy of sharing. Alas, I found nothing.If anyone wants to purchase a used copy, I'm sure there will be plenty used ones. I'm using mine for toilet paper."
4,Uriah Heep Classic Heavy Rock Monsters Live on!,Uriah Heep is one of the founders of heavy keyboard rockbut like Deep Purple don't get the credit they deserve.But they are one of those bands that continue to play &make albums that people buy so real rock fans know whothey are! I got this after seeing the bonus dvd on thecelebration cd which blew me away! I am a big Heep fanof the Byron era and nothing can replace that but thisis a great dvd with great new songs and Mick Box theoriginal guitarist is still one of the greatest of alltime and the original drummer Lee Kerslake [who gainedweight and now having health issues] God bless him ishere playing his butt off! The concert also has classicmaterial and makes this a must for Heep or Heavy Rockfans! The band is awesome! I highly recommend this dvd!
4,Bizarro,"first I will start with Simon Logan's The Decadent Return of The Hi-fi Queen. The visionary the author comes along strong, but to keep the reader interested he lost me. The queen returns and demands her crew to fight off the Felidae. Overall I give 2in a half stars.Carlton Mellick bizarre mind takes us into a dark fantasy Where he creates his very own girlfriend. Turns out to be a sex fiend. They battle zombies to the end with a Bizarro ending. Overall some laughs and strange stuff you suspect from CMIII. 5 STARS!"
3,Get this for Mellick's Story,"Carlton Mellick III gives us his own interpretation of ""Frankenhooker"" mixed with Terry Gilliam style surrealism. Zombies, gore, sex, and machine people are all here for your reading enjoyment. While the story is exciting and engaging, it does not seem to have the depth I normally associate with Mellick's works. Not to say there isn't subtext, there are some interesting ideas on the power the female body can hold and the consumption of men (a common theme to Mellick), but it does not seem as fully explore as in ""Razor Wire Pubic Hair,"" or ""the Haunted Vagina."" If your new to Mellick, get one of the other books I mentioned to give him a try. If you're already a Bizarro fan, make sure you take the time to read this unique zombie tale."
5,Great deal for $20,"I hooked these up to my Xbox 360 and was pleasantly surprised for the money.The bass response is very impressive, and the left right separation is also surprisingly good. The L/R separation is the best feature, as you can really hear the difference between front right, dead right and rear right. Walking past something in a game and hearing it sweep along you is really well done. When the sound sweeps behind or in front it's not a smooth transition. The simulated rear and center front are workable, but not convincing (not a replacement for physical speakers).Overall I'd say the sound is comparable to a set of the lower line Sennheiser over the ear phones."
1,Worst Purchase ever!!!,"This set of headphones was a complete waste of time. Do not buy this if you expect 5.1 surround sound as it states. The headphones do not produce this effect and the sound quality is absolutely horrible at every thing possible. The sound is muffled and when the sound is traveling from one side to the other it cuts in and out; sound basically disappears for a second which was annoying. The rear was absolutely silent, I heard nothing. Just in case your wondering I ran several surround sound test on this device through the optical input and it was disappointing. I tried several settings giving them a chance but no luck at reproducing the surround sound effect. Also the headphones have a weird connector so your not going to be able to use them on anything but the decoder. I hope this helps anyone in the future. Have a nice day ; )"
1,Don't waste the money,"I purchased these to test the surround headphones theory. They were quite the disappointment. They sound particularly bad when watching movies. The dialogue sounds muffled and distant, as if you are hearing it through a tank of water. In a pinch, the phones work acceptably for gaming. With the digital out cable, there is enough separation of sound to get a sense of direction, but the volume levels of particular channels aren't adjustable, so it's not a substitute for a normal room system. I used these for Socom Confrontation and COD 4 on the PS3. It was generally difficult to tell how close sounds were coming from. In general, I'd say save the 20 bucks that you would waste on these and save for a higher quality pair. If you don't agree, I'd be happy to sell you mine."
3,Cyberhome CH-SRD 600R 6-channel Surround Headphones with Game Decoder,"At the time I purchased these, they were on sale for about $30.00 each, so I bought a couple sets for my kids to try on the XBOX 360. They said they were ok but does not have true surround, so don't expect too much from these for gaming. They do however have good sound when hooking them up to an MP3 player."
2,"Nice,cheap but sharp sound","pros:comfort,Optical,2 headphones(I think),long wires(the headphone only),chargeable,strong sound and good qualitycons:Sharp sound(May hurt your ear and maybe this won't make it everyday use),Not that good surround(Maybe I don't test it well),NO USB,volume control is too far from the headset,the decoder is not that small with few featuresI didn't hear that surrounded system EVEN with the optical.It's still Good headset With this priceDon't Expect something the same with Headphones with 100$"
3,"An okay product, but it's $17.","The pros and cons list from Michael P. was pretty spot on, but I'm going to do my own.Pros:- It's $17 (I paid $10).- Comes with TOSLINK and coaxial cable, plus headphone bag.- Option for battery or plugged-in usage.- Pretty decent surround effect and good full sound during loud scenes.- Pretty comfortable, and they block out a fair amount of external noise.Cons- Lots of cables- No DTS support at all. It won't push out any sound whatsoever.- Significant hissing. It reminds me of the old days of bad analog receivers.- Very poor highs. It sounds like their speaking underwater.I'd buy it all over again, but only because it's so cheap. Any more money, and I'd say no way."
3,You Get What You Pay For...,"I picked these up because $25, shipping included, seemed like a good deal, even if they weren't very good. Well... They're not very good. The options are nice, and if the quality was better, it'd be great. But the difference between ""muted"" and one level up from mute on the volume is like deaf vs. deafening. Even with the optical, there seems to be a lot of strange hiss corresponding to rear channel sounds. The bass is very heavy, as noted elsewhere, but I wouldn't mind that if I could ""turn it down a bit""... Unfortunately, there's nothing between 'off' and 'headsplitting', at least when used with my XBox 360, which is a little problematic."
5,Moment of Truth by Da T.R.U.T.H,"I purchased this CD for my middle school son. He loves it. It is ""safe"" music with great beats and even better messages. I have enjoyed this CD as well."
1,Moment of Truth........,"I love Da Truth music but the cd I received was cracked, had some scratches along with finger prints on it. So as I wasn't 100% satisfied with the cd. The price was good, so I guess you get what you pay for."
4,CD a good Buy,"The Truth formally part of the group Cross Movement. Comes out with his first full length cd Moment of Truth. This CD is pretty good. It has God based lyrics with a tight beat. If your looking for the best in christian rap here it is. Crossmovement also does a song with their ""young boy"" and its one of my favorites on the cd the songs called ""jesus anthem"". Crossmovement Da Truth reppin the name of Jesus and at the same time comin' with some nice rhymes."
2,meh,"So the bike was easy to assemble...that's about the only good thing so far.I took it for a ride the day after I put it together. A few miles out I realized something was wrong with the gears. So I took the bike into the shop for a complete tune-up. (They also told me there that the manufactuerer had put the brakes on backwards.) After spending the 60 bucks on that, I thought I was set to go. I haven't even gotten a chance to ride it yet because when I got it back home, the front tire decided just to blow out while sitting in my driveway. *I'd like to note that I was not sitting on the bike and even if I were, I'm not a big person so it couldn't have been my weight that made the blowout occur.* The bike shop offered to fix that for free even though it totally wasn't their fault.I wanted an inexpensive road bike and now I realize I should have spent a little more and gotten something that doesn't fall apart before I even ride it."
2,See review under men's GMC road bike,"In short: went to wrong house and left there- took 4 weeks to arrive, well, 3 weeks(it was at my neighbors for 1 week. Had to buy 2 intertubes because manufacturers deffect. Haven't been on the road yet...we'll see. It's a pretty bike besides all that. Hope it rides just as well."
3,Mediocre,"This was my first road bike but I rode into the ground. I've easily put 600-700 miles on it in three months and it's ready to be retired. The pedals make an clicking sound and the gears don't change well. In fact, my chain tends to fall off from time to time.I would recommend this bike to someone who is using it to commute short distances because it does ride well around town. I'm 5'5 and it fits me well.Competitive bikers, look elsewhere. For the average rider, it's about middle of the road, but it'll get the job done."
1,Missing parts,The bike came with in a week! That was great! It is worth what I paid for it. However it did not come with all of the nuts that it required. I had to go salvage some to complete my assembly.
2,the big problem,"The bike in general is good, everything works, easy assembly, my big problem are the tires, i get a flat tire AT LEAST ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK!!!!!!!, OMG!!!, i need the bike, but this is imposible, i dont know what to do!."
5,back to my adolescence,"Surprised at how well these stories hold up. I remember ""La Strega"" from my adolescence and there is not a lot else that still is around from the age of 14. Thanks to Image for making this available."
2,"""THRILLER"" MUSIC TRACK WAY TOO LOUD ON THIS SERIES","PLEASE HELP!!!! I just received THRILLER - FAN FAVORITES. The music track on the first episode ""THE GRIM REAPER"" I have watched is way too loud. It way over powers the voice track. Does anybody know if this is the way it is throughout the whole series. I do not want to buy this series where I will always have to be adjusting the volume up and down. I mean the music is WAY, WAY too loud. The picture is FANTASTIC and the music track when heard is very FULL and RICH sounding, but way too loud. Has anybody else experienced this problem or know if this problem has been corrected?"
5,Fantastic Horror and Suspense Classic,First I would like to thank my brother (Richard Arnold of Lynchburg Va.) for hisrecommending this item to me. I ordered it and I got it at a good price. The sellerhad it on sale. I finally finished watching all my videos and I was quite happywith the item. The DVDs had no flaws. The stories were excellent. The story lineswere quite good and Boris Karloff is a good host. His introduction and the way hedid his introduction really added to the show. I won't go into describing theindividual stories because I believe others have already done that. I will say thatthe stories are a mix of suspense and horror and those who helped produce thisseries did an outstanding job and deserve much credit. I'm hoping some of them arestill around. Also Amazon did it's usual good job of getting the item to me in it'susual timely manner. Again good job.
2,Boring,"To think that I actually watched this show when it was on TV. Obviously my taste has changed since then, changed for the better I hope. The commentary can be summed up merely by saying that the show was not titled accurately. Calling a show a thriller and having it introduced by Boris Karloff does not make it so.The plots are shallow. The acting is mundane. The actors, for the most part, were unknowns who never progressed. Avoid this. There's better stuff."
5,Classic TV at its Best,These shows are Great to have. Boris Karloff as host and occasional performer is quality personified. Thanks for offering this set at a Great price.
5,Thriller,"This TV show used to scare me as a child. I remember listening to the music when it came on. Even the music was scarry. My parents watched it every week. Now, I want to be able to relive my childhood fears with a smile as I watch the episodes. Boris Karloff was off the hook!!!!"
4,Thriller: The Complete Series,"While I liked some episodes better than others, I am very happy that the entire series has been made available to the general public."
4,A Great Show But ...,"This is a great show but I have to agree with some of the others that the music is too loud. The picture quality is excellent and the sound is clear but the music is a bit ""booming"". If you like Twilight Zone, Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Outer Limits, One Step Beyond, etc. than you'll like this one."
3,The LOUD audio kills this set !,"I just shelled out $75.00 for this box set - - and I read almost all the reviews listed here about it from others. First of all, I am half way done watching all the episodes - - and there are some dogs in here....but there also some pretty good ones, too. The scenes & episodes with Boris Karloff is worth the entire $75.00 alone ! Seriously - he is THAT good !But what absolutely DESTROYS this box set is how awful the audio is. You'll be watching it and everything will seem fine...then, a minute later when the music starts in IT GETS SO LOUD that you literally climb out of your skin ! The audio is so high that it wakes the dead ! The episodes with screaming in them....your heart will actually stop because of the how loud it is and it about scares the devil out of you !!! It got so loud that it woke up my entire family....and they are clear on the other side of the house sleeping !Most of the movies are very cool ! But the sound is JUST AWFUL !"
1,They Forgot One Thing,"Good program, nicely restored image, plenty of bonus features--and no subtitles or CC. So tough luck if you're hearing impaired."
2,I didn't find what I was looking for.,I didn't find what I was looking for.I didn't find what I was looking for.I didn't find what I was looking for.
3,"Well played, but lacking in power","This is strangely subdued and soft-edged for Bernstein. Granted, the Peer Gynt suites aren't The Rite of Spring, but I was still expecting more fire from Bernstein (which he does find on the brief March of the Trolls). The Sibelius suffers similar problems. The Valse Triste is almost inaudible at times; more boring than sad. The Swan of Tuonela is very well played, particularly the cellos and basses, though again something is lacking. It is certainly atmospheric, but not really eerie or unsettling as I feel it should be. The Finlandia is brought down by the bland brass playing. Check out the Ashkenazy version of this piece, where the horns sound like they are going to rip your head off. In conclusion, this is of interest to fans of the works, particularly at mid-price, but I don't think this will make the music any new fans."
4,"Works, but a bit too thin","I purchased this product to hook my Xbox 360 to my Creative Labs Audigy2 ZS. I've successfully set up my Xbox 360 to output Dolby Digital into my computer and then into my speakers.The cable works. You can see the light coming out the other end when it's hooked up to my Xbox 360. I haven't encounter any problems with it and it's worked flawlessly since I purchased it.The only complaint I have with it is that the wire is a bit thin, though I guess that was expected from the title of this product, though it was thinner then I expected. I don't know exactly how thick the wire is, but if I had to guess, the diameter would be about 2mm.There's nothing wrong with being thin. I just feel that I melt accidentally snap it or something, but so far it's been pretty sturdy."
1,PRIME CUSTOMERS- AVOID THIS SELLER!! HORRIBLE DELIVERY!,"Ordered item 11/30 via Amazon Prime (2 day shipping guaranteed) & after not receiving on 12/2 per Prime agreement, wrote Amazon to complain & order was resubmitted on 12/2, but despite this, the cable still didn't arrive until the evening of 12/6...SIX DAYS AFTER ORDERING!!While I wasn't expecting a ""monster quality"" cable given the cheap price, I still would have expected something more substantial than a wire about as thick as hard kite string! Good thing this piece of crap works considering the HORRIBLE delivery time and fact that seller offered no explanation or apology for their error.Amazon needs to drop this seller from PRIME delivery immediately as they are a disgrace to their service. Do yourselves a favor and DO NOT BUY from these sellers because they're flat out HORRIBLE!!StarTech.com THINTOS10 10 feet Toslink Digital Optical SPDIF Audio Cable"
2,Barely Adequate,"Product shipped at the last minute, arrived at the last date in the window. Not late. Optical cables are simple, this one is sub par. One end is malformed, but passes digital signals. Not reliable at staying in optical port. Do not recommend this provider."
2,"Worked for a week, then quit","The only reason I am giving this a 2 star is because customer service was so nice when we went to return the product. I guess you get what you pay for with this product. Had it to hook my stereo to the TV and it worked perfectly for about a week, then the family sat down to watch a movie and boom, no sound. Refunded with no problems and the sellers were very quick to respond and help me with everything. Time to try another cable!"
3,Too thin!,"I currently have this product connecting a wall-mounted TV to a soundbar. Although it has worked since i got it, I will not buy this product again. I can't envision any time where i will need that extra 1/16th inch diameter of space saved as a compromise for quality compared to other far better built toslink cables available on amazon.Pros:Sound quality so far has been fine. No dropouts. I think with digital it either works or it doesn't.Not susceptible to EM interference. It's not like you're gonna get reduced audio quality or static buzz from an inferior optical cable.Cons:Product feels cheap and flimsy. I was scared I was going to kink it.The connectors don't really feel snug in place when attached.Bottom line? there's better ones out there."
5,An amazing piece of technology,"This is kind of a must to buy if you own a Home Theater system that is capable of taking digital signal transmitted from an optic fiber cable.If you own a mac, you already have the headphone jack allowing you to transmit a red lighted signal (I'm not sure, but this is what I have heard...).If you own a PC, you might want to check. I own an old dv6000 laptop which has one of its headphones jack doubling as an SPDIF port to transmit the red lighted signal for digital audio.This item allows you to connect your home theater system with your TV, or your home theater with your laptop."
4,Excellent reading.,The Book is exactly correct on what needs to be done. I wonder if Stock Brokers really do all of these things.
5,Outstanding!,"This performance of the classic ""New World"" symphony, in my opinion, is the best available. First of all, the remastering is outstanding, the performance is absolutely complete (following all the composer's 'repeat' indications in the score (something rarely heard or adhered to). The only thing I find to be somewhat disappointing (although really not a complaint) is Bernstein's breakneck tempi; this is a pet-peeve of mine applicable to almost every present-day or recent conductor. Slow it down man! This recording is so far the only one I'd recommend to new listeners. BRAVO"
4,For Bernstein Fans,"This is a very good recording of Dvorak 9. It is not the best that I have heard (I can recall a late Karajan and especially the late 50s Szell/Cleavland SO) but Berntsein, the quintessential American conductor, very aptly caputres the spirit of this, a quintessential American symphony. I simply don't feel that Bernstein dedicated his whole self into making this the perfect recording. I can say this honestly because I've heard him come as close to perfection as is possible in several other recordings however I simply do not feel that energy here.This is a very good recording, top 10 percentile, but it is neither the best example of Dvorak's work nor the best example of Bernstein's work."
1,MP3 OF DVORAK'S SYMPHONY NO. 9 TOO DISTORTED!,"I downloaded the Dvorak Symphony No. 9 along with the Carnival Overture and two Slavonic Dances on December 30, 2009. The MP3 files were way too distorted to be enjoyed, mainly on the louder passages. I have looked through Amazon's web site for a way to complain to Amazon but they have hidden too well any kind of support. Don't download this recording!"
5,A fascinating account!,"Having read a huge number of books on Nazi Germany and the Second World War, I often find that, despite my interest in the subject, the stories become repetitive. Not so with ""In Hitler's Germany"". Englemann's unusual viewpoint of a liberal young man during the Third Reich and his combination of his own life story and the stories of others he knew makes for a book that is very difficult to put down. The book is both humerous and extremely serious, but most of all, it is amazing. The quiet resistance of Englemann and some of his friends reads like a fictional account, but, of course, it's true. I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone with even a passing interest in World War II. My only problem with the book was that it was over too soon!"
5,Perfect!,"I brought this watch to me wife for anniversary and she was so happy, it is the perfect gift. Try it you will not regret."
3,Beautiful but the bracelet is not good--easy to lose,"I bought two of those--one for myself (gold one) and the other one(silver) as a gift for my niece. The bracelet on mine was too large and it didn't lock well--had to send to the repairshop, the warranty doesn't cover that. Paid about $40 incl. shipping. They offered to chage the whole bracelet for $70+...But I don't wear that watch, so it's sitting in the jewellery box --I like my Movado watch better- it has much better lock...My niece lost her watch last month because the lock was not safe (that's after a year and a half of wearing the watch).Overall, it's a beautiful watch but the bracelet starts showing the signs of wear after several months and the lock is not safe."
5,"Penetrating, absorbing study of history of mental retardation","Generous and substantial in both scope and depth, this illuminating study offers a detailed history of mental retardation in the United States and how the condition was perceived and addressed through time. Charting the course from small 1850s schools offering individualized instruction to the large institutions of the late 19th century, this thoroughly researched book gives the reader an engrossing sociological account. As a non-academic layman interested in societal attitudes towards marginalized populations, I read it with great interest as a work of history, and also return to it from time to time as a reference. I haven't yet found a better book on this subject."
2,I found this book quite interesting but very technical,"I had to read this book for a report for school. Otherwise, I would have never picked it up. It took me a long time to get through the book, because I found it to be quite technical. However, it was fascinating to find out what these people went through. It's scary to think that there actually was a comittee that was set up in 1914 with the sole purpose of irradicating the mentally retarded from this world!!"
3,3 IN THE ATTIC,"This movie could have been a potentially good coming of agemovie with a very capable cast. However, the VHS copy deleted a lot of the scenes which took place in the attic.(I suspect it was a copywright issue.)I felt the removal of these scenesdetracted from the essence of the movie.Point of Information: If I could find an ""uncut"" VHS version of ""3 In the Attic"" I would purchase that copy in a heartbeat.Neal Bracken"
4,intelligent writing,"This novel was intelligently written as are all the Simeon Grist stories. I always learn something from them (sometimes with a dictionary). This time it touched on fire symbolism in religions with a little bit of mythology thrown in. That just added to the story, not detracted from it. The characters were ""real"" people. I thought ""Incinerator"" was not as good as ""Skin Deep"" but it was still a great mystery and I liked it."
5,"The descriptive ability is, I believe, unsurpassed","I'm reminded again as I finish the Incinerator that Timothy Hallinan has some very rare and unique writing skills.His unique descriptive ability sets him apart from other top tier mystery writers. His characters are wonderfully described, brought to life, whereas some highly respected writers only focus on actions with some brief thoughts of their cast thrown in. Timothy's descriptions, both animate and inanimate such as surroundings, are vivid, inventive and imaginative with a keen sense of humor to go with it. I have no idea how he does it.The point is that Hallinan has a real, rare talent not found within the works of some with whom we're familiar. They're very good also, but lack this skill of Hallinan's.The Incinerator is very well written, good characters, and definitely and consistently entertaining. The man has quite a sense of humor, and his descriptions are simply inspired."
3,Nobody else can tell this story about Oswald!,"This fascinating account of Oswald's attempt to go to Cuba can be told by no other writer. Oswald went to Mexico City 7 weeks before the JFK assassination and tried to get a visa to go to Cuba. The Cuban Consulate said they could not issue such a visa on such short notice and suggested he go to the Russia Consulate. He did and had an encounter with Comrade Oleg Nechiporenko that explains Oswald's attempts to manipulate authorities. Oswald tried to solve his feelings of insignificance by coaxing Russian authorities to let him have a visa to go to Russia via Cuba and tried to demonstrate his affiliation with communism. He also pulled a gun and explained that he had to carry it because of persecution by the FBI. Nechiporenko recounts Oswald's manipulations, instability, and desperation in a way that no other person has ever done. This book should be re-issued for the general public to understand Oswald."
4,Good read!,"Love Joe Wambaugh's writing style and humor. He tells a great story. He left a few details hanging at the end of this one, which i think would have finished up the story in a better way. Overall, a very good read."
3,This was ok,"I like Joseph Wambaugh's books, he tends to write in a humourous manner and does sometimes have a point to make in his books. I don't think he has ever topped his first three books but I don't think he is trying to write like he did back then, he is writing lighter fare now.In Finnegan's Week, we get to meet Fin Finnegan who is a wanna-be actor but mainly a San Diego Police Detective. His task is to work out what happened with a routine truck theft case. He gets to meet two female cops and the crime gets messy along with his private life.The novel is quite a good read, it flows well and there are some witty passages but I felt very little was gripping me to love this book. I was reading it because of Wambaugh's classic past books, but if this novel was written by another novelist who I was not aware of, I would have probably given up on it.Buy this book if you are a diehard fan but otherwise skip it."
1,Been there; done that,"Nothing new, interesting or exciting about this book. Just a re-work of a lot of previous books. Clearly time to move on to other authors."
3,Brutally Honest,"You've got to hand it to a man who admits if he could do it all over again, he would still oppose Jackie Robinson breaking the color barrier. And who uses his autobiography to mention he sold prescription drugs to inmates when he was a guard.As offensive as his stances and actions are, you know you're not getting any pretenses with this guy. Higbe had only a seventh-grade education, so he had plenty of help from Martin Quigley in sounding eloquent, and Quigley does a good job there.This isn' t a groundbreaking work, but it is a quick, enjoyable read."
2,Very poor UI,"This player is pretty bad! It's UI and controls are very unfriendly. Once you learn how to use it, you will probably be fine. Keep the manual handy as you will need to go back to it lots of times. Consumes battery a lot."
2,Not good for proper tempering,"I bought this for chocolate as I have tempered chocolate before using a double boiler and this seemed easier. When melting it says it will melt up to a pound of chocolate but you are only supposed to fill the bowl to a certain line and when it melts you have about a third of a bowl of chocolate not a full bowl as picture shows. It formed tiny lumps before it melted and after it cooled to 85 I poured into molds. It never set fully, most stuck in the molds and others went crumbley. Instructions have you melt and cool to 85 only, nothing about cooling and then reheating to 85 as it says on this site. I also melted some yogurt coating which worked fine other than the fact you could only fill to a certain line although you could keep adding as it melted. Good for kids maybe or just for coatings but not to temper real chocolate."
5,Awesome for dinners @ restaurants,"This very small game will bring in all dinner guests - it's a quick, easy to learn game of imagination. We take it with us everywhere we go - restaurants, doctor's offices, etc. Any time you have to wait, whip this little ring of cards out and let your imagination go. My 3 year old loves it just as much as the 6 year old. They can always come up with something to answer the challenge. Such an excellent game I'm ordering a new one since we've lost our old one."
1,I agree with Mr. Giuliano...,"Without having read the book, I can fully agree with Mr. Giuliano's review because I've lived in Tripoli for one year. Libya is all that Mr. Giuliano has written about and more. Streets strewn with plastic bags of all sizes and ages (yes, plastic doesn't seem to rot!), Libyans trying and sometimes succeeding in tricking and cheating you, a total lack of any restaurant that resembles a restaurant. The only place I ever ate at was in a foreigners' camp and most of the time I had Yalla (Montezuma's Revenge) shortly thereafter. Unfortunately I have few fond memories that I have taken with me. I have lived in many countries, some comparable to Libya, but none has left me more disgusted and disappointed than Libya and its hypocrisy. Without the plastic bags and rotting cans, I am sure it could be a beautiful place. I just wasn't shown the pretty places."
5,A Graphic Novel Masterpiece,"Tales of the Slayers is an amazing piece of work. A variety of stories by different authors, most of whom have written episodes for the Buffy television series. Although each story portrays very different slayers in different time periods, the whole book fits together very well, with a very appropriate prologue and an extremely surprising finale (both of these written by Joss Whedon) that gives you a sense of closure even though the tales are vastly different. Another strength of this book is that the art work for each tale is from different artists, which provides for vastly different moods and styles. I have been reading comics for 25 years -- I have never seen such a beautifully presented piece of work!"
4,Loved it,The stories where great but the book was rather short. They could have waited and simply added the other Slayer stories. Beyond that Top Notch writing.
2,these 'tales' are barely anecdotes,"While it's fun to imagine the Slayer in her various incarnations, this volume at a slim 80 pages, took me about 15 minutes to read, and was a very light slayer snack- at best.The stories are short, some of them are boring & it is certainly NOT worth the money!Not recommended!"
2,Disappointing,"The book was very short and sparse, despite the good writers listed. There are some wonderful graphic novels out lately, but this wasn't one of them. I'm a huge fan, but this was lacking the cleverness, surprises, and plot of the series.The book contains a few short (very short - a couple of pages each) little vignettes of the lives of several slayers. None are particularly interesting, creative, or engrossing. I'd skip it and look for something else. You won't find the slayer-style you love here.See the review by Hardman - she's nailed the problem."
2,Kinda disappointed!,"This video simply wasn't interesting to watch. The music material itself is just ""average"" and somewhat dated; It doesn't compare to their last project/release ""My Purpose"" from many years ago. I still love and listen to that CD today. I guess I was expecting something on that level. What a let down..."
3,"Review of the Album ""Return""","The Anointed Paces Sisters is a Group I love to hear! When I walked in the Gospel Record Store to find they had a new album I was extremely excited that they had returned. However, as I listened to the CD I was disappointed again the same as with their 2003 release of 'It's Already Done'. I'm not sure what has happened with them, but this album does not match their first two albums which were both highly anointed and spirit filled which brought me back to them for this purchase. Durnice continues to deliver in 'It's Already Done', and thank God for them letting LaShun guest solo on this Album. She is a sister and should always be included as God has truly blessed her with the gift to sing. Melonda is my third favorite singer after Durnice and her cut on here was okay, but I was looking for something more on the order of 'His Spirit is in this Place' off of their second Album. God bless the Pace Sisters and may they continue to uplift the name of the Lord!"
4,Excellent Supplement,I just picked up this book and read through it. It has so much information in it it's hard to know where to start. If you want magicians in your Champions game that do more than throw fireballs and put up force shields this book will be a great help. If you want to introduce cults and magic into a horror or pulp game this book will give youall sorts of ideas on rituals and how low powered magic can work.
5,The new reporters friend. A must read!,"After reading ""On Camera"", by Nancy Reardon and Tom Flynn, I want to report this is the first time I have seen so many anchoring and reporting lessons and learning techniques in such a consise and easy to follow format. Not only was the book itself enlightinging but the added DVD gives real, honest and practical advice which anyone will come away from with more basic and professional skills.This new book should be a ""must read"" for anyone studying ""On Camera"" television or video reporting, from the student to the still learning reporter. And aren't we all still learning.Hightly recommended.Jackson M"
4,very good!,i ordered this cd from amazon and it was great! got here fast and in the very condition that it said it would be in. i would use amazon and this provider again.
4,great cd,under rated cd...everything buckcherry puts out is really good!!the last song on here which is not listed is awesome!!!!
5,GHI International Season 1,"Ghost Hunters International is a great show and I am delighted that the 1st season has finally been released and I look forward to the release of Season 2. The places they visit all over the world are fascinating also provides a nice introduction to cultures, cities with centuries of history to places I never heard of. The fact that this team functions by the same principles as TAPS, their findings are valid, well documented and always informative,especially, for us who have had our own paranormal experiences.SB"
3,Still no blu-rays for International?,I was hoping that since Ghost Hunters season 6 was released on blu-ray that furter seasons of it along with International would be on blu. I'm disapointed to see season two of GHI only coming out on dvd. Makes me think GH season 6 may be the only season we get on blu-ray. I hate it when tv shows try one or two seasons on blu-ray and then go back to just standard dvd.
1,Don't waste your money,"If I could give this ZERO STARS I would. This has to be one of the most horrific paranormal shows on television today. Don't waste your time or money. See for yourself! Watch just one episode on SYFY and you'll most definitely agree. The network should have stopped with the original (which, by the way, has really gotten boring in its own right). Someone here wrote how exciting it was when at the end of the show they do their so-called 'big reveal'. What big reveal? All that's ever talked about are personal experiences and noises that were heard. Needless to say, their 'evidence' is ALWAYS crap. Find something better to do with your time!"
1,WOAH - I wasted my money AND my time,"I wish I could give this book less than a star because even 1 star is too generous for this book. The first chapter is quick to cite the important points in working a room (points that you can learn from just any other book on conversation) and the rest is just nonsensical repetition of the same facts again and again. All in all, the book has too many flaws and a too little new material to be of any value."
2,Acceptable,"This book is written for idiots. I was hoping for something with a bit more meat to chew on. Very easy read, written in the manner of a motivational speaker. It does NOT layout strategies and tactics .. it is really only a pep talk to give someone the drive and courage to try."
1,Too Clinical,Oops! I purchased the audiobook. I forced myself to listen to the whole thing. RoAne is a clinician about small talk and spends way too much time on how to speak to different kinds of people. Good Gosh! She has so many rules I wonder how anyone would dare open his mouth? Why does she spend so much time on what men should say to women and what women should say to men? Come on! People are people. Let's not pigeon-hole according to sex. There are much more interesting differences in people.
4,Need more than this,"Susan has some good concepts about socializing, & especially her section about socializing online. That's a unique angle..."
2,"would make a good magazine article, but not a very good book.",There are many pages that are just completely wasted.
2,Common sense will get you just as far...,"Most of the book contains common sense ideas for working a room, ideas in which the average person already inherently knows and will act on without reading this book. Half of the time I was busy looking up the Yiddish terms in the Glossary and the other half of the time the author is trying to sell herself (I don't have to hear that you sell out arenas five times!) and her other books. Good thing I wasn't depending on this book to get me through working a room any time soon."
3,"Fun, quick read","This is a great book for a confidence booster, but the truth is that it deals more or less with etiquette as opposed to strategy for improving your interpersonal communication skills. For the 5 hours that it takes to read it, the book is worth the purchase, but it offers little insight as to how to overcome shyness, garner fortitude, and make the contacts you want at receptions and events you attend.This book is likely most valuable for people hosting receptions and mixers. RoAne offers a refresher course on how to properly introduce guests to one another, what not to say/ask/do to individuals you meet at a given event, etc. Essentially this book is a lesson in good manners which should precede any book on networking."
5,Helped get me out of my shell.,This is a good book for someone who can act on things. I was shy most of my life and worked hard to earn a degree from a good school only to fear talking to people soI sent back to work in a factory. I did not know how to switch gears and mix in a business setting or others where I did not know people. It really hurt and I was determined to get over this. I found this book over 12 years ago and really took it to heart and figured that I would try to do some of the things the author was talking about and just kept building for there. If you can learn from book and try to act on them within reason when you do not have the answers yourself then this book might help you. I give it to my up and coming staff as part of their development if I think it will help them in social/business setting. While I still have a big shy side no one reallyknows it unless I tell them and I speak on a pretty regualr basis to various business and other groups.
2,Mostly Fluff,"This book lacks the implementation details for the suggested ideas. I felt like I was at a lecture about how to socialize where only high level common sense ideas are presented, but the true nitty-gritty details are ignored. The author has good intentions, but I didn't get much out of this book."
3,A Solid Effort!,"Whether you're working a room at a cocktail party, a fund-raiser, a special event, or a reunion, or just standing in line at the grocery store, Susan RoAne has plenty of tips to help you lose your jitters and enjoy yourself. Stressing the business and social benefits of making lively conversation and having the ability to ""work the room,"" this book covers every stage of an event, from planning how you'll deal with it, to whether you should send a thank-you note afterwards. Written in a lively style, this book is a quick read that includes just enough anecdotes, and plenty of no-nonsense, though not subtle, tips. We at getAbstract recommend it to everyone who ever has to go anywhere, and wants to know how to make the most of it."
3,If you're new to networking if may be useful,"Who in business hasn't had to go to an event for work. Be it direct sales, networking or just keeping in touch. If this is a regular think for you then you'll find this book very useful. Although some of the chapters are common sense a reminder is always useful.Well worth a read for anyone new to network events or in sharping their business conversational skills and getting more out of eventsIt could have dedicated a chapter or two to the use of social networks and the wealth of information they offer. NLP (or what ever name you like to give it) in some form should have been included to round it out.A good starter book on the topic but needs more depth."
1,HAVE SOME RESPECT!!,HAVE SOME RESPECT FOR OUR AVOS!!HOW CAN YOU PORTAY THEM AS YOU DID?IT'S DISGUSTING AND YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THIS HAGGADAH!
5,A Must See,"I rented this movie from Netflix and ended up watching it twice in one weekend. This has everything anyone could possibly want: a good story, great acting, and creativity. The story was beautifully told. It pulled you in and took you on a heartfelt journey blending a families trials with the magical restoration of the fantastic being, Skelling. Tim Roth is truly captivating in his role as Skelling. He fully embodied the character. By the end of the story you believed in the owl man.I would recommend this movie as a must watch to anyone looking for a good quality movie. That being said, I do not want to pay $22 for a DVD, especially when the Blu-ray is only $23. I want this movie, but I will wait for the price to drop a little."
4,If you like quirky...,"This is a truly weird movie that makes no pretense at being otherwise. Its full meaning is so subtle, I'm not sure I completely grasped it. As an overview, ""Skellig"" is a beautiful, touching and fascinating movie, even if some of the pieces never seem to gel. For example, what's with all those insects, not only serving as Skellig's food, but making an appearance in the boy's school? And in the long run, who the heck is Skellig, anyway?I bought this because I'm a fan of John Simm, and although he's something of a background character, he delivers sympathetically and emotionally as always. Tim Roth, a fabulous actor, is predictably believable and great.Ultimately, this is an uplifting story, although it's a bit uncomfortable getting there. While I wouldn't put it at the top of my favorites list, it's worth a watch, if for nothing more than the good intentions it ultimately delivers."
4,Good Family Movie - Well Conceived and Acted,"We rented this on a whim, and thoroughly enjoyed it. The plot is simple and very well constructed, and the acting is believable. A very good family movie with a good message of giving, and caring for others. Worth the rental."
3,Kosher Cooking for Southern Tastes,"The authors attribute recipes to each of the Southern States individually & this is kinda cute. They also single out Shavuot & Sukkoth, I'm not sure why because last I heard, these are Jewish holidays & not states!I've only tried a couple of the recipes but, I must say, the Yummy Yam Kugel is definitely a winner. It's won rave reviews every time it's been served."
2,Lint Everywhere!!!,"I thought that this would be a ""cool"" bib. I'm sick of baby dinosaurs and other characters, however, this item catches every piece of lint or hair in your house/dryer. I do not recommend this bib as it looks horrible after the first washing. I'm so disappointed. I was expecting so much more :-("
4,Nice bib,"These bibs are nice, they do their job but smill like tires. The smell wears off a bit after a few washes but still kinda there. I would buy these again and would recommend them to a friend. Good quality!"
4,Smaller than I thought,"Built NY aregreat bibs. They don't stain, easy to wash, and keep clothes dry. This bib was alittle smaller than I expected. I'd say it was a juice bib size."
5,Awesome,"This is a great bib if you're baby is a drooler. Holds much more slobber than you're typical cloth bib. Plus, if you hang it up, it drys quickly and can be used...a great feature if you're away from home for the day."
4,This Bib saves the day,"I ordered these bibs for my 4 month old triplets, I own a few other NY Built products and was impressed with the quality of their products and these bibs are no exception. They keep my kids dry when feeding and from drooling. The only thing that would be nice is if they were adjustable for around the neck my one son is small and the bib sometimes does not protect under his chin and he can get wet from feeding. The bibs hand wash great and air dry quickly. I will be buying the next step up bib NY Built makes with the pocket. These bibs are worth trying."
3,The 21st Century Nonprofit: Remaking the Organization in the,"This is an exceptionally well written and concise book. Most, if not all of the facts and information in it is true."
4,Comfortable and quality build,"Nice rubberized handle. Hard to adjust to mid length, they tend to want to be all out or all in the slide. Overall very satisfied with the product."
1,Not the best interpretation of these pieces.,"I don't think that Bernstein did a good job with this piece. To me, he makes ""The Rites of Spring"" sound like cute Disney music. My first impression was ""It sounds like Stravinsky for Fantasia."" I like to hear Stravinsky played like the orchestra is on fire or going wild. I think it suites these pieces best. I would opt for a different version of the piece, one that doesn't take it lightly. Bernstein took the passion out of Stravinsky."
5,"A Great Conductor, Orchestra, Composer and Peice","Bernstein brilliantly conducted these two difficult works by stravinsky. Very well interpreted tempos and syncopations. The orchestra responds very well to him. The sound quality is superb, almost a shame that you can't hear the clapping at the end. Both peices deserve standing ovations, and I would hope that Sony could find more recordings of bernstein to release."
5,Powerful medicine,"Considering that this symphony caused an actual riot following its debut in Paris-1913, I'd say it's worth a place on every music collector's shelf. This may very well have been rock and roll's first thunderous percussive debut, and the audience at that time was completely unprepared for it, yet deeply moved by it. Even now, this piece haunts the listener for days if not weeks after hearing it."
3,Italian Happy Metal,"""RAISING FEAR developed out from the two Italian bands WAR TRAINS and HELREIDH and RAISING FEAR have (unfortunately) nothing to do with ARMORED SAINT (remember their classic 'Raising Fear'). You can easily recognize their Italian origin, though the band isn't too much into this Happy Metal thing. It rather reminds me of a mediocre GRAVE DIGGER clone, but the vocals can never keep up with a Chris Boltendahl.""The opener of the album sounds promising, it has a good structure and in the end, there are cool acoustic guitars...Then rules average material. 'Octasa' raises a bit hope, but the rest is just mediocre--not bad, but who needs an average copy of GRAVE DIGGER? Nobody, and I have no clue, why they furthermore rape the band's classic 'Angel Witch.' To cover this sanctuary song is nothing but blasphemy! And the horrible cover is then the next point. 'Mythos' is totally unnecessary!""--Online February 26, 2005"
2,boring arrangements,"Unlike his earlier CD's, this collection is dominated by too much orchestration and not enough piano. The whole experience is plain Boring!"
1,Trashed in 2 weeks,"I got a pair of these brand new at a local electronics store for $20 and thought I had a real bargain. I thought it worked well for the first few hours despite the buzzing background noise. Individual speakers tested out fine. Starting the second day, I started having problems with it. Sound would intermittently get cut off. I could only get it to work by lightly bending the inline module (the capsule-shaped 2inch module on the line to the headset, and not the square box with the battery). As time progressed, more bending required, and now they only work if constant pressure was on the module. I may have bought a defective product, but since the store doesn't allow returns I am scrapping it. I know I sound a bit bitter, but I just want to warn those who are looking to buy this product."
4,Methane lakes on Titan?,"Gorgeous, rich, sweeping, exceptionally dynamically rendered electronica that effectively captures the (imagined) ""feel"" of the Cosmos. Bhatia is unquestionably a master synthesist and composer. Yet ... I couldn't help thinking of Pink Floyd's early groundbreaking piece ""Interstellar Overdrive"", Vangelis's ""Egg"" (I think it is titled) and, for that matter, the classical composer Gustav Holst's ""Planets"", both of which somehow moved me more and seemed more authentically ""cosmic"". Perhaps the problem is that Bhatia's scores sound a bit too much like movie theme music and not standalone compositions; or perhaps the problem resides with me - I'm not as young and impressionable as I once was. I've heard some of Bhatia's earlier work, which I prefer. ""Interstellar Suite"" is all big screen music and I missed the rocky, edgy, uniquely bizarre dwarf planet character of what is surely ""out there""."
1,A non-thrilling thriller,"For true mystery aficionados, even those still drawn by the English village genre, this is a real disappointment. The ""sleuth"" is not much of one and little about her half-hearted investigations is either credible or interesting. The cast of characters is fairly large but one never learns enough about any of them to be particularly interested in which of them actually committed the Cotswold killings that are the subject of the story. I kept hoping V.I. Warshowski, or at least Miss Marple would appear. Cotswold villages and landscape might have provided a secondary reason for reading for those who like these (as I do). But the background is as poorly developed as the foreground and awkward writing and inadequate editing throughout lessened whatever enjoyment might have been taken from the ambiance."
2,Disappointing,"I am an avid reader and I love British ""cozies"". That said, I could barely make myself finish this book. The characters are not interesting, I got tired of hearing how ""beautiful"" the main character is and the mystery was uninspired."
1,Let's read a novel about what Thea thinks,"The majority of this novel is spent in Thea's head. It is not a place the reader actually wants to be. Thea's thoughts ramble down aimless bunny trails, jump to disconnected conclusions, and generally go round and round and round. Additionally, being in Thea's head means you get to know what Thea is really like, and I found her to be childish and self absorbed. The author also allowed her to make huge mistakes in judgment. Why on earth wouldn't she give potential evidence to the police immediately? The book is so poorly written, that I began skim reading it around page 200. The author made the mistake that most writers are warned against; rather than Tope showing us what her characters were doing, she just let Thea tell us everything, sometimes wrapping things up in conclusions that had no supporting evidence. It was maddening and a total waste of time and money. Not even worth borrowing from the library let alone buying."
3,Well written but weak mystery,"This is the first book I've read by this author. I like her style of writing. The mystery was very weak. I will continue reading the series with the hope that the author will give the reader more insight into the character's personalities and that the mysteries are more interesting.Again, the style of writing is very good. Just needs some tweaking with the actual mystery itself."
3,Amateur leuthing as a part-time job,"I think I could get to like the heroine of this book, Thea Osbourne, if she could stop over-thinking everything and get on with life. In this book she house-sits in the Cotswolds and is unlucky enough to find a dead body on her first morning while walking the dogs. There are many unanswered questions, a host of villagers to get to know and some truths to be unraveled. The most fluid parts of the book are when Thea is with her dog, and it seems the author used her own experience to write them so well, but the sleuthing is good too. I read it engrossed until the end, which came rather suddenly, and will read more in the series."
1,WORST player ever!!!,"this outdated player may look great with its OUTDATED features, but I am warning you that it's not as great as it looks.multi file format-->It's been featured on Iriver and even iPods years and years ago.storage???-->256mb, that's not enough. These days, flash memory based mp3 players come up with at least 512Mb of memory to 2Gb of memory.10hr battery???--> even iPod, which is a hard drive mp3 player, tops that. iriver's battery lasts 40hours.small???--->compared to iAudio or samsung yepp items, this isn't even near ""small"".water resistant-->I have to admit. this is the only original idea that panasonic has brought up with. but a lot of better players come with water resistant kits that allows you to take the player when you are diving."
4,A Wild Ride,"Masatsugu Iwase-sensei is back! And none too soon. The Archangel, a state-of-the-art battle carrier, has managed to wend its way through perilous war zones thanks to young stud pilot Kira Yamato and his sidekick robot, the Strike Gundam. However, the never-ending battles take their toll on the young pilot Kira-who also suffers from horrific nightmares. While scavenging for desperately needed supplies deep in a graveyard of space colonies, the crew stumbles upon Lacus Clyne, the knock-out daughter of a high official of the Zaft Empire. Is this a good omen? Or not? When a return trip to the Earth-controlled district of Alaska goes terribly wrong, the Archangel winds up in an African desert attacked by new Zaft craft, one of which is piloted by Kira's best friend and most dangerous enemy, Athrun! Fasten your seat belts; you are in for a ride."
5,Western:,The Cheyenne were horse Indians...deadly when they were on the warpath. Led by Bear Claw they ran roughshod over the territory destroying everything in their path. The regular cavalry was slaughtered by the cunning Cheyenne chief and no one could stop him...except the Pony Soldiers.
4,"Helpful, but Incomplete","As a 1L (1st year law student), I find this book helpful, but I also find many times where the word isn't listed (probably b/c it's the pocket edition), so I'll have to go look at the full dictionary in my roomate's room or look it up online, which kind of defeats the purpose for why I got it. In hindsight, I should have gotten more used to looking it up online or ponying the extra money to get the complete dictionary."
2,"if you've got a webster's dictionary, don't bother with this","almost everything in this crappy dictionary is in webster's, and webster's does a much better job with the definitions. i bought this dictionary right before starting my first year of law school, now i'm about to graduate and i've used it maybe 5 times tops. definitely not worth buying."
5,Great for class!,"The Black's Law Dictionary pocket edition is great for class or for bringing with you when you are studying away from home. The definitions aren't as thorough, but you will get a good legal definition for all the terms you need as a 1L."
3,The Ultimate Rice Cooker Cookbook,"It' ok but I like a cookbook with pictures, make it more personal, you know what it's suppose to look like, recipes are ok."
2,Not what I thought,"I needed a cookbook that would give me recipes to use my new rice cooker for more things than just rice. When I received this, it has many ways to cook different kinds of rice and many recipes just using already cooked rice. Just not exactly what I thought it would be."
2,Toy Review,"I think that the Honda Accord should be more well made. The look of the car should be more well planned out. The Dub City cars are much more better looking and more durable. Although, i do like this car because it is one of the few Honda Accord toy cars out there. Thank you Hope you werent offended in anyway."
5,Perfect,"I bought this to use as a stencil for cakes, and hot cocoa. But it comes with a recipe for cookies, so i am definitely going to try that. It's very well made, and I am sure I'll find many uses for it- both in the kitchen, and for crafts."
5,"Superman's search for Truth, Justice & the Way","In a time of crisis and new technology we escape ""civilization"" in search of the simple life. Life proves never to be simple, just sometimes more fun. In the spirit of Kerouac's ""On the Road"" Bill Reed takes us on his adventure. He leaves us craving the warm sand, cold drinks and good friends. Grab this book, head to the beach, and enjoy the party. Life doesn't get any better!"
5,What An Adventure Story!,"Our kids just returned from a vacation in Puerto Vallarta. Among all the Mexican souvenir gifts they brought back, our favorite is the book, ""A Mexican Odyssey,"" which we read cover to cover over the weekend. What an adventure story! We could hardly believe Bill Reed lived such a life--writer, lover, art gallery owner, tour boat operator, troubadour, part-time gentleman, full-time mover and shaker, and a married man to boot? (God bless Sylvia; she must be the epitomy of a Mexican saint.) We've heard that wild and crazy guys really do exist out there in the world, but Reed is surely a cut above the rest. My husband loved his tall tales (especially the fishing, the scubing diving, and the raising hell over town stories) and I enjoyed reading about Reed's gradual realization that, if it weren't for a loving, supportive, and an obviously wiser-than-my-husband-is wife, men couldn't do squat! What a fun book to read!"
4,What a life!,"As a Vallarta resident, I bought this book because I was acquainted with the author 20 years ago. I wanted to get his version of events that happened then. Now, after reading his story, I wish I'd known him better. But then I may not have survived to tell the stories like he did. Anyone that thinks living in paradise is easy should read Bill's book. He's a great storyteller and even better...the stories are true! I loved it!"
3,"Lacks ""power"" of the dog","If you are interested in this book because you loved ""The Power of the Dog,"" you might be disappointed. Although the two books were written 20+ years apart, there is an abundance of similarities. The characters, setting, relationships and insecurities will sound very familiar. Yet this book isn't as dark, intense, or satisfying as ""Power of the Dog."" It is worth reading if you are intrigued with Thomas Savage. I definately am."
2,Subtitle Misleading,"I found that this book was mainly a long account of the author's observations of people who ""cut off"" from family members for reasons associated with divorce or adoption. Therefore it was not particularly helpful to me in my situation.There was little-to-NO help or history about real reconciliation or mutual forgiveness.However it was helpful to read of the mind-set of some of the young women who did the cutting-off;a. their need to feel powerful or ""in control"" of their environment.b. their self-absorbed attitude which denies the effect of their actions on others."
2,Not to great all around,"It took a long time for this item to be delivered, somehow it ended up going back to sender and had to be sent again. Aside from that, it said it was in good shape but upon arrival we opened the book and the pages all started to fall out. The purchase price was okay so we didn't take the time to send it back but the shipping was pretty high. Unfortunately for the sender they probably didn't make much money since they had to ship it twice. Just not was we expected."
1,Very disappointing!!,This cd is very disappointing. Disco inferno sounds like it has been sung by Millie Vanilli. The remixes are even more horrible (by the producers of Modern Talking). I resend it after listening for less then 1 minute. My ears couldn't stand the torturous noise. Stay away from this one!!!
5,Very Happy,"This is an excellent buy and an excellent flea/tick shampoo. It is concentrated and can easily make enough shampoo for your pet for most of (or all of) its life. I use it on my cat (who doesn't like to get a bath) and it is easily applied and rinses with very little water. Also, the flea/tick medication is effective without making your pet sick or uncomfortable. I recommend this to all pet owners as a GREAT DEAL for the price and quality."
4,very good buy,"My order was received in a timely manner, which I was very satisfied with. The product was in very good condition as the description stated, and the price was excellent. If I had an issue with the purchase, it was that the writing in this edition was very small. The description area probably should include that kind of information if different prints are available for the purchaser."
4,Money isn't everything,"While I disagree with some of the details Radin's fundamental insight is sound. Whereas human value systems are characterized by value-pluralism (see for example Concepts and Categories, Isaiah Berlin, Princeton Univ. Press) business and capitalism require value monism (i.e., utility is a scalar) and are in contradiction with one another. Technically, the error in capitalism is that utility should be a vector rather than a scalar like money. (Theory of Games and Economic Behavior, von Neumann and Morgenstern, Princeton Univ. Press, 1944, pgs 19-20)"
4,Excellent Music!!,"This album is great for those interested in MPB (musica popular brasileira). Mr. Clayderman plays the piano to perfection. I enjoy listening to this CD when I want to relax with my memories of sunny Brazil. Although completely instrumental, it still manages to capture the brazilian spirit of the songs. A very good buy."
3,Mahler's Symphony No. 9,I like the recording. I have heard other recording that I thought were better I just did not know who the conductor or the orchestra. This is one of my favorite symphonies.
1,The REd Shoes,"The resolution and quality of this DVD is very poor. Furthermore, the dialogue is in English but there are Chinese subtitles, which is very distracting and this was not part of the description from the website."
1,HOW TO REVIEW SOMETHING THAT NEVER ARRIVED????,"I would love more than anything to review this movie. However, I have not yet received it -- and my inquiries to the seller have all gone unanswered. I ordered it on December 5...it is now January 7...and still no movie!This has taught me a great lesson -- DO NOT EVER BUY ANYTHING FROM AN AMAZON SELLER!!!! IT IS NOT WORTH THE HASSLE! They have my money now...no wonder they don't bother to answer any inquiries about where my product is!!"
4,Great Southwest Mystery,"Desert Noir is a really good first in a planned new mystery series. PI Lena Jones is one tough lady who has several mysteries in her own life: Who shot her when she was a child? Who and where are her parents? Not all her questions are answered in this first book and some of the relationships are just developing and their outcomes do not seem predictable. I am glad something is left for later books. It will be most interesting to see Lena grow and mature. Author Webb, who writes for a Scottsdale paper, does a good job of making Scottsdale (the arty West's Most Western Town) a character of this novel. Good job. I'm waiting for the next in the series."
2,Mediocre at Best,"I read mysteries for the simple enjoyment of it all. I don't expect great literature - but I struggled to get through this one. Maybe I've been spoiled by J.A. Jance. I've come to expect interesting plots and subplots, compelling dialog, and likeable characters. None of these are evident in Desert Noir. I'll continue my search for new mystery/suspense writers."
3,Somewhere in the Middle,I liked this book enough to finish it. It's not a page turner or mysterious mystery. There's a lot of filler in between interviewing suspects. Not that many suspects were interviewed and the story kind of ambled along. Maybe this being book one of the series the others will pick up just a tad bit. I will read the next one just to find out if it did.
5,Excellent mystery,This is an excellent mystery with a great new female detective. The bad guys in Betty Webb's stories are always those who put financial gain over human feelings. The heroes of her stories are those who are open to other cultures and who fight for equal rights for all people.
3,Decription,"Enjoyed the story line, however, everytime she took a walk or run too muchdecription of the same areas. She suspected everyone at one time or other.She may very light of her consultant's job and really did not contributethat much."
3,Desert Mystery,"I rate this book 3.5 stars. I enjoyed this mystery very much and I intend to read the next book in the series. Other reviewers have already to attended to the synopsis so I won't reinterate. There was a lot to like about this well thought out mystery.Lena Jones the main character is one tough lady. She is ex-policewoman turned Private Investigator. Lena has several deep seated issues, because of her early life she believes she is unable to love and be loved. However she is one fierce lady, dogged in the pursuit of justice. She is also a likeable character who comes across to the reader as extremely vulnerable and at times fragile. She is surrounded by a cast of caring, well fleshed out characters.What I really enjoyed about this book was the vivid descriptions of the Arizona desert, and about Indian folk lore. The mystery component of the book was pretty good as well. Occasionally the story got a little slow but I think the book was time and money well spent for me...."
5,ULTIMATE..,"Well to be honest i bought it flying to manchester via amsterdam in 30th of september. i first listened to it about mid-november. The thing is just ultimate trance experience in your brain. 80 well selected tracks like Marcel woods - Static States, Tiesto and sensation anthem. 4 cds with complete trance sub categories Hard trance a more light melodic trance. this thingy here has it all. a must gentlemen, a must indeed!"
3,Relaxing Piano,"This album is no. 6 in a selection of different types of music. This time out, Clayderman interprets a wide range of pop tunes including 'When A Man Loves A Woman', Stardust, etc. Excellent job on 'Bridge Over Troubled Water' and 'Woman In Love', etc. Not so great are 'Sailing' and the overdone 'Yesterday'. Every artist on the planet must have covered the latter. If you want background music or jack the volume, this is not a bad album."
4,definitely not The Intercontinentals,"Most interesting and adventurous work Frisell's released in almost a decade. Dissonant and abstract. Parts resemble Bartok's string quartet writing. One for those of us who have grown quite bored with the pentatonic blues licks and the static vamps.Thanks Songlines for putting this out, and for doing such a comprehensive job in presenting the project."
5,Masterpiece,"You should read the first books to learn the characters, but this is an exceptional treat. I always enjoy Kerry Greenwoods books, but she really takes her time with the characters, the world history and the plot in this book. Toss in a little science and a little fun and stir well. This is a winner on all fronts. And rather than being an uninvolved detective, she gets personally involved in one of the sub plots to an unprecedented level. This is the one that should be made into a movie, IMO."
3,Disney's Evilest,"This soundtrack is yet another great one from the makers of Disney. But instead of putting all the ""feel good"" tracks on it, they decided to go the evil route. Personally, the best tracks on here are:2. Gaston5. The Siamese Cat Song8. Be Prepared &10. Cruella De Vilbut those are only my choices. For you avid Disney fans (kids, parents, & adults), you'll probably end up liking most, if not all, of these songs."
5,Most excellent service.,My niece was delighted with this. She played it for the trick or treaters who came to her house. She said she was the DJ.The seller was so helpful in being sure that the CD arrived prior to Halloween so my niece would have it for her Halloween festivities. I appreciated the seller's sensitivity toward my special-needs niece.
4,"A little snug, not waterproof, but good boots overall","They feel a little tight when all laced up, but I suppose most boots are and that may be considered a positive. I usually wear them a little loose and untied. I bought these for fishing (light water encounters) and snow and so far they've held up well and still look great after a little over a year. They are not 100% waterproof, though. I waded into three inches of water which soaked right through, leaving me with wet feet on my fishing trip."
2,not like the used to be,"I've been wearing Hi-Tek Magnums for many years. It seems that recently the quality has plummeted. One of the seams pulled open within the first month. It was very disappointing. I'm looking for light weight boot alternatives, now."
5,Winning London is a WINNER!,This soundtrack is the best record! I just love it. I bought it for my older sister and we both fight over it now. It's so great and fun. I really love the Noogie song Danger! Get Out of London rocks and the french song is so fun.. me and my sister try to sing every word!!!! :)
3,MK and A Olsen shouldn't have tracks on this soundtrack,Okay...to start off with...there are some tracks that just have Mary Kate and Ashley talking to each other...and the last time i checked that was not music and it sure in hell isn't worth paying for.
4,Awesome,I really liked this soundtrack. It had more edge than the other movies and cd's. Great songs and a great movie. My favorite song from the cd is Ca Plane Pour Moi. I suggest this cd to anyone.
1,Piece of Garbage - Do Not Buy!,"The TRE500 fires multiple staples and NONE of them penetrate the wood. I searched the internet looking for a solution and the best I got was, ""throw it away""."
1,"DON""T BUY THIS STAPLER!!!!!","Biggest piece of junk tool I've ever purchased. Misfired, jammed, or just plain wouldn't set the staple all the way in at least 75% of the time shooting 1/4"" staples into softwood. AVOID THIS PRODUCT!"
3,underpowered,"I purchased the gun to redo the seat covers on the dining room chairs.The staples would not completly penetrate the hard wood bottoms.I had to hammer them in.It has two settings,high/low,there did not seem to be any difference between the two.Got out my air stapler and finished the job.Underpowered in my opinion,spend some extra money and buy a much more powerful staple gun.Might work well on very soft wood or marshmellows, havn't tried yet."
2,Perhaps for small jobs...,"But not for jobs requiring some fastening power. I used it for a few carpet jobs but still ended up using my hammer and screwdriver to fully bury the staples. My old Arrow T50m manual fastener drove staples more powerfully than this. This one is good to have around for lightweight jobs where you just want to bang some staples into fairly soft material with little effort, but thats about it. 2 stars for nice clean design with on/off switch for safety and being a handy tool."
4,Stanley Electric Nail and Staple Gun,"I have not had the opportunity to use the nail/staple gun as yet, butmy husband and I tried it out when I got it. It seems that it willwork perfectly for what I need it to do."
3,Great but only for softer woods than Oak,"Purchased one of these to drive 3/8"" Stainless Steel Arrow T-50 staples through thin indoor-outdoor carpet into oak stairs. The staples worked fin in my manual Arrow T-50 gun, but the Stanley gun, at it;s highest setting could only get the staples in all the way about half the time. One bang with a hammer drove them in the rest of the way , but that defeats the idea of the electric gun, in my opinion.It did perform well on a block of Alder and also Doug Fir, but forget about Oak , Walnut or hardwoods.I would recommend this product for woods softer than Oak."
1,Down for the Count!,"I have been remodeling a house and purchased the Stanley TRE550 electric stapler to tack up the insulation on the walls. We are talking relatively light work, since I was using 1/4 inch staples and didn't worry about whether they went fully in. Before I finished one room, the device quit! First it was intermittent, then it finally just gave up. Took it back to Home Depot thinking it was just a dud and picked up another THE550. You guessed it - I think I finished a few more rooms before that one died. I went back to HD again, and I was going to get different model, but there wasn't anything available at the time so I picked up another TRE550 (the third one). I just had the garage to do, and it got me through it. Now, I was just working on a small studio and, yes, probably 150 staples in to this job this stapler stopped. I think I have learned my lesson. No more TRE550s."
1,Not worth it,"I thought this would make my upholstery job easier. Now, I have to hammer each staple in, regardless of the setting. And forget odd angles- my manual works better. Unless you're flush against the surface, the staples don't even go in. The price is right, but only if it works as well as a manual. It does not. Maybe the $100 range does the job. Going back to the silver stapler."
1,I Couldn't Agree More,"I couldn't agree more with the other reviewers in this class (one star.) I've never written a review before, but this unit is so poor at setting staples that I am confused why it was ever marketed. Surely, Stanley knew it would be found out? The staples do not penetrate, the +/- control is cosmetic only, and the shame of putting this into a landfill is more valuable than the item. Is this American made?"
1,defective on delivery,The staple gun arrived almost 2 weeks before the staples. When I purchased the exact staples I ordered at my local hardware store I found the staple gun defective in that it did not fire staples every time I pulled the trigger making it's use so frustrating I immediately returned it for a refund. I rated the item with one star because the web page would not accept my review without a star checked.
1,Worst. Stapler. Ever.,"Bought this thing a few months ago and have had nothing but trouble with it. As others mentioned, staples won't go in all the way no matter what setting it's on, and if you use an extension cord with it, it's even worse. After owning it for less than a year, I just went to (try to) staple down some carpet padding and all I got was a click. Feels like something loose inside, so I guess I'll have to mail it back to Stanley if I want another one. Better yet, I think I'll skip that entirely and just buy something decent."
1,One of us is an idiot.,"I bought this staple gun at a local store and it is pointless. Either I'm seriously stupid and missing a step, or this thing doesn't work right. It only drives the staples/brads 1/2 to 3/4 of the way in. And even then, it greatly deforms and twists the top of the staple. I REALLY feel that their is something minor that *I'M* doing wrong, but judging by all the other people saying excactly the same thing I see the nailer is just pointless. No wonder it was on such a good sale when I bought it. :("
1,Underpowered.,"Works great if you're stapling into styrofoam. Another reviewer wrote:""Here is how the stapler works, first you fire the shortest staple (1/4 "") into soft pine wood, then you realize that it did not go all the way in, now you take the hammer and finish driving the staple in......see how easy it is?""This is exactly, and I mean exactly right. It's like this is a staple ""starter"" gun where you come behind and complete the process manually.Spend your money on something else."
2,Not adjustable,"The hat is really nice but it is not adjustable. I bought the hat for our 2 year old and needless to say without the adjustment ability its pretty large on him. He'll grow into it but I feel rather decieved since it is marketed as a ""Youth Adjustable Cap."" There is a slight elasticity to the back but that's about it."
2,Bird didn't like it,I had a hard time attaching it to the cage My bird wouldn't sit on it Had to remove it was too big for a small size
3,Great Information But Not Very Helpful,"I'm really scared about my kids driving. I just don't think they really know what dangers are out there every time you leave the driveway, so I bought the book, Crash-Proof Your Kids. The book really does have a lot of information in it, primarily about how I can do a better job of teaching them, but it's still just words. The book is not nearly as effective as real life experience, but who wants their kids to experience an accident to learn the harsh realities? I foundDriving Simulator SimuRide Home Edition for PC, and it gives a far better taste of hands on driving experience that my kids can use to become better defensive drivers."
3,A great gift.,Gave this as a gift to my daughter who has a sixteen year old son. I didn't read all of it but it seemed like the right thing for the moment.
5,"Among the finest books ever written about the finest of men,","George Alcock greeted me with a warm knowing smile at the International Workshop of Cometary Astronomy at Cambridge, England in 1999. I was there because I had discovered a comet. He was there because he had discovered 5 comets and had become a great legend among astronomers not only for his work in astronomy but because of his Michaelangelo like adeptness in the arts, education and other sciences. People obtain knowledge in many ways but mostly they learn by example from their teachers and from books. Here is a book about the finest English Gentleman and scholar who by the example of him that is portrayed in this book will inspire and show the way for the discoverers and educators of today and tomrrow."
3,Utinsils leave marks,"The 1st platter came shattered, The second shows every stainless mark when used. Love the size however. Needs a stronger clear coating to guard against the marks."
2,wobbles on table,"For some reason, I haven't had much luck with this line. They are manufactured poorly. This particular piece is not level and wobbles on the table or counter."
5,Kris zawsze zywy,"Krzysztof K nie umiera nigdy, jest jak stare dobre wino choc i jemu nie wyszla proba z Disco Polo, trafil zapewne do szerokiej klienteli gatunku jednak jego stare dobre czasy to wlasnie zawartosc tego albumu."
2,great product at a lousy price!,"i'd been searching for these nifty little picks cause they're the best. i'd gone through the supply my dentist gave me and was glad to find them on amazon -- even if buying multiple packs of 20 could get a little pricey for plastic picks. when they arrived, i noticed that they were manufactured by a company called zila. turns out i could have purchased 120 picks from zila for LESS than the 60 i got from dental usa! that's not a mark-up, that's extortion. got me once...but won't get me again."
3,Expensive,"This product is expensive for what you get.I do like the product, but it was better when my dentist gave it to me at my check up, FREE."
1,A real ripoff in price,"I have bought this product for many years from my dentist. I paid $5.00 for a package of 120 picks. When I changed dentists, I looked on the internet for the product and found the company offering the product for $8.00. Well I ordered four packages, and didn't notice that the product quantity being offered was only 20, not 120. When I received the order, I found that instead of the packaging I expected, it contained only the little plastic container with 20 piks inside (x4). The company had taken the Roto-Point product as it was previously packaged and given out for purchase, and are selling the 120 picks divided into 6. I am very unhappy about this and althought I made the mistake of not seeing the reduced quantity, the product is grossly overpriced. A true case of let the buyer beware.P.S. the Roto-Point interdental cleaners are a very good product - this Company selling them is gouging the consumer."
5,Great little picks!,"Had some many years ago. Found out they are no longer sold in stores and was glad to find them via Amazon. They are easy to use with the ""square"" handle and super fine pointy end and the straight line design."
3,A step in the right direction,"Though no body's perfect miss Asma has tried to go a long way in gettin her message across to the american public in general that, islam isnt a religion of fanatics and like every religion this one to has its share of fanatics and liberals. After all the term fundamentalist was coined for the christians of europe in the middle ages. After a long time a young person with on hand experience of life and problems facing muslims in USA is there to tell wat the real islam is, wether be it through the book or being interviewed on television. There are always more then the handful of ppl who want to get board the critisism band wagon, but i would ask them that no one's perfect and at least she made a start where as many others have been just silent spectators."
2,Disturbing,"I was very disturbed reading this book. First off, there are many mispellings, for example, Taliban is Talikan. If this book is supposed to be informative, important words should at least be spelled correctly. Second, the author seems to take her own interpretation of Islam as the truth for Islam all over the world, this is vey problematic. What right does an American who grew up in a privledged family have telling Muslims all over the world that their interpretation is wrong? The author's view of Islam seems very westernized to me, so therefore I cannot take her opinion vey seriously becasue most Muslims dread having their religion being flitered down by the west,which Hasan does. Her values on dating and marriage are inaccurate to the Koran, in fact much of this book is historically inaccurate. Hasan also is stuck in a middle class view, such as her views on success. Hasan should remember that not all Muslims have the money or power to cater their religion to their own needs."
5,Dynamic.!...Fantastic look into an American Culture!,This is one of the best books I have read concerning an American culture...Asma is down to earth and gives us a look into a the Muslim world with humor and great insight...Kudos to Miss Hasan!
1,American Muslim,"This book should not be viewed as book telling people what Islam is. As a student of Religious Studies and one who has read much about the faith of Islam i can not say that this book is a fair representation of what Islam is. Asma Gull Hasan is not an authority on Islam she has not been schooled in all its principles. This book is more about her opinion and interpertation. If one is really interested in learing about Islam i suggest ""The Vision of Islam"", ""Islam the religion of life"", and ""Muhammad""."
4,very good book buy it,poetic writings on each of the hebrew letters to help you understand tarot and the qaballah tree of light and can be applied to other learnings on pathworking includes psalms that kind of bugged me in a kneejerk reaction however they are very applicable and not random judeochristian bible verse or rote. her other books on pathworking are excellent mmust haves
5,Excellent,"I have found a fascination in learning more about the Middle Eastern culture and in the process of coming across new music I found this CD, Niyaz, and it is excellent. Azam Ali's voice is truly amazing. I can listen to this cd at work, or even in the house and I can relax and even be inspired to get up and dance to some songs. I can't wait to listen to more music from her and by Vas. This CD is definately a must have!"
5,Niyaz,I had never heard of this group or any of their music and I happened to see it at one one of the bookstores. Normally I don't even buy music but this was just awesome.
5,Sensuality incarnate in sound.,"If it was possible to encapsulate Tantric Sex in audio form, this would be the album. The melodies and the voice physically touch you. A masterpiece of its kind. Azam Ali is Kali reborn."
2,Dissapointed after a long wait...,"I have been mesmorized by Niya Yesh for three years now, and at the same time- aniously awaiting a new release from Axiom of Choice. I special ordered this album, before it was even released, as soon as I heard about it. I listened to it once, thought maybe I had not given it an honest chance- maybe expecting (hoping) it to be as good as Niya Yesh and the second time around was just as difficult. My husband (who is Persian) listened to it once and now it's gathering dust on the CD rack. Soo dissapointing."
4,The Burzinski Breakthrough,"This book was exactly what I expected. Although the book covers Dr. B's struggles with the FDA quite well, I would have preferred more detailed info regarding Dr. B's controversial protocol."
1,False Hope,"This book is not only waste of your time and money, but is also dangerous as it gives a baseless hope to patients who may potentially benefit from another, more proven method of treatment... From our family's experience with ""Dr."" Burzynski, I believe he is nothing more than a cheat who takes full advantage of desperate people looking for a true breakthrough."
1,Facts are Facts,"Through quite a bit of research, I have not found any body of facts that in any way support the points made by the author about the Burzynski treatment for cancers.Instead, research of facts (as part of the public record) over the years presents a case which counters the conclusions made by Mr. Elias.However, those who choose to place faith in this book are most likely in a terrible situation; a situation that clouds objective reasoning."
1,Sensational,"This book fails to pass the litmus test of plausibility. At best, it reminds this reader of the endless books which support alien earth encounters, President Kennedy's assassination by an operative of Walt Disney, etc...Yes, I admitt I've read all this kind of stuff.I'm not a man of science, but my gut tells me this book should be relegated to the Jerry Springer School of Mindless Hot Air.Vince Wise Lisbon, Ohi"
2,Expecting too much!,"Maybe I was expecting too much from this book based on a fairly excellent customer reviews at amazon. I maybe expecting too much cause because to my surprise, the book dealt with point and shoot aside from DSLR cameras. I was kind of disappointed with that. I own a Nikon D200 and a Nikon 105mm f2.8 macro lens to learn the art of macrophotography and to my surprise coolpix camera shots were there....honestly i was turned off with that! If you are expecting a purely DSLR macrophotography on this book you may have to look elsewhere! I felt that there was something missing in this book. I know some of you out there knows what I mean...it lacks some oomph!!"
3,Digital Nature Photography Closeup,This book only covers the basics of macro photography and is suitable for 'newbies' at photography. Book and pictures are average quality. Experienced (macro) photographers should look further for technique and inspriration.
1,Curse of BigJoke,"Wow, I thought there was a few good logging scenes in this movie other than that it's just very cheesy. I don't know if I can handle watching it again to understand what the other reviewers saw in it.?(I don't think so, for now.. Maybe let some friends watch and suffer through it, first.) Definately a very cheaply, inexpensively made movie as it clearly states on the back cover; a great film for ""bad movie"" lovers? That says it all! I don't think it was no curse of Bigfoot, but a curse on anyone who can stand to sit and watch it....lol!!!! I should have gotten paid to buy and watch it........."
3,Mixed review from my kids,"One of my kids likes it. My other child did like it but then grew to hate it. I do not know why, but he said it tastes disgusting. He has to eat it with food to mask the taste, otherwise he starts gagging on the vitamin."
3,Thanks,Ordered this for my husband who LOVES Biker Boyz. It is the reason behind him learning to ride a bike and actually purchasing one. This will make a great stocking stuffer for him.Thanks for such a great turn around time on receiving.
3,Burn rubber not your soul,"The Biker Boyz cd is exciting. Some of the songs instantly take you back to how you felt during the film.The songs ""Ride"", ""Kalifornia"", and my personal favorite, ""Don't Look Down"" are the strongest on the album. There are a few that I don't like but overall it is a good listen."
3,Best Song: Changin' By Brass Construction Not included,Best Song: Changin' By Brass Construction Not included
4,"this is a good song, what is it?","What is the song that uses ""out of africa"" for the beat during the bike wash?"
4,Missing something,the soundtrack is tight as the movie but one of the phatest songs in the movie is not even on the soundtrack. I was wondering if anybody nows who is singing and the name of the song of when Kid wins is first race and stands up on his bike?
3,Mystery song from Biker Boyz,"Is anyone esle wondering who sings that mystery song that was playing when Kid races and wins with extra showmanship by standing up on his bike? The name of the song is ""Flying High"" by Andre ""Dre Boogie"" Wilson and S Class. Of course, it's not on the soundtrack b/c that would've been too convenient for us music fans. I haven't been able to find this song yet, but that's what it is."
3,Tryin to find out a song title????????,"Does anyone know the title & artist who does the song playing when they test Primo's skills after the dinner. I haven't been able to find out. E-mail me with the info if you know rwilder1@comcast.netThanks,Q"
2,Missing Volume 1,"Beware, I ordered this book with no hint whatsoever that it is volume 2 of a collection of 2 books. It arrived and I was disappointed to see that rather being the entire Annotations of the Pentateuch by Henry Ainsworth, it includes only Numbers, and Deuteronomy, Psalms and Song of Songs. The first volume with a memoir of the author, Genesis through Leviticus is apparently available, but check to be sure it is Vol. 1; if you wish the complete Annotations."
4,Biological Weapons Defense,"This is a great book. The only thing I don't like is that The chapters are only numbered at the beginning of each chapter. If you just open the book randomly, you don't know what chapter you are reading."
3,"Not great, but very good","In creating this release, Parsons said he ""imagined a gathering of mystics, headed by a high shaman, at night in a remote desert valley."" The music certainly has a desert feel to it.He relies almost purely on electronic instruments here, but each track features at least one traditional middle-eastern instrument. All but one track, ""Whirling Into Light"", are in a minor key, lending a slightly sinister tone to the CD. The synth-rhythms move quickly - this is certainly not ambient music. You get the sense that the mystics are gathered around a huge bonfire, shaking and dancing ecstatically during the night.But it doesn't feel AS Middle-Eastern as, say, Open Canvas. It is has only a slight mid-east feel to it, which doesn't really set it apart from his other music or make it a unique experience. It's not my favorite of David Parsons' many CDs, but worth listening if you're a fan of his, or if you like electronic music."
1,Not Happpy,"We had great expectations for this item.It looks great, easy assembly. Performance ""F"". It really did not warm the towels. Product was returned for a full refund.Easy return- ""A+"""
1,Review of an item that didn't arrive,I ordered it on the 30/7/2011 and until today 6/9/2011 it hasn't arrived. I sent 2 emails to the Cosmetic solutions company but no reply.
5,EXCELLENT! FANTASTIC!!,"Just the Pictures on a Exhibition would have been worth it, but with the added Songs and Dances of Death, this CD is truly amazing. Get this CD."
3,Mixed Bag,"Bernstein's ""Pictures at an Exhibition"" is somewhat lackluster and flat sounding. I own a Stanley Black recording on vinyl that sounds better than this piece! However, ""Songs and Dances of Death"" is very good and may be worthwhile to you."
1,Bootleg CD with half of the tracks,"On this CD you'll only find side A of the original album ""Skin Diver Suite"", side B is not included. Too bad... Plus: It's taken from vinyl, not from the mastertape. I guess for this price you could expect a little more than an incomplete vinyl rip."
3,"Good album, but not more than that","I heard of this band (one man band I think) on insound.com and thought I'd give it a try. This album has a dozen of acoustic songs and some have a few electronic in them. This is a cool album to listen but it has a few week points. First, the singer's voice is really poor and it really does not help the appreciation of that album. Secondly, the songs are really similar to each other. I'd give this album a 3.5 cause it's not bad to listen, not awesome. If the singer practices his voice, he could have a great success, but this is kinda good for a first release."
3,Silver Apples - 'The Garden' (Whirlybird Records),"All fourteen of these tracks have never been released before.Awhile back,original/long lost Silver Apples drummer Danny Taylor was at work when he heard an Apples tune on the radio.Taylor then phoned and faxed SA mastermind Simeon and the two were happily reunited.They apparently went through an old truck full of Taylor's stuff and stumbled across a studio tape that both had completely forgotten about.Maybe not as great as their first two albums,but 'The Garden' is decent.Some of the songs that I thought carried their own are ""I Don't Care What People Say"",""Mad Man Blues"" and the cool instrumental ""Anasazi Noodle"".If you're a fan,you shouldn't be let down.If you're wanting to check out the band for the first time,get their self-titled debut and/or 'Contact'."
4,Silver Apples C.D.,"This is a very good c.d. by Silver Apples. They have a unique sound that not all people like, but I have continued to enjoy their music since the early 1970's. I was so glad to find it on your web site!"
3,Better but not the best,"I played it the other day and was kind of disappointed. My first impression was that is was a flat performance. There is no comparison to the 2006 live album. The version of feel like makin love on that CD was phenom. Back to the Ukraine - I was pleasently suprised to see some more Bad Co. tunes though. It also looked like they were either tired or slightly drunk, or both. Anyway, Rodgers' has the voice."
5,Excellent Book,"Dr. Leifer, a psychiatrist, borrows from his Buddhist practice and hisclinical experience to offer profound insights into the sources ofanxiety and depression in the West. He makes a compelling case thatthe projects we develop to make us happy become the sources of ourunhappiness. Meditation can help reduce the three ""poisons""that make us miserable--desire, aversion, and ignorance."
5,A clear view of Buddism.,"Clearly written, easy to understand and put into practice. After reading over100 books on eastern ideas,this book struck a cord in me(a light went on)."
4,A gearheads bible for Alfa's little twin-cammer,"Is the material dated...most of it probably, but so is the subject. There is very little available for those of us who have this love-hate passion with old cars, especially if our object of affection is one of the many lovely and sometimes obscure models or makes from Europe. The Alfa four cylinder twin-cam engines comes from a time when the owner of a car could, if they felt like it, tune or modify the car without having to remap a silicone chip (I've looked all over my Weber's and I have not been able to find a serial or USB interface for my laptop). Today's designs are marvels of efficiency and reliability but for many of us whom like to get grease under our fingernails working on pre ""HAL"" controlled jewels like the Alfa inline TC fours and sixes, this book conveys a trove of information on what will work in our quest to squeeze the most performance from our lovely Italian mistresses (imho)."
4,Lots of information,"This book not only touches on the obvious, but delves into various topics as related to bipolar II. Sections on exercise, finding a good psychiatrist, options in medications, are comprehensive and helpful.I was very pleased to find a resource this helpful with bipolar II."
5,any doubts about being bipolar?,"this book was extremely clarifying and enlightening. having had it suggested to me that i may be bipolar, this book confirmed it! not only did it help me understand my depression but also offered management techniques and realistic goal setting techniques that really work. it couldnt have been a better read."
4,Excellent,Really helps the reader understand. There are so many forms of the illness people can have and this breaks it all down and gives you advise on how to talk to your doctor.
5,Why Am I Still Depressed?,This book was written in a way for all to understand the complexities of Bi-Polar Disorder and how to recognize the many different signs/symptoms of the disease.Dr Phelps truly is TOP of his league in guiding you through this roller coaster ride of ups and downs of emotional bouts.I truly appreciated his keeping in mind alot of his readers who needed to keep it simple.
4,"Good Read, where to go when meds just aren't helping","Book was fairly straightforward with some evidence based information and some facts. Mainly this book gave me insight I didn't have into the bipolar world without ever having mania. It gave me a starting point to talk to my psychiatrist about ""where do we go now"" after trying so many meds. And where do we go? With a new outlook, we are now trying. At least i can have some hope."
2,Not helpful,"I felt this book could have been summed up in one chapter. It kept repeating things over and over again. Also, I felt more depressed and confused as I read. I felt overall it was a negative book."
3,Why am I still Depressed,Very informative in helping to understand soft bipolar disorder andthe causes. Useful information on the treaments that are available.
2,"Vague, not really helpful","This book was not only too vague, but was told in such a way that ANYONE who ever had any depression in their lifetime at all probably has Bipolar II. Some of the explanations were ridiculous and offered little alternatives such as medical reasons. There was a lot of opinion and character accounts and I found the book to be more of a fiction tale than a non-fiction reference book. I've already swapped it out of my library. If you need to learn about Bipolar II go with another option."
4,Well written book that focuses on bipolar II and mild forms,I bought this book two months after my diagnosis of bipolar type II. This book describes in depth how depression and hypomania effect people. It's very practical and focuses more on people who don't experience mania and have serious depressive episodes.
4,Depression that goes with Bipolar 2,"I got this book because it was recommended to me by two different therapists. I like it. It explains aspects of Bipolar 2 that I didn't know or understand before. I would rate it better but that the fact that it's some years old, so the material is not as up-to-date as a newer publication would be."
1,"THE MOST DISORGANIZED, WORTHLESS BOOK I HAVE EVER READ","WHY AM I STILL DEPRESSED IS THE MOST DISORGANIZED, WORTHLESS BOOK I HAVE EVER READ. I KNOW AGREAT DEAL ABOUT BI POLAR 2, AND FROM THE REVIEWS IN AMAZON OF THIS MC GRAW HILL BOOK THOUGHT I WOULD LEARN MORE.READ IT, AND YOU WILL SEE WHAT I MEAN. HOW MCGRAW HILL EDITORS AND AMAZON REVIEWERS WOULD LET THAT THING GET THROUGH IS A PUZZLEMENT.CAN YOU SEND MY HARD EARNEDD MONEY BACK TO ME. WILL YOU DARE PRINT MY REVIEW.JOHN G. MILLERRICHMOND, VIRGINIA"
2,Not worth the money,"Nothing new. It actually made me feel depressed! Being a new book I really thought it would have information I can use. It does not. It may be good for people that are not sure if they are bipolar (thats the only reason I gave it 2 stars) but as for me, it's not worth the money. The same sentences are repeated many times and if you happen to be Bipolar 1 looking for more modern ideas on bipolar in general forget this book, it makes bipolar one look hopeless."
4,A little long for the info given; it's only about the depressive side.,"This book can get a bit technical and provides too much information that isn't relevant to the casual reader. There is great information on the current medications that is easy to read, understand and remember. If you have been diagnosed with or think you may have bipolar disorder, this book probably isn't for you. After reading this, you will need to find a book that includes more information about the mania side of bipolar."
5,The Book of Life-A Very Special K Book,"This volume is one of the most unique Krishnamurti books available. All the books by or about him seem to offer added insight but this book is very useful in what it brings to the reader. I found that it was best, for me, to read a week's worth of daily readings at a sitting since they are chosen to relate to each other...each week having a single focus. No book can capture the man or the totality of his challenge to us but this book surely is a must for anyone seriously trying to get an understanding of the man and his trying to verbalize that which is not easily expressed in words."
5,Breadth and Depth,"I am an avid reader of Krishnamurti's work. I think he was probably the most enlightened and insightful human being in recorded history. We are very fortunate to have had someone with his clarity share his insights at a time when his words could be carefully recorded and transcribed to avoid the misinterpretation, confusion, and distortion that have occurred with past enlightened people like Christ.This particular book is a great collection of some of K's most powerful and profound insights organized into categories like love, religion, the self, etc."
5,An overlooked gem!,"This admittedly short VHS rates as one of my favorite Neil Young releases ever. Although given a (unwarranted) yawn of a review in Jimmy McDonough's Neil Young biography ""Shakey"",I think it is the most beautiful live recording I have ever seen. The photography is exquisite (for VHS, of course), the playing live, moody and beautiful, and the lack of banter in-between songs lends it an almost church-like reverence, the camera capturing the dust floating and sparkling in the sunlight. I find it hard to believe this video was criticized, and have been holding my breath for years that it will be re-released on DVD, or dare I say it, Blu-ray. Neil, if you're out there we beg of you; PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE re-release this masterpiece!!!"
3,Review of Olympic Marathoner Frank Shorter's LIfe,"Pretty good detail on Frank Shorter's rise from a pretty fair HS distance runner to a versatile athlete that could run national and world class 5Ks, 10Ks and marathons. He and Prefontaine kicked off the running boom. Shorter was part of the great USA running elite and central character in the outstanding Florida Track Club. Also, detail in his fight to establish more control of the American track athlete's rights to compete from the then AAU and the now TAC. Although I enjoyed the book I found it a bit choppy. It reminded me of a telling told in a series of interviews that sometimes overlap in detail. I think a greater collaberation would have been more effective if Kenny Moore (Sports Illustrated writer and 4th place USA finisher to Shorter's gold) wrote it with Shorter."
4,This is how you do it hasbro!!!,Hasbro take notes. This is one of the best toybiz figures.PROS.1.The light works well2.He's the most bendable nightcrawler ever made.3.He comes with cool swords.4.Based off Ultimate version.Cons.1.The light shines through some parts of his head with not enough paint.2. His tail doesn't bend.
5,Our girls love these movies,"My girls are obsessed with princesses and ballerinas. The setting is in Great Britan and everyone has Brittish accents. That seems to make it more fun for the girls. The movies include lessons about working hard to reach goals, caring for others, and team work. My wife and I are not big fans of ""Barbie"" style little teenager type of shows or toys and we think Angelina is very appropriate for our 3 and 5 year old."
1,No stars because it was so disappointing!,"I've always been a great fan of any Camelot story but found this whole series extremely disappointing and frustrating. Here is this queen, supposedly very powerful and carrying on the last of a long Mother-worship religion--and she can't do anything, seemingly can't even think logically. She lets her husband decide everything, even after he's just specifically agreed to first consult her--and she let's him. She feels guilty for following her Mother religion, yet her husband doesn't seem to be all that twisted up for commiting incest (not to mention having and affair). Everyone in these books seemed weak from Merlin down to the little maid Ina who could have been far more influential. The only one that seemed to be doing any thinking was Morgan, and she was more a phantom then a real person. It was also never clearly explained how Morgan learned all her extremely proficient magic. Save your money; re-read Mists of Avalon or the Crystal Cave series instead."
3,The Knight of the Sacred Lake,"The first book of the series was good but then I found myself thinking ""Okay Guenevere, get over it"". Still was an okay read."
2,Disappointing,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. The characters are one-dimensional, the plot juvenile, and the language irritating. I quickly got tired of words such as ""Otherworldly"" and ""thigh-freedom"". The treatment of Christian characters is also a bit disturbing."
4,real idiot,"just as its name suggest, the book is for ""complete idiot"", the info spetrum is very broad. namely, the info. is general without necessarily in depth."
4,A great book to get you started...,"This book is an entirely useful and practical guide to getting started in the world of motorcycles. It is full of relevant information including topics such as motorcycling history, chosing your first bike, safety, routine maintenance, etc. It's an all-around solid resource for those who have the ""itch."""
2,"This is not a book for ""Idiot""!","If you know the terms, as ""cam"", ""head"", etc. You have no need to read this book. If you don't, you still don't know what they are!!Need more pictures, as my son use to say I amnot ready for the ""chapter book"", I want to read ""picture book""."
2,I wasn't overly impressed.,"The idea, and the effort behind this book was good, however, I found the writing style very hard to follow. The author used several terms before defining them, and some of the definitions were a little iffy at that. There were also some places where the information seemed confusing and maybe even wrong. For example the author refered to a kickstarter being on the left side of a motorcycle, then on the right. In several chapters I felt that the important subjects were glanced over in a paragraph or two, and at other times too much detail on something was given. I have about 15 books on various aspects of motorcycling, and this was the first book I have returned. [as motorcycle instructor, I want to be able to recommend good books to my students when they ask, therefore I try to keep up with current motorcycle related books] As I said, the author had good intentions, but the book felt rushed, as if he had a deadline and couldn't smooth things out in time."
4,A great introduction,"Like most ""Idiot"" books, this is a great introduction. Not a lot of depth in some places, but that is better left to specific subject books. What this book does well is get you acquainted with terms and different varieties of bikes so that you can avoid making a complete fool of yourself. Also gives good resources for further education. You wouldn't want this to be your only bike book, but it is a good place to start."
4,If one book needs to cover basics...,"... then there is worse than this one. The author's preferences shine through (and make good and/or fun reading), other than that, a useful and entertaining read for beginners who will still select the bike they want regardless of what the author says, and why not a good book for people who've been riding a long time because a basic refresher course has never hurt anyone. From a tangent, this book is all the basic articles rolled into one. Of course, the author does not talk enough about Guzzi's Cali II, but that might be a personal point of view. Have fun, wear a helmet, ride free."
4,Buying a motorcycle? Buy this first!,"Excellent book for the motorcycle novice. Even though I am from Australia and the book is clearly written for a U.S. audience, I found it told me almost everything I needed to know about choosing a bike, buying a bike, and then keeping it going."
2,Dog doesn't care for the flavor,I have even tried wrapping it in bacon and ground beef and she will reject the pill and eat the rest.
2,Not exactly what I ordered,"What is pictured & what I believed I ordered, is not what I received. Same brand, but different looking bottle, not time released like said on bottle in picture & in description. I do not like that I have to cut each tablet in half (she weighs 25lbs.) & give it to her at morning & night mealtimes. Tablets are not easy to cut & majority crumble when you do try to cut them. I previously purchased these, from another website & received what I ordered (with time release & just had to give her 1 whole tablet in the morning) and it definately works for my dog. I compared my previous bottle to the bottle I just received & 3 ingredients are different between the two. So, this product DOES work well for her arthritis, just disappointed in what I was sent. The reason I didn't return it...by the time I received this one, her other bottle was empty!"
2,I expected more.,"For the money I expected more. This product has an ""inkjet"" cover and very little besides songs after the bad beginning."
5,Absolute Beginner,"This is the place to start playing guitar. If you want to learn to strum along and sing your favorite songs, then start here. You will use the information learned from these lessons to apply to your future playing for years to come. Not to mention you will have about 80 songs that are fun to learn new strum techniques with. What a blast to be able to sit down and finger pick an accompanyment for a new song you're learning and know it all started here. Do yourself a favor and buy these lessons if you want to have fun with your guitar."
2,Strum & Learn (Not Exactly),"I bought this book and expected a bit more. However, my motivation was also not exactly ignited because I didn't know most of the songs.On the plus, side the author has a nice soothing voice as he tutors you about the guitar. Maybe, I'll give it another try soon.*Aspired to be a Rock Star. Still can't play the guitar.* (Heard this phrase somewhere, can't recall where?)(I would rate it 2.5 stars overall)"
2,"Hard to follow, hard to get into!","I was reading Life among the savages for book club. I tried, I really did but on page 80 I could no longer force myself to read this even though I was supposed to be able to discuss it at book club. My understanding is that the story is really a cool one and very interesting which I can't attest to because I couldn't make myself read it. The writing style was VERY hard to follow. There was a comma about every 5 words which changed from one subject to the next and then finally would end up back where you started. The one person at bookclub that liked it, ironically the girl that chose it, says that's the way she thinks so it was easy for her to follow but for the general person it was a bit to here-and-there-and-there-and-here. I think the story would have been good though and I might just go for the cliff-notes."
4,Pretty Good Work,"Jesse Powell has a great voice therefore whatever he sings usually turns out good. I don't like all the music here, but overall it's a good release. My favorite is ""IF"". His vocals are tremendous on this cut. This album is a pretty good buy."
3,JP,"I think that this is Jesse Powell's best album to date. It has been a while since his last album which was good, however he has really out done his self this time."
2,FALLING FURTHER & FURTHER OFF...,"jesses self titled debut was incredible. his 2nd album ""bout it"" was okay, although a bit ordinary.his 3rd album is mostly bad. too many songs are over the top mush, the production is extremely poor and low budget, the casio keyboard sounds badly dated when compared to more legitimate artists who utilise REAL instruments.sorry, but there is too little variation in sounds, and the songs are repetitive. jesse still has a great voice, but could use some restraint.there are a few gems, ""on your mind"" is about wishing you could get a certain someones attention, ""after we make love"" is inspired, relating to whether you would ruin a friendship by sleeping with a friend you suddenly find attractive, and the finale ""something in the past"".whether jesse will ever match his debut is questionable, unfortunately."
3,"FLAWED BUT ""OKAY""","Jesse definately has an impressive voice. One of my faviroute voices to listen to in all of rnb infact.this album is flawed, the first few songs aren't very good, and since first impression count, i was already plotting my refund at this point of listening.Thankfully things pick up, and this is an okay album. Jesse has a good voice which is good to listen to, BUT he doesnt really showcase the full range of his vocals throughout this album, unlike his self titled debut of 1996.the production is also quite bland and limited on this album. it would be nice to hear something with more of a dense, deeper feel than the dull limited sounds of a keyboard.If u dont have a jp album yet DONT start on this one, id recommend ""bout it"", which is full of catchy stuff, but ""jesse powell"" is also good(especially for hearing his voice), although his style has changed since those days."
2,OK Change From Metal Brushes,"These have a very different feel from the metal brushes I have used, but they have some practical advantages.One minor downside on this particular set was that the end caps came off in my hands as soon as I started playing. They were very poorly glued on, but remounting with more and better glue solved this problem. I did not experience this with another set I bought."
5,Zyliss Cook-N-Serve Tongs (assorted colors),"What can you say about an item like this Zyliss Cook-N-Serve Tongs (assorted colors), it works well and is comfortable to hold."
5,Works Great On Bacon,"I bought these tongs for one reason and one reason only, to cook bacon. And for that purpose they work great. No problems what so ever picking up slices of bacon or with the silicone tips melting. I've moved on to trying them on bigger cuts of meat, works great on those to."
5,Great Product,Great product: I love the effective design and locking mechanism. More pleased I could not be. Glad to recommend to friends.
2,Eh,"Product came with design error. The silicone and stainless steel is great but it makes an obnoxious click when I clamp it. Also, the lock is built incorrectly and creates resistance when clamping. Returned."
5,Zyliss Tongs,"Bought the Zyliss Cook-N-Serve tongs based on previous reviews. They are very well built and have worked well. Ordered black and red showed up, but that was not a factor for us."
2,"Good start, but too old to use","This book is a good start for learning VBScript if you are still back in the dark ages, or using IE3.0. I was hoping for a book that would teach many of the updated code tricks for use with IE4.0, but this isn't the book I should have bought."
4,A good introduction,"This is a very helpful book for those who are new to scripting and/or need a review of basic programming practices. The examples are good, and the CD-ROM added a lot to my learning experience. I wish the author had explored more complicated programming problems, however, after he covered the basics. I would also like to see the ASP section expanded."
3,Surprisingly Funny and entertaining,"This movie was shot for less than $20,000 but one would never know. I was pleasantly surprised by the level of professionalism displayed here. Small town North Carolina is represented proudly in the film, via locations, story and a number of volunteer actors. The special effects are extremely good considering the tiny budget.Go into it knowing that the humor is intentional, and you are in for 90 minutes of entertainment. Great soundtrack too, both score and incidental songs. Love that end title tune."
2,"Great when working, but unreliable","As devotees of ultrasonic humidifiers, we snapped up 3 of these units to compete with the forced-air heat. There is a lot to like: large capacity tank, very quiet, fine mist. Unfortunately, I think there is some type of engineering problem with either the ultrasonic transducer or the water-level sensing circuit. We have sent two back for replacement, because they simply quit working -- regardless of the cleaning and demineralizing routine. One replacement failed after two uses. One of the remaining three is now becoming erratic, and the ultrasonic transducer is delaminating. The water demineralizing cartridges are a great idea, and work pretty well, but be aware that they don't prevent all of the mineral dust. Still, use them.So in short, these units are a great idea, but they need some better ruggedizing. My Holmes ultrasonic is 10 years old and still runs fine. You're lucky to get 10 months from these."
3,good value,We recently bought this product for our newborn. Since our purchase she has been able to breathe more freely and the dryness of the air in our house is gone. No more stuffy noses or itchy skin. The only problem is that it is hard to refill the water.
2,Bad odor,"Like some of the other people reviewing this item, ours developed a bad odor after a month of use. I have cleaned the thing thoroughly according to the instructions, but it still smells bad. I cannot find the replacement filter anywhere. It's very good at producing mist, but the room gets saturated with the odor. It's the last time I'll buy a Vicks product."
2,humidifier works well however the smell is awful,"The humidifier works well, it's very quiet. I bought this last year and when I took it out this winter to use it, the smell was profoundly disgusting! I can't find a replacement filter either in case that's what is causing it. I can't use it with the awful smell."
4,"Works well, low hassle maintenance","I've been using this humidifier for more than a year now, and have been very happy with it. It's very quiet for the baby's room, and I haven't had a problem with the white dust, although it's not on 24-7.Advice: be sure to empty and refill the tank and base daily if possible to keep the filter in good shape. And don't leave the water standing in it while you're on vacation- it's nearly impossible to hand scrub the tank- had to buy a flexible bottle brush for that one, lol.I recently needed to replace the water tank (I dropped it and cracked it slightly). I was a little disappointed that they don't offer replacement parts for it. I'll search for a used one so I can keep using it. I am able to find filters for it pretty easily at the place of purchase- Meijer (a Michigan chain).If I can't find a replacement tank, I will probably by a new one just like it."
1,CHEMICAL PNUEMONIA- 6 MONTH OLD BABY!!!,"If I could give ZERO stars I without a doubt would! DO NOT BUY this product. I bought this humidifer for my baby with a cold and he spent 5 days in the hospital and is now home on oxygen because he has chemical pnuemonia!! There was so much ""WHIT DUST"" using this for the first time that you could not see my babies crib!! We followed instructions carefully and were using bottled distilled water. We went to the store we purchased it, got a new one and did an experiment in our basement-- THE SAME THING HAPPEND! This happend 7 weeks ago and it has been a night mare...my perfectly healthy baby has undergone CT SCANs, X-rays, bronchioscopes needing general anesthesia, inhalers, prednisone, lasix---- all to try to make him better. Pulmonologist are stumped at what to do. THIS IS A SCARY PRODUCT----I CALLED THE -1800 number on the box and the women says they will not recall a product over a phone call!!! SCARY!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Not so great for tracheostomy use,"This Vicks ultrasonic humidifier was thoroughly recommended by everyone when we needed a humidifer with the possible hose attachment that goes to a mask around my dad's new tracheostomy. Problem is, it puts out TOO much mist even at the lowest setting! We've tried everything including taping the hole, but it then goes from 'all' to 'nothing' because the small hole desired quickly coalesces water preventing steam from passing through. Of course it wasn't until we started mentioning it to the various RN's that come to take care of my dad that 'everyone' using it for the same purpose complains of the same excessive mist problem. So... I've resorted to making large hole cuts in the plastic tubing leading up to my dad's mask. Not a great way to do it (and just asking to be seeded by bacteria), but if anyone has a better suggestion, I'm all for it, even if it means suggesting a different humidifier..."
1,Broke in 10 minutes,"I bought this item after seeing 5 star reviews and was very disappointed. I took it out the sealed box, filled the tank and it began humidifying beautifully. But, within 10 minutes, the steam ceased to come out and the reservoir at the bottom leaked all over my carpet. I removed the tank, emptied the reservoir and tried again with the same result. I put the piece of junk back in the box and returned it to the store. I would NOT recommend this item."
2,Not as good as I had hoped!,"The unit stopped working after three days. I spent a long time on the phone waiting for KAZ customer service and they just told me to return it to where I purchased it from. The unit was also louder (especially when the water tank was low), than my Douglas ultrasonic humidifier (that still works after about 10 years). I use Reverse Osmosis water in the humidifier, so the white mineral dust is not a problem for me. I will try the Venta Sonic next."
2,A little too noisy,"The unit seemed to work well, and produced a nice vapor, but we bought it for bedroom use and it was just too noisy. It produced a high pitched whine which was uncomfortable. I could hear it from adjacent rooms. We tried it in the TV room where our Christmas Tree is and it worked better there but it we could still hear it so we returned the unit."
2,"Works fine, for a while",I had the same problem with the ultrasonic transducer just quitting after a year. Probably done buying Vicks as this is the second humidifier that died after a short life on me.
2,Unit after a few months smells like fish,"This humidifer did very well the first few months, then it started smelling like fish. I cleaned the unit and bought a new filter, but it didnt do any good. Had to throw the unit out."
1,"DON""T BUY!","I bought two of these due to the reviews. They don't work! I had to send one back which was so noisy, they replaced but even if you clean these everyday, in the middle of the night they stop working. When they say sensitive to things in the water they are NOT kidding. I have never had a humidifier that needs so much work to get it to operate. quiet yes, but half the time not putting out the steam. Stick to Holmes units"
2,Vicks Ultrasonic Humidifiers aren't what they're cut out to be!!,"I recently purchased 2 Vicks Ultrasonic Humidifiers in Jan 2006 and received them by the 3rd week of Jan 06. On 2 Feb 06 (having used them only 2 weeks) one of them stopped putting out the humidifying vapor. I followed the manual's instructions to the letter by cleaning the tank with bleach and the base I used vinegar to clean what white dust (if any since I'm using the cartridge)it might have. Having followed the manual instructions to the letter, the humidifier turns on but there is no mist coming out of the mist nozzle. I plan in contacting the manufacturer for a replacement or refund. Good luck to those of you who are considering in purchasing a Vicks Ultrasonic Humidifier!"
2,WHISPER quiet it is NOT!!!,"Well it says on the box that it is whisper quiet, and it was at first, untill a couple of days later it stated to be really loud and gets louder gradulaly. Sometime we don;t hve this problem, but most of the time after while of it beening on it becomes quite annoying, so I turn it off. Its good if you don;t mind loud repetive noise, I want another one and will probably end up getting a differnt one sometime down the road."
2,Smell,"I suppose the operation of the unit works fine, we have no complaints there. We are concerned with the smell that the unit outputs. We have extreamly hard water and are using the demin. filter that came with the unit. As soon as we started the humidifier, there was a sharp smell coming out with the vapors. Has anyone else experienced this or knows how to clean/ fix it?"
1,CAUTION--DO NOT BUY,"This product must have some sort of defect. I am on my third Kaz humidifier this winter so far. This one in particular is better than the other two--I have also had two of the personal-sized units, do not even bother with those--but it is a hassle to use, the cartridges are not available anywhere at the moment to buy and the air it blows has a strage odor to it. The only good thing I can say about this company is that they are pretty good with customer service. I have sent two units back to them that they have replaced after I paid for shipping and they cast several rude comments my way suggesting that I was the one who was operating it incorrectly. Go with another company. Holmes makes a much better product."
3,"OK, not great. Not silent, either.","(1) Bought this humidifier advertised as ""silent."" Silent to me means that it doesn't make noise, and not having owned a humidifier before that's what I expected. It's not LOUD but it makes noise. (2) Covered every single thing in my room with white dust the first day. Gross. (3) Gets really dirty inside the unit and you have to clean it. (4) It BROKE! Stopped working suddenly, no power at all after 10 months. Kaz will replace it but I have to ship the whole mess myself which will probably cost a pretty penny, and the replacement won't arrive for 4-6 weeks. (5) I will be looking for a different model."
2,"Looks Good, Needs A Lot of Attention","Brought this home and immediately there are problems: it will only work if the unit is tilted. So I put a napkin folded up under one side it works..but seems a little silly. There is some sensor in there that needs to be in contact with water and somehow mine only works with the ""leaning tower"" approach..avoid this one!"
2,RETURNED 3 TIMES!,"THE WATER DOES NOT SEEM TO DRAIN PROPERLY INTO THE BASE. AFTER INSERTING THE TOP PORTION INTO THE BOTTOM, ONLY A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF WATER WOULD FLOW INTO THE BASE. I EXCHANGED IT AND HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THE NEXT ONE. SO I DECIDED TO DRAIN THE WATER BY HAND AND THEN TURN IT ON. WORKED OKAY BUT WAS A PAIN AND STOPPED WORKING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. SO I DECIDED TO TRY YET ANOTHER ONE. ONLY TO COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT MUST BE A PRODUCT DEFECT. I NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH MY HOLMES ULTRASONIC HUMIDIFIER!!"
5,Better than expected,"I decided to purchase the motor drives to try some longer exposure astrophotography. I thought they would be fairly accurate but was surprised at how well they tracked. I did take care in aligning the mount to the celestial pole, which definitely must have helped. This morning using an 8mm eyepiece(125X)I centered Jupiter in my field of view and started tracking. Twenty minutes later Jupiter was still centered in my field of view. If it can accurately track for 20 minutes I am sure it will be great for 20-30 second exposures. The only thing that could be better would be a faster rapid mode for finding your objects."
1,Rick D,This is a poor quality hose. The hose itself is very thin and the fittings are a soft plastic. I won't be ordering Apache brand again.
3,"good, BUT","Very neat watch, great visibility and accurate tide display, BUT it does not show the tide height, like comparable models, e.g. Nixon or the Freestyle Tide 3.0. Hence, if you use it for surfing, I would go with the newer models. Other than that, it's a solid watch with a great design and feeling on your wrist."
2,Play script not a book,I was wanting to read the book but what arrived was a play script. I guess I should have research more before ordering. Lessons are always to be learned buyer beware.
2,Caution,"Hey people: I love Rick Rude as much as the other fans who wrote the comments, but this video is ONLY 30 MINUTES LONG.If you want to know more about the bits & pieces of matches, read the first comment."
5,"Fond memories, these classics never die.","I love these tumblers, I hadn't used ones like these since about 30+ years ago as a kid. I remember the aluminum gave everything a better taste and that still holds true today. These are great stackable cups that hold quite a lot. They're lightweight and if you want a cold drink just put them in the freezer for a few minutes and it's like having ice cubes in your drink (just don't add ice cubes as they will stick to the metal when cold!).It's nice to enjoy a cold drink in only a couple of minutes that will taste so much better from these cups. They will last forever too."
4,I really like these,I bought these to keep my iced tea cold during the hot summer months. They seem to work well and I have not had any problems with them. The only negatives are that they need to be hand washed and I do wish they made a larger size. Overall I am very happy with them.
1,Blast from the past!!,"I love the aluminum tumblers,they are a bit expensive,but I wanted them and am happy I bought them.It reminds me of days gone by :)..My granddaughter had never had a drink from an aluminum tumbler and was very surprised at how cold it was.."
1,Sorry not happy,I have never washed in dishwasher but the color has come off and the cups look so bad. Sorry I wish I hadn't gotten them.
3,aluminum BRIGHT tumblers,I really enjoy the sleek shape and great bright colors. They are rather thin aluminum. .That's disappointing. I hope they are not dangerous to my health. Retro and I hope reasonably safe. I use infrequently; but like to look at them.
4,An unusual & worthwhile collection?,"I first read one of her stories in Dozois 14th annual year's best sf. As good as the stuff selling well. A little more fantasyish than I like though. I hear she's better in short form so if you like her novels you might like this collection even more. She struck me as being kind-of like McHugh with a dash of Cordwainer Smith (Although no-one can write in Cordwainer's unique style) & a New Zealander/German flavor. Since she started in NZ & now lives in Germany it fits. Also ,despite the title, I don't remember her being as dark as McHugh. For her sake it is unfortunate that people don't read shorts much anymore. As with everything, you should make your own judgements about this collection."
5,Tricked,"If you enjoy dog shows or are a Newfie fancier, I would highly recommend this book. A fun look at dog shows and the friendships formed by those with a shared interest, seen through the eyes of the average owner-handler. The plot of the book was a little forced, but the details made up for it. A fun read on a rainy day or while killing time at the show grounds."
5,van,"I found this book to be very enjoyable. I am also a dog owner and lover and found the entire story irresistible. It was written in such a manner that you felt you were there participating in the antics of the Emma and Joanie and loving every minute of it. Keeping in mind that this is a fictional work intended for entertainment and not a textbook, it was written as the characters could actually have been speaking. Everyone on my staff has read this book and its sequel. We all enjoyed it immensely. As a Senior Administrative Executive, it is my opinion that for a first time author, this book was well done and met the objective it was intended for - entertainment. Keep up the good work and we are all looking forward to the Cole's next adventure.Furthermore, I have to disagree with 'newf-lover' whose review, in my opinion, was as poorly written as she/he claimed the book was as well as an apparant personal attack on the author."
1,Tricked into Buying this Book,"I have to agree with the prior 1-star reviewer. I'm a big lover of dog related mysteries and Newfies are one of my favorite breeds. The publisher of this book is Authorhouse - a place for writers to self publish. Clearly this publisher does not offer editing services or, if they do, they are shoddy ones or this author didn't take advantage of them. Sadly this book does not live up to its lovely cover either in plot or writing style."
4,Where are the colors?,"Although this Cleo book is as wonderful and magical as all the others in its story, and on this criteria alone it gets its stars, what it lacks is the amazing colors of all of the other Cleo books. Caroline Mockford's illustrations are typically filled with rich, saturated, jewel tones, and this book's colors are muted and somewhat depressing. Now, I understand that it is a winter book, but still, my son and I find ourselves drawn to other editions."
3,Full of misprints,"I didn't agree with the way some of these songs were tabbed out , the power chord progressions are correct from what i've played , but the solos are wrong and full of misprints. But if you wanna learn to play any of the Sex Pistol's songs , then this is a descent book to pick up , but I had to write in alot of corrections."
4,Good game!,"I think this version is better than the next one, 2008... but it seems that 2009 version will be greater!!"
3,Konami makers got to make the next one better for the Xbox 360,I played the game for PS2 and Xbox 360 and I got say it better for the PS2 because it had all the Stadiums. Also you can make player tranfers. For the 360 the graphices good but it could be better. For the next Winning Eleven for 360 they need a couple of things 1.Need all the stadiums 2. Player Tranfer 3. Player Jersey moving separate from body and Player Jersey get dirty when sliding 4.You and a friend can make a league online like the EPL. If they fix those things then the game will be perfect to me and couple other die hard soccer fans
4,review after playing for 2 hours,"i've been a long time fun of Winning Eleven, since the super FC ago 10 years ago.this game is hard, and for beginner, please don't play in ""regular"" mode, it's too hard to score a goal.the graphics is great on my 50"" HDTV.reason for 4 stars?i didn't get the WOW factor after spending so much for a XBox360 and this game. the game play itself (AI) is not that much better after 10 years. if you've playing Winning Eleven prior version, you know what i mean."
4,Soccer games at their best,"Simply put this series has been a tremendous hit since they started, winnig eleven has converted many FIFA aficionados because of their graphics and specially because of the game play....if u liked SuperStar Soccer for Nintendo 64 then you should follow your gut and play Winning Elven any time you can."
2,It was a Pitty to Wait so Long for This,"It was a [...] that for die hard fans of this Konami game, they would lauch this version for the X Box 360. I have been playing the PES games for about 6 years, and I just cann't understand how they can leave out the Edit Mode, I mean you cann't put the players you like in the team you like or chance the faces, names and other aspects of the players.I had to buy a PS2 again, just to continue playing the PES game that I love, because in the PS2 and PSP versions you can find the COMPLETE EDIT MODE. Why? Did they rush this game for the X Box 360? I cann't understand it.Hope next time they complete the game, and not leave us with half the game we were expecting."
2,Fell asleep during each one of the mini-stories,Note: This is a Britsh rendition of CIA/KGB interactions. And almost doesn't cover anything exciting..... Keep your coffee close by to watch this set of stories... Over of the different stories the last one was the best and raises the star rating from 1 to 2.
3,hard to replace headphones,"this mp3 player, while is light weight and easy to carry... has one flaw.. the headphones are not the common size as all mp3 players.. it takes a smaller size headphone jack which most places don't carry. I couldnt walk into future shop or wal mart and pick a pair off the rack.. I had to go to an audio store that specializes and pay a fortune for the right size headphone.. almost as much as what I payed for the player."
3,Not vintage Sonny.,"They could have left Roy Orbison off this CD, but one must sacrifice to get to Sonny. This isn't the Sonny James of the 1950s, but good listening never the less. Would like to hear from SJ fans"
2,Nutcracker,"Not my favorite arrangement of the music. I prefer more classical, orchestral performances true to the intended sounds by the author. I guess I'm just old-fashioned!"
1,These magnificent gorgeous creatures deserve our protection.,Of course I haven't purchased this DVD but I want to review this dreadful item objectively. Polar bears are absolutely adorable when cubs. They are spectacular when adults. These precious creatures don't wantonly and irresponsibly reproduce the way we humans do. Nor do they destroy the environment the way we humans do. Polar bears deserve all the suppoprt and respect they can get. They deserve protection.
4,A tool not a toy,The product works as it intended toIt work for what I needed it to do as a contractor to me it is not a toy bit a tool
4,Pin Extractor,"It is a nice extractor. It seems very durable and I expect it to last for a while. Not a toy though, it should be reclassified."
5,inexpensive scrub solution,"Great price, acceptable product. I would like a recyleable non plastic container though, or at least the choice for such a container. The container is an acceptable and usable container."
4,Great stuff for wounds,"This is a very inexpensive cleanser for wounds.It works well in treating cuts and in my opinion is a betteralternative to creams that stay greasy.The downside is that it does stain where applied a bit of an orangish color.The lid is prone to breakage, so treat it with care. Mine arrived broken.I seem to get stuck a lot, but don't bleed much at all ;-)"
3,works but not what I was expecting,i was looking for a betadine scrub. this is too thin and doesnt foam well. its ok but i was hoping for more of a scrub not a solution.
3,"Wish they'd re-release it in their ""Gold"" series","This sounds like a great collection, but I wish Universal (I think) would release this as part of their double-disc ""Gold"" series like they did for the Supremes, etc. The Gold series look like the best (most complete) greatest-hits CD's they have released, & for about $15 less than the price shown here. This has several Diana Ross tracks I have not heard in many years & have looked for, for years. If they can do ""Gold"" for the Supremes, why not for solo Diana Ross?"
4,Fine Clamp but needs a couple of accessories,"This is a good, well made and designed clamp. After reading previous reviews, I decided to purchase one. My biggest surprise is that I rarely use it. I weld a considerable amount of square tubing and angle together forming 45 and 90 degree weldments. This clamp is great if the length of the materials you are joining is 10"" or shorter. I am joining materials as long as 20 feet in length and this requires a support guide on the material ends opposite the clamp that is exactly the same height as the clamp base. If these ends are not properly supported the wedment will not be square. These two supports could be L shaped to accomodate different sizes and built with the same materials as the clamp base."
5,This is one of the finest books I've ever read.,"It is a shame that Amazon.com has to put on-line the review by Kirkus. I don't know who wrote it--he didn't sign his name--but I wouldn't be surprised if it was a jealous, inferior writer lashing out with his tiny pen.The shame is this: Wandering Time is a fine book. A great book. One of the best books I have read. Urrea's language has a music all its own. That's as clear as I can say it. He knows the word-music, the secret combination that strings the right sounds together in the right order--turns the language into something better, something sweeter than it is for the rets of us, something delicious.The Kirkus review sounds an awful lot like what they said about Mozart. In that regard it is appropriate. But in no other way."
3,"Fun, but not as good as a fork","My husband has been making gnocchi since he was a kid, taught by his wonderful Italian nonna (grandmother)! I thought this would make a fun gift for him and he was anxious to try it. It did make for fast rolling, but the ridges were not as deep as a fork and closer together. After rolling a batch of gnocchi's with this board, we rerolled them with a fork. Gnocchi's need good deep ridges to hold the sauce and to keep from sticking together. This board isn't as good as a fork.The quality of the product is good, though. Nice and sturdy. It just needs deeper ridges that are more spread out."
5,NICE,"AWESOME! Her first single is VERY COOL! Good to listen, I enjoy it a lot. She has a very strong and powerful voice. Money is completely worth it! Buy It!"
3,Great Reggaeton,"I enjoy the reggaton songs on this album, but the ballad songs do absolutely nothing for me. She does have a wonderful strong voice, but to see people comparing her to Christina and Beyonce, sorry, but they were made for ballads and Shakira is in a totally different ballgame herself. You can't compare her style (meaning Shakira) because no one else has her style which is why she is so successful. If you are a reggaton fan, I think you will her songs and I hope she continues to make more albums geared towards that genre of music and upbeat latin. I don't enjoy her voice at all in ballad form."
5,Absolutely Amazing,This album is a must buy for anyone who appreciates good musical talent. This band unites heavy distorted rhythm with intricate guitar and drum work along with an amazing vocal performance from Mark Salomon (both lyrically and musically) to create an amazingly beautiful piece of ear candy.
4,Take A Stand Against Obama,Great flag - it really stands out. I have it posted about 15' above my sidewalk on an oak tree. People often ask me what it stands for. I give them the history behind the flag and what it stands for today.
4,"Nice flag, good price, prompt service.","Seems to be good quality and it was delivered promptly. I appreciate the bumper sticker, too. I don't think I was expecting it."
2,Harry's War,"The book revealed little or nothing about the author's terror of flying his thirty-five missions--both over the Hump and from The Marianna's to Japan. Also there is next to nothing on experiences over the targets. Finally, absolutely nothing on the war's aftermath for the author. He just arrives home gloriously -- and that's it. The reader is left in the lurch, so to speak.I'd recommend ""Bringing the Thunder"" for B-29 experiences."
4,Good 'ol Ghoti Hook.,"In Ghoti Hook's sophomore release they put out another zany, energy filled, Punk Rock funfest. Granted, this is not their best work, but it is still very fun to listen to. Another thing, I know Ghoti Hook's lyrics are anything but serious, but that is part of thier style that I like so much. If they were to turn into another serious Punk band I would be angry. I mean there are tons awesome serious Punk bands out there that I love. But Ghoti Hook's uniquely hilarious style of music has it's place in the industry. I mean, think about it....is there any other band like Ghoti Hook? Simply answered, no there isn't."
3,its OK,"its good music, but the lyrics and the way they sing is annoying. I also dont understand all these ""the box"" songs that they put in there, and why they have that spanish thing for track 10"
2,A real disappointment after Sumo Surprise.,This album lacked the quality and talent of this bands capability. But I highly recommend SUMO SURPRISE!!!!
5,This is one for the record books!,"If you like punk, this is for you. I went to one of their conserts once it was awesome. I some music you can really mosh to."
3,Not all that good,"Y'know, i like a lot of Ghoti Hook's stuff, but this album was just not up there. Many of their songs had absolutely no point at all--even though im sure that was intentional, they are very goofy -- and their lyrics and delivery were disappointing. I got this album expecting a lot, and was left with next to nothing."
2,Foolishness. That's all. Pure foolishness.,"Ghoti Hook has a decent sound, but too often their music has no meaning. What the heck is the point of a song called ""Banana Man""? Or ""My Bike""? It's just dumb, period!"
2,Non Fiction,"The Spaceflight Manual is a look at the practicalities of space travel from your average person's point of view, and how likely it would be, at the time it was published, that you would be able to go into space in the near future for a look around, and at the technologies and economics involved."
1,Flesh Feast,"I have a 4 pak called Flesh Feast with these same films. Let's take each film one by one:Slave of the Cannibal God-Stacy Keach and original Bond Girl Ursula Andrews. This film was a pretty good adventure film. Some great scenery and pretty enjoyable. 3 starsThe Severed Arm-Not bad, pretty funny and pretty corney but that is ok. 2 starsI eat your skin-Silly fun movie that takes place on a fictional island where voodoo creates the living dead. 2 starsThe Undertaker and His Pals- Now this is a funny movie. And like someone else stated the Hip Thrusting still has me wondering as well, but that is the silly comedy of this film. The opening scene where the picture of the sailor changes from happy to shock as he sees his girlfriend murdered was creative and funny. I give this film 3 stars. Overall I give the pak 3 stars, would only recommend for people who like silly, creative older films."
1,"ONE SHAKY STEP FORWARD, TWO STUMBLES TO THE REAR","What we get here is the camp cult classic, ""The Undertaker and His Pals"", and two pieces of junk that are not worth the time at all.The ""Undertaker"" gives us a comedic slash and gore romp through low budget filmdom that at times is almost worth the watch; watch it anyway. The plot: A greasy spoon diner and a mortuary encounter harsh financial times and decide to collude in an endeavor to drum up business. They go out at night and kill people. The funeral parlor gets the mortuary business and ships the corpse next door to be served up next day on the blue plate special. More inane shenanigans ensue, they are not worth the going into here, and fans of bad movies should'nt miss this one."
4,Great ideas for do- it- yourself parties,"This book is organized according to different party themes that children will like, such as Wizard of Oz, Mother Goose and All Aboard. Within each party, the author gives you multiple creative ideas for creating your own invitations, decorations, activites and games, refreshments, cake decorating and party favors. The author also tells you how to draw the children into the party theme and keep them busy and interested. This book is great for someone who wants to make an old fashioned at-home party for their child. The author's ideas are easy to put to use. I made a Globe Trotting party for my 9 year old son...it was a big hit! This book will serve as a handy reference for many years of birthdays."
3,Takes a while to get going,"I was so excited to pick up this book due to my love of medical based thrillers. However, I found this book to be one of those that's ""hard to get into"".The first half of the book was just OK and I found myself making myself read it. The main character seemed to be on the outside looking in rather than invovled in the story. Things just weren't happening to him like you would expect in a ""thriller"". Finally at page 153 things started happening and after that I was liking the book a little more.The ending was well written and a great salvage to what I thought would be a downer of a book. I just wish the book would have grabbed me a little sooner than halfway through."
3,Slow Starter,"Dr. Earl Garnet is the Chief of the ER in St. Paul's Hospital in Buffalo New York. St. Paul's is suffering money problems, then the Chief Administrator is murdered in the hospital. The first half of this book drags a bit. Too much time is spent on Dr. Garnet's internal angst. He is worried about being a suspect/target. He is worried one of his staff is a murderer. And he goes over these thoughts again and again. Then the story comes together and moves along at rapid, action filled pace. The ending is a real corker. Worth the effort."
3,I Wish I Knew,I purchased this book thinking that it was a christian medical thriller. I saw that one of his books was and it was my error that I didn't check this one before purchasing. I have not read it nor will I because of some of the words I saw in the book. I wish there was a way to find clean books before purchasing them through amazon.I love any type of medical thriller as long as it's clean. I hope this review helps someone in the future.Thank You!
5,Learning from Authority,"A seasoned ""road warrior"" for over 20 years, I thought that I knew all the tricks, but Ms. Barone has included tons of tips I had missed. Precise, concise and accurate, The Travel Authority is a great checklist for the professional traveler, and could save hundreds of dollars for anyone traveling abroad."
1,Terrible!,I am not sure who in this company measures standard crib mattresses but they need a new measuring tape. There was NO way I was getting this on my standard size mattress. Don't be fooled by the package saying it fits all standards - NOT TRUE!!! I would have given it 0 stars if that were an option.
3,Haven't bought it,Wanted to thank the person who wrote a review about it not fiting their ultra sealy mattress. You saved me the frustration as I have the same one!!
1,Skip this one...,"I registered for this because of the Carter's brand - and their reputation for quality. I got one as a shower gift and decided to wash it before the baby arrived. I snagged the side of it (putting a small hole in it) trying it on the mattress prior to use with my fingernail (which is not ragged at all), but decided to keep it. It went thru the wash fine, but after pulling it out of the dryer - which was set on low and full of other items from the wash (socks, towels, t-shirts) - I noticed that the plastic on the back had holes in it and the material on the sides had started to 'melt' together in bunches. I haven't even tried to fit it on the mattress, because it is going straight back to Babies R Us and another brand purchased. Perhaps not drying it at all would be ok, but sometimes that's just not an option."
1,doesn't fit and is useless,"I did wash and dry the pad before using it, but after reading the other reviews I don't know if would have made much difference if I hadn't. It actually ripped!! There's no way to use it now. Besides, it is useless if you can't wash it without it shrinking."
1,Horrible,"I didn't read the reviews first. I guess it was pretty stupid to assume a standard mattress pad would fit a standard mattress. I never even got one use out of it. In other words, DO NOT BUY."
1,Don't bother to buy- Way too small,"This is the second mattress pad I've had to buy and return. I started with the Especially For Baby Water Resistant Pad, washed it once and the quilting came apart around the entire pad. Then bought this pad, should have read reviews first, but there is no way possible for this pad to fit a standard crib mattress. Obviously this product is defective but Babies R Us continues to sell it anyway. I guess quality is of no concern to them."
1,Too short...,"I also found this mattress pad too short. I was using a firm foam mattress in my baby's crib, and the pad was so snug it actually reshaped the foam, leaving unsafe gaps around the mattress. For this reason I was never able to use the mattress pad at all.BTW, I did prewash before trying it on the mattress, but never put it in the dryer, so it wasn't a shrinkage issue. It was too small to start with."
1,Frustrated Crib Maker,"The mattress pad seems to be fine in general, however it does not fit on a standard crib mattress. The ends are too short and therefore does not lie flat. Would not recommend buying this one!"
5,Fit my standard crib mattress...,"I'm not sure why other people are having so much trouble with this product. It fits our standard crib mattress great! We got two so we'd have one clean while one is in the wash. It's definitely quite snug, but it needs to be so it won't slide around under the sheet. We've owned and used ours for 2 1/2 years now, and they're still working great even after plenty of washings."
1,Thought this would be great,"Had purchased a waterproof mattress pad for my grandsons crib and washed it the first time, just like the washing instructions and it came out with holes in it.Not at all impressed!"
1,Too small,"I received this from a registry and washed and was ready to put on the standard size crib mattress - assuming it would fit. However, it was way too small. My husband tried and it ended up tearing on the sides - as he was a bit too ambitious. The pad is great, but it needs to be longer and sides need to be made of more durable material."
2,Too hard to put on,"I received two of these mattress pads as shower gifts, and washed & dried them with the crib sheets. I planned to double-make the bed (pad, sheet, pad, sheet so I could just remove one layer if the sheets were soiled in the middle of the night, and have a fresh set underneath). I struggled for a good 10 minutes to get this pad on my Simmons mattress! I finally did it, and it's nice and snug. I even got the second layer on, but I ripped one of the corners accidentally. (It's still quite usable though.) Next time I'll look for a different brand with stretchier sides.I do have to say, though, that it's not going anywhere once you get it on! No slipping & sliding to worry about."
1,Fell apart before I could use it.,"I received one of these from my registry. In preparation for the arrival, I washed it with Dreft, following all the care instructions. When I removed it from the washer, it had a hole in one corner that was jagged and 8 inches wide. Needless to say, I will be returning this item and finding a different brand to purchase. Maybe spending a little extra will provide me with a quality mattress pad?"
2,"fits great, but falls apart!!!","This pad fit perfectly on our crib mattress and held up great for 2 months. After several days of washing it each day, i purchased a 2nd one. Shortly thereafter the plastic on the 1st one fell apart. And after having the 2nd for only a few weeks, that one fell apart, too! i machine washed and tumbled dry on low, just as the directions say. Today i bought the ""especially for baby"" pad, but it doesn't fit tightly on the mattress."
2,too short,"It's supposed to meet the 28*52 mattress. But after I tried 10 min to put it on my searly ultra mattress, I realized the pad is too short. It couldn't fit every corner of the mattress as the picture show and the surface is bubbled not very flat. not in a good quality."
1,Melted in dryer on low/delicate setting,"I had no problems the first time I washed this mattress pad, but several holes were formed when it melted the second time I washed and dried it. About ten holes opened up along the sides where the polyester melted. I washed and dried it on low/delicate (I even verified this when I saw the holes). It was still damp after the first drying cycle, so I dried it a second time. Perhaps this was too much and made it melt, but a damp mattress pad is of no use to me.I put the pad on the mattress anyway, and some of the holes became larger as I stretched the sides to fit over the mattress. I will probably throw it away soon. I am very disappointed that I only got to use it for a couple of weeks and I do not recommend this mattress pad to anyone."
3,Too Short for the mattress,"I wish I had read the reviews about this before I registered for it. It does not fit too well after the first washing. Comes up short on both ends. Other than fit, the product is good, but let's face it, fit is everything when you're buying a fitted mattress pad!"
1,tear-able,"i bought this for the fitted aspect of the pad and found that everytime i washed it and put it back on the mattress, the elastic would rip apart from the rest of the pad. the first time it happened i didn't think to much of it but then the next time i went to take it off the mattress, all the elastic ripped off from the pad. very poor quality."
3,Do not use in dryer!,"While I did not have any problems with this cover fitting my Sealy mattress, I was however, upset with the washing instructions. The tag says you can lightly dry it on a cool setting, which I did and the pad began to melt after only being in a cool dryer for 10 minutes. I wasn't happy.I have two, and did not dry the second one. It does the job when it comes to protecting the mattress."
1,Melted in the dryer,"I thought this would be great, as I love Carter's items, but the sides melted in the dryer on a low setting and now have multiple holes. I was going to buy another, as I thought I was the one that had done something wrong, but I see I'm not the only one that this has happened to."
2,Do not put in the drier!!,Works okay as long as you don't put it in the drier because it will shrink. Mattress covers are hard enough to get on without having to struggle with one that is too small!
1,Didn't Fit!,"I thought this would be nice and easy, it did fit (finally) but ripped my brand new mattress putting it on because it was sooo tight. Also, my mattress has square corners so no little fingers get down the sides and it completly pushed in the corners (and hence the rip).The mattress was cons. digest best pick...obviously the mattress pad was not. Both that I have are going back tomorrow!"
1,Disappointment,"I am very upset with the fact that the registry was not updated with this product, as well as others - this producted was purchased by more than one person. This is very upsetting & disappointing & makes me re-think purchasing from this mediam again."
3,Not for a Kodak Easyshare Z7590,This doesn't fit my Kodak Easyshare Z7590 camera. My camera has a Variogon 38-380mm lens. (Look on the bottom of the lens on your camera) This adapter is for a 44.2 mm lens not a 38mm lens. Check your camera before ordering.
4,"Similar interpretation, different conclusion.","A previous reviewer described Boy Crazy's album 'Foreign Words' as ""typical dreamy pop with cute lyrics"". I'd generally agree with this assment.However, I didn't find that the tracks ""become rather indistinguisable"" with repeated listening. By contrast, it seemed to me the more I listened the more I found distinctive nuances to the many which set them apart.In particular I found that 'Stark Street' stood out with it's tight blending of theme and smooth composition. Also 'Why Aren't You Free?' really hooked me with earnest lyrics and sweeping melody (part lullaby, part waltz)."
2,"Not really that foreign, but kind of cute","Boycrazy is your typical dreamy pop with cute lyrics. The band consists of Bryce Edwards and Rachel Blumberg of the Minders. The songs have fun beats and dancy bass lines, but after awhile, all tracks (with the exception of ""Bad Things"") become rather indistinguishable from each other. ""Bad Things"" is truly the best song on this album. I love the keyboards and strings, when they use them!"
3,A Dinner of Herbs Movie Review,The first two tapes of the epic were great but the later part of the story told on the third tape didn't seem to fit with the first two. I felt as if i watched two different movies. Overall I enjoyed the film but think that a more fitting actress should have could have been chosen to play the role of the Mary Ellen in her later years!
3,CHANGED ALL THE CHARACTERS IN SECOND PART,"I really liked the first part of A DINNER OF HERBS. So, wasted no time purchasing both parts.Shock! It is the same story like but the characters look and act so differently that I could not get back into the story line.I gave it three stars because the first part is really good."
2,waste of my time,"This tv series was a epic fail and a waste of my time. The 2nd part is like a totally different story. Everything was off and nothing ran smoothly. Warning, don't waste your money or time on this."
3,Snuggle Puppie,Great product - wrong color sent.Provider had a picture of a tan colored Snuggle Puppie indicating color may vary from picture - implying shade variation. Item received in black a color that has greater discounts in price from other vendors at the time. It did not have a battey seal so batteries lasted only a short time. With all that it is a very good product. Contacted provider and they said they only had it(left?) in black.
5,Sleeping Companion,New puppy loves to lay on to sleep. Also loves to chew the tail and ears....very amusing and worth the money.
3,The sound of romance lives and lives again with this cd,"First I would like to offer a great BRAVO to Banu and her gang. You are marvelious! I haven't such a treat in many years. It is so good to know that passionate music has not been forgotten. This music perormed here is out of sight.This is the first cd for me to purchse of Banu and i'm here to tell you it won't be the last. I will probably wind up buying her whole catalog. This is the kind of music that engerizies my soul.Banu seems to have a good voice and really enjoys singing these standards. She seems to be a natural with this style of music. She is a good carryover from the '30s & '40s.The pianists that played on this cd did a good job. One of the pianist for this project, John Sheridan is one of my favorite pianist.The repertoire used for this project was a healthy one. A lot of these songs are my personal favorites.I would like for you to buy this cd and try to go back in time with this music, the music of romance."
5,I'm sorry I only left 3 stars for this before...,"This cd is worthy of 10 stars, I love it it is flawless, liek Banu's voice and pitch. The pianos here are exellent and the songs are perfect. [...] I love this cd, and THANK YOU JESUS for blessing us with Banu's gift of song. She's the best singer in the world and all of her cd's are wonderful! Try this one 1st, why don't you?"
3,Should be renamed 'Pyro-pathetic',"For the greatest band and the nicest, humble bunch of guys; I know them personally--this compliation is not only disappointing,but poorly contived! A better job could've been done to point out not only how determined and hard working but how very talented they are. The director of this piece of work should have used VH1 'storytellers or 'behind the music.' Of course to hear them on the interview, even little bits here and there is atleast something and the running time of 40 minutes--it should be longer!!!"
3,Body and Soul by Phillipe Saisse,"I was a bit disappointed as I expected to hear more mellow tracks as I am used to hearing on the WAVE radio, but it is still overall a good album. Seller was prompt and product was as expected."
5,Superb!,"This is a magnificent jazz CD, both artistically and technically. I have been a Philippe fan for about 5 years, with this being the third of his albums that I've purchased. I have always admired his eclectic blend of songs on each CD. This one is a bit more consistent, yet is remarkably fresh, with incredible phase shifts within some of the songs--a Philippe trademark in my opinion.Don't let the ""Trio"" moniker fool you--the efforts on this CD skillfully punch out contemporary grooves, without betraying the trio instrumentation!! I was playing it in the car (by the way, sounds veerry nice on my Mark Levinson system), and I even caught my adolescent son bobbing his head and tapping his feet while listening to it.I could rave on all day, but this CD is better experienced than discussed. You won't be disappointed!"
5,Best Supertones CD ever,"this is supertones at their best. ska ska ska!!! this cd is sooo raw and good, you have to get it. too bad they had to change their style for the worst."
5,This is the best Supertones cd!,This is the best Supertones CD out of all of em! This is Ska down and dirty! I am a RudeBoy for Christ! I am the Elite Skanker! SKA SKA SKA SKA
5,LETS ROCK!!!!!,"Strike Back is like a ska classic to me. It was one of my first ska cd's and continues to be one of my favs. The intro is awesome and it feels like you're at one of their shows with the rockin' rhythm and bouncy happy music. The message is great too. The chorus to ""Little Man"" really gets me thinkin' when I'm having a bad attitude. This cd is a must ska fan or not!!!!!"
5,haters are morons...,"first, yes 3rd wave ska was a flash in the pan....SO WAS THE FIRST AND SECOND WAVE AS WELL!!! idiots. the first wave (late 50s, jamaica) lasted like 5 years. and the second wave (late 70s, UK) lasted liek 5 years as well. the third wave (mid-late 90s, USA) lasted a good 4-5 years. each wave with a 20 year gap between. we'll see what happenes in 2015 when the 4th wave comes. ska has always been pressent, the ""waves"" just indicate when it got HUGELY popular. this cd is probably the single greatest ska cd composed. period."
2,"Alright, I guess","Not a truly BAD cd, but not a great one, either. It got a lot of listening time the first month I had it, but not much since. The songs just seem to become one long song, with a few outstanding moments in ""Unite,"" ""Little Man"" and ""Caught Inside"", a wicked instrumental. If you really want the best on the Christian ska scene, go with the Insyderz, or even better, Five Iron Frenzy. They have a better grasp on the style. I haven't heard the new one by the OCS yet, but, if the truth be known, I'm in no big hurry."
3,First strike,"This was the first album I heard by these guys, and boys was I hooked. I have played this one over and over, if it was an album the needle would have wore it thin. Resolution is my favorite tune."
5,Awesome!!,"The Supertones are awesome. I saw them in concert once, and it was exactly the same as it was on their tape. Matt is an awesome into the crowd hip-hop singer, and Tony does awsome on bass. The whole thing is underrated."
4,Puts a Smile On Your Face,"Happy happy happy! That's how you will feel when listening to this upbeat music with strong, encouraging lyrics!"
3,God+Ska=ok music,"I previewed this cd at Wal-mart for about 4 seconds before I bought it. All I heard was an ok voice and good horns, so I bought it. And I liked it at first, until I started to listen to the words. It's all uplifting God stuff. Now, don't get me wrong, I believe in God, but I just don't like to rock out to Him. Most Ska is either bitter or pissed off, this Ska is uplifting. If you like Christian music and Ska music then this cd is for you. But if you don't want to feel the need to go to confession after listening to a cd, then skip this disk and this band."
1,I didn't like the in-your-face preaching,"I saw the video for ""Supertones Strike Back"" and thought they looked like they would be a lot of fun. I was wrong. They preached down my throat and made me feel very uncomfortable. They are on a mission to convert people and I think that's pretty nasty the way they are going about it. I wish I knew this before I made the mistake of buying this very weak preachy effort."
3,Nyuck nyuck,"Looks like no-one's responded to my review yet, or even written any other reviews, a YEAR AFTER I posted the last one. Looks like this is one well-loved CD. NOT! By the way, I bumped up my rating for the disc - the last review was too harsh. There are a couple songs that stick in your head on here. Obviously, though, third wave ska (both Christian and non-Christian) was the very definition of a flash in the pan, a fad, latter-day hair metal, etc. Neener neener neener! Looks like no one will ever ""strike back"" at me for these reviews, 'cause they know I speak da troof! Ppppptttt! Grow a brain."
1,Ha ha!,"Hey, wanna buy a copy of this waste of polycarbonate? Buck fifty in the used listings! Bwahahahahaaa! Pretty soon it'll be one cent like the listings for Hanson CDs.If you like ska, get into the Specials, Elvis Costello, first-wave Jamaican ska, rocksteady etc. This is the CHAFF, duders. Get a little taste.(See? I like ska! Pbttttt!)Edit 9/23/06: Shpank me!"
5,Wow my father read it more than 4 times!!,My father really loves this book and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to know Jesus better. I read it myself and love it. It is one of the best christian books out there.Do yourself a favor. Get it!
4,awareness of His presence,"This book centers on reaching an awareness of God's presence in our daily lives. A way to achieve this is discussed and obstacles that may be encountered are addressed. If you are yearning for a closer relationship with the Lord, this book offers a way to do that."
5,absolutely a must,"dont wait to get to heaven to find out what this lady knew about God. This book is required reading for any new Christians, or anyone interested in walking with God"
3,good,"This book is good so far, its practical, u grow as u read. I recently purchased. A good friend. Recommended"
5,Experiencing the depths of Jesus Christ,What a wonderful book. I have read tons of books! But this one has changed the way I see my Lord Jesus Christ. You must...must get this book... It will change your relationship with God.
2,Somewhat lightweight,"Victoria Alexander writes some very good books, and some so-so books. this is one of the so-sos. The premise was good, and certainly roped me in to buying it, but it just fell kinda flat."
3,women of the Bible: Abigail's Story,"This story might give us a little bit of background of what her life might be like before Abigail became David's wife. The Buble did not say much about her except that she kept David from killing her household and after her husband died, then she joined him to be his wife. A little too sensual between her and David although."
4,Abigail helps David,"Abigails family is old and ill. They can no longer takecare of themselves so she secretly makes her dads potteryand sells it in the market. (if they knew a woman made itthey would not buy it).Her brother owes a huge gambling debt to Nabal that hecan never pay. Abigail goes to him and offers marriage topay off the debt. Nabal accepts and she is sent to watchover the shepherds who raise his sheep.It is a lonely, bleak, hard life. In the wilderness she willmeet the future King David. She falls in love with David.Nabal dies. She will give David everything that oncebelonged to Nabal.She will become one of King Davids queens.Suggestion: I would like for you to read QUEEN MAKER..itis about David's 1st wife Queen Michal (she is King Saul'sdaughter.) She hates Abigail. It was written by India Edghill."
5,"Dr.Azeem Alam Khan MBBS(QAU),M.Sc (UK),FACP (USA)","I bought this book and read it in a week.It is a compact,easy to read and simple book with excellent pictures of all the important infectious diseases.Some pictures are very clear and informative.I recommend this book to all the undergraduate and postgraduate medical students."
4,Kenpo Hand Connections,"This DVD was produced in the 1990s, so your not going to get fancy menus or special effects. Still the production quality was good. The form of Kenpo shown is different then the American Kenpo of Ed Parker. I would classify it as an old school approach to Kenpo. The DVD has a good number of techniques which incorporate hard strikes with stand up grappling."
2,Pretensions to be a serious book without substance,"The book is easy reading and articulates many popular perceptions- however it is NOT a serious study that properly analyses today's trends nor does it provide new insights and understanding for tomorrow's market performance. I would not recommend it as a first time primer in economics for lack of sufficient depth and lack of intellectual content. Read it, enjoy it but do not let your investment decisions be influenced by the messages or by the lack thereof in this book."
4,A Good Read!,"Hold on to your hat, money's coming! Brian S. Wesbury argues that a New Era is dawning, marked by increasing returns, entrepreneurial opportunities, and wealth for everyone. Wesbury draws on the last five years' most important economic ideas and takes an optimistic view of the next five years. While technology gurus will do best of all, it sounds like you and all your friends and relations will do well enough to have custom-made golf clubs and two weeks at the beach. This book satisfies several levels, from stock market pointers to useful insights into the U.S. economy. Wesbury engages some of your most commonly held, business school ideas on economics and, if you live in the United States (this is a very U.S.- oriented tome), makes you feel pretty good about your future. We [...] recommend this book to those interested in the stock and bond market, or the connection between the economy and politics. It is particularly useful if you are managing your own portfolio."
2,Economics by anecdote,"This is a cursory review of key macroeconomic themes that are likely to affect investors over the next several years. However, the authors perspective is not terribly well supported by any evidence and is ideologically skewed. His support relies on ""soft"" (i.e., not mathematical or rigorous) ancient economists. Most informed readers will find the conclusions either obvious, cliche, or self-evident. That said, the conclusions are not wrong, but not a paradigm shift of any sort."
2,Know what you buy,"Like my topic says, be sure you know what you buy. Robinson is giving details on how the book was found, compiled, traded, stolen and so fourth around the world. He goes into why it has been covered up for so long, instead of actually getting into what is written in the Gospel of Judas. If you want to know the History of this Gospel, and why it took so long to surface into the public eye, then I highly recommend this book. However, if your looking into the Gospel of Judas itself, what it says, and it's meanings, I would advise a different book."
4,All about Judas,"The first half of this book does a great job examining Judas Iscariot from 3 different angles the Judas of the New Testament Gospels and Acts, what the historical Judas was probably like, and then the way Judas is portrayed as a Gnostic in the newly published Gospel of Judas. This part of the book I found enlightening and an enjoyable read. The last half fully examines every aspect of how the Gospel of Judas came to light through its discovery in Egypt its theft, and the way the dealer tried to get $3 million for it and it ended up in a citibank safe deposit box in New York. The history of the manuscript is a very interesting story in itself. The final summary of the book is that the Gospel of Judas teaches us nothing about the historical Jesus or Judas, it only shows the opinions and imagination of 2nd century Gnostics."
2,"Can you say ""Sour Grapes""?","Can you say ""Sour Grapes""?The author of this book castigates the owners of the ""Gospel of Judas"" for what he deems sensationalization for the purpose of making money. He looks down on those who use such a find to ""win something from it: money, fame, honor, or whatever."" Yet Robinson titles his book ""The Secrets of Judas - The Story of the Misunderstood Disciple and the Lost Gospel"" and times its release just as National Geographic makes its announcement.Since the Robinson book says little about ""The Story of the Misunderstood Disciple and the Lost Gospel"" and spends many words telling us how important Robinson is in the field as well as how many important people he calls by their first names, one can only speculate. This book would seem to be merely an attempt to claim a connection with the find announced for the purpose of winning something from it ... a trait he deplores in others.My advice? Don't bother with this book."
1,Seriously dissapointing,"I expected to find out some of what was actually in the gospel of Judas, the bulk of the book went on and on about preservation, aquisition, and roadblocks to the scholarly examination of the manuscript. I was so disgusted I left the book in a laundromat."
4,A BookLove Review,"Review by Jason LushRead it for the information about archeology and the people who study coptic writings, but not to learn any thing of Judas or the document ""The Gospel of Judas"".Simply put, this is an informative and interesting book, but it has nothing to do with its sensational title. The man Judas is mentioned briefly, but the remainder is about the documents' procurement and the people involved with its translation and preservation.Nothing...nothing of the document itself or any of its content. The spiritual content of this book is no more than any thinking reader of the New Testament could surmise on their own.Good book, over blown title."
1,Shameful,"It is truly sad that a scholar of the alleged caliber of James Robinson has so transparently rushed into print with such a volume.The whole tenor of his work smacks of bitterness that he was excluded from the detailed and meticulous restoration,translation and analysis of the recently discovered Gospel of Judas Iscariot that is so well described in Herb Krosney's ""The Lost Gospel"" (Published by National Geographic).This work does him and his reputation no justice whatsoever and readers would be well advised to buy the National Geographic Volumes if they want to get the full story of this extraordinary find."
2,Hype an a No Show,"Although the audio book is nice to listen to the male voice the digital version tracks are 60 minutes long a apiece, instead of broken up into little 10 minute tracks. Don't buy the digital version of it. Limited cut and paste rights in digital book sucks. The first chapter is definitely worth reading and can be found at: [...]whereas it talks about the gospels.THE JEWISH CHURCH'S ECUMENICAL GOSPEL OF MATTHEW and THE GENTILE CHURCH'S ECUMENICAL GOSPEL OF LUKE. The rest of the book is just the story of why book's text is not available. Only sole text is on page 130;They made sure that they seized him during the prayer. For they were afraid of the people, because he was in all their hands as a prophet. And they approached Judas. They said to him: What are you doing in the Place? Aren't you disciple of Jesus? But he answered them according to their wishes, But Judas took some money. He delivered him over to them."
4,Good air filter... review after 30k mi.,"The K&N; filter is the best bang for your buck because it's washable for reuse and obviously filter better the dirtier it gets. When it gets too dirty, just pop it off, and clean down with a water hose. Only thing is you have to buy the special recharge oil after you clean it. It must be oiled after it's air dried.Only negative I see but not really a problem is the nub at the tip isn't molded like a + (plus/star) shape like the OEM filter. So it doesn't fit into back into the groove inside the oem air box. It just sits on top but is still stable. Otherwise I would of gave it 5 stars."
4,Standard K&N,"Filter does it's job, what more to say? The little rubber attachment point on the small is way too flimsy to work as well as the OEM filter did. But that's not really a major issue it stays where it's supposed to so far."
2,Not what I expected,Wasnt what I was expecting and felt it didn't offer me the information I was looking for to help guide me in an informative manner
4,Wow! Awesome!,"This book was so amazing! The Hidden Arrow of Maether is a very good book and has a great storyline. The characters feel real; their emotions are so humanlike! There are a few words that are difficult to pronounce, and the book has a little bit of violence, but you can really get a magical adventure out of it. It's really cool the way Beaverson doesn't explain all of the questions you might have at the end, but still wraps it all up neatly... maybe this shows that perhaps some questions should never be answered."
5,More help than you expect.,"Dr. Ricci sets a high bar when it comes to solid advice and a deep understanding of the dynamics of families in this stressful situation. It doesn't matter if you initiated the divorce or are just doing what you have to in order to get through. Mom's House, Dad's House will help you as much as it will help your children. Read it before you give it to your children. This book can give you strategies for addressing and resolving the most common problems. You will have answers ready when your children are ready to talk. If a child's first questions are answered fully and without rancor they will come back for more help. This really is a must-read for kids. Charlotte Hardwick, author ofWin Your Child Custody War: Child Custody Help Source Book--A How-To System for People Serious About the Welfare of Their Child (12th Edition)"
5,Great divorce therapy book for kids,"Young children who are experiencing the difficult adjustment to their parents' divorce are assisted with this book. I have used it in my therapy practice, and it is very helpful."
1,Not Worth Your Time!,"Price aside this disk is not worth putting in the time to view it. The other 2 reviews (obviously submitted by the same person) liked Death at Love House,,,unfortunately this movie is not one of the ones on the disc. Dominique is just barely passable and considering the names involved almost a shock,,did they need the money that badly?? Tormented is by far the worst,,pure drawn out crap slow moving poor acting,,a waste!! Carnival has some derivative zombi walks and even jazz zombi dancing but it just cant cut it,,three poor excuses for a ghost genre dvd,,Mine is trashed already."
3,This is an OLD edition...,"Hi. This is the author - take careful note:""Bear & Fish's Pocket Guide to Alternate Tunings for Guitar"" is out of print and unavailable (the original document was destroyed - no further examples will ever exist). Less than 100 copies of the first edition were ever printed.The second edition has spiral binding as the comb proved unworkable. The third edition changed the name to ""Guide to Alternate Tunings for Guitar"" and the fourth edition obtained a ISBN number of 0-9760762-0-9. The fifth edition will again feature a name change to ""Stringbreaker's Notebook"" and features an index of tunings.Visit the alluvial gems website (not permitted to list it here) for details on the current version, or to find the email address to contact me."
3,"nice pictures, bad book design","with a photography book measuring 9x13 inches, one would expect the photographs to take up a healthy percentage of the space on each page. not so with this book. each photo measures under five inches square(infact the page layout is identical to whats on the cover). i suppose the author figured that given the subject matter, each of the photos needed plenty of breathing room. this may be. but in doing so, i feel they have sacrificed the impact and clarity that comes with a larger reproduction.-as well, the photos do get progressively weaker as the book goes on..."
4,Eugene,When I first saw this album on Amazon I did what many people do and read some of the comments. I was disturbed to read by one reviewer that it was knocked out in someones back room using a computer or words to that effect. I thought what the hell anyway I will get it and see for myself. I am delighted to be able to say that it is great. I have reasonably good sound equipment and to my ears the production is very good and the tracks laid down by Eugene are just the best. This is a very good album by a very good artist. Give it a go.
5,excellent,"I was a fan of Jan Brett books when I was little and this book contains all the good characteristics of her books, with a new cultural influence from her visit to China. Beautiful illustrations with hidden pictures in the backgrounds, and introduces new animals through the story."
4,Very nice,"This is a good story, very nice text. I am picky and I'm giving it four stars because the illustrations are a bit confusing for children. The hens aren't easy to tell apart and there isn't much personality to their motions. The girl is portrayed with plenty of personality. It doesn't bug me but I would bet it would be more attractive to children, if the hens showed more personality in the illustrations."
5,Lovely little story,"My kids, 4 and 6, both enjoy this story. Illustrations are wonderful, text is descriptive and best of all it has a very happy ending :)"
4,Love Pietry from the Greatest,"To hear Judi Dench and Michael Williams recite poetry I would swim an ocean. We will never be able to hear Michael do anything better than his collection of works from his life. Their love for their craft, as well as for one another, is wonderful to listen to. Just wish it were available on CD."
2,Small and thus easy to carry for a ready reference.,"That the author loves linens is obvious from her narratives. There are some tips on care and history that are worthwhile. Many of the identifications are misleading, and the prices quoted are most frequently inaccurate. The descriptions, although vague, may be a useful starting point for the novice or casual collector, I would not refer this to anyone as a definitive work, but it is useful as an entry level reference."
2,Bevy of examples covering many styles but inaccurate prices.,"First 28 pages are well-written, lyrical descriptions but not terribly historically informative. While there is an extremely wide range of items shown, many photos are reproductions which lose much in the process.Identification of types is very spotty with even the obvious (hardanger and filet) listed only as drawn work or 'beautifully crocheted corners'. Dating of items seemed fairly accurate but pricing was ""not of this earth"". Most dollar amounts could easily be halved and one collar on page 43 listed at $55-60 I purchased for $8 from a knowledgable dealer.This book is useful as an addendum to the library of a serious collector. It is however, of little value to the novice or student because it lacks identifying criteria and the pictures are not high enough quality to decipher detail."
1,Demob dvd,"This is not a very funny or interesting dvd. The acting, to me, sort of stinks. I would not encourage British comedy fans to bother with this one."
2,Appearance difference.,Lamp looks significantly different than it appears in the picture. Both the base and the shade are much darker than the picture would have you believe. The shade looks white in the picture. In reality it's more tan.
2,Elementary & Shallow,"I must have a dozen books on macro-photography and I'm sorry I purchased it. Unless you don't know what a grey card or aperture or depth of field or lens hoods, types of cameras, etc., etc. you are wasting your money. If you like flowers, try Tony Sweets books or Harold Davis's books, or for a very comprehensive view ""MacroPhotography"" by G. Martin."
5,the best,"what a treat - after looking for years to replace my record ( I am old) and then the broken tape, I found the cd. Driving into work today, I rolled the car windows down and sang all the songs. The construction workers, the garbage men, the other commuters all grinned to see this crazy women singing so loud at 7:30. A GREAT music collection I remember from my childhood in suburbia. I am going to order 6 more now to give as gifts -= oh, maybe make that a gift list of 8."
5,Love Calypso Christmas!!,"Like everybody else, this has been a family favorite for ever! My dad and I especially love this. We have been playing the old 33 album and recoreded it to cassette tape. I am sooooo happy to find it on CD. I purchased several copies for my family a couple years ago. Thank you Sony for releasing this. It is so non traditional yet such a classic for my family!!!"
5,A Caribe' Spin on the Holiday,This album has been a Christmas requirement in our household for as long as I can remember. It's the reason I looked for Bob Marley and the Wailers in the early 70's.The voices are incredible. They are an introduction to the Caribe' way to go about Xmas in de tropics
1,What is with the wet carpet and white dust???,"During the winter, the air in our home is VERY dry so I was not turned off by reviews of this humidifier producing too much moisture. Boy was I wrong! After 3 consecutive days of overnight use, the carpet was drenched AND there was this odd white dust on everything within a 2-3 foot radius of the humidifier! I've used it on and off for the last few months and the results were ALWAYS the same....wet carpet and white dust. Needless to say, I am in the process of looking into humidiers that don't drench carpet or produce white dust."
2,Don't Buy This Humidifier!,"I have used this product in my home for 2 winter seasons and I do not recommend it at all for several reasons. First, the output is way too strong for any size room. The moist air does not disperse easily, ends up falling back down, and produces a puddle of water around the unit. I had to keep 2-3 towels around it to prevent water damage to my hardwood floors. Second, it is too much work to keep clean. The weekly cleanings took over 1/2 hour. And, only the bottom section gets truly cleaned. The top section with the motor has many tight spots where you can see mold growth but not reach it. Third, it is very, very noisy! After using it for 2 winter seasons I just gave up and dumped the two units I owned in the garbage!"
1,HATE IT,"I wish I had the option for 0 stars. This humidifier SOAKS the carpet. I have to use a shower curtain liner to protect my floor, and a towel to soak up all the water. Needless to say, this is very inconvienient. Plus, it makes the room smell funny, and it leaves a white dust over everything. Only this was not warned on the package, only in the manual. I've had it less than a month and it is already making a loud racket. After spending $30, we have to buy something else."
1,keep shopping,"When my daughter got a cold last winter, we bought this model because it was readily available and we needed a humidifier quick. Things I like about this humidifier include: it is cool-mist, easy to fill, and relatively easy to clean. But, the things I dislike far outweigh the good things. Filters are hard to find. And most important, after running the humidifier overnight, and with my daughter's door partly open, water pools up all around the humidifier and soaks her carpet about 5-6 ft from where the humidifier sits on her dresser. I now have to cover her dresser with a vinyl tablecloth and cover most of her floor with towels to prevent further damage. I'm now shopping for a new model and recommend you keep shopping too (unless you're prepared to mop the floors after each use and don't mind damaging your floors and furniture)."
3,cool mist humidifier,"I received the humidifier as a shower gift and it's OK. I do agree with the review that talked about the white dust. I have no idea what it is, but it forms on my TV and furniture."
3,Definitely humidifies the air...,"...but also gets the floor damp around it. (And we have a large piece of cardboard and a bath towel under it.) Haven't tried any other humidifies so I can't make a fair comparison, but I'm not thrilled with the amount of water it spits out. Not sure if I would buy this again."
1,Terrible product,I wish I had seen the reviews for this product before I bought it. It leaks water when you use it. I would NOT recommend this to anyone.
1,Don't buy this,This product is horrible! It is noisy and worst of all it produces a horrible musty smell!
2,After a couple of months ... throwing it out!,"We used this periodically with our 4 month old. We didn't need it till about about two months ago, and didn't have any problems till last week. We finally had to throw it out. It began leaking, soaking the towel we had to put under it and then the carpet."
3,humid,"I recieved this as a baby shower gift. I used it when our baby was 1 month old but it just splashes water out. Now that my daughter is 3 months, I am going to give it another chance if it continues I will be throwing it out. I agree it doesn't make much noise."
2,Niagra Falls Nursery,I bought this shortly after my daughter was born when she had her first cold last winter. After the first use the nursery was entirely covered with a white film that was impossible to get rid of. The humidifier also shot out water similar to a fountain. Everything in the nursery was completely soaked including the carpet. My daughter was then sick with her second cold and once again I had the same experience with this humidifier. I do not recommend this model by any means unless you have a baby pool to stick it in. It is horrible. I recently went out and purchased the Vicks Cool Mist Model V3500 Humidifier which had great reviews. I'm hoping that humidifier won't turn my daughter's room into Niagra Falls.
1,Don't Buy This...,"I got this humidifier and thinking VICKS would be a good brand. However when I used it it SOAKED EVERYTHING!!! I filled it to the line it says and I even put a towel under it when it was running! The towel was soaked (you could ring water out of it) the rug was wet, the wall was dripping with water!! Then after a few weeks use it started to SMELL!!!! I washed it out and even looked in the store for filters and couldn't find ANY! I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE!!!"
1,White Dust,"I am very unhappy with the the Vicks Cool Mist Humidifier. We have white dust all over the nursery and it is very difficult to get out. Our son was sick and we wanted to use the humidifier to help him breath, but instead he ended up breathing the white dust. We used distilled bottled water so I dont undertand how this could occur. I would definetly not recommend this. Our pediatrician has even told us not to use it anymore. I rate this very poorly"
2,????White Dust,I too have a white film all over my daughter's room and a huge puddle under the humidifier. It is hard for me to believe that it is becuase there is to much moisture in the air. If the air is to moist then my review of this product is unfair. At this point I am alsmost willing to go spend the money on a second humidifier just to find out. It is loud but soothing and I buy filters on line pretty cheap. The white dust is a pain and I have city water so it does not have anything to do with the type of water you fill it with.
4,A good humidifier,"I love this humidifier. It doesn't leak for me, but then again I put it on a stool with a small towel, just incase I get water on the bottom of the unit when I fill it. It is louder than I would have expected and the filter just makes it worse. I took the filter out and it's quiter now. Besides the fact that it's hard to find the filters. But all in all, it puts water vapour back into my air and it does a good job doing it."
1,the worse humidifier ever,i bought this humidifier for my baby and it sucks... its loud bery hard to clean and you end up with water all around it...do not buy it
2,Filters...? Anyone...?,"I haven't had any problems with the noise that this humidifier makes and the only time that I had wet carpet was when the machine was on the floor. However, I have looked EVERYWHERE for the so called ""replaceable"" filter cartridges! They are non-existant! As far as I'm concerned, the humidifier works fine, but if you cannot find the accessories...why bother."
1,Disappointed,"My family has used this humidifier for years, buying new replacements periodically. The latest versions are not working well now. Even after working through customer service to get new ones sent to us and our sending back the ones that didn't work well, this machine just doesn't perform anymore. That is sad. We liked it best of all the many choices out there. We are in search of a good alternative. But, the delivery was as expected and it was packaged well."
3,Schematic,"This is a very broad overview of state formation across a very broad stretch of European history. The term schematic literally characterizes this book as Tilly presents a good deal of his analysis in the form of simple diagrams. This also illustrates the major defect of this book; the analysis, while undoubtedly correct, is essentially obvious. Tilly's conclusions boil down to 3 points; Europe evolved to a system of complex national states from a hodgepodge of weak states, this Darwinian process was driven by military competition and warfare, and the specific evolution of individual states was varied and driven by specific historical circumstances. None of this will be a surprise to virtually anyone with a modest knowledge of European history."
5,He set her inhibitions free! Great Story!,"Despite the dangers Sabrina Spencer was determined to go to New Mexico and find her fathers's killer. To protect herself from unwanted advances she donned a gray wig and veiled hat and swaddled herself in a padded gown before blackmailing rugged Ridge Tanner into guiding her to Ft Canby. But the costume soon became her prison-for the passionate beauty had fallen head over heels for her verile companion. Ridge Tanner knew something was amiss. So when the mysterious woman fell asleep one night he took a good look at the baggage he was escorting West. Right then and there, Ridge vowed that before they reached Santa Fe, he'd strip away her unsightly disguise and make her surrender to her heart's beloved betrayal."
3,"Wonderful dialogue, great characters, but.......","It distresses me to rate this a 3, because the dialogue is funny and amusing and fresh. The characters........you've got to love the hunky hero and fiesty Sabrina-samantha-scarlet....The Only problem I had with this book is that it was too wordy. Pages of thinking...often the same stuff...her distrust of men and skepticism of love. It is obvious early on that these are a pair made for each other. The book just didn't need 400 pages or so to get the job done......Glad I read it, but won't keep it."
3,Really potent,"I bought this as a gift to myself from my husband because it has become the sent I like. However, this particular bottle was very strong and I don't know if it is what you would get in the stores. Maybe it was old or just made a little different that the last bottle of this that I had, but I don't know if I will buy this online again. Perfume is better to be bought in the store so you know what you are getting."
5,Superb material for thought-provoking growth,"This book proved to be well worth the money. Rather than the usual ""self esteem"" spin, it is an honest, insightful work that inspired me to re-read it again and again, learning a bit more each time. The end of chapter questions are helpful and thought provoking. I found it, overall, to be a very useful tool in breaking some attrocious habits I've carried most of my adult life and taking charge of my life's direction."
5,BEST LOCAL CD IN A LONG TIME,"This CD is so beautifully arranged with thier own unique style! I've had it since it came out and listen to it over and over, still no where near being played out. The sounds are sooo soothing and makes you feel good anytime of the day. Just what ""feel good hawaiian music"" is all about. Every song on this CD will have you singing. With songs like ""Don't have to think twice and ""Island woman"", close your eyes and let the music take you strait back home! This CD drives me absolutely Pupule. Definately the best CD I have. A hui hou, from Seattle!"
4,soothing and mellow,"great for yoga, soothing and relaxing. Mellow. Doesn't contain the annoying sounds that many Yoga CDs have. Would recommend this"
3,"Misleading title, not truly a ""class""","This is an audio CD with music only, there is no voice-over with a guided routine, which is what I thought I was getting when I purchased this CD. Don't be mislead!! What is included, however, is a mini-poster of a routine that is suggested to go along with this collection of songs. I ended up doing my own routine, which was fine, but sometimes when you are doing yoga, you don't want to have to think about what to do next, it's nice to be ""told"" versus worrying about whether or not you did the same sequence of poses on the other side. (Yogi's, you know what I mean!) The music selection is average, very tribal in nature. The very last track is potentially distracting, unfortunate since you should be in sivasana at the end. Overall, average, I would recommend Yoga Rhythm By Soulfood instead."
2,"Not bad, but not exactly my thing....","Some good tracks on this CD, and probably quite nice overall if you teach a very spiritually-oriented class. Admittedly, I bought this CD out of curiosity and don't mind listening to most of it on a casual basis. It's about as good as the classic Asana CD, overall.The reason I don't use it in class is very simple. The vocal and lyric of the final cut is obnoxiously repetitive and terribly self-important. Not exactly what I what when I'm setting the mood for Savasana (final resting pose)."
5,"A ""mad and Bad"" Dad","Passion Flower and her little sister Afterthought are joyed to spend the hols with their father.At first.He lets them do what they like at any time.But soon life becomes pretty scary, as their father is running from someone and he won't let them call their mother.He even keeps them locked in a small room for days with a bucket as a toilet.It is when he tries to leave the country with them that they finally rebel against him.As usual, Jean Ure writes about serious subjects in a way that is extrememly interesting to children.And to others."
2,Dead Battery,I had to buy a battery since the watch was totally dead when it arrived. And good luck in reading the manual...
1,POOR QUALITY,The pump we received has been back for repairs 2 times in the 1st 3 weeks ( it is still out for repair at the time of this post). I am very suprised and disappointed at the lack of quality this pump exhibits.
4,Charming and heartfelt,"THe best overall word for this one is: Sweet. While there is some cynicism and bitterness to the characters, the overall effect is one of emotional honesty charged ith nervous humor. The performances are great in this one. Clarkson, of course, but also Holmes and Platt are particularly moving. This borders on the sentimental, but doesn't go cross the line. I dare you not to be moved by this one."
5,Great Thanksgiving Movie,"This movie has become a staple in my house for our Thanksgiving traditions. Keep an open mind while starting it. It's low-budget and kind of artsy, but it's a wonderful story and perfect for the holidays."
4,Great Thanksgiving movie,"Katie Holmes is great in this! Everyone plays an important part to add to the ""funk"". This is a very raw account of a first thanksgiving. Bittersweet, but highly reccommended."
4,another good indie,"I really did not want to see this movie or was really looking forward to watching a movie about a ""bad apple"" of a family. I was pleasantly surprised though with Pieces of April. The movie is about a family visiting there daughter in New York for Thanksgiving. The mom, Patricia Clarkson (who should win the Oscar, but won't), is dying of breast cancer and this will most likely be her last Thanksgiving. April, Katie Holmes, has neighbors help her when oven doesn't work and meets a variety of people, which often leads to funny situations. April and her family do not really talk because, as stated earlier, she is the odd child.This movie had its really funny parts but it is a movie that will make you cry at the end. If you do not like independent films, you probably won't want to waste your time because this is a slower paced movie that does not have any special effects or action scenes, like most big budgeted movies. If you're an indie watcher, this is your cup of tea."
5,Very Impressed!,"We just watched this movie and we were thoroughly impressed. Not surprised at all that Patricia Clarkson was nominated for an Oscar for it. It was really compelling, very well acted, but still had a great deal of humor to it as well. Big thumbs up."
5,I loved this movie!!!!!,"The title says it all! Katie Holmes is excellent in this 'small' film of about the redeeming aspects of human nature. The film is honest without being heavy handed; Funny without being too glib. Serious without forcing you to yawn. In other words, this is a great, not good, but a great film. Oliver Platt is flawless as the dad. Patricia Clarkson is awesome as April's mother. No one is a caricature. They are all people we've known, family as truth. The director deserved an Academy Award nomination. Enough with the Lord of the Rings-type movies. Let's spread the wealth, ladies and gentlemen."
4,"To die for, literally","A terrific little indie film focusing on April, played by Katie Holmes of Wonder Boys. She's the black sheep of her suburban family, and she's living in a really ratty walk-up apartment in NYC with her latest boyfriend. Her mom, wonderfully and poignantly played by Patricia Clarkson in a role that allows her to portray a whole palette of human emotions from hope to rage, is struggling with a poor cancer prognosis. April has never gotten along with anyone in her family, except perhaps her dad - a sweet guy who tries hard to keep all the pieces together in an epic car ride to NY. They're headed into the City, where April, who can't cook toast, has taken on the job of fixing Thanksgiving dinner, as a gesture of healing for the family.Needless to say, fiasco follows fiasco - and it's funny and outrageous and heartbreaking.Wonderful emotional conclusion that steers wide of being sappy."
1,disappointed Thanksgiving movie...,"I was looking for a new movie to watch for Thanksgiving. I love comedies and since this movie is located under comedies and had such great reviews, I bought it. I was so disappointed with the movie. First of all, it should be under drama, not comedy. There was not one funny scene in the whole movie. It was boring in some scenes, too many close ups of the goth look of April and the movie was all around horrible. I just wanted to clear up that this movie is not a comedy, if there are any movie lovers out there, like me, that love comedies."
4,some wonderful actors in this low budget film,"Katie Holmes, in particular, as well as Derek Luke, OliverPlatt, etc. I liked the writing a lot, direction--as well as the camera work. Hard to believe it was shot with a 3 chip Sony digital camera!Ordinarily this would not have been my type of flick, etc., but wanted to see what they were able to accomplish with the Sony PD 150... Like I said: fine work--and you can't help but like and appreciate a talented actress like Ms. Holmes (who pretty much carries most of the film)."
5,GREAT movie!!,"Pieces of April is a great film. Its a small independent film with a very big meaning. The script and cast are excellent, Katie Holmes shines as April...by far her best movie yet. Patricia Clarkson is great as well, powerful performance from her as well as the rest of the cast. Peter Hedges did wonderful job with the script and directing Pieces of April. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I would definately recommend it!"
4,"A simple, but moving, indie flick","IF Katie holmes wouldn't have removed herself from the hollywood realm we would have been without somebodies favorite movie. I know once you see this it'll be one of your favorite movies in recent years. The story is simple, and that's what's good about it; alot of us can relate to it. IT's not too complex, but alot of texture lies beneath the crust making it not too simple. The acting is superb; Katie holmes is top notch, and shines off whatever actors she's in the room with. ANd even though it's a ""holiday"" movie it can be watched at any time. the dysfunctional family, the hateful sister, the mistrusting mom, and the dad who hopes it all turns out ok, make for a superb movie that will keep you enamored."
