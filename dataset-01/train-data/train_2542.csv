5,Shaves like new again!,I absolutley love my linear ES8092! I use my shaver to shave my face as well as my head so I am very hard on the blades. I decided after a year of use it was time to get new blades and WOW! The shaver performs like new again!
1,Amazon entice you to buy,"It is a great disappointment with Amazon when it pushed to sell a product, WES9006PC replacement inner blade and outer foil combination for pro curve linear shavers without indicating that they are not compatible with the Panasonic ES8162S Pro Curve Elite Convex Wet/Dry shaver I purchased. Amazon displaced those two products next to each other as though if I made a purchase those products together I would save money. Now I was forced to buy one more shaver that would be compatible with WES9006PC replacement."
4,good replacement,"Makes my electric razor perform almost as good as did originally when itwas new.Suggest annual replacement or whenever it drags, even after cleaning.,"
4,Excellent,"The comb and shaving blades do the job they were manufactured to do. They give me a close shave without irritation. I have had this shaver for a few years and this is third time I've replaced these items. This is the best electric shaver I have owned. It's more expensive than many others but, as the saying goes, ""you get what you pay for""."
1,Inaccurate readings,"I was really excited when I got this scale because I had noticed that my weight tends to fluctuate with the gym scale. Well, this one does too. The first day it gave me a reading of 150 lbs, 2 minutes later a reading of 153 lbs. My body fat percentage fluctuates too, up to 3 % points. This scale is a piece of crap and because I threw out the box that came with it I'm now stuck with it."
4,Scale Review,I placed a free weight on my scale. Accuracy of scale slightly off by .4 oz. It's better than most scales.
5,Very Nice Scale,"This is only my second ever digital body fat monitor scale that I've owned.My first scale (Taylor) would give me a range of sometime 5 lbs within a minute (very frustrating) and it had an annoyingly loud beep when I used the body fat monitor function.This Tanita is a huge improvement in those two categories.I think the most that my weight has fluctuated within a minute's time was maybe half a pound, but usually 2/10th of a lb. (I've got in the habit of measuring myself at least 3 times in a row)This scale is also much quieter. I measure my weight and body fat in the morning and my wife is still asleep. This also beeps indicating when to step on and another when it displays your body fat %, but it is not annoying at all (like the Taylor).It's twice what I paid for the Taylor, but it's 10 times better.Very Pleased with this purchase."
4,Everything I expected,"The Tanita scale does everything its supposed to and is very easy to operate. Once you set up your information it is easy to track your weigh-in history, which helps you stay on track. The only thing you have to remember is to step on the scale barefoot if you want to get your fat and water percentage readings.Tanita BF679W Duo Scale Plus Body Fat Monitor with Body Water"
2,Apparently I'm nearing obesity,"I bought this product because I am girl who lifts weights regularly so I am more concerned with losing body fat than overall weight. I am 24 years old, 5'4, and I lift about twice a week. Since buying the scale 2 months ago my body fat has gone up consistently everyday according to the scale. At this point it says I am 123lbs at 30% body fat. I think that even while taking muscle into account, 123lbs is in no way overweight for my height and age. Yet every BMI calculator I have found says that 30% is nearing obesity for my age and height. I tried resetting the whole program and still got the same results! The weight seems to be accurate, I just wouldn't trust the other information. Save yourself the money and buy a regular scale!"
1,It died prematurely,My Tanita died prematurely and the company said it was excess humidity. The scale was in the bathroom as most scales are. I'm very disappointed that Tanita didn't design their scale to work in an environment in which most scales are placed.I replaced it with another brand.I will never buy Tanita again.
4,"Accurate, Yet Confusing","The weight is accurate but the body fat % and water % seem less so. I'm not sure what the function of knowing your water % is...except to know if you're dehydrated? Even then, do we not have an 'built-in' alarm function, called thirst? If this is important to know for you, then you might want to pay extra for this feature. If not, then just buy the cheaper version with the weight measurement."
4,Bathroom Scale,Easy to set up. Easy to read. Attractive design. Features body fat % and water content monitors in addition to weight.
3,No Back-light & Small Numbers,I usually weight myself in the morning before going into the shower. I also wear glasses and don't take them into the bathroom with me when I am going to take a shower. I found the scale difficult to read without my glasses.
1,a piece of junk,"I own a Tanita scales. It worked great until the original batteries ran out. A call to the company gave me the information that any AA batteries would work. That is an out right lie. I spent $ 24.00 on a variety of batteries from regular AA to Lithium AA and NONE works on the scales. Hence, I am buying a new scales now. It is simply too expensive to replace the scales every time the batteries run out."
4,"great scale, interesting to use","good scale, not intuitive to use, defiently have to read the instructions. works great, compared to another scale at work and it was the same"
4,consistent measurements,the weight measurements are always consistent. very little variability between multiple weighings. i have even used it to determine the weight of packages before going to the post office. it is always the same weight (to the ounce) that the post office gets too.the fat and water percent determinations i am not sure about. i have no secondary source for confirmation.i like the personalized settings. the buttons are easy to operate with your toes too!
3,"Eh, so so scale","I bought this with high hopes but I am really not sold on it. Weight wise, it does very well. Body Fat and Total Body Water I am not sold on. The fluctuations are very broad and to tell you the truth, it just doesn't seem to be accurate in that department. The total water never changes no matter how I try to drown myself in water in the days before a weigh in and the body fat changes every time I step on it. Following the instructions, this unit does not do accurately what it was designed to do. For the price though, it's not a bad scale overall."
3,Scale good body fat odd,"Just got this, used yesterday body fat percentage was 21% used today and my body fat was 12%. While yesterday's workout was hard that would be an impressive change in body composition in a 24 hour period.Scale was consistent."
5,Good product.,Great product for the money. Love being able to see my body fat percentage go up/down. Easy to use.
2,Tanita BF679W Bathroom Scales,"I wish it had a light behind the numbers, hard to read. Only have been using the bathroom scales a week, not sure about the readings (body fat and body water), they change a few pounds/numbers each day."
2,a very average scale...not worth the price,"I got this scale because I figured Tanita had a pretty good reputation for quality - not this one. This scale feels so cheap (lightweight) and you get anywhere from 1-3 different readings each time you step on it - which is my #1 issue with it. It also has a button on the side where you can just weigh yourself like a regular scale (vs programming your information in) and you have to push it so far in that you can do it with your toe alone, you have to lean down and push. Then when you get off, and want to weigh again (which I do because it's always different!), the counter quickly goes to zero and you have to hop back on within 3 seconds, or it shuts off. I would never buy this scale again or recommend to anyone - very expensive for no more quality than a cheap $5 scale at Walmart."
5,Perfect Scale,This scale is as advertised. It's very accurate. We love this scale. Worth every penny.
2,If you have muscles consider a different scale,"If you have any muscle at all, get another scale. This scale assumes you have the physique of a water balloon (only filled with blubber), the muscle mass of rubber bands and the skeletal structure of tooth picks; like you've already made the evolutionary leap to the futuristic humans as they appear in the movie, Wall-E. After plugging my data into the scales, I was shocked to be told my % body fat was 10 % points higher than other scales I have used (usually 28%) in the past. When the same height and age entered but a theoretical male gender used instead of female, the % body fat dropped to 25% (dropped 14% points). Not pleased."
2,Very Inconsistent,This Tanita scale was very inconsistent and I returned in less than one week. I was very surprised it was so hard to get accurate readings and from day to day. It would fluctuate a much larger margin than it should. I would weigh +/- 9 lbs from day to day and fluctuate almost the same in the body fat %. I would not recommend purchasing this device.
4,Works exactly as described....,"Added this device after I installed the base item - the transmitter and receiver that comes with the initial kit. I first wanted a remote for my doorbell where I work near the computer where I could not hear the doorbell. Once I had installed the base system, I installed this second receiver in the garage. Simply plugged it in and it worked...what else can you ask for!"
4,Door Chime Receiver,This product is great if you need a receiver. We put one in the basement and one upstairs so we can hear the doorbell. So far the range is perfect for our needs.
3,Ultimit Slow Shipper,"I was not happy with this seller. The shipping was just to slow with no real way to track the item. I do a good amount of buying on the internet and know the hows and wear fors. Also this seller did not keep thair word, with a request for me to revise my review. I did what thay asked however, thay did not do what thay had promissed!!. Thus I have revised my review one more for the last time. Buyer bewere!!!"
4,Beware of the Ultimate Blender - no support,"I like the Ultimate Chopper. However, because of a lack of support I cannot recommend the Ultimate Blender. My rubber washer was damaged and when I called the company to get a new washer - they told me they didn't have it or sell it."
1,Ultimate junk,"The ultimate chopper blender just adds insult to injury since theultimate chopper is a piece of junk to begin with. It drips, doesn't work properly and customer service is a total joke."
1,Save your money,"It finally died with a shower of spark out of the base and would not start. I must have blew out the internal fuse! I only had it for 4 months! The blender was ok but was too small with the small blender container. The base started to leak. It was noisy. Tried to make a smoothie with the chopper attachment, failed because of bad design, it leaked all over place. Check out a vita mix or the ninja blender."
4,Love the chopper,"I have had the chopper from when it first came out but had to stop using the blender because the blender base stripped on the post underneath the blender base.I decided after all this time, to try again to find a replacement and I am so surprised the chopper was shown as no longer available and customers have had so MUCH trouble. So far mine has been okay although I do not use the chopper a lot compared to the blender.I use to make a lot of smoothies and I assume now, from reviews, it was the ice that it would NOT chop, that caused the strip-out of underneath the base. I cannot get the blender unscrewed from the base which is a pain in the $&%*. Which make me have to order the whole itemAfter so many bad reviews I am reluctant to order the blender I see for sale but I may give it a try and hope I will not be sorry. The rest of the chopper is fine and I do need the blender. Wish me luck."
1,It Shrinks!,"I am very disappointed with this product. After a couple of times in the wash, it shrunk terribly. It was so hard to get on and while trying, both sets of sheets ripped!"
1,Only used once!!!,I purchased this sheet in sage before our baby was born. I washed them along with everything else prior to baby using it. They shrunk so bad that I ripped the sheet when I tried to put it on the mattress. There is NO streching them at all..I will never buy these again.
1,It was strunk after first wash,"Fortunately, I only opened one of the 4 I bought. I washed it and found it was shrunk, and I had a hard time to put it onto the mattress. The other reviewers are right, the sheets are very thin and not soft. I also bought a carter's mattress sheet which is much thicker and softer, and it still fits pretty well after I washed it."
3,Dermalogica Super Rich Repair,I ordered one jar and was given another jar for Christmas. I don't know which one I opened but suffice it to say that it was an old jar. The jar configuration was of the old type compared to the new one I last used. The oil in the jar was also separated from the cream somewhat and it had a slightly rancid smell when applied to the face. It is obvious to me that whoever shipped it had it in stock for quite sometime before releasing it for sale. I was not happy with the product that I received. Usually I have been very happy with the product in the past.
2,very rich,Had gottn a sample of this-it felt WONDERFUL&I nevr experiencd moisture like that. Got it home&made me break out mayb cuz its hot weathr. Will try it again in winter.
3,Repackaged Orinoco,"Not too bad if you d/l the most recent software. This is a rebranded Orinoco Silver Card (also in AP). Biggest problem is that Sony customer support is clueless about the product. he manual has -0-ref to XP, but it works. Nice feature is that you can easily add external antennas to both ends. All these wireless products have poor performance unless you're in the same room."
2,Car Charger for iPod Shuffle,"This device charges the shuffle while you are playing it (a feature that I believe exists only for the older rectangular shuffle). However, the charger emits a static noise that makes listening unpleasant. (My husband opened it up and wired in a capacitor that got rid of the noise. Somebody ought to tell the manufacturer to do this.) Thus, I only can recommend this product to those who will charge the shuffle while driving and unplug it when listening."
3,uniform,"Very good for the price.I would call it a lightweight uniform, not middleweight.The size is right on. I ordered it a little big as my other brand uniform shrunk so bad, but even washing this in hot and drying it did not shrink it as much as I wanted so it holds up to washings well.You can't ask for much more for the price. Good deal."
3,"Not funny, poor selection","The subtitle reads: ""Over 2,000 vicious, barbed, and completely funny quips and quotes by and about the famous and infamous."" I looked through the whole book for something really good and, to be honest, I didn't find a whole lot. Sure, there were those that were somewhat witty, but overall it was a disappointment.I'm giving it 3 stars because it was well-organized and -indexed, but if you're looking for some great insults this isn't the right book."
3,Professional? Maybe - Useful? Definitely,"If you are new to MTS and MSMQ (which a good number of organizations are), this is a great place to start. Even after a year and a half of MTS/MSMQ programming, I still refer to this book every once in a while for helpful tips and hints. Unfortunately, though, I don't consider it a professional level book. Amidst all of the code samples and screen shots, real technical information is missing. So, if you're looking to get into MTS and MSMQ programming, this book can get you on the right track, but if you're an experienced developer make sure you obtain other resources."
2,"Lacking in depth, poorly edited","In addition to the extremely poor editing that seems to be common to many WROX books, I find that this book lacks information in many basic areas in MTS and MSMQ, for example there is not a single entry in the index regarding the shared property manager. Most other books I have seen that even survey MTS at least mention the SPM. It also has no information regarding regarding performance issues (that I can find, there is no entry in the index).Some chapters are OK, but overall the depth is lacking.I would consider this a fair introduction, but ""professional"" it is not. I would give it a better review if it was called ""Beginning""."
1,A Bogus Book to learn the concepts of MTS!!,"The Book's title of being PROFESSIONAL is a misnomer. The book only teaches how to implement a very simple car selling program. It convieniently misses the details involved in transaction level programming.When I bought a book on ""professional"" MTS programmming I expected some tips on writing better faster and more complicated applications. I learnt more of VB than MTS from this book.Professionals can read "" 50 ways to improve your COM and MTS applications"""
2,I don't understand how it can possibly get a 4 stars,"For every topic, it just outline the subject without going to the detail. You can't possibly get anything out of this book."
2,A book not worth purchasing,"I'm generally very happy with WROX books, but this one fails in a number of categories if you are looking for detailed information about MSMQ.There is very little discussion about MSMQ from a network perspective. It doesn't address how to setup MSMQ in an enterprise environment -- PECs vs. BSC vs. IC, etc. There are lots of code samples, but most of them focus on the non-MSMQ DNA aspects of distributed programming. The example architecture is also simplistic to the point of not being usable in a real environment. A client-VB app running as the interactive user on a destination machine is less than desirable.The authors also missed a number of details -- the error handling isn't even right. In VB, code is not executed past an Err.Raise call.A dissapointing book from an otherwise impressive publisher."
3,An intro to MTS and MSMQ at the most,"This book gives you an idea why you would want to use MTS and MSMQ, and how to use it. However, it doesn't discuss the intricacies of managing and designing MTS and MSMQ servers. It's a good intro, but definitely not your last book on MTS and MSMQ."
1,DO NOT BUY!,I am dedicated to WROS press (except for this book)!!! This book was a BIG binding of fluff. Try Robert Jennings' Database Workshop: Microsoft Transaction Server.
4,Much better than average,"The MTS examples/explanations are solid and don't cut corners. MSMQ probably needs a 1K page book in its own right, but this serves as a good introduction."
5,Good Explanation for the concepts behind MTS and MSMQ,"If you are looking of a concise summary of MTS and MSMQ, this the one book you should read especially since the authors cover ground not covered in the manuals."
5,Father Coughlin and the Catholic Church,"This book about the activities of Father Coughlin in the 1920's and 1930's should be read by every American, especially every Roman Catholic American, to learn from his anti-semitism, his support of Adolph Hitler, his use of his position in this church, and his use Church funds, to do this by his widespread radio programs to millions of Americans, and the little the Church leaders did to stop him so that all Americans know the truth of his history and the Church's history."
2,Item is not as repesented !!!!,When I received the CD it was not as shown in ad and had different songs. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT !!!!! Would send item back but not worth time or effort. Item description needs to be changed in the ad.
4,BEST ACTION SPORTS GAME OF THE YEAR!,"This game shows the real meaning of Wakeboarding. The graphics are unbelievable and it is so fun, you will want to play it 24-7.You can choose your favorite wakeboarder and try to accomplish the game's goal. Even if you don't really know much about wakeboarding, It is definetely worth your money!"
2,Looks can be deceiving,"What a piece of junk! This is for show only. I'm pretty sure this would break even under occasional use. Lights and sounds only happen when the Dalek is moving, You can't turn them on remotely or on the toy. You can't control the head or turret movement. Control is for moving the Dalek around only. I've bought remote control vehicles with far superior quality at a quarter of this price."
5,Fit for a Canon A95,"Fits my Canon A95 just about perfectly. You would need a custom case to get a better fit. Case is extremely well constructed. It does add a little bit of ""bulk"" to the camera, but not an excessive amount. The A95 is already a little big to fit in ones shirt pocket, so it doesn't really matter."
2,leaked,not sure I would purchase laundry soap through the mail again the bottles I got had leaked all over the box it was messy and I lost about 1/4 of the soap
2,Very small,This was much smaller and flimsier than I was expecting. It is more of a two-bite cookie cutter. I wouldn't recommend.
1,Un-Manly tool box.,"Desc. on website is ""Heavy-Duty"", and ""Rigid Construction"". The item received was of very thin gage construction and visibly flexes when pressed down on with finger.Cheap latches incorrectly located.What was not in the item's description is that this item is Made in China. Kein used to make good quality tools, but now they produce in Mexico and China, and their quality has suffered.I assume based on the other review on Amazon, calling this a ""Manly box"" (what ever that is) that the reviewer must have received a ""Made in USA"" rather than the ""Made in China"" box that I received."
2,very basic,"I must say that the more books aimed at pagan parenting the better, but this book is definately geered more toward the parent who is new to paganism and parenting. It has many cute ideas and activities to do with kids. If you are a seasoned parent or pagan, this book will simply be old news."
1,Not compatible with newer laptops,"The sensor looks nice but the software is mediocre and does not install properly which renders the sensor useless. After spending 2 hours with technical support over several calls, I understood that he software was programmed in japan, that it is not up to date, and that the US technicians do not have access to its inner functionning. Downloaded latest driver: still not working. Internet support is very weak ; their knowledge base does not have a single entry! Overall the support staff was nice but was not helpfull at all. I had to send the unit back and pay 15% restocking fee."
1,DID NOT LAST,Flew the toy one time crashed and that was the end of it. To fix it with the part i needed would have cost $39.00 . Dont waste your money on this toy .
5,If you liked L.A Confidential,"When I read Michael Malone's first mystery ""Uncivil Seasons,"" I was most impressed with policeman Cuddy Mangum. His dialogue seemed the most authentic, his character the most fully realized. What a pleasure then to have an entire book told in his voice. And what a book! This is a big, gorgeous, complicated piece of work. Malone weaves so many characters and plotlines and issues together -- and seamlessly, at that -- that it's truly breathtaking. As for the writing itself, there's not one clunky sentence, not one line of false dialogue, not one overblown metaphor. It's all clean, crisp and very, very funny. In short, this is not only one of the finest mysteries I've ever read, it's simply one of the finest NOVELS I've ever read."
4,well worth the read but preferred uncivil seasons,"Mr. Malone blends a strong courtroom police procedural plot with interesting characters and a feel for the current small town south. His plots [also in Handling Sin and Uncivil Seasons] are extremely intricate and the main characters, especially Cuddy and Justin, so clearly drawn that you feel they are people you have actually met and care about. My only critcisms are that the plot is a bit too intricate --there are so many threads running in and out of the story that it is difficult to keep them all together --I'd say the same is true for the number of minor characters who appear. All in all --he has quickly become one of my favorite writers and his books grab my interest and are completely enjoyable."
2,An Uneven Idiosyncratic Novel,"This writer - and his readers - enjoy switching their attention just as MTV cuts its videos. It's as if the author said, ""Look at this!"" - and before your eyes had focused on what he pointed out, he was again saying, ""And look at this!"" He does this over and over and over. It is wearing, enervating, and annoying. I prefer something that the author has at least predigested for me, with a point of view, and with a main character that I like and can identify with. If you like a fast carnival ride that bangs you about and leaves you bruised, you will like this book. Otherwise, read something else."
1,Think twice before buying!,"Think twice before investing you hard earned Dollars for this DVD. Neils' performance is excellent! The video quality is dated! The producer seems to like low shots of the performer with bright spots in the background, which washes out the picture for a time (to me its annoyng) The really bad part of this disc is the sound quality. It ranges from good to downright awful. At times his vocals are great, then for whatever reason there is an annoying echo to his voice. Thruout most of the program the Synthesizer sounds like it was recorded at 33 1/2 rpm, and played back at 20rpm (very sour sound)The mixing is definately lacking. I am a rabid Neil Diamond fan, and I was able to listen to abour three fourths of this before giving up. I feel this is one program that should have been left buried in the Vaults."
2,Neal Diamond TY Australia Concert,"The VIDEO was delivered quickly and wrapping material was clean and fresh at a very attractive price. There was no problem or issue with the vendor and considered them excellent or 5-Star. The product is rated 2-Star. The earlier negative reviews were considered before purchase accurate. The songs and the singing by Neal Diamond (ND) were ok to disappointing only. There was too much commentary between songs and the video was only OK but distracting. The picture was too many times dark and distracting from the music. The sound quality was minimal at best.The songs on the video did not include many of my favorites, especially the song ""America."" In researching the product, I could not find a listing of the song list prior to purchase, at the time I loved all of ND's songs and still do.I do not replay the video to hear the songs again, apathy, a small disappointment."
3,Diamond in a coal mine,"Rather disappointed with this lackluster performance. He just never seemed to get out of first gear and entertain the crowd. It just stayed at one level throughout the show, like the Pope at an outdoor mass. I think he was aiming at impersonating Elvis without the hip movement.I enjoyed Neil more at his recent concert where he did not appear to take himself so seriously. Maybe he had the advantage of time to look at his great body of work and present it in a more entertaining manner."
5,The Best Neil Diamond DVD ever!,"This is the best Neil Diamond DVD to come out. Other Neil Diamond Dvds are either chopped up Tv specials or 60 min made for TV affairs. Not so with ""Thank you Ausrailla"" concert in March 1976. Recorded before a large crowd of 38000 people(a record at the time)You get the complete 2 hour concert plus bonus features.Most experts agree that it's better to film a concert rather than videotaping it. However, It appears that the tapes have been preserved and taken care of. The quality of the picture and sound are very good.There is a bonus track of ""Morningside"", which has been restored. During the origanal broadcast, it was cut short by a comerical break. I wish they would have edited this song into the concert. This is only a minor thing-no big deal.If you are a diamond fan, you will want this DVD. Buy it. You won't find a more complete Neil Diamond concert on DVD than this!"
2,Not really a TRUE S/W,"Being an old S/W hobbiest, I was pretty disappointed with this Grundig..better for local AM & FM stations..can't really complain about the price..you get what you pay for.."
3,inaccurate and too small SW dials,"The good news is that this uses AA batteries, none of those AAA batteries that have almost the same linear dimensions, but not nearly the same volume, and consequently don't play nearly as long as the AA batteries. The Mini World 100 PE is very small. You always have room in a pocket or book case. You now can take a radio absolutely anywhere. It clips to your belt with no inconvenience. The FM stereo sound through headphones is superb. I recommend this nifty receiver when you want to listen to local AM or FM. Finding a SW station on the puny, inaccurate frequency scales is excruciatingly difficult. This receiver may pull in the station you're looking for, but you's need Great Caesar's Ghost to help you find it on the dial. My real need was for hearing the National Public Radio network's All Things Considered programs. This radio will go with me anywhere for that, but I kissed off the possibility of ENJOYING finding favorite SW stations."
5,is very llitle but very ecletic,me parece un milagro de la electronica muy pequeno y realiza tareas extraordinarias de sintonizar cualquier radio de todos los paises es muy bonito y funcional perfecto para el aficionado de ondas cortas
1,low grade quality,"I supposed location is everything. Up here in Alaska, I found this radio to be rather limiting if not almost useless. Reception proves to be very weak, tuning isn't the most exact science here and quality of this radio wasn't very high. I brought this radio from REI and within a year, the speaker cover fell off (they were just glued in) and my tuner dial fell apart. Needless to say, this wasn't Grundig's finest effort.I did get good AM/PM reception within the city limits but I can do that with almost any radio. SW modes were limited, even on a clear nights, on top of a mountain. Its a weak radio, probably good in a very civilized part of the world but worthless out where you really need it. Small size is nice but why carry a radio around if you can't pick up anything once the city lights are no longer in sight??"
1,"Should be labeled ""Not so New Light on Chaco Canyon""",When this book was published in 1984 it may indeed have been new information but much has been discovered since then. ...
2,Boring,"I played this game when I was 15 because I was afraid of it as a child. The creepy music and the dinosaur being eaten and some guy dying.. yeah. I used to hide in the backyard when dad played it.But when I played this for myself, seeing it for the first time since year 5... I realised how stupid this game is. This is a pretty old game. You probably shouldn't buy it because it's hopelessly repetitive and easy and the graphics are also quite boring and unrealistic. If you do buy it, take note it's strictly a puzzle game and there isn't any hint of action in it. Takes only a few hours to complete."
1,Don't buy this if you are going to France,...We bought the Flash French because we are going to Francethis summer...it makes reference to a book that doesn'tcome with the tape and you can't buy. It doesn't teach common phrases and doesn't allow proper practice with the narrator. Don't waste your money on this one.END
4,really good pans!,Items are well made and very easy to clean but you have to remember that they are not dishwasher safe. This leaves them sitting on the counter sometimes until time allows hand washing.
4,Great for the new family,My son and his fiancee had this set of cookware on their wish list. We bought it for them for Christmas. They love it. Just what they needed to get their home set up. My son has been using them to cook for himself and thinks they are great. Definitely recommend.
5,Great set of pans for the money!,"After having a set of cookware for more years than I care to remember, I finally decided to purchase a new set. This set is wonderful. It cooks fast and cleans up fast. And, so far, it is totally non-stick. I love it."
5,Great Set!,"I own this set and I love it. It heats evenly and is lightwight and east to handle without the handle getting too hot. I've owned the set 6 mos and use it nearly every day with few problems. For the price it is very good. I want to leave a message to others. Please, please, please try the cookware out before you rate it and rate the PERFORMANCE of the COOKWARE. Don't give it a one or two star rating because of the way the box looks or because it was made in Saskatchewan. It's fine that you want a made in USA item, but you're not helping anyone determine how well the cookware is going to perform. I want to know about the cookware itself, not about your dissatisfaction with the Zen Buddhist that made it."
2,Kitchen Aid,"I am disappointed with these item that I purchased. The lid seems to leak on the sides of the pot and water flowing over the lid when boiling something and leaves a big mess on my stove top. It's been more than 10 years that I used same brand named and thought about trying this brand, first time to use kitchen aid cookware. The only thing that I like about this product is the nonstick coating on it and the frying pans. Overall, I will NOT recommend this if you do a lot of cooking and will use the pots that leaks."
1,Black coating on outside of pan washes off in dishwasher. Only had the pans for three weeks. Inside seems good.,"I purchased the 10 piece KitchenAid Gourmet Essentials Hard Anodized Nonstick cookware about three weeks ago. The first time I washed the small pan in the dishwasher, a lot of the black outside coating of the pan washed off. What did not wash off could be rubbed off. Set was suppose to be worth 300.00 and on sale for 120.00. Now I know why."
2,Another misfitting pot lid,"Like Ms. Gatewood, I bought this set of pots and pans and found a misfitting lid-this time to the 3 quart saucepan. The pots look great, and I hope to use them soon, but I also have to hope that Kitchen Aid will send me a new lid. Once they respond, I'll write a follow-up review."
4,Great product for great price,"The overall set is fine but it would be nice to have some extra options like boiling vegitables. The lids does not have pressure pin, which would be better to control overflow to ovens etc. The frying pan is not very deep for frys.Overall it is good for small family"
5,I Would Do it Again,"I'm so glad I bought these. I researched, checked around and chose these hoping I would be happy. I am and the set is the right size for me. I had too many pans taking up space and when I got rid of all of them, tired of having things I didn't use, I settled for this and all pans are used - Don't pay more for a bunch of pans that aren't necessary."
5,Great Value - Great Quality,"I sold a Pampered Chef set of cookware to purchase this KitchenAid set. I have a great set with money left over!!! It's a great value and the quality is comparable to Pampered Chef without the high price!! I'd recommend it to everyone!! Remember, don't put it in the dishwasher! :)"
4,Smaller than anticipated,"This is a nice set for a single person or small family, I think. Each item is smaller than I'd thought. Not sure if the exact measurements were on the ad. Also: I've made the mistake in the past of washing pots with this finish in my dishwasher. A MISTAKE. Wash by hand only to assure 'long-lastingness' (Yep, I know that's not a real word!)"
4,Really Good..,"I really like the set... the only issue I have faced is that since it is not so heavy, it tends to tilt and is not stable on the gas range of the pan is empty. That is because the handle is heavier than the pan base. Other than that the pan is working out well. I would like to use it in the dishwasher, but it's hand wash till now. You won't regret buying this if it is for everyday use and you want it to last for the next 5 years. Another good thing I like about it is that it is light. The other hard anodized pans that I have are really heavy and coz my hand to ache... for everyday use, I love this."
5,Great Cookware All Around,"I love this set. My husband loves this set. We aren't gourmet chefs by any means, but this makes it easier to cook without all of our food sticking to the pans. We wash dishes by hand anyway, so this isn't anymore difficult to care for than our old pots and pans. My only wish is for lids to fit the pans. Everything else was pefect. Love it, would recommend it to anyone that cooks on a regular basis. We got it when it was down to 99.99, so watch for sales."
5,great cookware,"i looked quite a bit before i purchased this cookware.found it at koals, but was cheaper at amazon with no sales tax, was much better deal.i am very happy with it. and will buy more kitchenaidskillets when i find the deal.it comes clean perfectly and am using silicone so i do not scratch it and hopefully will last a long time."
4,Happy to have nice pots and pans,"These pots and pans are very nice, a great deal for the price. They really are non stick and clean up is easy. I have hand washed them each time and have not put them in the dishwasher. I do agree with another reviewer who said that it can be tricky to clean around the rivets. But, I am very happy with the set and I think they will last a good long while."
4,Good price for the products,I bought this as a gift for my daughter. After looking at several brands this seemed to be the best for the money. She just loves them. Just remember to preheat the pans so they don't stick.
2,Not happy with this purchase,"I was really excited when I first got these. The pots are a good heavy weight. Then I realized that the outside of pots would scratched easily. I was so disappointed, but I knew they would be unsightly in no time around our house."
2,Kitchen Aid 10pc set,I received my Kitchen Aid 10pc set in good time and in good shape. I went to use my large pot with lid yesterday and the lid will not fit on my pot. I believe I was shipped a reject from the factory and was not told this at the time I ordered this item. I would like to know what I am able to do about this.
1,BAD choice Big mess,"After having cooked with mis matched pans for 20 years I finally was going to treat myself with a complete set. I looked diligently at many sets, I wanted the best quality for the best price. Although this set does distribute the heat nicely. A few people had made comments about the oxidation of the outsides of the pans, I thought what's the big deal? I should have paid attention. I have owned this set for close to 2 years and have regretted it ever since. It constantly ruining my dish towels with a horrible grey residue. I'm sorry but I am not going to hand wash my pans every time. It's ridiculous the mess they still make. I hate these pans. Even though they do the job okay. The mess they make, even after scouring is unbelievable! Do not buy these pans!!!"
5,Great Kitchenaide Product,I highly recommend this set. It has great ergonomics. The padded handles really help to avoid burning your hand. These are an excellent addition to any kitchen!
4,good for now,"I was pretty excited about my first cookware set. It's all true, the easy cleaning, the nonstick.Well, I think one of the frying pans could be a little bigger. But otherwise, I use every piece on a regular basis.Then it happened to me, that fat burned in at the outer surface and it won't go away, now two of my pots don't look that nice anymore.I am sure, that there is a better product out there, but for now it's all good."
5,never thought cookware would work so well,For a guy on his own this is the perfect cookware. Easy to clean and cooks things the way they should be cooked. Heat seems to be evenly distributed. I believe the fit of the also quickens the boiling in the pots. Rivets are sturdy so these pots and pans should last a long time.
3,Basic Cooking not for Entertaining,"My sister and I purchased this product as a gift for our mother. She loves the non-stick surfaces and the ability to store the lids in limited spaces, however I think she was disappointed with the size of the pots and frying pan. Very small compared to her older cookware. Was not anxious to get rid of her old oversized cookware as she often entertains a large family. Is perfect for family of two."
5,Wonderful,They not only were reasonably priced but they cook so well !! Nothing sticks !! Worth every penny . I bought them for my sister as a Christmas gift and all I have heard are great things .
4,Great system!!!!,this vantage point is a sharp looking shelving system. this is the second one i purchased. I could not find it cheaper anywhere not even on Ebay. not hard to assemble but you have to read the instructions carefully. i have one in my basement and bedroom. the 180 degree swing it has is great for off setting the shelves. the track has a place to store the wires. not a lot of room but it depends on how many devices you have hooked up.
2,Swivel is a design flaw,"The shelf looks nice, and I've not really had the problems described in some of the other reviews regarding the narrow cable channel. I used HDMI cables and it looks nice. The real problem with this shelf system is that the swivel feature is more of a design flaw than a positive attribute. The whole shelf hangs from the top bracket supported by a pin, so it can turn very easily, with just a touch. If you have kids or it's in a high traffic area I wouldn't really recommend it, because the corners of the shelf will constantly be banging against your wall. I would up eliminating the swivel feature by putting a few screws through the bar to provide resistance against the mount. Also, and this was really a problem of all the shelf systems, I wish the shelves themselves were a little bigger. Your components can crowd the shelf a little bit."
4,Clean,"Nice item looks clean ,at first look you might think it is not stable but to my suprise it holds up nice ."
3,component system,Looks great. Not so easy to install. But it really doesn't hide all of the wires if you have so many like I do. We have 3 components and it is alot of wires to fit through the tube and you still see the plugs into the wall.
3,Flo n' go,"I didn't trust the plastic hose clamps, so I replaced them with more durable metal hose clamps. The siphon pump itself works great, if you follow the instructions and allow gravity to help the siphon effect."
4,Pretty Darn Good,"so far so good. I used the product to siphen older gas out of my Generator and put in the lawn mower. I then purchased a 5 gallan gas can and set it up like a gas pump that I can use for either. Works well. Dont care for the handle hook, feel it should be better designed. but all in all a great product so far."
1,Flo N Go 08339 SuperFlo Pump,I used the Flo N Go 08339 SuperFlo Pump exactly 3 times before it fell apart! I was putting it away after filling the tank on my boat when the handle fell off in my hand. It was never dropped or handled roughly. I will look for anew gas can manufactured by another company before wasting any more of my money with this company!
1,piece of junk,was falling apart before i even started to use it. And putting the hoses on aren't an easy task unless your popye. This company has alot of work to do on this item.
4,Gas pump,"Very handy, filling up car, generator, is easy to use, very safe, seals to tanks. If you need to fill your generator tank or any other tank this sure helps"
1,dissapointed,it was used and i returned it i am sure if it was not i would have liked it but for the fact that they sent out a used item kinda annoyed me!
1,Didn't last 5 minutes,"First of all the hose that goes inside the gas container was not long enough so I had to replace that. More important, I managed to decant only 2 containers before the spout fell off! End of SuperFlo!"
1,cheaply made,"cheap plastic that I don't expect to last very long. I had to tape it together before the first use. Wanted to use to siphon water off of the pool cover, wish me luck"
2,Not Much Substance,"I don't know if I'm missing the mark here, but this album didn't quite catch my attention. The first track, ""I'd Rather Be Alone"" is a track that will catch attention of any slow jam fans. It's rhythmic, smooth, and catchy. It'll definitely make you want to sing along, if you're into pretending to be R&B superstars. However, the other tracks on this album starts to sound redundant, especially if you play the whole album at once. Mixing this CD with several others and shuffle-playing it might be a better option. If you play the whole CD through, by track 3 or 4, you'll start to feel that you've heard enough of the group. I personally didn't really like the whole album, but I will say that the first track is definitely one that'll last for a while."
1,This book needs proofreading,"You would think that a book specializing in a subject that requires precise attention to detail - proofreading - would actually have been proofread! In the answer section they have failed to notice mistakes in their own text. Mistakes such as the spelling of the word ""carrried"" in exercise 50, and inconsistancy of hyphen usage between exercise 49 and 50. There are numerous other mistakes, and lack of explanation and examples in many other sections. Another important fact that is not mentioned in the book's description is that it is designed for use in high school. The fact is, this book is not even suitable for school use. It will leave a lot of teachers with shrugged shoulders and red faces. Very sloppy."
4,puppies first toy,"I bought this guy for my puppy. It was so cute, my puppy used to lay on it as a pillow and drag it around the house. Then as he got older... he stared doing boy dog things to it -_-Now my dog is almost a year and a half and this toy is still holding strong! No holes, no limbs missing, and my dog still drags him around, plays fetch and tug with it, and cuddles with it when it's bedtime. The ONLY thing that came off was the string used to form the mouth. It's actually still attached but hanging off. Best toy ever."
4,Hours of fun for Uglydoll lovers!,"My daughters, ages 9 and 6, love the Uglydoll books and really wanted some of the stuffed Uglydolls for Christmas. This stuffed Gato Deluxe did not disappoint. It appears to be quite durable, and it looks just like Gato Deluxe does in the Uglydoll books. I would recommend this product to anyone who has children who enjoy these books and enjoy role playing activities."
3,Death By Pepperpots!!!!!,"A massive power loss strands the TARDIS on the planet Exxilon, where a wandering Sarah gets too close to the Exxilon city and is taken for sacrifice. The Doctor encounters an Earth expedition seeking a rare mineral that will help cure a space plague currently ravishing the human population but to get off the planet, he must get past the local natives and find out what is causing the power drain. Then the Daleks arrive...The last Pertwee Dalek story is one of his best. It has a lot of nostalgic value with the deadly roots from the city, the beaming city light noise and the intelligence tests (especially the quasi-chess board) within the city. Also one of the first times you get to see the Daleks frightened when they realise they have no destructive capabilities due to the power drain. A much more darker tone than previous Dalek stories. This is one to show the friends. RECOMMENDED!!!"
4,"Exterminate! Exterminate! Ext...oh, sorry, can't do that","The Doctor and Sarah Jane arrive on a mysterious planet where it seems the TARDIS is dying. They soon find a bid to find minerals needed to stop a space plague, but before long the Daleks arrive.Though this story has slabs of tedium later on with the Doctor in the grip of that old sci-fi cliche, the lost city, most of this adventure is entertaining enough to make it worthwhile.Not the best Dalek story ever in Dr Who by a long shot, the Daleks seemingly there to provide comic relief more often than not, but still worth watching."
4,My FavJon Pertwee Adventure - The Best of His Final Year,"I have to say, despite other negative reviews, this is my favorite Jon Pertwee adventure. I think the final Pertwee season is his best and the Chemistry between he and Liz Sladen (sorry Katy Manning enthusiasts) is excellent.The first and last episodes are the best in this. The TARDIS losing power in the beginning is very creepy and creates a nice tone. The Doctor's navigation through the Exxillon City in the final episode is also nicely executed.As I said, the final Pertwee year I think had some of the best stories (Time Warrior, Dinosaur Invastion, Death to the Daleks). Many in the US associate Sarah Jane with Tom Baker's Doctor and never realize she had a full season with Pertwee. If you like Pertwee era Doctor Who I highly recommend this."
3,Quite an average but interesting Dalek story,"The Tardis suffers from a power drain and lands on the planet Exxilon. The Doctor encounters an Earth expedition, a native race known as the Exxilons, and yet again, the Daleks. Although this story is nothing special, It has got a couple of interesting features. Like when you see the Daleks armed with automatic firearms instead of blasters. The only real let down is the cheap title."
3,"""Now the universe is down to 699 wonders...""","The best of the Pertwee Dalek stories! With the exception of the root and the sleepwalking guest actors, ""Death to the Daleks"" is very tolerable. The Daleks themselves are pretty good, their staging is swift and Michael Wisher's voices are fast and to the point. Even the Exxillons aren't all that bad. As I said, the guest cast and some rotten CSO in episode 1 really spoil everything. The story does feel a little inconsequential, since we really don't see the effects of the plague. And talk about horrible location shooting! The quarry does nothing to help this one. One has to wonder if the whole thing should have been studio bound to put more money into the budget. A story trapped inside the city would have been a lot more interesting. Still, it really isn't that bad, but you hardly call it ""a must see""."
3,mystery in the mansion,I purchased this book for my 11 year old son. We read it together and I found it very weird. I can't say it was the worst book I've read but it certainly wasn't the best. It is about good vs. evil and some very strange things happen during the story. I don't think I will read another book from this author.
1,Too Much Money for not so perfect fit!,This ShockMount does not fit the Blue Microphone that well!! So it should not represent the Blue at all!! Still receiving lots of noise from vibrations. Thumbs down!
1,The Shock,"This schockmount (The Shock) does not fit the Blue Baby Bottle microphone as the description states, there is no way to adjust it to fit either. I did return it and quicky recieved a refund without any problems, so I have no complaints. However, as of 01/21/13, the descrption remains the same so I thought I would post a review to make sure buyers are aware it does NOT fit the Blue Baby Bottle microphone."
4,"Heavy duty, reliable shockmount","I was astounded one day to find out that in my vast collection of vintage and new mics I neglected to purchase a shock mount for my Blue Microphones Mouse. Several sites were selling these for the un-Godly amount of $199.99. I waited for months and they finally listed on Amazon for around $49.99. I jumped at the deal and was not disappointed. This is a solid, heavy duty shock mount. My only complaint with Blue and why I only gave this four stars was that the suspension required considerable adjustment to center and equalize the tension. Otherwise the clamp holds solid and the suspension is accurately matched to the mic's weight."
2,"Nice Design, Lacking Quality","Purchased an orange version from Kohl's. Liked the design and multi comparments. However, after one leg of my business trip I noticed the bag had begun to fray along the edges where on most other luggage there is trim without fabric (usually a plastic or rubber trim). Also there was some fraying along the zippers. Wish I could have kept it as it's definitely unique looking, but I returned it and will look for another supplier."
3,good product,"It is real a good product, which looks very strong and well made. The delivery is very fast, I got it in the next day! The reason I give three stars is that the bag I received is not the same color shown in the picture. Mine is gray all around!! I think it should be grey and light dark just as the picture shows, which looks better."
1,Arrived in bad condition,The bag looks nice but arrived in bad condition. There are scratches on the wheel and the handles including some on the bag itself. Looks like Amazon carelessle shipped a used/returned product when I ordered a brand new one. I am very close to a trip to Australia and this is too late to return the product too :(
1,Fell apart!,"Save your money. This is for someone who doesn't take planes. I bought it thinking it was tough and a great color (mine is green). It began to fall apart almost immediately. I am a women in my 50's and thought the sections would be nice for travel. I bought this duffel/suitcase to take on a two week trip to Patagonia. The first time out the seams began to come unsown. The next few trips were domestic and more problems erupted with zippers. The wheel went wonky shortly after and now it only rolls as if a brake was on. Definitely not worth the money. I have Samsonite suitcases and LLBean duffel that have lasted through far more and still have held together. They don't look as cool, but they work."
4,nice bag,Very nice duffle bag for traveling. I like the way you can expand it if needed. I would recommend this for the occasional traveler like myself.
5,A Top-Notch Traveler,"This worked very well for my recent five day trip. I can't imagine using the backpack feature, given its size and weight when packed, but the easy separation between bottom and top sections was appreciated, and it wheeled well."
4,great bag!,this is the answer when you are not sure if you can get everything in one bag - now you have space for laundry and shoes separate from your clean clothes...great idea...easy to roll as well....Glad I picked this up
1,A Wonderful Subject Poorly Handled,"This is a good example of how NOT to write history. In about 200 pages we have a brief over-view of the whole history of France. Unfortunately, Cole tries to say too much--too many names and dates. In order to get all his names in Cole has little room left to explain anything important about history: wars ""break-out"" and artists ""come to"" Paris. Why any of this happens is without explanation.Even for the traveller with a passing interest in the history of France, this book in inadequate. There is no special attention paid to places of interest to travellers; there is little mention of the great artists and cultural figures of France, and the history included in often written in an uninspired manner that will bore most readers.If you are going to France and what some history, look elsewhere."
3,"interesting topic, poorly handled","The text is poorly written - often it is unclear who the author is even referring to. For example, ""he died a year later."" Well. . . . who?? Many such examples where if you don't already know the history, you may feel a bit lost."
1,Boring...,"The subject is not definetely boring but this book is. Why? the relation of events are handled poorly, daily life is not written, the place of France in Europe in terms of political status or economical status is not written. It is like a reference book giving the dates and people names, who married to whom, who administered what part of country. This is definetely not history. I am still looking for a good book on France's history."
5,Awesome saddle,"Very comfortable saddle. I use this one on my mountain bike for local rides. Very comfortable, relief in the needed areas. Don't care for the little Rx symbol on the saddle but other than that its awesome. Good price, local shops wanted 80.00 for it."
3,Cheap and Effective But...,As a previous owner of two health food stores I would say this is an excellent product for the money. My biggest compliant however is that it uses galatin instead of veggie caps. It amazes me that many in the health don't understand how important this element is to many consumers. I will look for alternatives unless this product changes it's capsules.
2,Too thick,Soluble but not disolvable. Turns into paste and gritty. Would not buy again. :-(The generic generic Benefiber is THE BEST!! I put it in my coffee every morning and I never know it's in there :-)
5,"Powder soluble fiber is excellent, especially for the price!","I am now on my second jar of Yerba Prima soluble fiber (the powder kind, not capsules). Works great! I use it in a morning smoothie to help me get and stay full, and let me tell you it works like a charm! Also has the other properties of soluble fiber, which is good for my digestive system."
3,Interesting but flawed.,"There are some really interesting tidbits in this book and I think it's a good read, most especially for some of the drink recipes (the one for Bourbon Sours is excellent). However, the author does tend to lose focus and ramble on about personal things that aren't even remotely as interesting as the non-personal anecdotes. In addition, when she refers to Allen Ginsberg as Allen Ginsburg and his famous poem as The Howl (it's just called Howl), her research talents (not to mention knowledge of things someone of her generation should be familiar with) are rather suspect. The rift between fact and error in that one example makes me seriously doubt the veracity of much of the book's other claims."
2,Drink Recipes are Awful,"I tend to agree with the last reviewer--the author's research is spotty at best, yet she speaks with such authority as to brook no disagreement.It's odd that she claims to draw on and respect the history of the cocktails contained, that she positions herself as a cocktail purist, and yet her recipes are almost unfailingly modern twistings of the originals.The worst is her martini recipe: 5 drops of vermouth! That's not a martini, it's chilled gin."
1,"Looks nice, broke immediately",Out of the box this item matched our kitchen perfectly. We were instantly impressed with the one hand tear feature and the amazing clicking sound. However after less than 48 hours the clicking was no more and the paper towels spin like a whirling dirvish.I would not recommend this to anyone and worse yet there is no way to contact the seller to request a replacement or a repair for the cheap click wheel inside the unit.I suggest you look elsewhere and don't purchase this item.
1,JUNK JUNK JUNK and who packs these boxes monkeys?,The thing first off is way to tight so the paper towel tears before you get what you want. The item arrived loose in the box flopping around and had broken plastic pieces a loose main stem and loose tear bar. The thing looked like it had been sitting in someones garage for a year. I think I will be sending this back. DO NOT BUY this it is junk.
3,"""Perfect"" for a while","I never would have thought my first review would be for a paper towel holder. This works so well, that I am compelled to add my 5-star rating to this item. It looks great, is sturdy, and provides easy one-handed paper towel pulling and ripping while staying in place. This really is the ""perfect"" paper towel holder.Update: after two years, the resistance has decreased to the point where we have to hold the holder with one hand while we pull and tear with the other. So while I suppose anything that last two years these days is a plus, I'm a little disappointed in this item now."
4,Dented Perfect Tear,Item received with side/top of base dented in four places. Replacement sent quickly but unfortunatly it arrived with one dent also! Decided to just turn it so dent could not be seen easly. This item has a heavy base and came very poorly packed both times! The towel roll holder works very good.
5,Just Perfect,This is an awesome paper towel holder. You can easily get one and only one paper towel at a time using one hand only. Just perfect. I love it.
3,Paper Towel Holder,"This is an excellent product. Thus far, I have given one to 5 of our 6 children as gifts. The only reason I rated this one as a 3 is because it arrived damaged. It had a dent in the base and the rod that holds the towels was wobbly because of it."
3,paper towel holder,"When I received it there was a dent in the base which wasn't a big deal as I put the dented side to the back. Now after 3 weeks, the ratcheting action has stopped and it binds when turning."
3,Not what I thought!,"I just bought this at CostCo, thinking it would tear paper towels with a razor cutter (or something) to any size you want. Turns out it's just a nice paper towel holder with a ratcheting sound. Am I missing something?! I guess I'll be returning this one."
5,LOVE IT!!!!!!!,"Just love this paper towel holder, the stainless steel works well with my kitchen decor, it performs as promised (one hand tear). Love the clicking sound it makes when you get a paper towel. Very Sound product, would purchase again. A steal at 19.99"
4,Perfect Tear Paper Towel Holder,"This product does just as the name describes. It has a heavy weight bottom, so it does not move when you tear off a paper towel. I am very pleased with this."
3,"M.Kamenstein 4536 perfect Tear Paper Towel Holder,Stainless Steel","Am disappointed. It hardly ever dispenses one sheet at a time, and have to use two hands most of the time. I should have returned it."
1,Perfect tear Towel Holder,"After a few months the ratchet action stopped. I took it apart and the ratchet action was created by flimsy plastic parts which simply broke off!Looks good, but poor quality!"
3,Could be a great product.,"I ordered two of these towel holders, and one works very smooth. I can pull off one to four sheets with one hand very fast and easily. The other isn't near as smooth operating, but if I pull near the bottom by the heavy base I manage most of the time until the roll becomes low. The unit that works smoothly has a little dent in the base from being packed poorly for shipping, and the one that doesn't work so well has a larger dent in it from poor packing also. They arrived on different days packed the same way. A few scant air pillows for shipping protection aren't enough with the heavy bases these units have. They are built very well and worth the money, but I'd think twice before buying one that I couldn't inspect for shipping damage first."
5,Great Product!,"I would suggest this product to anyone. I does exactly what the description of the product says it does. With kids, obviously, grabbing a paper towel while in a hurry without worrying about pulling off the whole roll is fantastic. It is solid, will not fall over, and it matches just about any decor. Great Product!"
1,do not buy,"The positive reviews this has received likley got written too fast - because these are great for about the first month or so, but the ratcheting mechanism DOES break eventually, and I dont mean months or years, more like weeks. I would rather pay an extra 5 buck (even 10) for a METAL ratcheting mechanism instead of the cheap plastic garbage these internals are made of. It is not a fluke that a few people get a bad one - I have gotten about 4 of these over the years in hopes they would have gotten the problem fixed, but I give up."
1,Broke on the first day,"Although the towel rack arrived with the small post slightly bent, it didn't seem to effect operation, so I was going to keep it. First roll of paper towels goes on, I hear the ""click-click-click"" sound as I pull off the first paper towel, and it works perfectly. Pull a few more, one sheet at a time, perfect. Call my wife in, she pulls a couple off, perfect. That evening, getting ready to eat dinner, go to pull our first paper towel for actual use-- and I get no ""clicks"", plus it pulls off several sheets instead of just one. Play with it some, nope, the ratcheting mechanism is broke, just as other reviewers here have reported. It's going back.Great idea, but lousy execution."
3,Best paper towel holder ever - until it breaks.,"We've had a wall mounted Kamenstein Perfect Tear paper towel holder which has worked wonderfully almost two years. Like others have reported, the plastic ratcheting mechanism on our paper towel holder recently broke (the plastic spider with 4 spokes had two spokes broken off). I'm not sure if just the broken spider could be replaced, but if so, it would be a relatively easy fix.I wrote to the Kamenstein folks (Lifetime Brands), and asked if I could get replacement parts for the one that is broken. they want me to send the paper towel holder to them (at my expense), and they will replace it. They said to be sure to include tracking with my shipment to them. They mentioned that replacement can take 4 to 6 weeks.Our towel holder is in the kitchen by the sink, and gets usage several times a day. After looking at the ratcheting mechanism, I don't see any way that the plastic ratcheting assembly will not break, even with only mild usage."
2,only stainless up top,"The bottom rusted right out and it's not like we kept it in the sink. I'd make sure you only put it down on perfectly dry surfaces. I'm going to put some Rustoleum on it and see if we can't extend its life, but I tend to like my paper towel holders to be a little lower maintenance."
1,New Product looked used,I ordered this item new and it appeared used and damaged right out of the box. I returned it immediately and bought one from the Linens 'N Things liquidation for the same price. THAT one is great and works perfectly.
1,Will not stay standing up right,"Pole that you put paper towel on wobbles, can't tighten leans to the side I have tried to fix and its hopeless I am very disappointed. Would not recommend!"
5,Perfect!,"I have had one of these ratchet paper towel holders for years. Unfortunately, I don't know the details about the manufacturer or model. But mine looks just like the photo associated with this one. It is flawless. I can tear off the towel smoothly with one hand; the holder doesn't skid on the counter. I can't imagine why anyone would have any other kind. I am currently looking for a second one for my beach house. It is absolutely perfect."
3,Not the worst or best,"We tried a lot of paper towel holders. this is not the best, but at least it works decently. The post bends too easily at the bottom, where it attaches to the base. But once striaghtened up, the thing works if one ios careful not to bend it off or exact vertical. The little other small guide post on the base does absolutely nothing."
4,Great One Handed Paper Towel Holder,"What can I say, it works great but the base could be just a bit heavier and possibly have the option of suction cups on the bottom."
5,Fits The Decor. Works Well.,"The kitchen paper towel dispenser just got replaced. The new one is a Kamenstein Perfect Tear Stainless Steel stand-up model. The replacement was for several reasons. One, our other one was flat black and didn't fit the kitchen decor as well. The new stainless steel model blends with the appliances much better and looks rather nice. Second, the old one always seemed to be unraveling the paper to a great degree whenever it was used and it became annoying. The Kamenstein is much better and a little ratchet keeps the paper from freely unraveling. And, last, but not least, people were always borrowing the kitchen dispenser and taking it all over the house without bringing it back. Well, now we keep the old one in the main bathroom so maybe it will cut down on the borrowing and transporting, at least that's the idea.Gary Peterson"
2,paper towel holder,"This paper holder is difficult to use with one hand. The paper roll spring is so tight that you have to hold the top of the roller in order to tear a single sheet of paper towel. If oyu do not hold the top the paper towel roller tips over instead of allowing you to tear the paper. Kind of defeats the purpose it was purchased for, to tear a single sheet with one hand."
1,Too Much Resistance,"I encounter too much resistance when trying to pull towel out for tearing. There is so much resitance that the base moves, unless I perform the procedure with both hands."
5,This is a GREAT CD,"If you like Steel Pulse, you will love VEX. The cuts are a combination of ""roots"" and a more modern sound. That is, the songs often incorperate elements of rap and dancehall genres with their signature ""roots"" sound. Truly a rewarding music from one of the best bands in the world!"
5,VOICE OF AN ANGEL!,"One of the most beautiful CD's ever produced and Cecilia has such a wonderful voice. She makes these glorious songs come to life! So, sit back, relax and enjoy this music that will surely make your heart smile!"
5,Great book for anyone interested in Egyptian mummification,"Wrapped for Eternity gives the reader a detailed description of how the Ancient Egyptians mummified their dead. It is a wonderful resource for anyone interested in Egyptian pyramids, mummies, King Tut, and the Egyptian afterlife."
4,Some tracks from their early recordings.,"Yes, this cd have their early recordings commencing from 1961-1968 which I was glad that they had my favorite song Summertime. Otherwise, I need to hear the rest of the songs to give a thorough review."
5,"An insightful, true testimony","The View from a Monastery: The Vowed Life and its Cast of Many Characters is the spiritual memoir of Brother Benet Tvedten, who has been a Benedictine monk for almost fifty years. An inside look at not only the faith and commitment of monastic life, but also the foibles of monks as fallible human beings, Written in kindly, engaging prose, The View from a Monastery reflects on the values of stability and commitment to a humble way of life, and bonds of community. ""Benedictines, Hutterites, and Native Americans are subjects of interest because we all live apart from mainstream society. We belong to 'intentional communities'. On a particular day, however, members of each group may be found shopping at Wal-Mart. After all, we are not totally withdrawn from the world."" An insightful, true testimony to the ups, downs, and satisfactions of dedicating oneself to a monastic way of life."
3,This game could be better.,"I enjoy this kind of game but there is no real tutorial like there should be for people who've never played a game like ths before. There is no pause button that I've seen, so you have to keep playing the game or quit to get it to stop running while you're out of the room and I can't seem to find a way to change the screen view.It's a good game but takes a lot of time to figure out."
3,Not Bad at All,"Okay, although Zoo Tycoon Marine Mania is better, this game is not bad at all. There are two things I do oppose to this game:Not being able to rotate the screenThings break down all too often and it gets very annoying. I have to hire loads and loads of mechanics.Apart from that, this game is OK. If you want a little bit of simple entertainment, buy this game."
3,In the Middle,Please do not buy this game if you are not up to a long time figuring out how to play it.
3,Not as fun as I thought,"I expected this to be a lot of fun, but it isn't. There's no real guide to the game, so a lot of the little details (how to raise the beauty rating, park rating, buildings broken down, descriptions of different buildings--what they do, etc) has been left out. Freeform is kind of nice, but you can't practice raising the beauty rating. Scenarios are ok, but the intermediate scenarios are a lot harder than they should be. If you really like a challenge, this is for you. But I was expecting a little more."
4,Fun Game,This is a really fun game. You take care of all your animals and hire all your emploees. If a building is broken you have to call a mechanic and other stuff like that. You can buy a bunch of cool rides and you can choose to start with an empty lot or a partially built park. The only thing is you have only have to build a Shamu stadium and make a good park and that's it. After that you don't have anyhting you have to do. Overall I think this is a really fun game.
2,Too much sizzle not enough steak,"When I first started using this book I thought it was helpful, but when I needed help and information about entering transactions, I realized the shallowness of the book. The author knows a lot about business issues, but I needed bookkeeping help, I needed to understand what to do and why to do it that way.I recommend you buy Quickbooks The Offical Guide instead if you want to learn Quickbooks inside and out - which is the only way to get the software to do exactly what you need."
4,Thoroughly enjoyable!,"This is a delightful read for anyone familiar with Washington, DC and northern Virginia. Having lived there for a great many years, I had great fun following along with the adventure. And, it is a good story! I couldn't put it down; really wanted to know how it would turn out. I did not find it too ridiculous to include so many known people. As a gambler and man about town it seems reasonable the hero would be acquainted with a wide range of characters in what was a relatively small community at the time. And, he only claimed acquaintance! Recommend it highly and intend to send it to some of my friends back in VA."
4,"Good set of manuscripts, some odd translation choices","I researched the philosophies of the translators before deciding to purchase this version, and I like their stated goals. In practice, they seem to have made some odd decisions that go against their own ideas. I noticed a few words here and there that aren't a literal translation of the original at all, but are rather based on what they think a passage in another book means. ie. there is a spot in Genesis (granted, this is the NT, but I also acquired a copy of Genesis, and it's the specific example that comes to mind) where what is written as serpent gets translated Shining one. Translators notes say that this is because of some passage in, I think it's Ezekiel, where the devil is called the Shining One. Interesting, sure, but I want to know what it actually says; not some transposition from a totally different book, and it's not the sort of thing you would expect after reading the stated goals of the project."
2,Lacking,"It is written in paragraph form. If you like that then its ok. I prefer traditional double column text. The translation is supposed to be top notch. Its a little to far out in pros or style away from the AV for my taste. I have AV easy reader versions and they read much better; in my opinion. No matter what bible version I try I always end up back at the King James. Anyway the ISV is available on line so my advice is to take advantage of it for free on line.Sincerely, RF Lorenzo."
5,ISV,The book is a thick compared to other New Testaments because it is a preview copy. It is not on thin Bible paper and also the print is large. I am very pleased with the book and it was as advertised.
1,Not Poetic at All,"There's nothing poetic about this translation, unless you think forced rhymes, awkward syntax, dated diction, and a generally unnatural and unartistic chime are characteristics of (good) poetry. The whole idea is stupid in the first place. Use the ESV if you want a good translation."
2,SWANN 4 CHANNEL DIGITAL VIDEO RECORDER,"OVERLY COMPLEX PRODUCT AND MANUEL, AND THE PRODUCT DID NOT LIVE UP TO ITS DESCRIPTION OR NAME. MANUEL LEAVES A LOT TO BE DESIRED. ALSO, SHOCK TO FIND OUT IT DID NOT HAVE A HARD DRIVE. NEVER HEARD OF HAVING TO BUY A HARD DRIVE FOR A DVR. IF IT IS A DVR I EXPECT IT TO RECORD. HOW CAN IT RECORD IF IT DOES NOT HAVE A HARD DRIVE--THE PRODUCT HAS NO OTHER METHOD OF RECORDING. INSTALLED THIS WEEKEND AND STILL HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE IT OUT AND TO RECORD ANYTHING. THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PRODUCT SHOULD MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THERE IS NO HARD DRIVE!!!!"
4,Dave Pearce Total Euphoria Review,"If you're into feeling music, Dave Pearce brilliantly and successfully establishes this desire. Both CD's take you on a joyful roller coaster ride through soft and bouncy tones. The beginning is slightly mellow but the different layers of pitch sounds make you feel elevated.As Pearce mixes the different tunes, he slowly yet delightfully teases your senses leaving you with a craving felling. While the beginning is melodically geared to make you feel comfortably at ease, the BPM's slowly increase to put you in a bouncy mood. Whether you want to start off slow and work your way up the BPM latter or go straight to the bouncy stuff, rest assure that ""Total Euphoria"" fulfills both moods.This is a must have CD. It is everything but boring. For some its an acquired sound and for others, its intuitively sound. I recommend this CD with high regards, it ""calling your name""."
3,Not Quite Junk,"Undercover narc and terminal fashion victim Fabio Testi takes on dope peddlers with the help of a surprisingly spry David Hemmings in this trashy, but kind of fun, outing. Stick around for the final half hour, where seemingly every mode of transportation available to the filmmakers is employed in a wild chase. Crack open a Peroni and goof on the poorly dubbed rest of it."
4,A Treat,"A sweet, cheeky job of analyzing the controversy over a four letter word. Unabashedly biased, despite the presence of both Hunter S. Thompson and Alan Keyes. For all it's celebration of free speech and fairly contemptuous treatment of the censoring impulse, it did give the best defense of censorship I've ever heard, via Miss Manners. She made the very sharp observation that simply as a matter of growing up, children will test boundaries. Why not give them one that's fairly harmless? I had flat never thought of that. She may have a point.I was particularly charmed because my constitutional law professor, David Skover, was one of those interviewed. I'm a *teeny* bit worried about the . . . let's say contextualization of the clips as my con law prof's last statement, as presented, is *quite* misleading. But, for those of us in the know, hil-ar-ious.Quite fun."
4,Good documentary,"This was along the lines of the Aristocrats! I was really happy to see some Hunter S Thompson in there. Drew Carey hits the best note with the suggestion for the next documentary, because this word is almost passé by now, whereas that word (the 'c' word) is still more taboo."
3,A Fun Subject Matter That Occasionally Gets Bogged Down in Over-Analysis,"A long-form inspection of the most infamous word in the English language, with insights from all walks of life. Comedians, talk show hosts, politicians, musicians, linguists and historians all chime in on the weight a simple four-letter concoction can carry, and whether our society is in the right or the wrong for placing such a special value on it. The natural bases are covered: censorship, religion, root origins, liberty and social conservatism, with amusing dalliances into the wildly different applications for the F-word and its unique status as a noun, verb, adjective, adverb and simple sign of emphasis or excitement. It does drag on at times, but clever editing and some tremendous sound bytes, particularly from Scottish comedian Billy Connolly, always manage to pull it back from the edge. Fair, insightful and funny, if not all it could have been."
1,The book is not advanced,"Do you want read a 6-page chapter with less than 20 citations? You have found a great book. Overall, I do not like this book because there are less information than expected. I wished this book summarized better and organized better growing thoughts and results of the cell cycle control in plant growth and development. Several chapters describe just individual research projects, which are suitable for research articles in journals. Also, they do not have reviewed other publications sufficient enough for satisfying students and researchers who are going to step inside this area. If you want to read more in-depth knowledge, you'd better go to library and find a recent reveiw article."
3,Too Light,"Too light but that depends on what You use If for. I use It to as a outer cover for Water hoes then with the uses of a hair dryer thaw out My Water lines, but threading My Water lines through It, It tears apart too easy but Not as bad a dryer vent hose. The best thing I have found for Water lines Is If possible go to Lowes and get some 4' flexible sewer drain line this method works much better than heat tape You can use far less heat tape and You do Not always know If the heat tape works or Not."
3,Not so great,"It seemed to be a really good MP3 player when we first got it, but now after only 2 months, it keeps locking up. Couldn't register it with D-Link because there's no serial number on the back. They tell us to try sending it back to ...them."
4,Good Jukebox,"I've had the RoqIt for about two months now. Most of the time it worked fine, but it would also to lock up, skip and generally mess up every so often. Then one day one of the connectors to the battery fell off and I sent it back under warranty to get it repaired. Now it is much better. I use it as a portable radio station while I'm driving with it on random and it is great. It sounds like they have a problem with the power connectors to the battery, but they repair it with no problems. Recommended."
1,I wish they had a choice of less than a star,"This is the worst electronic equipment I have ever invested in, this player had bugs and defects packed into it right out of the factory, it is hardly surprising that DLink decided to discontinue the production of this unit. What adds insult to injury is that instead of owning up to their obligation to provide care within the warranty period, DLink customer service is playing games to claim that the warranty is void. This is a sheer case of shrugging any responsibility. As a paying customer I am totally dissatisfied with the product and the customer care(what makes me feel better, is that there are at least 3 other people who share my view and that means that DLink will find it extremely hard to survive in this world of customer delight)NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM DLINK!!!a few dollars 25 more(competitive jukebox) is worth a functioning product.."
2,Was nice when it worked,"The first problem I encountered was a loose battery connection. I soldered the connection back on and it worked again. Then the power connection fell off, so I fixed that also. Now, after a year and a half after buying it, the unit is no longer functioning due to a 'partition' error. Tech support has no help for this problem, so I'm out $$$.I'm giving this device 2 stars because when it was working, it had good sound quality (with separately purchased speakers) and was convenient.Overall, there has got to be a similar mp3 player that is constructed better. I would NOT recommend buying this player."
3,doesn't contain conversion software,"I've always wanted all of my 100 or so cd's on one player. I couldn't findan XP friendly device until i came across this thing. It is designed to work as both an mp3 player and a USB hard drive. The mp3 function did not work. Fortunately for others, the mp3 function didn't work because I had to use the worst music software in the world... (GASP)... RealJukebox. That is the only reason why the mp3 playing function didn't work. The contols looked confusing, and d-Link could have improved the design by more than just the device's bulk (it was quite large). The hard drive function, however, works to perfection. The major flaw is that it doesn't come with ripping software, so you will need MusicMatch 6.0 or 7.0 to do anything good with it."
3,"Amazing capability, but doesn't travel well....","I love having 10 GB of music with me, and the Roq-it is small enough to travel in a bag or carry around the gym. I'm satisfied with the battery life, and the blue display is bright and fairly easy to navigate. Here are two problems, though, both related to the operation of the internal hard drive:1) Shaking, jarring, or jogging with the device are verboten: it skips worse than a portable CD player.2) Moving through the menu is slow, and worse, it's not uniformly slow, being faster or slower at times for no apparent reason. This, I think, is some of ""lock-up"" other reviewers have noted. In my experience, the machine usually isn't locked, it's just stuck for a few moments (which seem to last forever). We're used to speed, and this is annoying.For the price (it's steep) I don't think I'd purchase this item again."
3,Just an FYI from the D-LINK Website,"D-Link Systems, Inc. has issued an End of Life (EOL) Notice for the DMP-HD610 and has discontinued production of it as of Thursday, August 01, 2002. Technical and RMA support for this product shall continue until Sunday, August 01, 2004."
5,This is a great product but can be bought for L E S S,T H E S I T E T O F I N D I T F O R L E S S I S COMPUPLUS . C O M.
1,I hate this case,this case that this thing comes with is very weird its very very hard to get the thing in but it has holes that align up the the headphone jack usb port ac power place line out and the power switch and its kinda hard to press the buttons on the side either side of the face of the thing like thisX XX XThats kinda what it looks like the x's represent buttons theres more buttons than that but those are the annoying ones. You kinda have to push the plastic covering pretty hard because the plastic is tight because the case is too small the machine is too big the the buttons are on the like a curve. By the way it a bit hard to get it in the case too
3,Works Great but Read the Specs....,"D-Link says this is a 7.7 ounce player, but check the specs. It's huge. The 7.7 ounces is without the battery, carrying case and harness you'd have to buy to run or exercise with it.Yes, it's half the price of the Apple iPod, but it's twice the size. Again, this thing is HUGE. It would be better advertized as a portable hard drive that also plays mp3s. But if all you want is a portable hard drive, you can do much better in terms of size.It does work well, installs easily, and at 10 GB it has twice the storage of the iPod. But the iPod also doubles as a portable hard drive and with the firewire it does downloads at about 40 times the speed of USB. Do you really need more than 5 GB in such a small package anyway? If you can switch to Mac conviently, iPod is the product you'll want.If you're stuck in the PC world, then Roq-IT seems to be the best alternative for now, but you just know that won't last long..."
2,Very Fragile,"I have bought this mp3 to be use in my car and home stereo. It is small but it does not fit in a pocket; Also it is a little heavy. The day I recived it, I have started to charge it and at the same time to move my music to it. Then by accident, I unpluged it from the power. The consequences were very bad. It stopped working. It could not access the hard drive. I am not at the US to return it so I hire somebody to fix it. He had to format the hard drive again and to repair a small pin that makes contact with the battery. Now it is working but sometimes it stop working and I have to reset it every time at least once per day. Also It does not organize your songs on the hard drive so it is a mess and If you have a large collection of songs. it will be very boring. The letter case is not very nice. The only good things are the capacity the speed to change songs and the Super screen very nice. (...)"
3,Works fairly well... for a while,"After having using the RoqIt almost daily for the last 5 months, it works really well, with some exceptions. The problem I have found most recently, the battery contact has broken, making the battery useless and requiring the unit to be plugged in for power. (Hopefully the manufacturer will fix this) Also, the random play only seems to use songs from a few folders instead of all as it seems like it should. It also suffers from random lockups which stop the music when you least want it to. The carrying case and the remote are lacking as well. On the plus side, the sound quality is decent, and the the backlight can be set to stay on all the time, which is nice for using in the car at night. Another nice feature is the ability to pick the next song you want to hear while the current one is playing."
2,D-Link Roq It,"Had it for one year. Locks up; cannot locate any vendor on Internet or locally who sells lithium ion rechargeable batteries for D-Link. Love to use, but not working well for short period of time. Mother of two; enjoys traveling with music. Thought this would be the best buy. Need to rethink next purchase of MP3 player."
4,Cindy,"I have subscribed to this magazine for the last year. There are good quality photos, hand & machine knitting instructions, and schematics for every pattern. However, instructions are sometimes on the same page, a few pages later, or in the back of the magazine--not consistent and sometimes challenging to find. It would be nice if the editor would have these in a consistent location."
1,No good Patterns - ever,"I have about two to three years of Knit N Style (2001 - 2003)Magazines, and lately have spent a lot of time looking through them for a Cardigan Pattern to Knit for myself. I haven't found a single one. All of the patterns have serious faults: Drop Shoulders, (totally unacceptable) little or no armhole, neck and/or shoulder shaping. Most sleeves have little or no cap. And, worst of all, they are all made in five or more pieces. Haven't any of these ""designers"" heard of Elizabeth Zimmerman? I was going to give the lot to the library, but am wondering if perhaps the trash might be a better place. If you are trying to attract new knitters from among younger people, why don't you teach them the PROPER way to knit? Young people are smarter than you think."
3,Depends on what you are looking for...,"I agree that this is by far NOT the best magazine a knitter could find. But I think I wouldn't go so far as to say 'most knitters find it to be a joke.' For example, there was recently a free pattern from 'Not Just Plain Jane Knits'. She is a serious and respected knit artist and this pattern retails at 25.00 - not to mention that Jane Elliot is hard to find except exhibiting at major knit shows. So, you wade through some pretty redundant and uninspiring offerings, and find a real treasure or two not replicated anywhere else. You occasionally spot an advertiser with a great new yarn, or you see a basic pattern you have somewhere in your stash, and decide to adapt this one rather than dig through all your books. It's not an expensive subscription, I don't hold my breath til it arrives, but I always come away with something and for me, that's enough."
2,Low Level Design and content,"The knitting - well, I have yet to find anything I'd want to make, so I can't comment on errors. The writing in the tech articles is aimed fairly low, but I've learned some things. Design is really cheezy, as someone else commented. This is sad, as knitting takes so much time and many people enjoy knitting in satisfying materials. The results should be something wonderful and lasting, but these are cheap-looking and tacky. I'm still looking for a knitting magazine that has good contemporary design. The free online magazine Knitty is the best I've found. I'd like a paper mag for reading in other places. I'll keep looking."
3,Get it right the first time or it's ruined.,"While better than the freebie screen protector that shipped with the phone, the sticky underside of this screen protector becomes a lint magnet if you peel it off -- and there is no getting something off the sticky side. Alas, the very cloth they give you for cleaning sheds lint from its edges.Do it in a clean room or get it right the first time -- and if it's just a little crooked, don't try to get it just a little straighter.My old screen protector was peeling and pitted -- now I have a screen covered with lint. I'm not sure a non-sticky solution would be better, but this one is underwhelming."
2,ROBOFLOP?,"I dunno, I don't wanna sound harsh but I've played better games. It seems like the path of the Superhero games. You read some great pre-release articles, then when the game hits the shelves it's a major disappointment. - The gameplay is difficult to get used to, it's like you're in Murphy's head and you got this gun sticking out from the bottom of the screen. You pan back and forth and when your sensor picks up a bad guy, even if he's in a building, you gotta aim pretty fast and waste him before he shoots at you or someone else starts shooting at you, otherwise your vision turns into a bad TV Channel and you're toast. Keep this with the Batman Dark Tomorrow game."
1,Horrible,"I wanted to like this game in a bad way. However, the lack of checkpoints, in-game saves and having no clue how to get out of the first level turned this game into a total headache."
3,Get your hands on the PC version,"If your a die hard Robocop fan, get your hands on the PC version, its not any better, but you can customize those horrible sound effects and even add your own music to the game."
2,"actually, it pretty much [isn't good}...","the graphics are ok but nothing spectacular. the gameplay itself would be good, except when you get an explosive charge (in order to blow up obstacles), no key works on being able to set it. so far i've played it 10 times and been unable to get out of the opening stage, so in my opinion this game [isn't fun]"

4,awsome,Its pretty cool because its just like the movie. You get a cool gun and your aiming is pretty easy. When you aim with your gun it tells you where the bad guy is just like the movie sequence.O yeah you also get thermal vision to see threw walls and stuff like that. And the graphics are awsome. For the first time you can be police officer Murphy or A.K.A. (Robocop)And expierience what its like to actually be Robocop and Shoot down bad guys with great graphics.
2,mediocre,Light on insight. The brevity of daily messagesdoes not allow for depth of development.Not even inspiring as a devotional.
2,Ok to learn some terminology,"I think the book was ok to get some basic terminology, but I felt it lacked any practical substance that would be useful, particularly for pediatrics"
4,An Interesting Set,"I just purchased my copy of the set today. I was glad to finally get my hands on it. I am a thankful person when DVDs are released for the sole purpose that some shows stop releasing after a while or are not released at all. So, that in mind, I will critique this on a purely fun point of view and not to seem unthankful in any way.I'm curious first off about the changes between Discs 1 and Discs 2/3. It almost seems like disc one was an earlier release. I mean, there's a Pokemon 4ever trailer on it? It's just weird.However, I like the slim case idea. I am a fan of the slimcases."
5,Pleased,"Each disc was clear of scratches or damage: new. Each case was in fine condition, and the box itself was also in fine condition. Excellent, I am very pleased."
3,For collector's only,"If you are new to Dr Who, there are better stories to watch, Brain of Morbius or Ark in Space would be a better first choice. Too much running around and not much of a solid plot, which is atypical of this great series. The Cybermen are brought back after years and they are reduced from being the menace they once were. I got this video strictly to increase my collection."
2,Not good as Who goes,"I can't imagine this being on anyone's top ten list of Doctor Who stories. In fact it barely makes Season 12's top 5 list (the only reason it does is because there are only 5 stories in season 12). There are a few good moments--Tom Baker shouting at Harry that he is an imbecile is quite funny--, but ultimately this tale fails to impress. Barring The Tenth Planet, this is probably the worst Cybermen story. If you want great Doctor Who, look for Pyramids of Mars, the Deadly Assassin, or Caves of Androzani, but not here."
2,worst Tom Baker story ever( a laugh all the same),"This has got to be boardering on comic relief. Is the production INTENTIONALLY bad? The worst thing of all is the annoying Cyber Leader seeming better at leading auctions and square dances, than mighty robot warriors with his string of announcements about his ""cyber superiority"". He is funny and I watch this one just for laughs. The music is not done by Dudley Simpson in the usual style(big mistake as this further detracts). Baker is very good at mocking the Cybermen, and they deserve it in this one. Sladen and Marter give a decent performance as does the commander and the two Vogan rivals. But the whole thing seems a bit washed. The script itself doesn't seem that bad, just the execution and production. Only Sly McCoy is worse than this."
1,You've run out of money and can't even afford a good script!,How anyone can like this rubbish is beyond me. Just a few examples of the awful dialogue: Doctor:You're just a pathetic bunch of tin soldiers scuttling about the galaxy in an ancient spaceship! Doctor:Harry Sullivan is an imbecile! They have obviously used the sets for The Ark In Space so its a bit unbelievable to think that Sarah doesn't think its the beacon! The scenes where the vogans are annihalated by the Cybermen are painful as they could of made gold bullets unless they were very bad shots! I'd of thought the cyberbombs had a bit more destructive power than a flame gun. The cybermen are just put in for figures of fun and really look like adverts for vacuum cleaners! The hidden humour is somewhat more impressive: Vorus:I had a dream! Genesis Of The Daleks and Terror Of The Zygons are more impressive.
4,"A somewhat weak story, but the extras are fantastic.","As others have said, this is one of the weaker of Tom Baker's early episodes. Baker and his companions are in good form, though, and the episode has some choice bits of dialog, neat gadgets, a very good space station set, and cave scenes shot in actual caves. The Cybermen costumes are somewhat weak (look, vacuum cleaner hoses!), and they aren't using their best shtick (""You will be made like us!"") but they are still fairly effective villains. Mainly it is the alien Vogans, with their unconvincing masks, overacting, and tedious subplot, that bog the story down.The extras on the disc go a long way to redeem it, however. In particular, a great documentary about videotape trading in the 1980's is almost worth the price of the DVD by itself.Overall, I would say that it is worth it to complete the story arc for the season, to get the extras, and to hear the Doctor's epic slam on poor Harry Sullivan!"
3,"Fun, but not outstanding","While not one of the best Doctor Who stories, and a bit spotty on continuity, this tale is elevated by some fine guest performances from Kevin Stoney and Michael Wisher, and the script does have some charming one-liners. The regulars turn in their usual fine performances -- Tom Baker is not yet jaded by the part, and Lis Sladen and Ian Marter are real troopers.The plot is complex enough to keep the viewer engaged but not so twisty that it leaves him scratching his head in confusion at the end.All in all, a pleasant enough way to while away a couple of hours."
5,Essential,"This one is one that any self respecting WHO fan must have. Anything from the Baker/Hinchcliffe era is absolute gold. Baker's first two years are the best in Who history: Genesis of the Daleks,Terror of the Zygons, The Sontaran Experiment, the list goes on. Thank GOD they are finally putting this one on DVD!!! Now if they'd just release Seeds Of Doom..."
2,CYBERMEN PUT OF!,One of tom baker's weaker stories mostly because of the poor part of the cybermen and the pathetic vogans!Its obvious the ark in space sets were reused due to lack of money in 75.Not the best of tom baker's first season but one of the poorest of cybermen appearances in DOCTOR WHO.
4,Good Collection,this is a Good Collection of songs that work.you can get your chill on to them&just relax. every Era has some standout Tracks that make a Compilation work&this one is a Good One.not quite Great but this is a Good Set.
5,A must have!,"Although we got tons of cute baby gifts, this one was by far, the most vaulable! We used it (and still do) every day to track the tremendous amount of information we needed to keep track of. Even our doctors found it useful when we had some troubles with feeding. I would strongly recommend it to help keep you organized and feeling sane during the crazy few days and weeks after birth."
4,New mom in OH,"I LOVE this organizer -- everything is in one place. My only suggestion would be to combine this book with a more ""traditional"" baby book (i.e. add journal pages, places for pictures, etc.) so everything really is in one place..."
5,Dark Tales from the Pacific N.W. Native Community,"The abduction Of Jessie Dancer,her time in captivity,birth of a daughter,and her eventual murder by a madman whom no one suspects.Thus begins a long dark trail of disappearances and murders haunting a small fishing community on the Washington coast.Lila Pinord's ability to tell a dark story,while including uplifting native american spirituality is superb.Very well done!!Having been hunting and camping in coastal Washington,I can attest to the spookiness of some areas of the dark woods there.I enjoyed the book-excellent reading. Jacamo Peterson Author"
4,Recipe for a great tale...,"take... one part of a picture book - like description from someone who is obviously in close contact with Mother Nature, two parts of devilish wrong doings, experienced and vividly explained by blood related women, three parts of instances where the native American gift of `envisioning' adds to the mystery, four parts of cold blooded killings from a man who calls himself a ...WHAT?...a Prospector... and countless parts of spine tingling chills and you end up with a wonderful, scary, well told tale.I might be off here or there on my measurements but let me tell you; the ingredients are what count.In Skye Dancer, Lila L. Pinord has brought together the right recipe for a story I can only describe with words previously used by reviewers: creepy and hair - raising.I enjoyed this tale very much, however; and I can NOT recommend it to be read....in the dark with JUST a reading light...Rebecca Lerwill, author of 'Relocating Mia'."
3,Not their best.,"This single and the remixes found on this CD would have gotten a solid review had it not been released by Destiny's Child. This trio has just set too high a bar in the past with club-ready singles like ""Bills"" and ""Survivor"" and ""Soldier"" just doesn't match up. Although the ""Maurice's Nu Beat Mix"" does enhance the song, and blending the male hip hop vocals that are usually withheled from remixes and blended into the mix here are a welcome addition, this track and this collection of mixes are just not up to par with DC's previous releases. The Rauhofer remix of ""Lose My Breath"" is a great addition, although the dance-hall sound of the original makes it pretty club-ready as it is."
2,Confusing,"Just a few years ago, Destiny's Child was singing about being ""Independant Women"". Now, in a blatant contradiction, Destiny's Child is singing about how they want a ""Soldier"" to take care of them. Pretty confusing if you ask me. The track itself sounds alright, the girls get a hand from T.I. (he's in everything) and Lil' Wayne who both drop pretty elementary verses. Alright song, but the message and the concept kinda threw me off."
1,Not at all what I expected,"I expected case studies, not a somewhat heavy-handed book of advice. For me, this was a waste of time and money. I tossed it into the ""circular file."""
4,The Real Deal,"If you've ever played RollerCoaster Tycoon and loved it this is the game for you .Imagine instead of building roller coasters you build cages for any dinosaur.You could put a Spinosaurus,a T-Rex,and 1/2 a dozen of raptors and watch a bloodbath emerge.But it isn't all about carnage you can mix dino DNA and create you own wrecking machine.Also you need to attract guests and if you do well enough extra money to waste or use for good use.There are also 12 missions if you want some action."
5,THE ONLY GAME NEEDED FOR XBOX,"This is by far the best game I have played for Xbox, besides Max Payne. I wasnt sure about buying it but i ended up and do not regret one bit. There is not one negetive thing to say about the game except that the 3's look like 1's and that may cause some confusion.......I now have a Four and a Half Star Park and nearly $400,000 dollars.......I absolutlty love this game......ITS ADDICTIVE"
4,My son loves this game.,"My son used to have this game for the gamecube and thoroughly enjoyed it. Through way too many dino battles, the disk finally wore out. When he found it for the XBox he talked me into ordering it for him. The disk came just as promised and was almost brand new as promised. He is back to creating new dinosaurs and fighting with the old ones. One of the best purchases we've made."
4,Jurassic Park X-Box game,"Very Happy with product! It was ordered right before Christmas and it made to our home in 3 days! Thank you for such a fast and speedy reply. Item was in great condition as promised. Thank you, would definitely recommend!"
5,operation genesis is great!,"This game is so fun.It is just fun to make jurassic park.It is genesis to make a game like this.I like making the dinosaurs,geting new atrractions,everything!I realy like making the dinosaurs get loose.You need to buy this game!"
5,Journey to the Xia Empire,"Excellent cinematography, story, moral, acting and directing yet w/ a limited budget. Sure wish they made movies like this these days."
2,Expensive and not worth it.,"This is a rebadged Micro Innovations webcam that you can purchase for much less if you skip the HP name and get the Micro Innovations webcam. This camera is a pain to install and the picture / video quality pales in comparison to other webcams in its price range. I bought one of these with my laptop, but I went back to my old Intel PC Camera I bought in 2001 because it took better videos.Overall, this is a very generic camera selling at a premium price. Sound recorded from the built in microphone sounds like it was recorded in a soup can.Drivers for the webcam can not be found on HP's home page, however they can be found at Micro Innovation's website [...]"
1,Poor performance,"This camera doesn't work properly, The video is very dark with normal indoor light, and the microphone is weak. I tried downloading the drivers from the HP website and still got the same performance.I am very dissapointed."
2,not the best camera,"the base of the camera is light and made of plastic, so the camera does not stay put on its base, but the base wobbles and moves around because it is so light. Windows XP plug and play does not recognize the camera even though it is USB. I was unable to find the driver for the camera on HP's website after trying for 1/2 an hour. If you lose the drivers that came with the HP product, it is quite difficult to try to find them on the internet of HP website!"
5,A book that closes the loop between theory and practice,"I was very pleased with this book. Not only does it cover a very useful area of design, it is very well written and very clear its approach to complex engineering. Although there are other books that cover similar material, I found this book to have a clear consise and pleasing delivery. I especially enjoyed that the author focused first on the basis of the problem - I liked the chapter on Inductance - and then folded the concepts into transmission lines. All the ""controversial"" elements are addessed from partial inductance to differential signalling. I have read many books on this subject and this one fits a nice niche between the heavy theoretical ( such as Clayton Pauls Tranmission Line)to the very basic.Overall - a very nice addition to anyones shelf!"
3,"""Gaelic Spirit"" is just O.K.","This concert is just O.K. for me. It is enjoyable but I already have a couple of songs on ""Greatest Irish Artists Gaelforce"". I prefer ""Absolutely Irish"" or my favorite ""Ragus"". dBahr"
2,tastes foul,"I couldn't do it. I tried. This stuff tastes so nasty that I had to switch to taking fish oil in pill form. If you don't want to burp up fishy lemon all day, don't buy this."
5,Definately Recommended,"I ordered this item after reading the other reviews on it and I am glad I did, there is no fishy after taste like others and no burping them up afterwards :)"
5,great taste,this is the second carlson norwegian cod liver oil i bought. absolutely love the taste. will buy again and again.
5,Great price and taste,"Great price, esp shipping, and it tastes like Lemon oil, though you better like lemons cuz you'll be burping it back up later, which isn't too bad for me."
3,COD LIVER OIL-IMPORTANT FACTS,"Important facts regarding Cod Liver Oil:Though CLO is beneficial in many ways for many of us the Omega-3 fatty acids are not entirely beneficial. According to a 2000 position statement issued by the Food and Drug Administration, consumption of over 3 grams per day can lead to an increased risk of bleeding. Very high doses of omega-3 fatty acids can lead to hemorrhagic stroke. Additionally, the FDA linked omega-3 fatty acids with worsening blood sugar control in diabetics and an increased risk of opportunistic bacterial infections. Omega-3 fatty acids may also lead to dangerous changes in heart rate in those with congestive heart failure or recurrent angina.Just FYI. :)"
3,"all fish, no lemon","it needs more lemon flavor!!! the oil is mild and goes down ok, but the aftertaste is fishy and can last all day..... so i chase it with a shot of pomegranate juice"
5,Norwegian Cod Liver Oil Lemon,I have been using this product for about a month now and I really like the taste and the benefits have been noticeable. My skin is clearer and glowing and also my hair feels thicker and shinier. I give the product 5 stars!
5,Great stuff,"Found this product from reading the Blaylock Wellness Report, also highly recommended reading. Great product, great company. Essential source of Omega-3's and Vitamin E. Tastes great when mixed with plain yogurt (Stoneyfield Farms). Highly recommended."
4,Yellow cap cod liver oil a bit misleading,"The picture of the cod liver oil shows a yellow cap which led me to believe this was the lemon flavored cod liver oil by Carlson. Instead what arrived was the ""Natural Flavor"" of cod liver oil (mmmmm fishy). The lemon flavor is easier for myself to ""put down"", however, I get a blast of ""real fish flavor"" with the naturally unflavored cod liver oil. Try to present the true product you will be shipping in the future."
5,Taste is just okay...,This oil goes down easily and leaves you feeling great on a daily basis- I definitely feel more lively using this stuff. The lemon flavor isn't as strong as I thought it would be-very subtle.
5,Good Deal,I was so happy to find this cod liver oil for such a low price. We are giving our little daughter alot of suppliments and its nice to save a good chunk of money anywhere we can. This cod liver oil tastes great in the lemon flavor you wouldnt even know its cod oil.
5,Carlson cod liver oil,Very pleasant tasting.(real lemon taste)No fishy aftertaste.I am very satisfied with this product.Would certainly recommend.
5,Very happy,I got this for my 1 year old child. He actually gets excited when he sees me filling the spoon up for him. He loves the stuff. I feel good knowing that he is getting his omega-3's.
5,Very easy to take,"If you have a hard time taking unflavored cod liver oil due to the taste, this is for you. I can't detect any bad flavor at all and it actually has a very pleasent lemon flavor."
4,GOOD I THINK,THIS STUFF IS VERY EASY TO DRINK. DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GOOD FOR YOU OR NOT.GUESS IT CAN'T HURT
2,A warning from my Dr,Yesterday I discussed taking cod liver oil with my intern and she advised me 'No Way 'It has too much vit A - Messes with blood clotting and has been proven to cause lung cancer -she also said NO to Vit E. Anyone else ever hear this ?Im going to research it .... Kt
3,Any Benefits?,"My only concern, I don't see any visible benefit. I mainly was trying to help myself with concentration, focus, memory, mild depression, mental clarity..."
5,Great product,I take it every day and it's not difficult to get down at all. Goes down quite smoothly. This is a product that I would like to take for a long time.
5,Great Product,"This product is the same that is offered in local health food stores, but at almost half the price. It is great to have it delivered straight to our door!"
3,vitamin A is added - not naturally present,I was very disappointed to learn that this carlson product had vitamin A added - so it's no better than taking a vitamin A supplement which defeats the purpose a little. i will say that the lemon flavor grows on you and my 19th month old daughter even asks for more.
5,It's good for what ails you.,"When my naturophatic doctor prescribed cod liver oil almost two years ago, I asked her what it was good for. She looked me straight in the eyes & in a dramatic voice replied, ""EVERYTHING!"" I've taken it every day since. I use one tablespoon a day (along with my ground flax seed) mixed up in a fruit or vegetable smoothie. The slight lemon flavor is compatible with either type. There is no fishy aftertaste either. I've tried a couple of less expensive brands. Both were awful. If you want to take cod liver oil (and you should want to!), get the best, and that's Carlson's."
4,Carlson Labs Norwegian Cod Liver Oil Lemon Flavor,"It seems to be a great provider of Omega 3 fatty acids. I bought it on the recommendation of my primary physician at Kaiser Permanente Panorama City, California, and a cousin of mine, a semi-retired osteopathic physician who has run a wellnessprogram in Northern California also uses it."
5,"Great stuff, great price",Was recommended by an acupuncturist - this brand specifically. Whole Foods is charging twice as much.
5,Noticable improvement in cognition within a few weeks,"I originally began taking this product for its purported effects on the brain. As a young guy in his twenties eating a paleo diet, I assumed that this product would have minimal effects, especially since I eat wild caught fish relatively often. Apparently I was mistaken! Within a few weeks (3-4) I noticed subtle improvements in my memory and mental clarity.When my first supply ran out I wanted to see if I could feel the loss of its' effects so I waited to buy my second bottle. I could feel myself return to normal; my brain ran slightly slower and I the mild brain fog seemed to return. Obviously I bought another bottle and have not been without it since!A note on taste - my first bottle was the ""natural"" flavor. As a fish lover it was bearable but my girlfriend found it unbearable (she likes fish, but not as much as me). The second bottle I ordered was ""lemon"" flavor. My girlfriend and I can both stomach it with no problem!"
4,"Taste good, and Hope my HDL number increases","I read many positive reviews about this and bought this after my friends recommendation on this product. It was more than 12$ cheap in amazon sold by Vitamin Shoppee, than the nearby Vitamin Shoppee store.So bought and having it daily, it taste good and im very hopeful with my HDL numbers."
5,Greatest fish oil - tastes great!,We've been using Carlson's Cod Liver oil for several months after a recommendation from a health expert. We have had good results in general health and have been surprised at how good it tastes! Highly recommend!
4,First taste? It's good!,"I just got my Carlson Norwegian Cod Liver Oil, lemon flavored. Figured I better get it in while I still had the stomach for it. And you know what, it tastes pretty good. I'm so glad, because I wanted to be sure to use this product for its health benefits. Remember to refrigerate it after opening, and take your spoonful in the morning. I only gave it 4 stars until I can post more about the perceived benefits. For now, taste!"
5,Awesome,"I have been taking Carlson lemon flavored Cod Liver Oil and Fish Oil for years. However, before Carlson's, I used to take fish oil capsules. After taking them, I would dread the imminent fish burps. The Carlson's lemon flavored Cod Liver Oil (and fish oil) actually have a lemony flavor. I do not know what dark magic they have used to take out the fishy flavor and put in lemon flavor, but I do not care. A few virgin sacrifices or slaughtered lambs are worth it. I can now take my fish oil without dreading what will come back up later. Now if I burp, I only get the pleasant taste of lemon.This is an oil so I do not recommend just spooning it into your mouth. It isn't bad, but it will be strange having an oil slick in your mouth. I put the cod liver oil in my protein shake. It gives my vanilla-flavored protein shake a flavor reminiscent of Fruit Loops."
4,500+ bones,"I purchased this item 5 days ago and overall I am happy with its performance. I am a second year triathlete, training for my first ironman. I am also an Oakley fanatic. Since the majority of my training is solo, an mp3 player comes in handy on those, I-really-don't-want-to-train-today, days. This is my second player; my first being a Creative Nomad. It is a hassle when my Nomad headphone wires come loose and start swinging everywhere. I don't have that problem with this product. Bottom line is that the Thump is the bomb...but so is the price. On long training runs and rides, I have music at my fingertips without those messy wires getting in the way. During overcast days, I simply flip the lenses up for better vision. I'm sure I look weird with the lenses up but that doesn't bother me to much. Right now all is right with the world and I love my new shades. However, I whish that the lenses were totally removable and the price was a whole lot lower. Gotta love those mad scientists!"
1,Bad Experience,"When I received this in the mail both plastic rods were broken. It did not come in a hard tube to prevent damage as it stated, but came in a cardboard box that had paper inside on both ends. Maybe it was just bad luck for me."
5,Mlesna Assorted Tea Bags - 24 bags - 12 flavors,"A great variety and nice tasting teas. The friend we sent these to raved about them, however, on my end it was very pricey. I never think a product you just add water to should be so expensive, but it was a last resort for us for a Cmas gift because Monastery Greetings was sold out. I would buy this product again if they get more realistic about pricing."
2,Tea bags,"This one pooped out as a result of my search in Amazon as a ""gourmet tea"".What a joke, waste of monies.. yak!"
3,Shrek and his language!,"i purchased this dolll for my daughter who was 2 at the time because she loves shrek. only problem i have is he says shut it donkey. now normally this would be o.k but when my daughter says ""shut it"" i have to pass some blame on this toy.)maybe some on her parents)"
3,Be careful if you need to contact ATI for warranty,"I bought two video cards which arrived new in a shrink wrapped box. One of the cards had a terrible flicker in it. Tried using it in a second computer, same thing. When I contacted ATI regarding the one year warranty, I was told twice (by their automated system) that the warranty had expired and would not be honored. Apparently the combination of the item number and serial number shows this item to be out of warranty on ATI's computer system and any warranty claim requires that you provide proof of purchase and an override on ATIs part. Just a hassle to go through and I haven't heard back from ATI for the last 10 days."
5,Great Price,"I purchased this card when my old card hit the dust. I couldn't beat the deal I found through Amazon. This is an upgrade to my 9600 Pro. I immediately noticed the difference. I can suddenly see a lot more detail in all of my games and they run just as fast if not faster. This card came out about two years ago as of my purchase, 8/08, so it's not a top of the line card, but for under $50.00 how can you go wrong. I definitely recommend this card."
3,ATI Radeon,"I'm salvaging every bit of life out of my outdated Dell computer. The ATI Radeon card I purchased allowed me to use higher resolution and play some decent games.The hardware arrived about a week after I ordered and paid for it. It was used but in good shape. It did not include any software or instructions. I had to find and download the drivers (not so simple because the card is no longer supported by the manufacturer). Once done, the card works just fine."
3,ATI X1300,"This is a good video car. But definitely not for the newest games. It does play World of warcraft pretty well on medium settings, you can also play in higher settings but then you start getting 5 or 6 FPS (frames per second)I would recommended if you are only going to play this kind of games (RPG) due to graphics tend to be not so demanding."
5,VERY HAPPY,"VERY HAPPY GREAT PRICE WHAT YOU IS WHAT YOU GET JUST MAKE SURE YOUR PC HAS AT LEAST A 300 WATT POWER SUPPLY,BIG IMPROVEMENT IN PERFORMANCE(HP PAVILLION)I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT"
1,your resposse is too late about the delived product with problem,I received the product from you. I'm disappointed with the delivered product. Because the crown of the watch is broken so I email the problem to you. But I can't receive your response now. What can I do to solve this problem? I want you to do your best for it. I'm still waiting for your quick reply.
1,Do not buy!!!,"The sound quality is so poor I cannot listen to this CD. No bass at all, and the stereo separation seems to be butchered. Totally awful. If I could have listened to this first, I would not have bought even if it sold for 10 cents. Beware"
3,"SIMILAR TO OTHER BOOKS I'VE READ, BUT MORE EXPENSIVE","For the most part, this book was pretty close to other, more comprehensive books that I've read on the topic of pizza preparation. I'm planning to open a restaurant and have been working on my dough recipes. I learned two things from this book...1)high gluten flour is a must and 2)high gluten flour is difficult to attain in small doses. The dough proofing guides and designs for a box are readily available on the internet. $12.95 for this book is a little much when all you really get are the normal ""how to make a pizza"" guidance and some of his recipes. It feels more like I bought a recipe book than a ""trade secrets"" book."
5,Great pizza the first try.,"Great book, I was able to create good pizza on the first try with Dominick help."
4,just right,"Easy --- understandable and quick to get you going... not something for someone who isnt a beginner, but then again I was :)"
2,Behind the times,"This book does have a lot of information and will explain the steps in making a good quality pizza. The steps of creating the crust are sound. However, the formulas are all for a single size pie and some of them sound very odd and unappetizing. In 1991 this volume was breaking new ground but since the publication of American Pie by Peter Reinhart there is no need for this book. Mine is going to the recycling pile."
4,Finally-the perfect crust!!!,Pizza is one of my families' favorite foods. Through the years I would occasionally make my own and was fairly happy with the results. I never was completely satisfied with the crust though. A recent trip to New York (and Ray's Original Pizza!) inspired me to try to recreate a New York pizza in my own California kitchen. I tried several different crust recipes but none really came out the way I wanted. After reading the great reviews here I decided to order this book. Well now I finaly have a crust I am happy with. It has that nice chewy texture that the pizza parlors have! I rate the content 5 stars but only rated the book 4 stars because it didn't have any color pictures. I love seeing pictures of the finished product in my cookbooks and this didn't have any. If you're looking for great homemade pizza though you will definately find it here!
5,BUY THIS BOOK! You won't regret it!,"This book ROCKS! It is straight to the point, easy to follow and once you get the hang of making the crust, it's simple. I've had the book for about a month and the very first pizza I made was great and they keep getting better! I would recommend this book to anyone who loves pizza and has a Kitchen Aid type stand mixer (unless you really like to knead by hand)."
3,"""A superb book for the amateur pizza chef""","I enjoyed this little book. There is a lot of good info between the pages. I do wish the author would have gone into more detail. The chapters on toppings and sauces were vague, perhaps even a little rushed. I also would have liked some information on larger quantity (commercial) pizza making. Another complaint: there was not a section in the back of the book for sources (e.g.-product and equipment suppliers). I have been fairly successful in making pizza, even though I haven't tried many of his suggestions. I am looking forward to trying some of his ideas, as it seems the author did his homework."
4,good but...,"This is a excellent book but it's a little confuse when the author try to compare the ""the art of making pizza"" with his career, have goods receipts, but i spect a book more american pizza style."
2,I cannot make the dough!,"This is my opinion: Save your money! I have made the dough four times with high gluten flour and all four times IT DID NOT WORK! I made it twice in the breadmachine, once by hand and nearly broke my wrists kneading it and once in a mixmaster with dough hooks. I followed the directions and put it in the refrigerator for up to 20 hours. When I tried to shape it into a pizza shape IT WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING! Last night I cut it into little pieces and used them as juggling balls. That's the only thing I could do with it.There are some good ideas in the book such as dough dressing, what type of cheese, sauce recipe and the homegenisation of the dough. But the dough process needs to be explained in more detail as I have followed the instructions TO THE LETTER and it DID NOT WORK! I have wasted my money on two bags of high gluten flour which cost over $3.50 each.I consider myself to be a good cook so I don't think it's me!..."
3,The art of Pizza Making,"The book explaing the art of making home pizza; however; did no like the recipes. I would use it as a reference book for pizza making. The book don't have pictures, it looks more like a pamphlet or a research paper then a book. I was expecting more from this book. For example problems and solutions with the dought or the ingredients. I think that it is overpriced."
1,Waste of Money,This book was simply about the authors sabbatical that she took after her horrible divorce from her Russian Jewish husband.I cannot believe a tree was cut down to publish such grammatical ranting. The book is written as if she was writing her thesis for a masters class and goes on about the friends she made while studying at a Chabad in Montreal. By reading it you can immediately realize that she is embellishing on some of the experiences.She raves about her feminism under control while in the Lubavitch community. Don't waste your money on this book.
1,Load of Garbage,"This book was HORRIBLE! From premise to conclusion this book really had no firm ground to stand on. What a futile exercise in intellectualism!! Look elsewhere to read about the Chabad Lubavitch sect, such as the Rebbe's Army..."
4,Lubavitch as Hippies,"I have always thought of the Lubavitch as the ""Hippies"" of the Hasidic movement, since they are viewed as way left by absolutely all of their Hasidic neighbors (some sects won't even talk to these ""infidels"", and in my observation have drawn lots of secular lefties from around the world. I'm not a Lubavitch but love em! Kinder, wiser, less judgemental people you cannot find -- the way they love G-d is admirable by all who have had a less than ideal religious background."
1,terrible,"This company makes terrible videos. I bought the whole Grimm series and they are a terrible production that is not even true to the beautiful, memorable classics. dont be fooled."
4,Great port of a great game!!,"It's a great game, and although it is a great port, it never is quite as good as if it was made explicitly for the system."
4,Beautiful !,"Wow, this neon lisence plate frame is beautiful, I love the way its phosforous glow looks on the car, durable -weather resistant hard plastic, though i prefer LED on some type of lights, it wouldnt look as good as this one, I am so happy with it and i love to turn heads as i drive down the block. I highly recommend it."
5,"Insightful, provocative !","This writer goes smack to the heart of the problem that both the Palestinians and Israelis face, namely terrorism. Loaded with dates and facts and quotes from high level participants, I will never trust a road map again. Not anybody's. this read was an adventure."
1,Demented warmongering,"Ill-researched, dogmatic and demented - classic warmongering, in which religion plays its usual reactionary role. For example, US tele-evangelist Jim Robison opened a Republican National Convention by saying, ""There will be no peace until Jesus comes. Any preaching of peace prior to this return is heresy. It is against the word of God. It is anti-Christ."" This is a mirror-image of bin Laden's rhetoric."
1,Not at all what I expected,"I expected this book to demonstrate how current events and biblical prophecy compare, to make predictions, etc. However, of the roughly 100 bible quotes only a couple are from Revelations of other prophecy books. Instead the book was one long tirate attacking Islam and Muslims. In fact, the author on several occassions explicitly demonstrates his hatred when he refers to Muslims as a whole as 'demons' or when he refers to soldiers in the 7 day was as terrorists. Such a shame"
1,Must Read for the Delusional Sci-Fi Fan / Paranoid Lunatic!!,"Yes, this is a fantastic book and a great read - if you are a delusional science-fiction fan or a paranoid lunatic! To anyone else it is obvious that this book is the product either of a severely emotionally troubled mind or of the best sci-fi writer since Isaac Asimov, or both!!! If you take it seriously, its premise that the words in a 2000 year old book is somehow 'prophecy' is just laughable. Apparently some people (like some of the reviewers here) do not believe in free-will, because you cannot have free-will and control your destiny, if you believe in 'prophecy'. If you believe that the bible can predict the future, then definitely get this book. It will validate your own paranoid delusions about the world. Also the writer is so smart and knowledgeable (as some have noted), and so he must be right - LOL."
1,"""Beyond Iraq-The Next Move"" is a vain hope","This book is typical of the shallow self-centered Christianity today. The first part of the book has no depth, but outlines an extremely basic understanding of Israel in the last days. The second half of the book is nothing more than a vain hope that it will not happen in the author's lifetime. The goal of so many prayer warriors is typical of last day ""Christians"" that are lovers of self, rather than lovers of God. In short, this book is worthless. Find something that will challenge you about the message of the cross. I recommend Hating for Jesus, (John 12:25) by Timothy Williams - if you can stomach the true message of the cross."
2,What the Hay?,"maybe we should just let the stuff in Isreal just play out, winner takes all...it would be a good idea if the land where nothing grows, fell into the Mediterranean. Bushes must love this here book, but the educated will continue to be shaking their heads."
5,Double minded,"Regarding the gentlemen from Greece that stated Mr. Evans supported Islamic views, I suggest he reread the paragraph in the American Prophecies. Mr. Evans was not endorsing Islam."
5,Every Christian Should Read This Book!,"With recent events in Iraq and now with the Middle East, this book is a wake-up call to Christians everywhere. This book helped me understand the implications of today's events from the perspective of Biblical truths. If you are a believer, you should read what this book has to say. It is GREAT! I could not put it down!"
1,Delusional,"The author of this piece of literary trash, and those who buy into his theories of Islam as a demonic religion must have some serious brain damage. For those misguided souls who believe this BS, I suggest you read what the book of Islam, the Quran, has to say. Why would you listen to anyone else to tell you what to think? are you that mindless that someone can control the way you view the world based on heresay and 'theories' based on hate and self-interest???"
5,Great Movie! Great Service!,"I received the movie, MEGAFAULT promptly about one week after I ordered it from Amazon. The dvd was in great shape even though it was a pre-viewed copy. I love action movies & this one really grabbed me right away. I've always been a fan of the late Britanny Murphy and this role for her was awesome! Her personality shown through and the part was much more physically rigorous, but she did great. Also she played the part of an extremely intelligent and caring person, which I enjoyed a lot. I gave this a 5 star rating, because that was as high as it would go, but I would highly recommend both the movie itself and ordering from Amazon! I have ordered both movies and books from them before and have been extremely pleased with the products and the service! Their products are very affordable as well!"
2,good premise but lacking in the story department,Sadly not much to recommend. Story is weak as is the characterizations. Neither Brittney Murphy nor Eriq Lasalle can resurrect this plot.
3,entertaining,It isn't the greatest movie I have seen but it is entertaining. The main reason I bought it is because Brittany Murphy starred in it. I would never have classified her as a great movie star but there is just something about her that draws my attention. I think it must be her personality that comes through.
5,It'll be your MEGAFAULT for not watching this screen gem!,"Exceptionally cast and probably hands-down the most accurately portrayed disaster movie yet. A real nail-biter from the opening credits till the end. It's a story of the triumph of hope and love over despair and disaster. I wouldn't be surprised if this movie isn't listed as a must-watch in film school for emerging filmmakers. An excellent example of the study of human condition. I cried full tears at the end (I won't spoil anything, but it's very touching). I also did a Costco run and loaded up on provisions... just in case! BRAVO! My only criticism is in a couple shots the CGI didn't look completely realistic."
1,cheap movie,Unprofessional actors and actress. I meant they have no feeling. Absolutely one star. Cheap graphic. Think twice before getting one.
1,Hilarious,"This movie was hilarious. My husband and I had a great time making fun of the absolutely horrible special effects (reminiscent of the old Power Ranger shows). The acting was so bad it was funny but truly, the special effects were what truly made the movie entertaining. It's only worth watching if you have a warped sense of humor like we do. It was seriously so bad it was funny."
3,Just Missed it's Mark...,"Megafault just misses as a sci-fi classic. Great concept! Awesome acting done by big names who really want to stretch their Hollywood-homogonized wings. Murphy and La Salle will probably be on board for the sequel...but really watch for the RV scene, where the driver, I think his name is Gil, runs with the script in his pocket. That will be a Trivial Pursuit question...you're welcome."
2,WHOSE FAULT IS IT?,"Brittany Murphy's tragic death may have interrupted a talented actress' bright future but this megabomb certainly isn't a high point. Badly miscast as a seismologist (??) and saddled with a horrible script, Murphy sleepwalks through this film surrounded by shoddy effects and shameful performances from co-stars Eriq Lasalle, Bruce Davison and Paul Logan. SyFy should leave disaster movies alone if this is the best they can do (although it's better than 2012 SUPERNOVA)."
2,Bait and Switch - Item not new as advertised,"On Nov 17, 2010 I ordered this DVD. Amazon listed the product as in stock and as the delivery date neared I received an e-mail saying it will be delayed for a couple of weeks. As the new date neared I received another e-mail saying that the DVD was not in stock and if I wanted to cancel I could. I didn't and finally today, 27 Jan I received not a new DVD but a repackaged, scratched, disc. To be fair I have not played the disc yet so I don't know if the playability has suffered or not. Bottom line Amazon advertised a new product and I received a used and damaged product after waiting over two months for the product Amazon claimed was in stock. The two stars are not for Doctor Who story but for Amazon failing on this.UPDATE - I spoke to an Amazon representative via the live chat and bottom line, too bad, return it. Very bad business practices in this case!!!"
3,"Good, But Very Overrated","This story has to be the most overrated in the history of the program. The reason why is because it is just another one of those Tom Baker stories, much like The Ark In Space, now also available on DVD, that everyone remembers because they've seen it countless times on PBS. The pacing is slow, the setting and the characters are very bland, even the Doctor has little of his usual charm. This story even somehow managed to find its way into the all-time top ten(!), when there are at least 50 stories that are much better than this one. There are some good elements, the robots are creepy and Leela is in it, but that's about all it has going for it. It is amazing how much nastalgia can influence people's opinions. If you want some real Doctor Who classics on DVD, get The Five Doctors, Tomb of the Cybermen, or The Caves of Androzani."
3,"Great Transfer, poor commentary track","This was one of the 1st DW's I ever saw as a child in the 1980's, and watching it on DVD was even better. Really enjoyed listening to the Opening and Closing narration from the extra features section. But the commentary track was awful, they hardly talked and you could tell that they did not come prepared to do this audio track (The 5 Doctors commentary track is the best!). It was wonderfull to see Tom Baker (Teeth and Curls?)in all his glory. Looking forward to more!"
5,Great songs and wonderful singer,Mark Owen is the consummate singer/song writer which all should enjoy not just the die hard fans. His style is eclectic but beautiful.
3,"Average regency,","I suppose that the book could warrant 3.5 stars, but if I'm following the amazon rating system, I'll have to give a three for 'I liked it'.That was all it was really, a 'likable' book, just above average. It didn't deliver all that its promising premise promised (tongue twister?) and while there were no obvious faults in the two leads, (too perfect?) I didn't feel very much drawn in to their stories, their backgrounds, or the plot. In fact, I think I started to like the Hero's father more than the hero himself, and this was strange as we only started to meet him towards the very end of the book.In fact, if I start thinking too hard about it, I'm pretty sure I'd be disappointed with the book because it failed to deliver.Still, it was a good enough (short!) read over dinner."
3,Boo!,"Well, I have just been playing the game myself. It's not too bad, it beats being bored. I'd say it would be more suitable for younger kids, apart from the fact that you see dinosaurs ripping sheep and cows apart! The game can be quite fun at times, when you decide to trash your park by letting a few really stressed Spinosaurus go mad in the park! Quite entertaining to watch! :D The fact that you only get 9 dinosaurs does suck, and there aren't many buildings and things. I'd say Theme Park is probably better, and more fun! (and cheaper! :D)"
4,good for a bit,this game is really good for a bit but after a few months it gets more and more boing . the idea of it is to make a park full of dinosaurs and stop the visitors getting ripped to shreads( thoutgh that is half the fun) this game has a downside which is that you can get 3 dig sights out of 9 so you to amke a new game to get different dinosaurs L1 up L1 down L1 gets you 10'000 dolars. id buy this game if you like jarrasic park and if you dont just rent
5,The Best JP Game Yet!!,"When I got this game, I read all about the features and the dinosaurs, so I knew pretty much everything......or so I thought. This game let's you hunt dinosaurs, you build your own Jurassic park, and add 25+ types of dinos in. The graphics are great, but the people aren't the best. You get certain dig sites to get dinos from. To figure out wich dino you want, look in the back of the book. The game is so addicting, I've been on it for hours at a time. This is the ultimate JP game yet."
3,Just OK,"My son (8) was VERY insistent that he had to have this game, that it was THE game on his wishlist for the holidays. Well, it has been far overshadowed by Lego Batman and Lego Indiana Jones...and this even though he is a dino-freak.I have played with this game too for awhile and after playing the Zootycoon Complete collection, there isnt that much that is new or thrilling here. And this game was expensive, far more so than I would have normally paid for an old realease - but the kid was really insistent.My advice, don't let your kid goad you into getting this, you'll both be dissappointed."
2,not worth the money,"its aa GG dont get me wrong but for 30 dollars that a Major Laugh. i was pretty much falling asleep while playing it. its like pokemon, a GG, but you can play it with one hand and just dose off and still win. if you can find it for 3 dollars knock yourself out but for 30 dont me laugh"
4,Fecal matter part-2,"im writing this on my PSP so excuse spelling. enyhoo, I had to point this out: theres a glitch on the PC version of this game that when a T-Rex takes a dump a few rapters will hop on over and start munching on it! that`s right, Dinos eating Crap! NOTE: this only works on Site-B mode and not on PS2 or Xbox. Sorry!"
1,Be Aware!,"Be aware when buying PSII games! The ones with the purplish blue backside do not work on all systems and unless you are very lucky, the stores won't take them back and Sony will do nothing to compensate you for your loss. They will offer to ""fix"" your playstation (that isn't broken) by adding some chip in it i am sure, for 75.00! If you have a Playstation bought 2 years ago or so, be aware!"
1,I cant even play it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,OK A lot of peopl ear ecomplaining about how the game sucks & how the game is terrible... but I cant even do that..Why????Because it wont even play on my playstation!! Yeah... I thought when i bought it the first time it was scratched or something... but i bought it again & again.. .& it still doesnt work... Not till i went to an actual store did i find the problem.The clerk told me the BLLUE discs used ror some playstation games dont work on older playstation 2's! I take really good care of mine so i dont have to buy new consoles every few years.. but cmon...I cant even play the game to see how bad it is... thats lame.
4,Jurassic Park Operation Genesis,this game rocks i havent got it yet but it looks so awsomei cant get the demo to work but ile get the game sooni reconment this game to any one who likes jurassic park and the rollercoaster tycoon series. Give a review if u really like this gameright on!
4,THE BEST,"FUN, I think because you can make your own park I have it for PC but it doesn't work well, who cares PS2 version is cool in JPOG you make a park, do missions, site B and Tutorials. I'm so into the Game I make my own designs like visitor/admin. in a enclosure and have dinos on the outside it's queit conveinient because u don't waste all ur buildings or fences just paths but, you have to make it big (the enclosure) or u'll run out of room to put stuff like the safari ride and balloon ride and the dinos won't go on rampage because lack of room, water, plants and need to hunt that's anoter pro cons for this design none except lack of room for guests but who cares they don't go on rampage and destroy ur park (fehw) but another con is u have to research heavy fencing and visitor shelter before u make ur dinos like T-Rex and spino."
2,Its OK after a little editing,"First off, this game has NO replay value, is not hard at all and the Dinosaurs are tame as a dog. I myself have never had an unintentional breakout, the Dinosaurs tend to drop into a Coma before trying to break out. The Site B mode gets old twice as fast as the normal Park Builder mode. There are sites out there with guides on how to make all the Dinosaurs available, and then make it possible to make hundreds of Dinosaurs, I've even made it possible to have 300 fossil teams. In theory you can edit the game to make Dinosaurs more aggressive. The other downside, no flying Dinosaurs and Dinosaurs cannot reproduce (Which is a huge downside in Site B mode). The in-game messages boarder on Game Spam, and when visitors leave your park unhappy, you get a message that says they left, and for what reason, but not how to fix it.In short, this game would have been better with some more work on the part of the Developers, the visuals are excellent, but the gameplay fell short."
5,BEST GAME I EVER PLAYED !,"This game is awesome! I don't know how people can hate it. One of the only reasons there were bad reviews is they can't play the game since it has a blue disc. They said ""You'll be lucky if it works on your PS2. The truth is you will be unlucky if it doesn't work.I think this is the best game ever because you get to build a park then play in it. You can fly the helicopter and drive a car if you download safari. To download safari go to maneger and then go to research finaly go to attractions and download safari.The best part is Saving up for dinosaurs. The game randamly picks a group of two dinosaurs. There different every time you play. To get more dinosaurs you need to download dino DNA. Go to maneger and you'll know the rest when you get there. I recomend you bye this game."
4,GOOD USE OF A MOVIE LICENSE,So far I have been playing the game for about a week. The feel of the movie is thereBeing able to control the parks functions is good. Deciding what Dino.to put in the parkWhat type of fences to put up for what Dino.what type of buildings ect.You get goodFeed back from both park crew and visitor about what you are doing. With all of the simsGames out there this is hardly the first to do this. But if you saw the movie there are a lot ofReferences to it including the cast from the movie except there voices.So if like this typeof game (sims games) then you are going to spent hours on it.I know I did.
3,Swann SW-P-HGA Wireless Network Booster,"Unit boosted signal strength when attached to my network card, but failed to boost when attached directly to wireless sending unit, and actually produced reduced signal. Did not meet up to expetations"
1,not needed at all,The antena is not at all helpful. it does not improve the range significantly. It may be helpfull when using one camera only as it improves when pointing directly to the camera but still not imroving the reception noticably.
1,SWANN DIVE,"Told by Swann Tech Support that their 2.4 Ghz wireless camera inside an average house would need a booster antenae to eliminate the interference. Bought this antenae and still got interference, so I called tech support and was then told their wireless camera system is not labeled correctly and it is unsuitable for use inside or in an urban area, because it gets interference from cell phones, microwaves, wireless phones and cable television. Swann tech support lied about needing this device, and it did not help at all to avoid interference or get a better image."
2,network booster,Money wasted. I don't see where this helps at all. Reception isn't any better with or without it.
1,Disappoint,"We still unable to installon the roof the antenna because looks like need to conect a receiver, and I can't find on your site, and the antenna doesn't come with any instruction.Can you help us with that?"
2,Doesn't fit very well,"I was disappointed that even after washing this bumper still doesn't fit well. Even with the ties tightened, areas still sag and gap in places. I should have taken it back."
2,Very flimsy...,"I bought this bumper because it was hard to find a plain colored bumper anywhere. It's so flimsy, not worth 24 bucks, that's for sure. I used it for awhile, but soon found another bumper that is much thicker and works much better. My daughter's feet would still stick out of the crib with this thing. I suggest you continue your search and don't waste your money on this bumper."
1,Eeeek...This bumper is not so good.,"As another reviewer said, this bumper is very flimsy and sags all over. Every time I put the rail down to put baby in the crib I would have to try to re-smooth the front side of it and eventually all the sides started sagging as well. My baby is a somewhat wild sleeper and her feet would get stuck in the slats under the bumper. The final straw was when I walked in to her room one morning and the bumper had more or less sagged down on to her face. I took it off the crib and returned it that day."
3,Doesn't fit at all,"It is impossible to find solid colors for bumpers. Even though I had read the reviews about these bumpers not fitting, I bought it anyway. I needed a darker color yellow,but there is little variety for solids. I put it on the crib and of course it wasn't a perfect fit. It will have to work."
5,I love this book more than any other book i've ever read.,I ABSOULTY LOVED THE BOOK! I WISH THAT I COULD JUST START ALL OVER ON IT! IT WAS GREAT!!
5,A Real Legend In Country Music,"I cannot say enough about this book,George is my all time favorite and the book says it all.How George got started and how he kept on going even after the death of his daughter,it had to be so hard for this man to sing some of the songs he does,George to me is real country and I am so glad I purchased this book."
2,Misbegotten Memoirs should be FORGOT ABOUT THE MEMORIES!,"I always have loved Wayland Flowers and Madame, and loved the show Madame's Place and I loved Wayland and Madame at their live shows. I Hate that Wayland has passed away, but last year, when I heard that Madame has been resurrected and a new person was chosen by Wayland Flowers agent or executor....anyway, I started looking for Madame stuff again. I found this book at a very good price and ordered it, thinking that it would be some enjoyable reading...Well, I am very disappointed with this one! I can't get through a chapter without wanting to put it down and go to sleep. It is extremely boring! Don't waste your time.The pictures in it are kind of cute, but it isn't worth buying!"
4,Madame tells all!,"Wayland Flowers fans will love this in-depth story of Madame's life. Be advised, if you're not a hard-core fan, this will most definitely not be the book for you."
4,An excellent buy for experienced users,"The book provides insights regarding everyday functions, which you didn't know. The author explains each step thoroughly, however nothing can replace the knowledge you gain by trying it yourself. Nevertheless, its a very interesting book that helps you gain more solid knowledge about almost every formula in excel which you are already using or interested about."
4,i only know 1 song,"i've never heard the whole album, but i know that ""i lust 4 u"" was featured on the House Party 2 soundtrack, now that song is actually pretty damn good for someone i've never heard of, but when i heard it in the movie it was really catchy, good job"
3,not like the real thing,I thought this was going to light up like a glow worm is supposed to and it doesn't. Oh well.
3,John Pertwee in the Shower???!,"Yes. Hardly Doctor Who when John Pertwee is wearing a frilly shower cap and singing in the shower. This story wasn't as good as I expected. Shop window dummies coming to life is a good idea but the story didn't live up to much. Too much talk and not enough action. Liz Shaw is introduced but she isn't very 'scientific looking' if you know what I mean! There are some good parts though with some great effects. It's hilarious when John pertwee lights a fuse and says, ""stand well back"" and a feeble 'pop' is heard! However, the dummies make up for the boring bit's!"
4,"The first Jon Pertwee episode, no epic but worthy","In this 4 part episode Jon Pertwee is introduced as the third Doctor.This story is quiet average, like most introduction episodes. The first 3 parts are rather boring, except for the excellent Pertwee-humor, part 4 gains some tension and the typical Who atmosphere."
3,Spearhead From Space is a good start for the Pertwee era.,"Spearhead From Space is not only the first story to feature Jon Pertwee in the lead role, but is the first Doctor Who story to be fillmed in color. After recovering from a forced regeneration, The Doctor reluctantly joins forces with Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart and UNIT in order to stop an evil alien life form knowen as the Nestene, who are bent colonizing Earth and elemnating the human race. The Nestenes plan of attack is to create replics of high goverment officials, as well is an army of killer mannequines called Autons. Although Spearheard From Space start out a bit slowly it show promise of what is yet to come from Jon Pertwee's protrayal of The Doctor."
1,junk,well i have about given up on getting decent products anymore/this one is from taiwan .right when i took out of packaging stem was very loose with fully extracted.took air pressure with guages that i know are accurate/4 lbs off.i want it to be accurate.so good luck on purchasing anything now!
2,What Happened to the Conclusion??,"I am so Shocked by the ending of the book. I was reading along assuming the good guys were about to crash in and save the day, but they did not. The book ended abuptly as if the writer just took a coffee break and walked off the job! I usually like Robin Cook's books. He gives you something to think about, even if that leaves you shaken or paranoid. I could have accepted it as a fair read but the ending was so disappointing. The book was not as gripping nor were the lead characters endearing so this ending is an even greater slap in the face. Shame on you Robin Cook!"
1,Shockingly bad !,"This is quite possibly the worst book that I've ever read. The dialogue is 1930's English schoolgirl stuff--eg. ""my word"" said bt a grown, educated woman in her 20's, plus many other equally inane phrases. The story involves crooked doctors at a private clinic cloning babies from donor ovaries, sometimes harvested illegally--eeugh!! I have another book by Robin Cook, waiting to be read-""Yector"". I can only hooe that Dr. Cook was having a few bad days when he wrote ""Shock""."
2,forgot to write ending,I just finished reading this book & what the other readers wrote about it & they were so right. the book is slow & boring & it wasn't finished. What happened to the women. What happened to the bad guys. I sure don't know. And after reading what the other readers wrote I don't think they know either.I have all of Robin Cook's book and the ones I have read were good but this one isn't up to par.
2,"OK story, terrible ending.","I like most of his books. But with this one I was disappointed. I had to go to four bookstores to find this and so I hoped it would be outstanding. I was wrong.It had an good beginning, then it got worse. The ending was just bad. It wouldn't have been so bad if there had been any closure, but it just ends. The epilogue should have been the last chapter. Then he should have written an epilogue to explain how it all went down."
1,Shocked that it sells!,"You know, Robin Cook could do better. I'm glad I only borrowed this book instead of buying it. Every book he writes is so far fetched, but this one made me come to this site, to see if I was missing pages at the ending! Stupid story of supposedly intelligent women. Sure they get hired as another identity. Sure they sneak into the computer files. Really a waste of reading time."
1,Where Did Robin Cook Go?,"I just cannot believe that Mr. Cook was the author of this ""novel."" The storyline was trite, the characters were one-dimensional, and the dialog was insipid. I kept reading, hoping the plot would improve. Instead, I got to the end and looked to see if pages had been inadvertantly torn from the book....The story just STOPPED, with no resolution. It is now a joke in our house. When we want to stop doing something, we say ""It's time to move this operation offshore!"" Please Mr. Cook, try harder next time!!"
2,Yawn,"Well, Robin Cook is one of my favorite writers, but this book honestly bored me to death. I thought the plot was a little bit intriguing and had some potential, but the boring dialogue between the two women began to get very very annoying. There was no very shocking ending, and was kind of disappointed in the plot content after his last book, which although very bizarre was a very fun read."
1,Worst ever,Boriig story. Characters you want to gar rid of. Infantile plot.Horrible ending. Worst Cook book ever. i doubt if I will ever waste money on one of hid again.
1,The worst book I read in years,"I don't normally read Robin Cook, but based on this reading, I can say I don't plan to touch his work ever. Anything with regards to computers and security made me cringe to think about. Stereotypes abounded, from ""computer nerds"" to giggly women to ex-military. Meh. An embarrassment overall: avoid."
3,Not one of my favorites...,I am a huge fan of Robin Cook's books and have personally read many of them. This book was ok but it did start to drag on. I also had a hard time connecting with the characters. About 2/3's way through I read the last chapter. I was so disappointed by the ending that I never finished the book.I'm planning to read his books from the first to the last over the summer so I will definitely try to give this one another chance.Shock
1,Very disappointing,"Having always enjoyed Robin Cook's books, I was ""shocked"" and very disappointed with his latest. If on any bestseller list it will be solely because it WAS written by Robin Cook and certainly not due to it's own merit. The characters are shallow and their relationships are unbelievable. While the topic seems to be taken from today's newpaper headlines, the story itself is just not up to it. Unfortunately, after a book like this, readers may distrust the next book a writer publishes.....even if that writer is Robin Cook."
2,The only SHOCK was that this was written by Robin Cook,"I bought this book with plans to have the author autograph it when he is in town this month; I don't think I'll bother now. What a disappointment. The two females reminded me of Laverne and Shirley. Though the subject matter was as controversial as in Cook's other novels, the handling of it-- the development of the plot was very sketchy. There was no suspense, even at the end. Hope there are no plans for a ""Made for TV movie."" I also wish I had waited to get the book at the library!"
1,I cannot believe this book ever got printed,"Facile, predictable and badly written. This possibly the worst book I have ever read. A poorly educated teenager with a medical dictionary could have done a better job."
2,Shock,I have read all of Robin Cook's books. Shock was a big disappointment. The characters were unbelievable and shallow. The plot was predictable and the ending was insulting to the reader. Maybe Mr. cook has lost his magic.
1,A new low for Robin Cook,"I've read most of Robin Cook's earlier novels and enjoyed them immensely, despite his tendency to send protagonists on foolish, ""Nancy Drew""-style amateur investigations. This one, sadly, is far below Cook's usual standard. If a lesser-known writer had produced this, it would never have been published."
2,Ufff..,"I was actually able to finish this book. I had couple of times put it down and couple of times I had found myself thinking about throwing it away, fortunatelly I was in the bus full of people and I just didn't wanted to look like an idiot. So I kept it and finished this book.Well what to say. It could be very good book, because idea was great. But how can someone actually screw up such a great idea with such a poor writing... I don't know.Robin Cook? Are you reading this reviews? Please next time, TRY to do a better job, other books of yours were much better."
2,did Cook really write this book,"I own and have read every one of Robin Cook's books, some several times. They are riveting, exciting and well written.With Shock, I was in shock. Here are two female post grads from Harvard, no less, with newly acquired Doctorates in Economics and Microbiology. Then in comes Laverne & Shirley. How Cook expected to pass this off as a well written mystery beats me, the two girls giggled, argued, made a mockery out of average intelligence(to wit, the first and only day on the job, like no one noticed they took 1/2 hour breaks every hour, met at the water fountain and disappeared with no notice) and it was supposed to be a medical mystery. The only mystery is how he managed to keep a straight face as he wrote it. Would not recommend it at all. Unless you get it free or on loan, but remember, I told you so."
2,Could have been interesting,"I listened to the audio version of the book. It was more tolerable when played at high speed ... but still dragged. Lots of extraneous details, unbelievable plot line, technical errors (how do you run a password cracking program on a locked server, so that you can then log on??), ...and as others have mentioned the abrupt ending. I'd hoped for a lot more from this book!"
1,Written for children?,I expected more from Cook. He took an interesting and timely subject and wrote a superficial and implausible story. The two main characters (Harvard Ph.d candidates!) come across more like high school freshman in their dialogue and thought process. The other characters are poorly and thinly developed.Cook must have been as bored as I was because he didn't write an ending - only an epilogue - leaving the story incomplete and the reader feeling cheated. Save your money until he writes like he has in the past.
2,What happened?,"The plot of the book was okay, I had nothing else to do and it kept me busy for a few hours. But now that I've finished the book, I doubt it was worth it. What's the point of reading a book? To get to the end, right? This book has no end. It just stops. It reminds me of my elementary school stories where the teacher wrote at the end, ""You must add a conclusion."" The book was very disappointing. I gave it two stars because it might have been a mediocre boredom-buster, if only Cook had thought to add an ending."
1,A penny dreadful,"Such a combination! Medical expertise coupled with pedestrian writing that wouldn't do credit to a high school student. Cook must be basking on his laurels (or money)to feel he could get away with such poor writing. The plot is interesting, but his two main characters appear as airheads, in spite of their education. Dickens used lots of words, for he read out loud many of his books. Cook, on the other hand, uses lots of words with little impact."
1,Cook shocks his readers with unbelievable nonsense,"I have read all of Robin Cook's books. Unfortunately this was the worst. ZERO STARS. The setting and plot could have been a real winner, but was lost right from the start. I had a very difficult time reading the utter stupidity of the story as it unfolded. Not one to give up, I was rewarded by a rapid, injudicious, and totally dubious ending(???) thankfully terminating my misery. There is plenty more negative to say about the story, but I like the author too much for that. He owes his fans big time for this one."
2,It Ends But Has No Ending.....,"I came to this page to see how many pages the book normally has. Our copy has 370 pages, but we were both positive our copy was missing pages. It isn't. The words stop, but the book has no ending. I guess he got into the fix and then just didn't know where to go. I'm even more surprised that his editors let him leave it like this!"
2,Not Up To Speed,"I thought someone was using Robin Cook's name in publishing this book. It just didn't seem to be his words and wasn't as gripping as most of the other novels I have read. I kept looking to see if somebody else's name was on the book, but it seems that Robin Cook wrote it. I didn't care for the way it ended and felt the same about ""Abducted"". I hope he writes more books soon, but also hope they are better reading."
1,A Total Ripoff,"I don't know who actually wrote this book (I realize Robin Cook's name is on the cover), but whoever did should be ashamed of him or herself. As should Robin Cook for putting this piece of adolescent drivel on the market. He will reap millions because of his reputation, but believe me, this book does not compare with previous efforts in any respect. The dialogue is shallow and juvenile; the characters are one dimensional and, in the case of the men, embody the worst stereotypes. Would Harvard grad students act this way? Talk this way? I think not. The sad part is that the premise of the book has some merit. Too bad, Robin Cook has become so egocentric at this point in his career that he no longer feels any need to provide us, the readers, with a decently written story. This doesn't even deserve one star. For heaven's sake, read a borrowed copy. Don't spend money on this one!"
2,Eh,"This is the first book I have read by Robin Cook. It was a fun read, but kind of boring. The science and medical story behind it can be believable but it was truly odd. The story on the other hand was not all that believable in the slightest. It was a medical story gone pop. But this will not stop me from reading his other books."
1,quite unbelievable,"Awful in all aspects. I was so glad I read reviews after reading the book because I was beginning to think maybe something was wrong with me! All the comments about Nancy Drew, Lucy and Ethel and Laverne and Shirley (each generation has its own frame of reference) were all right on the mark. Perhaps Janet Evanovich really wrote it with medical info help from Robin Cook."
3,SLOW READING,THIS PARTICULAR BOOK BY AUTHOR IS MUCH SLOWER MOVING PLOT - NOT ASS SUSPENSFUL AS SOME OTHER BOOK TITLES BY AUTHOR.....CAN'T WIN THEM ALL -
2,forget robin cook,"My second e-book by Cook. Pity, I had to skip over last pages, too predictable. There were two candidates for good guys and once one name was mentioned, the story was over. To be continued? It looked that way.Before I decide to buy more Cook's books, I'll have to identify the stand-alone stories. The positive protagonists in this one (and the one about Pia) become quite annoying after a while.The medical info, however, may be bit educational although this particular book main story was in the news some ten years ago.It seems that Dr. Cook specializes in using current events to educate (OK) and entertain (not so much).Two stars are all I can give to this book."
1,The Shock Was I Paid Good Money for This,"The only thing I can say is don't waste your time with this book. The characters are unlikeable, the dialogue ridiculous, and as for the ending - or lack of - forget it. I am an OR nurse, and it is a good thing. The way Cook throws medical terms around without defining them would make this book even harder to read for the average lay person. What could have been a good book (the plot is a good one) was ruined by the aforementioned problems. The two main characters alternate between being women of purpose and absolute ninnies. I agree with another reviewer. Leave this on the library shelf, and don't even think of buying it."
1,Where is the ending?,"I like Robin Cook, but he must have been rushing to deadline on this one. It's a good premise, but you can only think these two, bright Harvard seniors must have lost their minds when they turn into typical, stupid women victims.The non-ending is only shocking because you wonder whether they just want you to buy the other half of the book next time or whether Cook contracted a serious illness mid-sentence."
1,shockingly horrible,"In the past, I have enjoyed many of Robin Cook's literary efforts. The only shock in this book was the quality of writing which was shockingly horrible. I will probably never buy another one of his novels. Did Robin Cook really write this?"
2,Where is the real Robin Cook??,"I have enjoyed most of Robin Cook's previous books. This does not include his last, Abduction, which was one of the worst books I have ever read, and definitely does not include this one! I'm not sure what has happened to the author (the same old picture on the back doesn't help convince me he's really still alive and writing!) but he has lost my attention. The dialogue was choppy and unbelievable, the characters were all flat, and I can only blame myself for finishing it. By the end, I really didn't care what happened, as long as it was over!"
1,Big Disappointment,"This is undoubtably Robin Cook's worst book. The jacket cover synopsis sounds pretty good but it goes downhill from there. The plot is never fully developed, the cloning processes are not explained in any detail and the ending is probably the worst of ANY book I have ever read. It just stops. There is nothing worthwhile about it. A total waste of money!"
1,I think Cook cooked his literary goose on this one !,"I normally love Robin Cook books but this one is so poorly plotted and so ""out there"" that even listening to it in the car on my commute was a chore. Hope his next novel brings back his great writing style."
1,Boring and farfetched,"This is my 5th Cook book in the last two years and I honestly have no recollection of the content, plot, etc of the first 4 and I guess this will follow right in line. I doubt I will read another unless it is the last paperbook in my TBR books and I am on a desert island, marooned for years. I really did not like the two female heroines and I thought they were crazy to think that the money they were paid for an egg was on the up and up. The ease in which they got jobs was pretty preposterous too.Oh, well, I guess Dr. Cook is laughing all the way to the bank just as Cornwell and a few others are."
3,Incredible,"This book in incredible, as in not credible. That two people with graduate degrees with their professional lives just starting would commit so many felonies without much contemplation whatsoever goes beyond suspending disbelief. I must confess that I was about to overlook it and put it down as a guilty pleasure because the plot does move along nicely, but then the ending blew any positive feelings I may have had about the book. Not recommended."
1,MAJOR Disappointment!,"I can't believe he bothered to write this and I can't believe his publisher bought it. The two main characters - supposedly women of high intelligence, would probably try and track down the person who bought a wig made of their donated hair to be sure it was properly styled. Track down an adopted child - perhaps; but, tracking down a donated egg?? PLU-EASE. Wish I had read the reviews before I made a purchase based on past laurels. We should all get double our money back - people buy Robin Cook because we have come to expect far better than we got this time. Shame on him!"
1,Shockingly bad,"This book is execrable. It's much more of a comedy/fantasy book than a thriller. Other reviews have the plot's inconsistencies accurately listed.The book suddenly stops as the heroines have been captured by the bad guys. Will they be killed? Escape? Sorry, Cook's deadline arrived and he stopped writing.The bad guys are about to helicopter away from their human cloning lab, with the US attorney and federal marshals at the gate. Do they really expect to set up a new facility in the Bahamas, having brought out only the information on their zip disks, with no problems resulting from what the marshals are about to discover?Don't fall for the 5 stars amazingly given by the #1 reviewer -- I suspect those folks post so many reviews they can't have read the books they review.Cook has decided to emulate Clancy by ripping off the reading public through lending his name to unprofessional writing -- but at least Clancy finishes his books!"
2,This robin's nest should be cooked.,"Shock was terribly terribly sad. What a waste of trees. I can't believe that there is a supposedly sequel to this story that went from bad to worse and ended terribly. This was my second Robin Cook misfire. I will not repeat this mistake again. I'm sure there are people who enjoy his books, but I am not one of them. What a waste of time and energy. I love to read and was therefore gravely disappointed. :("
1,Waste of time!!!,"Two characters were annoying, the writing was amateurish, and there was no ending.I have read most of Robin Cooks books. Unfortunately the standard has been getting worse.I dont think I will waste my time any more."
2,Mildly entertaining at best...,"If you are in a jail cell or stuck in an elevator you may want to read this. What started as a good storyline faded fast. The concept was intriguing, but frankly the finish was incredibly weak. Obviously, he was up against a deadline to finish. It is likely his worst work to date."
1,Just for the money?,"Robin Cook's literary skills have never included the ability to create believable characters but he has written some passable books (I've read them all). This was the first one that I just couldn't finish due to the absurd motivations and hackneyed personalizations of his heroines and villians. My honest impression of this book is that he just desperately needed some money so he just churned out something to get it. Generally I would rate Robin Cook's works as six or a seven on a scale of one through ten however this book would not live up to a four rating. Don't waste you money, this book stinks!"
2,"Interesting theme, awkward writing","Robin Cook has a talent for choosing hot-button medical themes for his thrillers. In this case, two female students earn money by donating their eggs to a fertility clinic. Later, they get curious about the fate of those eggs. Did they produce children? When their inquiries meet a blank wall, they penetrate the clinic by applying for jobs there. Their nosiness uncovers a sinister side to the clinic's work, but inevitably gets them into serious trouble with their bosses. This could have been interesting if the dialogue were more credible. Unfortunately, all the characters speak in stilted voices. The two women, who are completing their doctorates, come across as Valley Girls. The clinic's lecherous head acts like a buffoon; his chief of security is a stereotypical fascist. All this diminishes the impact of what could have been a scary story."
3,"Pretty Good, but not is best work","This book was written as well as all his other books. I very much enjoyed reading it, it engulfs you quickly. The only bad thing I can say about it is that it was like watching a movie where the characters do exactly the opposite of what they should. That was frustrating, however also entertaining."
3,Not Robin Cook's Best,"Just finished SHOCK, a medical thriller by Robin Cook, the doctor turned novelist. I've enjoyed soem of his earlier books like COMA and TOXIN, but this one not nearly as good.A slow start and muddled plot about two Harvard graduate students who try to solve their financial problems by becoming egg donors at an exclusive private infertility clinic in Boston. Later curiosity about their donated eggs prompts them to get employment at the clinic and they discover some horrifying secrets.These two characters may be Harvard graduates but unfortunately act more like Laverne and Shirley. I don't find them very endearing.The book gets bogged down with too much medical detail in places. I wish the author would just get on with the story.Consider it worthy of only 3 stars. Just OK."
1,Schlock,"The only SHOCKing feature of this book is how this poor example of a medical mystery could have Robin Cook's name on the cover.After forcing myself to read this through to the end, I was more disappointed than I ever recall being with any of Cook's stories.Save your money - and your time."
3,Who really wrote this book?,"Being a big Robin Cook fan, I was very dissappointed in his latest book ""Shock"". Usually he is on the cutting edge of what is happening in medicine..not this time. The story is slow and it failed to make me care about the characters or their mission. Definitely wait for the paperback on this one."
1,Incredibly dull,"If I could give this zero stars I would. This book is like a medical/horror version of Scooby Doo. It's trite, predictable, and full of stilted dialogue. There is no ending to speak of. The entire premise of the plot is farfetched and the ensuing events are ridiculous at best. I only finished it because I hate not knowing what happened at the end--well, guess what, I don't know anyway because it just ENDS. You never really find out what happens. I don't even feel bad about giving the ending away, because this was so lame."
1,Schlock,"After reading Cook's last offering, ""Abduction"", and assuming it was just an isolated mistake, I am sorry to report that ""Shock"" is no improvement. The plot goes beyond Cook's usual unlikely-but-at-least-remotely-plausible-and-thus-scary realm and plummets into you-have-GOT-to-be-kidding-me territory with frightening speed. I found it impossible to take the characters seriously, as their behavior ranged from just plain silly to unbelievably irritating, and the dialog was simply inane. Having read and enjoyed (with the exception of this and ""Abduction"") the rest of Cook's novels, it is hard to believe this was written by the same man."
1,Nancy Drew Returns,"My being one of Robin Cooks biggest fans I eagerly awaited this new book "" Shock "". However, as I started the book and the further into I got I had to stop and keep turning the cover around to make sure I hadn't mistakenly laid it down and picked up an old Nancy Drew Mystery. This is what this book felt like to me. It was predictable and the writing wasn't geared toward an adult mystery reader. The ending was not worth the trouble I had getting through it. It left me wondering why hadn't I just given up on page 89. Hard to believe Robin Cook even wrote this. Sounded more like a very novice writer.I suggest to you to at least look at it if you are a Robin Cook fan as I am...who knows maybe I was having a bad day.That's it from Carole's Corner of the World"
4,Raises some good issues,"OK, so Robin Cook isn't the next literary genius, but he does know how to draw suspense in a way that doesn't let you put the book down. Shock was no exception, and along the way he managed (as usual) to bring up some really good issues. This time around, the issues were cloning, medical research, and reproductive treatments and Cook brings up some thought-provoking questions. How far is too far in medical research? What is respect for life and why does it matter? How does the exploitation of women fit in? All good questions that our society needs to answer, and kudos to Robin Cook for bringing them up in a winsome way."
1,Horrible,"I usually enjoy Robin Cook and have read all of his books. Some are better than others, but rarely a complete let down. This one, by far, is the absolute worse. I could get by with the characters accomplishing way too much, way too easy, but the ending was totally unacceptable. It's not even a good lead in to a sequel. It was as if while writing the last sentence, he just stopped. I listened to the tape first, and thought it was a mistake. I borrowed the book to verify the ending. It felt like I wasted good money for a book that was missing the last pages. It was just a complete disappointment."
1,Not Up to Cook's Usual Standard,"As a fan of Robin Cook since ""Coma"" I was surprised by this book. I've come to expect a lot of medical detail, seemingly unrelated vignettes all coming together mid-story, suspense, and edge-of-the-seat spine tingling scenes leading to a frenzied climax. This book on the other hand was quite flat. The characters and their actions were unbelieveable, their ethics questionable (breaking into a fertility clinic before there's any plausible reason to do so), and everything was cliched and predictable.Perhaps Dr. Cook has run out of steam, or thought he could dash off a novel without devoting his full attention to it, depending on his name to sell copies. He's doing himself harm, since he's put his readers on notice that they can't automatically expect a high quality thriller anymore when they see his name."
5,This book should be a movie,Many many years ago I was a member of author Ed Griffin's critique group and I had the opportunity to read chapters of this book that were still in progress. Now that I've had the chance to read the whole book I must say I was blown away. Strong characters in a hellish situation make this novel a memorable read. The story all about survival -- physical and mental survival. Translation: this story would make a GREAT movie. The premise is high concept and brings up a lot of questions when it comes to our current methods of incarceration.
5,"Adak.....Home of the ""Williwaw""....","I really enjoy ""prison"" books. This book was one of the very best that I've read!! It has a quick start and don't slow down at all.Frank Villa is the ""good guy"" and you know if there is a good guy, well, there has to be a ""bad guy""! So...Put 300+ prisoners on an island that was a former Navy base and see what happens!!You will NOT be bored with this one. I found myself thinking alot about this book when I wasn't reading. When I was shopping, when I was at work, etc. And now that I'm finished, I am sad. Sad that I can't go back to Adak. Ed Griffin does a GREAT job at making you feel the Williwaws right along with the prisoners!!Thank you Mr.Griffin for all the good work that you do!! It is people like you that make a difference!Thumbs AND toes up for this one!!!"
4,"If you liked ""Mama"" on GTA IV you're going to really like the album!","If you enjoyed the track ""Mama"" as featured in the the game Grand Theft Auto IV, then you're really going to enjoy this album. To call this a ""Russian rap album"" is not doing it justice. Beyond the hard-hitting rhymes, Basta incorporates deep club-worthy beats, an eclectic selection musical accompaniments ranging from orchestral strings to Bossa Nova-style guitar riffs, great use of blues and jazz samples, and a female background vocalist who adds a haunting layer of musical maturity and complexity to this compilation. You don't need to speak a word of Russian to enjoy this album!"
4,I don't know why Darkrai is on the title,"This movies isn't about Darkrai, it's about Palkia and Dialga. I wish they had spent more time developing the history of the animosity between Palkia and Dialga. That would've been more interesting. Better yet, I wish this movie was actually about Darkrai, because Darkrai is a more interesting Pokemon than either Palkia or Dialga. Still, this movie is better than many of the previous Pokemon movies. At least it has some really powerful Pokemon going at it. Hopefully the next movie (Arceus and the Jewel of Life) will be good, because the one after that (Phantom Ruler: Zoroark) is supposedly pretty bad."
2,Umm Voices??,"Movie was awsome,trully beautiful visuals and music, however honestly PUSA who do you think your fooling with the horrible voice acting, trying to make them sound alike...Foreshame...thank you for the japanese version i purchased i no longer have to see a cheap immitation."
4,A Pretty Good Pokemon Movie,"Great animation, the plot moves a good pace that keeps the action coming, and almost every character and creature that appears helps out and make themselves useful. Too bad it has a lousy dub's (as usual)"
3,Movie is fun...but no extras whatsoever.,"I was disappointed with the DVD (I have bought every pokemon movie so far for my 8-year old son)Usually, this dvds come loaded with extras, as short movies, more content, etc. but in this case ONLY THE MOVIE...not even Japanese Language (I like the original voices)."
1,Didn't work,"The item description said it was used but in acceptable condition. That's accurate, if you consider a damaged case and anon-functional DVD to be acceptable..."
4,a cd lost at the time of release in a mess of great cd and terrible music trends,"i alway felt cuatro was their best cd but after 10 plus years i put this back in the stereo this cd at the time of release i thought was a bad cd but now looking back maybe it just slipped threw the cracks in my mind of music.this cd is damn good, may be with age i opened my mind more i always like their earlier thrash releases but cuatro was not typical thrash either.this is one solid heavy cd with some good clear production(the bass actually shines threw well)they spent the next ten year trying to recapture their thrash roots not so well but the next good release was dreams of death only a B+ in my veiw but this cd is refreshingly good songs well written and executed."
5,smokin' album,"Flo-Jet is one of the most unique thrash bands ever... and Drift may be thier best-ever effort( although Cuatro may be just as good). i saw them live twice on the tour supporting Drift, one of these shows was at a small club. you could really tell these guys were proud of the work they did on this album (Drift), and they really had something to be proud of!.... it was one of the best times i've ever had. This album does'nt have a bad note on it.... and i consider it one of my top 5 favorite albums ever... thrash on guys!"
4,Pretty Decent,"This is the only album I have by them and it is on cassette so it doesn't have the bonus tracks. I recently burned it to CD and have listened to it several times. It is more in line with what I like to listen to compared to the hair metal bands I've experienced lately.The playing is great and Erik AK has a unique voice that at times reminds me of James Hetfield and at other times, a singer I can't remember the name of (I guess that's a pretty vague statement!). After several listens I can actually remember bits and pieces of the music. I've heard a lot about this legendary band but in the past, I wasn't blown away by their music. In this case, I'm still not blown away, but they are a good band. I can't say how this compares to their classic album Doomsday For The Deceiver, but it is not bad.If you like advanced thrash, this is the band for you. Highly recommended."
3,Discipline Without Punishment,Great book for ideas and an overall plan however could not implement this completely in the company I currently work for's culture.
2,Woefully outdated and lacking.,"Outdated investing information is worse than no information at all. Don't take any 'data' in this book at face value.I was really disappointed in the small number of small investments in the book.I have a more 'holistic' investment perspective, but I know of a lot more small investments;Pay off high interest debt!!A shopping warehouse membership.A freezer.A 'cushion' in the checking account to keep any checks from bouncing. It can also reduce the fees for a double dividend!Regular maintenance of vehicles and major appliances.Energy efficient lights.Water heater blanket.Pre-pay phone cards.Continuing education classes.A consultaion with a Certified Financial Planner."
5,Step by step book on investing,This book explains you don't need thousands of dollars in the bank to start investing. You can start with as little as $50. The book tells you what you can invest in as your money grows.If you are a new investor or afraid to invest because you don't know where or what to do. This is a great book for you.
1,Received WRONG Book,"I never received the book I ordered. Instead I received a book titled ""How to Invest $50.00 to $5,000."" These books aren't even close to being similar. Then when I do report the mistake I find out that the book I ordered isn't even available. VERY DISAPPOINTING. I also took four or five emails for me to receive a Return Authorization number and procedure. It will be interesting to see if if and when I receive a credit for this mistake.Now sure I'll use Amazon again when ordering books..........."
3,It's okay....I guess.,"If I went by looks alone I would say this was a five star item. The color is very pleasing and the quality is great. However, I was hoping that the bumper would be a little wider to at least cover more of the crib bars' length. The bumper is also a little long so there will be some sag when you put it on. Since my son only uses his crib to sleep, I only needed the bumpers for cushioning him in case he rolled over into the sides of his crib while asleep. But I wouldn't recommend them for parents who have their children playing inside their crib."
5,Perfect color,We wanted to be surprised when the baby came so we do not know if it is a boy or girl but this fabulous color let us go ahead and start putting the nursery together...you can add blues or pinks to this shade because it is the perfect sage...
3,Wrong episodes???,"I suspect (hope, even) that the episodes being advertised, like with part one, are NOT what will be actually on the discs. Three of those episodes, Secret Weapons, Micromanagement, and Masters of All Time, were mistakenly included in the part one DVD, while three episodes that should have been on part one were not (Memory Blank, The Ultimate Enemy parts 1 & 2). I would hope that they would be included in part 2 so that the two sets together would have all season two episodes, albeit in a hopelessly incorrect order.I'm sure Nickelodeon is to blame, but Shout Factory should have put out the video they advertised. Be forewarned before you buy."
5,More 10 episodes of Danny Phantom's second season arrives on DVD,More ten episodes on DVD include:Disc 1:31.Secert Weapons32.Flirting with Disaster33.Micromanagement34.Beauty Marked35.King TuckDisc 2:36.Masters of All Time37.Reality Trip (1)38.Reality Trip (2)39.Double Cross My Heart40.Kindred SpiritsThat's all. I know the episode guide in Season 2 is not correct but they will fix them. Anyway Season 3 will come out in 2012 or 2013.
3,Need to have entire season in one DVD,It seems ridiculous to have to pay for two DVD's for one season. They also have some of the same episodes from the first DVD.
4,A sampler worth owning,"One of the smallest of music genres is the ""sampler worth buying"" category. Most have, at best, a couple good singles. More often than not, one reads the track list, whoops it up at seeing lots of favorite artists, and then quickly finds out that the songs are castaways that didn't find their way onto the artists' albums for a reason. This CD is different. I've owned it for years and still play it on a semi-regular basis. The tracks from Dinosaur, Jr., Sebadoh, Billy Bragg, Radiohead, the Lemonheads, the Walkabouts, and others are all first rate. This compilation is worth much more than the few dollars that you can surely find it for."
3,Nothing much will be gained by reading this.,"""Spark Notes Pride and Prejudice"" was a tad long in it's descriptions of the chapters and I didn't care for the amount of chapters it explained at once. The explanations were not in full at times. It's basically an abridged version of the novel. As always, you should read the Spark Notes AFTER you have read ""Pride and Prejudice."" I ""sorta"" recommend."
1,This might be the worst album ever.,"I was ripped off. This is a lame rip off of the 2 Many Djs album which was great. I was duped into thinking it was one of their Soulwax projects. Avoid the Destroy all DJs album at all costs. It is terrible, clumsy and boring as hell. KRS One should hunt these people down for what they've done and demand one tearful apology after another while serving papers for defamation of character."
2,"Make Your Own, It'll Be Better..","I was expecting much better. First, it seems like this cd was made soley to expose the few new cuts on it. Second, there aren't really any stand out moments of great mixing/programming. Third, no flow. I love mashing, but this isn't where it's at. Get Kill The DJ instead. The coupon inside this disk makes up for a little of the burn.."
3,Simple. Easy.,"This is a useful textbook to have as a handy, quick reference. Not optimal for studying or new learning, but a helpful review. The material is thoroughly researched & easily accessible. I give it a ""B""."
4,Good lip balm,24 of these will last a long while. They seem to be in good condition and buying in bulk makes them cheaper than one at a time. They work well for me and each one seems to last a long time. They are not sealed like the ones I buy at the drug store but seem to be fine.
4,Cheap (but decent) medical alcohol swabs.,Cheap medical alcohol swabs. I recommend them for people who want to keep themselves or little objects clean. It is too small to clean medium or large objects though.
3,Swab Review,I am diabetic and using swabs are part of my testing. I am glad I could buy this in quantity.
2,Overpriced,"These alcohol swabs work just as I expected. BD usually is a quality product. However, a week after I bought these online, I noticed them in the Costco pharmacy for less than $4.00. And Costco doesn't require a membership for their pharmacy. If delivery to your door is worth $9.00, go for it. Otherwise, it might be a good idea to shop around."
4,A Great Game,"The Lost Vikings is a very fun game, and I would definatley recommend it. However, the levels get increasingly harder and require lots of patience and persevearence. It is still lots of fun, as the characters often make jokes and each level is unique."
4,Svenn Nutter,"I purchased this several years ago on cassette. It has a good Christian perspective, but like many dream interpretation series, falls short of its potential. Jackson descibes types of dreams, gives several interesting examples of dreams and confirms that G-d does in fact still speak through dreams. He does this in a Christian context and without all the New Age nonsense. Unfortunately, it just scatches the surface and ends."
4,Handy small cordless phone,This is a 2004 model cordless phone. Because of the long life on the shelf the battery may not be useable. I had to replace mine before I could use it. I knew this might happen before I ordered it. The seller made an adjustment on the battery after I notified them. I ordered this phone because I had one like it before and liked it very much because of its small size. I can carry it in my pocket like a cell phone. It has good range and lockable keypad that keep it from getting turned on by mistake.
4,"good phone, but qulity could be better","Got this phone for $39.99 from Amazon, overall a good phone, works great, no problem with my Wifi network.Here is something i don't like:The build qulity isn't very good, it feels like cheap plastic.The buttons are not backlit.The sound qulity is not as good as most corded phones."
3,"Very funny, but missing something","This is an incredibly funny video and a must for any DS fan, but the problem is....:The box talks about bloopers and out takes, but there are so many bloopers and not enough outtakes. I love to see when actors have to stop and break character.Alas, that is why this video has 3 stars and not five."
2,Sad,Don't get me wrong; I am a huge fan. That's why I bought the video. But it was mostly a bore and disappointment. Big deal if the actors stumble over some lines or if some candles go out. The outakes were interesting but they seem to only represent maybe 10% of the video.
3,"Great for Nemo fans, but better for older kids","I bought this for my almost-3 year old daughter b/c she loves 'finding nemo'. The way we play memory with her is we take out about 10-12 cards and play a game with those, as obviously playing with all the cards would make the game too difficult and not enjoyable. But my main complaint about this particular version is that a lot of the cards look very similar but are subtley different. For instance, there are about 4 different variations of a Nemo card. So I would recommend this set to a slightly older child and pick a simpler set, where all of the cards are markedly different (like the Disney themed set, which we also have) for the 3 year old crowd. Otherwise, my daughter loves it as all children this age seem to love playing Memory."
2,Not a good version of memory for younger kids,"I'd really recommend against this version of memory. I think there just weren't enough different characters in Finding Nemo to make this work. Too many of the pictures were too similar, making this a bit challenging for younger kids. (I kept forgetting which version of different fish were hidden where myself. ""I found Nemo! Oh, wait, that's the wrong Nemo *again*..."") My four year old quit in frustration. A Memory version with more variety in the pictures would probably be a lot easier to actually remember. :) We haven't played this again since, and I had to pick up a copy of original Memory instead."
1,Low end product,"Due to reviews prior to my purchase (Thank you) my expectations were low. I just needed a cover to keep the water from spotting my glass patio table and would not blow off from the wind. However, I was still shocked at how very thin the plastic was and relieved to find it damaged so I could justify returning it and wasting the $10.00 round trip shipping cost. I would say this is a cute cover but overpriced, if this was $7.99 my expectations would've been met. Delivery was a few days late but the refund was prompt."
1,Hideous,"The print on this cover looks very cheap. I have to question anyone who thinks it looks like natural stone inlay. Unlike the description states, it will not fit on a square table. It comes with double-sided tape to try to stretch under the table to flatten it out. Problem is, the tape won't stick and the cover doesn't flatten well. I returned it."
4,"It's plastic, not tile, and looks it...",Don't think your table will look like a tile inlay. It's just plastic and it looks it. I bought it to protect my glass table top over the winter and it looks and works just fine for that purpose. The plastic is thick and the elastic is strong.
5,table cover,absolutely love this!! we have a glass table and 2 kids. so tired of cleaning it and seeing sticky fingers. this makes the table look neat :)
4,Table Cover Great for Hiding Scarred Tabletops,"This is the second tile table cover that I have purchased. Not only do they make both of my outdoor tables look like they match, they also cover up the scratches and discoloration resulting from the tables being out in the elements. An attractive, inexpensive way to make an old table look new!"
5,Tuscan Table Cover,"This table cover is awesome!!Our old round table we have had for years and had spray painted it this spring and saw this on Amazonand ordered it. It made my table look like a new table, goes great with my new green umbrella and my brown chairs. Am so satisfied with the quality ."
4,Tile table cloth,I really like this table cloth. It looks like real tile when it's on your table. The quality is very good just make sure if you have chairs that swivel that they don't hit the side of the table because it can rip the table cloth. My grandchildren did this but I fixed it with a little duck tape on underside. I liked it so much I ordered another.
5,Great deal for the price!,"2nd one I've purchased. The first one lasted about 5 years. Outdoors on patio table yearround. Holds up very well, considering exposure to the elements and extremes of cold and heat (I live in Iowa). Finally started showing some wear (a couple of small tears caused by squirrels). For the bargain price, I just bought a new one."
4,Highly recommend!,"This a great alternative to placemats or a traditional tablecloth for everyday. I have a 48"" glass table.The sun streams in and shows the streaks and dust specs. I bought this for everyday use but wouldremove it if I were having company. Except when my bridge group comes over and then it is ideal asa table cover for playing cards.It was pretty wrinkled when it arrived but I just put it on the table, took a folded flour sack towel andironed the wrinkles right out."
4,Great cover for my coffee table!,"I was looking for something to cover my round coffee table to protect it from kids. This works great to protect it from wet cups, dirty fingers and scratches from toys. Easy to wipe down and remove when company is coming!"
4,It looks real!,"I have a cherry table my mother purchased for me and it needs to be laquered.. I use it as my main kitchen table and don't want it to get water marks on it. I have had many compliments on it as it looks real. Do put it in the dryer as they recommend to get the wrinkles out. It did smell like plastic, but it went away within a few days. I just wiped it down w/ 409 to help w/ the smell at first. Until I find the time & money to get the table laquered, I will use this... Love it!"
3,Fun Table Cover,"I like this table cover because it's fun. The elastic prevents it from blowing off in the wind. The only problem is that it will poof out a little underneath the table if your table isn't big enough to pull it taught, but that's no big deal. It's just a fun plastic cover. It would be better if it had a pull string though."
5,Vesuvius Stone Vinyl Cloth,I would recommend this product to anyone who can use it and I do when guests remark on its attractive look and practicality. It can be relied on to solidly hug the underside of the table.
1,response,was miss represented on the site and not at all what i wanted to order or even did order by any means
2,Did not fit my table,"I ordered this for a small rectangle table and perhaps it's meant for just a round table, because it did not fit well and looked bunched up under the table on all 4 sides. I guess I was hoping for something quite a bit more flexible that would shape itself to the size of the table."
3,Didn't fit my table,"Have to return it for a larger size. Unfortunately, they don't make this particular design in an XLg. The pattern is lovely and I only wish it would have fit."
3,Too short,"The three stars is not for the quality as the guitar strap is made of genuine tough leather. I am not on the taller size when it comes to height, but this guitar strap comes in an amazing short size that once installed the guitar is almost at chest level even when adjusted to its longest available mode."
3,Fullmore Colored,"So far, so good. It certainly gives full look results. I've used it about 3 times within a week. But, I'm not sure if frequent use of this product would hinder healthy hair growth."
3,Rubs off.,"I have used several colored hair sprays and this one is middle of the pack. It sprays out well and covers well. The color matches good. However, it rubs off easily. Basically you can't touch your head after you've sprayed it on. This is the case just minutes afterwards, or hours. Streaks N Tips rubs off easily too. Graftobian and Adair won't rub off."
2,Thickening Hairspray,"Hair spray worked on making hair appear fuller and thicker. However, spray can gets clogged or losses pressure in can, soyou cannot use it any longer after a few applications. Also, you will need to clean up spray residue in bathroom after each use."
1,VERY BAD AND VERY EMBARASSING!,"Don't buy this garbage. It smells bad and it looks like you are just spray painting your head. It's exactly like spray paint except spray paint stays in one area and this garbage goes everywhere. The spray does not stay on your head too long, even if you apply your own hair spray holder. It is very messy. I had residue all over my face, hands, arms, and anything else around me. It just makes you very dirty and you definitely notice it when you shower it all away. When you tilt your head, tiny fragments of the spray fibers will fall everywhere and makes you look like you have a very bad dandruff problem. If you want to have dirty fingernails and embarass yourself and want to know what it feel like to survive an oil spill, use this product."
2,Nozzle Clogs,"The spray nozzle on this product repeatedly clogs. I am able to unclog it using hot water, but, after a few sprays, it clogs again. The spray itself is ok. It is kind of dull compared to the rest of my hair, and it runs when I sweat. If the spray nozzle didn't clog, I would probably use up this bottle and not order it again.I called Spencer Forrest and complained about the clogged nozzle, and, basically, the sales representative I spoke to said there was nothing she could do. Crappy company, crappy product. I would recommend xFusion fibers instead. This stuff is a waste of money. You will maybe get 5 uses out of it before the nozzle clogs."
5,Excellent---very good,"The product is excellent,I have small bald spot on the top of my head,I use this product to cover it daily,itworks very well and it easily shampoes out when I bathe. Amazon has fast deleivery and although they charge about $1.35 more than other places,I'm happy with their service and will continue to order through Amazon. Hope this is enough information for your survey? Thanks for the excellent service,Bobby Pazo,way down in Key West,Fl"
4,Fullmore Colored Hair Thickener - Auburn,"I absolutely love this stuff. It'g great for covering grey roots and gives great body, especially in the crown in back of my head. It does leave a film on hair so I try to only spray it where needed. I have been using it for about a year now and ithas solved my thin hair at the crown. I would totally recommend it. I have medium brown hair with a tint of auburn and this color is perfect."
3,"Works well, but not healthy if you're trying to grow hair back","First, this works well. It's infinitely easier than that eye shadow type coverup that takes forever to apply. This stuff goes on in about 15 seconds. Then a minute or two to dry and I can leave the house. I also noticed that even if I'm sweating at the gym, it is not dripping down my face (I was worried it might but it doesn't.) It also does not drip in light rain. It does come out once soap/shampoo is applied.I brought it to my hairdresser who has been working with me to grow my hair back (bosley, vitamins, stuff like that.) He looked at the ingredients and was pretty surprised, said the ingredients are not good for me and definitely don't leave it on my hair overnight. Only use once in a while so I don't clog my scalp pores with its contents. Bummer. I was appreciating some normalcy using this stuff. Even felt sexy one night for a party with my hair looking decent."
3,quality,If you sweat stained shirt collar.Covers well...anyway...Even after hairspray fraction disslved by rain./water/Covers well and does not fail in dry weather.
4,Works better than the photostitch included with elements,"Version 3 came with my Lumix camera. I run the software on a Mac G5. I found the software to be very good at what it advertises. It would be nice to have some more powerful tools included. Definitely a consumer targeted software, not for professionals."
5,Excellent Weight Loss Book,My doctor gave me a copy of this book years ago. I still have that copy but it was worn and the pages were getting yellow. I found this new one and bought it right away. The tips are great.
1,Intel is dropping support for Netport Express in June of 200,I've had the device for two years. The last firmware upgrade does not and will not support Windows XP...
4,Easy to use,"This is a great scale for measuring body mass figures. I found it easy to set up and easy to use. The price was a bit high, I saw a similar unit at the big box store for about $20 less after I had already ordered this unit."
3,"Could be worse, maybe","I purchased this scale based upon the repeated reviews citing consistent accurate scale readings. Although the variation are not huge, I routinely find 3 different weights registered when done one minute apart right in a row. The body fat and water body figures are even more erratic and seem to follow no pattern as my weight has been dropping.The scale is easy to read and gives a relatively quick weight reading and (as above noted) this is the only reading really worthwhile to me. If I could buy the same scale cheaper without the body/water info, I would do so.I cannot say that this is not the best of many bad choices, only that it does not provide the consistent weight results that seemed to be reported here. Perhaps the others are a lot worse. But I wouldn't know."
3,Tested,"I received this product about 2 weeks ago, being my first digi scale purchased I have mixed feelings. First off when i get on the scale it gives me one weight, 30 seconds later a different weight so i'm a little skeptical about its accuracy. The readout is big and clear. I was expecting more reliable information from this product but I guess it's just a good estimate. Back to the good old pen and paper"
3,not sure of bodyfat accuracy,"scale is the easiest to use, and probably the best setting I've seen, but the bodyfat level has got to be much lower than reality. Calipers show 27%, scale shows 20%. Which is right?"
1,Faulty Bad Product ! No customer service.,"I will never purchase anything from The Competitive Edge again. I purchased this scale. Everytime I weigh myself it varies from 1 to 7lbs. There is no way to calibrate it. It simple does not work. The Competitive Edge sells merchandise that is defective and does not function properly. When you contact them to make an exchange or a return, there answer is no. If you want this scale, purchase it from another vendor NOT The Competitive Edge. Their merchandise is damaged."
1,Dead on arrival,"This thing has a nice feature list, but unfortunately it is a piece of junk. It arrived promptly after ordering. It was packaged nicely. It looks fine, kinda cheap in appearance, it just doesn't work at all. DOA I bought an Omron hand held BFM and a separate scale instead."
3,"it works, kinda","It's accurate as far as total weight, body comp is pretty inaccurate(gives drastically different readings frequently). Overall it's not worth the price, and is hard to program."
5,Excellent scale,"This is a very accurate scale that if desired can give the user plenty of additional information. Great value for the price, we have not had any problems whatsoever."
2,Great for Weight...Not for Body Fat Readings...,"In terms of precise weigth measurement, this thing is great. But in terms of body fat readings, it's not accurate at all. I got this scale for the express purpose of reading body fat and I should have known better. How in the world do I go from 16.5% body fat in the morning to 14.2% in the evening? I really don't get it and even when I measure at the same time every day, it fluctuates like crazy! I can't get any sort of reading in terms if I'm heading in the right direction: 17.1% one day, 16.5% the next, 15.3% the next, and then 16.8% the next...all in a span of 4 days. So if you're looking for just weight, by all means get this or any other cheaper scale. But for body fat %, don't expect consistency at all."
2,Good while it worked.,"I had this scale for about a year, and then it stopped working. There were no loose wires; I replaced the batteries; I shook it trying to get it to work. I tried for a couple of weeks. It was dead. I would not buy again. At the time, it was more expensive. But, even at the lower price, you don't want it to be a yearly expense.I am buying a lower cost model, without the ""hi-tech"" fat monitor. If it dies after a year--no problem, but the simpler design means there is less to go wrong."
4,Neat!,"My wife and I are not over the top weight watchers, but to have a decent scale around keeps you from guessing. Hey,I know I've gained weight but...Have I? This is a clean unit and I am happy with the quality, my wife just gives it nasty glares. It does what they said it would. I would recommend it for general use."
4,It's a nice scale...,"This is a nice digital scale for weight. And the body fat reading are somewhat useful, if you don't take them too seriously. The manual gives you no guidance whether to enter yourself as 'male/female' or 'male/female athlete'. By going to the web site, you can get a hazy description of the difference, and make your best guess. In practice, for me, selecting 'male athlete' will give a body fat reading half that of 'male'. So, you really have no idea what your actual body fat % is, but using the same measure over time can tell you if the % is increasing or decreasing.I ended up using 'male', not 'athlete', since that number corresponded most closely with a recent figure computed by my doctor, using a hand held monitor from another manufacturer. But, without that guidance, I'd have no idea what the is real number. So, this is a good scale, with a FWIW body fat monitoring bell-and-whistle."
5,Tanita BF680W Duo Scale,This scale performs great. For two people it will remember your settings and weight. I would recommend this to anyone. It is also very accurate. Great product.
3,Weight Scale,"The weight is not very accurate. I can step on the scale within a few minutes and each time I will get a different reading.I am disappointed in Tanita, I thought it would be more accurate"
2,Ok but not special,"It works as a scale but the other functions are not consistent. The weight is good, i measured the other stuff at the exact same time barefoot after cleaning my feet fully hydrated one hour after consuming water. its just unreliable the scale part works fine though."
5,Great value,This scale is accurate and easy to use. It includes a bodyfat rating as well as one for hydration. The weight is similar to the one I get at my Weight Watchers meeting. The display is easy to read and it comes up quickly.
2,complex transaction,"When the item arrived it was apparent that the package had previously been opened - the packaging was torn. The item was soiled by a previous purchaser - stains on the surface. Worse, it did not work when put into body fat mode. The display did not act as predicted in the instructions, and it did not give body fat data. After many trials I call online fitness angry as heck. They told me to keep the scale and use it as a scale only. They credited my credit card. After a week of using it as a scale, I tried the body fat mode again and it worked. I called online fitness and left a message that they should put the purchase back on the credit card - which I don't think they have yet done."
2,Tanita BF680W Duo Scale - Inaccurate At Higher Weights,"This scale does fine at lower body weights, but is totally inaccurate at higher weights (240 lbs. +). It has absolutely no repeatable accuracy! You can weigh yourself 10 times in a row, and get 8 different weights, varying as much as a pound! The body fat feature is a joke! Buy a cheaper scale - save some money."
3,Save your money if buying this scale for body fat percent.,"I bought this scale because I was looking for a digital scale and also wanted to see if my body fat measurements that I have been taking with the Accu-Measure Body Fat Caliper was accurate. As a weight scale, the Tanita is excellent (and the reason I gave it as many as 3 stars) and I decided to keep it despite the body fat being off. I exercise regularly and I never get a reading below 18% bodyfat and varies between 18% and 20% - even in athletic mode. With my $7 calipers it tells me I am about 14.8% body fat. I was recently tested in a gym and I was at around 13-14% so the cheap plastic gadget did much better. So save your money - buy a plain old digital scale and the Accu-Measure Body Fat Caliper here at Amazon and with the savings go have a nice healthy dinner!"
3,consistant,This product weights me approx 4 #s higher than my Dr's scale and the body fat is also higher by 3%. But the numbers are consistant. I just subtract the 4 #s and feel oh so much better.
3,Not as accurate as it should be,"Off by 1.5 lbs after testing with static weight. Not acceptable for the price of this scale. If weight is off, so are all other calculations."
5,Exactly what I need,"In a weight scale, that is! It is easy to use and understand. The display is definitely big enough to read. I am runner so I put it on athletic mode, which the only difference is that it doesn't display where I am on the body fat range, since they say it can vary for athletes. I don't believe that to be an enhanced feature, but whatever because I still like to know where I am on the body fat range. It has two memory buttons, perfect for just my husband and me and a guest feature for anyone else, rarely used, but still great to have just in case."
2,Disappointed,After reading the reviews for this product I felt confident I would be satisfied. However I'm not. Maybe because I used an Iron Man scale that was phenomenal before this. It doesn't measure body fat as accurately as I hoped. It's an expensive version of a Wal-Mart brand you can get a lot cheaper. I would NOT recommend this if you're looking for quality. I'm still considering returning it.
5,How to open to your spiritual self,"A wonderfully funny tale of spiritual adventure metaphysical buffoonery and visionary insight. Chuck Coburn is a modern day trickster, a combination of Woody Allen, the Dalai Lama and Joe Sixpack."
5,"Down to earth, practical primer for developing psychics",A bouquet of pleasant surprises - informational as it relates Coburn's experiences in an instructive style and inspirational in encouraging its readers to open to their own inherent talents. These topics are usually relegated to esoteric speculation but Coburn brings them down to earth and portrays them as part of humankind's creative potential.
3,soft metal,"The hilt is beautiful and well done but the sword itself is soft pewter and bends so easily I'm afraid it will break off. I was hoping for a necklace that I could wear all the time, but this one is so soft I don't dare sleep in it. It is very fragile."
5,Great FM sound,"I love this item. Couldn't bring myself to shell out the bucks for the Bose and am smugly pleased I didn't. This is a must-have in my kitchen.However, if you need a clock and presets but still want great sound, I recommend the Boston Accoustics Recepter Radio. It's got comparable sound and has similar reception and sound integrity. It also avoids over-designed buttons and ""features"". It runs about $50 more."
4,FM Great AM Not so great,"The title of this review says it all. AM reception is better than average but I hear all sorts of funny high pitched hisses with AM. FM is perfect. Also, when used as a speaker for a device with a headphone jack it won't act as a radio until you unhook the cable."
4,a great radio,"Sangean has been known to make really good radios, and this one does not disappoint. It was received on time and it was even better than pictured. The radio itself is just the perfect size (using it in the kitchen). The dials/knobs are perfect, very easy to operate and locate all radio stations. The sound is great as well. Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase."
2,This story is the pits,"When Romana installs a TARDIS component that the Doctor has been ignoring, a distress signal is picked up and the TARDIS materialises on the planet Chloris, a planet on which metal is in short supply. As they try to find the being who set up the distress signal, they fall foul of Chloris' ruler, the Lady Adrasta, who will do anything to retain her ruthless grip on the planet...Season seventeen of Doctor Who seems to be one in which the show lost its way. As a rule, the stories were less well thought out than they should have been, and contained somewhat ludicrous elements. 'The Creature from the Pit' is one of the worst offenders - science that it would be generous to describe as half-baked, unlikely cultures, and strange creatures all conspire to drown any good points which the story has.If you aren't a Doctor Who completist, look elsewhere."
2,Disappointing,The julienne slices were mushy and not nice neat little strips. I had previously purchased the the double edged ceramic slicer which I love but this one wasn't in the same league.
2,Not Impressed,I bought this wanting a julienne that was sort of matchstick size and this does what all the other julienne gadgets do and it was more expensive. Makes very thin sticks. I guess you have to use a mandoline to get matchsticks the size I'm looking for.
2,I don't use it.,"I often times don't write reviews, but I always read them. I bought the slicer and the julienne Kyocera. I cook a lot, almost every night, but I found that these are just sitting in my drawers because the device that you are supposed to poke into the vegetable to hold it while you slice doesn't work well; it just doesn't really hold it. So then I found myself holding it with my bare hand until I gently nicked my finger and got a hairline cut. When I julienne, I just use that peeler looking device; it works much better and is much less expensive. For thin slicing, I use a good knife..."
2,Disappointed and scared,"I've had this slicer for a while. I've tried many variations on using it more safely--securely placing it horizontally over a bowl, wearing an oven mitt to hold the vegetable, gingerly using the flimsy plastic safety. Overall, it's just terrifying. I realize all mandolines are scary, but the light, flimsy nature of this one makes it especially so.As to the actual performance, I feel like the carrots come out mushy and too thin. Same with potatoes, though the resulting hash browns were still delicious. The vertical ceramic teeth on my slicer have broken off in places, so now my slices are not uniform. I keep the tool in a drawer with only a few other things, but it gets banged about a bit and there is no cover for the blades. I also have cut myself just reaching into the drawer.I feel like I should have saved my $20 and invested in a more versatile, substantial tool."
3,Moderately pleased,I found this item difficult to use. Instructions would have helped condiserably. I tried to julienne a green apple for a slaw recipe and it only clumped up and would not separate easily. I had to finish cutting the apple for the recipe by hand. I can only hope other vegetables will be easier to maneuver. Clean up was fine.
4,Sharp,Be careful. It takes a few seconds to slice a vegetable and before you know it your finger is sliced too! The flat hand guard is only good for flat vegetables and I've never met a flat vegetable yet.
4,Great little mandolin!,"This is not the most high tech or fancy mandolin ever, but its ease of use makes up for it entirely. It's not the most sturdy and the slices aren't perfectly even but they're good enough for instances when the thickness doesn't have to be perfect: salads, sandwiches, any regular, every day dish. Maybe if you were making homemade french fries or something where it really mattered that the thickness was exact, then this wouldn't be the best tool. But really I use this almost every day and for just cooking regular dishes at home it works great.Also really great if you only have to cook for 1 or 2, OR if you only need to slice one thing for a recipe. We also have a Cuisinart food processor (which we LOVE) but it's not worth the set up if we only need to slice 1 thing. This is where this thing comes in really handy. AND it'd dishwasher safe!I bought the kevlar gloves with it after reading the reviews and I'm glad that I did. No sliced fingers!"
5,Mandoline Slicer,"Oh boy! Is this a grand piece of equipment. I bought it to slice cucumbers paper thin for pickling and does it ever do the job. My wife just asked me if it would work on onions for a green bean salad, so I sliced up an onion in nothing flat. It is very easy to clean up - just run under the water tap and dry."
4,SUMMARY,"This book starts out with a history of silviculture in the US and then compares it to the practice in other countries with different forest types. The remaining chapters then address particular goals for forest management such as timber production, water resources, wildlife, etc and then finishes each chapter with types of careers related to that particular goal. Illustrated with black and white photos. Each chapter has an extensive bibliography."
1,Good Idea - Poor Product,"I bought the product over a year ago at Camping World (and a higher price) without researching it's customer ratings. I've only used it to flush my black water tank around 8 times. I have taken care to turn the pressure up slowly (as noted on reviews elsewhere) but I noticed the last two times things weren't right. I removed the unit from the tank yesterday and found it was no longer spinning. Because of the fact it works well, when it works, and I've got a big hole in my black water tank I'll be getting a replacement, but there must be another out there that doesn't fail so quickly.BTW, others have complained that even brand new ones don't spin (it's like a spinning sprinkler head in your tank). When it works, it works quite well, so good luck if you decide to buy one."
4,Great!!,"This is definitely one of YUI's better albums, along with Rolling Star. Sometimes, her music can get a little repetitive, but this album is more unique than the rest. It shows a lot of her growing talent as a J-pop star. If you compare it to one of her earlier albums, from me to you, for example, you will see the great progress she has made. I absolutely love CHE.R.R.Y.!!-ShinigamiSango-chan, not on her account ^-^"
3,Basic Baby,Bee Smart vocabulary builder helped my niece so much that the video is too worn out for me. Now my mom has to buy the video again. A must in your childs early video collection!!
2,Shown with BRASS contacts ... they're not.,"The picture clearly shows this cap to have brass inserts (the ONLY reason I chose to purchase this cap). The product delivered has the cheap, poorer performing, aluminum inserts just like most of the others listed. I have not yet decided if I will send it back or keep it - just don't think you are getting the pictured item!!The shipping was really fast and the checkout was fast and easy too - so no complaints there. Just send me the item pictured (or give a disclaimer that clearly says you're not getting the better brass inserts)!"
2,Caveat emptor,"I have used this mat for two years now (2-3 classes/wk), and its useful life is about over. I'm in the market for a Manduka. I have washed it twice in one of the high efficiency washers, and the result was good, but the extra thick and squishiness of the mat is its downfall.I bought the thicker mat especially because of bony knees, but the thickness came back to haunt me in other ways. First, in a vigorous session of standing poses, my feet would hurt and I would have to step off the mat for balance poses. Second, the softness of the mat made it begin to shred after some vigorous vinyasa sequences.I have seen the Manduka up close and personal, and I think the density will provide the protection I sought and be easier on my feet. It also grips like crazy."
2,Meh.,"It didn't fit well on my Graco snugride. My daughter loved it, but the song was so short. I couldn't reach the button to restart the song from the driver's seat. After I used it for about a month, my pediatrician told me not to drive with it attached anyway. That it is a safety hazard if I should get into an accident."
4,I agree...,"I agree that this is a great toy and my daughter would grab it as soon as I put her in the carseat, but it is in a tough spot on the carseat for getting baby in and out. Unless you unattach it and attach it each time, it was a little difficult getting her in without moving her head to the side or moving it up out of the way without hitting her head.Now we are in a big carseat without the handle, so I'm going to do what the other parent suggested and have her play with it on her lap. But of course that negates the thrill of moving the fish back and forth. Any other suggestions of where or how this can be hung??? I'd love to get some more use out of it and would hate to have to sell it on eBay so soon :)"
4,Great toy but could be improved.,This is a great toy. My son eventually learnedto push the button himself while traveling inthe car. He loved it. Other children were drawn to it as well.We only used it in his newborn carrier until hewas about 6 months old. The drawbacks I experienced with thisitem were that it was too close to baby's head where it could be attached to carrier. It was difficultto remove or place baby in carrier for fear of hitting his head.I think it's a great toy but could be better if theyfound a better way to attach to carrier.
3,Cute little toy bar,I had this on my 3 month old boy's car seat until I had his car seat inspected by our local fire department they suggested removing it. They told me that nothing should be dangeling from their car seats. I'll hold onto it...maybe it can attach to his crib.
2,Didn't really like this product,"This product is okay in the daylight, but in the evening when we are in the car my daughter can't even see it. It doesn't light up or anything. It is cute though and she does stare at it in the daylight."
2,"NOT UNSAFE, JUST UNPRACTICAL","I bought this toy because it looked so cute on the shelf; it even kept my son's interest. My son loved the music; however, the batteries do not last very long! The batteries are not even normal everyday batteries; and I was only able to find the batteries at an electronics store! Also, I had to remove the toy every time I removed or placed my child in his car seat so that the toy didn't hit my son in the face!"
1,Leaks and hard to handle a carrier with one attached,"I love Baby Einstein products but this one is rotten. I agree that when its attached it is really hard to mauever the carrier, plus it hangs low and in baby's face. We never noticed ours leaking, it was just empty one day....I told Baby Einstein about it and they mailed me a replacement toy. They were very nice and apologetic."
2,Not impressed...,"My son really loves to watch the fishies move in his Fisher Price Aquarium bouncer, so I thought this toy seemed like a great thing for his car seat. Only thing is, the fish don't move very well once you attach the thing to the car seat handle! You have to be able to rock the thing from side to side and you can't move it that way once you attach it to the handle.I also agree with all the reviewers that say the music doesn't play long enough. If these toy manufacturers had to deal with the screaming child once the music stopped playing, they might think again about putting the option of continuous play on toys like this!Cute concept, but in the end, I think Walmart's getting this toy back and I'll look for another toy for the carrier handle."
4,Great Product.... except for one thing--,"I love it, my daughter is facinated with it... the only problem is that the fish inside don't move! They are pretty much stationary and I think that my daughter sometimes stares at them in hopes that they will move. Otherwise, thumbs up!"
3,mom of 3,This toy bar is cute. The music plays a very short song. The toy bar will not work on Graco carriers.
3,Gets in the way,"My mom bought this for my sons infant carrier. Thought it would keep him entertained. The good parts about the toy are the sounds and the floating fish. He did like that part. The bad part is that when it was on the carrier, you were not able to hook the carrier to your arm because the toy was in the way. YOu had to hold the carrier by the handle. For some people this is not a problem but when you have a big baby, it gets tiring. The velcro needs to be longer so the top connection will hang lower."
2,Bad choice for the infant carrier,I bought this to use it in my baby's carrier.But it was a very bad choice.It is hard for the baby to look at it.I guess it would be better in the crib.But I haven't tried it yet.
3,Not sure yet...,"I got this toy bar last week for my daughters carseat. I gave it 3 stars because I haven't really had it long enough to know if I like it or not. I will say that her seat is a Graco SnugRide and the toy bar does fit very well on it...maybe for those who can't get it to work you should try different positions on the handle. It took me a few minutes to find a good spot. Reading the reviews have made me leary...so I have only used the bar when we were in a restaurant and I could keep an eye on my daughter. However, she seems to take to it very well with the fish and colors. I am considering switching to something softer like Bugs on Board for while in the car...but keeping the bar for other times when I have to leave her in her seat!"
3,head bonker,"We got this as a gift when my son had just about outgrown his car seat. It was cute and he would look at while driving, but to get him in and out of the seat I had to remove it, otherwise it would smack him in the head. Eventually I took it off and tied it to his high chair, where it was great fun until I tried to clean it, now it only works occassionally. But he still likes to hear the songs."
2,wasn't impressed at all,"I saw this at Babies r Us and thought ""it was cute and what a perfect toy to keep my son occupied while in the car."" Boy - was I wrong, you continuously have to press the button for the music and when you put the bar down it sits right on top of your baby's head. I returned it as soon as I brought it home and tried it out. I wouldn't recommend this."
2,Einstein Neptune Toy Bar,My daughter loves this toy but it is very frustrating because the button to turn the music on has to be pushed after every very short tune it plays. It would've been much better if it was motion sensored. I was going to return it for something motion sensored but the packaging got thrown away.
2,Not worth the money,"I received this as a gift. I tried it out for a little while, seeing I didn't have anything else to entertain my daughter. We had to take it off anytime we wanted to move the bar on the carseat back, which was a lot, and the music didn't play long enough. We also noticed it could be a safety hazard if in an accident. I ended up buying a set of ""child of mine"" soft toys similar to the sassy bugs. Save the money."
2,too much for an infant seat toy.,"I bought this when I was in an overzealous toy buying mood. When attached to an infant car seat, I makes it hard to put baby in and take baby out. Its too high for an infant to really play with and our pediatrician and child car seat inspectors told us that the hard plastic is dangerous if we were to get into a car accident. We returned it shortly there after. Get Sassy's Bugs on Board."
3,"Nice, but doesn't fit well...","I bought this toy for my son (5 months) becuase of his love for the baby einstein movies and other baby einstein toys. I love the general idea of the toy bar, however I am very dissapointed about several differnt things....1. The toy bar tends to hit my son in the head, and has to be removed every time I put him in or take him out of his car seat.2. The songs on the toy bar only play for around 30 seconds and it is cumbersome to have to reach back and continue to puch the play button.3. Finally, it is nearly impossible to carry his car seat with the toy bar attached (there is no room to comfortably grab the handle).I gave up using the Einstein Neptune Toy Bar and went back to the Bugs on Board (available at toysrus.com too)!"
1,D's Mom,"My 4 month old got this for Christmas and it's disappointing. It's labeled for the car seat but it says its not safe for use in a moving vehicle. Also, if you attach it to the car seat it hits the baby in the head when you move the car seat handle. THe baby like it but it's not handy. It is easy to take off and put on. Maybe it would work better with a different car set but I don't think we will get much use from it."
1,Disappointed,"I loved this toy when I saw it and bought it for my 4 month olds infant car seat. Unfortuantly, she hated it! Besides that fact that you have to take it off every time you get them in or out, but she couldn't reach it. After she was able to get a hold of it she would scream because she couldn't get the toys to her mouth. Another bummer is that the music can only be activated by pushing the button and it last for about 10 seconds. FYI -- the button is impossible to push while driving!!!! This toy is not worth buying even though it IS really cute!<br /><br />"
1,Einstein-ian NOT,"Cute, yes, but smart this toy is not. 1)When this toy is attached to the handle of the infant carseat/carrier, taking hold of the handle or taking baby in and out becomes difficult. 2)When my daughter really began enjoying her hands she was just a little over two months old, but the dangling items on this toy were still too far for her to ever succeed in reaching them. She would soon get frustrated or just plain bored. 3)The under-water part of this toy is really boring, too, the fish do nothing to captivate. 4)The music does need to be restarted often.Get the WHOOZIT Activity Spiral instead. It's takes less than a second to place, or remove: it simply stretches between the two sides of the handle, and you can place it at whatever height you want to. It's colorful, interactive, soft (so it can be left with baby while driving). It doesn't play any music, but that's no big loss compared to the Einstein Neptune Bar."
1,be sure to read the fine print!,"I received the toy bar as a gift and have yet to try it out, but I did read the warning on the bar itself which states, ""Do not use in moving vehicles."" No toy should be advertised to be used on a baby carrier if it's not to be used while in travel! Not everyone is going to read that fine print, and I'm sure there's a reason the manufacturer put it there!"
3,"Kid loves it, but sure is annoying","I have this attached to my daughter's car seat. We have a Chicco travel system and it does fit the handle ok and slides up and out of the way for entry/exit. Other than the expectation at the characters in the fluid window would move more than they actually do, I have two problems with it: 1) Eats batteries like crazy - and it takes THREE watch batteries that I had to order for it, because I couldn't find locally (I've stocked up), and 2) most aggrivating, the music only plays for less than 15 seconds and the button has to be pressed almost continually for music to keep playing. My 6mo old can't press it herself yet and I'm not a contortionist to be able to do it while driving. Overall a cute idea but needs a couple of fixes."
2,Too expensive for what you really get,"The fish and star that hang down and the music & water sound it makes are just ordinary. In a way that is good because you dont want to oversimulate a baby's mind, however I see this as being a waste of money."
1,Danger,"My son is 4 months old. My baby loved this carseat toy. He would keep his hand on the little bar where the fishies hang. He cut his knuckle on the hard plastic white rim. I don't recommend buying this. If you do, please make sure that the white plastic does not have any sharp areas!! I plan on sending Baby Einstein an email with my concern."
3,just OK,"Other people were spot on when talking about how short the music intervals are. It is a right pain to have to reach over and find that TINY button to start the music again for another 15 seconds. Otherwise it's a hit here........ though I'd never think of putting it on a car seat, it's far too heavy in case of accident. I have it attached to the toy bar of my son's bouncy seat, and it's perfect there (not to mention easier for me to grab at that @#$%^ itty bitty music button.) He does love the way the animals float and jitter in the water, though, and squeals a streak when batting at the little toy beads and fish hanging from the bottom. I got this used for something like 3.50, and honestly think that was a fair price..... would have been ticked to pay nearly $15"
3,Not good enough for car seat but great for baby gym,I bought this because my baby started getting bored in his carrier. When I put it on I found that it was hard to get my baby in & out of the carrier and it gets in the way of the carrier's sun shade. I took it off & attached it to his baby gym & he LOVES it there. He is starting to crawl so he crawls under it & loves to grab all the dangling toys. I agree with others that the music is not long enough & the button for the music is too small & hard for a baby to find. I personally would purchase something else for your carrier or stroller but if you want to add some more entertainment to your baby gym this could be it.
2,I could have done without this one,"It really doesn't attach well to the car seat or stroller. I have a Graco Quattro Tour and the straps aren't long enough for either. My daughter does like the music but it doesn't play long enough and it is irritating to have to continue to activate (she isn't able to). I still get some use out of it though. She likes to pick it up, shake it and then toss it on the floor.*Update*I had to update this posting because this toy has become a big hit in the last few months. Around my daughter's first birthday she began to play with this. Now in the car she hits the button and plays the music over and over again. It is her favorite car toy. I'm actually glad I purchased it. Of course it still doesn't attach well to the car seat, but boy does it keep my daugher occupie. My opinion on this toy has totally changed."
2,Horrible design for attaching to a car seat,"My son liked the music of this toy, and would bat at the toys on the bar, but I couldn't get him into and out of his car seat with it attached without bopping him on the head. If the handle of the seat was all the way back, the toy was resting on his head when he was only three months old. He would cry every time I put him in the car, and I finally realized that he hated the feeling of the toy on his head as I put him into the seat."
2,boring,"cute to look at but not much to do. the music plays for too short of a time and the button is way to small for a baby to find, yet alone push by himself. hard to reach, just made my baby mad."
2,Needs Continuous Music Play Feature!!!,We actually strapped this toy inside the front of our stroller so our little guy could listen while we walked...fits nicely and he can hear the music just fine...BIGGEST DRAWBACK is that the songs are like 15-30 seconds long so you have to CONTINUOUSLY keep pushing the button for the music to keep playing....they should have designed it with a continuous play feature!Otherwise it is an ok enough toy for $13. Did not use in car seat because the straps were not long enough for my graco Pooh carseat and it is a safety hazard to have the carseat handle pulled forward for toy attachments while in the car.
3,Baby Neptune Carrier Toy Bar,"We bought this for our 1 month old daughter because she seemed to be getting bored and needed some sort of entertainment. I agree with all the reviews, that there needs to be another way to attach it to the car seat. It makes the car seat hard to carry as well as blocks the sun visor on snugride seats from being able to to cover most of the baby. The music selection is great, but WAYYYYYY to short. All but 1 songs seem as if they are shorter than 20 seconds long, hardly enough to catch her attention, and lose it since the song is already over. We are now looking into the toy that attaches to the seat and is controlled with a remote, so we arfen't turning around to find the button for the music every 30 seconds, this toy also plays longer songs."
3,"Cool idea, but.....","I loved the concept of this toy, but when I got it home I relized that it hung right where I carry my baby. When I carry the baby in the infant carrier, I hook my arm under the bar and carry it in the crook of my arm, and this toy kept me from being able to get my arm there comfortably. Now if you just carry it around with your hand, this is a great toy. But for me it was just a pain"
1,Disappointed!!!,"We saw this at Babies-r-us and fell in love with it, the music was perfect to calm a fussy baby BUT within a month all the water was gone. I never saw it leak but now empty all the characters are stuck together in the corner of the toy. My son will listen to the music but does not look at the toy any more. Highly disappointed in the product!"
4,Good attention getter for awhile...,"I bought this for my daughter when she was about 6 wks to entertain her while riding in the car. She was intrigued by it immediately. She's 4 months now & I still use it. The music seems to calm her down sometimes when nothing else would work. I think she may be getting bored with it now so I just bought another hanging Baby Einstein product.One thing I didn't like was how it attached to the car seat handle. As another reviewer stated, it's in the way when putting a baby in or out of the seat & seems to hang in an awkward position."
3,Disappointed with design...,"I love this toy BUT..... the way that the elastic velcro attaches to the carrier bar makes the toy hang perpendicular to baby's face (I use the Graco Snugride car seat). All that the baby can see are the fish that dangle from the bottom. I haven't found any other place that I can use this toy so that baby can see the ""water"" area."
2,water doesn't move,Glad I read the last review about not having any toy bars on the handle of the carseat while in the car and keeping the handle all the way back. A definite hazard if left in the forward position.Is the water supposed to move somehow? I've had to tilt the carseat (baby not in it) to get the floaties to move in the water. Is the water activated by pusing the button?
4,Good Low Budget Film,"It is a well done low budget film that is professionally done, as can obviously be seen by the intricate detail on the DVD box itself. Well worth the $15."
4,Excellent book for SQL first timers,"This is a *very* useful book. It explains the SQL language in a very clear and concise manner, covering the language in detail and offering excellent explanations. The book is also organized extremely well. The countless diagrams and screen shots are invaluable while working thru the examples.Having come to a point where I needed to learn SQL (and understand it), and fast, I picked this book out of 4 I was considering. I whole-heartedly believe I made the right decision. Not only did I learn SQL, but I understood it too.The book covers both MS Access and Oracle so if you're using either of those, and you need to learn the SQL language, this book is a great start! Heck, even if you won't be using Access or Oracle but have access to them for the purpose of the examples (I used Access for the examples but I needed to learn SQL for use with MySQL and MSSQL), this book should benefit you greatly."
5,SQL Fundamentals,"I found this to be a very good read on SQL. I learned SQL in a whirlwind fashion in college. I then began programming in Oracle and found that I could use some review of SQL. This book is the only one that I found that would fit the bill. It was just the re-calibration I was looking for. It does have a couple of typo issues (few) but, it wasn't in the code examples. Considering the speed that these books are produced to keep up with the technology, I think John Patrick did a good job with this book. I would give it high marks as an SQL reference. I haven't found one yet that compares."
3,Eh.,"It had preety easy review questions and nice solutions but the layout was kinda bad, it became a tedious read after a while and I wouldnt recomend it for a distance learning course just because it was not reader freindly. But if you plow through, it had good step by step instructions."
3,No packaging,"Got the unit in a box banging around with no packaging!Called vendor about it, was told next one would come the same way!If you like stuff that's been bounced off a UPS truck floor a dozen times, buy one of these. Good luck.Hope it works when I install it!"
4,Surprise! More Christmas Carols than suggested by tracklist,"One could be warned by the title 'Mixes', but in this case the balance goes mainly one way: instaed of 'You'd Be So Nice To Come Home To' you are surprised to hear ""O Tannenbaum, O Christmastree'! Other tracks are also not fitting with the mentioned titles, replaced by Christmas Carols.The next question is: how problematic can that be? Listen to the (Christmas-) music, to the (summary) solo's by Harrell and Farmer and the unknown very fine tromboneplayer, good orchestration, but most of all to the beautiful voice of Helen Merrill and all anger about the initial disappointment will fade away. Merely the song 'Nature Boy',in this case agreeing with the tracktitle, makes the CD more than worthwhile listening!What music can do..."
3,Drama about the innocence of youth and the depravity drug addicted parents,As the creator says at the beginning that people will love this movie or they will hate it. I haven't made up my mind yet. The young actress in the movie is superb.
3,Tideland: Gilliam's Biggest Dare,"Terry Gilliam gave me, and the cinematic world in general, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, for which I am forever grateful. He's been in this business for longer than I've been alive, and for someone like me to criticize him is like a mouse squeaking at a lion. What Tideland represents is a risky gamble on Gilliam's part. This movie touches on subject matter that will make stomachs turn and tongues wag, but it does so with a deft hand. I can't say I like this movie, I can't say I agree with Gilliam for even making this film, but I have to admire his courage for trying to address material as scandalous as this, and for injecting a touch of midnight black wit in the process. If you're curious, if this review has you wondering, pay your five bucks and see for yourself. I can't tell you it's a waste of money, but I can't say you'll come away pleased either. This movie's like life, you take risks and don't always enjoy the results."
5,Movie that's made for Blu-Ray,This is another masterpiece of the sick and twisted fantasy film maker Terry Gilliam. This movie is not for people with short attention spans it takes a while for things to start happening and to make sense but it is a great story with great visuals. If you love this film like I did you need to get your hands on the Blu-Ray version you wont regret it...this movie was made to be watched in Hi Def.
5,"Beautiful, Powerful and Disturbing","Gilliam enraged America by keeping the novel's subplot about pubescent sexual curiousity. Actually, the book goes a lot farther than a film could without being confiscated by the FBI.After the ho-hum Brothers Grimm, in which Gilliam seemed to be repeating himself, Tideland shows the director exploring fresh territory. I was not only surprised, but shocked by what he came up with.Jodelle Ferland is absolutely superb. Heart-wrenching performance.If you have an open mind, check this out. If you're any sort of right-winger, avoid avoid avoid."
3,"uhhh, well ...","I really enjoy Terry Gilliam's work, which is why I'm choosing the 3 star rating. I've watched it once so far and seen many elements which, by themselves in other applications or contexts, I'd gladly rate 11 stars. Jeff Bridges is, as always, a real delight. The composition of each scene is nearly breath-taking, the rythm is flawless, and just about every other technical aspect of the film is far above reproach.The story has me ... distressed. I think I need to watch this a few more times before I get past the ""freaked out"" stage that I'm in at the moment. Perhaps then I'll re-rate it. Definitely NOT for everyone, but I want to assimilate this film, even if it means fighting some new compulsion to bathe in diesel fuel or nitroglycerin or something equally soothing.Terry Gilliam has no equal to be sure, and in this film he dives very deeply."
4,I just don't know,"I just don't know how to feel about this film.The performances are all first rate. The story evokes many emotions and presents so much that is disturbing. You may find it hard to admit that you have enjoyed this film.Mr. Gilliam has again presented a work that will reckon you to your core. It flows like the random thoughts of a daydreaming mind bent on completing a single thought that keeps itself just out of reach.The young actress, Jodelle Ferland gave an absolutely remarkable performance; especially for a youngster of her age. Casting her was perhaps the most brilliant stroke in this film.All this having been said, your average individual is not likely to enjoy this work. The story is so distrubing, it is nearly impossible to see the hope and good being in any of it.The film is beautifully shot. It has a quality about it that is somewhere between a dream and waking state.I recommend you risk viewing this film. It grows on you..,."
2,Interesting...,"...I liked this movie and I didn't like this movie.Throughout the movie, I was getting a little tired of Jodelle Ferland's acting, it just seemed like it was too over-the-top too often, I would've liked Jeff Bridges to be in the movie more and I think that a lot of this movie was weird just for weird's sake.I really enjoyed how this movie was shot. I also enjoyed all the creativity and imagination used. The characters were interesting and unpredictable.Like I said: I liked it and I didn't like it."
1,90 Minutes of Pointless Conversation Between a Girl and Her Doll Heads,"Well, not much to say here. The story revolves around a child who has two addicted parents. Both of them die early in the movie, leaving the child to herself in a remote, worn down, shell-of-a-house.From there, the movie features the child talking to her doll heads. Actually, she mumbles a lot, saying nothing of importance.If you find 90 minutes of a girl talking to her dolls fun, this film is for you. I found it incredibly dull, to the point where my mind wandered early and often. There was nothing going on, and nothing important being said (unless you were the child's doll).This movie is so dull the director opens up before hand stating ""you might not like this movie."" He was right.It's not that I didn't ""get this film."" It was horrendous. The accents and acting were porr, the scenary was nothing knew to those of us who live outside of a mega-city, and the story was non-existent.Avoid this film at all costs."
1,Not sure how good the movie was,"Well, like the title says, I have no clue how good the movie was, because when I opened up the brand new factory sealed DVD, it was missing disc one, which actually contains the movie. I purchased it brand new from Amazon. I am posting this as a ""heads up"" to those folks that might buy a lot of stuff when its on sale and not get around to opening it until a couple months later. You probably want to open this up right away if you purchase it, to verify that you actually received both discs, so you can still return it and get a refund within the 30 day return timeframe if you didn't.Yes, I know some people will get upset by my review claiming I should only review the movie, but this is the PRODUCT review section, and the ""product"" was actually missing from the packaging and not included, so..."
5,Love it!,"This movie is not for everyone, but I loved it. If you like Terry Gilliam and movies which are not by the book, then give it a try!!"
3,"Brilliant, but boring","You've read the story.All I can add is that Gilliam and the child actor, make this a unique movie. I was fascinated by the girl for over an hour, even though little happens.Really for 2 hours nothing happens except when the mother dies and the train explodes. In between we are treated to great scenes and great acting, but there isn't much else. I got bored after 80 minutes or so.Very dark look into the fantasy world of a disturbed little girl."
1,Boring,"I really wanted to like this movie but I couldn't even finish it watching it. While I found what I did see to be rather trippy it was, to me anyway, really boring. I liked all the characters, at least the ones that were living through the movie, and enjoyed the scenery but the movie itself just dragged. Maybe it got better as it went on based on the reviews calling it brilliant but after about a hour I just couldn't take it any more."
4,Sometimes critics are wrong...Jaliza Rose!,"This film mirrored Pan's Labryinth alot. A little girl in a bad world...she fantasizes about escaping. The film is a visual feast, very surrealistic. Jeff Bridges rotting with flies, then being embalmed, how can it get better than that?Brendan Fletcher gives the best acting performance of 2006."
3,"Great Directing, Acting, For what?","Disturbing for the sake of disturbing maybe? Trying to go the lengths as far as social permaters?Yeah, very cool.Did that..But then what?What's the point here?\What are we we meant to take away from this story/scipt?This is emptiness personified. Is that meant to mean anything?Or are we all meant to represent taxidermed corpses?How profound is that?\This is really good cinema and really dumb ideas.If you can even fathom the script in the first place.The lead actress mouths incomprehensible somethings.We are meant to supply the relevency,.Sorry,...Graded off for the script that tries to be mythic, but is just horrific..\soundtrack is oksupplies at least some drama..BEK"
5,Not for everybody,"But guess what most people are too uptight anyway! This movie is Disturbing, make no mistake. It's a very artistic piece, and people who called it trash really have no insight to the human psyche, nor can they think as a child would.If you think about the type of environment that the girl grew up in, with no one who paid any attention to her, you would see how desperate she was for friends. The loss of each of her dolls heads played a very significant role in her developmemnt towards reality, and her grudging acceptance of it. The loss of Mystique was a very significant part, because it had shown that she was leaving her imagination behind, and she was now slowly moving towards her reality.This was a beautifully done movie, that was disturbing to many, because many refuse to see the truth in it, that the charcter of Feliza-Rose, was a very real little girl. And the girl who played her, was absolutely superb."
3,Rent It,"A strange fantasy movie with plenty of drama and clever casting. In the end, I'd say it is worth a rent rather than a buy and while i don't mind having this in my collection I wouldn't go out of my way to replace it if it were lost, stolen or broken."
1,"This is a review of the dvd, not the film","This region 1 dvd really dropped the ball. The correct aspect ratio of the movie is 2.35:1, which is a dramatically wide picture. This dvd is 1.85:1, which has quite a bit of the picture cropped off. Nowhere on the package does it mention this, so if you're thinking you're getting to see the movie the way Gilliam intended, you are not. I can think of no reason this was done, and it is a true disservice to anyone who purchases this dvd. I hope a new edition is released in the future, but this version is a total waste of money."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DVD!,"Gilliam wanted this dvd released at 2.25.1 aspect ratio and instead ThinkFilm is distributing it at 1.77.1, cropping out image that Gilliam wants you to see! To make matters worse Gilliam gave them the correct aspect ratio and ThinkFilm decided to against it. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DVD! Wait for a better edition which ThinFilm claims there will be!"
5,A Masterful Story and Film,"The lengthy, literate review by Dein captures the real and wonderful essence of this film. While some scenes are indeed grisly, they are absolutely faithful to the novel and never overdone. And although this film and its delightful images are from Terry Gilliam's camera, the novel with its bizarre story is by Mitch Cullin, a very important young novelist. Read his recent A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND for a sedate and thoughtful treatment of old age, a contrast to TIDELAND in many engrossing ways."
3,"gilliam is a genius, but that doesnt always mean his work is....","The movie is original, to say the least. I haven't read the novel, but the woman who preserves people close to her, and the epileptic boy who envisions him captain of the wheat fields, are shockingly hysterical. I had fun watching the movie, just for pure shock value, and I do think it is creative. But I won't ever watch it again. I wouldn't say it has any repeat value. Now, as for Gilliam's 12 Monkeys, I could watch a film like that anytime."
2,One Girl's Journey,"This movie was similar to Pan's Labrynth. We have this girl who is living in deplorable conditions, but uses her imagination to get through each day. It is not full of special effects and exteme fantasy like Pan's Labrynth though.The characters are just plain wierd, and everyone in this story seems mentally ill. There is no real plot to the movie at all and it's just about this strange girl trying to find her place in the world. No real conclusion at the end, so who knows what happens to her. The characters are just weird for the sake of being wierd and nothing else. The movie is just missing something..like a good plot.You can either find the movie boring and lame, which it mostly is... or get tricked by its wierdness and believe it to be some masterpiece created by a true visionary; take your pick."
3,Visually stunning but too damn creepy,The film was very well acted and visually stunning (as are most Gilliam films). But overall i felt like it was just TOO creepy. Couldn't really handle some of the stuff that went down and for that reason i will probably never watch it again. Good thing Amazon exists and i only had to pay 4 bucks for it
5,A great mystery/love story!,"Widowed artist Sarah McAllister leaves San Francisco, and buys a castle on the Scottish coast. There, she meets Ross Fleming, handsome member of the local gentry and book publisher. However, Sarah's castle harbors some terrible secrets, as well as joy: a ghost is out to rob Sarah of her new-found happiness that she has found with Ross."
5,Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!1,I saw this movie a few weeks ago on TV and I fell in love with it... the Scotish views are beautiful and the story is a beautiful love story that made me want to move to Scotland and find my Mr. right...I am definetly buying this film... this movie is a keeper :)I recomend to watch it with someone whom you really love...
4,Excellent Quality Flatware,"After looking for a timeless flatware design for some time, I purchased one place setting of this collection to evaluate. The quality of the polishing is high, and after repeated washings over many months the setting shows no signs of wear. My only objection to this collection is the large size of the settings. To me, everything was one size too large. The teaspoon seemed like a tablespoon, and the smaller fork was 7 inches long, the larger 8. The knife is 9 inches long and very slender."
3,sensationalist slave story in the bad old days,Here's a blast from the past for me. My tastes have changed somewhat over the years so it's been a while since I've read this but it does have the power to stick in my mind due to the rather sensationalist story of (eventual) love between Viking captor and Briton(?) slave girl.
4,One of her earlier works,"An only child, Brenna strived to be the son her father never had. Instead she is offered as a bride to Garrick, the son of a Viking chieftain. To her horror, her family is betrayed by the chieftain. She is given to his son as his slave, not as his wife. Garrick does not trust women. His betrothed had left him for a fat, wealthy merchant. Owning a firebrand such as Brenna does not make him feel any better about the fairer sex. But Brenna affects him more than any other woman. Could it be he is losing his heart to her?This book is well written with well developed characters. But these characters are so distrusting of each other that you truly wonder if they really have a chance."
2,Ugh,"Wow this was not very uplifting. I think if there had been one more rape I would have put the book down. I know that the Vikings were actually much worse than what was written but maybe it should not be a subject for a romance novel. There wasn't much that was romantic about this book. So what if he had his mother make her a dress! I also found it impossible that Brenna was the only one of the slaves that was in the least upset about their situation. Murder, rape, beatings, slavery. Sounds great to me. Sign me up!! Just a bad topic and a less than attractive hero."
5,white-hot!,"this is jl's best book. garrick is what makes me love vikings. jl, please, more viking books!"
3,a good read,"Johanna Lindsey's stories are like an old friend - always good to catch up with - enjoy, relax and be transformed somewhere else!"
3,Good but not great,"I love Johanna Lindsey novels, but I found this one lacking. I just never really got around to liking the hero. He was stubborn and unrelenting. The plot wasn't anything superb either. I know that during the time period women weren't considered much more than property, but I don't get the whole ""rape"" thing as romance. I have read the entire viking triology and I must say the other two books are a lot better than this one."
2,Not One Of Lindsey's Best,"This book was definetly a disappointment. I don't know about other people's idea of romance. But when the hero rapes the heroine that isn't exactly a great ingredient for love. The characters were interesting and the story flowed well, but I couldn't see why Brenna and Garrick loved each other. I've read all of Lindsey's books, and if you like her work too, I recommend that you pass this one on."
4,A different time,I like the quality of the writing but my preference is for Regency Period romances. This novel is well written withbelievable characters. I enjoy Miss Lindsey's writing but I find this time period very barbaric. It's still worth readingas she captures the wildness of the times perfectly.
3,Annoying at times.,"I absolutely love the second book to this series, but this one was quite annoying! I had to stop reading and come back to it so many times because I got so annoyed. There was little romance in it; just more of their bickering and problems. The Vikings were portrayed to the extreme in here, which I found annoying. I feel like Lindsey overdid the Vikings and their bickering and fighting in here. I couldn't wait to get to the ending parts where they would finally stop fighting and be together. A little disappointed because I read the second book before this one and was expecting a lot more."
1,Very disturbing...,"I have read several Lindsey books and enjoyed them thoroughly, but this book (and the other two of this trilogy) disturbed me a great deal. The heroines are repeatedly raped, kept on chains, told they are worthless. It was horrible. I kept waiting for the ""moment"" in every romance where the hero realizes the error of his ways and changes into a likeable human being. These Vikings did not change. Even though they finally admit they love their women, they continue to display chauvinistic attitudes toward all other women in general. I did not enjoy these books at all and will be getting rid of them as soon as possible."
1,DISAPPOINTMENT,"This was the most horrible romance novel that I have read in a while. There is nothing romantic about this novel which is filled with rape scenes and NOT love scenes. The heroine Brenna is annoying and totally unlikable with her over inflated pride and childish tempertantrums. The hero's character (Garrick) tries to be the strong sexy male lead, but why bother when there's not a loving, courageous heroine?????????? I give it one star because it set the stage for the sequel HEARTS AFLAME which was a lot better."
4,enjoyable,"I always enjoy this author, great for any romantics. Curl up on the lounge and escape back in time for a while"
5,Della Carlock,"I love anything by Johanna Lindsey. I am not sure, but I thing I have most of her Books. If there are any new ones, let me know. I have one or two of Dana James, I would like to see some of her books."
2,Jumped the shark,"I enjoyed the first half of the book where Lady Brenna is taken to a new place and is introduced to the hero. But there were so many sub plots I felt that some of them felt rushed or wrapped up really fast. When she gets taken by the other Viking clan, I did not like the passage of time or the reaction of the hero."
5,Excellent,This book is classic Johanna Lindsay. Fires of winter is not my favourite but it is still well worth the money.
4,"The Scariest Stories You've Ever Heard, Part I",I remembered having this book when I was younger and I don't know what happened to it. I found it online and I couldn't pass up the opportunity to revisit the memories. This product was delivered in good condition and in a timely manner. I also bought part 2.
5,Good for a late night around campfire........,"These scary stories are all very good, great for campfire!! If you have the nerve......."
2,Donald J Pliner Kilt2 Ankle Strat wedge shoe,This is an attractive shoe but there is a problem with the 2 side straps. I have a medium fit foot and these 2 straps do not sit on the foot but kind of stand up in the air. I'm going to have a shoe mender shorten these as I do like the appearance of the shoe and it is comfortable on the foot.
5,my favorite shoes ever,"Had I known they would not be available forever, I would have bought enough pairs to last a lifetime. Aside from the obvious quallty and comfort, they are extremely versatile. I get compliments almost every time I wear them. LOVE these shoes!"
4,Almost perfect,"This boot was a great purchase. It fits nicely and is beautiful. However, the only problem I have with it is the heel seems to be made out of plastic rather than rubber. So when I wear it, I have to be careful not to slip on smooth or wet surfaces. I've had another pair of boots from Skechers that had the same problem and I fell on that one. Now, I'm being extra cautious with this one."
3,"gorgeous boots, runs a lil small","I fell in love with these boots as soon as I spotted them. I usually wears 5.5 but I decided to get a size 6 so I could wear socks with them for the colder weather. However, even though it's a size 6M i ordered, it actually ran a little smaller than expected, and I couldn't get comfortable in them at all unless I don't wear anything else on my feet. Had to return them, not sure if I want replacement yet since they are more narrow than I expected and I have rather broad feet."
3,Fun read but flawed cookbook,"Roman Cookery is a great read for the fact that Graves provides fascinating insight into ancient cooking techniques and this portion of the text is well researched and presented. As a cookbook however, Roman Cookery has its flaws. A lack of serving sizes is definitly the most striking of these omissions but a general lack of description and explanation makes obtaining the desired end a difficult process. While a couple dishes turned out great a majority were either overcooked or needed more or less of the ingredients to make the meal work (not spices or other opinionated deviations but the neccesary steps such as the amount of flour needed to make dough as opposed to batter, for example).All in all I would recommend picking up the book to experiment with some side dishes here and there and to read the historical discourse on culinary techniques but don't try to plan a week of meals out of the book or else you may find yourself frustrated in the process."
4,Nuggets of Inspiration,"Pathways to Peace is a beautiful book both in design and content. The editor has pulled together brief writings from around the globe, ancient to contemporary. They show that in every tradition, human beings have hoped and worked for peace. I found the book easy to hold and read, with nuggets of wisdom for daily inspiration. The book reminds us that peace is possible and hope lives on."
1,What a rip-off!,"I ordered a copy of this DVD. Not only did I not receive it as promised, when I contacted them to get my money back, they gave me some lame excuse & avoided giving me my money back. Do yourself a favor & buy from someone else....maybe some shady guy on the street corner."
5,Another CD Of Spiritual Piano Virtuosity !,"""Islands Of Light"" and ""Ascension"" are inarguably the two most spiritually edifying CDs of piano virtuosity that I have ever heard. Will Tuttle is a benevolent and musically gifted musician who writes and plays his own songs. The message behind his music is universal peace and conciliation; reverence for all life; and the grandeur of this life and the next. His piano music is solacing and it assuages the soul and the mind. Mr. Tuttle cares deeply about the earth and all creatures. All of his CD's are musically resplendent and Mr.Tuttle is a bona fide purveyor of peace, optimism and eternal life."
3,Bigger Words for Bigger Kids,"I bought this video for my 16 month old daughter who absolutely loves tapes 1 & 2. After watching tape 3 just once, I don't believe that my daughter is ready for words like ""bulldozer"" and ""helicopter"". While there are some easier words like ""fish"", ""arm"" and ""wagon"", I would not recommend this level unless your child has mastered at least most of the words on levels 1 and 2. Like the earlier tapes, level 3 features great classical music, live animal shots, bright objects and friendly children's faces to hold your child's attention, but don't be in a rush to leave tapes 1 & 2 behind."
2,Borderline for KLR650,"I used this on a 2,000 mile trip with a KLR650 on the back of a 2005 Tacoma. Getting the bike loaded deformed the metal a little bit so after the first use I put a block under the end to support it while loading and unloading. For the price it did a fair job considering other carriers can get up to $500 and more. I'm sure with a lighter bike it would do much better. For larger bikes you might find it blocks the taillights so consider getting some magnetic or strap on taillights with it (typically used when towing another vehicle)."
1,False Description!!,This product is not compatible with motorcycles. When it arrives to your house it comes with a warning stating to only load dirtbikes of 450cc or higher. Which it states it adjusts to large and small bikes up to 500lbs. Completely deceiving and I am returning the item immediately.
2,Motorcycle carrier,What a great idea to be able to use a 2 inch hitch to carry a motorcycle or scooter. I assembled the product and it looks like it was going to work really well to transport my scooter. However.........the problem I had with this product was that there was no way to attach the scooter to the hitch. The hitch needed two tall bars on the inside about the height of the tailgate to attach the scooter and keep it from falling into the tailgate. Without these bars or something in between the hitch and truck..........my scooter fell inward and got all scratched up. Using straps from the truck to the scooter held the scooter in place but again scratched up the paint in 3 places as it still was only balanced on the track and something needed to be in between the tailgate and the bike. I returned the product as any bump in the road caused the scooter fall back and forth into the tailgate and scratch the paint.
5,An HR companion,"Whether you starting out your HR career, transitioning to a new HR role or looking for an new HR twist, HR from the Heart will be a trusted companion. It's real, honest, informative and fun. I recommend it to all my collegues!"
5,Excellent and inspiring,"Libby and Martha have written an excellent book reflecting the learnings of many years of HR Experience. For those with lots of experience and a caring heart, you will reflect on your HR career and say ""hey, that's what I've learned in 20 years."" There are good ideas on how to be a strategic and caring leader that will help you be more successful.For those newer to HR, the book will provide insights that may prevent you from making the same mistakes that us older folks have made. There are also insights on managing your HR career.I would also recommend the book to CEO and other high-level Execs that 1) want more from their HR department or 2) don't know what they want or what HR can be.The book is well written and inspirational. Thanks to the authors."
2,"Or ""Self-serving accounts from a left-leaning pathologist""","Dr. Wecht will skew the facts presented in his book to justify his own liberal viewpoint. He dismisses some hard-to-dispute facts to serve his criminal-pandering ideology. His intolerance of ""radical rightwingers"" is typical of a defense-paid expert; his star-struck, namedropping accounts (a la Lance Ito) are too nauseating to stomach.You'll only need to read the first chapter of this book, depicting his take on the evidence presented in O.J. trial, to be convinced that Dr. Wecht is just like any other highly paid expert--he'll say just about anthing for a buck.Read it if you are a criminal-loving bleeding heart. Skip it if your a thinking person with high blood pressure."
2,Ego Trip,"It's a quick read, so if you're looking for some fluff to read on the bus, I guess it's bearable. But if you're interested in learning anything about forensic science from a master, don't bother. Unfortunately Dr. Wecht seems to be more fascinated with himself than he is with the science and technology that make him what he is."
1,"Self-serving, liberal, and with misstated facts","I did not find anything to like about this book. Even Wecht's writing style is less than good. However, most importantly, he has misstated facts, the most glaring one immediately coming to mind is that there was a small amount of blood in the OJ Bronco. Careful review of the forensic evidence in the case clearly reveals that there were large amounts of blood in the Bronco, although, admittedly, this was poorly presented by the prosecution. An individual at Wecht's level should KNOW and RESEARCH his facts completely before opining about such cases. Further, the thought of a second killer in OJ is not seriously considered by anyone who reviews the case with care. The American public deserves better! His treatment of the other cases he chose is, in my opinion, no better than that of OJ."
1,Ridiculous!,"I found this book to be a waste of my time. The fist in many book that I have read about the O.J. Trial.I found the first review from ""Reader in Somerville, N.J."" to be a waste of time also since they put the same review...word for word in every review they give. How can that help you with a book when a person just repeats thier views over & over for every book. Answer=It can't."
5,Beautiful and comfortable,"What else can I say. It looks and feels great. I am using it on my Epiphone Les Paul and am quite pleased. It distributes the guitar weight well and is comfortable to wear for long periods of time.It is also very handy in that I clip my Dean Stack in a Box right to the strap which makes it more accessible for adjustment. Because of the width of the band, the Stack site solidly and securely."
4,Beautiful Shoulder Strap,.I like the shoulder strap allot.Though it is ment for a guitar with two hookup points.Fortunatly I had what I needed to connect it to the neck of the guitar.Just a little fact I over looked because I liked the Rose
2,Not My Favorite,"I did not care for this scent and ended up returning it. The scent was not as described in my opinion. It was a bit pungent and not pleasant. Maybe a hint of fruit if you really ""smelled"" for it but overall, the smell was intrusive and not welcoming."
4,"Solid Content, Overlap with Digital Logic IC Pocket Book, Pricey","I purchased this book and 'Digital Logic IC' Pocket Book authored by RM Marston. The two were first published in the same year (1996)with a considerable amount of overlap between the two. The chapter titles are almost identical. Most if not all of the charts and circuits are the same. This book is better only for the larger print and white pages instead of the crammed type and yellow pages of the 'Digital Logic IC' Pocket Book. The flip side if you want to save cash, plan to purchase just one of these editions and can tolerate the smaller typeface and yellow tint pages purchase the 'Digital Logic IC' for about $22.00 instead of this books pricey cost of $49.99.Maybe the publisher thought they could increase their profits repackaging the text into another cover? I don't know."
3,OK - Not great,"The book is good for examples of using various SWING components. For new comers to Java SWING, however, it does a poor job of explaining what the components are and when to use them. It makes references to AWT but if you don't know AWT, it doesn't help. I found more useful information in that area from Sun's website. Sun's website also does a better job of explaining SWING's architecture and how it fits into MVC architecture."
3,"Decent, but sorely lacking as a tutorial","This book is an alright reference, but a poor tutorial. The problem is that there is no examples of a complete GUI, especially real life examples. Sadly, this a a flaw in many other Java books, Head First Java is particularily bad in this regard.What these types of books need is a full blown example, one that has a menu bar, tool bar, and multiple items on one or more panels, complete with layout and listeners.A book like this must be a nightmare for a total beginners, having to piece together info from all over the book."
1,Not very definitive at all,"This book is a total waste of time and money. I am a programmer by profession and needed a book I could keep handy for a reference. I was in the process of learning Swing (already a Java programmer) and I needed something I could use as both a reference and a tutorial. This book does neither very well at all. As a reference, it does a poor job of documenting the available interfaces. The examples are trite, confusing, incomplete, and in some cases wrong. Do not waste your time with this rag, after several attempts to use it I finally gave up in frustration and pitched it in the trash, where it belongs."
5,EXCELLENT,"Along the lines of Lydia's ""This December It's One More and I'm Free"". Excellent album, but not easy to track down so snatch this up today."
4,Better View Rising Moon,"If you like the song ""Water's Edge"", that doesn't mean you'll like this CD. Now if you savor this band's unique sound, by all means you will enjoy the CD. But do not expect every song to be the same as it's single. Overall I think this is the group's best release. (Not to mention that Alida Marroni and Kerri Mack are both very talented singers and attractive women!)"
5,A nice addition to your desktop,"A very well put together piece of software that runs nicely on my desktop. Would like to see this edition in tablet form. Has many nice map applications. Dictionaries, commentaries from various sources,Tons and tons of reading materials. A definite buy."
1,Eternity,"I'm Sorry To Say, I'm Very Dissatisfied With This Product....It Is A Fake In My Opinion.....Dosen't Smell Anything Like Eternity.Very Much A Easte Of My Money!!!!!"
4,excellent portrayal,"This movie is a multi star movie. Rajesh Khanna has done very few multi star movies. To his credit he has single handedly made a no of movies successful. In this movie he has Dharamendra and Vinod Khanna as his co-stars. However, his portrayal of the character is most outstanding. The movie has a good story but the editing leaves much desired. The music by Laxmikant Pyarelal could have been better - only one song picturized on Rajesh Khanna is good and there is a Holi song which is remembered. Rajesh Khanna excels in his performance and only Dharamendra could withstand his powerful portrayal. This movie is well mounted but has something missing to be a classic but a must see for Rajesh Khanna and Dharamendra fans."
3,dissapointing,"Having read another Marc Barasch work, Field Guide to the Compassionate Life, I expected a more in depth analysis. I thought the beginning chapters might be an introduction, but the method used in this book remained superficial to the issues. Barasch recounts someone's dream, and then comments on what it might or might not mean. Over and over and over, the formula is repeated. Although the last third of the book explored topics more to my satisfaction, I could not shake the impression that each sequence was a 'Shel Silverstein cartoon', where someone in a bar relates their dream to an intent listener, who is deflated when the dreamer concludes with the image of a giant donut."
4,like trying to climb out of a sand-hole,"I have had this book for 20 yrs approx. I love the premise of this book of deep time- the unfathomability and truer reality if we did grasp deep time looking back into it and it hand in hand with Nature. Truly fascinating when cave-men who we were much longer than before the neolithic age.But the half dozen times I have sat down to read it I end up feeling like an an ant trying to climb out from the bottom of a large hole whose sides are lined with fine dry sand. So around 80 pages I go tumbling down. The next time I pick the book up needs to be started from the beginning again which is another reason to delay yet another assault. Highly ironic when "" Breakingthrough"" all about incremental time! !!I can and have persevered through other books as dense but requires planning like knowing you will be stuck in an airport forever waiting for connecting flight etc....It is an intriuging fascinating book so far."
2,Leaves a lot to be desired,"Very, very basic and not a good place to start if there is a true interest in learning the language; however, if you just need to get by with a few words and phrases this will be sifficient."
5,Amazing,"I wanted to purchase a copy of ""WingNuts"" for the longest time. I stumbled upon this set of games that included WingNuts! Other great games such as Bugdom and CroMag Rally were included. These three games alone are well worth the price of Ten for X. This is one of the best bargains around."
5,FABULOUS WIGGLY FUN,"you MUST get this book--it is terrific! the rhyme is very catchy, the pictures are colorful and fun and i dare a toddler to not like it. my son (19 months old) requests this book several times a day--he can't get enough of it. the story is just short enough to keep a toddler's attention while being long enough to tell a tale. HIGHLY recommended!!!"
4,Very cute bedtime story,"My daughter got this from a book subscription her grandfather gave her and it's one of our favorite bedtime stories (especially for those nights when you want something a little shorter!). Like another reviewer, we usually wiggle to each page. The illustrations are nice - a mix of real photos and sketched elements - nothing fancy but cute and not ugly like a lot of children's books can be.It's got a nice rhythm - I can see what some reviewers mean about it being awkard but it really isn't - it's not matchy rhymes like a poem but more like a conversation."
3,Wiggle Review,"I was rather disappointed in the book. The rhyme and rhythm of the verse were difficult at times. I was expecting it to be more fun, something that kids could mimic."
3,More for women...,"This is a good video for women. The techniques are easy and work, but as there mostly for grabs, etc... and don't deal with fighting or punching, which is what is what an attacker would use on a male victum, it's more better suited for women. Also what happens when you release the attacker from a lock or control situation? Also it doesn't deal with the attacker having a weapon."
5,EXCELLANT,If you love to cook with spices you must use Whole Spices! The product is outstanding and the cost is great. Compared to buying in small bottles--you can't compare for price.The Garlic Pepper is our favorite. We go through a bag a month!
2,Lackluster,"Although there are some interesting details in the book, it failed to hold my interest, as I thought the author got a little too thorough in her description of what took place in Lyon.What I'll grant her is that, toward the end, when Barbie is in Bolivia, the story gets interesting. It gets even better when he is extradited to France, where justice catches up with him."
4,He looks great,Arrived with minor damage to his fingers and an extra fold in his torso. Once assembled he looked great for Pirate Adventure night. We used him as a prop for pictures. Perfect.
4,Great cover for the price,it was only $7 dollars and it's pretty durable. i got it so it wouldn't slip out of my hand and so far i haven't dropped it!
4,Not perfect but very attractive,"Seeing my iPhone in its case some thought the iPhone 4 came in blue and were very excited. It is a good looking case. However, the plastic covers the on/off and volume buttons so you have to push a bit harder than you would otherwise. Outside of that minor issue, I think the case is just about right."
1,Don't waste your money. Very uncomfortable.,These insoles could be filled with dancing ponies and I still wouldn't recommend them. They are very uncomfortable.
3,Ouch my feet!,Its a massage at first because it stimulates your foot in was way not routine which one can say is a massage but you'll come to find out its more pain than anything else. You may enjoy if you dont use often?
3,Accounting for Blur,"The book reads more like an accountant's take on the band. Most of the book deals with the business relationship between the managers and the band and doesn't really get into the ideas behind the songs. Nor does 3862 Days tell an interesting story. I would have liked to have read more behind the scenes road stories instead.I did like the references to bands such as Boo Radleys, The Cardiacs and Wire who influenced and were influenced by Blur.Also, the author had an annoying way of writing ""none the less"" on virtually every page.[DW]"
5,Excellent Chronicle of Blur,"Quoting another review: A must for Blur fans. For the many years that I loved/saw Blur, I was completely unaware of the turmoil going on behind the scenes, the struggles with record companies, the grueling tours, the lost money, the personal problems, yet in spite of it all, they continued to evolve and change and release fantastic music. Individually, they continue to do so to this day. Of course, additionally this book talks about the Oasis/Blur rivalry, but it's a small part of the big picture. What I like most about this bio is that it doesn't read like a sensationalist tabloid. (It reminds me just bit of ""Up and Down with the Rolling Stones,"" though not nearly as much debauchery.) There are tons of passages quoted by bandmembers themselves, and overall it's an intelligently-written, humorous look at one of the best bands ever. It gives me new insight when hearing their records, and now my daughter's a big fan of ""Park Life."" (ai yi yi!)"
2,Works Wonderfully Well Until Ratchet Fails,"This ""one-handed"" paper towel dispenser works exactly as advertised, until the ratchet mechanism fails. The ratchet tensions the paper towel roll so that you can tear off one or many sheets using only one hand. However, I have installed two of these, and both times the nylon ratchet failed after about a year of daily kitchen use.That said, I am nevertheless purchasing yet another replacement dispenser, because (1) it fits the holes already drilled beneath my kitchen cabinet, and (2) when it is working, it works really well. It is especially appreciated by the post-stroke member of my household who cooks but has the use of only one hand."
5,no question - the best you can buy at any price,"There is nothing else to even consider, this one is the best looking and most functional unit available at any price. It does make a small ""clicking"" sound, but that is the ratchet mechanism that allows you to tear off a towel one-handed (without unrolling the whole deal:-)."
1,Noisy Towel Holder?,"I bought this paper towel holder for my office thinking, what's the real difference between this and anything else out there. The difference is, that this holder makes a terrible grinding noise when you pull the towels off. The mechanism that holds the roll on is designed such that it makes a clicking noise when you pull the towel, but when a roll is on and the holder is attached to a wall it tends to make this guttural rumbling sound when pulled. My colleagues demanded that we replace the holder because it bothered them all so much."
2,Not a perfect tear,I bought two of these items. One works the way it is suppose to and the other one does not. Not worth trying to send it back. Guess you can get a lemon in anything.
2,Worked well for a few months,I've had this product for a year and a half. It's become loose and wobbly. It no longer holds any more tension than a regular paper towel dispenser.
2,Doesn't last,"Not much to add except that I also thought it was great until it broke after a couple of months. There are other manufacturers with similar products, so I'd recommend shopping around for one of those instead.Great idea, shoddy implementation."
2,Works Great - For a while,I purchased this in April - it stopped working in October. The concept is great - but the execution results in an unreliable product. I installed the holder vertically - and as some have stated it makes noise. I found the noise acceptable since it was providing a purpose. Now its pretty quiet - and not working as designed. The internal mechanism is made of a cheap plastic. When I took the unit apart - I found a broken part. I will look for a similar product - but from another manufacterer.
5,works,[+] looks nice[+] does not use counter space[-] can't tear paper with one hand. might be the type of paper towel.
2,Great While They Last,"I have two of these units in my house and while they function great at first, they really to suffer with long-term usage. After a few weeks you notice the effectiveness drop, and after a few months it's obvious that it's not functioning nearly as well as you had hoped it would. Finally, after a couple years it really is barely more than a standard towel holder with just the slightest bit of resistance. If I had rated this product within the first month of owning it, I would have given it 4-5 stars, but for a product that gets wall mounted, it should be more durable."
3,"Its ok, but great price!","This is great to keep paper towels handy, but when you grab one, the thing is quite loud & annoying sounding. It was a great price though & will work fine. Screws are long though, so they will definitely poke through the cabinet unless you put it in a wall."
2,GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,THIS ITEM I PURCHASED ABOUT 4 MONTHS AGO AND IT WORKED FOR ABOUT A MONTH AS STATED BUT AFTER THAT YOU CAN'T COUNT ON IT WORKING PROPERLY AS WHEN YOU USE JUST ONE HAND TO RIP OFF A SINGLE SHEET IT DOESN'T STOP AND SO YOU'LL NEED TWO HANDS TO ONE TO PULL THE PAPER AND ONE TO STOP IT OTHERWISE YOU WILL END UP TAKING OFF THE WHOLE ROLL. IT WAS WONDERFUL WHILE IT LASTED BUT NOW IT'S NO DIFFERENT FROM ANY OTHER TOWEL HOLDER...
4,works well but a little noisy,The product works as advertised: You can tear off a paper towel with one hand with no ripping.The only downside is that it is a bit noisy due to the ratchet system used.Decent design in terms of both functionality and appearance.Note: I have mine oriented horizontally. The experience may be different if mounted vertically.
1,"Cheap Plastic Ratchet, Broken Within 2 Months","I had an all-plastic type of this paper towel holder (Easi Tear), and it lasted 5 years. I was hoping to get the same thing, but it is no longer available. I bought this one thinking it would be the same thing. It is mostly metal, but the integral part of the ratchet is made of plastic. It is now broken, two months after I bought it. Buyer beware, I should have known it was garbage by the price, I think I paid more for the all-plastic one years ago."
5,Great design!,"I never thought I'd feel compelled to write about a paper towel rack but this thing is great! What a nice convenience for tearing off one piece of towel at a time with one hand. And it saves wasted towels. Wonderfully simple, ratchet design. I've installed mine horizontally, under a cabinet but it would work equally well vertically."
2,"Noisy, Low quality materials used throughout","Just finished removing this from my cabinets. I was too loud, we were afraid it would wake the kids.Additionally, it looks nice from a distance, but up close you can see the pitting and poor finish.The price was right, and we didn't expect much, but it just isn't something we can use."
3,It's fine.,"It's a big improvement over what we were using, so in the end we're happy. It's good value for the price, but the ratchet system is a little weird and very noisy. The construction is ok, but it sags when a large paper roll is on there.All in all, good buy, but probably would not buy a second one. I think there's a better product out there for not much more money."
5,Great design!,Works great for grabbing a towel one handed...just the right tension! Works really well with select-a-size Bounty towels. Gets a little tight at the end of the roll but not a big issue.
5,Perfect Tear Chrome Paper Towel Holder,"WORKS GREAT! Well worth the cost. I have it in my ""man-cave"" .. now the wife wants one for her kitchen! :)"
2,Good idea but...,"This looked like a product with a very good idea, but I have purchased 2 of them and both of them broke. The little fingers that give it it's ratcheting ability, in a matter of days, all broke off on both of them. When taking this thing apart I see that they are very fragile and seem prone to breaking. I did get both of them replaced by Amazon and will see if I just got 2 lemons. Otherwise a very solid product."
5,Attractive and Functional,"This truly is the best paper towel holder/dispenser I've ever used. For kitchen, bath, or workroom, the easy tear, one hand operation is extremely convenient. The description is dead on, it's very attractive and just as easy to install as any other. So, if you're looking for appearance and functionality, this is well worth the very reasonable price."
1,"Good design, awful manufacturing","I've gone through 2 of these: First one broke after about 8 months when the ratchet system failed. Its replacement only lasted about 6 weeks, when all the wires that make up the inner cage became disconnected from the base. I'm truly tempted to buy another, because the design is brilliant and it works so well when new. But the materials and manufacturing are garbage. Must. Not. Buy. Again."
1,broke some and then broke some more,"first the ratchet mechanism died after a few weeks. then the whole thing fell apart after a few months. it was pretty, but now it's in the trash can."
1,Ran out of ratchet,Bought this holder because of all the great reviews. Most likely people don't revise their reviews when something breaks. I bought this holder and it stopped working after 3 months. The ratchet gave out and now when you try to pull just one towel the whole roll unravels. Bummer.
5,This paper towel roll has been good to me for 7 years,"For seven years I never had to think twice about tearing off a paper towel - because it just did it perfectly, one handed, easy, looked good and was very convenient. We've even moved a couple of times and have taken this guy with us. Alas, the spindle finally broke, but I don't hold it against the product, it's been used and abused for so long. I immediately ordered another one."
4,"Works perfectly as described, slight clicking sound is annoying","Well made and works perfectly. Very easy to tear off one or two or exactly the amount of towels you need. The click-click sound is different from a standard towel holder, obviously, so you need to accept that trade-off, but I gave it 4 stars just because of that."
1,Doesn't last long...,"Updated Review: After a year, the towel holder's ratchet feature broke. I guess since it's cheap, I couldn't get too mad, but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. I reverted to the simple towel holder that will last and is a third of the price.Old Review: The ratchet mechanism really does allow you to pull off one paper towel at a time. It is sturdy, easy to refill, and mount. I have purchased several paper towel holders in the past, and this one is by far the best. It allows you to mount it horizontally or vertically. It comes with the proper screws and pieces for mounting. It's a shiny silver, so it should look perfect in anyone's kitchen!"
5,Someone finally built a better paper towel rack.,"This paper towel rack is simply the best one made. I only wish other manufacturers made such great, inexpensive products.1. It's well built (mostly metal parts). It has no flimsy ""ears"" to break.2. Change out rolls in a second by simply sliding roll over spring-tension spindle.3. Rolls are dispensed under slight ratchet tension (patented). ...no more wasted handfuls of towels."
4,Best towel holder I've ever purchased,"This towel holder gets points for sleekness/stylishness, ease of adding a new roll of paper (and of course removing a spent roll), and for the resistance it provides so that you don't pull too many towels out at once. That said, if your towels aren't tough enough, the resistance will keep your wet hands from pulling out a new towel and you'll be left with just the wet pieces you were able to tear away from a full sheet. Just keep that in mind when deciding what thickness towel to purchase and when figuring out how you grab the towel to minimize this problem. Given how annoying most towel holders are (clunky, ugly, space-takers, unwieldy roll replacement process), this is a minor gripe, and this inexpensive holder deserves your consideration."
5,Convenient and functional,"I love the stopping motion especially for the select-a-size papertowels. I also love the ease of the side mount for loading a new roll. No more papertowel roll flying off the end, this secures the roll and makes tear off a breeze."
4,My favorite so far,"Out of all of the holders I've owned...this is the best one so far. It's sturdy, high quality, and looks far better than the plastic ones. If you have a nice kichen and want to maintain the high quality feel to match your other appliances, I suggest purchasing this product."
2,Broken after two years...,"After two years of relatively mild use, the paper towel holder broke at the arm that holds the towels. We think there is two much stress placed in that area."
3,Noisy gadget,"Purchased this for our office restroom. I ordered it because the ratchet system seemed to control the amount of paper towels that would roll off. No doubt, the ratchet keeps the towels under control but the noise is awful. We can hear it from one office into another! Not so sure we'll keep this one for that reason. We have it mounted horizontally, saw another reviewer had the same noise complaint with theirs mounted vertically so doesn't appear that would make a difference."
5,Works like it should!,"I'll keep it short and sweet. It works like it should. It holds the paper towels securely, you can tear off a towel with one hand. It looks good, and for the price, it cannot be beat. If you're thinking about this item, just buy it, you'll be glad you did!"
4,"Great towel holder, but not perfect","Pros:1. Classy streamed look2. Works as advertisedCons:1. Loud clacking noise2. The wall mounting is level, but the part that sticks out to hold the paper towels sag to an uneven level when a new roll is mounted3. A large roll doesn't leave enough tension when pulling a sheet, so one handed operation isn't possibleDespite the cons, overall I am actually very pleased with the holder. It keeps the roll out of the way, easily accessible, and looks good. For the price, highly recommended."
3,Great Item - Wish It Worked Right!!!,"The first one I received the plastic ratchet and collar were broken. I tried to contact the company by email with no success and then contacted Amazon. They sent out another one right away. I have been using it for a month and have been real pleased until two days ago I notice that the plastic ratchet is not working like it did from the first. I am wondering if the blades are breaking like the original one I received. I will try to contact the company again and if no response I will contact Amazon. On the whole, the quality, apart from the plastic ratchet, is very nice. I rated it a 3 star due to the ratchet breaking and trouble with contacting customer service. A 5 star for Amazon. Lifetime Brands Corporate Headquarters, 1000 Stewart Avenue, Garden City, NY 11530 (516) 683-6000"
1,"good design, bad quality control","I'm very disappointed, after reading all the glowing reviews here. The ratchet mechanism failed in the first week. Now the roll spins without resistance (yet still makes the annoying ratcheting noise), meaning that I get a random number of towels dispensed depending on what angle I grab from and how hard I pull. This was a real waste of money. The only saving grace is: at least the new, larger rolls do not fall off this holder like the traditionally designed one it replaced."
1,Rachet resistance had very short lifespan,The rachet resistance was great for 6 weeks...now the towel holder is no better than any other ordinary one.
1,So LOUD!,"So, I bought this thinking that people complaining about the noise were exaggerating. They weren't! It's a pretty shiny chrome, but my goodness, it's LOUD! I couldn't stand the ratcheting noise, and I was able to pull multiple sheets off the roll at once. I gave it away because it wasn't worth it to pay return shipping."
1,Not So Perfect Tear,"The ratchet mechanism that is intended to make a perfect tear possible is apparently made from weak plastic; it broke after a few months of light use in our kitchen at home. No warranty or useful manufacturer contact information accompanied the towel holder. I have not been able to locate a customer service website for the US distributor, M. Kamenstein Corp. The Perfect Tear Towel Holder offers an attractive design, but, if you want a durable towel holder, I recommend that you buy something else."
2,Broke in 2 weeks,"Nice Style and more attractive than the plastic model I replaced, but the ratchet broke in less than 2 weeks and now it spins freely. The perfect tear aspect has been rendered useless."
2,Super sleek*****,"This towel holder was well worth waiting for. Could not find anything like it in my city, so glad I found this one. Similar ones in high scale kitchen shops are outragiously high and not as well made. When I saw this, I wanted to show it off, rather than try to hide it!That is the main point, sturdy and sleek all at the same time.Second, good feature, does not take up counter space! It looks so nice near my sink and keeps the paper towels neat and saves on wasted paper towels.Third point, price, price, price!"
2,loud and loose,"I mounted it under some cabinets over the sink. half the time I pull off a towel, the roll spools out 2-3 sheets, rather than letting me tear off one.also the ratchet mechanism is fairly loud.its screwed to the wall, and hold the paper towels off the counter so I'll keep it, but would not buy again (gimicky)"
4,Love it!,Makes getting paper towels a snap! I have it under my sink on the cabinet door for easy access - love it!
4,Paper Towel Holder,"My husband and I are pleased with the paper towel holder. We have had a succession of models, both on and off counter holders. We like this one. Also, we aren't bothered by the sound made when towels are dispensed."
4,Best Towel holder ever!,"Perfect Tear Chrome Paper Towel Holder, Horizontal Wall-MountedThis is the greatest towel holder ever invented. It's very easy to slip on a roll of paper towels, but one sheet or several sheets can be removed with one hand. It is also very attractive with a sleek chrome finish, and fits neatly under a kitchen cabinet. I highly recomend it."
3,Works Nice but Loud,The paper towel holder does it's job at limiting how many paper towels are pulled but the ratchet device is really loud in our office.
5,GREAT product---but SLOW shipping,"Ordered on September 6th and just received today (9/29/09).Looks nice, works great. Heavy duty chrome, not cheapo metal.Would recommend!"
4,Good for the money; ratchet brake is weak but does the job!,"Hard to get paper towel onto and off the center pole.Paper towel still keeps rolling when you tear (ratcheting mechanism isn't strong enough to stop the roll while you tear)BUT if it were, it would make it difficult to use. It's a balancing game, you need some resistance but you can't have too much. In this case, it's a tad too weak but who cares.Compared to diepsnsers without any ratcheting brake, this is pretty sweet.For the price, it's not too bad!"
4,Ratcheting holder,"Had this about a week now and it works great,fits snug under cabinet and looks good too.Hopefully the ratcheting part holds up for many years to come,have not owned long enough to give 5*"
5,Best Paper Towel Holder Ever!,"This towel holder is the best we have had. We have installed it on the end of our upper cabinet in the kitchen but vertically rather than horizontally. We have a small kitchen so we didn't want it sticking out in the aisle, so this worked best for us. My husband has always had problems with towel holders because he tends to grab the towel with one hand and start ripping, rather than use two hands and hold the thing still so half the roll comes off and he gets upset. With this one, there is a stopping mechanism to it so that you can pull just one towel at a time or a few. I am glad I finally found one HE can deal with!"
2,Broke after 3 weeks,This was great for 3 weeks. Then something broke and it lost its ability to keep the paper from rolling off the roll as quickly as possible.
2,"Looks good, mine was damaged","Buyers beware. This product looks very good but the one I ordered had apparently been sitting around the warehouse for a loooong time, it was badly rusted and I had to return it."
2,Looks okay .... sounds like a socket wrench.,Well it looks okay but once mounted to the bottom of a cabinet the ratchet (one sheet) noise is LOUD. The cabinet box amplifies an already ridiculously loud contraption....I'm going back to the basic kind and returning this thing-a-ma-jig.
2,I Got Almost 18 months Use Out Of It before the ratcheting system broke,"I waited before I posted a review to see how it would ""Hold up"" after reading the one star reviews it received.I bought it in February 2009 and I only use two rolls a month. The ratcheting system broke about 6 months ago, Soooo.....I got almost 18 months (88 cents a month) use out of it.I'm going to buy another one (cheep enough) to see if I have better luck.I wonder how many 4 & 5 star reviewers had troubles (Down the road) with it after maybe posting their review prematurely?"
3,Use Gently....,Bought this for my kitchen and it installed easily but the ratchet function works sometimes and sometimes it doesn't. You need a light pull to get the towel and it works great but pull too hard and you get a bunch. Have to adjust the ratchet function often. Looks great but works just so-so. Maybe I'm just too strong for it...hahahaha
2,ok...but LOUD,I bought this to replace a really old paper towel holder that was in my apartment and i love how this one looks but it is extremely loud when you pull on the paper towels to dispense them!I was shocked at how loud it is! I love it other than that downfall.
2,"A not very useful, sometimes annoying book","The organization of this book, listing topics from A to Z, is not natural or very useful. Other books tend to talk about, for example, attendents in one section. Due to the A to Z layout of this book, Best Man and Bridesmaids are side by side, and then you have to skip to other parts of the book to read about Maid of Honor or Groomsmen.By far the most annoying thing about this book is her constant attempts to sell you her other products. It seems like every couple of pages, she writes, ""For more information, get my video. . . "" and proceeds to hock another video on centerpieces or making your own chuppa."
4,Fantastic for everything BUT testing body fat percentage,"These scales are absolutely fantastic when it comes to monitoring your weight. You can set up to four profiles, enter your target weight and it will track your progress and show you from day to day how far up or down you are with regard to your goal. Unlike many other scales which give you a variance depending on where you stand, it doesn't matter where you stand on these scales, it will give you the exact same weight reading.The body fat testing is another thing. It is far from accurate. My body fat percentage is around 24%, give or take a percentage. But with these scales, one day it will show me to have a 35% body fat, another day 42% body fat - it's very far off.Having said the body fat inaccuracy, I highly recommend these scales for weight measurement."
2,Not enough ordering information!,"I purchased this for my father, and was disappointed to learn that he would not be able to use it since he has a pacemaker. This was not stated in the product information, so be aware of this when ordering!!"
4,Good product,"We are very happy with this scale. It works well for a family of four and has a very convenient guest setting as well. It seems very accurate and is pretty easy to use once you have set everything up. I like that it has an ""athlete"" setting for me and settings for the rest of the family for regular levels of activity. Body fat and hydration levels are less useful than I thought they might be when buying this product. In order for it to work well for the hydration and body fat readings, you need to measure yourself at the same time every day and you get good trending but you can't simply walk up to it at any time and get accurate and consistent readings on those items. Overall, it is great as a scale and to help you measure trends on body fat and hydration."
2,Not the Best for Runners,"I bought this watch primarily as a running timer. It is marginal for that use. First, the chronograph numerals are small and hard to see during the day and nearly impossible to see at night. Secondly, depending on the time, the watch hands may obstruct your view of the chronograph. So, if you're thinking of purchasing this watch for running, you might think twice."
2,2 egg cases-praying mantis,I will change the star rate if they hatch it has been almost 5 weeks and neither onehas hatched-
5,It took time but I have hundreds now,"I bought 4 cases, put them out and a month later did not have any Praying Mantises other than maybe 5. Ordered 4 more cases and waited. About a month later, I left for work in the morning with nothing happening in the aquarium I had set up for them. Came home at lunch and found hundreds in the aquarium. Came home that night, put most out in the garden and for weeks after this I kept having more hatching out of the cases. My neighbor told me that she is finding them in her yard as well and warned her visitors that they are not to harm my Praying Mantises. I find them on the house, in my garden, on trees and everywhere. They are growing and hopefully doing the job they were bought to do. Thank you."
2,Unhappy customer,"As of this date, 08/20/12, only 1 of the praying mantis eggs I purchased hatched. The first one hatched within 2 weeks of delivery. The second has not hatched. I will not buy this product again from this vendor. Very unhappy."
2,Egg cases only hatched three babies,"I followed the instructions that came with the egg cases perfectly. I even googled additional information to make sure I had everything just right. The mantids took much longer than average to hatch, and when they did, only three even hatched. Not all of them even survived. The egg cases were obviously defective and it's very unfortunate."
3,Still waiting,"I bought my babies about 4 weeks ago and still waiting for them to emerge. I've had the nests in the garden where it's been hot and wet, so, I dont know? It's not looking very promising."
2,Ripe Off Praying Mantis Case,Order 2 Praying Mantis Egg Cases; only 1 hatched; very dissappointing; only about 10 mantis in total. Might try again next year?
2,Disappointed,"Put theses eggs in an aquarium, and they never hatched. Both were dried out before they arrived. No return policy..."
2,praying mantis eggs,I bought these for my daughter's praying mantis kit and they arrived super fast. Its been almost 2 months now and they haven't hatched yet. I don't think it is going to happen. Sadness is upon me. A friend bought 10 egg cases from another place on amazon and their eggs came in mid-hatch....little baby praying mantis everywhere. Seems like a hit or miss item...good luck.
5,Mantis,Arrived in a timely manner. Hatched a plethora of Mantises in 4-5 weeks from both pods.Looking forward to seeing how they might populate my yard and garden.
2,No luck so far,"I've been following the instructions and so far no luck! I'm going to give it a few more weeks... after that if I have some babies I will up the star rating, it no babies I will change it to a one star."
2,Should've gone with locusts,"I had really hoped to release a plague of locusts on my neighborhood since I wasn't invited to the last block party. I figured it would be a proportionate response to being snubbed. The locust eggs were out of stock so I decided to go with praying mantis eggs since they come in packages of 400 eggs.I purchased 40 packages which should have given me a total of 16,000 bugs. Imagine my distress, though, when most of these didn't hatch. Of the ones that did, nearly all of them moved out of the neighborhood before reaching maturity.I was very disappointed in this product, though, admittedly, the entire blame cannot be laid at the feet of the vendor since herding bugs into a specific geographical location is something that the customer service representative emphasized that they could not guarantee."
1,babies were all handicaped!,"i got 2 egg sacs. i wanted to see them hatch so i kept each egg in its own clear, plastic cup. after about 3 weeks the first egg started hatching! i left the egg alone so they could hatch in peace. after i came back i noticed the babies had leg problems. almost none of the babies could stand up properly. ive raised mantids before so i know how they move and behave. most of the babies had a piece of the egg sac stuck on their legs in a way so they couldnt clean it off themselves. it left their 2 back legs tangled and they just couldnt stand up right...or even walk. out of all the babies i observed only 3 or 4 of them didnt have this problem and they were standing up right and ready to go. it was soo pathetic seeing them and felt sorry for the babies. i even tried leaving one in the cup so i could raise it by hand. it had the leg problem. it died after a day or so."
1,Ripoff!,"Given to a friend for a gift for his garden. He followed the instructions properly, and the eggs did not hatch at all. Don't waste your time with this seemingly ""novelty"" product."
2,Not worth the money,"I purchased these for my kids and for my garden. The first egg ""sack"" hatched after about 3 weeks. That was really cool and the kids were very excited. Sadly they wouldn't eat anything we put in with them and most died. We had the tiny flies and I bought special water packets for bugs. We released some of them and I hope they are still alive. I am still waiting for the second set to hatch. We have a mantis box in the window so it will get a lot of warmth.Follow up: the second sac of eggs never hatched. All of the mantis from the first set died. If you are going to hatch these, make sure you can get a supply of really small bugs first. I have been told that they will eat hamburger as well."
4,arrived in good condition,"These egg cases were a good size and arrived in good condition. Beyond that, who can tell with Mantids???I placed them in a protected place outside, near some roses covered with tasty aphids. Never saw a mantis, hoping for next year. I do think maybe I was late ordering them, maybe best to order these as soon as warm weather comes to give babies time to grow up before winter?this seller is so dependable, highly recommend this and will try again."
4,They hatched,"I bought two pods, placed them in brown paper lunch bags. They hatched about four weeks later. I then sprinkled then in the garden. I am not sure how many survived though, I should have set up a food system for them before letting them go. I plan on buying four pods this spring."
1,They didn't hatch!,The two Cases we bought never did hatch! We followed the guide they sent on where to put them. But nothing!
4,"The wait was worth it, I think...","Well, it took more than the couple of weeks the instructions said. However, once the egg sacs did hatch, the children had a ball watching the little mantids running all over the place. Since there are two sacs in an order, we placed one in a potted plant on the front porch, which we never saw hatch but there are signs that it did. The other, we placed in the frame of our chicken coop, out of the way of the chickens (promise!). The one by the coop we watched hatch, and I am waiting for the day our fly population is reduced. I haven't seen any since hatching, but our trees are eaten up with aphids, so I am assuming that's where they are (fat & happy.)"
1,Praying Mantis 2 Egg Cases,"I did get the two Egg cases and did what they instructed me to do. But as of yet over a month later still have not seen 1 praying mantis around either case.I live in South Florida so the weather is perfect but no Praying Mantis.It says two to three weeks before they start to come out of the cases but it has been about 4 weeks and nothing, so Not so Happy with this deal.Robert in Florida"
1,a disappointment,"As an organic gardener I really wanted these mantis eggs (as well as the lady bugs I bought from this same supplier) to work. It's now been over a month since I followed the package directions and I still don't have any activity. There appears to be no change with the egg sacks at all. There is no return on this product, so I definitely feel like I wasted my money. I hate to give a one-star rating, but I feel like at least one of the egg sacks should have yielded some mantises."
4,Praying Mantis,Got quite a few praying mantis with this product. They certainly do their job in the garden! Thanks.
3,praying mantis egg cases,The egg cases came very quickly and in perfect shape. The only problem is that nothing has hatched yet in either egg case and it's been over 21 days.
5,be patient,It takes a while. The weather has to be right but the eggs finally hatched. This was a lot of fun for my 11 year old son.
1,WHO is the scoundrel here?,"Intellectual children, still fresh from their nurseries,sip this revolting woman's non-stop deceit. Her uttersilence about her lover Otto Katz's torture and execution backin communist Czechoslovakia, and her totally bogus JULIA sayit all. When she was not suing someone, she was confabulatingher own autobiography along the way. Funny, her career beginsas Hammett's fades. A HUAC plot, no doubt."
3,"Imperative for Lutyens Fans, but...","A must have for Lutyemns fans, but not the meaty treatist we have been waiting for. I expect MORE from Margaret Richardson!"
1,I disliked this book so much I returned it!,"As a lover and avid collector of books, I had high hopes for this book -- at first glance it seemed entrancing, especially the topic. Unfortunately, once I started reading it more carefully, my spirits sank. Some of the pictures are visually interesting, but most are not. Even more disappointing, there is not much substantive information either. If you like the idea of this book and are looking for a more satisfying read, check out At Home With Books : How Booklovers Live With and Care for Their Libraries by Estelle Ellis(Editor), et al. That book is worth every penny, and you'll enjoy it."
2,A couple of good photos,"If you want to see suggestions for how to live with large quantities of books, buy ""At Home With Books"". If you have some money left over after that, buy this book. There are lots of pictures, mostly not very inspiring, or very useful to a person who owns a lot of books. On the other hand, three or four of the photos were very inspiring.Still, ""At Home With Books"" had a lot more to offer in the way of inspiration and ideas. I'm not sorry I bought this book, but I would be if my book-buying budget were even slightly more restricted than it is."
2,good but not very good,some interesting library and book shelf layouts but i feel the author didn't go as far as could and should have. i subscribe to many home periodicals and have seen so much more in those than with this one book devoted entirely to physical book display. good book but at price definately top retail.
3,y waste ya money,great songs but of u a tru bad boy fan u got em all anyways. i suggest you just listen to ready to die over and over again and dont pay attention to any new cds that come out from puffy or any other of these wack artists comin out like chingy
2,10th yr. Anniversary vs Greatest Hits. There's a difference!,"If you have love for Hip Hop, chances are you already have these songs.A 10th anniversary for a record label such as Bad Boy should've been, at the very least a double cd but really a box set. Someone should have told Puff that this is not a typical ""Greatest Hits"" album, this is a 10th Anniversary album, which is supposed to reflect 10 years of hits that Bad Boy has created for Hip Hop, not a compilation of songs that any cd changer can mimic. Words of wisdom Puff, take a look at Def Jam's 10th anniversary BOX SET with their list of 60 tracks and then take a look at your 15 track 10th anniversary Cd. See why we are so dissapointed. Maybe you'll get it right with the 15th or 20th yr anniversary.Don't get it twisted, Bad Boy will still be here and they will still be pumping out hits that will make you fall in love with Hip Hop all over again.-M."
2,Makes No Sense...,"These are NOT bad Boy's hits! First off, WHERE is Faith Evans!?!? She's on the cover, but none of her singles (Love like This, All Night Long, I Love You.. all of which were Top-15 mainstream cuts) are on this album. Also, 112's biggest hits were ""Peaches and Cream"" and ""Anywhere."" It seems like more of a promotion of Bad Boy's 1997 heyday than anything rooted in genuine substance. This album is whack!"
1,bad boy is hurting,"Puffy hasn't had an artist since Lil' Kim left. He can't put out a platium hit so reshuffles his past success. Half of this album was on his greastest hits, released a couple of years ago. Puffy...your losing it."
1,trick no treat,"Just got this . And I was happy but when I open up my sealed package .there was only a egress not a cd ,which is wat I wanted the most . So I feel like a trick was play . With no treat"
1,~this whole album sucks! n i only like da 1'st track on it!~,"diddy's jus tryna make money or show off his wack a$$ ""Da Band""!GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,I could burn a CD and make a better Bad Boy Compilation.,"Although it is acknowledged that the hits are there, many individual's favorite cuts are not. I for one bought this CD because I wanted to relive memories of hearing Ma$e's tracks, or hearing Biggie's melodious voice, but when I popped it in and kept hearing Puffy's ""yeah!"", ""c'mon"", ""whut?"", ""unh-unh"", and his ""and it wont stop"" talking all over the songs...I was reminded how much his voice angered me. Another thing that really ticked me off was the remix to ""Only You"" the track here didn't have the Ma$e verse, it was a bootleg version on an official CD. Overall I was really dissapointed with this CD."
2,Puffy Bites Again,"Bad Boy already had a greatest hits collectin in '98, and FIVE of these songs were on it. On top of that, where are cuts from Faith Evans, the Lox, G-Dep or Shyne? This album is pretty much to get interest going in another posthumous BIG album, even though the last one already was all duets. This album is weak, but it might've worked better as a double CD, one side the radio hits like Mo Money, Love Like This, DIDDY, No One Else, etc. and the other side more hardcore like Warning, 24 Hours To Live, Special Delivery, Life Story, Ten Crack Commandments, etc. Come to think of it let me just go make my own compilation...."
4,distilling,easy quotes and selected aphorisms from an author whose spiritual life was transformed by the simple messages about managing our brains
3,Intriguing theories,"My brother-in-law was very interested in this book. It takes some very interesting ideas about the series. Though I myself am not a Trekker, I love theories like these."
2,"sorry, but television ain't literature","This book attempts to look at Star Trek as if it was literary art as generated by a solitary genius. I mean, come on! As good as TV gets, it will never compare to Tolstoy or Nabokov. Yet Richards strains to analyse the stories for a depth that may or may not be there.WHile as a Star Trek fan I did enjoy the descriptions and criticism in this book - you do see it in a different light - it adds up to too much about a disposable medium. Characters can't evolve much in TV, great themes cannot be explored except as formulae."
4,Great practical value,"Books helps to create meaningful write ups of issues that are sometimes hard to properly deal with, very practical examples and explanations."
2,from 1998- almost a decade old,"This book was published in 1998 and you can tell. While there are a few good examples and verbiage that can be used again, it is ultimately outdated. Take it from a practicing HR professional; you cannot use the majority of these in your workplace. You may be able to use the ideas and reasoning behind the documents, but the verbiage will need updated."
5,Great for supervisors who want excellent documentation,"This book is a lifesaver, especially since all the write ups are on diskette. It really gives a detailed outline of how someone is to be disciplined. From the outlines in the book it gives detailed step by step instructions on how to document employee performance issues. I'm glad I bought the book."
4,Books in Spanish,I bought this for a Latin friend of mine for his birthday. I really like that you have lots of good novels translated into Spanish.
4,written from the perspective of an adolescent,"I picked this book up thinking it was about something else. As much as I didn't like where the character was going (very realistic) I couldn't put it down. It is well written from the perspective of an adolescent, but gave me the chills that some children take this road or one like it. I, too, was reminded of my own desire for independence at that age, and the willingness to go to whatever means to achieve it."
3,works well,"This is an great product, compact and powerful .. only setback is that you have to be very close to attacker to use it but i think it is worth every dollar for it's effectiveness when you do get it off.I also hav a very small one million volts small fry .. just to hear the voltage rattle across the top is enough justice for buying it."
2,Yuk,"You get what you pay for. On the plus side, this monitor has lots of controls, and they're easy to use. Also, the monitor comes with excellent docs and software for Wintel machines (I'm using a Mac). On the minus side, despite adjusting all of the controls, the monitor just doesn't seem very sharp. Most of the text, particularly in the corners, seems rather fuzzy. I suppose you shouldn't expect too much for the price. If you're looking for a large monitor to play games on though, this might be suit you."
4,Blah blah blah,"I've had the monitor for awhile. It's a refurb from Samsung. Very, very sharp text and icons on Windows. Corners sharp too, color good. However, after about 6 mos. or so, the monitor started doing this gamma fade/out of focus thing every once in a while. Now this could be because it's a refurb unit. In any case, I'm so impressed with the sharpness and low price, I would buy two of these before I bought one of the Sony's, which look washed out and ill-defined to me.Beware the 955DF (flat screen) it is not as sharp and harder to adjust then the 950P, I bought both and returned the flat 955DF. I also like the 950P because it has BNC and regular video connectors on the back. So I can hook up two computers at once (after buying the BNC vid cable cheap from pccables.com). The pictures is sharper and colors richer with the BNC cable on the 950P."
1,Golf Ball Marker,This is a waste of money. Go Buy a permanent magic marker. It's much cheaper. The little plastic ring is overrated in that you can make your own and have it work as well if not better.
5,"Fantastic Watch, don't pay $750 though!","This is an awesome watch, never loses time, completely indestructible. It shows wear a little too easily, but other than that I have no complaints. One warning: Do not pay $750 (list price) for this watch. It can be found for much less, usually around $400."
4,the sharp edge of social dogma,The first three tracks are excellent and inspire compassion. Listen to the rest before you go into the danger zone. They are sure to remind you of the racial divide and the anger that flows within the concrete jungle.
4,Good Read,Piers Anthony has a great imagination. His books seem to be written for a younger crowd but I still enjoy his work at 27. Read the series it is worth while.
2,OK but for one issue,"Neat idea; I plan to use it for a science class. The only problem is, the two I received have air bubbles inside and they prevent the 'sand' from dropping as it should. You have to shake it up and tilt it around just right to get the air bubbles to rise before it will work properly. Otherwise, the design is sleek and interesting and it seems durable."
4,"Classy, but a little too serious","I bought this timer because I thought it looked nice and indeed, it does in real life. However, as a desk toy, it's not that fun, since it takes a long time for the timer to run its course! About 12 minutes or so. I doubt anyone would look at it for 12 minutes straight. Also, the black sans and orange sand don't finish at the same time. Most of the time, the orange sand ends before the black sand (usually by a few minutes). At first, I thought that this difference in time between the two colors was a letdown, but now that I think of it, it might be a good thing, since you can use it to time 2 different things! Still, it looks nice on a desk. Like most other have said, there are air bubbles that can sometimes block the sand. I simply shake my timer a little bit to clear the bubbles. After that, it works fine."
2,Great Idea -- poor execution,"I had another like this but which was engineered better. For whatever reason, the black side seems to get stuck in the narrows and ruins the entire effect. Am trying to see if there is a way to maneuver it to avoid this pitfall but so far no joy"
2,"Fun, but...","This was a fun toy to play with, but it clogs up and the colors don't flow on one side. The other side works great though."
2,Would be nice without the air bubbles.,"This is the second one of these I've bought the other from a different company, after having the first one for months and finally getting fed up with the amount of fiddling around with it that was required to get the air bubbles to allow the sand to move through to the other section of the hourglass I had enough and purchased this one.And let me tell you this one has been a great improvement over the one I already owned. The one I already had, had considerable amounts of air in both sides which was a big nuisance. But this one... well.. one whole side of this one has absolutely zero air in it and works perfectly, the other side has so much air in it that when you turn it upside down the black sand can't get into the lower half at all.I gave the product two stars, I would have given it two and a half since only half of it worked as advertised but Amazon doesn't allow for such.Whatever happened to quality control?"
3,Not too shabby,"As with everything, The picture always makes the item look bigger than it actual is. No bigger than the size of my hand. Not too fond of the fact that there are some pretty sizable air bubbles in there but thats okay I guess. Its still pretty cool though to watch it. Its kind of like watching a valcano erupt on a smaller scale in super slow motion. All in all I'd say its purchase worth getting for something like your desk at the office."
2,Not fully pleased,"The bag tells you to wash before use and so does the tag on the comforter. We just bought this a few days ago and I washed it according to directions, and now the colors are not near as vibrant. I was much more pleased with it before washing. Why does it tell you to wash before use? Is it a chemical in the fabric? I wished I would have left it looking like new until there was a need to wash it."
2,Inferior,"This system was purchased brand new and lasted us less than 2 years. Sorry, but when I purchase a home theater system, 2 years is not nearly long enough to justify the price."
5,Cheaper than a rack full of dumbbells,"Quality handles! I have the Bowflex dumbbells with the dials, but they only go up to 52.5 lbs. I require a heavier weight for Presses, Rows and such. Thus I keep 60 loaded on these bad boys at a minimum and then add from that. It's worked out great and if you already have Olympic plates for your barbell it's a no-brainer. Plus I love having two sets of dumbbells instead of an entire rack full of them, more space for other things."
1,Chinese Made Garbage,"Not going with the flow here. Clearly I feel these are garbage. First off, these are made in China. That little ""USA"" image you see along side of the image of the handles might be construed as a bit misleading. One bar was okay, but the other was covered in manufacturing nicks, and doinks. These bars were chromed after all the nicks, etc, evidencing this was a manufacturing flaw. Knurling on that same bar was boogered up as well and chromed-over, again showing it was a defect from the get-go. Trying to get a RMA number out of Bayou and Troy Barbell is like pulling teeth, but at least with pulling teeth, it gets done. No RMA seems to be forthcoming from these clowns. I drop a lot on equipment (too much), but I can guarantee I won't waste another nickle on anything from Troy Barbell."
2,Not One of Cameron Judd's Best Endeavors,"Fans of Cameron Judd will be somewhat dismayed by the gore contained in this work. While still very tame compared to many books, much of the violence found here is far more graphic than other Judd efforts such as Bad Night at Dry Creek, Corrigan, and Mr. Littlejohn..The story line is as engrossing as usual, and the charcters typically come to vivid life. However, a disturbingly high number of likable folks meet tragic endings-another disappointment to this story.From an unfamiliar author, I might have given this book higher praise, but from Cameron Judd I have come to expect a more enjoyable read, which he has always delivered in the past."
1,Do not buy this if you don't have a satellite radio installed,This product only works if you have a satellite radio.it will not work with out it.I bought this for my 2005 Nissan pathfinder.I called tech support for help and they have told me it will not work without satellite radio.
5,2004 Nissan Murano audio for iphone connection,"I used this to connect my IPhone to my 2004 Nissan Murano. Easy to connect and worked just like it's supposed to work. Be careful when taking apart your console and get internet directions for taking it apart correctly or you might break soemthing. I forgot to place a towel on my console to put between the radio that came out of the dash and the console and, sure enough, got the console plastic all scratched up from doing this. Also, use an electric line filter to clear up static from the engine to the 12-volt connection. I didn't and now have a slight whine at high volume. You still need an RCA to IPnone adapter to connect the IPhone to this unit as it just has RCA out jacks."
4,Super Swimmer,"This is a great product if your child is learning to swim, older children 5-7 age.Where the parents are still watching them ,but it gives them alittle more freedom to learn the strokes,needed for swimming lessons.It also can grow with your child as they learn to swim, the pads come off as needed.I have seen these also used in the swim classes, that use them. Its a confidence bilder for the child."
4,Not bad!,"This movie isn't bad. It's much better than an average 3 star rating but not a 5 star work of perfection either. Some things were a bit annoying to me. For example, I don't know why we had to switch from Spanish, to French to English and back again. It should have been completely in Spanish. So far I can't see the value of using three different languages, it's just an unnecessary complication.I eventually understood that Heaven was a place for black and white 40's/50's glamor. However, for a moment I was a bit confused in the beginning. Things unfold as the movie carries along so if you're confused just stick with it and it starts to unfold and you'll understand as you go along."
3,Not Gael's best work,"The plot was good. The acting was not. Difficult to get through, took me three tries."
3,The history and development of community psychiatry in U.K.,"The closure of mental hospital written by prof. Peter Hall was an excellent reference book to describe the background, history and development of community psychiatry in England."
4,"""Gloom, despair & agony on me...""","""...Deep, dark depression, excessive misery...""Rex Hobart doesn't cover that old ""Hee-Haw"" tune on this album ('cause then he'd have to crack a smile...) but the message is pretty much the same. This record, a concept album if I'm not mistaken, kicks off with four mercilessly dark songs that chart the utter destruction of a love affair, and after our hero moves out and starts hittin' the bars, things really start to get bad. There are the late night phone calls, the suggestion of make-up and/or sympathy sex, and the long hours spent staring in the mirror, not liking what you see. Yeah, Hobart lays it on pretty thick, but this is hick music that's still got some bite. I'll take this over anything Kenny Chesney has to offer, any day."
1,a truly terrible product,I purchased a box of these products a year ago and literally within hours they began to fail. Within a month half of the bulbs I'd install had failed. A year later only 15 to 20% remain working. I'm always replacing bulbs. Other compact fluorescent bulbs I've had and the incandescent bulbs I've had do not have not caused any problems. The manufacturers warranty is worthless and they did not respond to my request for information regarding the high failure rate. This is a worthless product bad for the environment and bad for your financial well-being. If they gave these bulbs away it would not be worth paying shipping to receive.
5,AWESOME!,"I ordered 3 of these barstools to go in my new house. I was a little scared because I was not able to see them in a store first but it was a pleasant surprise. I love them! There was no assembly required so that made my husband very happy also. They look beautiful and are very high quality. The only down side is I had to pay for shipping. Other than that, I had an excellent experience. I highly recommend these barstools."
4,"Great stands - TWO stands per order, not one!!","These stands are elegant and functional and very well-designed. Those who are obsessive about hiding wires (like me) will appreciate the back panel covers and hollow stands.NOTE THAT THE PRODUCT IS MISLABELED ABOVE! Each unit shipped contains TWO stands, not one as indicated. If you're only using the stands for your front speakers, order a quantity of one. If you're using them for front and rear speakers, you'll need two pairs."
1,Terrible,I agree with everyone who has written a review. I have tried really hard to install this mirror but just cant seem to get it right. I would not recommend this to anyone.
2,Child - front facing child mirror,Mirror was a little tricky to work with to mount. Disappointed that mirror is tinted and so view of child is not as clear. Better than not having a mirror at all.
1,It stinks!,I agree with Becky. After breaking my The First Years mirror that clipped on my rearview I went looking for a new one and this flip down mirror was the closest thing I could find. It stinks! It's nearly impossible to install and blocks too much of my view while driving. I'm returning it. Hey Becky I found a replacment First Years mirror on ebay! I know that one is well worth the price.
1,Just horrible,This actually poses a great danger to your child's health. As you try to install it you will ultimately become so frustrated that you will hurl the mirror across the interior of the vehicle and it may ricochet off the dash and bonk your unsuspecting child. If you happen to be one of the five people that can magically attach the crummy strap you can rest assured that it will spring off as soon as you hit your first pothole.Whoever invented this disaster needs to be put in a timeout.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,"I bought two of these mirrors to replace the suction cup safety 1st mirrors that I had (which are also a waste of money, if you're wondering). The installation is crazy; it's basically a sticker with velcro. It DOES NOT fold up behind the rear view mirror!!! Also, the so-called ""mirror"" is not even a mirror; it's a sticker or piece of plastic or something. You get an extremely distorted view; nothing like the little picture on the package. I don't know who they are trying to fool with this bad design, but I am returning this purchase and would not recommend it to anyone."
1,Terrible distortion,Glad I didn't even bother trying to install this after reading the reviews. I just opened the package and saw how horrible the mirror quality actually was and decided it is a terrible product. Wish I would have seen the reviews before I purchased these for my and my husband's car at Babies R Us. It should tell you something when the mirror is completed blocked by a piece of paper on why you should not buy.
2,Probably the best examination of the Watts uprising,"Written with biting irony, Horne has produced the most comprehensive analysis of the Watts uprising to date. He examines that rebellion from a variety of angles, and gives the casualties of the repression a human face. This book will become required reading for any public policy course that deals with the urban unrest of the 1960s."
2,angry and deeply unintelligent,"Poor Gerald Horne does his best to write a history of the Watts ""Uprising"" -- one of the few such ""revolts"" that targeted liquor stores as prime military targets. But his thinking is scattershot and he does not use the English language well. Still, some will be satisfied with the facts he has marshalled."
1,Heavily biased and author is suspect,"I'm reading a preview of this book on Google Books; it's rife with rumor, hearsay, fanciful conjecture, and an extremely biased point of view. It's also not very well written. After noticing that the author Gerald Horne kept making remarks about ""class consciousness"", ""the working class"" and using the word ""lumpen"" several times, I began to grow suspicious. Well, it turns out that Horne is a member of the editorial board of the Communist Party USA's journal. I'm not going to bother giving an actual review; the guy's obviously putting out propaganda.Horne reports the details of autopsies conducted on each and every person killed by the police and National Guard, and I noticed that a lot of them showed ""acute ethanol intoxication"". He curiously never explains what this is (as he should) but it's medical-speak for ""drunk"". LOL!I'm reading the preview only for some of the first-hand accounts therein."
3,Informative,Informative but not quite what I was looking for. I have an Oster Counter Top Convection/Toaster Oven.Still looking for a better recipe/information book.
2,"Just fine, but could find cheaper","I think the product could have been slightly bigger at the head, but otherwise, they're your run of the mill utensil set. I do like the small spoonish aspect of the utensils but I think you can find them for cheaper elsewhere."
2,A big disappointment compared to McCloud's other books,"Having purchased two of McClouds previous books, ""Lighting Style"" and ""Complete Book of Paint and Decorative Techniques"", I thought the man could do no wrong. They were excellent choices. In this book, however, McCloud departs from his complex, professional approach, and provides ""vignettes"" that read like ""Grrr-animals"" theme rooms. From a ""Carribbean Kitchen"" to a ""Biedermeier Bathroom"", the rooms end up looking like movie sets for a college theater production. Pasting xeroxed corinthian columns on a wall does not a Greek Revival villa make. If you have no imagination and are not able to put ideas together yourself, buy this book. If you want something more substantial, buy the other two books I mentioned. Mr. McCloud is truly a talented man. I personally feel that his other books are better showcases for his talent."
3,Not Useful - Too Theme-y,"This was a beautifully photographed book. I'm just not sure why I didn't like it very well. Maybe it was because I did not find much that was useful in a room that I decorate in my home.The book was somewhat helpful in demonstrating some of the techniques used to get the wall treatment, but maybe I am a simpleton and needed more steps. The rooms also did not have a very realistic look. I did like the wall treatment in the tuscany style room but really didn't like the room. The Greek room was also kind of strange looking to me, maybe because the decor was so ""fake"" looking.I was just thankful I checked it out of the library first before spending my hard-earned money. ""-)If you like a VERY themed room, you might like this book, but I think I prefer something a little more subtle and classy that does not SCREAM the theme."
3,"A Beautiful Book, but not enough detail regarding techniques","This is an absolutely BEAUTIFUL book. Many styles are explored and techniques discussed, however, there is not enough detail regarding completing the techniques. I had high hopes when I purchased this book, but I think that if I try doing any of these techniques, I'll have to make it up as I go along."
5,amazing condition and timely arrival,"It's really amazing when your expectations are so far from reality...Having little experience with ""things internet"" I expected this book to be just ok and that it would probably take a month or so to get it...Wow, was I wrong! I got the book in a matter of DAYS and the condition was AMAZING! Hah! I feel like I got away with something...like they made a mistake and sent a master copy to some big movie star!"
3,Fast Fun Read,"Dale Aycock, a California writer, had this book published by the now defunct publisher Leisure Books. She wrote a couple of other novels and all of them contain fast moving, fun plots. If you see it at a used book store, it's worth a look."
1,Pulp sci-fi 80's style.,Starspinner and it's sister book Star Drifter were both written and funded by Dale Aycock. They were published at his expense by Leisure publishers
4,very good,"DEFENDERS has a vibrant way to introducethe natural camoflauge of animals. Each page has a veryinteresting discription coupled with a large, beautifulillustration. Great for a class to enjoy."
1,Couldn't find a size that fit,I ordered my regular size - it was shipped and was too big (length). Then I exchanged for the next 1/2 size down - it was shipped and was too small (length).
4,Great Reference Book,"It seems O'Reilly Publishing has developed a niche for providing no-nonsense books for the intermediate to advanced user, this book is no exception.If you are looking for your next book in ASP, to take you to the next level, this is your book. If you don't know anything about ASP, buy this book to read after you have read an introductory book."
2,Designing Active Server Pages,"This book is certainly not for someone just beginning to learn how to design ASP for the web. It may be more useful as a reference, but even then I somewhat question it. Usually the O'Reilly books are quite good but this seems to be the exception to the rule.When a book about ASP design starts off on page 3 with a section entitled ""What's Wrong with ASP Design?"" you know you are in trouble! The next 2 sections titled ""Why Hasn't ASP Design Advanced?"" and ""What Can Be Done to Improve ASP Design?"" (which is 12 pages in length!!) don't give you that warm, fuzzy feeling either! If the book is designed to scare you off of ASP design it may succeed!It seems to skip the basics and dives right into many somewhat obscure things. Altogether, this is most definitely NOT a book for someone starting out in ASP!"
1,Disappointing,"I am sorry. In my opinion this book is a waste of paper. I havetried to find some answers to simple questionsabout ASP in this book. Things concerning littlethings one might forget and you want to look up.After a few times using the book in this way it's clear this book tells us little useful things. Even free (digital/psd) manuals on ASP are a lot more useful. Afterbuying this book from amazon it went quite quickly to a dump shop, sorry..."
1,Not good,"I bought this book as an introduction to ASP.I did not expect much, but I got even less than that -- some 330+ pages of light prose, little specific information about the platform, trivial code examples and some obviously borrowed answers to the ""what is good software design"" question.Real disappointment, moreover so since it is coming from ORA.Looking for a general reading on software design? Design Patterns would be a much better choice. General book on ASP? I don't know the market well, but avoid this one."
2,Not useful / applicable,"The problem: the meat of the book is used describing two ""reuse"" apps; 1 for forms and 1 for DB admin. The problem is that these really aren't very good ways of doign either. In fact it's not really a good design to try and ""objectify"" either of these two concepts. And the thing is at the end of each chapter the author even says so.Spend your money elsewhere, buy a subscription to Wrox's ASPToday site. It is awesome."
2,Waste of Time and Money,"I do not find fault in the purpose behind this book. Code reuse is of extreme importance in coding stable, scalable, and bug-free applications. This book however does not address anything that has not already been discussed in much greater detail by authors with more experience. This is only an application of that code reuse. The problem is, if you are creating any application that must meet certain security standards and or must be very scalable, the solutions offered in this book are of little or no use.I recommend purchasing ""Code Complete"" by Steve McConnell. This book will show you how to be a better programmer. ""How to Solve It"" by Polya, will help you to think so you can come up with better solutions than ""Designing Active Server Pages"".Do not get me wrong, the book is not terrible, rather it is useless."
3,"Good Overivew - A Little ""Lite"" on Content","Scott Mitchell does a good job of articulating the theory and benefits of designing effective, reusable ASP code. Unfortunately, in the end the book lacks sufficient breadth and depth in many topic areas.Upon purchasing this book my expectations were somewhat low (how much information can you pack in a 300 page book?) considering the extensive topic. Although the book is a good overview, I suspect most developers would rather spent their time actually designing reusable components rather than reading about why they should design reuseable components.In the end, I would say the book is worth the read but level your exepctations."
5,Useful book,"I run two commercial websites using asp. I have found this book to be clearly written and well layed out. Asp is definately the way to go if you want to save time, and write as few pages as possible. I recommend this book as it is well written and seems to cut to the chase, and gets down to the information that you need."
5,Asp Class very clear,I have read lot of book about ASP this book is the best book for argoment about Class.
1,Wouldn't it be nice...,"Upon getting an ASP project dropped in my lap I quickly discovered the horrible practices that ASP encourages. This book seemed like a godsend through the first chapter. Mr. Mitchell identified a problem... It just seems as if he should have quit writing the book upon discovering that it's mission is just impossible. Getting code reuse out of a technology who answers reuse with SSI's and COM just doesn't work. It seems like the chapters on reusing form validation were WAY too long.. Does anyone even really need that stuff ? Maybe it's just me. At any rate, I'd suggest going to the bookstore and reading the first couple chapters there. Past that, you'll be dissapointed.. (with ASP and the book.)"
2,DIGITAL DISPLAY HARD TO READ,"I have owned this watch for about 6 months. I like having both analog and digital displays, but when the minute hand is between 4 and 8, it covers up the digital display and makes it nearly impossible to decipher. It's especially hard while running (and downright dangerous while biking!) to read the digital display at a glance - even if it's not covered by the minute hand, because it's so small. The Indiglo is nice and bright, and the analog dial is easy to read, but I'm rather surprised that Timex even put this watch on the market. (NOTE: the analog and digital displays do not synchronize -- you have to set them seperately.)"
3,Poorly edited.,"I had been searching for this book for a long time and I was thrilled when I saw that it had been reprinted. After reading it, I realized that I hadn't really missed much. The main story in the book, the Thorn Boy, is a decent story. The other short stories in this collection read like mediocre fanfiction. If you are expecting work on the level of Wreathu or any of SC's more recent work and are at all a discriminating reader, you wiil be dissappointed. The worst thing about this collection is that editing is almost non -existant. I ran across so many typos and mispellings that I could not believe this was a professionally published book.This is definately a work to borrow from a friend or find in a library or used bookstore. At least it shows how much SC has grown as writer."
3,"Gorgeous, but not practical.","This colander is beautiful. If you're looking for a colander that's purely decorative, I highly recommend this one. Also, the company that produces this colander offers a line of other kitchen items with the same tea rose pattern.We had this gorgeous colander hanging from a hook in our kitchen. The hook fell out and the colander dropped onto our kitchen counter. A gigantic piece of paint chipped on the outside of the colander exposing a black patch underneath. I blame myself for my shoddy carpentry skills, but be warned that if you plan to use this painted colander like a brass or stainless steel colander, then it probably won't last."
3,Euro Pro Review,"I purchased this serger and found it constantly broke needles and they are very difficult to replace. Even though the item was color coded to thread, it was still somewhat confusing. The bulb burned out only after a week, then the needle broke and I was in big trouble. I had to buy a bulb that did not fit too well to see how to replace the needle & then re-thread. I was not as pleased as I thought I would be and have not used in nearly a year and will be glad to sell. The lady on HSN ""made"" it look so simple!"
3,Not really good.,"For my child's 6th birthday she asked for this product. So I got it for her and I am very disapointed. After just 5 min. she got bored and went off with her friends. Luckily my sister (her aunt) got the bratz styling head for her. She loved it. So for my conclution, If I would choose between the barbie head and the bratz head, the Barbie styling head would loose!"
3,Quick delivery good pocket reference,I am a So Cal dive pro and use these reference materials for my students. This is a good resource. The small size is handy. The reference material is good and the illustrations are good but lack the same value as photographs.
5,Be a hula girl,"I am originally born and raised in Maui, and now I am married with children, raising them in California. I recently went back to Maui to visit my family, and bought my six year old daughter a hula outfit just like the ones worn in this video. When I got home, my daughter was wanting to learn to do the hula, so this DVD came to mind. It shows you step by step how to do simple hula dances just for children around her age group. She loves this DVD, and watched it twice in a row! She got quite good just watching it two times. While living in Maui, just about every little girl wants to be a hula girl, and I wanted my daughter to experience what I did when I was her age. This was a good way to let her learn a few sentences in Hawaiian also, and she loves to watch the children on the stage, and danced along with them once she learned these basic steps to hula dancing. Thanks for making such a sweet DVD for little girls. It's a small price to pay for hours of wholesome fun."
2,it's ok,"it wasted time by showing the little girls on the video getting made-up for the dance. the girls i was showing it to lost interest, and didn't want to watch anymore. afterward, it was very hard to get them interested in hula, and watching another video. i would only recomend this if you are watching with 3 and maybe 4 year olds, but even they might lose interest. on a good note, the way she talks to the audience is nice and sweet, and the children seem to like her."
2,Not what I expected,"This video what not at all what I expected. All of the write-ups for the product state that there are four hula songs on the DVD. There are four hula songs, but only two songs are taught - neither of which are any of the four that are listed in the description. The two songs taught are Pearly Shells and Hukilau. Try finding that in any description. I really thought the DVD would have more substance to it. I bought it for my five-year-old niece and am a little embarrassed to give it to her. The instructor is okay, but if you know the difference between good hula and mediocre hula, this is not the DVD for you. (If you don't know the difference, you will probably love it.)"
4,Cute,"Cute video. I bought it for my daughter's 6-year ""hawaiian"" themed birthday party. The girls really got into watching and learning all 3 dances."
4,Great dvd for learning hula,Great DVD for learning how to hula. My wife wanted to learn she has learned now and can do these steps. My daughter is into hula and now my wife can enjoy hula with her.
1,YUCK! Don't do it,"This was, without a doubt, the WORST pecan pie I have ever eaten. It contained way too much egg and not sweet enough, nor enough pecans. I ended up getting rid of it by taking it to a potluck...and I love pecan pie! What's up with that?"
5,Incredible Experience,"If you are a tennis lover you have to see this video. You can't find a perfect volley lesson video anywhere. But Rafter is a volley master in this video.Wathch him, learn that... I dont need to talk abaut Sampras who is a Trademark."
5,Very enjoyable,"I like how he experiments with his vocal chords. Innovative, with a lot of texture and many layers."
3,"Lots of nice songs, but I want more uptempo songs.","I thought the New Radicals album was great for a few songs. I loved ""You get what you Give"" and ""Mother we just can't get enough"", but I would have liked to see more uptempo songs like ""You get what you Give"". It was well worth the money, but there needs to be a more spread variety."
5,The cd has a very new and very good sound and is a good buy,"The first time that I listened to this cd I found it quite strange, but after hearing a few times I couldn't get the songs out of my head. This CD is well worth buying."
2,Manic display of music,"The first single is 1999 anthem tune, but the rest of the cd is mixed messages of love drugs and god. With the New Radicals, the Gregg Alexander seems to try to be a new avante garde artist who really is the same as anyone else. It's okay, I'd rather have just listened to the radio."
4,Mature pop with bizarre quirks...,"This is not gonna be one of those ""I love deez guys!"" gooey teenybopper reviews, this is a review from a serious musician. When I first heard ""You Get What You Give"" on the radio, thoughts of Bono came to mind, as that song had a certain U2-esque sound to it, to me. After buying the album, I realize there are some catchy tunes here. ""I Don't Wanna Die Anymore"" is a optimistic sounding song, while ""I Hope I Didn't Just Give Away the Ending"" is a melancholy piece of jazz/pop. Overall, the songs on this album are well written, and well performed by the unique frontman whose name escapes me. I recommend this album."
4,"Not Radical, Just Rocking","This is the album The Rolling Stones would have made if they still had their own blood in their veins. As a matter of fact, the opening riff of the opening song is reminiscent of that all-timer ""Sympathy for the Devil"". The first two cuts are so good, so brash and energetic, we'll forgive them for slowing down slightly on the subsequent tracks. This band, which apparently exists no longer and which may not have really been an actual band, is the brainchild of one Gregg Alexander. Mr. Alexander sings, writes,arranges, and produces real good and his song titles and lyrics display a wit frequently absent from serious rock and roll. We hope this guy has not disappeared from the music scene for long."
3,One Hit Wonder,"I heard a tune and loved it. I could not get the tune out of my mind. In search of, I called my local college station WVUM and hummed a few bars. Remarkably enough it was immediately identified as ""You Get What You Give."" The female DJ referred to the New Radicals as the ""One Hit Wonder."" This puzzled me.Well the one song is truly exceptional but now I understand the DJ's tag. The rest of the CD is not bad, and there are a couple of songs that I like, but this CD is Exhibit ""A"" for a CD-RW machine."
3,Not for Pre-teens!,"Yes, they do have an appealing beat, but they have some lyrics that have offensive language. I bought this CD for my 11 year old son, after previewing the 3 sample songs that were available from a retail store. When I gave it to him, I asked to preview the album in its entirety and found the music great, but there are a couple of songs that have lyrics not appropriate for a pre-teen. Further, the CD comes with complete set of the lyrics for the kids to read. Needless to say, the album is now mine, and not for him. Amazon needs to take this off its recommendation list for Ages 9 - 12!"
4,Fun post modern empty pop rock,"America has produced the act that carries on from World Party in a shameless celebration of 101 influences from the late 60's and the early 70's devoid of much meaning other than joy. If you love this, you must listen to World Party."
3,That '70s Album? Yeah...,"I really would like to enjoy this album, but I can't. Why? Well, for starters all the songs have the same or similar sounding melodies. Not to say those melodies are bad. Another problem is many of the songs have distinct hooks but after awhile the songs themselves tend to lose themselves in a haze. Gregg Alexander starts the album out with five-to-six minute songs and by the final song has three-to-four minute songs. I have the feeling he gave out by track 7 (the title track),which explains the lost of ""energy."" The title track itself has some great lyrics, it just would be nice if Gregg would SING them. If you want something new, get Ben Folds Five's latest. If you want something radical, get David S. Ware's ""Go See The World,"" Portishead's ""Portishead,"" and any of the Velvet Underground."
2,Maybe You've Been Brainwashed into buying this CD,"When I first heard the song You Get What You Give, I thought it was such a powerful, and attention-grabbing song. I wanted to know all about the band, and the album. I got the album for Christmas of 98, and I must say that I was very disappointed with it. Despite the fact that You Get What You Give is a great song, the rest of the album sounds nothing like that one. They're not as upbeat, and they sound like a completely different genre than its popular track. My advice: save your money for a better CD."
5,Cool and hip.,The CD is fun pop that has nuthin but variety and is one hell of a good CD. Get it and u wont be sorry. These guys are talented. Hope they arent just one hit wonders cuz they have alot of potential.
5,Fresh and Alive! This is a must-own...,"Despite the fact that so many people seem to enjoy bashing them, piano pop bands such as Ben Folds Five, The Counting Crows, and now New Radicals have carved themselves a fantastic little niche in the business with their ten-finger piano chords, sometimes preposterous lyrics, and band members that play in a very intense way. The music quality is excellent, and I find this to be a very fun album, especially for long car rides. Listen intently to the lyrics, and Gregg's amazing way with the ""Story song"" will suck you in quickly. Gregg's voice has an amazing emotional quality, and he does an excellent job of putting you in the picture. This is one of the very few albums that stay in my car at all times ;) If you like BF5 and other piano pop, this is a definite must-own!"
5,"The 90's weren't too good, with the exception of this","This is what music should be. Straightforward without being boring or dated, intelligent lyrics, and positive messages. Sequencers and sampling had overtaken the 90's to the point where I didn't like the majority of what came out.The warm,natural feeling of real instruments was gone in favor of people who had very little talent and really COULDNT play an instrument.When I first heard You Get What You Give, I thought ""Wow, that's a great song, I'll buy the CD and hope for the best"" This album takes a little bit of time to sink in, but if you keep listening to it,and reading the lyrics along with each song, you will love it all except the title track. Now the reason I bought the CD, is actually my least favorite track. Flowers is a heartfelt piece, as well as Hope I DIdnt Just Give Away The Ending.Listen to this a few songs at a time, and it will become one of your faves."
5,Extremely under-rated album!,"I bought this album in the late 90s, after hearing ""You get what you Give"". I was surprised to find that the entire album is great, which I cannot say for many albums. But the most surprising thing is that 9 years later I think it is even better than I did back then, as pure entertainment, which I can say for precious few other albums. A great little slice of the late 90s pop alt rock scene, generally under-rated by the critics!! All the songs are good."
5,One of my favorite CDs of all time,"This CD is my the most emotional disc i own. it's ability to touch me simply hasn't been matched by anything else i have. Mr Alexander's heart and soul comes through in every song, and it is just an experience to revel in."
2,Where is Todd Rundgren,"Some of the stuff ain't too bad, but most of it has been done. When I first heard the single, I thought it was Todd Rundgren. Talk about borrowing!"
4,OH SO OVERATED?,"I heard it on the Scobby Doo 2 Soundtrack and then I looked up "" New Radicals"". I thought I was one of the few people in the world who knew who didn't really hear of New Radicals. Needless to say, I was wrong. Why so underated? It has powerful lyrics. Good about average for a cd, I guess, number of good songs. And he is one of the hottest singers in the world, yes!"
4,Great songs!!!,"THIS COMPACT DISC HAS MANY GOOD SONGS ON IT. NEW RADICALS SING GREAT AND THE LYRICS ARE MEANINFUL ABOUT LIFE. THE TITLE ""MABYE YOU BEEN BRAINWASHED TOO"" DEALS WITH CONFLITAL ISSUES IN TODAYS SOCIETY."
2,I FOUND THE ALBUM TO BE KIND OF BLAND AT FIRST.,"IT STARTED OFF AS AN UP BEAT TEMPO, THEN IT SLOWED DOWN WAY TOO MUCH. AFTER LISTENING TO IT FOR THE FIFTYITH TIME IT STARTED TO GROW ON ME. THIS IS AN ALBUM FOR ""MTV"" CARSON DAILY GROUPIES. FOR YOU TRUE MUSIC LOVERS THIS IS AN ALBUM YOU WILL REGRET BUYING...."
5,"If life was set to music, these would be the tunes.","I heard ""Get What You Give"" on the radio and was entranced. I watched the video on MTV and was amused. I listened to the CD and was mesmerized. The lyrics and the tunes set the pace for an enjoyable day and an inspirational message. At a record store earlier today, I found this CD at a listening station and indulged myself in the midst of hectic holiday shopping. I was transported to a peaceful place as I watched the shoppers around me floated by, almost in slow-motion. If someone made a movie about the magic of the people and life around me, this would be the soudtrack for a surreal, enlightening experience that really gives you something to think about."
2,"A great idea, but......","Gregg Alexander came to the table with some great ideas and a lot of musical talent. What he did NOT have is any kind of coherence or follow through. He takes all kinds of styles, hooks and phrases, tosses them in a bucket and adds a hand grenade. This CD represents what splattered against the wall. In terms of production, it is excellent, but he seems to be buying time throughout most of the songs. Many of the songs seem to be vehicles for catchy chops and maybe a clever line or rhyme. If I was a trusted friend of his, I would tell him to trim the CD by half and work on finishing the songs."
1,"Please, make it stop.","This has to be one of the fluffiest, most pretentious, and insubstantial CDs I've ever heard. I'm deeply thankful I didn't buy this tripe, especially after hearing the overplayed ""Get What You Give"". While this band clearly has musical talent, the songs are too cutesy and repetitive to tolerate for more than say, 5 seconds. With time, they might be able to pull together something more creative, but for now, let's just give them some nice parting gifts and thank them for being on the show."
2,Sugar rush,"2 1/2This briefly popular late 90's mainstream-alternative disc undoubtedly started too strong for its own good, continuing to nosedive into mediocrity immediately after the energetic starter and eventually apathetically flatlines altogether."
4,Recommended for the Verve fans.,"This cd reminds me very much of the Verve's cd- Urban Hymns. Allthought it has a little more variety, the style of music is very simmilar."
4,Delicious Pop!,"For me this CD is irresistable, delicious, infectious pop music. It feels so good listening to it, especially in the summertime. It almost seems too good to be true, I love it. I am a huge fan of World Party, so at times it is much too eerie to hear strong similarities. Oh well. It is still getting lots of play and will continue to."
3,"Mostly slow, drug-induced songs, but not bad.","I bought this album hoping it would be full of ""You Get What You Give""s, but unfortunately not. The only other fast-paced song on the album is ""Mother we just can't get enough"". ""Someday we'll know"", ""Jehovah made this whole joint for you"" and ""In need of a miracle"" are semi-upbeat, but all the others are slow and about drugs. This album is not for kids, buddies. If you want a really, really good album, get ""Where have all the merrymakers gone?"" by Harvey Danger."
4,i've been brainwashed too!,good cd i'm really enjoying it and it arrived on time and in good condition. great price too!
3,Its a decent pop CD,"Its not the best I ever heard, but I didn't take it out of my CD player either. I agree with the others that he is pretentious. He for some odd reason reminds me of the Cure. Call me crazy. Overall this is a decent pop CD. It won't make it into my constant rotation, but it is one of those CD's that you rediscover every once and a while on rainy days. Buy it, don't buy it. I don't really care."
3,An okay CD. But only okay.,"I got this cd as a gift, and initially I laughed. I really liked ""You Get What You Give"" after hearing it on the radio, but I had been told that this cd sucks overall. After listening to it a couple of times, I was pleasantly surprised. I actually liked it. Not that it is anything amazing. The New Radicals aren't that talented. But it was a ""feel good"" cd. But after listening to it a few more times, I got sick of it very quickly. The more times I listen to this cd the worse it gets. It's not all bad, but I can't even listen to the entire duration of ""I Hope I Didn't Just Give Away the Ending"" or ""I Don't Wanna Die Anymore."" They are SO whiney. ""You Get What You Give"" is still one of my favorite songs, and other songs such as ""Jehovah Made This Whole Joint for You,"" ""Gotta Stay High,"" and ""Crying Like A Church On Monday"" are decent.To sum it up, this is a good cd if you listen to it once every six months. Maybe it only deserves 2 stars?"
1,neither new or radical.,"Save yor cash and buy Frank Zappa's, Joe's Garage(or whatever by him) if you want to hear something radical."
5,Great new band with lyrics to match the infectious music.,"The New Radicals provide a batch of new songs that are catchy to listen to at first. Upon further examination, they've written good lyrics to go with it making for songs that grow on you every time you hear them. ""You Get What You Give"" and ""Someday We'll Know"" are the standouts. Can't wait to see them live!"
4,Todd Ezra Wallinger's latest solo album,"OK, Gregg Alexander is pompous as all get-out for acting as though he is above Courtney Love or Beck or Hanson, BUT a little bit of blatant arrogance doesn't hurt -- maybe he laughs about it, too.Yeah, the World Party aspect is evident to the point where Karl can sue. Sure, the Rundgren factor runs throughout -- but I swear I though the first single was done by a very different version of Better Than Ezra than I had heard before. The previous reviewer who said that a listener can play ""Spot the influence"" has it right.Heck, just buy the CD because it's not MOPEY. As copycattish and cynical as Alexander can be, he has at least lifted pop music for one brief shining moment out of the angst pit -- or, at least it sounds that way."
5,Super Album!!!!,This album surprised the h... out of me! It a solid album with great music. Some albums have one or two good songs and the rest is filing but not this one... A must for music lovers...
2,Fast Start...then lame,"First two songs are great, then the rest of the CD is the same old whiney songs that all sound the same."
5,LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I love this cd. I heard them first on z104 and have loved them ever since!!!!!!!!!!! I can really relate to many of the lyrics such as ""Don't give up you got a reason to live"""
5,one of the best albums I've heard,"Inspired, grandiose, and consistent. Amazing piece of work.. I only wish more was available by this group."
2,World Party? Todd Rundgren?,"Some decent songs, but comparisons to World Party and Todd Rundgren are superficial at best. This album is extremely shallow. I've tried to like this record (after spending on it) though I only tire of it further. Looking for something creative and profound, look elsewhere."
2,2 Good Songs,How can a band which can produce songs of the quality of 'You get what you give' and 'Someday We'll know' also make songs of the mediocrity of most of the other 10 songs on this albumn.Disappointed.........
1,Talk about a poser!,"Okay, the name of the band/project immediately told me that I might not like it. But I get beyond that to check it out. The album cover was truely disturbing and annoying, but hey, you can't judge a book by its cover, right? So he gets one star for being as predictable as he was, because that's sometimes not very easy to come by. Some bands try to fool you by having a lame album cover and name, but give you great material. Others just suck, musically, but have great art directors. Well, New Radicals go all the way bad, with a tired album title as well! This guy couldn't brainwash me with a bone saw and a loofah. It's kind of sad that it actually going around and people are really digging it, but I guess to each's own. If Alanis can do it (or have it done for her as the case may be,) so can her technical equivalent, New Radicals."
1,"First I listined, then I laughed 'til I cried","Its not hard to see why there is only one ""radical"" in the new radicals. I'm sorry to say it, but this music wasn't cool in the eighties. I noticed the interesting use of drug symbolism, both positive and negative... A particularly interesting song is ""Jehovah made this whole joint for you"" somehow it manages to sum up the entire albums problems, It's too long and its too [bad]!!!"
4,"A fine debut, with some clearly major influences","Well, I keep listening to tracks 4, 6, and 12, and can't help but hear the terrific influence Jagger must have had on Gregg, and that's good. I just turned 35, and it brings me back to a few summers of great memories in the mid-late 70's when I first heard the Stones and Jaggers voice. I have always believed that there's nothing new under the sun - you take your influences and make them work for you - and that's what Gregg has done. They work for me on this! PS: track 6 reminds me of someone I used to know too......."
5,GREAT ALBUM,"For those of you who said the CD was terrible, you only listened to the samples amazon provided. All of the songs are wonderful. This is the best CD that I have bought in years."
5,"Funky, funky off-beats and interesting vocals!!",This CD is just so funky. It's pretty great. I loved it. Very textured. Layered and off-beat.
4,Good CD with some GREAT songs,"When I first heard the song ""You Get what you give"" I liked it.. but then when I heard ""Someday We'll Know"" I loved it.. That is one of the best songs ever.. Too bad the band broke up...:("
3,Someday you'll know.,"This is another one of those discs I see everytime I go to the used store, but I can't understand why. It's really quite good, with a positive vibe, and well worth the money you can easily find it for. I'll admit that ""You Get What You Give"" is the high point, but the rest is very similar in pace and feel. I believe ""Someday We'll Know"" was another single. Maybe a hard group to catagorize, but I'd call it groovy alt-pop, with a punk mentality. They almost remind me of some of the Mad-Chester bands from the early 90's. The singer does a great job, he's not afraid to let loose, and his voice fits the music well. Though I like the whole disc, they'll probably always be known for the one song. At least it's a killer tune with a great video."
4,Amazing,"The New Radicals CD ""Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too"" has a rare unique quality difficult to find in pop. Gregg Alexander's voice really has an ability to reach you deep down to your core. When I first heard ""Get What You Give"", I instantly loved it. I assumed the album would be an up-beat poppish collection of music, however when I bought it, I was pleasantly surprised to find much more variety of music than one would expect after hearing that single song. ""Flowers"", ""I Hope I Didn't Just Give Away The Ending"", and ""I Don't Wanna Die Anymore"" are my particular favorites, because his voice carries the songs so well and when you listen to them, they hold a very personal quality. It is really a shame that Gregg Alexander is not singing for the band anymore, I have not yet heard a male voice that is as unique and soulful as his. If you don't own this CD, give it a chance, listen a few times, read along with the lyrics, and I believe you will get to treasure it as much as I do."
5,Truly Elegant Engagement Calendar from Universe,"Having begun purchasing National Gallery of Art Engagement Calendars from Universe in 2002, the 2006 edition is my choice again for the 5th year in a row! This elegant product features 56 handsomely printed details of masterpieces from the collection of the Washington DC National Gallery of Art -- one for each week of the year. The approximately 6.5"" by 9"" format is the perfect size -- neither too small nor too large. When opened to a particular week, there is a space for each day's agenda -- Monday thru Sunday -- on one page and a superbly reproduced detail of a work of art on the facing page. For art devotees as well as others I heartily recommend this beautifully executed publication."
1,Just awful,"Bought this monitor for my wife's computer, and it died within a month. No response - ever - from X2Gen's customer support despite repeated emails and attempts to get through on the phone. Also had a couple dead BRIGHT RED pixels straight out of the box, first time I've personally had that on an LCD but probably not unheard of. Not worth the money you save, I'll buy a real brand next time."
4,very good ant repelent,This product works very well. My ants were gone within 3 days after I sprinkled it in the entry areas.
5,AWESOME TIME SAVER AND PROBLEM SOLVER,"This item is well worth getting. It saves time and lets you align your waterWater Pump Pulley Spacerpump pulley exactly with other pulleys to keep them inline and you will not lose your belt at higher rpm's or wear it out prematurely...If you have a sixties or seventies muscle car, you will like this. Great for custome engine builds too.."
2,Terrible screen house,"Great only if you are wanting to use this for a day of camping, and then take it down. Just hope it doesn't rain! The water comes right through. Also, if any water gets on it, the whole thing will collapse, snapping the weak bars, and puncturing the tent and screening on the way down. Not worth the price."
3,"The arbor is nice, but I am a little disappointed","As soon as I received the package I went into my yard to set it up. The set up is fairly simple however I would recommend having two people it makes the job much easier. The construction seems sturdy; however, it wasn't windy and I know that has been a problem for others.My irritation does not come with the product itself but its condition upon arrival. When I received the package, the box was crunched in and soggy on one side. Upon inspection I feel it is clear that this arbor has been previously used or atleast opened. If that was the case, I feel it should have been clear before purchase. The corners appeared to have a little dirt as well as the main arbor. The screen seemed to have a few snags; no holes, but still.It is clear that I was not the first person to have ever owned or set up this particular arbor. I hope this is an isolated incident.Again. Nice, but I am still disappointed."
5,screen tent,The screen tent is great . We had alittle wind storm here recently and the screen tent held up nicely :}
2,You get what you paid for...,"This is definately the lowest priced screened arbor out there, and the quality matches that price. The poles are very thin metal and wouldn't stand up on their own, so it was a trick to get the whole frame together and then stretch the screen over that. One of the zippers has already started to come apart when zipped up, so I doubt it will last very long. If we get more than one season out of this, I'll be surprised."
5,good for class,I bought this for a class that I was taking. It worked well. I like doing things online but I preferred the hard copy workbook because I would not be tied to being online. Definitely would recommend this workbook.
4,wonderful,I order this Spanish worbook/lab manuel. Has been shipped fast and the condition was perfect!
2,Has Lab work but not in class Workbook pages,"This was what I was looking for but the only thing it lacked was the ""in class"" workbook pages for the class room. If your instructor uses the ""in class"" pages of the workbook, you will not find them in this Workbook/labratory Manuel. My instructor uses the ""in class"" pages!!!"
1,Workbook/Lab Manual Vol. 1 to accompany Que tal?,Very skimpy little pre-released manual of actual Workbook. Don't buy this unless you think you want to save money when in fact you'll lose money if you don't buy the real workbook.
3,Una introducción a las señas usadas por personas sordas,Good introduction to signed english adapted to spanish.... Not recomended to learn ASL... Ayuda a aprender signos y expresiones pero no enseña el lenguaje de señas americano...
5,A Mixture,"Mixture of classic writers that were pretty deep. Truthfully some of the classic writers were over my head (Plato, Aristotle, John Dewey, etc.). The rest of the book was more contemporary with essays from a culturally diverse population of writers. I had to buy it for a Philosopy of Ed. class and managed to get by with an A, but some of the classic writer's I'd like to read again, and again (since I probably won't get what in the heck they're saying the first time around). Something to put on your summer reading list for professional enrichment."
2,Classic and Contemporary Readings in the Philosophy of Education,"Many of the readings are interesting and easy to understand, but a lot of the selections are difficult and take some time to think through."
4,"It's Plastic, But Adequate","Yeah, this thing is plastic, and it will crack if you try to tighten the screws too tight, and it is the same thing you can buy at the auto parts store. But, it does what it's supposed to do and looks good. Once it's on the car, you can't tell it's plastic by looking at it. Also, I cracked it by overtightening a screw, but even the cracks aren't noticeable. This will do until I find a better alternative."
5,perfect,This plate cover is the perfect darkness. Not enough to get pulled over (unless you run into a **** cop) but still enough to look cool on your black vehicle. Only bad thing is it doesn't come with the black license plate screws so I had to spray paint some.
2,Fragile,"The bubble feature makes this product quite vulnerable to damage. I also purchased the flat version and it has held up well. This one lasted 3 days before it broke into pieces. If you live in a place where there is lots of street parking (NY), then this is probably not recommended for an exposed license plate."
4,License Plate Cover,"I saw this same license plate cover at an auto parts store for 3x the price so I already knew I was getting a great deal with Amazon, even if it isn't excellent quality I still got it for cheap. It's basically a tinted hard plastic cover which is exactly what I wanted. If you're looking for something very professional this is not for you."
5,Fantastic,"This is a fantastic cover for the money. It is not like one of those flimsy thin plastic pieces of junk this is the real deal. It fits nice, it darkens well but not enough to get a ticket and, it protects my plates from damage. Highly recommended for anyone that wants to protect there plates and look cool doing it."
2,THERE ARE CHEAR ONES ELSE WHERE!!!,"I bought this thinking it's one of a kind... WRONG!! If you want to buy one of these, go to your local auto parts store, like Auto Zone, they are much cheaper than this one on Amazon, and you don't have to pay for shipping!! They also have the black screws, and covers for the screws to go with this smoke license plate cover."
5,Fascinating,"I had seen a segment on A&E about this shocking and brutal crime. Reading the book made me realize just how deceptive and evil human beings can be, not only to their closest friends and business associates but to those who matter the most; their families.This will forever change the way I look at my pastor in the pulpit!"
3,"Great Story, Sloppy Execution...","I lived in the Philadelphia area when this story broke back in '94. The Rabbi always looked guilty--but I moved away before the story really got good. This book filled me in on what I missed and what a story it is. A fascinating story, filled with absorbing and tragic characters. I thought the book, while well researched, was not well written. The structure is a bit sloppy and some the stories that appear as interludes are only tangentially related (like someone who knew someone who vaguely remembered Neulander in the '60s). I might have chosen a more straight forward narrative, but oh well...the story carries the day. And finally, justice."
5,A page-turning true crime story that reads like a novel,"Arthur Magida has done a fantastic job of bringing the details and motivations behind a shocking crime to light. Far more than a journalist's recounting of events, the author sheds valuable insight on the meaning of faith, congregation, community, and spiritual leadership. He skillfully weaves the facts of the crime and investigation with the disturbing details of the Rabbi's narcissistic, sociopathic personality traits. The reader is taken inside the congregation and made to understand how Rabbi Neulander captivated an entire congregation, seduced several of its members, and came to believe he was above the laws of man. A captivating story from beginning to end that forces us to look inside and to question those in whom we place our faith and trust."
5,This book is 100% on target,"I am a freshman at Keene State College located in New Hampshire. Although I haven't had much experience in the business environment, I find everything in this book to be very helpful and completely true. I have never been a big fan of reading, but I can honestly say this book is hard to put down if you take an interest in management. This down-to-earth, humane view of management makes complete sense and I am ambitious to get out in the world and apply all of my new knowledge.BUY THIS BOOK!"
2,Practice hand,"The fingers are a good distance apart. But I was looking for a hand with more flexiblity, when I take my state board in nail technology."
5,BEST healthy cookbook out there!,"After years of searching, I have finally found the BEST cookbook for quick, healthy, AND yummy recipes!"
1,Beginners Only,I got this because it was listed as for Advanced programmers. But it does little more the walk through some very simple examples of the basic database issues of Delphi. If you are a beginner and need some hand holding to get you started on topics you already have a detailed explanation on. Then this book might help. But don't expect to learn much from it by itself. I would get a copy cheap from someone experienced that got suckered in to buying it.
2,Not up to The Tomes of Delphi Standard,"I was dissapointed with this book because I was looking for an advanced book on the BDE and got a beginners guide.This book should not even be considered as part of the Tomes Series...maybe a beginning series. This is not to say that this book is not worthy of buying, because it is if you are a beginner and wanting to learn the ropes of the BDE and SQL."
2,For database developer's,"In spite of the quality of others books of THE TOMES OF DELPHI, this book is not I hope of a ADVANCED book for programmers. This book is very good to programmers that are beginning. If you are wanting a TRUE ADVANCED book for Database Developing , Please look for others options in this catalog."
5,excellent book for database with delphi,"I really like this book.I am teaching delphi in an institute Infolearn, Houston, texas. I wanted to prescribe this book to my students.I want a copy of it for a better idea.my addressNarsim kasaru 2305, Bay Area Blvd, Houston, Texas - 77058"
1,misleading picture,Picture looks like it covers the whole front floor area. This mat only covers the hump area. For what I paid for this you would think it would be like the old mats that went from the drivers to passenger floorboards. Way too much money for this.
3,Interesting,"Generation is a collection of sci-fi short stories by ""up and coming"" authors. I put the quotes around up and coming, because some of the authors weren't that new even then. The book was a whole lot of crack. It was compiled in 1969 and you could tell. A lot of the stories dealt with sex or drugs or both. Some of them were really good, others weren't and a couple were just confusing."
5,Photos have great color & clarity. Optical zoom not a big deal.,"I recently took this lil cam on a trip overseas and am extremely happy with the pictures that it took. Color and clarity are top notch, what I expect from Canon. It's very compact and easy to carry around. Just be sure it's in a safe pocket or bag, you wouldn't want to leave it behind.The SD10 does lack optical zoom, which is advantageous in some ways. It's easier to use (no zoom controls to fiddle with) so strangers can just point & shoot in those situations when you want a picture of yourself. ""Zoom with your feet"". Not having to fiddle with zoom controls also makes for quicker shooting. Use a paint program afterwards to crop what you want to keep in the pic.This isn't a replacement for a full-sized digicam. But it sure gives them a run for their money. I wouldn't take any other cam on a long trip. The charger is universal 100-240v 50/60Hz, so no power converter is necessary (just a plug adapter depending on where you're going)."
3,"Small and decent, but no longer a good buy","I bought this when it first came out a couple of years ago. At the time it was the smallest 4MP out there, and since my goal was to go ""small,"" i decided that i could live without an optical zoom. While it served me well, I will tell anyone now that we all need optical zoom. Photographic quality is good, though there are sometimes too much chromatic aberration (color fringing). Focus indoors can be slow or impossible, even with flash turned on.Unless you can get a really good deal for this, I suggest looking elsewhere, as there are many other offerings from this class of cameras now -- all with zoom lenses. I recommend the recent Casios or a Pentax Optio."
4,Still use it to this very day,Ive had this camera for quite a few years now. Its is a very handy camera to have due to its size. It also shoots quickly (probably due to no optical zoom) and shoots decent pictures. This is a no nonsense camera. Straight point and shoot anyone can use it. I like how small it is cause you can truly take it anywhere. As they say the best camera is the one you have with you. Is very cheap on ebay if you want one. This or the sd20 which is the improved version.
2,Scrapbooking with Lisa Bearnson: The Best of QVC Page Layouts,"Extremely disappointing. Dated layouts, particularly simple, too. Apparently there was a free album which originally came with the book - I did not get this, buying it secondhand from a dealer. I have Vol 2 and Vol 5, and these were far superior publications."
4,Gotta take the good with the bad ^.^,"For all anime fans new to the shonen ai world, Gravi is definitely a good place to start. But watch the anime before you read the manga or it will drive you nuts!! I know they couldn't stuff everything into the TV series, but they left out a ton of good stuff (Like the entire first half of manga Vol.1) Despite that, the animation and character design are fantastic and the story is both humorous and touching. I really have to agree on the dubbed voices... some are good and some are just awful. The worst part is that there's hardly and diversity among the voices, some of them sound so similar to eachother, you'd swear it was the same V.A. Thoma's voice is a huge improvement over the Japanese voice! He actually sounds like a 31-year-old instead of a 15-year-old. This is totally worth buying, but then go back and read the manga for the full story!"
4,Great show,"Now, I can't speak specifically about this DVD release (eg. whether they did a good job on subtitles, extra features, etc), but I've seen the whole show and it is FABULOUS. I can say that this is hands-down the best shounen-ai anime I've ever seen, and I've seen my fair share.If you've already read the manga, you'll find that the feel of the show is quite different. It's a lot funnier, and Shuichi is way zanier (and cuter!). Even if you didn't like the manga, I'd say give this a try, because it's WAY better (and it's not often I feel that way - I usually prefer the manga).Pretty much my only beef with this DVD release is the value aspect. The show only has 13 episodes (a tragedy, trust me), but it is being released on four disks, with a MSRP of $29.99US each. You can get it a little cheaper (like here on Amazon ^_^), but STILL! When will companies catch on that DVDs will hold more than three or four episodes..."
2,"Love the manga, but as a DVD a bit disappointed","One thing that irks me is how much the animated version differs from the book (I know a certain amount of changes have to be made to accomodate differnt mediums or whatever, but this is too much. I also didn't like that it was like practically $30 and it only had three short episodes. I normally would have waited to buy it until it was cheaper, but I wanted to check out whether they were even worth the wait or not. My recommendation is wait for a sale or something if you decide you want to buy it."
5,Robodoc is a great Saturday Night Beer & Pretzels movie!,"Hilarious! Must see comedy. Lawyer vs Doctors vs Insurance Companies.The lawyer, Jake Gorman, is hysterical! Great Saturday night beer & pretzels movie! Very Funny! Must see!"
4,very funny,"When I first read the reviews of this movie I figured it wasn't going to be very good. However, after having seen it, I was pleasently surprised. This is supposed to be a raunchy comedy and it hits the mark. It kind of reminded me of an old movie from the 1980's ""Young Doctors In Love"". If you liked that movie, then you'll like this one. Seeing some actors from old tv shows also added to my enjoyment."
5,"Nicely Done Movie, Stellar Visual Effects!","Robodoc is a good movie! It has a comedic storyline, great actors and the visual effects rock! Check it out..."
3,Handy for some stubborn pins,"If you've got a stubborn pin that REALLY needs some juice to get moving, then these aren't bad- but I'd just as soon use a very sturdy pointed brass drift. These will seriously ding up a pin and scratch the surface if they slip."
4,Classic DOS style graphics,This intersting resource management game with old looking graphics thatgive the game an interesting look that no longer exists in theworld of modern gaming. The graphics are low resolution butfunctional.I also like the fact that the game is not about blowing things up.Prices are still reasonable so get yourself a copy before theyall get taken by collectors. I think the developers eventuallywent on to produce The Jupiter Incident so its fascinating tosee how the graphics went from low resolution spinning planetsto the smooth graphics in The Jupiter Incident.You need to have the disks in the CD drive for this game towork and DOSBOX to run on a modern OS.
3,An oldie but a goodie,"I played this game on Windows 95 when I was younger. It has basically no replay value (always the same, no multi-player) and a few tricks can let you win reasonably fast. Despite this, the game is fairly fun. It has a bit of a sense of humor. The 3D cut-scenes are dated but I feel the 2D of most of the game looks and feels great, better graphics then its all 3D sequel. It's a good choice if you're looking for an old DOS game to while away a week or two, and I got it for about ten bucks total, so it was worth reliving.IMPORTANT: This is a DOS game, it needs Windows 95/98 or DosBox. Dos Box is a free DOS emulator, it is a bit finicky but you can get it to run in Dos Box. I might've recommended just copying the whole CD onto your hard drive, but the program does have some form of protection, the game will look for it to be in the drive."
2,Caution!: Excellent production but defective DVDs,"As always these productions are excellent and tasteful.The guys are attractive and...attractive.The issue I had is that my DVD, ordered as a gift, came defective.It would not play the last 1/4 of the film.I reordered another copy which came immediately but it too was defective....still no luck finding a phone number for Amazon."
3,Hot Men Teaser,Mainly behind the scene footage of making/shooting the anual calendar of these gorgeous men. A few of them show frontal but most are not. I bought this DVD as an inspirational material since I am a photographer. It's well worth the price I paid.
3,Results,"Though the upper part of the Ouroboros face was messed up to a visible point (being the only upsetting part because it cheapened it), overall, the general detail of the pendant was alright. It surprised me that the size of the pendant was that of a quarter (take or add), which I actually liked, because I couldn't imagine wearing a huge thing. Delivery was very quick and the packaging was professionally done."
4,BEST KEPT SECRET IN THE U.S. !!!!,"Since seeing this great band live several times I have bought 4 of their albums but I think this is the best one I have. Tim ""too slim"" Langford is a great guitar player with tons of energy. Tee shirt says ""Straight Whiskey Blues With A Southern Rock Beer Chaser"" Great way to describe their music. I recomend you buy this album and if you get a chance to see them live, don't pass it up!"
1,I Got Conned,"It's a quirky description and an interesting cover...but the book is terrible. The writing is stilted and amateur and reads more like a barebones outline than a finished and published book. I read better fanfiction on the net anyday.The main character is a spineless, boring girl who I just can't feel sorry for. The rest of the characters are also overdrawn stereotypes without any human characteristics. This book occurs like a movie by a film school director trying to be ""different"".Don't bother. I probably won't even finish it. If you want to try, I'll send it to for the cost of postage."
2,Why?,"This was one of the most confusing, frustrating and entirely unsatisfying books I have ever read. I have adored this series and struggled along with Cherijo to trust Reever and to learn to love him. In one book not only is Cherijo's memory wiped out but so is her love and trust for Reever. Just wait until you read ""Plague of Memory"" *shiver*. I'm not done with it yet but I'm praying for a better out come than this one had.I am hoping that Ms Viehl knows what she is doing and things get back to semi-normalcy soon."
3,Disappointing installment in an otherwise great series,"Although I've read an enjoyed all the other ""Stardoc"" novels, this one left me a bit ""cold"" (for more reasons than just Akkabarr's surface temperature). The multiple shifting timelines and viewpoints and a muddy conclusion really detracted from the readability of this book. Also, in my opinion, Cherijo Grey Veil is the interesting character in this series - by not having her viewpoint represented, the author really did a disservice. The book is not ""bad"" per se, but it certainly is a lowpoint in the series. For die hard fans, it's worth the read to keep up with the story arc, but otherwise, it's forgettable."
5,Rebel Ice: A Stardoc Novel,I have been an S.L. Viehl fan for many years. This has been a fascinating series to follow through the many books.
3,What happened?,"I picked up the first Stardoc book at Barnes and Noble the other day, and I've been hooked ever since. But now the main character who held everything together, the person whose quirky acts and thoughts and words amused and entertained me so much, is gone. The body is there, but not the memories, and while I appreciated Duncan's devotion despite that, I'm really disappointed. Before, he and Cherijo had finally worked out how their marriage should work, and I really wanted to see them truly working together. I'm sorry, but the whole ""Now I'm Jarn, I don't remember and don't care about you"" thing really turned me off. I'm not sure if what made this book so disappointing was having the really good previous series, but I sure hope that Viehl has somewhere that this is supposed to be going, and not just a grasping way to extend the storyline."
2,"What happened, Viehl?","I have been an avid fan of SL Viehl since the first book but was this written by Viehl? The plot was all over the place and there was no Cherijo. If Viehl wanted to start fresh with this series, there was a better way to go about it. In addition, this book did not further the whole Cherijo inception mystery. It was truly disappointing."
3,"Another fascinating, but unfortunate read","For those hungry to read more of the exploits of Cherijo, well, you'll be sadly disappointed. The novel focuses more on Reever's desperate search for his wife, and entanglement with the politics on the planet, and even more on Tuelon, the last of the Hado clan, as he seeks vengeance on whomever he can get his hands upon. The underlying story is the identity of the woman with no memory and her search for survival.""Well-drawn cultures and fascinating aliens are marred by busy point-of-view shifts and a trick ending that confuses more than illuminates."" This is too true. Without giving spoilers, I felt quite disappointed in the end--I felt completely unnecessary. And I'll feel sorry for Cherijo in upcoming novels, because, no matter what, she'll still be hunted.Overall, a poor ending. The twist was confusing to the point of nonsensical."
3,Disappointed but not giving up yet,"I was terribly excited when this Stardoc book came out and snapped it up to read. At first I was more than a little confused when I started to read, and actually thought I had missed a book in between. But ok, I got over it, was actually starting to enjoy the unusual storyline when wham, bam what a disappointing ending. There is absolutely NO CLOSURE to this book. My only hope is that Ms. Viehl has something in mind that needed such a drastic turn of events for the series to continue. I'm not ready to give up on this series like some, because it is one of the most original and best written sci-fi series out there, but this book may be a necessary evil."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money,"... [T]he tapes are very frustrating, the pace moves to quickly, they do not give you enough time to respond (if is very frustrating when the narrator asks me to respond in Spanish & then he starts talking before I am anywhere near finishing -- it is not easy to pause the tape while driving -- other tapes I have used give enough time to respond & think) & the English speaking narrator is annoying -- may be useful as a supplement or for someone who is brushing up in Spanish -- but terrible for someone who is trying to LEARN the language."
5,Dr Suess is great on many levels!,"I bought this for my 3 year old daughter because I remembered when they used to show us the Sneetches film in grade school to illustrate how ridiculous prejudice can be. She liked that story fine, but her favorite is What was I Scared of? because the pants with nobody inside spooks her a little and facinates her. You can't go wrong with a book from Dr Suess!"
5,Great use for social emotional literacy,"In my school district we talk a lot about social, emotional literacy. This book is great in showing students that differences and individuality is what makes everyone unique and exciting. I used this book with seventh grade students and they loved the fact that I was reading them a storybook. For many students it has been so long since an adult has read them a storybook but I feel it is important to continue to model how to read fluently."
1,More Liberal Propaganda,"In Sneetches we are asked to sympathize with the star-less Sneetches, who are seeking special rights because they aren't invited to parties. Instead of throwing a party themselves or maybe getting a job, the star-less Sneetches just mope around on the beach. Eventually the starred Sneetches let the star-less ones participate in the parties, but only after every last dollar is spent and the economy has crashed.Who is the 'bad guy' in the story? Why it's the entrepreneur, the business owner, the one person who appears to have a job......of course.This is the most insidious form of liberal propaganda -- the kind that sneaks up on children. While Doctor Seuss (who wasn't a real Doctor) wrote many a book that teaches wholesome values, his works are interspersed with liberal propaganda, like this book and the Lorax, which should be avoided like the liberal plague."
5,One of the best.......,"This Dr. Seuss offering I read to my own children 25 yrs. ago, and now my grandchildren are enjoying this book, as well. These stories are less non-sensical, yet convey a message in a whimsical way. Our kids ESPECIALLY like the pale green pants story, and when my 7 yr. old granddaughter read it to ME the other night, I could say it right along with her......I've read it so many times, I know it by heart!! I highly recommend this particular Dr. Seuss book."
5,Great price for a Dr. Seuss classic,"Very glad to get this book. It was a great price. It is a wonderful book to use for diversity education classes. Kids love it and to be honest, so do adults."
4,worth reading,good stories with good meaning/lessons behind them. not as great or fun as some of the other dr. seuss stories but still worth reading.
5,Sneetches - love it!,I remember reading this story when I was very young. It is especially useful to show to teenagers now to illustrate the silliness of tattoos!
5,The Sneetches by Dr. Seuss,"The Sneetches, written by Dr. Seuss, is an outstanding story. In this story the plain belly Sneetches are left out of all the activities that the Sneetches with stars on their bellies do. All the plain belly Sneetches wanted to do was join in and feel welcome, to have fun, and not be left out in the dark. One day a man came with a machine to add stars to the plain belly Sneetches' bellies. The Sneetches were delighted, but the star belly Sneetches were not. Since the man was a very devious man he had a solution for the Sneetches with stars on their bellies.Dr. Seuss's story of the Sneetches is descriptive, giving the reader a clear image. Even though I am in 7th grade and the reading is easy, there is a profound moral to this story. I would rate it 5 out 5 stars.~ Jenny ~"
5,Fighting Ignorance.,"If you are a racist, umm, I mean Star Belly Sneetch, you should buy and read this book. It will simplify your ignorance to the point where even you might be able to understand the implications of your own racism.If you are not a racist, you should buy this book. It will simplify racists to the point that you will give a hardy chuckle -- and wish that the good old doctor could have lived forever . . . ."
4,Great Recipes...New Orleans Cusine at its best!,Greg Cowman's book is packed full of great recipes. The book has some wonderful New Orlean's style recipes.
4,A pleasant surprise,"Life is strange. I never saw the movie nor the trailer of this movie. I accidentally discovered the music from this soundtrack in the trailer of Saving Private Ryan. After an inquiry of the music & a little help from fellow netizens, I got the CD & is in fact listening to it at this very moment. If you were to see the trailer of SPR, then you would have found the main titles of this CD fits the movie SPR incredibly well. It is very moving but unlike Hymn to the fallen (music from SPR), there's not as much of a ""military"" feel to the music. However this does not in anyway diminish the pleasure of listening to it. The rest of the music on the CD pretty much follows the general theme of the main titles. Personally I also really enjoy track 10 & 11. In conclusion I recommend this soundtrack to anyone who likes Hymn to the fallen."
5,The American President Original Score,This is my all time favorite movie and the music is very easy to listen to. It was delivered quickly and I still enjoy it.
4,Good Chapter Stories,Held the attention of a 5 year old - this is not a early reader book - but is a chapter book that my 5 year old boy enjoyed.
1,Pretty expensive for lack of quality.,"Pretty expensive for the quality of the item. Also, I didn't really trust it on my daughter. It didn't seem all that well made."
3,The Beatles Liverpool,"I fulfilled a dream come true to visit Liverpool last year. After taking a personal 9 hour tour we had seen many of the sites, but not all that we wanted to due to lack of time. When I saw this video was out I was so anxious to see it. I was a bit disappointed. First of all he totally omitted the Casbah which is a big part of the early Beatles history before Ringo Starr. The video seemed a bit homemade and there were times it didn't seem to be focused on what was going on. I am glad I bought it, because it relived some of the spots I just visited, but it could have been done a little more professionally."
3,Like a PBS travel show of Liverpool,"Kind of a low budget travel show through liverpool. Some of the conversations offer good info, but are filmed in a manner that kind of wears you out.I am glad I purchased this those, I wish I could have filmed all these locations myself on my vacation there.Neat to see some of the Beatle Friends that we are used to seeing on the COMPLEAT BEATLES and Beatles Anthology.buy it. it's cheap enough. Good value."
2,At least the CD is good...,"I'll make it quick, I received the CD in a terrible shape. The case was broken and the support inside is too...At least de CD is good..."
2,Bravo! Brav-zzzzzzzzzzzzz.....,"Let me sum up what I have already said in other reviews for this cd. The music on the album is brilliantly creative, it weaves complex tracks together in beautiful and subtle ways. Why the 2 stars? Simple, I use this cd to fall asleep. If you're not sure if you'll like the cd, listen to some sample tracks. Guess what? You've essentially just listened to the entire actual track. Put it on a loop and you don't even need to spend any money! The music is great and all, but it gets very repetitive after the absolutely stunning Seventeen Years. Yes I know I'm exaggerating, but that doesn't change the fact that if I just sit and listen to this album I get bored as hell. Honestly, I can only stay awake for so much enthusiasmless, subtle, and yet still brilliant music."
4,you gave me the buisness on this one baby!,"I didn't know what to expect from this album - but a solid pitchfork review and an album cover that captured my eye made me buy this on an impulse. Normally I steer clear of pop music that doesn't feature vocals, but this is great - it's like rock with a hip hop flavor, and each song evolves from where it begins - the songs don't find a hook and repeat themselves, but go down interesting paths. The second track, el pico, is quite simply terrific - I have never done so much dancing in my car and gotten so many funny looks when parked as when listening to this cd - it's great fun to take a drive with. Also - I normally don't enjoy little skits or spoken parts between songs, but there is a guy who adds the occasional comment on this cd and he fits perfects - he adds a hillarious break from the music between track two and three...check it out! I'm glad I did."
5,WOW!,the best you can get without seeing them live! (i've seen them 3 times so far) melodic and addictive beats. perfect for anything and everything.....
3,Harmonious,"I guess I may have built the hype up for myself with this album, having heard Seventeen Years before this album was released I was expecting something else. In a way I was expecting what the overall product has to offer already, but just a little bit more. The layered harmonies are quite beautiful, and at times a little reminiscent of NES music....and that is wonderful. So definitly check this album out, it has some great moods within."
4,RATATAT RULES!,"I am a huge fan after I saw them in concert opening for interpol. The CD is also great, but agree with the other reviewers that it gets a little repetitive. If you have a chance to see them live you will be overwhelmed!"
4,Good driving music...,"Ratatat: Features guitarist Mike Stroud, who recently provided lead guitar on Ben Kweller's On My Way. Liking OMW I was interested in Ratatat. They are in no way similar, however Ratatat offers something fresh and uplifting to its genre. With no vocals, listeners focus directly on the heavy and sometimes slow-lingering guitar riffs and complex beats. Ratatat is more atmospheric music, it's perfect for background music whether reading, or driving. I'd highly reccommend this album. The only downside are the annoying interludes... you'll know what I mean as soon as you hear it."
5,Killer!,"This is my favorite album of 2004, so far (although I haventheard SUNG TONGS yet...). I've been waiting for it since Idownloaded two Cherry mp3s a couple of years ago, and have keptthem on current rotation ever since. The album doesn'tdisappoint, but it doesn't surprise either. But, myexpectations were very high, so that's not a bad thing. Forthose who havent heard the music yet, its... well, sort of acombination of the more hip-hop inspired melodic side of idmand, um, hair metal. It works amazingly.Download the track 17 YEARS at their site, ratatatmusic. Itstarts of HILARIOUS (and awesome) and ends up soft groovin' andslightly... emotionally introspective? Anyway, the rest of thealbum works variations of the different moods found in theleadoff track, to good effect, and not in a repetitive way.The music is very simple, completely unpretentious, and a whole lot of fun.Great driving music! Especially driving to the beach!Cant wait for the Ratatat Mixtape!"
4,Very Good,some people say that it is too repetitive.. thats not true in my case. i like most songs and each one has their own distinct hook. the only problem i have is staying awake during it cause its soo good it puts me to sleep. i highly recomend buying it if you liked their hit 17years which is available for download on their main site. check it out if u havent. :)
5,Ugly Doll Medium size Good choice,"Ugly Dolls are fun, soft, and spark imagination with their bright colors and unusual abstract shapes. They are made well; very durable. Some children carry them around as a small baby to take care of or a friend to serve tea to, wherever the imagination and creativity play.UglyDoll Abima 12-Inch"
2,Disappointed,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading all Ms. Blackstock's other books, but this series, Second Chances, has left me disappointed. The character development is slow and shallow. It's actually difficult to like the woman who cares more for herself than her child. Wes comes across as wimpy. There is no suspense or action in this book that makes her other novels more enjoyable. I would much rather recomment her Newpoint 911 and Sun Coast Chronicles series."
5,Welcome to a old friend,"Twenty plus years ago I read Clarence's column in M&F. It was so impressing and inspirational I bought this book. Years later I had all that he had written. Then I finally became a vice-president, no time for serious working out, etc. His books went in garage sales and such. Now that I've retired it's time for me again. After a few hundred dollars and many new ideas, I wondered if Clarence Bass books might just be available used or what ever. Amazon has done it again! They're all here, and new, no less. These are the best available, bar none. I've given them a well deserved five star rating. But realize that Clarence, like all writers, except me for now, only has so much gas in his tank. His last couple of works lack the meat of his earlier works, but so what. One of the books I bought directly from him was autographed by Clarence. I'll pass on to you what he said to me ""Get Ripped."""
3,Wasn't what it was supposed to be...,"I have bought these particular chips at Whole Foods. Although I haven't seen them in the store for awhile, I jumped at the chance to purchase them while browsing Amazon.com grocery section. When I received the Terra Golds Onion & Garlic Potato Chips and opened a bag, I was truly disappointed! Although the bags were labled Onion & Garlic, the contents were just plain potato chips with no hint of garlic or onion flavor. I was really anticipating the garlicky and oniony taste of the of the yukon gold chips. I was looking closely at the packaging and noticed that the plain chips were pictured. I remembered from the picture on Amazon.com & from past purchases that the chips had a speckled look to them. I had other people try various bags in the shipment and all were plain chips. I don't know if I would ever purchase these chips online again."
2,I like Old Dutch chips better,"I wanted Old Dutch chips but they were not available,these chips are o.k. but they are too thick."
3,A Yukon THICK Choice.....,"I have enjoyed many Yukon snacks, but these are a bit too thick and oily for my taste. The flavor was good though."
2,Not as tasty as others like PopChips or Kettle,"We keep trying different variety of chips in our office to avoid getting bored and also find better chips. The crew in the office did not like these at all, we have been getting the PopChips and the Kettle chips which tend to disappear pretty fast.Will not order again."
5,Great present for kids,This is a great present for kids and wonderful even for adults; it brings you back in your childhood and make children dreaming to fairy tales that only the Brothers Grimm can tell.
2,Some Sections Incomplete,"Although the blowup diagrams are adequate, many sections were incomplete. All product lines (i.e. engines and body styles) weren't represented in certain years. If you are looking to do a full concourse restoration, make sure your car is fully represented in this book."
3,"Great exploded views - No ""how to""","I was a little disappointed from what I expected. The exploded views were good if not a bit small. I was hoping for some how to's to go along with the views, but nothing like that in this book. Good to have, but not the ""go to"" reference I was looking for."
2,Should be renamed 1964 1/2 to 1970,"This is a great resource if you have a 1970 or older Mustang, but offers very little information for owners of 1973s. Did not find it to be helpful."
3,Maybe not what you would expect.,"Although the book is an informative technical resource with many exploded views drawings of system assemblies and part numbers, it is not exactly a restoration guide. There is not really anything in the book that would step a restorer through the nuts and bolts of working on their mustang. There is some helpful caption information underneath the photos identifying types and options available for the different systems found on the cars."
4,"A good reference manual but not a ""How to"" book.","As long as you realize this book provides all the nitty gritty details of a Mustang, you should be happy with it. You will note many of the diagrams are the same ones used in the parts catalogs like NPD. Since I am in the stage of disassembly and early restoration, it won't get much use yet but once I start to put things back together, I see this book as very valuable. There is not much verbiage so this will not give you the ""tricks"" to put things together but should be a good supplement to other books."
3,Mustang 1964 1/2-1973 Restoration Guide,"Gives you good information about model development, and original and optional equipment and modifications. Good photgraphs. Good description of essential parts by model year. The exploded line drawings give you a general impression of the build and parts, but they are not adequate for do-it-yourself projects. I miss information about function (i.e. ventilation or heater regulation) and about fluids (oil, cooler etc.)"
4,Valuable insights,"Gene Bell-Villada's memoir is a poignant view of a boy growing up in the midst of cultural, linguistic and scholastic confusion. In addition, he convincingly captures his child view as his parents flounder and eventually dissolve the family unit. This frank and instructive tale is a much needed addition to the ""third culture kid"" literature as more people find themselves the offspring of cross-cultural and inter-racial marriages brought up in world venues not connected with either parent and devoid of anchoring safety nets."
1,WOW,"Unless you want to read how and why Gene H Bell Villada thinks he's the best person in the world, I'd save your money."
5,my heroes,"This show is so amazing and inspiring!!! There are way too many bad things happening to animals and humans in the world and to see people dedicate their lives like this, makes me ready to do the same."
1,rip-off,"$56 for one blade, give me a break, these go for about $14 anywhere else. Stay away from plumbersurplus."
2,cheap jewelry,"I did not like this piece. It did not fit my neck and it looked like it would break a moments notice. I returned this back with the another necklace that DID break twice, awaiting my refund. Not ordering from this company again"
1,for 1994 oldsmobile Bravada vortec 4.3L,"did not fit the valve covers, they are too big. was advertised to fit. I cut to size and used RTV sealant, the package said once opened you can not return. so I had to make do."
4,A fine introduction to modifying the Sprite and Midget.,"Mr Stapleton's aim is ambitious, to say the least. To collate the various tuning options available for an extremely popular, 40 year old car, which has been modified from day one, is quite a feat. Stapleton achieves a broad coverage by skimping on some technical nitty-gritty. The simpler mods are covered in full, and the pros and cons of all options are discussed clearly, but this is NOT a 'How-to' book, despite the title.However, as a good, accurate introduction to the art of modifying the Spridget, this book is indispensable. It's full of pictures, and will certainly bring the novice Spridget owner a good understanding of the ins and outs of performance modification. I highly recommend it. G"
4,This product did the job for a decent price,This are probably not the best quality available but for a costume they are super and the price was good compared to local costume shops. They were very dirty by the end of the evening but I hand washed them and they cleaned up fairly well.
2,Overpriced,"It came in a really well packaged box, complete with sealed air to protect a flimsy pair of cotton gloves. Don't be fooled by the ""professional"" photograph on top. I thought they were high quality gloves but in reality, you can tell at first glance that it is a mass produced 20 cents a pair glove. I wore it for 5 minutes and the frills were coming lose already. Also, the tips of the glove are poorly designed, even if it fits my hand, there is a lot of excess, giving it a crumpled look. Maybe it's okay for parade, but definitely not gloves you want to be doing magic in. Oh. I found this glove going for 2 dollars after I bought it from Amazon for 7. Felt bad man."
3,Gloves thin--snap hard to fasten,"Not nearly as thick and nice as the antique, yellowing military parade gloves I am replacing, and the snap is a pain--not easy to fasten because the snap is in an awkward position away from the edge of the glove."
2,Started good then changed course,"I liked the beginning of this books because I enjoy stories about police but...the details of the horse killing were repeated FAR too often. I still kept reading until about a third of the way in, we got dropped into a horse drama! WAY too much description! What everyone wore, what their horses looked like, blah, blah, blah...I have no idea if they found both killers or not. I gave up."
1,LD runner,"I would not have purchased this book if I had been able to preview it at our library. It is more of a pamphlet than a book. If Precor included it with the purchase of it's treadmills OK, but don't pay for it."
2,Treadmill Training and Workout Guide,"If the book was titled ""Treadmill Training and Workout Guide for Marathon Runners,"" it would have been more telling. The first 42 pages involve stretching exercises and is then followed by treadmill workouts for people who are training for marathons.If this is your goal then the book may be worth it. If your goal is general walking for health and exercise then there are better books out there."
2,Runners beware!,"Okay, I'm sure this book meant well. But I think it's a little simplistic and repetitive. Nothing in it that I haven't thought of on my own. In fact, not even as much as I have thought of on my own. I think you'd get just as good tips going to runners pages or chat rooms. I think this was a way for the author to make a few bucks."
3,Precor Presents Alberto Salazar Treadmill Training & Workout,"I've been running for about 18 years and always wondered if I was doing it properly or getting the most out of it. I could never find a book, other than training for a marathon, to help me. Salazar's training book was very motivational. I knew I fell into the ""runners"" category; I've incorporated it into my life so that I don't even have to think about working out. It's just a part of my routine every other day. It was interesting to read about the stages a runner goes through, i.e. from beginner, to jogger, to competitor, to athlete and then finally runner. I'm incorporating his stretching exercises and now realize their importance in warding off injury. Also reassuring was the issue about weight and what the scale says. Time to ignore the number! A very helpful book."
2,Not as expected,I wish I had taken a previous reviewer to heart before I purchased this book. I found Alberto's Salazar's book was very weak regarding using a treadmill for exercising. Casey Meyers book on walking was much more useful.
2,Ugh! Too bad...,"I was very excited to get this book in hopes it contained new insights (so little has been written in depth) into one of the great electronic bands of our times but unfortunantly he really doesn't have any. Problem for me was Paul uses WAY to many quotes from Julian Cope's hyperactive book on Kraut rock- I already have that book and think it's pretty ridiculous itsself. When Paul steps out and writes his own opinion the book starts to have meat. But it lacks real depth and insight. Too much is skimmed over and he has an annoying style of writing two versions of every chapter, one skimmed one so-so. The British writer Miles wrote an excellent book on Pink Floyd and he also wrote the program notes for the Stratosfear tour book. It's REALLY too bad he never wrote a book about T.D. But bottom line this is it for now. The book does make you want to check out some of their more lame recordings- but tread carefully overall."
3,It'll do for now,"I bought this book because there are no others on the subject! It is dauntingly slim for a band 33 years old and deals fleetingly with certain areas of the band's history. That said it did answer many questions and was well enough written. It also whetted my appetite for more music. I would have liked to see a larger volume that could have taken time to go further in depth on this band's history, but for the price I am not complaining."
4,Franke & Froese,"I still find it difficult to understand how these two blokes supposedly weren't close buddies? I was pretty astonished when I first read about this in Paul's great little book.So does that mean those times when I queued up in the cold to see my heroes after a gig and watched them sign their autographs in amazement,that all was not rosey in TD's garden? And how did Franke & Froese exchange their musical ideas so well if this was so.Great book!"
2,Not A Book For Tangerine Dream Fans,"The author does an admirable job via trying to encapsulate Tangerine Dream's enormous musical discography. However, he only has a few accolades for Edgar Froese, the inimitable and indomitable leader of the Band. The author knows nothing about the Froese family. For example, Edgar, Monika and Jerome Froese are all vegetarians, wildlife and nature lovers and interested in saving the planet. I am especially disappointed that the author does not consistently commend Edgar Froese's incredible talents and ability to create great music after losing so many incredibly gifted bandmates. Sure, Tangerine Dream has had a few below average albums but none of them are as bad as this author states they are. It is high-time for a captivating and comprehensive book about Edgar Froese and Tangerine Dream. They are the music industry's seminal and pioneering electronic icons !"
5,Fun!,"It is fun and a converstion starter. Not that you expect much in sound quality, it was a bit high pitched. it's meant as a novelty and not a serious musical instrument!"
3,Does not fit standard home vacuum and it is not rectangular as depicted in photo,"This item is for a 1 1/2"" vacuum hose as described and not the standard home vacuum hose size of 1 1/4"" It is not rectangular as depicted in photo but round and very large and would probably only work on a powerful shop vacuum."
3,OK for the shop,"This brush does not look anything like the picture. You would think after a year Amazon could get it right, be warned. It is a large diameter round shape and has a thin row of stiff bristles.It fits my DeWalt D27905 shop vac hose perfectly. Since DeWalt doesn't include any brushes with their vacuums, this could be what you are looking for."
3,more please!,"Larry Eifert assumes that only Portlanders and Seattleites will be reading his book. This book only mentions the old growth forests closest to Seattle. It fails to mention any old growth locations North of Mt. Rainier. If you live in Bellingham you would find this book close to useless. Although Washington has more old growth locations, he seems to cover the old growth sites in Oregon with more depth. Keep searching, you'll find a better book."
5,Brings the magic alive,"This slim volume is fascinating, easy to read and beautifully illustrated. While it is not a thorough scientific treaty on the subject and doesn't provide information on the locations of ALL old growth (something I kind of expected from the title) it is nevertheless an exquisite introduction.Having contacted Larry Eifert about the book I have to also say that he and wife Nancy are extremely friendly and helpful, not only pointing me in the direction of other information and advising on the best places to visit but also sending me further of his works gratis! In particular, a wonderful little chart describing the creatures and plants of the Redwoods which was the perfect suppliment to the Field Guide."
5,Awesome!,The novel was great! I could not put the book down. This was the first time I had read one of Ms Francine Mathews Novels. I would recommend this romance novel to anyone. It was such a good novel that I plan on buying other novels by Ms Francine Matthews.
3,Doesn't countersink pins,"Just returned mine and ordered a Grex 635 instead. I fired about 40 pins in hard and soft wood, tried various compressor pressure settings, and various settings of the so-called ""depth control."" The gun jammed once. If the air pressure is at the low end of the recommended range (70-100 lbs.), or if the so-called ""depth control"" is set low, pins will usually be proud of the surface. With the proper adjustments the best you can do is get them to be flush, which is unacceptable as far as I'm concerned. According to Bostitch Customer Service, this pin nailer is not designed to countersink pins, but rather to leave them flush with the service. The ""depth control"" is a misleading name for what is really just another way of adjusting air pressure. It does NOT change the travel distance of the pin."
4,An excellent pin nailer with one small flaw!,"I just received this nailer about a week ago and have put it to work everyday. The first time I used it I noticed it would only drive the pins flush which makes the tool useless. The pins wouldn't even countersink in pine. I decided to grind the tip down a little hoping that it would allow the driver to make the pin go well below the wood. I'm sure Stanley wouldn't recommend this, but it did the job and now my pins go just the right depth in any wood that I use it on. Besides this minor problem everything else is perfect with tool including the case."
