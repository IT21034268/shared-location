2,Very Disappointed,"I was expecting more protection from the elements of nature than what I got. I clean my car perfectly. Then, if it should happen to rain the cover leaves a print on my windows. The inside lining comes off on my rag top car roof. Finally, if your car antenna isn't removable like mine then you might be in trouble. You have to put a hole through the car cover itself for the antenna. There are directions on how to do it but who wants to bother. Would not suggest to anyone to purchase."
5,The Best Projection TV I Have Seen And Heard!,"For a while, I was hesitant in owning a projection TV. The reason was, the pictures were not clear, crisp and sharp. This one has proven to be the exception! It is from the first time I saw it in a store.It has a clear, crisp, sharp hi-fi dbx stereo sound to match. It has several convenient features I use, including its P.I.P. I can not get all the local channels on satellite. So, having a separate antenna connected, I can watch the local programs and satellite simultaneously. And I can swap on the remote between which is on the main picture and which is in one of the corners.It has a lot of convenient, easy-to-use features, as well as enough connections. It is one rear projection TV I highly recommend to everyone!"
2,Lower quality than imagined,"My wife is Asian and we spotted this online. We enjoyed many meals in restaurants over in Asia using these at the table. Unfortunately, in comparison, this item is truly low, low quality. Very thin metal... So thin we kinda worry it will melt or suffer some once heat is applied .To be fair, we have yet to use this item, but simply from a 'feel' standpoint we feel this is definitely NOT worth the money. Better to go to a specialty shop to see and 'feel' the utility before you buy."
2,Way Too Much To Think About Sometimes....,"A very inventive concept of New York's ""culture of congestion"" and how people are affected by the architecture they create. It is heavily researched and exhaustive, and after pretty much the third page I agreed with his concept of NY being ""totally fabricated by man"". What could of been a fascinating article becomes a spastic, heavy-handed read with a sledgehammer effect to your brain. (However,for those of us reading it for school, there are plenty of pictures that fill up the almost devastatingly vast 300+pages quickly.) It will scramble your brain with its thousands of nearly bumper-stickerish statements (""It hides life."" ""The Mountain MUST become architecture."") written with pretentious glee. However, I believe an independent scientific study has concluded that when pretending to read this book on the train people around you will assume your IQ is 40% higher than truth."
4,Delirous New York,I sent this to a friend in the Netherlands and have not heard from her so a review is out of the question.
2,Not For Me!,This book was a total disappointment to me. I thought there would be more creative projects and certainly more helpful knitting information. I wound up giving it to charity so all was not lost.
5,Ulterior motives,"Yep this is a great book to show how to turn those leftover odds and ends into something beautiful and perhaps useful. As with most knitting book the ideas may only be revolutionary to those newly inducted in to the craft. However the idea is to consolidate the theme of ""oddball knitting"" into one volume. It is not as much patterns as tactical approaches.Personaly I found this book more useful for projects using expensive materials such as Qiviut (which comes from the Artic musk ox,) is a tad expensive for sweater projects. On page 96there is an ideal scarf pattern for this material.In the back of the book you will find a project index and a yarn index."
4,Interesting Ideas,"I bought this book for my daughter, so I have not done any of the knitting projects. She was quite pleased with the gift, and from what I could see, the projects looked very interesting."
2,Waste of Time!,"I'm SO glad I got this book from the library instead of buying it. It was worth the 75c hold fee, but not much more. I was expecting ""stuff you can make with whatever small amounts of yarn you have in your stash"", but got ""stuff you can make with a few skeins of expensive luxury yarns"". There are VERY few projects in here I'd ever consider making. If I should decide I want to make one, I'll check the book out again, but I won't be buying this for myself or anyone else, ever."
1,Nothing creative about it,"I was really anxious to see this book, because I have a lot of leftovers I'd love to use up. Sadly, the book was a huge disappointment. I didn't think the patterns were creative, nor useful, and many are just downright ugly. Nothing enticing about them at all."
2,Disappointed,I fist saw the book offered in a knitting catalog in November of 2005 and was eager to purchase the book and put to use some of my lonely skeins of yarn. They nor several other companies that offered the book were able to get it from the publisher. I kept calling these places on a weekly basis and one company even called me and told me they were giving up on the book. In July of 2006 I discovered it on Amazon and placed an order and it arrived in no time. After skimming through the book I was disappointed that I put so much time and effort into trying to obtain the book. I was inot impressed with the patterns offered in the book. The patterns in the book one can find in most other knit books.
3,Cute,Cute! My kids we're tickled- purchased a few years ago late at getting review in! Memory recalls you had to pet the toy quite a bit to get him started with his mechanics. Cat was not appreciative of barking toy.
3,Kind of Dissapointing,"The main reason I bought this CD was because I ABSOLUTLEY love the band Evanescence and the song ""Breath No More"" But this verison just was not the best, her voice was to overpowering on some parts (like where you had to turn the volume down because it was so loud. I recommened that you buy the ""Anywhere But Home"" CD that came out a few months ago that ""Breath No More"" version is awsome). I do like some of the other songs such as ""Never There (She Stabs)"", ""Photograph"", and ""In the Light"" but overall like the one guy said a few letters below mine it just was not as good as the Daredevil CD, Kind of Disapointing."
3,Dreaming,I bought this CD soley because The Dreaming was on it. I already own two versions of the E.P that you can get on their website http://www.thedreamingonline.com/ But Serioulsy The Dreaming is an awsome up and coming band. Fronted By Christopher Hall (formilay of Stabbing Westward) and Johnny Haro (of Econoline Crush and former Stabbing Westward Drummer). Think Wither+Blister+Burn+Peel Kicked up a notched.While the rest of the music on this CD i felt was so/so The market is flooded with similar stuff right now.
2,Opposite of Daredevil,"While Daredevil's soundtrack was WAY better than the movie, Elektra is WAY better than its soundtrack. There are about five good songs on here, and it is not what you'd expect from a comic book movie soundtrack. The Evanescence song is great, and so is most of the second half of the soundtrack. Many of the songs fall flat, though."
2,"Nu-Metal rubbish, for the most part...","...however, the previously unreleased Taking Back Sunday song 'Your Own Disaster' is more than worth checking out, along with the highlight of this compilation - 'Beautiful' by The Dreaming, fronted by Christopher Hall (formerly of industrial band Stabbing Westward). Buy their 4-track EP from their website @ http://www.thedreamingonline.com - it's more than worth the money, unlike this Wind-Up records drivel. Sorry."
5,"""Elektra: The Album"" is excellent!","""Elektra: The Album"" is excellent! It is just as excellent as ""Daredevil: The Album"".1. Strata - Never There (She Stabs)2. Jet - Hey Kids3. The Donnas - Everyone Is Wrong4. Switchfoot - Sooner Or Later5. Finger Eleven - Thousand Mile Wish (Elektra Mix)6. Megan McCauley - Wonder7. Taking Back Sunday - Your Own Disaster8. Evanescence - Breathe No More9. 12 Stones - Photograph10. Alter Bridge - Save Me11. The Dreaming - Beautiful12. Submersed - Hollow13. Hawthorne Heights - Angels With Even Filthier Souls14. The Twenty Twos - 5 Years15. Full Blown Rose - In The Light"
4,Better than I expected it to be,"This soundtrack was a lot better than I expected it to be. I originally bought this soundtrack to hear the new Full Blown Rose song ""In The Light"", and was not disappointed! This band will be the next big thing. Other songs that stood out to me were Strata ""Never There"" , 12 Stones ""Photograph"", The Twenty Twos ""5 Years"" to name a few. This soundtrack may be seen by some as mellow, but I found it to be quite emotional, and inspiring. I put it into my CD player, listened to it in the dark, was filled with a whirlpool of emotions. People sometimes buy soundtracks with extremely high expectations, and always walk away disappointed. There are some powerful songs on this CD, which I think make this soundtrack worth buying. By all means, this is not a CD pumped up with death metal and nu-metal songs. I think this soundtrack offered something new to the way movies are seen...and the way soundtracks are made."
4,Great songs...if you go for that style,"Personally, I love a good number of songs from this album, including ""Wonder"" by Megan McCauley, which is playing a lot overseas, ""Photograph"" by 12 stones and ""Breathe no More"" by Evasnescence. I enjoyed the album throughout, but the thing this soundtrack lacks is diversity. It's a great buy, if you love that style of songs (if you're an Evanescence fan, go for it). Influences of Creed-derived bands throughout.Definetly worth the price."
3,As Expected-A Little Dissapointing,"I bought the soundtrack simply for The Dreaming's song ""Beautiful"". The Dreaming were perfect as usual. That song was awesome and the best one on the cd. The other tracks were average if that. Other ones I liked were Strata-Never There, Switchfoot-Sooner or Later, Evanescence-Breathe No More, 12 Stones-Photograph, Submersed-Hollow."
3,"Nice, but not really necessary","Like its companion sugar bowl, this is a very pleasant design. However, my guests prefer to get their coffee milk or cream directly from the container. I guess we're too uncivilized to appreciate nice things."
4,"Great, but not the best!","I go back and forth with this and clinique's. I like it, but it does leave a slightly greasy feel if you apply too much. Overall great protection, just doesn't moisturize quite enough for my dry spots around my t-zone."
1,Burn sans sun!,"Stay away from this product! I use retin-a and have an oily T-zone. I have used several over the counter products but never reacted to any like I did to this product.I switched to using the SPF 60 since I use retin-a, and my skin immediately felt sunburnt - my eyes watered, my skin hurt, was tight, blotched and flaky. Large angry red blotches appeared on my neck area where I used the sunscreen. I initially thought it was the retin-a or a new mositurizer I was using. But I used both these over the weekend and stayed home with no sunscreen - no reaction - nada! My skin felt smooth and soft. Come Monday morning I put on the sunscreen and the burning started. Within an hour my skin looked horrendous. The last time around my skin took a week to recover, but now I have identified the culprit. This product goes right into the bin. Wish I had read the reviews first. My skin still burns every time I so much as touch it."
1,If you like shiny skin . . .,"Neutrogena ""Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch"" (SPF 50, 70, 85, 100) is okay if you like lots of shine and a greasy feel, which I do not. Also, if you apply it anywhere within an inch of your eyes, you'll soon have the excitement of watering, burning eyes -- quite a distraction if you happen to be driving. I cannot recommend this product to anyone who wants a matte finish and eye comfort."
1,Product burns.,"I hate traditional sunscreen that tends to be oily and heavy. I liked the idea of sheer light feel of Neutrogena. So I tried both Neutrogena Ultra Sheer SPF 30 and 45. As soon as I applied the product, I felt a strong burning sensation throughout my entire face. Not some tingly sensation that is associated with some products. It felt like my face was on fire. I immediately washed it off. It still hurt. I had to cool it with cold water to numb the pain. Next day, my face was pink throughout and my skin still hurt. I have tried variety of products, Cetaphil, Purpose, Alba, Lancome, Estee Lauder, Clarines, Chanel, Clinique, and many over the counter products typically found in any drug store. I have never had such reaction. Note, I don't have a sensative skin. My skin tends to be normal with a little shine to T zone. My mom, who has dry skin, tried the products. She also complained that it hurt to use either SPF 30 or 45. I had to throw them away. Don't waste your money."
1,Too much wrong with it - use Melissa & Doug instead,"Great idea but not well made. The paint cup inserts are very hard to put on. The brushes are barely long enough to reach the bottom of the cups, requiring you to pour way more paint in then needed. No lid to store the pots with the paint in afterwards, making for lots of wasted paint. Have tried Melissa & Doug's version since - love it!"
4,Great Expansion of Myss's Archetypes,"I really enjoyed the Secret Language of Archetypes. Caroline Myss is one of my favorite writers/speakers, and this CD series was as engrossing as her other audio releases. The reason I gave it four stars rather than five was because of the amount of repetition from her Sacred Contact book, audio, and audio workshop. But a certain anmount of repetition is to be expected, and there is enough original information that I still highly recommend it."
3,Tight Oakland SH*T,This cd is tight! However some of the beats are wack but the flows they spit are smooth and hard! I would recommend this cd A+.
4,A well written account of America's rural past.,"This book is a well written account of the Critchfield's family life in the Dakotas, from the late 1800's until the 1980s. Fascinating to understand how farm life has changed as America moved from a rural to an urban culture."
5,Fantastic!,"I was given this DVD player as a gift, and I love it. I have never had a problem with it freezing, and I use it often. And I have not had any trouble with Disney movies in the slightest. I am actually buying this machine for my parents for Christmas."
1,The worst DVD Player,This is the worst DVD player in the world. It will not play a DVD without skipping and freezing. I feel that I was taken for ride by the company.
1,save yourself a lot of time and aggrevation!,"horrible product! I have been through 2 in 3 months. Philips customer service is terrible, and they do not abide to their warranty. I had to buy another unit by another company since Philips held mine for 2 months.Apex...inexpensive($) no problems."
1,Philips=Bad Products+Bad Customer Ser vice,"I bought a Philips DVD 621 player less than a year ago and it has stopped working. Like most people who buy electronic products I expected it to last longer than a year, but apparently Philips doesn't believe in their products past 90 days. This is why I recommend that you stay FAR AWAY from Philips products. Don't buy their stuff because there is a good chance it will quit on you and you're not going to be happy with what they tell you when you finally get through to them in their customer service."
1,DVD621 has internal problems according to Philips!,"I received this about 2 weeks ago and have had nothing but problems. It freezes on movies then will go blank and say insert playable disk. It does this on every single DVD put in the machine. I called philips about the problem and was told by them that this is an internal manufacturing problem with this particular model. ALL of them are like this. I waited 4 weeks after I ordered this to receive it. Now I have to wait for the RMA letter from Philips, ship it back at MY cost, then they will ship me a replacement. If you are in the market for a DVD player, stay away from this one."
4,No problems here...,"I recently purchased this DVD player on sale at a major retail outlet. For the price I paid, I am more than satisfied with the performance. If you are looking for a basic DVD player, look into this one. Since I already have a receiver with built in Dolby Digital and DTS, I didn't want a player that had all the same decoders (why waste the money?). Picture quality is great. The remote is easy to use. I am pleased so far.Note: I read the reviews above shortly after purchasing the player and got worried. So I immediately put the player to the test. After watching two movies consecutively (in the same sitting), the player was still running flawlessly. Not sure what the glitch was on the two above, but perhaps I have a later model that has been corrected. We'll see."
5,Still going strong...,"I've had this player for over a year now and still no problems. Someone else mentioned that the discs are slow to load and this is true, but it's a small price to pay for the deal I got. I've watched hundreds of DVDs. The only ones that give me trouble are the ones I rent (especially the ones that look like the renters used it as a frisbee). How do discs get in that condition? Anyway, no problems, no flaws, just great picture and sound for a small price.To the guy with the modulating between light and dark...that's the copyright protection kicking in. If you hook up the DVD player through a VCR, that's what happens. I did that first because I have an older TV with only the RF input. Turns out I needed and RF modulator...and the problem was fixed. Check it out."
1,the tease,This player is exceedingly slow to load and has the remarkable ability to freeze (lock up like a windows pc) in the middle of the most dramatic scences of any DVD. I think it was designed expressly for the sqeamish to watch horror movies. It senses your anxitey level and freezes before you become to scared. If you feel your blood pressure can stand to watch the whole movie without pausing then buy another player.
4,What more could ask for?,I got this player and then read all the bad things the reviews had to say about it. I'm glad that I did it in that order. I have had no problems with it.The picture looks great on our big screen and the sound is also very good. It has been a great value for the money. The loading is a little slow but what do you expect for this kind of money. If I had read the reviews first I would have missed out on a great deal!
2,DVD as gift,"Player is not recommended. It does not play the new DVD's well at all. DVD player cleanly for 40-45 min. then will start to freeze picture and sound or just picture while sound continues. The movie will play like this until the end or it may just kick you out of your movie. Older DVD's play just fine. But, I like the newer DVD's with my surround sound. I'm kicking this one to the curb. You get what you pay for!"
3,PHILIPS DVD621AT,"I regularly rent DVD's from Netflix.Com, watch 3-5 movies per week.They work just fine in this player,old or new releases included!CON: the picture seems to modulate between dark and light continually, is this common?it might be my tv/vcr system or this unit, I am not sure which is the culprit...The player has only rejected one movie, I sent that back to Netflix.Com, they immeadiatley replaced it, the replaced copy worked fine...I believe that Philips DVD621AT was upgraded before I purchased mine, it has given me no problem[note CON above]. The earlier editions must be really awful, glad I got the upgraded model."
2,I wouldn't buy it again,"In my experience, it's a okay player for the price (purchased a year and a half ago). No complaints about the design of the remote, and the player has has some cool features (like zoom). My biggest gripe is really just a nuisance: it takes forever to load. Occasionally, however, it will freeze completely, and none of the controls on the machine or the remote will work, including power, eject, etc. I have to unplug it and then plug it in again. That's why I've given it two stars instead of three. If I were to go back in time, I wouldn't buy it again. I spend a little more and get something better. On the other hand, if you don't mind a long wait for your DVD to load or having to unplug it to reset it sometimes--it's never happened to me *during* a movie--it might be [economical]enough to consider if price is the most important factor."
1,Not worth buying.,"I purchased this player about 3 months ago. It's been nothing buttrouble since. Movies freeze and then the player boots you out ofthe movie. Discs get stuck in the player and every command from the remote takes time to complete it's intended function. At first player worked good but progressively got worse to the pointthat any dvd is useless. Also the player wont play disney discs with out inputing certin commands. I would have thought better of a product from philips. This player is a real disappointment. My advice, dont purchase this product."
4,Philips621AT DVD player,Good deal. I had no problems with this DVD player. All the DVD's played great. Only thing I find to be a mild inconvience is that it loads the movie a little slow in the beginning. Otherwise no trouble.
1,(...),"If you even paid $1.00 for this out of the bargin box at a Garage sale, your being ripped off. It Takes FOREVER to load and play DVD's and follow commands. freezes in the middle of Movies, and doesn't play CD-Rs. (...) Never again will I buy a Philips brand anything I was so dissatisfied."
5,THE REAL DEAL,"As I received and assembled this table I was continually more and more impressed. It is a heavy, solid functional piece of kitchen furniture. With its use of hexhead cap bolts screwing in to embedded metal sleeves and cam lock screws it bolts together in a very durable, substantial way that ought to last for a long time. Assembly took a couple of hours. The instructions are clear for an adept home craftsman, though novices might need help. The finished product is solid as a rock and quite handsome. It's a lot of product for the money!"
1,Not Very Helpful,"This book was actually very useless. I was excited when I ordered it but very disappointed when it arrived as all it contains is pictures and estimates. There is no information on the pin backs such as where it originated, the maker, or event all you get from this book is a picture of the button, an estimated value, color code and a 10 year span of when the button might have been produced. And the book is very outdated, save your money."
3,Downhill we go,"Twiztid does an amazing job at creating album intros and it's a shame they cannot maintain that creativness throughout the their entire CD. Since this was Twiztid's second album and I was rather excited seeing how impressed I was with Mostasteless I couldn't wait to hear it. Upon listening I will admit, I thought the beats were great but it was just some of the songs had once again struck me as being cheaply and quickly thrown together. As I mentioned in one of my other Twiztid reviews one can usually sense this kind of phenomenon, It's that feeling one gets when you know that the musician could have done a much better job but just didn't give it his or her all. Perhaps I'm not a Juggalo and I don't have the so-called Dark Carnival spirit flowing through my blood but as far as I'm concerned this CD could have been better."
5,Hit me,"Fisrt of all let me tell for all you hip hoppers out there this is not for you. This is not rap just for starters because for the most part rap is for loser who can't play anything and have to look really dumb. Oh look at me I have a chain the goes all the way to my a## and some dumb looking sean john crap playing lil jon dissing some other F$%$er. Come on can't see how dumb this sounds well that how you come off to me. Now if you wanna talk about real rap then go get 2 pac, etc anyone before 2 pac is ok. Now on to the real music. This is the first cd I got of twiztid see I have been down with clown for 9 years and will be tell I am dead in the ground. Twizitd is the s#$t!!!!! So if you don't like the mainstream, and are into death, smoking, and other stuff then this is for you so get it or move on."
2,"Disappointing, to say the least","I bought this the day it came out, along with the 2 ICP discs. Although it's not as weak as those 2, it is still a huge step down from Mostasteless. I was hoping it would grow on me, but it hasn't. Twiztid have all but abandoned the more traditional hip-hop sound and are trying to be ICP Jr. It's too bad, because they really are talented MCs. But the vast majority of the songs on this album are sub-standard rap metal drivel. The Doors cover is particularly painful. The song with 3 Six Mafia is pretty good, and Maniac Killa has it's moments (Blaze's verse is pretty dope). But on the whole, this album is hugely disappointing."
3,"Okay, I guess","This album has some pretty good songs, like We Don't Die and Different. But some songs, it's like, they would never end! But if you like Twiztid, I recommend Green Book, or Man's Myth."
2,twiztid freek show,"well this album was certainly not as good as mostasteless. i mean like the only good song on this cd was ""We Don't Die"" it seems that their style has changed and i do not like this album. go get MOSTASTELESS! it is waay better!"
1,Horrible,Shytty lyrics followed by half decent beats and horrid vocal work = Freek Show. The only song that slightly interested me while listening to this trash was People Are Strange which is a DOORS cover. Wanna waste your money on immature lyrics.. Purchase this cd.. if not then go look else where..Freek Show.. Hardly.. More like annoying..
1,HA HA HA~!!!!,"You got to be kidding right ~!?? If you are an Intelligent Human Being, use common sense please ~! LOL You can not loose ONE body part by wearing this kind of gadget! LOL ~!!! You got to loose entire body fat mass by cardio work out, plus eat good. PERIOD. Gee, I could come up with TONS of silly Gadget like this to become a millionaire for silly consumers !! can not believe people actually spend a penny on these things ~! LMAO~!!! People are cute~!!"
2,The Backbone Of Driver - The Chases - Is G.O.N.E!!!!!,The thrill of the chase is gone....Now youre just driving from A to B just for the hell of it...So dont waste your money buying... just rent!Quite clearly Reflections are dellusionally disoriented...They sacrifice the very thing that uphold the fans interests..- the ALMIGHTY chases...the chases??!?! thats unforgiveable- powerslidding round bends- the movie director- did i say the very flavor of driver - the chases - is gone?!- the speedy chases - the speedAnd decided to do a GTA clone!!!They sold their souls to the devil.... for moneyI hope they blooooody see this review in uk to see how they phukked! up really badly and let the fans down!!!there were better designed chases in driv3r but still not enougha star for the 70s tunes and a star for upgradeable cars
2,"Not so Pure, more like murky","Not bad but with only a smattering of hits to say the least, I was expecting that most of the songs I did'nt know were soon to be hits, but the were has beens that were out of date.Two thumbs down."
1,She not singing on this one,"I mistakenly thought that Sarah would be singing on this cd, but instead it's a compilation of what songs she likes from other singers."
3,don't be fooled!,"This is a nice collection of songs, but somehow I was thinking when I bought it that Sarah would be doing covers and singing these songs herself. This is not the case. Enjoyable nonetheless, but I might not have bought it otherwise."
5,Great light reading!,"Nancy Drew is great light reading for anyone looking to unwind. I am constantly amazed at how old these books are (the first one written in 1930), yet they really don't seem overly dated. I would remind the reviewers who complain about diversity and such stuff to remember when these books were originally written. Great stuff!"
5,Nancy Drew is the best!,"I myself read the starter set for Nancy Drew and I found it very exciting and good. It kept me reading and reading. I could not stop! Nancy Drew books are interesting and make you wonder what is going to happen next. When I first read my very 1st Nancy Drew book, I thought it was boring. Until I started to get really into the book. Now I am on the 9th book. Well, going to read the 9th book. I would recommend this to all children 10-12 years old. It is a excellent book and a great book that will make you keep on reading. Until you read them all!"
4,Reading expands your mind,"In this day of forced electronic toys, the ability to dream and imagine must be taught by reading. That is why I purchased the Nancy Drew series for my Grandaughter's Christmas present.Nancy Drew Starter Set (Nancy Drew)I highly recommend that parents do the same.George C. Sapp (professional Santa)"
5,Nancy Drew Best Buy!,"The Starter Set is a great way to hook new readers on the adventures of everyone's favorite girl sleuth, Nancy Drew.Contained herein are the first six mysteries in the series which are among the best in the canon.There is plenty of adventure and mystery in these stories as you follow along with Nancy and her best friends, Bess and George...."
3,Nancy Drew Starter Set,"Overall I was satisfied. The seller indicated this item was in new condition. While the books were the packaging was torn in several places. I would purchase from the seller again, knowing my version of new and theirs is different."
5,Loving Nancy,"I bought these for my eight-year-old daughter, who is quite the bookworm, when I remembered how much I loved them. It is hard to find appropriate reading for an 8 year old advanced reader and Nancy Drew fit the order! My daughter, even though an advanced reader, is still an eight year old and I don't want her exposed to the teenage content of the other books. Nancy Drew is still mature and a good girl for my mature and good girl!"
5,childrens book,"This came in good shape and my grand children enjoyed them very much. They came new, never used"
5,75th anniversary nancy drews,"If you are sick and tired of other people acting like the thought police then you'll want to have a set like this before they go into the memory hole. The frank character descriptions are the best and this more real-life Nancy doesn't hesitate to defend herself, either. Forget the corny, whiney bleat from the usual minority who get their noses out of joint at the bad guys being described the way they really are. I'm no fool and neither is my little girl so I am delighted to get her this particular set of books which tells it like it is. Those of you who home school will know what I mean. Wishing the publishers would reproduce the entire original texts. Enjoy!"
5,Wonderful books and Wonderful Price,"Great starter set for any young girl, to start her on her way to sleuthing with Nancy Drew. Also a great rememberance for all the women out there who have read these books before and would like to again. Can't get a better price for the set."
4,Back in Time,When I was a child I use to read these books and enjoyed them very much. I went on every adventure with Nancy. My great niece loves to read and she is just the right age to enjoy reading these books. I hope she enjoys them as much as I did in my pre-teen years.
2,"Not as stated, returned for a refund!","Was not a boxed set at all, but 6 used books in varying degrees of ""used"" shrinkwrapped together with a label that said ""boxed set"" no box. I returned them."
2,Does not stand the test of time,"I was surprised at how bad the writing in these books was. The first book in particular was extremely poorly-written and would not be published today. I'm sure it was groundbreaking at the time, but there are honestly far better choices for children's books these days."
2,Damaged Goods,Item arrived in terrible condition. It was broken in at least two places and I never even opened the second box. I guess I should have heeded the warnings in the other reviews. Now I have to lug both 80-plus pound boxes to the post office and return them. Too bad.
4,Love it,I love the armoire. It looks great with all furniture. The only complaint I have is the staples on the underneath side of the bottom. They are hard to remove and ruin the underneath surface (it doesn't show though). I had bent hinges on one of the top doors but they bend right back with no problem. Great buy!
1,4 Star piece with a 1 Star experience,"I agree with Dundee, MI. I ordered this piece and the cornice, two of the doors and a shelf were damaged. Not sure if it was due to shipping, poor packaging, or poor handling within the warehouse. I have contacted the manufacturer/distributor 3x with no response. Still waiting for the replacement parts. Due to the complicated packaging, I have no desire to send it back. But, I will I if I have to. I think Target needs to create a liason for we the customer and the furniture source. I believe this entertainment center could be a 4 star piece but, a an initial 1 star experience. Frustration is the bottom line."
1,Poor Packaging,I have ordered two entertainment centers now from Target.com -- this being the second one. The first had to be sent back because it was excessively damaged during shipping. The second (this one) was the same way. I ordered replacement parts over a week ago - now when I say replacement parts - I am talking the top piece and all of the doors. These could be really nice pieces if they took the time to package them correctly to ship. So the workmanship is not the greatest but you can't find the coffee finish anywhere else - so guess you have to deal with the poor packaging and hope replacement parts come.
2,Don't do it,"I was absolutely in love with this piece on line, so much that after reading the bad reviews I decided to chance it. The doors don't match up when shut and it arrived damaged at the top corner, really damaged. The last thing that I unwrapped was the top to find it damaged, and after spending 4 hours putting the thing together I wasn't about to take it apart to send it back. If you decide to buy this, please examine all pieces before putting together so you don't get stuck with it! Not worth the price."
1,lacking stability,"A sinch to put together by myself in an hour... directions made it a breeze. No problems as far as that goes. But it completely lacks in stability, cam locks are a sham. That in it's self should have been the first warning. Had to go to Lowes to buy wood to cover the complete back and tack down with nails. The cardboard they come with doesn't cut it. With all said and done, looks great, but it's hassle wasn't worth the money."
2,A wobbly piece of crap!,"It takes @ 3-4 hours to put together b/c the holes and screws do not match up. Once you finally get it together, if you have to move it - you are screwed! Because it comes apart, again. As long as you do not move it, or breath on it, than you are o.k.! I would recommend if you do buy it and decided to keep it - like we did (because we had already thrown the box away), than you need some wood putty the same color of the armoir and place some new screws in it for better security!"
2,Doors Don't Match Up,"After assembling, the end result is unacceptable. The doors do not line up at all. It is extremely difficult to assemble alone since the top is heavy and the corners were damaged when it arrived."
4,"Hard work, but worth it!","I must agree that I was extremely nervous to order this piece, but loved it so much I decided to chance it. Lucky for me, my order was received with no damage, not even a scratch! The directions could have been easier to follow, but overall not too bad. It was definitely worth it! I got the expensive high-end retailer look without the hefty price-tag!"
3,An errata should come with it or be online,"This book is the first book dealing with cmos memories comprehensively as we can see from its preface.That's it.But,in my opinion,it is also the only book i v read that has the highest error ratings."
2,No recommendation,This book is really unfriendly to the reader.It seems to me that the author is just displaying a lot of knowledge in his brain to the reader.No effort to understand the reader.
3,More of a comedy than a good kung fu movie.,"This movie had me almost coughing up my pizza! However I must warn that it is more along the lines of MST 3000. The fighting-ridiculous, the dubbing- even worse, but trust me this one easily takes the cake in the ""Golden Turkey Award"" category. Definately not a ""Master Killer"" by any means, but well worth the investment for some fun on a rainy day!"
2,Dependable entertainment for the aficionado but nothing to recommend it beyond that devoted audience,"Good kung fu fighting, but repetitive. Ten minutes or so of fun kung fu training. Not as much plot as even the average old school kung fu flick. Dependable entertainment for the aficionado but nothing to recommend it beyond that devoted audience."
4,Fine martial arts!!,"I saw this movie as a kid, and still had memories of the Ghost faced killer. It is nice to see that classy traditional martial arts movies like this are still in the market. Watch out for ""the five elements"" technique from the Ghost faced Killer (Mark Long)."
2,Winning Scholarships for College,"I would definitely NOT recommend this book. The material is very outdated ( copyright 1994, 1999). Some of the websites are not even in use anymore. It is obvious that when this book was written internet use was limited. I was hoping to find scholarship opportunites for my son, instead I found myself out $12.95 (purchase price)."
3,Winning Scholarships,"I thought this book was average. Like many other students I plan to go to college, and some extra cash would be rather helpful! I have a pile of scholarship books, and I thought this book did provide some helpful tips to WINNING scholarships - rather than applying for them. Overall I would recommend this book to anybody looking for scholoarships - but I advise to look at all your choices first!"
3,A learning tool,"I order this book inorder to recieve some insight on the history of sexual behavior in various culture. I found this book to be a helpful guild, funny and a good tool to use in my creative writing on sexual history."
1,does not stay put,This product does not stay suctioned to the side of the sink or inside sink wall. Falls off when holding sponge.
1,Didn't work,Tried attaching this to my tile sink splashboard... never would hold. Tried reattaching several times and would consistently fall off.
4,Great find for that music lover in your family!,I bought this cd for my parents who grew up in this time period with these songs. I don't know if they have been listening to it or not but I know that they recognized all the songs and found it to be a great compilation.
4,Pinwheel,"This pinwheel is a nice idea. My daughter loves working with me in our garden, painting, and pinwheels, so it seemed like a great combination of those interests. She was REALLY excited about it, and enjoyed painting the petals. There are two problems, though, which have to do with her being a preschooler handling this toy. First, the paintbrush easily broke into two pieces, which had to be stuck back together. Second, one of the black plastic components snapped, and this was a bit of a disaster, since it's the one that connects the ""stem"" to the back, larger petal. I tried superglue and a hot glue gun, but neither worked, because of the plastic and the weight of the flowers. So I had to find a way to attach the flowers to the base, and this doesn't allow the back set of petals to spin. But they don't really spin anyway, they're so heavy! When it's fully assembled and stays in one piece, this flower looks really pretty in our garden!"
1,DO NOT BUY!!,I purchased this product after ankle surgery. The foam grips and pads were terrible and fell apart. I have only had the product for two weeks and the metal as already gone through the bottom grip. I am by no means near the maximum weight. I work in an office and sit most of the time. All in all I would not recommend that you buy.
1,Very disappointed,"I know you get what you pay for, but I was thinking these crutches were like the standard aluminum crutches I was replacing. Wrong! First, when I unwrapped the package the smell of the CHEAP rubber on the underarm part about knocked me over. Its a strong chemical smell and mothballs combined! The underarm and hand grip covers are just that, COVERS. There is no padding whatsoever. Now I know the true definition of cheap crutches. These! Would return them but would cost more to package and send them than they are worth. I can't get them in the garbage soon enough."
1,Typical crutches,"Since my doctor gave me these, it figures he'd give me ones typical of the old-fashioned type. I broke my ahkle a week ago and it's been very difficult getting around in my townhouse, where I broke my ankle in the first place. Sure they're not that heavy, but I see why he gave me these---they're not very expensive. My armpits aren't in pain from them, but then again I don't travel great distances in them. With all the technologies out there, you'd think he would have given me something better and that will help provide shock support. I'm going to try the folding Millenia crutches next. I like there's shock support.These are great if you just want basic crutches. But face it folks---basic crutches are awful on your hands and arms. Get something better please. Your aching muscles will thank you."
3,gold color wears off,"I have had this watch for some time and it runs great! The bracelet band stays securely fastened. My only complaint is that the gold color wears off after a while, so now it looks partly silver and partly gold."
4,Cute show,"My girl really like this show. It's not very educational, but it's very cute. They both want to be ballerinas now :-)"
5,Cute and Adorable,"I love Angelina Ballerina. She is so cute and adorable and she always does the right thing, even it if takes awhile. This DVD is full of five episodes all revolving around Angelina and her ballet dancing! The DVD starts out with Angelina's family moving across town, which means new friends, a new school, and a new dance teacher. Angelina lies to the school because she is nervous about the change, but in the end realizes it is going to be great. I think this episode is great because I know how scary moving can be for kids and this shows how it can be a fun new adventure. The other episodes are just as good and focus on Angelina and her little sister, her new dance teacher and school, and are all full of dancing and singing!"
2,WAAngelina WHINEerina!,"My 3 year-old suddenly became ballet obsessed, so I purchased this. Between the British accent (which should sound lovely) and all the whining she does, I can't stand this DVD. Thankfully it's not one of my daughter's favorites either. Why can't she be a nice mouse? Whine! Whine! Whine! Waaaaaangelina!"
3,Beward of mold,Very moldy - even when completely submerged in the soil. Didn't like the fact of having mold spread.
5,very hard,This was a very fun yet challenging puzzle my roommate actually solved it before i did. Even after he showed me how to do it i still couldn't figure it out. so if you don't have patience don't make the purchase.
4,Superb for it's price,"I recently bought this dvd player and I have to say it's incredible. It has the essentials of a good dvd player, but not all the capabalities of reading CD-R's and so-forth. It has great sound options. So, even if you don't have surround sound, it sounds acceptional. The only problem that I've seen is that when you mark your spot in the movie, it only stays there saved as long as you don't eject the dvd or turn the dvd player off. Besides that, this dvd is a great buy with great picture and sound. This is a must get for anybody who just wants a cheap dvd player that has the essentials fulfilled."
1,Magnavox DVD611,"Absolute Garbage! freezes, skips, refuses to load DVD, buttons on face or remote inoperable while DVD is stuck inside. Don't buy this, just returned mine to Circuit City and purchased a different brand. DVD's that wouldnt work, or worked poorly on Magnavox, work flawlessly on new Machine."
2,"Great at first, but now...?","This machine ran fine for a while then we started having problems with it skipping repeatedly and freezing. You can't get the disk out when it has frozen...you have to wait for it to finish ""thinking"" and that is so annoying! Some days, it works fine, then a rash of skipping and freezing again. Plus, it tends to overheat..the disks would come out very, very warm. Right now, it plays the disk, but there is no sound, so the kids are having to watch their movies on the computer DVD-rom. I think my husband would agree, this player doesn't hold up at all."
1,terribly frustrating machine,"I bought the magnavox thinking it had all the basic features I needed. But it constantly freezes on disks. We have to rent VHS if we want to see a movie and even our pampered DVD's that we own won't play all the way through. Maybe we just got a lemon, but it sounds like lots of people have the same problem. DVD players are no longer very expensive. Pay a little more to get a good one and forget about the magnavox. There's nothing more frustrating than missing the end of a movie because you've got a piece of junk."
1,Absolutely Terrible,This is a terrible product! don't let the other reviews fool you. This machine isn't worth the time or effort. You will put more time into trying to make the dvd's play than actually enjoying your movie. Every time that I play a disc it skips or shuts off! It makes noises at you constantly and takes forever to load anything. It doesn't matter if the dvd's are new or not. I am truly upset that I wasted the money on this machine. IT ONLY GETS WORSE THE LONGER YOU OWN IT! I have had this product for more than 90 days and the skipping now happens after every thirty minutes. Don't waste your money. Invest in something that you know will work proporly!
3,Caution!,"Be aware that you will need to buy a R-F Converter with this if you have a TV input with only 1 co-ax cable.you will find this out after some of your copy procted DVD's won't play.Read the fine print on page 8 of the Owners manual!You have been warned, F. Chromzak"
1,Worse than the cheapest VCR,"This is the bottom end product for a reason. The playback is worse than the cheapest VCR, with the colors switching in and out from what they are supposed to be to a hideous red color. It ejects DVD's when it feels like it - not when it is supposed to.This machine isn't worth the box it comes in."
2,"Good Plot, But Not Very Exciting","The Hardys are asked to investigate the disappearance of a man who was bringing a very valuable unknown object back with him from Colombia. Also, a world-renowned spy wishes to defect to the U.S., but the terrorist organization that he works for will do anything to stop him. I thought that the plot of this book was rather interesting; however, I didn't find that the book had that much action. I would expect a book featuring a terrorist group to be loaded with action, but this really wasn't. A lot of the chapter cliffhangers I found to be dull. I understand that this book is meant for young readers and, as such, the amount of violence should be kept to a minimum while still having the book be exciting. I'm not saying that there isn't any action in it, but I think that there could have been more."
3,so far so good + great price,"The keyboard stickers make my typing so esay. greatprice + fast deliverd, easy to fix on."
5,Excellent,"I bought these sticker for my laptop, these stickers are the best ever experiencedThey are clear & dont hide the original letters, you cant tell that there are stickers have installed"
4,It did the job,"Good solution for non-Arabic keyboardsTransparent, clear lettering and good pricejust a little hassle to stick the letters"
4,"Different than photo, but good quality","This seller was great. The stickers are high quality and do not come off the keys. However, I have a Mac, with a slightly different keyboard layout. The characters are the same placement, except for the characters typed in using the shift key. The stickers include the ' ' 'etc which are different on the Mac."
2,Predictable,"I used this book for a ""finding a college major"" class. Unfortunately it is the same old tired questions that I had heard all my life. If you are young and lost, it might be helpfull but, if you have taken tests for finding your career etc., it is not very helpfull."
1,"Different video, same title!","Apparently most or all the sellers of this ""Movie Maker"" are actually offering the 1987 version, a comedy starring Zsa Zsa Gabor & David Hedison, directed by Jim Wilson. When I asked several of the sellers to check, they discovered they DO NOT in fact have what Amazon indicates they have, after all! I.e., the sellers DO NOT have the 1964 version of ""Movie Maker,"" a serious drama with Dabney Coleman & Rod Steiger, directed by Joseph Lejtes! -- Prof Steven P Hill, Cinema Studies, University of Illinois."
4,Bought it for the Keypad and USB hub,"I love the usb and keypad. That is the main reason why I got it. The mouse however is too small for my liking. I have small hands but the mouse is way too small. I had an extra mouse so it didn't bother me but because my desktop mouse died, I used my extra mouse for that. Leaving me to use the travel mouse. I do like that the wire in the mouse can extend. Too bad the keypad couldn't do that. I got this in May 2008. I used it mostly when I primarily used the laptop (which was about 4 or 5 months). Now, I only use it if I am in school, when I go out of town or if my boyfriend is on my computer."
4,A must read for anyone in business!!,"This is the story of Les Schwab and his company. He tells how he started in the tire business and shares with the reader his ideas on building a successful business through building successful employees. Les is a businessman not a writer, but like in business, he gets his points across. He is the undisputed king of the tire business in the Pacific Northwest. His is the largest independent tire business in the world and he makes it look easy. If you are in business or want to be in business you must read this book."
5,Old Fashioned Wisdom,"This is an excellent book. Les was a hard charger and an old fashioned guy. He provides a great set of insights on building a company and it's filled with engaging stories and facts.It also provides some useful perspective on the current direction of the U.S. and governments (somewhat unintentionally I expect) that is thought provoking.Les earned what we would call a ""working man's PhD"" and this book describes his course of study.On a more modern note his structure on setting up semi-autonomous dealerships to expand rapidly is worth dusting off and adapting to our current times. That horse looks ready to have another run around the track."
5,one of the best of their career,"the curse of blondie is one of the best albums of 2004,there wastracks like goodboys,undone,and golden rod. This album rocks!"
3,lacks depth,"This book lacks the depth I was looking for. They often use Great Briton gardening phrases and speak to an audience that never has to deal with real issues like tough winters, using solar heat, practical insect control using good bugs and organics."
2,Not enough in depth information for a small green house,The author was trying to cover a large area of information. The book needed to restrict its information to people with a small greenhouse and its needs.
3,The author is from England,"Book is OK but requires some translation from English to American. Also, seems to be written only from the standpoint of greenhouses and conservatories that are in England and the English climate. I have never heard of many of the plants mentioned in this book, possibly because they are called something different in the US or maybe not available here at all. I have also never heard of 'growing bags' which he spends loads of time discussing and apparently dirt is a rare commodity in the part of England where he lives. I specifically wanted to learn about starting and growing vegetables in the Midwestern US and this is definitely not the book for me."
4,Greenhouse,"Coming from a country where I didn't need a greenhouse I knew absolutely nothing about what to do, when, how etc. This will be of great use."
2,Not worth the money,"This book seemed hastily prepared, and describes the subject of airline management in language which is almost vague enough to apply to management of a large company in any industry, rather than focusing on the particular aspects of airline management which set it apart from other industries. I found the book very overpriced at $70"
5,Piglet rocks my booty,"This album is what would happen if Don Caballero had a sense of humor. Who knew complicated song structures and abrupt time changes could be so damn funny? Not a sombre drone to be heard here, nor a long build-up to a roaring crescendo. Just a guitar, bass, and drums with chops out the wazoo.This type of music generally hinges on tight drumming and that's abundantly true for Piglet. If you want to know what Lava Land sounds like, look at the cover. That's what it sounds like. For people who like this sort of thing, it's the sort of thing they'll like a lot."
4,Rad but Short,"If you would close your eyes upon popping this cd into your record player, you would think it was some crazy offspring of el ten eleven meets don cab . which by the way is RAD. the drumming is tight to the point of being something all drummers should inspire to reach in technical and creative skill. and if anyone here, likes those sweet minus the bear parts where the singer shuts his mouth for a second , and lets the music kill it thats pretty much what every song on here is like. thank god for the lack of a singer . the guitars are a different story in itself , if jazz was this good I might dress up in a suit and pretend that i was high and mighty just to enjoy it. really the only problem is the cd is short and now apparently really high priced."
5,buddha,"Very good for times when you wish to contemplate, read, dine, practice yoga, or need an atmosphere produced so you can be calm to focus on a project."
3,hmmmmm,"i like icp, but i dont think this is one of their best cds..I liked the song Please dont hate me alot.. its different from all their other cds..its like icp gone pop in some songs..."
1,Public service announcement,I dont like ICP. They make me mad. Now I'm not happy. We should be happy. Please don't purchase any ICP so I can stay happy. Flowers and kind words are better than fire and sulfur
5,G0D DAM DIZ ALBUM GOOD IS,"I LOV DIS ALBUM JUZT LOVE IT ANY 0NE WHO DONT LIK DIZ IS A JUGFFAHGOE - I HATE JUFFGAHODS LOOK MAAAAN IM GON A TELL ABOUT JUFGOES NOW,A STORYY :- OEN DAY AT YHE MALL I SEAW A GUY WIT A PCI AND MAZE YA LIVE GUY T SRITH AND U I SAYD WASSAP HOM|,FAAAAAMILY,BUT TE GUY F SAYJ FUXXX OFF THEN RUNED AWAY THEN I SAYD FUXX YOUR JUFFAH0E MOM THEN I WENT INTO THE RECORD SHOP THEN I BUY PCI SHRTS THEN I GOT MONEY TFROM MY JUFFAHOE MOM MY MOM NDONT LIKKKE PCI,WSHAT A FUXXIN H9E MAN FUXX YA MOMZ JUFFSOHE YA MEEAN?

1,Tererible,The Insane Clown posse is so insanely bad they suck and they cant rap buy illmatic instead you diis illmatic you freaks and my Black friends will kick your little High School butts
4,This is great!,It's not ICP's best but it's still great and any Juggalo out there should have this in there collection ;)
2,Bizaar,"I became a fan of ICP because of their darker heavier music. But that's almost completely forgotten on this record while they go for a comedic approach. Instead check out the older stuff like Riddlebox, or Twixtid's Freekshow."
4,Cool....very Violent,"VIolent J has centainly earned his name and shaggy 2 dope has been pretty dope himself. these two deserve money. they are great. they may not be the most talented in the rap & metal biz but they have created something nobody else could ever have the juggalo-painted balls to do. buy this album for shizzledon't be mislead by the 12 track album because the last track has bonus songs and its nearly 25 minutes long! it includes phone conversations, freestyles, funny jokes, 1 minute rap, mama jokes & an appearance from vanilla ice at the very end.2 best songs- Tilt a WHirl & We Gives No F***2 Worst Songs-intro & my homey babymoma"
4,get it,not near as good as their older stuff where is the dark songs like 12 and dead body man they use to make. Im still a fan of their music but they should of took the best songs on both albums and just made one real good album and it would of sold more copies. Lets go all the way and cherry pie are the best songs on this one make sure to pick up the other one too.
4,A little disappointing,"First off just know that this is not a negative review not completely anyway. There are way too many songs on here that just scream out whack when You here them, but there are some songs on here that erase the awful songs and still make this a 4 star album. This album is crazy funny, I don't hink I have ever luaghed so hard listening to music before in my life, but most of these songs are way to lighthearted for my tastes. I prefer the darker subject matter better. The song whut is a really incredible song The beat is really tight and the lyrics have a good mix of luagh out loud and kill your A$$ moments.The low point on this album have to be the song rainbows and stuff That song had me wanting to throw this f**kin C.D. across my room. Not ICP's best album but a definate buy for juggalos."
5,"Funny, Serious, and Just Plain Out Freaky","This cd is funny as hell. They have a sense of humor that is very funny. There other cd ""Bizzar"" isn't as good. The song ""Please Don't Hate Me"" ha a twist to the end of it. ""Rainbows and Stuff"" talks about things that they like. And ""Behind the Paint"" is there most serious song on the album. It talks about the conflicts with there daily life and there own history. I would rate this cd better than all of there others. They are in a conflict with Eminem at the moment, but don't buy Eminem's cd's. They aren't as good. Also, lift up the black inside to reveal a picture of Twizted (without the paint)."
5,another slam dunk!,"yo, icp does it again with bizaar. this cd is helly funny. it's different than their other stuff. not at all dark or serious, but wicked funny. it's got some phat hits for twiztid, and i laughed the whole way through it. this is seriously light hearted carnival fun for all juggalos! a must have!"
1,Disappointing to a long-time fan,"We bought this CD to add to our collection of all her albums, ecpecting it to be as good as the others. We have all of her recordings, and used to see her live whenever we could. She is as good a Cajun musician as ever took a stage. Perhaps the best. We are so disappointed with the musical direction she has chosen.She needs to return to what she does best. This is just mediocre pop rock. We gave it away."
4,A Very Solid Performance,"This is the first album I've purchased of this band, and it is impressive. Many of the compositions are compelling, and the band members are quite adept and well-rehearsed."
2,not like what I used to buy at Target,"I couldn't find this product at Target anymore, so I was excited to see it on Amazon. However, it's extremely streaky & has a liquidy consistency. I remember it being more creamy & less streaky."
5,Very nice,"Just bought my 50P8341, set it up a few days ago. Real nice picture, easy to set up, grest sound as well. I'm pretty impressed. Good for cable TV and awesome DVD watching. Real shweet deal for the price ! I'm happy."
5,The best read I've had since the Sea Wolf,"Deeply philsophical, intelligent, and, at moments, humorous. Bukowski is genius. I personally love the compilations of poems rather than a book. I can read for short periods, between duties, or go for hours because of the raw depth he has compiled into his life and words."
4,One Last Bukowski Book - YEAH!,"This May not be Bukowski's best collection -- but it remains an enjoyable collection, most notable for being his last. I'm certainly happy that it found it's way into print. Here's are the usual themes of loneliness, desolation, confusion about women and love -- all laced with a gallows humor that never left Bukowski, in spite of his obvious misery. I recommend this book along with LOVE IS A DOG FROM HELL, SOMETIMES YOU GET SO ALONG, POST OFFICE, FACTOTUM and another recent non-Buk Amazon pick, THE LOSERS' CLUB by Richard Perez."
2,swishy graphics w/ content seen thru forest of typography,"Not having actually read the book, but merely a chore just to browse thru it, i believe that this book is compiled as it was meant to be used. the swishy graphics are seductive and the essays are short enough to appeal to the short attention spans of the mtv generation of young architects (to which i belong, lest anyone critique this critique on that basis).i do agree that for content rem will not be able to surpass his manifesto delirious new york- but have you met anyone who has actually read that? all in all, i recommend pooling resources and buying this tome as a group read, or perusing it at the local library, if it is actually available"
4,So far.... so Good,"So far, this player has been great. Audio quality with CDs seems terrific. DVD picture quality is good (at least with the S-video connect). I noticed the player had a slight skip in one of the movies we played, but has otherwise worked fine.The MP3 feature is nice, especially for a unit [of this price]. The title of the MP3s are listed on the TV and the sound is great. However, playback of the MP3s seems to be limited in that the machine seems unable to randomly play the tracks.The remote control is rather unimpressive and small, but otherwise, we've been very pleased with the product. So far... so good."
1,lemon,product wouldn't function .didn't recognize/play discs of any type.cd drawer gets stuck 1/2 way.owners manual somewhat too generalized.hookup instructions toooooooooo confusing for 1st time buyers of this type of player.very poor product.
3,Average...yawn,"This was o.k. It was a little boring, I was expecting something more sensual and and enlightening, but it is just basically a woman being pleasured by a man, and not even that well.It is not pornographic and is a welcome change from other similar genre items that focus entirely on the man's pleasure and ignore the woman's, however it could be more educational with good techniques, more focus on other areas of the body, and include much more sensuality."
3,sensitivity for the clueless may be a better title,The sound track is absolutly phenomenal! I watch it just to listen to Jullian Speers.The video itself would be a good present for an insensitive and clueless man. He may only view it as pornography.There are some good learning points concerning massage and the direction and sharing of energies.
4,A little shaky...,"When I heard Gotta Tell You on the radio, I said to myself, ""I gotta get this CD"" When I listened to it on my portable cd player, I listened to the other songs and was a little shaky about it. The songs are good, but I don't think they could catch an 11-year-old or under's mind. More than 50% of the songs are slow and weren't like Gotta Tell You."
5,Gotta Tell You that it's great!,"I've only heard this album from a friend- I don't actually have it. All the songs stand out on it. Samantha has a great voice, unlike any of the Britneys and Christinas. She's got a talent for writing songs, too. I hope she comes out with a follow-up just as good as this one!"
4,Telling You About This,"I just got my copy of Gotta Tell You today and I am not disappointed. My favorite song Gotta Tell You is the first to play, but Body II Body is just as great in my opinion. She'll definitely be a name that will be around for some time."
1,I Give Her Effort...but...,"No, no, no, no! I mean, I give her credit for trying to pursue her dream, but why pursue it if you sing like a retarded cow and look like one too? She looks like one of those starving children on those commercials with a good hairdo. Besides that, her vocals are weak and blank sounding."
5,SIMPLY STUNNING!,"With a powerful, stunning voice Mrs. Walker captures the listeners heart from the first note she sings. Her personal emotions come through on every track! I am sitting here, waiting patiently, for her next masterpiece!!!"
3,...good grounded in reality...,"this type of movie is rare and very good, honest and enjoyable at that...as others have highlighted it is a candid look at peoples post college life styles, choices, relationships...while I enjoyed it a lot I found the sex scenes a little too phallically focused, what with the male masturbation scene in the shower thru to ejaculation, the rolling on of the male condom on the penis...and while there was female nudity it was not as explicit...so if you dont mind male nudity then this should be a good movie to watch as a couple..."
5,Not Slick -- A Melt Your Own Butter Film,"If you're looking for the same old thing, opening, slick, titles, music, relax, sit back, eat some popcorn, blah, blah, blah and whatever, whatever, whatever, buy something else. Buy a studio movie and enjoy. Microwave your popcorn because you don't want to take the time to pop it right and melt your own butter.If you're open and adventurous, a lover of discovery, check out this film.It's not Bruckheimer. It's not Ron Howard's latest pastel painting.It is what it is, with no apologies.This review might be of no help to anyone. But, I think those who need to get it will get it. And to those: Watch this film. It's exceptional."
3,the story is true to life but tends to drag on in just the short 78 minutes its allowed on screen,"Interesting camera work and documentary-like feel of the movie are unfortunately not enough to distract from the overbearing voiceovers (ofter real interviews with real twentysomethings). Furthermore, the abrupt storytelling leaver something to be desired. The movie feels intimate and engaging and honest at first but, ultimately, the characters are hard to care and emphasize with."
1,Not Worth Your Time,I will keep it simple and short. I purchased this on 12/2008 saw it and did not like it. The story lacked all over the place. Save yourself time and money.
1,BEYOND BAD !!!!,"This movie was BAD from beginning to the very end. Poorly written,Poorly acted and HORRIBLY FILMED . I couldn't wait to rip it out of my DVD player and throw it in the garbage."
2,This is a tiny ball!,"No where does it state online how big this is...but looking at the picture, it seemed about right for me. Well, the chick in the picture must really short. The ball is only about 15 inches across. I'm gonna give this to my 5 year old."
3,Hard to read,"The print in this book is very hard to read. Deciphering when a plural form requires an umlaut is well nigh impossible. It's cheap, and for good reason. On the positive side, there is a lot of information on alternate forms and idiomatic uses - if your eyesight is extra sharp."
3,A bit too concise,"Too much information jammed into too little space: virtually impossible to read without a microscope; deciphering ""How to Use This Dictionary"" is like trying put together a Chinese jig-saw puzzle."
3,Marred by Video Editing,"Both video and audio quality of this DVD are very good. The editing spoils the show a bit for us pianists. Lots of camera angles and lots of time spent away from the keyboard. During the whole ""arpeggios"" etude you don't see her hands at all. Makes you wonder if there was some kind of problem.There is no printed enclosure to tell you about the pianist or the recording."
1,Not worth the money,"The sound quality on the video isn't great. There are no separate audio files and I can't find a way to extract the audio so there doesn't seem to be a way to listen with my iPod.I get more enjoyment from listening to the tracks available on YouTube, even though the sound quality isn't great there either."
3,Nice to See Chopin Etudes Performed In Their Entirety...But Some Reservations,"It was satisfying to see the complete etudes performed by an aspiring professional. Nevetheless, I wish there had been less focus on the ""visuals"" of the performance. It was a bit distracting to see the young female pianist playing piano in what appeared to be ""a blue silk nightgown"" with over-applied red lipstick. I also didn't care for the continuosly shifting camera angles. Because of the constant shifting of camera angles, the DVD gave the impression of having been ""spliced together"" during editing. The pianist's fingers should have given me a sense of tempo, not the editor's splicing. One gets the sense the music was not served by such distractions. Nevertheless, it was a pleasing ambitious performance by an aspiring pianist of a solid caliber."
5,"Grandmaster Kim takes you on a peaceful, recharging journey.","Tae Yun Kim takes you into a peaceful, relaxing world. Allowing me to let go of the daily stress and maintain a positive attitude. Whisper to Your Soul leaves me charged up and helps stay focused and acknowledge my appreciation of life. In the midst of rush hour traffic it helps me channel positive energy rather then be stressed out by what is happening around me. Whether I simply want to relax, be inspired or need to release stress, I enjoy listening to Whisper throughout the day."
3,We'll see,"This glove is all that I wanted.But only time will tell if it's the real deal.My 50+ year old Dad had 2 Rawlings gloves during his life. He is still using the 2nd one. With some degree of hope, this glove will last me more than 2 years."
4,An Informative Reference Book.,"I am pleased with the general contents of this book which is very informative. But considering the price I would not expect to find proof reading errors as on page 1X in the introduction, the setence ""A conscious decision........."" appears 3 times in the 3rd paragraph. Page 107, written description ends ""the handle was"" this sentence then continues on page 124 not 108 as you would expect!!!! Considering R & R Books say they focus on technological excellence, it is a bit disappointing that this book was published with these discrepencies. I would also like if possible to contact the author J A Bowman, as I would like to discuss a particular item and it's markings. Thank you"
5,Alpphbet Circus,I teach at a preschool ...The kids love it!! We show the video once a week. It has really helped the children to learn their ABC'S
4,Very informative book!,This is a must have for thoes who are interested in the final days of Siggy and how his life and mind deteriated towards the end.
4,read the fine print....,"This ""Diary"" is actually a collection of scribblings found on Freud's desk after he died. The Diary itself sticks to the last ten years of Freud's life and consists of single phrases: ""Doctor's Appointment""; ""Editorial Committee Meeting,"" etc. which are then explained at length.Given that, this is an interesting compilation sprinkled with intriguing images and photographs. I'd rate it a 5 if it weren't for the poor advertising."
2,I've Read Better,"Being a true DL fan, This book basicly [stunk].I have a tendency to Compare all DL Books to ""The Legend of Huma"" and when done so, this book is lacking.The begining is slow, the write had no idea how to shape a book based on a dwarf. Don't get me wrong, I like Dwarves, they are one of the better races of krynn, but this one was just, bleh.I continually wanted to find another book. I made myself read it all the way through, and about the middle of the book, it gets pretty good, but the action can't hold this one above water. The rest of the storyline and character descriptions are just way to gone to call it good.This book [stunk]. If you have nothing else to read, then, by all means this one is for you, but if you can scrape up the $10.00 for a new one, do it! Save this one for when you are ready for bed, because it will put you to sleep!"
5,One of the finest DL books,"Berberick puts on a fine storytelling display with this book. Sadly, it came out from TSR, which has a negative reputation among readers of fantasy literature. As a result, a fine book like this gets overlooked by those who would be interested in it. Good characterization, good plot development, good reread value - I find little wrong with this little gem. Recommended."
4,well?????,"great book, I'll take nothing away from it, but the only problem I had with it is that the main character getts permanetly injured, his best friend dies along with almost everyone else. great book if you like realizm"
2,Yet another attempt to cash in on the saga,"Like most of the ""Dragonlance"" books not authored by Weis and Hickman, this novel gives us characters that we never really warm up to and a storyline that doesn't really fall into place with the rest of the series. A total downer and a waste of good wood pulp."
3,Fun game but online headache!!,"I really love this game. I played the demo first, and played it online. I bought the full version thinking I would never have to mess with the demo again. But the only way the full version can connect to the internet is through the demo disc swap. Witch wouldn't be that bad if it had a save feature but it don't so you have to use both the demo and the full version EVERYTIME you play online. If you have dial up and get disconnected, look for more disc swaping before your game is up and running again. What a headache. Other than that the game is fun and addicting."
3,amplitude is better,amplitude is almost the same game but with way better graphics and sounds. the game itself just looks a lot better when playing it. frenquences is fun and all but i still recomment AMPLITUDE over this one.
4,"So addicting and Fun, in a strange way...","This game is unbelievably addicting. If you like music, and if you have played tetris, this is the game for you. Who thought pressing three buttons over and over could be so fun? In frequency, you choose a song that they have on 5 different stages, and instrument by instrument, you add the notes to the song, and when you get through the whole song, you have the finished symphony. This is a great game, and definately recommended."
2,Long over short,"Unfortunately, this abridged version (with no indication of it on the cover) chops out several hundred pages of necessary information that would satisfy the readers' feelings of vindication for the Count. Opt for the unabridged edition to truly enjoy this wonderful, emotional adventure."
1,Abridged,"Very upset to purchase this and then find out it is an abridged version. It mentions this nowhere on the cover of the book and it wasn't until I saw the title page that I realized it. Of course, it is too old for me to take back so I am stuck with it.If you WANT abridged, that is fine, but I find it irresponsible of Barnes and NOble not to mention this."
4,Good book,"I enjoyed this book. I was unable to get it as fast as I would have liked, but it arrived in good condition. This book also included a very good narrative of the author that gave me some insight into the classic story."
5,Count of Monte Cristo,"This book is a perfect example of the greatness of classic novels. I recommend reading the book before seeing the movie. Both are great, but through the book you are given greater detail and appreciation of the story, setting, and characters. A must read for a classic novels lover!"
2,White Corner Hutch,"The hutch is a nice looking piece of furniture, and it was relatively easy to put together, but as we were putting it together, some of the pieces didn't line up correctly. The side board had an extrememly large gap and the drawn has a large space and doesn't line up. I don't feel that it is worth the money I paid for it and for the price it should be better made. I also feel that Target should sell these items in their stores and not just on-line."
5,A closer look at St. Catherine of Siena through her writing,"I really enjoyed reading this, particularly the letters included that St. Catherine wrote. There are volumes of letters that have yet to be translated, but this was a great introduction, along with some prayer-poems and portions from ""The Dialogue.""St. Catherine is so compassionate and loving, and funny, too, that (like St. Teresa of Avila)reading her writing is like talking with a close friend. I would recommend this to everyone!"
2,"MP3 capability is good, DVD quality suffers","THough I may have a defective unit (I am about to send it back to Philips) this unit drops about 30 seconds of audio after any PAUSE, FWD, REV, or layer change. Makes it REALLY annoying to go back and watch something over again. On the plus side, a DVD/MP3 combo for [this price] is a great deal. I picked it up at Costco, but they QUICKLY discontinued carrying ANY Philips DVD players. Maybe too many returns??? Let me know your experience with this unit..."
2,"Good price, poor performance","The first couple of months the product was terrific, but then we noticed that the on/off button rarely works now, and the DVD freezes constantly. I don't know if it is a lemon, but it is very poor quality performance wise."
2,Decent,"The first time we played a CD in this DVD player, it refused to come out. We tried everything. I took it back to the store I purchased it at and they had no clue as to how to eject the CD. We finally took a screwdriver to the disk tray and popped the whole unit out. They replaced it with a new player.We've had no problems with the new one, but the remote is full of buttons we never use, and with the problems we've had with this model, we realize we should have just waited a few months until the price on DVD players dropped (...)Bottom line: don't bother with it for this price!"
5,Great Album,Absolutely an amazing album....a much fuller sound than MMMM from '05...I highly recommend this album to people who've known Tally Hall for years and people who never heard of them...this album has a little bit of something for everyone!
4,Awesome Band,"Product arrived quickly, in good condition, and I've had no issuesTally Hall y'all...check it out"
2,Marsha's Big Night,"Album and band reminds me of ""The Hot Band"" the protagonist can't get enough of, or that acts a plot foil on a Sherwood Schwartz television comedy (Brady Bunch, Gilligan's Island etc); the sort as a viewer you suspend belief about, because the fact that the music is so lame isn't what the episode is really about...it's all about MarshaDerivative dribble, this sterile pop might fly as free music on the Diag or at a really geeky frat party - but it's not anything that meets the ""Do you like Music? Good, Then You'll Love This ..."" test.If you are over the age of 14, don't make the mistake of saying, ""This is a great up and coming band!"" You'll be laughed out of the used CD shop two months later when you are trying to turn MMMM over for a quick buck. Colored ties, white shirts - get it?"
5,brilliant,"surely some of the most engaging music from a not so traditional rock band. its fun to discover something really new that pulls you in and wont let go. in an overcrowded field of ""me to"" mediocrity Tally Hall is the later day reincarnation of the Talking Heads, Beatles and Devo all in one. And they do hip hop too."
5,Amazing debut album,"Tally Hall's debut album is amazing. This group offers a greater variety of music than any other band out there today. Each song is unique, and they are all very memorable. I listen to this CD constantly and highly recommend it to anyone looking for something a little different."
2,Oh noes,My boyfriend bought me this watch when it went on sale for $30 and i was super excited because i thought 70% off was such a great deal. as i put it on it fits well and nice and he asks to see the little metal thing inside of it. I go to unbutton and take it out and the stitching on the leaterh rips and there goes my watch.. within 30 mintues demolished. Crappy quality band and stitching is what made me knock it down 3 stars but the metal watch part itself was cool looking.. i guess thats all i have left
3,Baby clothes,"I gave this for a present for a Baby Shower of my future nephew, 10 bodysuits very actual and cute."
3,not the best but not the worst,"agreed with the below review, this book is short on a lot of things, but it's still an interesting read. i was going searching for ettedgui's cinematography book, when i found this instead and decided to pick it up. it's a quick, easy read, and there are some nice anecdotes, but there is a lot of information lacking. lots of name-dropping from designers on who they love and by the author on who helped him out. if you're a design buff, i'd recommend the book on the level of hearing from some of the master of the trade. if you're looking for information, i'd say take it elsewhere. this is the least educational book on movies i've come into reading, but i'm not complaining because it's also the easiest to read (the others were practically tech manuals)."
5,"An essential band, an essential album. A must!!!","The Call are a very underrated band. Their singer, Michael Been, has an extremely powerful voice, and it's perfect for the group. The band was well deserving of a collection in UMG's 20th Century Masters series. Read on for the positives and negatives.Positives-Every single one of The Call's hits are here. 'Let The Day Begin,' 'The Walls Came Down,' 'Everywhere I Go,' and 'Modern Romans' are all here.-The sound quality is excellent.NegativesNone.The Call are very underrated, and should have gained much more popularity than they did. And this collection serves them justice. Highly recommended."
5,Excellent,I have searched high and low for a study guide for the Roma Gypsy language. This is the closest dialect and best I have found!
4,Sellers,"The sellers are fine, but the book is a little confusing. I'm no expert at self-teaching, especially not languages, so this book seems a little difficult to me. No doubt it is because I have only looked through it casually."
2,its dull,"THis man founded an movement in the business world where real men spoke about asking GOd to send out angels to help other people. this book is his life story and it misses the power in singing, the power in praise and the power of Angels....I learned so much and Benny Hinn attended many lunches with Full Gospel, but movement died off and this is a dead org. the older men died and the stroies of faith and pwer died with them . sad...i tried to gather men but it fizzled too"
5,been takingthese the past year,love this brand- doesnt upset my stomach- has greatly improved my health. good price. no back taste. i do wish some of the minerals would just be a wee bit higher potassium especially but all in all i'm pleased with how well these vitamins work.
1,Not as Advertised,"I did not receive the product in the advertised package. Insttead, I received three small bottles consisting of 60 pills each. There was no expiration date indicated on these bottles. The outer package, containing the expiration date was removed. When I brought this to the attention of Amazon, my purchase price was refunded."
2,Very bad stomach aches,"When I take one, even after a meal, I get bad stomach pains. I have to sit next to a heater or lay under a blanket for about half an hour to endure it. I thought it was the ginkgo, but it appears there are similar complaints for other Centrum products."
3,Don't trust that handle!,"It's a nice and sturdy cooler. Too bad the handle snapped on me with less than 4 pounds of produce inside, after a trip to the grocery store! I guess I am lucky it didn't snap when I had a 12 pack of glass beer bottles in there, or anything like that.Now, I'm trying to get a new handle from Igloo. It is my contention that it should be replaced for free, but I also told them I am willing to buy a handle. Their response? Send a photo of the handle, so they'll know if they have it. I would think they should know their own products, but they don't.On the other hand, Coleman sent me a FREE set of hinges on a cooler we'd had for about 8 years after I wrote them to BUY the part.So, buy with caution. Pack with even more caution."
5,Crashing Through,"Robert Kurson has done it again! He is a new writer, and he is a very gifted writer who is going to get very famous! I am looking foreward to his next book. I loved his first book, ""Shadow Divers"", and this newest book, ""Crashing Through"" is really great reading, also! His research before writing is outstanding - he knows his subject and writes so you understand it, too! Both of these books are true stories, which make them even more enjoyable to read. Robert Kurson writes so well that you don't want to put his books down once you've started reading them!"
3,"fascinating story, if not always a fascinating book","This is such a fascinating story that it really overcomes some of the story-telling which just didn't really turn me on. But if you have an interest in how the brain works, and how it affects what we see, this book is a must. My daughter has cortical vision impairment and so I found this book EXTREMELY helpful in discussing different ways of seeing and ways in which we can help people learn how to see with clues. If you know anyone who is visually impaired it is really a must read."
5,"Fantastic, Compelling!! Read it!","Wow, what a book! I haven't read an entire book in 24 hours in years, but this one completely captivated me. The character development of the individuals in this true story makes you feel as if you know them personally. Not only is the story engrossing, but the way the science of the eye, vision and the brain is woven in is simply terrific. Kurson leads the reader on a winding journey with emotional highs and lows. This book will make you look at the gift of sight and life in a new way. If you enjoy both science, psychology and a true tale of facing challenges, this is the book for you."
2,Crashing into obstacles,"The disturbing image of the youthful Michael May running blind and crashing into schoolyard goalposts remained with me throughout my reading of this book. I was disappointed by the presentation and was not all that enamoured of the protagonist himself. Make no mistake, his sporting achievements were impressive. However, his incessant bragging about his attractive wife could only make me smirk at the irony of a blind man obsessed with female pulchritude. Using his new eyesight to leer at the girls walking past a local coffeeshop was just plain juvenile! Yes it's true he never got a chance to do this during his immature teenager years, but still. The book was dull and boring when I had expected so much more; the writing was pedestrian and cliched. This could have been so much better. The most meaningful part of the biography was May's struggle to achieve Olympic records in downhill skiing. He seems to have dared so much more before he ""dared to see""."
2,Novel or screenplay?,"The writing is so excruciatingly deliberate and painful I read it as fast as possible to get it over with. The impression I got was the author believed the story would be a great film. Clichéd as they come, I was compelled to laugh when May's wife, after discussing the implications of the surgery ""...took May's hand. ""I believe in you, she said"" cheesy doesn't begin to cover it. If it weren't a true story it would have been 1 star."
2,Drudgery,"I really wanted to like this book, but Crashing Through turned into drudgery about half way through the story. The story is about Mike May, a blind man from a very young age, and his decision to have a surgery that allows him to see again. Mike's whole life is portrayed, and while it is interesting, it is not altogether fascinating. What is really compelling is what will happen to Mike after he has the surgery. Unfortunately, it is precisely at this moment that the book lost its appeal for me. The author quickly turns to describing the minutiae of May's daily life and what it's like to see ordinary things for the first time. After reading page after page of this, I finally gave up and stopped reading."
5,Best book I've read all year,"This is the best book I've read all year (and I read a lot). It's a well-told, fascinating, true story. I know what I'm getting everyone for Christmas this year."
5,Excellent writing,"Although it reads like a novel, this is a true story. It is so well written that the reader doesn't mind that the ""why"" of Mike May's failure to see as well as his eye should have after surgery was obvious to anyone who knew the first thing about education, the brain, early childhood, etc. We find Mr. May's excitment and exploration as fascinating as he does himself. This is a good read, and it has the advantage of being upbeat at a time we all need cheering."
4,Mike May - an Inspiration to Us All,"Having known Mike May for many years, I was intrigued to read Robert Kurson's interpretation of Mike's journey from blindness to sight. It is a huge credit to Mike that as he went through the many challenges, joys, and disappointments of regaining his vision, his day-to-day demeanor toward his friends and colleagues never changed. He was a marvelous blind man and he remains the same marvelous sighted person. His love of life never wavered. For him, sight was a new adventure that enhanced his life while also presenting new challenges, but his heart and soul and spirit were already intact so sight merely expanded his experience as did speed skiing, playing his guitar or fathering GPS development for blind people. Read this book and get to know one of the world's great human beings!"
5,A self help manual masked in a great adventure.,"I was truly riveted by the story of Mike May. Since I finished it, I've reflected on it more than a dozen times. Beyond the incredible story of this mans life, the message of challenging yourself to have a more fulfilling life is one I'll carry with me forever. The way Mike was raised, the way he's lived his life should be held up as an example for every man, woman and child. Life throws plenty of challenges to each of us, but this truly exceptional person took on a life altering, dangerous journey into an uncertain result - risking not only his slight light perception, but risking his very life.Thank you Robert Kurson for telling a captivating, compelling story about a one in a million person. You cannot read this book and not be inspired to go out and challenge yourself to achieve and do more. It's just a great story that helps put life in perspective."
4,A and J,"It must be horrible to begin life seeing and them to go blind. This book is not about feeling sorry for Mike but a way to feel someone's strength in achieving so much. Some of us who can see should look at life as Mike did. His Mother was so loving but also believed there was nothing her son could not do unless he tried. I did not give it a 5 star because I did not like all the medical terminology at the end. It was way over my head. I finished this book thinking, if I never try something, I will never know whether or not I can do it. Here's to more risk taking!"
1,Cheap plastic,"Gloves are cheap plastic. Although they are the right size, the thumb don't fit well. Compared to old school bag gloves, they suck. Someone's making a high profit off a brand name manufactured using low craftsmanship."
3,Deceptive Picture - Not as good as the old ones,"I just got these gloves and I was a little disappointed. The gloves are not the classic old ones with the red trim that have a steel bar through the palm, but new ones that really feel like cheap plastic and have a hard foam bar instead. With hand wraps they make for decent bag gloves, although they really look terrible. Performance wise they seem to work ok, hence the three starts, but the fit is really weird and I would look at these in store before you buy so you know what you are getting."
3,A pretty good series of short stories,"Each story has the theme of cloning embedded into it. The reader is treated to several authors writing a different short story following the ""clones"" theme! There's no point in doing plot summaries for a bunch of short stories, but let me point out the story written by Greg Egan, is not to be missed. It is dark, and very thought provoking, I was spooked out reading what happens in his story, because it really give you a different perspective on cloning that will rattle you! very good storytelling!"
1,Unnecessary - Let's Go is much better for low-low-budget,I haven't used this book while travelling; I merely read it to plan my trip. It is obvious to me that _Let's Go Europe_ is much better.
3,Buy another guide book instead,"I traveled around Europe in the fall of 1999 and purchased this book for the trip. I found out much of the information to be outdated and vague. It would say things like ""hostel is 1.5 miles southwest of the city"" but wouldnt say how to get there! Many critical street names to finding important tourist sites and hotels were omitted on the maps also. There has to be a better guide book out there."
1,This book was awful!!!,"I just received this book as a Valentine's gift from a co-worker and finally sat down to read it last night. The poetry is awful, the stories are mundane. I almost want to return this book to my friend so he can get his money back."
5,Cinderella Watch,"When a little girl I was given a Cinderella watch by Santa. A friend also had one as a child. Both of us, now in our 60's, decided we wanted one again. I found this one on Amazon which greatly resembled the one we had, and ordered one for both of us. It's perfect, and has brought back many wonderful memories. The quality is excellent. It fits an adult, and child."
2,pretty watch,Very pretty watch- given to my daughter for her 11th birthday. Fits nicely. The only thing I am not real happy about and wish I had done more research on is the fact that it is NOT water resistant. Would have made a different choice if I had realized that small detail.
1,Where's the gong?!?!,"I downloaded the MP3 version of Ocean because I wanted a way to time my yoga poses without having to look at a timer but there is no gong! I've listened to 20 minutes worth of it so far and all I here is crashing waves. I like the idea of it, but it does me no good if I can't hear some sort of indication as to when I'm supposed to change postures. This was a waste of money!"
1,Different products?,"The MP3 download of the 'Yoga Timer' CD with Ocean and Sunrise tracks has no clear marker of time. The two positive reviews say it's easy to hear the changing for them - one even mentioning a gong - which is not present in these tracks. It's lovely atmospheric music, but other than the waves crashing every 15 seconds - I listened trying to find a counter - there is no timer.I wonder if, perhaps, there are multiple CDs that are being confused?"
3,works as a timer,"I can hear the gongs so the songs work as a timer - sometimes I drift off with the wave sounds so I'm not paying attention but otherwise, it works for me."
5,The Great Game,A turn-based strategy game that mimics some of WWII's most significant encounters. Sadly it does not work on Windows 8.
1,My 65H8O is a lemon!,"I ordered a 65H80 in April. It worked two hours then lost the picture. The local Toshiba Service rep could not repair it and the advice he got from the main service office was misleading and incorrect. The instructions he received on CD were in Japanese and the diagrams did not apply to my version of the set.Then I was stonewalled with excuses from Toshiba since the tech and I reported it in June. Today is 100 days since I got the set and only now have I gotten an offer to replace the set, but now the model is no longer available as a new mmodel (65H81) is coming out.The service from Toshiba has been HORRID!! I cannot recommend Toshiba television products based on my experience with customer service alone."
1,Thief,"The man and his ""competitors"" were not above your common grave diggers. They simply dug and hauled treasures and historic artifacts out of their resting places and rubbed a people and the land of their heritage.Shame on those who consider them true archeologists."
5,JOIN THE GREEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"SOILENT GREEN HAS EXPLOSIVE RIFFS, TEMPO CHANGES, AND HARDCORE VOCALS, WITH MELODIC SOUNDS AND A VERY HARSH, ABRASIVE DRUM BLASTSS NOT FOR JUST ANY ONE, ONLY THOSE EXTREMESTS "" EXTEREME MUSIL FOR EXTREME PEOPLE"""
4,brutal,"I picked up this disc due to the recommendations of everyone whose heard Soilent Green. I popped this disc in and was greeted by the hell known as Hand Me Downs. Its like Pantera on steroids! Ill say now, this is not an easy listen at all. Ben Falgousts vocals jump from an evil screech, to gutteral growl, to a phil-like yell, while time changes jump around randomly in the Meshuggah vein. This is just 30 minuets of pure southern ... kicking. Best songs are Hand me Downs, A Grown Man, Swallowhole, Last One in the Noose, and She Cheated on You Twice."
3,soilent green,"a deleted sypmhony for the beaten down comes right out of the gate pretty brutal. i like this cd.the vocals range from a black metal screech to a death metal growl. musically the cd ranges from hardcore to death metal, and at certain points show a very definite nod to black sabbath(never a bad thing). they probably listen to a lot of grind as well. 'swallowhole' sort of reminds me of napalm death at certain points.a deleted symphony for the beaten down is a totally decent release. chances are, it will kick your ... so check it out of your into metal."
2,In a word ... Dry.,"This book will give you very interesting information regarding Elvis Costello and his musical career but it is dry and very English. The biggest downfall was each chapter follows the same format: history of the CD that year, stories of the songs on the CD and then reviews by pop and music magazines. Then on to the next CD, alas it leaves something to be desired. And the author's obsession with Bebe Buell begins to bore the reader as well."
2,Turns gold into base metal,"A missed opportunity - a lot of information, a lot of poor writing. Holds the interest due to the weight of collected research, but reads as unedited scrawl from an enthusiastic hobbyist. Strange that the brilliant songwriter should be treated with lumpish prose. Costello admirers are among the more literate consumers of popular culture. They will find the book both desirable for its information, and repellent for its style. Hinton's gifts seem to be in research rather than clear communication. He could learn a literary trick or three from his subject."
2,LET THE AUTHOR TALK...,"I've never been so aware of an author before. Usually, even in a biography, you can kind of lose yourself in the story. Not here. Apparently the writer is getting paid by the word, and the longer the better. Turn to any page and there are examples like: ""Sniffing glue and being sick had replaced rural weekends, tower blocks were suddenly more romantic than a bluebell wood, and anger and amphetamine seemed infinitely preferable to drifting away on a dope-fuelled reverie"" (Honestly, I didn't even look for this. I opened the book for an example and it is the first thing I saw!) It is a very annoying read that also concentrates too much on live performances and interviews in the press. I guess I'm still looking for a book about Elvis that concentrates on the SONGS - a book that is much more browsable than this one. Some decent anecdotal song information is here, but you have to suffer through so much garbage to get it that you should save the money and form your own opinions."
5,Perfect!,Eddie Conner has done a masterful job. I laughed as I learned and felt that I held in my hand the key to living a fulfilling life!
3,NEED INFO ON CD..,"I want information about this CD, then perhaps I would buy it, THEN I can give you my thoughts on how I would rate it. I rated it 3, but have never heard it and want to. Give me some info please. Thank you."
5,Fun Christmas music with a beautiful score!,"I originally bought this CD for Faith Hill's ""Where Are You Christmas"", but I fell in love with the score as well after hearing it! It is a wonderful score with a holiday feel to it, and I love it! All of the songs at the beginning of the albuim are fun, with a warm and cheery holiday feel to them as well. It was an audio version of the movie, in my opinion, which is truly the best Christmas movie of today!"
4,A whimsical holiday soundtrack,"I found this CD to be an enjoyable addition to my holiday collection. I enjoy the two groupings of songs, one with the popular artists, like Busta Rymes and Faith Hill; and the second with the tracks directly from the movie. Overall, nothing is particularly stellar, but the music is catchy and fun to listen to."
3,Disappointed in delivery,"The product is fine; however, I paid for expedited delivery and did not receive the item in time for use. I ordered on Nov 28 needing the CD for a dinner party on Dec 5. It did not arrive until Dec 7."
1,Definitely Not One for the Christmas Collection!,"First of all, there are only a couple of good songs on it, one of which is Barenaked Ladies singing ""Green Christmas"". Most of the songs are either mind-numbingly dull or simply poorly produced. I was also disappointed that the music was broken up with some of the movie's lame dialogue. I listened to this once -- and am saddened with the thought that it's an hour of my life I will never get back. Oh well!"
3,Entertaining,"James Horner did it again. He comes up with a song that I just can't get out of my head or hate for that matter despite whoever sings it, and that song is ""Where are You Christmas?"" sung by Faith Hill. I am definitely no fan of Faith Hill and never will be but this syrupy ballad has suckered me into buying the soundtrack alone.I absolutely hated the tracks by NSYNC, Isidore and the Inquisitors, and Smash Mouth. They just got on my nerves and I always skip them. The Ben Folds song wasn't too hot either. His voice is very flat. The dialogue from the movie was... unnecessary.""Grinch 2000"", ""Christmas is going to the dogs"" and ""Green Christmas"" are other favorite songs off the soundtrack. I was very surprised that I liked the Barenaked Ladies track since I find them rather annoying in general. Not being a hip hop fan, I also found myself shocked to like Busta Rhymes contribution to the soundtrack. Overall a cute cd but I've heard better soundtracks in the long run than this."
4,Special Jim Carey rap....,"Bought it for Faith Hill's song, but was great to hear all the different songs during the Christmas holiday season."
2,Only for James Horner fans!,This cd is one of the worst cds I've ever fully listened to. I only recommend it for people who collect the soundtracks of James Horner.
1,Dr Seuss must be spinning in his grave,"First Ron Howard takes a perfect 20-some minute cartoon and turns it into an hour and some minute vehicle for Jim Carrey to do a Cowardly Lion imitation in green-face. Then this soundtrack is released.....OK, the TransSiberian Orchestra sounds fine, and Faith Hill can sing the phone book......but there is NO excuse for the horrid ""Grinch 2000"" and the snippets of dialogue from the film are pointless.....the rest of the CD is filled with pointless pop and background music. Thankfully the soundtrack for the original cartoon is available, and if you really have a burning desire to find decent alternative versions, try ""You're A Mean One Mr Grinch"" on RuPaul's Xmas CD."
1,I don't like this movie at all.,I ask everone I know if they like this. To bad it could be a good movie. Go out and get the old one.
1,Did they actually Read the book?!,"There is not enough space for me to explain why this film(and soundtrack) are woefully inadequate of the name Dr. Seuss.The Fact that there are so many songs on the album screams commercialism(what the book was complaining about, wake up people!) and James Horner's score which has a couple of nice moments but doesn't have that Seussian sound. 'Where are you Christmas' is annoying beyond all reason and I mean both versions. And whose bright idea was it to have Jim Carrey mangle 'You're a Mean One'?If you're looking for a more Grinch like score, go find Elfman's Nightmare Before Christmas."
5,How the Grinch stole my heart,A fantastic compilation of songs and memorable moments from the movie that will make you laugh!
5,5 Stars!,"Thanks so much for getting me the book in New condition, just as described. I would recommend your services to anyone. Thanks for a great book and more importantly; Great Customer Service!Carpe Diem!JL"
4,"I'd trust a magazine Editor, and I like the book too","Margot Potter is the new Editor of Simply Beads magazine and I think I'd trust her reviews... there's a lot of cheap beading books on the market, just like there's cheap jewelry out there. Hip to Bead is beautifully designed and has very clear photography, often with many different shots of each project. I also like that she gives ideas for variations, because often when making jewelry you don't want to mimic the design exactly."
4,Cute and creative,"I like that there are so many different materials used in this book. Beginners can easily be inspired by the patterns you find here - there's a little bit of everything. I haven't actually made anything yet, but I love the antique button bracelet and the found object charm bracelet - really cute and quirky way to use vintage pieces. The instructions seem easy to follow, and there are good illustrations."
1,I'l rub your back and you rub mine,I see that Margot Potter has given a glowing review to this book. Check out her book and see Katie Hacker's glowing review. I can't buy either book now sight unseen as I don't trust the reviews.
2,Glow in the Dark Frisbee,It does not glow in the dark. Is there anything special that needs to be done to it so that it will glow??
1,Looks good but too light!!!,"The Ultra-Star 175G Ultimate Disc is supposed to be 175 grams. This is the regulation weight for an ultimate disc. It weighs only 170 grams, however. It's a good looking disc, if that is what you are going for. Otherwise, I would be hesitant to putchase any Ultra-Star disc."
5,I'd use this frisbee over any other brand.,These frisbees fly farther and work better than all other frisbees. They are used and accepted by the national ultimate frisbee league.
5,Fantastic product,I grabbed one of these for some good summer play at a conference recently and it turned out to be the hit of recreation sessions. Lots of good feedback on feel and handling and nice colors too. Great value.
5,Christmas present for 16yr old,This is a Christmas present for my 16 year old son who plays Ultimate Frisbee. He prefers Discraft to other manufacturers. It is competition weight. Color is good.
5,New frisbee,"I'm teaching my young daughters the thrill of throwing frisbee. This disk is ultra sturdy, unlike the Wham-O disk. Our Wham-O disk broke while I was trying to show the girls how to do some tricks. Wham-O disks are junk. I will always stay with Discraft frisbees from now on.I wanted a heavy disc to teach them the right way to throw frisbee."
4,Very nice disc though plastic is surprisingly soft,"First time I bought one of these and it is very nice. It flies very well and feels very good in the hand. My entire family enjoys it as well after multiple trips to the beach & camping with it. Though the plastic itself is easily scored and sliced into, reflecting missed catches and even a fingernail gouge or two. Unsure if that is an issue or just a side effect of the weight and plastic composition to achieve it or that it sat in the sun in it's box outside for a few hours before I got home and cooled it down. The transaction was smooth and painless with good shipping."
4,"glow in the dark, very short","I was hoping to get a glow in the dark that would last a little bit of time, so you know, it could be useable in some way at night.The glow charges up in only a few minutes under the light, and then discharges just as quickly in the dark. Literally, a couple of minutes. After the discharge, there is still a faint glow that lasts about half an hour.This is probably just what glow and the dark is, so I can't complain. It just doesn't seem that useful on a frisbee/ultimate disk. It might be cool on a field with only partial lighting..."
2,The disc wasn't completely level.,"Of course the design is awesome, and a frisbee is awesome, but I was a little disappointed when this arrived. The moment I got it, I noticed that when sat on a flat surface, it would tilt side to side. It also slightly wobbles when throwing. It isn't so bad that it is unusable; however, I expected perfection when I pitched out an extra $4 or so for the cool design. I've had 2 other Discraft frisbees and they've been perfect, but it just so happens that the cool one is the most flawed... Sad day."
4,Good Frisbee,This frisbee is good for random games at work and on the weekends.It is also a nice color.
2,not so good,"Hard to throw. Tend to wobble once air borne and doesn't fly far. Not much fun to play with, It seems a poor design because the air lift force doesn't support its own weight well enough."
4,Cute and fun frisbee,"Bought this for my husband to help him relive his earlier college days where he spent a lot of time playing frisbee. We take it to a nearby field and play a few days a week.For a plastic disc, this one is great. Just the right weight for casual play, and easy enough for people of all ages to enjoy. The purple color change is a fun feature, and I sure love the chameleon design on the top.Shipping was fast and we are satisfied with the purchase!"
5,Amazing disc,"This is the best disc I have used to date. The balance and feel is perfect. Flies very smoothly, and the edges aren't too hard like some ultimate discs are. Top rate. Highly recommended."
5,as expected,"product was as i expected. good for beginers, yet got the pro-look and finish. took me a couple of days to get used to the size because i was using a smaller disc before, probably explains why i wasnt able to throw as far with this disc. also has a decent hang-time. would buy again"
4,Bought these for my lab,He still chews thru them--just not as fast. These are heavier and larger than the cheap ones I get a Walmart.
2,doesn't fly flat like my older disc,i use frisbees to play with my dogs. my old one flies flat and true. i've bought 2 at wally world and this one from amazon that fly flat for a few feet and make a sharp right turn and my dogs can't keep up with them.
4,The fluorescent isn't exactly the same feeling,"It's the well-known Discraft official Ultimate disc, but I bought the cheapest one, which is the fluorescent one, and the material is a bit different compared to the original one I'm used to, the touch is a bit different and it appears softer."
4,"Good disc, but...","I bought the glow in the dark disc. It flies great, but doesn't hold it's glow for very long. For maybe two minutes, it is very bright, depending on how close in porximity it was to the light. After 2 minutes, it loses its light FAST. Bring a flashlight outside with you for a quick recharge."
4,Best Frisbee I have owned,"You are never too old to keep haveing fun. My girlfriend and I like to take my dog out and play in the park. He loves to catch the frisbee but he doesnt always bring it back.This is the best and only really good frisbee I have ever owned. It has a really nice balance and a lot of bulk so you can get a lot of momentum, speed, and stability with it."
3,"Great Product, Wrong Shipment",The discraft frisbees are by far the greatest frisbees you can order. I use it for everything from Ultimate to Frisbee Golf. It flies straighter and is more durable than other frisbees I've owned. However the frisbee pictured was NOT the one I received. I got the dark bluish-one instead of the vibrant blue sparkled one. However they quickly just gave me the price difference. It really wasn't a big deal b/c discrafts are great products!
4,fun!,this was a fun thing to buy... I dont play ulitmate frisbee but still this is good for the park or the beach!its really durable and fun to play with
1,crap,"disc is horrible, I received it and was lob-sided. Poor quality, I wouldn't recommend this company. Buy from someone more reputable"
5,Flies like a dream!,I won't buy any other disc from now on. Flies true and doesn't get bent up real easily.
4,Good Frisbee,"This is a good product to use from a quick,random game at work to playing on the weekend."
5,Great Disc,"I am a weekly Ultimate Player currently Stuck in the Desert. Used the disc for the first time last week during our weekly game and it was fantastic. Not only did it maintain level flight really well it also held up very well in pretty high winds, and seemed to correct my over released throws as well."
2,Starscape pic is misleading,"What can I say about a frisbee? The ""starscape"" color looks great in the picture, but it's just a cheap cover on a white frisbee. The pattern isn't even as big as the whole frisbee, and the underside is just plain white. See my pic."
3,Good service,The service was fast. When used this frisbee scratched and dented easily. Somewhat disappointed in the product. I expected more.
3,ultimate frisbee,This is my sons He is on an ultimate frisbee team at school. This is the second one i have bought. It doesn't stay in compition condition long
4,"Good, flies straight.","IT's a great disc, perhaps I'm just used to lesser discs but I like to be able to curve my throws, which is very hard to do with this product."
5,"Just right, for the price","The discs that we ordered were just right for the price. They were priced way below any other discs that we researched. They are the ""legal"" discs (according to size and weight) used in the game of ultimate frisbee. I recommend these frisbees."
5,the legacy continues,"Oh yes my brethren and sistren the legacy of truly HEAVY fuzz chunk drug brute metal/hardcore is still lurching forth.This wonderful piece of art is a shining example of that.These fellows have maintained,without staleness,the power which began with Sabbath.Mid to slow tempo bluesy doom sludge metal.I can't believe they're not southern!Sleep,Buzzov-en(R.I.P.),Eyehategod,Grief,Neurosis,High on Fire,Sons of Otis,Earth,Cathedral,Jesuseater,Melvins(early works anyway)and the like are called to mind when listening.All comparisons are complimentary of course.This is top shelf stuff here folks.Except for the fact that its so heavy once you got it to the top shelf it would crush the whole thing.Massive sound on this one.Big,thick,huge behemoth sound.Thick and dark as the resin which has brought this masterpiece of the genre forth..."
5,Wonder why the relationship of your dreams didn't work out?,"Here's the book to help figure you out.Thanks to a friend who made me very angry by sending me this unannounced, I'm closer now to realizing why I always walk away from relationships & haven't found ""Mr. Right"" yet. Or when I do find them, why all the Mr. Right's walk away from me.If you think you're fine but can't figure out why you don't have a good relationship with a healthy person, this book is for you. Read it over and over and absorb it and eventually the denial will wear off and you'll realize that maybe it's YOU.Easy to read with lots of stories, but difficult to pinpoint yourself at first, you'll find this book best for reading when someone you want walks away from you...especially if you're the one used to walking away!Read this especially if you think you have no problems with commitment. It's the book that just may turn your relationships around, but only if you're willing to apply the good advice in it."
1,A Frustrating Read In a Time of Distress,"I will echo the thoughts of the other readers who found this book to be a disappointment.Most noticeable to me was the amateurish tone and style of writing:The authors use 1000 words to say what could be said in under a hundred. It is this type of belabored point-making that is very unsettling to a distressed person in need of comfort and answers. It was like a chatty housewife telling me about her kid's tonsillectomy while I lay bleeding waiting for an ambulance. Very distressing.The authors also imply a tone of condemnation to those who do not have significant commitments in life (a mortgage, a long-term job, etc.) yet never pinpoint factors in the commitment phobe's life as to why commitment is frightening to them and how the fear can be overcome.However, the authors DID succeed at sighting cases of commitment phobia -- over and over and over. Heh."
2,Wrtten by non-experts,"While the writers do a good job of presenting their views, they cannot make up for the fact that they are not experts in this field and have no real knowledge of what they are talking about.They blame EVERYTHING on someone not being up for commitment. There are many complex reasons why a relationship doesn't work out or people don't connect. It isn't always a ""commitment-phobic"" issue.An expert would tease out these differences and present us with information we can use. Instead, the authors present this one theory, and write an entire book based on their wanna-be views.2 stars for this novel. I call it a novel because it is one. It is pure fantasy."
1,Rambling,I was not impressed with this book. I found the information to be rambling and the examples did not particularly support the conclusions they were paired with. I have read quite a few relationship books lately and this was one of my least favorite. It seemed primarily like an apology for blaming men for all the relationship problems in their first book so they were trying to even the score. Not recommended.
3,Too many examples,"I felt this book was mostly instances of other people's problems with relationships and not enough, how to deal with your own. The writers seem amateur really."
5,Highly Recommended!,"As a psychotherapist, I find myself talking about this book on a weekly basis. It is important for people to understand that committment phobia is a real syndrome that can be overcome. The expert guidance of these authors offer gives people insight AND the confidence to grow."
5,A Commitment Phobics Dream Read!,"After my disappointing experience with Eat, Pray, Love I was eager to move to a world of non-fiction where I could proactively learn about my issues and possibly even learn something that would allow me to work through them! I will admit I am only 75% done, but thus far I am feeling like this book will really make a difference in my future dating career."
5,Bullseye,"SPOT ON! This book sculpted out the last one and a half years of my life with laser-like precision. I read it in one sitting, and it has thoroughly fortified my spirits with guidance that I'm glad to know is the result of the authors' experience with countless other cases similar to mine."
4,"it begins with a step, and for me this was it","like one reviewer said, it's not the book to fix the house, but I found it helpful to show me where I've possibly gone wrong. There's a deeper problem though at work, and it's societal. Our culture suffers from speed dating and instant gratification. and Commitment and a desire to risk sustained effort seems lacking out there, even in myself. I know, it's tough, when you've been hurt, but it's part of a larger epidemic, and things won't change until we start.. this book in my estimation, and for me, was a good start.. and I can recommend it for that.. but please don't finish there.. we've got to sort through the muddle, and our own bitterness, heartache, apathy, etc.... and most of all be willing to make more mistakes and have understanding.. of ourselves and others.."
3,a good case against relationships,This book was very helpful in identifying patterns that I've seen in just ended and past relationships. Also made me realize where I might be passively making choices in partners knowing that there could be no future. They explained the reasons why commitmentphobes fear relationships so well that I became convinced that relationships are really not desirable.
4,Great read,"I got this title from the SETI website, and was quite pleased (so much so that I bought another one they recommended). This is a great book. I finished it in two days - it is hard to put down. It is fairly light on the science. If you're looking for a detailed description of the science behind life (necessary conditions for a planet, etc.), this is not it. However, it gives a great description of the search for alien signals. The discussion of how human intelligence has maxed out is by itself worth the purchase price. This one is a fun read that won't strain your brain. Buy it!"
1,Superficial and trivial,"I read this book hoping that the glib one-liners and poor in-jokes would give way to something substantial but they never did. It's written in such a trivial and superficial style that makes one think all the time whilst reading it ""where's the beef?"" It's full of cliches and what the authors obviously thinks is funny but it really is an unsatisfactory read.The publishers should have worked on the text more as it is obvious that the author cannot write in other than soundbytes in what I would call a type of division four Saganesque. The author obviously thinks he is an authority on the subject of life in space but only displays a superficial and incomplete grasp of the field.My advice is to get anything by Sagan instead. It's obvious that Shostak regards himself as a kind of successor to Sagan however I have news for him...."
1,it's a BAR not little discs like I expected,"The pizza cheese was a bar with a burnt taste at the core, and a VERY hard texture which made me worry about breaking a tooth. I will not be ordering this again. The white cheddar flavor which came as expected in the little discs is much tastier and easier to bite."
4,Beware of Problem !!!,"I just wanted to mention that there could be a little problem to get beyond chapter 5.4. There seems to be a problem with this DVD that renders a complete VOB file (1gig) unusable for any DVD-Player (any I have seen so far). But I managed to view it anyway (ever heard of dod-speedripper... illegal, but working).FOR DUMMIES : 1/4 of the 2nd DVD is unreadable.... I hope that the producer has discovered this mistake.And now for the Movie : It's really worth buying, a great epic adventure with a little fantasy."
1,Homo Drag Queen Fury,"If you love ham-slamming goodness - buy this movie. It sucks so bad, I walked away while it was playing. The super-gay prince, homo-erotic subtext and men that look like girls (and dress as them too).... oh boy! And the trashy english accents didn't help either. The single female lead brings new meaning to Amazon....and I don't mean the wonderwoman kind. The art was horrible, bland and filled with colored-over photos of scenery. The bad guy is Darth Vader with a skin rash...it just sucked..."
2,Very Disappointing,"This movie starts out awesome, and definetly resembles Record of Lodoss. Great Story, great characters, but the ending was so disappointing that I asked for my money back. If you love a good ending this movie is not for you. Rent it if you can."
4,Mixed feelings.,"I had wanted to see The Heroic Legend of Prince Arislan/Arslan for a long time after seeing the trailers. The animation is simply presented (often the backgrounds are simplified or non-existant) while still beautiful. The character design is lovely, although admittedly they lack any serious depth -- probably because the cast is so large. The sudden decisions to change not only the spelling of all proper nouns but all of the voice casting for the last parts were tragic and pointless ones. The American voice cast stinks in comparison to the British casting of earlier parts. As a classic and enjoyable piece of anime, it's still worth having, but be wary of a disappointing finale for the reasons above, and lack of closure."
3,too bad it's incomplete,"This anime really had potential. Too bad the movie isn't complete (seems they didn't finish the whole thing). At certain points in the movie, they even kept on introducing more and more characters - almost pointless. Makes you wonder why some characters should even be in the movie. Dubbing and actual names seemed off-sync. I'm still not sure if its Prince Arislan or Arslan, is it Gieves or Gihbu, is it Lusitanians or Rusitanians? I suggest you rent this title first. For a better yet somewhat similar movie, go for Lodoss Wars."
3,Z z z z z z z z,"I could only make it to the beginning of Part 3 before I fell asleep. I really *wanted* to like Heroic Legend of Arslan, but it just didn't do it for me. The animation is very simple, there's little or no character development, and nothing important or exciting ever really seems to happen. I *did* like the Persian look to the whole thing, and some of the music was pleasant enough. I'm sure Arslan will be entertaining enough for some people, but I was pretty well bored by the end of Part One."
2,"Ending hanging, very disappointing.","Fortunately I rented this title, I didn't buy it. The ending was left hanging after the return of Androgoras in Disc B. What happened next is left to your own imagination. Is there a third disc? Or did the writers just felt tired of the story and gave up?"
3,Something's missing!,"No offense to the voice over actors, but why is a lower class voice dubbing Prince Arslan. I happen to have British relatives, and it was very distracting to hear Arslan speak with what is considered to be oa low class accent in Great Britan. He's a prince right? Oh well.The animation was great and a few of the battle sequences were also nice, but there still seems to be something missing from the film. An ending might be part of it. But I also seemed to sense a lack of comradery. The Lodoss War characters had a better sense of friendship.If you like epic medieval animes, this film might be right for you. It just was'nt for me. I still gave it 3 stars. It might have been 4 if it wer'nt for Arslan's voice."
4,HEROIC LEGEND OF ARISLAN PART 1,"THIS IS THE BEST PART OF THE ARISLAN VIDEOS. THE ART AND STORY ARE AWESOME. IT TELLS OF HOW THE PALSION ARMY WAS DEFEATED BY THE EVIL LUCUTANIONS. YOU GET A GREAT INTODUCTION TO THE CHARETERS THAT PLAY A MOJOR PART IN THE SERIES. IF YOU LIKE THIS MOVIE TRY THE OTHER 5 PARTS TO THE SERIES. (part 2, 3and4,age of heroes.)"
5,Licorice Tea,This is a wonderful tea. So soothing. Great for that afternoon pick me up. Great taste and good for you. Licorice mint is a great flavor and so healthy.
5,My favorite tea,"This is delicious, naturally sweetened tea w/ stevia, and great to get it at this price vs. $5/pop at Whole Foods."
4,Tasty New Favorite,"Yogi Tea has introduced a winner in Egyptian Licorice Mint. It's the perfect after dinner herbal tea. It doesn't have a strong licorice or mint flavor, but instead a delightful synthesis. I feel like it's easy on my tummy and doesn't need food to complement it. What more could you ask for?"
3,Not really balanced,I love the licorice tea so I thought I would love this too. But the mint is too strong and you don't really get the licorice flavor. I'll stick to the Egyptian Licorice instead.
3,Sugar Maple Leaf Cookie Cutter,I bought this cookie cutter to make cookies for my son's Maple Leaf hockey team. I was a little disappointed because it was smaller than i had anticipated -- especially because it cost so much for shipping.
2,script full of silliness,"The script of ""Helen of Troy"" is so full of improbable silliness and stilted dialogue it is matched only by the wooden acting that in the 50s seemed a requirement of Hollywood epics. In the end it spoils the spectacular sets and occasionally effective cinematography. The sack of Troy sequence at the end of the movie almost redeems it, and I am almost tempted to raise my rating for that alone. But then I remember the hash they made of the actual seige, with medieval seige engines and uninspired choreography. Paris is played as a 50's hunk who completely upstages Hector. There's no hint of the spoiled, self-indulgent womanizer. Worse, the romance between him and Helen fell a little flat. It's worth having a look at if you are a fan of this genre, as I am, but otherwise it disappoints."
3,No Ten Commandments,Recommended to me by a friend it is a would be spectacular that didn't quite make it. Pageantry for sure but the story leaves a lot to be desired.
1,Be sure to check Regions...this one is NOT for Region 1,"I've seen the film, loved it as a kid. So, this review is NOT for the film. Rather a caution for those of you looking for the DVD. Check out the other one here on Amazon which is for Region 1. This particular DVD, which I purchased, is definitely for an Asian audience and respective audio-vid gear. My bad...can't blame anyone, I did not read it carefully enough. Just an FYI. Thanks"
3,Wish list,These classic movies are work of art. I wish somebody inform film studios to develop DVD version of these movies.
3,Not Ben-Hur but not Bad,"This movie seemed a little ""rushed"" to me. Lots of story crammed into 2 hrs. Melodramatic it is, with lots of angst in the love department. The effects and battle scenes make it watchable. This movis is ok if you want an epic but do not have time to watch Ben-Hur or Cleopatra."
4,Star-crossed lovers and epic battles,"This rendition of the story of Troy was probably, like last years's miniseries, brought out because of the recent release of Brad Pitt in ""Troy"". However, this film can well stand on its own with a literal cast of thousands, grand sets, beautifully done action scenes both large and small, and a very good cast of mostly British/European actors. Stanley Baker and Harry Andrews stand out above the rest as Achilles and Hector and they both do well in their single combat scene towards the end of the picture. Rosana Podesta does look like an Aphrodite clone and is far more appealing, in my eyes, than the actress who was in the recent miniseries. Admittedly there is some overacting--especially by Sir Cedric--but these were part of the acting style when the film was made. The first battle between the Trojans and the Greeks is worth the price of the disc---which is pristine and beautiful as only Warnercolor could be!"
5,Helen of Troy,"Although this is an ""older"" version of the story, it truly sticks to the original mythology better than some of the newer versions such as Troy with Brad Pitt."
5,Jack Sernas whom you may have never seen,"Jacques Sernas was featured in LA DOLCE VITA. His looks stood out as he was very handsome. I saw him in person in Hollywood at a fund raiser for the widow of the owner of the Mocambo. Frank Sinatra was performing that night.Jack was with his wife?Anyway, I had missed the theatrical run of HELEN OF TROY. Rossana Podesta was the female lead and Brigitte Bardot had a small part in the beginning.This was made in the '50's or '60's. It cannot compare with the new TROY starring Brad Pitt. But the actions scenes are spectacular. No computerized imaging (CGI) in those days. Real cast members and hundreds in the battle scenes. Jack is extremely handsome as is beautiful Rossana.It is truly a collectible DVD and one you can watch over and over. Beautiful transfer. I bought it on Amazon too. Doubtful if this is in any rental store."
2,Very Forgettable,"I have several other TRAX compilations in my House music collection. However this CD is quite forgettable. Nothing you could dance to, just bad music."
2,"Sadly, this IS the most complete published guide...","Overstreet is the bible for collectors of comic books; a sad fact, considering how lopsided its representation of comic book publishers is. I accept that not everything printed can be represented in a guide, but from the look of Overstreet, everything from either Marvel or DC can be- even a recent Marvel title which had poor sales and remains in low demand is represented here at its original cover price, but where are the independent titles which have enjoyed a substantial share of the same market? Where is the Gold Digger, for example, whose sales held strong even during the B&W bust, and which remains in demand today? It's not a bad guide, really... but for the $22 US cover price, I expect something more thorough."
1,Midland 75515xlbpr - a bad buy,"I purchased this product not in small part due to the positive reviews I read. LUCKY THEM!!! There was unacceptable distortion on one of the units in the set. A quick replacement was forthcoming from Amazonwhich worked well. Than the other original unit acted up. And another replacement was quickly sent by Amazon. Defective buttons!! So, at this point, I have one radio that works well and one radio that works fair. I suggest you look elsewhere if you want something of quality!"
5,Works Great,"I got this thing for when my friends and I play paintball, so that we could communicate with each other. Lets just say that these worked better than expected.Some of my other friends have Cobra's and Motorola's and I think that these (my radios) came with better features and sounded clearer.Definitely a good buy."
3,Maglite brand luxeon,I bought the Maglite brand luxeon for $18.98 AT HOME DEPOT. Very satisfied with the product and alot cheaper than $30. I got one for a 3 cell and a second one for a 2 cell I use at work.
3,"Not bad, but hoped for better quality stand.",I absolutely loved the design of this and therefore I spent a little more than what I planned for. I am very happy with the stoneware bowl and other accessories but thought the black metal stand would be of better quality. It is really thin and a little flimsy looking.
1,"Um, since when do lions float?","I really wanted to like the Baby Einstein stuff, but I just don't. The illustrations in this book are cute, but it's pretty darn boring, plus I hate that it is so not accurate in how it presents animals. How the heck do I explain why a baby lion is floating in a pool ring alongside his mum, the cat and dog are canoeing, and later on the lion family are in a ship. WHAT is with the lions? Lions have absolutely nothing to do with lakes, rivers or oceans. There is a place for silly placement of characters, but not in a book which claims to be about what floats. Lions don't float!I prefer 'Who lives in the pond', which is at least more educational and correct.That said, I think I will be chucking out our Baby Einstein bath books since I don't trust that the company uses safe materials."
1,Don't buy this book! (And throw it away if you own it!),"This book is made from PVC (vinyl), and according to a recent article in Parents magazine (July 2005), ""vinyl contains chemicals that can put kids at risk of developing asthma, cancer, and organ damage."" ""The European Union, as well as Canada, Mexico, and Argentina have banned the use of PVC in children's teething and sucking products"" -- and if your child is like mine, this book will become a sucking product. Although ""[m]ost major baby companies in the U.S. have dicontinued using vinyl in their infant-oriented toys,"" Baby Einstein has not. I recommend emailing Baby Einstein (...) and encouraging them to stop using PVC in baby products."
2,"Great idea, flawed in practice","This is a great idea--a floating book that a baby can gnaw on, bring to the bath, and so on. The problem is that the seam all along the edge of the book is quite sharp, so that whenever our little one would try to mouth it, his face would get scratched up. I'm also a little worried about what would happen if he caught the edge in his eye, so there is no way that we would let him play with it unsupervised. All in all, this is too much of a concern for me to recommend this product. It says ""newborns and up""--I don't think this is a good toy for a newborn."
2,Better for two year olds,"This book is rated from birth up, but the text and drawings are not interesting to babies or toddlers plus the edges are sort of sharp. This is a great book for two years and up, a bad book for babies."
2,"Great Story, Terrible Materials","When we first got this story as a gift from my mother, we were delighted and our son loved it. Then we looked at the back and saw it was made with the toxic chemical PVC and immediately took it away from him.We would give it away so another child can enjoy it, but we won't bear the moral responsibility of letting other children gnaw on this toxic book. The recycling centers won't take it, so I'm going to throw it away."
1,"Look out, made out of PVC",I really thought this book was cute--until I noticed it's made from poisionus PVC! I cannot believe Baby Einstein is still selling this book.
2,"Jane Grey Swisshelm; An Unconventional Life, 1815-1884 Review",I found the book interesting however I grew tired of the writer continuously pointing out that despite her amazing courageand perseverance Jane Grey Swisshelm was extreme and rather manic in her desires for change. The contemporary voiceof the author seemed to want to paint the subject as a bit of a crazy woman despite all of her achievements.She was definitely a woman ahead of her time in my opinion and this is not portrayed in the majority of this book.
1,not 4 mac,does not work right as an external drive connected to macbook pro via firewire. tried to burn no go. tried to rip- no go.
2,Scratched my toilet's porcelain,"While it did remove some ring staining, it did end up scratching my toilet's porcelain. I probably won't ever use it again as I'll be nervous that it will create more scratches in the porcelain."
4,Just so you know...,"...there is a paperback edition of this, but the title has changed to ""X-Treme Latin: All the Latin You Need to Know for Survival in the 21st Century."" The paperback edition came out in 2005 and seems to be the same material, although there could conceivably be some corrections or additions to the text."
1,Throw it in the trash,"This book is nothing like the two previous books, ""Latin for All Occasions"" and ""Latin for Even More Occasions"". They were witty and actually useful. Who wouldn't enjoy saying ""Nullo modo!"" (No way!) to their kids? But the language and humor in this book is what you would expect of a bunch of gutter-mouthed college jocks. Don't know which is worse, that someone wrote it or that someone actually edited and published this crap. Some things should simply not be said. Apart from one or two funny sayings, the best thing in the book is the guide to pronunciation."
2,X-Tremely Vulgar,There are a few good translations of modern phrases and a few clever inventions. But they are vastly outnumbered by hordes of pseudo-clever contrivances and just plain disgusting verbage.
1,Don't bother,"I was sorry I bought this book the minute I opened it. Henry Beard's other two Latin books (""Latin for All Occasions"" and ""Latin for Even More Occasions"") were hilarious, but this one was a real disappointment. It's mostly just a lot of profanity translated into Latin...waaaaaay too much profanity. Maybe you'd enjoy it if you like off-color humor, but I just found it to be offensive and obnoxious. I recommend Beard's other two books, but don't bother with this one. My copy is headed for the county landfill."
5,If only my Latin classes had been this much fun.,"I had no intentions of buying this book until I flipped through a few pages and saw too many funny things that seemed to make up for five painful semesters. Besides, I do love some good raunchy humor sometimes, and this is raunch for the way too educated part of my brain."
4,Good for oily skin,"This product really helped clear up my skin (oil and acne - specifically in the T-zone) - it feels extremely light-weight when you apply it, and at first I was skeptical that it would provide any kind of moisturizing at all, but it's surprisingly efficacious and long-lasting. I can only use it in the humid summer months when I struggle with oil and breakouts though, it's not for people with normal/dry skin and acne problems (it's a shame Dermatologica doesn't have a range for this population subsection). I found the face-wash (medibac) to be too harsh, especially along with the moisturizer (all of the products contain salicylic acid, which I find to be excessive) - I would recommend a gentle cleanser to use along with this product."
5,Very good product,"This product is great, it does control oil especially when used under make-up. I'd recommend it to anyone that have acne problems and oily skin."
1,Made things worse,This product made my skin oily and I broke out everywhere. This is not the only product I've used by Dermalogica specifically formulated for oily skin that has the opposite effect on me than for what it is intended. I will stick to Active Moist.
2,Doesn't Do Anything,"I used this product for about 7 months. When I ran out recently it took me awhile to order some more. I haven't been using this product for about three weeks now and my skin is no different (actually it might be looking a bit better). I have combination skin and am prone to brake outs on my chin with some minor blemishes on my cheeks from time to time. This lotion has salicylic acid in it which is supposed to be good for acne prone skin. My breakouts never improved while using this product and now that I've discontinued using it, I haven't noticed any difference except that my skin actually seems to be looking clearer. Needless to say, I won't be restocking this item in my medicine cabinet since I never saw an improvement in my skin while using it. I'm still using Active Moist as my general facial moisturizer."
4,Great Product!!,"I can go the entire day w/o blotting my face b/c of this product! I am also acne-prone, but it doesn't make me break out at all. There is a little bit of salicylic acid in it, so that is probably why. I have noticed that the acid does dry my skin out a little bit, but not to the point where my skin is flaky and I can't apply make-up."
5,why I like this product,"I like this product due to the grafics and the cars. If you like the oldies like I do then you may like the music too.I would recomend it to almost anyone, especially if you like the driver games."
3,All Right....,"At first, it's really cool, but after you beat the game it's really BORING!! At least it's less mature than GTA, but in the later part, TK starts to swear more. Parents, turn off sound fx and subtitles, then it's better for kids.Pros-No sexLess swearing than GTANo goreA lot less blood than GTACar customizationTwo erasCons-Boring after the game is completeMore swearing in the later part of the gamePedestrian swear a lotAlso, you CAN see your health, it's on the top-right corner. You also can change the format to fullscreen."
4,Great Game.,"This game is really fun. The graphics aren't so hot,and there can be glitches at times, but it has a great storyline and even greater gameplay.In this game you can shoot while driving,and you can customize cars.What I liked about this game is that if you become wanted while driving,if you ditch your car while out of sight you'll become anonymous.Overall, its a great game."
2,"Too easy, too short...","This game is FAR too easy, and FAR too short.The driving aspect is pretty good, with nice crash sequences.The on-foot aspect totally sucks, the aiming aspect totally sucks, when the guys run, it looks gay...But like I said, this game is far too easy and short, just when you think it's gonna get good, it's over.I bought this game June 2nd, and here it is June 19th, and I've already beaten it, come on Atari, make it a challenge.Bottom line, rent this game, don't buy it, save your money, I feel ripped off!...San Andreas this is NOT!"
1,This Game The Dumbest Game Ever,This game is so stupid terrible even.The driving part of the game terrible story lines terrible.Everything about this game is terrible.They try to copy grand theft auto 1.2 and 3 but no way.Please if you thinking of buying it DONT STOP way did i buy it 39.99 down the drain.Thats why its 39.99
4,Not too shabby!,"This game is pretty cool. The cars are cool, the missions are fun, the driving is fun, and the variety of cars and customization options is good as well. Car sounds are fairly good but not great yet. They should have allowed your character to jump and swim and they also should have included boats in the game. Driving missions are a blast but just cruising around in a boat is a nice break from the driving and lets you explore....but PL does not have this unlike D3 which does have it. but the graphics are better in PL though. D3 had that Miami Vice feel to it, but PL feels like it's original roots...pure driving fun. At least they have trucks and such in PL which is a plus. Free roam is now a part of the game and it allows you to roam freely until you choose and drive to your next mission. So you can tease cops all day between missions if you like. Get too much heat and they send copters and swat after you! lol If you are a Driver fan, then I recommend this game to you."
2,Truly horrible,"This game simply fails to offer the richness of play of the GTA series. In Driver, the buildings are simply scenery to drive around; boxes painted with textures. Add to that some very dodgy vehicle handling and traffic that edges around dumbly at snail speeds, and you have a major problem suspending disbelief and getting into the game. I got bored with it about half way through and gave up."
2,not well written,"This book, although apparently containing everything, is written in a very opaque style which makes it impossible to simply read through. It probably is a good reference to look in for particular topics, but it is not at all usable as an introduction."
4,first print,The book I bought is first printing version. Lots of typo inside..... I should correct them myself.-:(
5,I Am Bruce Lee [Blu-ray],"I enjoyed watching watching dvd I Am Bruce Lee [Blu-ray].It brought backmany memories of watching and remembering the greatest martial artist ofall time .Watching Bruce do his tryout for the part of Kato inthe Green Hornetto some of his moments on film. Bruce had lightning quick movements to hisgreat balance of a cat. Having his fomer wife Linda and his daughter give their input was very helpful also.Ther were other people who also gave their opinion and insight to Bruce Lee.I would highly recommend purchasing this dvd.I would like to thank Amazon for sending me dvd. Keep up the good work.Sincerly,Terry T."
4,"best documentary compilation of bruce lee's life, career and philosophy","If you have ever been facinated by the phenomenon of Bruce Lee, this is a must see dvd! His life, rise to stardom and road to legend."
5,Best Value in Big Screen!,This television has all the features that more expensive big screens have but costs a lot less! It comes with a protective screen which is great if you have small children! The picture is incredible and the smart sound keeps the volume at an even level. Great TV!
3,OTC 7889,Looks okay didn't need it after I bought it.This tool is included in the KDS41620 steering wheel service kit
3,Doesn't take much punishment,"I bought one of these, got it mounted, no trouble. I enjoy every minute of working out with the equipment. However, the platform is made of particle board - mine broke in half this morning after about 3 weeks of use. So if you're like me and tend to lay into your speed bag, be prepared to replace the platform with a piece of solid wood."
4,"A Great Starter Kit, but needs a few upgrades","This is a great value for the beginning boxer in your house. My only suggestion would be to upgrade the swivel that it comes packaged with. The one that's included is the most basic plastic swivel you can buy and after a few rounds of hitting the bag it would come unscrewed and end up getting punched across the room. I purchased the next step up in Everlast swivels for about $20 and the difference was instantly noticeable. Faster rebounds and a much more secure mount. You may also want to upgrade to a smaller bag after you get used to the one packaged with this kit. Oh, and one more thing, the kit comes with no lag bolts to mount it to a wall. I picked up 4 from the local hardware store for a few dollars, but I was surprised they weren't included like they were with the Everlast heavybag I also bought.For everything you get in this kit, it is well worth the money and a great way to get started in boxing for a good workout or competitive sport."
3,Bought it as a gift,"I can't vouch for anything about assembling or using this item. But, when I checked the order to see if it was correct, the bag that was supposed to be black leather was instead a weird rubbery red bag. I thought I was paying this high price because there was a leather one included. I contacted Amazon and they were extremely helpful: Told me to send it back in and they'd send another one express shipping. I received the other one, and it turned out to be the same type of bag. So, I haven't checked the page to see if it has changed, but I wanted to let people know what they are going to be ordering if they decide to buy this product."
4,Not bad for the price.,"I bought this setup a year ago and it has stood up to the test of time. the long screw that holds the hook for the bag can unscrew during prolonged beatings so i just dabbed some super glue on there, screwed it back in and the problem was completely fixed. Inexperienced users may hit the bag wrong causing it to fly off of the hook but after a couple days of punching the user will get their rhythm. A year ago this setup was 50 bucks, i guess its still not so bad a price at 60 something. The frame lines up to the studs in your wall so its solid. I just used four 16 penny nails to secure it to the wall, that worked fine. The kit comes with screws. I weigh 220 pounds and i was beatin on it pretty hard so its plenty durable- so long as you don't over inflate your speed bag like i did, lol."
3,Go for better quality,"This is a good deal for the price. But when it comes to tools and gym equipment, better quality is always best! This is acceptable but not great!"
4,Exercise,Just a review of items bought. I have not installed as yet as I am wintering in Florida and will set up when I get home. All items look exactly what I wanted.
3,order imcomplete,"I bought one of these, the set arrived incomplete it lacked the speed bag hand. How do i resolve this situation?B00005R2GR, ""Everlast 6 - Piece platform bag set"". Trackin number SAA0009984451conntec linda.sanchez@seravila.net"
1,Wheres the rest?,"I ordered this for my husband as a Christmaas gift and not only did it come a week later than expected, but it didn't have all of the items. It only had the platform in the box and some of the brackets to mount it. Very dissapointing."
1,terrible quality!!!!,"First off this product was made in china which dissapointed me because I knew that the quality would suffer. When I assembled this product I found that they include all of the hardware EXCEPT the mounting screws. Luckily I'm a carpenter so I had some #14 screws laying around. I mounted the platform and went to inflate the bladder, wet the needle as instructed, but when I tryed to insert it, the bladder detached and I spent 25 minutes trying to find the hole(I never have problems finding ""the hole""). The platform was drilled incorrectly so I had to ream the to make it work. Basically I would NOT reccomend this product to anyone!"
4,Speed bag review,"The equipment is what I expected and is very acceptable to me for my purposes of ""getting and staying fit"". The only thing I changed was the swivel, which added $20 to the total. This was worth the cost to make the speed bag work better. Including the new swivel, the price for this equipment is a good deal."
1,Ya get what ya pay for,"Everlast, but made in China!!??The platform board was broken in half. It was made of some kind of crappy presswood (basically a step above cardboard). The rest of the set had ""cheap"" written all over it.Spend the extra dough and buy American made (if you can even find American made anymore)..."
3,Defective,"This is a good deal, but my bag would not hold air. You will have to go to EVERLAST direct for warranty claims. The seller holds no responsibility after 30 days. Glad we have manufacturers who stand behind their product warranties."
2,Not for serious use,"I admit, I was uneducated and unaware how to use a speed bag prior to buying this setup. The mounting bracket is fine, though it cannot be adjusted. However, the plastic swivel that came with the kit was near useless, as the bag was very slow to react. After spending $20 on a metal swivel, the performance greatly increased. However, it did not equate to the quality and response of the bag at my local gym, so I replaced the bag with a higher grade bag. Now it functions just fine, after dropping $60 in replacement parts. All-in-all, this is definitely a beginner bag, but you outgrow it within a week. Be wise and spend the extra money in the beginning and get a real kit. After all, I was reminded that you get what you pay for."
2,Everlast platform bag,The product seemed okay but was missing part of the set up. We were unable to get the missing piece so we returned the product.
4,good speed bag but needs better swivel,"this is a great kit to get all the items you need for a speed bag set. there is one bad thing about this set, but there is an easy fix. the swivel shown in the picture is NOT the one included in set. the one included in set is a cheap plastic base, with a plastic ball bearing, and a small metal i hook glued into the bearing, with a small spring clip attached to hang tour bag on. of course that wasn't going to fly so i upgraded to the Everlast Professional Speedbag Swivel and it made things great. the next thing after you get good at it is to upgrade to a smaller bag. the bag included is way to big. after you upgrade these two things its a great set and well worth the money."
4,another release that could have been done better,"i have rated the other cd they released on halloween 'bizaar' and this one is slightly better. i have always been an icp fan ever since way back when...if you listen to this cd and compare it to carnival of carnage or the riddlebox its complely different, they have changed their style completly...ever since great m...they have gotten more of a rock attitude in their music...and less serious...i miss the old icp shxt. i am a big icp fan however and have to support them, i have almost ever cd they have made..if u refer to forgotten freshness cd it says its almost impossible im about 5 away from them all..this one is better than bizaar but not much. if your down with the clown you'll be down with this release but its not their best...go in with an open mind...completly open..im out peace"
2,This was the turning point...,"In my opinion, this is the second worst album that ICP as ever put out, second only to the Wraith:Shangri-La. The only good songs on the entire album are ""Cherry Pie,"" which is a remake of ""I Need A Freak,"" and ""Crystal Ball"" which features Twiztid. The hidden skits and songs are pretty funny, but the rest of the stuff if a pathetic attempt to sell out to the mainstream. If you're a die hard ICP fan, you will probably like this, but if you love music and have a brain of your own, then you will see this for what it is."
4,icp is in the house,"this cd has a different feel to it than the others, but it's still a good cd. i would recommend it to everyone to buy."
1,The insane lame posse.........,"I used to be a big ""ICP"" fan. A juggalo as you call it. The faygo swilling dread loving adolescent kid......that me is no more. This is the new me. The one that thinks ICP are uninventive and not funny. Not funny at all. This cd is lame, it's interchangable with the other one even, come on, Bizzar/Bizaar, whatever, what's the difference?It doesn't matter. This is complete garbage. The tracks are so uninventive. Especially the single ""Let's Go All The Way"", in which Shaggy Scooby Doo or whatever screams incenssantly ""Let's go all the way!"" through the entire track.Juggalos, wise up. ICP are very lame and have negative talent. They try to control your mind and possess you to like what they like and dislike what they like. Don't be a sheep. Eminem is a billion times more talented and his records a billion times more worth it, and you know it."
1,Disgusting Vulgar Garbage,"How could anybody listen to this garbage? ICP are just a pair of posers who think its cool to talk about murdering people. What kind of an influence does that have on teens? They should be ashamed of themselves. Besides, their music isn't fresh or original and they are no-talent morons."
4,not so wicked,many of u juggalos and juggalettes may hate this album but it aint so bad. this album shows the nice icp but they stil go on about the same s**t even takin the piss out of sharon osbourne. there is stil some cool songs but if u stil dont like them well i dont know what 2 say. all i can say is if u like shangri la then get both bizzar bizaar albums. see ya later juggalos and juggalettes.
3,Not bad,"You can definitely tell that with this, not as carnival, but definitely packs the violence. But it's them trying to be mainstream."
2,Beware - This product is stoneware.,"The product features of this mug is deceiving. It is not like the other Corelle products which are a composition of vitrelle glass, chip and break resistant and made in USA. This mug is stoneware made in China."
5,Holly jolly mug,"These mugs are a nice size and even though they are a mug and not a cup they look great with the matching plates. Makes a very pretty table.They have body without being bulky. Love ""em!!"
3,Top Ten Shakesphere Stories,Shakespheres Stories was a good book. The book told you about the 3 diffrent typs of writtings he did. It tells you little interesting facts and tidbits about him and the history and actors of his plays. The book wraps up his plays in diffrent point of views you understand for example:Hamlet is explained through an officer writting a police report.
1,THERE IS NO NEED TO BUY THIS ITEM,"This is NOT a digital recorder. This will dub CD's and MP3s to the idiotic sonic stage software created by the woefully stupid minidisc division of Sony.YOU CANNOT USE A MICROPHONE ON THIS UNIT.Obviously they use the word ""recorder"" to falsely market this product. There are plenty of other actual minidisc recorders for the same price on Amazon. It's almost impossible to tell unless the picture shows a red colored hole on the side. All the minidisc products on this site claim to be recorders so it will be hard to tell what you are getting unless you find the specs on a different web site.Of course once you get one that has a LINE/MIC in jak, the recordings are amazing."
4,Good player,"I am very satisfied with this player. I use it to jog/workout and it fits in my hand, is very light and doesn't skip. The ""hold"" option is great because it doesn't let you accidentally press any buttons when enabled. The discs hold tons of music under LP4 compression with very little quality loss. If I had negatives they would be the software because it makes you manage song licenses and doesn't recognize music without them. The digital screen is small and not backlit, but that keeps the player [inexpensive] and makes for longer battery life (I bought rechargable AA's and they work great). A final negative (in comparison to mp3 players) would be the time it takes the software to burn the music onto the disc. They aren't just files you can drag and drop onto a drive, so it takes some time to make a full disc of music. Overall it's a great player though."
2,Just get a CD player...,"I received a MZ-NE410 as a present from my parents a few years ago, and it's really not that good of an MP3 player. I was only able to put 40 songs on one disc, which is the equivalant of 2 CDs. The software is garbage too. Never have I seen such a confusing program. The play/pause/next track/etc. wheel on mine has screwed up for some reason. When I hit Next, it usually stays on the same track, or goes back a track. Your best bet is to either buy a CD player, or go for a better, flash/HDD MP3 player."
2,"Aweful software and ""un-hip"" design","I received this item as a gift and my first impression was that the design was cheesy. It has the look of a walkman for sure. After seeing the cool mp3 players that are out there, I was fairly disappointed in the bulk and am not real pleased with having to use a disk for storage. Although it can hold more songs than a CD player, I wanted to get away from having to keep up with additional pieces of hardware.The second problem I have with this devise is the aweful software. Lots of problems occured with getting songs recorded onto the disk - too many to mention - because of conflicts with my computer's operating system. A chat with a live help customer service representative gave me a solution for one problem, but it only gave way to new problems.I am returning this minidisk player as soon as the holiday return lines dwindle and have already purchased an actual mp3 player that I have read wonderful reviews about time and time again."
1,Not working,Would not record anything at the very onset. Useless. Didn't bother returning - not worth my time or effort and box already thrown away.
5,Great!,I go snowboarding a lot and needed some music while I did. People may say that they won't bring this cause its flimsy and what not. Let me tell you I'm not that great a boarder and I fall. A lot. And this thign holds up to the cold and damp just great.Also much much cheaper than all those hard disk players.
2,Great hardware -- pitiful software,"My high hopes and expectations for this music player were dashed as soon as I plugged it into my PC. If you love Winamp or Media Player and are looking for an intuitive interface, you'll hate the software that comes with this fine piece of hardware. Its contrived ""copy protection"" is a joke and a nuisance. If I could find a third-party interface package, I'd be happy again with my Net MD."
2,Sony is a screwed up!,"Sony is so paranoid of people stealing music that they've made their minidisk player worthless! I have downloaded sermons that I tried to put on a minidisk to no avail, the mp3's just won't convert or something. Other music I have will download fine. Check out Sony's ATRAC system before you buy this, it is a nightmare transferring content to the MD. The sound however is really good, Sony knows how to split the stereo up to very good effect, but overall I sold this because I couldn't listen to what I wanted to. Check out eBay too, they're going for $50! That tells you something right there when you pay $100 and sell it the next day for $50 on eBay!"
5,Totally Awesome Player!,"Ever since my cd player had broken, I had been quite distraught and had asked my mother continuously for an mp3 player. Naturally, at first she refused to get me one. However, after weeks of pestering, she finally realized I was serious. She showed me a few mp3/cd players which interested me, but just didn't strike that interest cord hard enough. Then my mom showed me this Sony mp3/mini-disc player. I was ecstatic when she said she'd buy it for me. When I got home with it, I hooked up the program and was completely amazed!!! The mini-discs burn faster and better than cds (not to mention you can rerecord and erase any songs you don't want). The player itself is small and easy to carry. It's absolutely wonderful!!! This is possibly one of the greatest things I have ever received, and it seems sturdy enough to last quite a long time. Just buy and enjoy!!!!"
5,This thing is great,"My god! this thing is 10 times better than what you can imagine.Writing, deleting, and rewritting is so easy with this product.One mini disc can hold up to 81 songs with a greater quality sound than a C.D would. If you are thinking about buying a C.D player...STOP! A minidisc will serve soo much better. YOU WILL LOVE IT!"
2,Bad software,"SonicStage, the software used to upload music to the NetMD is extremely un-userfriendly. Quite frequently when i try to upload a mix of music, some songs will never make it on while others will be on the player 3 times!I found that the main circular button used to change tracks/ pause/ and play, wears out quickly and you have to press it either very hard or multiple times to achieve the required action.The only reason that this player gets 2 stars is because the NetMD runs off of a single AA battery making it great for long trips or plane rides, because you dont have to worry about finding a place to recharge the battery."
1,"Good hardware, bad software!","The player itself is a good piece of hardware, but after a while the software refused to work. After loading my computer with SP2 it refused to even start the program. For a better idea of the amount of complaints with this product and other similar sony MD players check out this site:http://www.petitiononline.com/Sonymd/petition.html"
4,Great Product. Use a different Software though,"Sony's MiniDisc players are good alternatives to other MP3 players. You can fit more music on cheap MD's, and have multiple MD's for the moods you are in.As for the software, Sony finally got wise and formed an agreement with realOne player to use it to download music to the player. Once you've loaded the netMD drivers, download the realOne player, and the plug in for Sony devices. You will be much happier in the long run."
2,It lasts but not for long,"I first bought a Sony MD player, the same black one as shown here, three years ago. Shortly after, it broke because the insert where the Minidisks go stopped closing and opening and nothing could be done to fix this. Besides this problem, I was satisfied with the MD player's capacity and trusted that it was my inconsideration by which the player broke.So, I bought a new one. This one lasted not even a year before a problem occured with it. This time the earphone jack isn't working. I can hear from one headphone but not the other with any headphones I use. This is horrible. Now I had to ducktape it so that it somewhat works.If you're looking for a cheap alternative to classic MP3 players, then this is for you. Great capacity, ok sound quality, but let me warn you, if you're looking for something that lasts long, don't buy this because you'll be highly dissapointed."
1,Doesn't work with Windows 98 OS,"It would be real nice if the Target or Sony websites even gave you a CLUE that this product does not work with Windows 98, you have to at least have Windows 98 Second Edition. This information should be listed under &quot;Technical Specifications&quot;. I purchased this product on-line from Target, and NOWHERE does it mention this fact. I now have a product that I bought for my son for Christmas that he can't use, not to mention the fact that I just threw $100.00 away on something that doesn't work with my operating system."
5,Great Buy,"As a long-time minidisc user, I can say that this unit is easily one of the best MD units for such a low price. If you can do without a microphone input, the unit should readily handle all your recording/playback needs. The unit is extremely easy to use, has a relatively good battery life, and - for whatever its worth - is styled with a classy black and silver case. LP4 allows some 5 hours of recording on a single disc, LP2 about 2 and 1/2 hours (with better quality), and standard speed (near CD-quality) up to 80 minutes. Don't get too flustered about the software ... if you are a typical user, it works just fine, and if you want extra functionality because you are a recording enthusiast, you can use other free software. A bargain."
2,Minidisc player,"The seller was superb however the product and program with the minidisc recorder was substandard. Sony has added and deleted features from earlier versions so this generation is incompatable with the way I have previously used a minidisc recorder, namely recording through a microphone or line input. Sony now wants to limit the types of music that can be recorded so it is no longer feasable to record albums etc to the minidisc."
4,love this player,"My husband bought this for my birthday, when I asked for a MP3 player...and I love it. Although I was skeptical about the disks at first, I now enjoy being able to record my music according to artist, genre, or whatever, onto seperate disks. This player is durable, compact, and, with my own car adaptor, I can play it while driving. There is alot of things I am still learning to do, and the software is, as mentioned elsewhere, horrid. None of the directions that came with the software made sense when I looked at the computer screen! I have since decided that the instructions must have been for an older version of the software. I just had to play around and figure things out for myself. I don't like that it only allows me to record MY OWN PROPERTY 3 times, but I will try to find a way around that."
3,Good hardware,"The hardware is solid, the max volume is very loud but not deafening, which is sometimes needed in crowded places where you need to zone out.The sonicstage software feels clumsy and is not very intuitive. I reccomend this product but using a different software studio."
1,arrived DOA,"No big surprise. I stopped buying anything with the Sony brand back in the late 90's when Sony started to develop a reputation for worsening quality problems. There are almost no mini disc players in existence any more, again thanks to it being released by Sony in the 90's then promptly left to die on the vine.Mini disc has very minimal digital artifact from compression to digital file on a re-recordable disc. I tried this recorder when my 14 year old Sharp minidisc player stopped working. But this one arrived d.o.a. so I returned it for a refund.My Sony minidisc deck I bought in the 90's had technical problems since the day it was new, and still does. But today, there is no other brand that makes minidisc. Personally, I will never again buy anything with the Sony name."
3,Read this before you share it with your child,"I am astonished that these reviewers have said they read this book to their five year old daughters. I do not believe that this book is appropriate for any child under the age of eight. While I strongly believe it is a very good book about Chinese adoption, I caution anyone purchasing it as a gift for their children against simply sitting down to read it with them without thoroughly reading it first themselves."
2,Disappointed,"The book is wonderful.....but not at all relevant for a single mom who adopted from China. There are several references to Daddy. I was disappointed. The book is useless to me. I wish there was a single mom version of this book. At a minimum, I wish the book description would have told me that this was a book with references to a two parent situation (Mommy and Daddy) as I wouldn't have bought it."
3,great collection,"Here's a great collection from the lovely Kay Starr. Most of these songs are from very early in her recording career (Starr first signed with Capitol Records in 1945).Most of these numbers are taken from the early 1940s Capitol days (""Honeysuckle Rose"", ""A Woman Understands"", ""The Hucklebuck"", ""For You"", ""Mama Goes Where Papa Goes"", etc.). Starr was marketed as the wholesome girl-next-door, and the material she was given matched her persona.Starr was a very successful jazz and big-band vocalist in her native America, but she was arguably a bigger celebrity in England, where she still has many fanclubs. Her first hit single in the UK was 1952's ""Comes A-Long A-Love"", which peaked at Number 1 in the charts; ""Am I Toy or Treasure?"" (Number 17); and ""Changing Partners"" (Number 4).There are many quality Kay Starr discs available, but this one concentrates squarely on her early recordings. Well worth seeking out.[Planet Media PML-1043]"
2,Some what disappointing,This book has a lot of very good information of taking care of your dogs health (Although most of the advice would apply to any dog). I was particularly disappointed in the section on puppy selection which was my main reason for buying this book. Very superficial information.
4,German Shepherds,This is a good book with practical information. It is not very in depth but is still quite useful.
4,Applause for author Peter Richardson,"Applause for author Peter Richardson for his prodigous research and enlightening prose. Carey McWilliams, possibly more than any other person, influenced hot button social and governance issues in California and America during the mid-1900s. If one really wants to know what a multi-talented activist can achieve, ""American Prophet"" is a must read!"
5,use with a scrubby,"This is a great bar of soap - good lather, nice scent that isn't too powerful or laboratory-generated. I would recommend using it with a scrubby or washcloth because the little exfoliation beads lather up with the soap more uniformly than if the bar is used with just hands. I noticed that if I didn't use my scrubby then the beads would clump together into larger beads that just stayed in the bar getting bigger with each use. I've been using this soap for years and won't change it any time soon."
2,"Nice pictures, no good for planning","The photos in this book are nice and there are a few good maps and travel tips, but I found it lacking in useful information for planning my trip. I'm used to travel books having information on several attractions, how to get to them, how much they cost, what the hours are, etc.This book is more of a storyteller than a planner."
3,It's just okay,It works but it isn't as great as I thought it would be. I bought it to measure peanut butter and other sticky foods but it's easier to just use a regular dry measure and a spatula.
2,OK but nothing specail..,"Got them as a set after seeing Alton Brown use them..Works great but is a real pain in the butt to clean up afterwards if you measuring greasy materials.. Water based like honey not an issue, butoil based like butter, lard have to run them through the dish washer on sanitize top rack and I know someday they will get warped..Would not buy them again.."
2,a missed opportunity,"The concept for this book is good. Unfortunately it misses in achieving that concept.The reproduction of photographs is very well done, though more attention could have been paid to selection. A number are the same ones seen so frequently. The captions for some are incorrect or insufficiently informative.The comments by persons involved in the various projects are a definite plus. The introductions to these by Burrows and parenthetical comments, however, frequently detract from these.The narration by Burrows introducing each project or mission contains numerous factual errors or misrepresentations which seriously detract from what would otherwise be an excellent book."
4,The Evolutionist Deconstructs Creationism,"Von Hippel is systematic in finding flaws in the most important aspects of the argument for Creationism. Too bad this kind of debunking is not part of the day to day discourse. And, if one likes poetic fanticizing, the author's poetic expression in the last several pages, drives home the main points of his anti-creation thesis."
3,hmmm watchout,Absolutely delicious until you read the ingredients. Corn syrup and cancer ingredient heaven.. however very tasty and has a very good supply of protein. Very easy on the run but there are better out there.
5,70s/80s Rio Samba Enredo Classics!,"From the first number - Lendas Do Abaete (Mangueira, 1973) to the last - Terra Brazilis (Unidos de Lucas, 1986), this CD contains many Rio Samba Enredo classics familiar to Brazilians who followed the carnavals during these two decades. For those samba fans who are sick and tired of the recent late 90s enredos which can sound a bit too slick and complicated, this CD is a welcoming breeze of fresh air. I find the bateria sound of the 70s enredo-selections on this CD raw and exciting: O Mundo Melhor De Pixinguinha (Portela 1974) or Brasil Berco Dos Imigrantes (Imperio Serrano 1977), just to name two examples. On the other hand, the 80s selection on this CD offer classics with everlasting melodies: Bum Bum Paticundum Prugurundum (Imperio Serrano 1983) and E Hoje (Uniao Da Ilha Do Gouvernador 1982) are two of my favorites that can be found on this album.All in all, a recommended cd for those who want to know more about the Rio samba enredos from the 70s and 80s."
5,excellent review of pertinent topics in raising children,the authors who are experienced child psychiatrists bring together medical aspects of children's behavior with practical and useful advice. the result is a highly readable book that belongs to every parent and clinician's reference shelf.
1,Very disappointing book,"The title ""Encyclopedia"" suggests a book full of information, but the text of this book is sparse, disjointed, and occasionally downright weird. (It starts with the voyage of the Mayflower. Really. I could not possibly make that up.)The color photos of the dolls in the most recent edition are lovely, but a surprising number of the book's photos are of old advertising materials, newspaper clippings, promotional displays and even price lists, plus photos of the company's founding family. Far from an encyclopedia about the popular Ginny doll, the book reads as if someone published the company's scrapbook."
4,Ginny doll encyclopedia,The book arrived on time. The price was reasonable as it was originally 30 bucks according to the inside jacket. It smelled new and cracked open like new. Seller SAID it was new. Great photos of dolls in order of year made. Lots of clothes for the dolls pictured. Happy with the product.
2,Disappointing,"I got lured to read Perez-Reverte's Fencing Master on the double account that all my friends were big fans of him (especially impressed by La tabla de Flames, his book on chess and Renaissance paintings), and that I am a keen fencer, having learnt the art of foil with an authentic Spanish-speaking Master.I should have known better. Perez-Reverte's fencing technicalities are bogus, but that's OK because nobody has ever really been able to express what a sword fight feels like in writing, not since the art the literary duel fell out of fashion at any rate. But what was so disappointing was the plot and the one-dimensional characters, which completely failed to live up to the author's reputation for clever mystery.Also, either the traduction (in French) was very poor or the style was terrible."
1,"Disappointing, especially after his previous books","This books was quite a disappointment. After devouring Flanders Panel, Club Dumas and Seville Communion, I was expecting the same mystery and complexity. For this book, the plot was poorly developed, the villaness was seriously one-dimensional and stereotypical (a real letdown after the female characters in the previous books). I kept reading the book in the hopes of the plot becoming more interesting but no such luck. The ending wasn't as earth shattering as I'd hoped, judging from Reverte's previous works. I'm glad I didn't buy this book!"
5,Get multiple copies and give as gifts,My wife loves this CD. She plays it going to work and coming home every day.It makes for a great gift idea also.
3,I Can Only Imagine: Ultimate Power Anthems of the Christian Faith,"I normally buy my Christian CDs hoping to memorize some of the songs. In this CD I could only find 2 songs with good enough music to help my memory. ""I can only Imagine"" and ""Basics of Life"". Overall I give the CD a 3*."
5,As Good As It Gets........,"I Can Only Imagine is a compilation of probably the best Christian songs ever. They range from older songs(from the 70's) to songs that you may have just recently heard over the past few years. I first saw this CD when I was at my local library and decided to borrow it. Boy, I was glad I did. Honestly, ever song from start to finish touches your soul. You can go through both discs without saying ""eh, I wonder what's next?"" You can't always say that with CD's, especially two-disc ones. Personally, I think the two most heart-wrenching, touching songs are ""I Can Only Imagine"" and ""Rise Again."" If your a newer Christian or have been saved for decades, you will fall in love with these CD's."
3,Too many songs by non-original artists,"I like a rehash of an old song... as long as a new take is presented. This set had artists performing great hits (like Indescribable) by artists who just didn't give you that same feeling of power and purpose and praise. The selection of songs is amazing. The selection of artists is less than stellar (though there are some greats on here too). For this, I have to lower my rating to three stars. Hope this helps."
2,"Ok CD, but not outstanding","I bought this CD because, from a TV ad, it had so many of my favorite songs and artists on it, but I've been disappointed with the actual product. Some of the songs are not sung by the orginal artist and don't quite measure up. While it is a good value for the money spent, it is not the exceptional album I thought it would be."
3,Good collection,"Good collection, but not necessarily my favorite versions, by my preferred artists. Still good to pop in an sing along to!"
4,Praise the Lord,This CD has a variety of singers all singing praise songs. All have an up beat and focus on the Lord. All are worth listening to and singing with.
1,Aryou freaking kidding me?,"To start with I am ABSOLUTELY in no way shape or form anti-christian.This is a very sorry excuse for ""worship"".It's simply an excuse for so-called christians to do nothing more for their faith other than saying Jesus and God a few times a day and calling it good.Don't you think that He would want people to something about their faith besides singing the same over-done ""songs of praise""?"
5,great,Books came in great shape and have held up very well for being paperbacks. Enjoying the series very much. Thanks.
1,Let the buyer beware,"This book is predicated on the false Christian belief that we are, when all is said and done, the ones who allow God to save us. The final ""savior"" in the book is not Christ or his substitutionary sacrifice but the power of human prayer. This novel perpetuates the false teaching that fallen people have the ability to decide for God and ultimately save their society. It is a feel good novel that puts the spotlight on the unbiblical notion that if we manufacture good works for God, then he will bless us. This ""Christian"" novel contributed to the silly notion after 9/11 that our prayers create a wall of defense around our nation. The novel is misleading at best. Go read Romans or Galatians again for the real way salvation works in the Christian faith."
4,Prayer activates angles,"This was the first book that I have read by Mr. Peretti. I must admit I had my doubts, but now I must say ""WoW!"" I now truly believe in angels. The detail that Mr. Peretti gives about spiritual warfare is amazing. It assured me that God is really working on our behalf we just have to pray, pray, pray!"
5,great book,"geting used to the writing style of Peretti takes a few pages, but once I did, I could not put the book down.This is not the first time I read this book. I originally read these books when they first came out and I was in college. I started the first chapter thinking I'd finish them after finals. It didn't work. I read the first one all the way through.I should have studied... but it turned out OK- I got good grades :-)"
5,GREAT Books + GREAT Price,"I first read these Frank Peretti books in the early 1990's. I couldn't put them down - literally! My now grown son asked to borrow my copies but instead, I purchased this set as a gift to him for his own library. I bought this set because it was such a good deal!"
5,How inspiring!,"Frank Peretti does it again! He captures the spiritual wars and battles so perfectly, it's as if he's standing there watching. If you need a spiritual boost and want an EXCITING story line, read these. AWESOME!"
4,The Present Darkness,This was a fascinating and thought-provoking novel. It was a fast read and it was totally gripping.
2,Lasted A Week,"I bought this everlast swivel a week ago along with an everlast 4210 speedbag from acadamy. I am not a boxer, and do not plan to be one. I only bought the speedbag and swivel to do something physically active that isn't as boring as running. The swivel only lasted a week till the first link (the eyelet) completely detached from the ball socket. There is a small screw inside the socket's ball which attaches the first link. After using an allen wrench to put it back together. Again, after 20 minutes of practice on the speed bag, the swivel broke again. Judging by the construction of other speed bag swivels, this is the only swivel where this problem arises, and is likely to occur often. I would recomend this swivel only if you are getting a speed bag for a youngster (under 14), or just need one for display. If you plan on spending more than a couple hours a week messing around on a speed bag, go with the Everlast Top Professional Chain Link Swivel (Model # 4444)."
1,This will break,"This swivel came on a board that I bought. It broke once pretty quickly. I tried to fix it and it lasted about 5 minutes and broke again. Don't buy it and if it comes default on a board, make sure to buy a better swivel."
1,Looks elsewhere for a swivel.,I hate this swivel. Guaranteed to break down after a month or 2. The threads in the plastic ball will strip in no time. Could have easily been avoided with some better design. Everlast should slap themselves for this one.
1,Terrible,"No, this is not another ""mine broke in one week"" review. This is not good enough to be used for a week. It's slow, noisy and completely worthless."
4,Great Ball Hook Swivel,"This is an excellent product at a great price, particularly as it is difficult to find metal ball hooks today (the best for ""Bible boxing""). When you first get it, be sure to unscrew the hook and then re-secure it using super glue. This will prevent it from falling off after repeated hitting. It is a little slower than the metal ball hooks but I really like it for the price."
1,Hip-Hop violins just don't do it for me...,"There are two tracks that are worth listening to on this CD: Miss You and maybe Mexico. The Quartet tried really hard, but I didn't prefer their attempt at trying to copy the tempo and beat of the originals. The CD sounds like it's an attempt at a new hip-hop violin genre that makes me feel like I'm at a square dancing party. My 2 cents: slow the songs down, don't try hip-hop violin, copy the music and flow. My 2 cents to the buyers: Save your [money] and get another album instead; then search for Miss You and Mexico on a P2P like Kazaa!"
2,Sorry To Disappoint,"Several other big named artists have released impressive orchestral versions of their music in recent years. Perhaps I was so excited to see an instrumental album of Incubus songs that I had unrealistic expectations. Although I am a fan of the strings, the music seems to lack passion and sounds rather flat. It is definately missing that certain something that makes it great."
3,Expected more!,"As a big Incubus fan and a violinist, I thought this CD had the potential to be fabulous. I will say that you can recognize most of the songs, and it is a peaceful, tranquil way to listen to Incubus. However, often the strings sound similar to tuning instruments in an Elementary School orchestra (boy does that take me back!). Perhaps they could have selected more experienced artists, because the Incubus songs are so beautiful."
1,what the?,Okay the sheer number of string tributes being released is getting a bit rediculous. First of all we have a terrible set selection. I realize that the better incubus songs would be difficult to convert to a stringed format but he could've at least tried. Where is Deep Inside? or anything from SCIENCE for that matter. It only happens to be their best album and yet it is completely unrepresented here. Worst of all the arranger uses this album as a tool to promote his own compositions in the last track. Shameful! Why buy this stuff?
1,soo bad,"this is the worst version of any incubus song, even my cat could wail an incubus song better than this. even if i ever did recognize any not of this as being an incubus song, its still crap. Most of this CD is an unrecognizable slice of junk. Buy a proper INCUBUS cd!"
4,Worth more than a penny...,"As you'd expect from a compilation by Charlie Peacock, One Point Oh is full of intelligent, slightly-out-of-the-mainstream pop. The quality of the tracks varies, but given that these aren't well-known artists, you just might find something you really like. For me, that track was ""Falling to Ashes"" from Sarah Hart's debut albumGoodbye Jane. A decade later, it remains one of my favorite songs, and at the current price of $0.01 I'd recommend this CD for that track alone."
4,Great Tradition to Start with Young Children,"This is a great book. I bought it because it reminded me of an easter book, The Great Easter Egg Hunt. I bought that book a couple of years ago and started an Easter tradition.Inside the big book are smaller books. I plan to start a Christmas tradition with my children of reading the individual books on the evenings preceding Christmas Eve. This is similar to what I do with the Easter book. I am really looking forward to it because my five year old and two year old had so much fun with the Easter book earlier this year."
5,Great book,"I loved this book. I'm a fan of history and this book provides such a diverse account of the history of the world. It is not biased at all, which many books tend to be. I was glad to see that the author included people from all walks of life. It definately makes the book better and I recommend it for everyone."
1,poor telling of a good story,"I was highly disappointed in Cherokee Rose. The Lacy's have written a 19th century story with an unrealistic Victorian sappiness. Everyone gets saved, and those who do not, simply disappear; one glaring error is that Asheville did not have rail access until 1880, long after the events in Cherokee Rose; The term ""Smokies"" may or may not have been in use by the white man at that time ... The Indians referred to what we call the Great Smokies as ""land of blue smoke"". I was left hanging as to why the family of the white child were not sought after by the relatives in NC. That said, the plan of salvation is well documented, and the reader would have little excuse to comprehend it. As a writer, I try to be careful to make my books believable. Cherokee Rose was not believeable."
1,Historically inaccurate!,"Please see my comment to Mandy's review. There I only skimmed the surface of the errors I found in this book. I DO recommend anything written by Theda Perdue on the subject of the Cherokee, if you don't mind non-fiction. Most are available here at Amazon.Remember that fiction may include some fact. Be sure you know which is which, please."
4,A Historically informing book,"The thing I enjoyed most about this book was all the historical information it gave. I picked this book up at a card store, and did not know what to expect. I was delightfully surprised! Cherokee Rose was a remarkable girl, and Britt Claiborne was the perfect match for her. I really liked this book and will probably eventually read it again."
5,Best Noise Ever,"This thing is the best i have ever seen. It is so loud. Anything over half volume and the house is shaking. There is nothing more to say, it is great"
3,Good book but liked some others more....,"I have read several books recently on adoption and in reuniting with their heritages:Helie LeeStill Life with RiceIn the Absence of SunCindy ChampnellaThe Waiting Child: How the Faith and Love of One Orphan Saved the Life of AnotherI enjoyed all these books immensely and hoped Katy Robinson's ""A Single Square Picture: A Korean Adoptee's Search for Her Roots"" would be as enjoyable.Altho I found this book to be engrossing and a real page-turner, I was disappointed by how it ended. I will not go into details as not to ruin the ending for other readers, but I enjoy books that tie up loose ends and answer some questions brought up.I hope there is a follow-up to this novel."
1,"Boring, moved soo slow, wordy writing",This book does not hold my attention. It's boring and a snore! Her writing is so wordy. She's definitely not a succint writer. Every sentence could take out about five words to make it flow better. I wish I didn't want to put this book down after every other page.
2,dont quit your day job!,"sadly, the only thing this book did well was disappoint. Ms. Robinson should write cookbooks, for the tradegy of her mother's choice was served up like so much soggy, grey tofu."
5,cd players' days are over,"Five hours of high quality music on a single disc, radio/tv/weatherbank tuner, capability to rewrite endlessly and to arrange music by folders, easy menus, user-friendly software, extra long battery life, very compact and stylish, what more do you need from a portable music player/recorder? And this model has it all. I'll never look back to a cd player again. I bought this unit at a sony style store where I could test and compare vitually every mini disc player sony markets at the moment. It's not easy to make a choice since there are so many sleek, stylish, tiny models that catch the eye. Well, the look, performance and the price of this model turned to be the most attractive to me.A piece of advice when choosing the software to burn your music, either from CDs or your own downloaded MP3 files - use SonicStage, it's the easiest and least confusing."
1,Be Careful - only a 90 day Warranty??????,"Got mine 7 months ago, used it about 1 hour per day, thought it was fine until the remote went up. Now none of the buttons function as labeled (""volume"" changes tracks, ""display"" changes play mode, ""stop"" doesn't work at all). Unfortunately I am just now realizing that it only had a 90 day warranty and a new remote costs $100+! Seems like it should have lasted a little longer than 7 months... Also agree with others comments re: headphones (unusable), and small, hard-to-press buttons on the remote."
4,Great little player,"Featuring an amazing battery life and exceptional audio quality, this is a player for people on the move. Very good built quality, easy to use remote control (although a backlit screen would be greatly appreciated), very fast MD recording process through REAL ONE. The radio on the remote is a big bonus and it's quite efficient especially in areas of good reception. For the price it's a bargain!"
4,A Great Product,"I was actually doing research to purchase a Digital Jukebox when I came across the Sony Mini Disc Players. I ordered this one and am very pleased with it. Some og=f the selling points for me was the portability, the fact that Mini Discs are much more cost effective than Flash Memory. installed the software and was able to copy a few of my favorite CD's in a matter of minutes! The sound was great. I taped in both LP2 and LP4 and am pleased with it. Even the not so good headphones sounded ok.The only thing I would say that I am not so thrilled with is the remote and the fact that the radio is in the remote, otherwise I am very pleased with this product."
2,"If it wasnt for the software, this would be a great product.","Because Sony's SonicStage software is presumed to suck, nobody uses it unless they have to. Because I use iTunes, I am forced to burn a disc in iTunes of the music that I want to put on my mini-disc. Then I have to rip that disc into SonicStage which can take a long time. After that I can then select the music from SonicStage and burn a minidisc. This whole Process can take as long as 45 minutes. After that ordeal, the Walkman works great. I hate SonicStage so much because what I have just described is going on as I write this review."
5,Worth it,"Mp3 players will be a thing of the past if MD players take note from this little creation. It has everything desirable for a music machine; small, long battery life (mine averages 26 hours w/ volume max), remote, sound controls, great holding capacity (5.3 hours per disc), radio AM/FM tuner, and good looks. My only real complaint is that sound control is only accessible through the remote, which I hardly use since I got new headphones, which have a long cord, thus together making a cord longer than me. Other than that this is a well worth contraption. Better than Cd's, better than Mp3's."
1,Nice recorder - but Sony's warranty needs work,"I checked the Sony website and if I needed to return this item for repair, they would want over $100 ($115?) to exchange for a refurbished unit. Crazy. The SonicStage software is a pain. Other than that, it's a lovely audio device."
2,for people who still like discs,"wow. this player is really bad. really bad. if you still like having to change out discs then this player is for you. you can fit 5 hours on, but only if you record in LP4 mode, whick is lower quality. i have over 500 songs, so changing discs is a pain if you forgot them at home. Good for disc people, bad for forgetful people or real music fans.P.S- Get an ipod. alot better"
3,Please help,"I just got a new unlocked Motorola V195. But found the following issues1) The phone does not ring when it is charging. I made sure that the ring option is loud at all times. Even then it does not ring. I tried to keep ring and vibrate. ANd when charging and when calls come, the phone vibrates but does not ring. Can someone help?2) The speaker phone also does not work when the phone is charging. Is this some stupid software glitch or is it problem with the phone."
4,great,"The only reason I did not rate this product five stars is because I haven't viewed it yet. It was received very quickly, and looks to be in excellent condition as promised."
3,About 33.333 % ..........,"better than it's predecesor ""Small"", but I hear the spinoff ""Large"" will be better."
4,Great tv series and a good dvd release.,"This is the only show I currently watch on tv. I don't find anything else really worth watching and I'm glad to own this on DVD. While it is a quality DVD release, what I find disappointing is that Arquette and Weber did not give any commentaries on the discs. While some behind the scenes crew did, including the creator of the series, it would have been really nice to hear Arquette and Weber comment on some episodes. Aside from that, it was a good DVD release. Maybe they can get Arquette and Weber to do some commentaries on the third season DVD release. I am currently watching the second season on DVD and as of yet, haven't come across any commentaries from them on that set either."
5,Good show,"This is a very good show. No other that is depicted in this way, but the best way possible. This show has lead me to a higher fasication with mediums and their work."
1,Snap front fleece robe,This robe's sizing was off by about 2 sizes too small. I didn't reorder because I did not want to risk having to send it back again. I ordered a different robe with it and it was a bit large but the same size so I don't know how the seller sizes there clothing.
5,Everything what looks like gold...,"Very beautyful pen. If buying a fountain pen, than it has to be from WATERMAN. Best writing quality - very smooth. Color of ink looks very elegant.It was a present for my girlfriend. She loves it!"
5,OLD FRIEND TO SPENCER ROAD,"SPENCER ROAD IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS. THE PROOF OF A TRULY FINE BOOK IS IN THE RE-READING--DOES IT HOLD UP? SPENCER ROAD DOES. THE LANGUAGE IS SHARP AND THE DICTION IS WORD-PERFECT. WITH EACH READING THE IMAGES GROW CLEARER. MORRIS SMITH HAS A DISTINCT VOICE WITHOUT AIMING FOR DISTINCTION. NONE OF THAT TRYING TO WRITE ""SOUTHERN."" JANICE DAUGHARTY, AUTHOR OF LIKE A SISTER"
1,A waste of good money.,"I owned this phone for a whole 7 MONTHS before it just quit working for no apparent reason. Up to that point, I was very happy with it. I have been a fairly consitent Uniden customer, but this phone wasted my money."
2,DON'T BUY THIS PHONE,It seems to be a great phone but after a year the keypad stops working and you cant dial anyones number. I am not the only one who has had this problem and if you read other reviews you will see many people with the same problem. DONT BUY THIS PHONE.
2,Not Good,"Had the phone for a little over 1 year and the unit just stopped working. Was a good phone until then, just cannot believe the short life it had. The unit does not get a dial tone and talk keeps flashing on the LED. Tried their online support and they had me do this and that stating it would correct the issue; however, it still remains broken. This is the only phone I have had that only lasted a little over a year. I suggest you buy a different brand phone that will last longer than this one."
2,good fun for a little while,"When i first go this phone, I really liked it. The sound was great and the battery life was exceptional. However, after a year the keypad has begun to stuck and now it is totally unusable. I am unable to dial any numbers. I have to buy a new phone again."
5,Clear means Quality,I just purchased this phone and the quality of this phone is wonderful. The calls are crystal clear. I wouldn't spend the money to try and step into the top end Panasonic. (...)
1,Broken after one year,"This product worked great for almost one year to the day after purchase. The number keys have stopped working. Unless you buy a new phone every year, I would avoid."
1,Uniden 2.4ghz cordless with answering machine,"We bought this product in March 2002 and have had to send it to repair twice. The handset looses volume from the earpiece and the mouthpiece, the answering machine sound quality is full of static and fades. I have not had any luck in repairing this item or having it replaced to date. I would not recommend it to anyone at this point."
2,Loved it...until it died,"Perfect sound quality, feels like a quality product...until it died on me inexplicably--had it for 18 months."
1,Tru346,"I owned this phone for less than 1 year, I have to say the 900 MHz works just as well. The phone went dead in less than 1 year; replaced the battery for $17.00; still doesn't work. An expensive phone for only 1 year lifespand. I'd go with the cheaper Uniden's phones - I'm going on 3 years on my 900MHz Uniden and it also works better outside."
4,Uniden TRU346 2.4 GHZ DSS Titanium Cordless Phone Caller ID,"I've found the clarity of this phone to be superior over my 900MHZ. I haven't encountered any static problems and the clarity is the same as you get from a corded phone. The distance that you can travel with this phone is also exceptional. It has some nice features such as a large backlit display, pager, volume control and an automatic timer that let's you know how long your conversation lasted.The reason I didn't rate this phone 5 stars is 2-fold:1. The design of this phone places the entire display area of the phone directly against your face. This creates the need for frequent cleaning of the phone because of make-up smudges, oil, etc.2. This phone can't be operated when your using a microwave oven or other similar appliances because it creates too much interference."
2,looks good but the sound is very hollow,"I bought this based on reviews here. I am returning the phone.The features of the phone are nice, I like the feel and look of the phone. The size is good, the buttons are very workable.However! The sound quality is awful. It's far worse than my old no-features cordless AT&T 900 MHz phone. It's worse than my cell phone. If this is the best of the 2.4 GHz phones, I'm not buying one and I'll deal with the sticky keys on my AT&T. I'd rather have the sound clarity. This phone has a very hollow and tinny sound. And if someone was speaking quietly it would be hard to hear them.I can't recommend this phone if you are concerned with sound quality. If you just want features and a pretty phone, then you'll be fine."
2,not PLEASLANTLY surprised,"The worship music is awesome. I bought the CD listed ""new"" and when it came it skipped coming straight from the package. Very disappointed with that! I would definitely be hesitant to purchase a CD again."
4,Classic Leonard,"Religious and mystical and good plot. As an Ex-Michigander, Northwest suburbs, enjoy knowing many of the locales where action takes place."
3,Not one of his best,"E. Leonard is my favorite author, but this book failed to meet my expectations. It just was not up to his standards in my book, but he is getting up there in years. He has been writing for decades and who can complain about a story not being quite as captivating as others when they have been on the scale as Leonard's have. Still, a good read."
2,Disappointing,I have read everything by Leonard and this one ranks at the bottom. Just could not get into it.
1,A Real Lemon and Bad Service from JVC,"After 4.5 years with this JVC,the tube died. we are not the kind of people who trade-up with every new innovation -- we just expect that $900 will get us a TV that lasts longer than a toaster oven. This product was not under warranty and while we didn't expect JVC to replace the set, we did expect some kind of accomodation with respect to replacement parts. JVC refused to stand behind its product and told us that we are SOL. I won't buy another JVC and I hope you don't either. Stick with a Sony (our old set is still around and going strong)."
4,Works surprisingly well for price paid,"I purchased this to hold a Hair Ware 100% Human Hair Mannequin BB44156 that i purchased to practice basic braiding techniques. While I had some issues with the mannequin itself, this base that I affixed it upon is quite efficient. The swivel style top that inserts into the model head swivels in every direction easily and the tension can be adjusted on it by tightening or looseing the nut that secures it. I know that this is somewhat hard to understand when reading (you kinda have to experience it to get the idea)and don't count on any included instruction to tell you how the pieces fit together as there aren't any! But never fear, as you don't need an engineering degree to figure it out-- and there are only three pieces to work with. I have had it only three weeks, but I do manipulate the model head on this base quite a bit and it's still holding up."
3,Vacum Mannequin Head Holder,I'm just a student at a beauty school. I saw this vacuum stand mannequin head holder and thought it was a little high but I need one and thought the color look pretty nice so I brought this and then when I receive it in the mail it was a dull looking turquiose color. It was not the same color on their advertise picture.
3,"It had its moments, but...","<0.02>It had its moments, but the story and music was a bit monotonous. I was expecting this anime to have a really good soundtrack since part of the premise is about metal and hard rock. However, they used the same song (pretty much a couple of riffs) in every episode, and even though it was pretty good, it got boring by the end of the series. The story was pretty typical, and it wasn't presented in a very fluid manner.</0.02>"
1,Very poor translation,"Thinking that I was buying an Anthea Bell and Derek Hockridge translation, I was in for a disappointment. Thought the translation is adequate, the humor is lost. If you can buy a British version of this comic(or any other Asterix for that matter), do so by all means. In the Brit version Bell and Hockridge do a superb job of translating (and punning) and have enough literary and contemporary references to keep even grown ups amused. This American version like it says, IS strictly for 9-12 year olds."
1,TERRIBLE translation,"I agree with the reviews above-the translation in this one is horrible. The name changes are universally poor, the jokes have been forcibly removed, and it feels like a skeleton of the original. Getafix will always be Getafix, Vitalstatistix the same. Beg or plead for an earlier English translation, it would be worth twice what you pay for this one."
3,I agree with the reader from Dallas.,"Not only is the translation disappointing, the key characters around Asterix and Obelix have ""NEW"" names! (example - Druid Getafix's name is 'Magigimix' in this book! ). However the illustration is exactly as the original. I found 2 more books with the same translation problem - Asterix and the Great Crossing and the Olympic games (both paperback). If you are serious fan do not buy these books."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"The Romans turn elsewhere for some invasion fun, Britain. These leaves Obelix very bored. Things perk up when Anticlimax, Asterix's British cousin, comes to visit. His village is the lone holdout in Britain.Getafix makes him a barrel of magic potion, and the boys offer to help him transport it. They also take with them a strange new herb Getafix has discovered."
5,A real surprise!,"Having met Mrs. Owens, I was suprised that she wrote a book about such dark things, but I enjoyed this book. She really captured the spirit of the people and the situation. Knowing some of the people the characters are based on, I could picture them in that situation. Although it's sad, dealing with the death of two children, it's a great book. I plan to read more of her books soon. Don't miss this one. It's great!"
2,A poor rehash of an interesting original text,"I agree with the majority of statements made by Ben Waugh. The core of this book is a several hundred year old document which was translated over 100 years ago and has been repackaged in garbage by Feral House publishing for this release. While the original document offers interesting perspective, Feral House's release in this publication does not contributed to it so much as it takes away from the document's essence.The additional doodles have nothing to do with historical Christian martyrdom, and some of them could only be described as disturbing and pornographic. The publisher's foreword is pretty blatantly anti-Church and makes one wonder what other purpose Feral House had to publish it than to revel in Christian suffering and make a buck off of it.I would recommend finding a used older edition which the publisher's ""bonus"" material was left out."
1,A Horror,No real Christian would ever own this book published by Feral House. This publisher hates Christianity. Avoid this book at all costs.
5,Great book on e-commerce,"The book is easy-to-read, pleasant and extremely complete. The chapters concerning safety and privacy through the Internet are carefully detailed but not too technical, and I think everybody will understand them; furthermore they deal with problem concerinig e-commerce in general, not only online travel services. The last part of the book dealing with how to stay online while travelling requires more computer knowledge, but the author promply warns the reader before getting into geeky technicalities, so that it is easy to skip the difficult pages. As the book deals with an ever-changing subjects, updates are available at the author's web site, and it is always possible to send an e-mail and ask for explanation if something is not clear. It helped me a lot understand the online travel marketplace and how to make my purchases online more wisely."
5,Great Boots....sized small,I have a previous pair of Thorogoods that I have worn for almost 4 years. The material and workmanship is awesome. Just remember to order 1 size larger than you normally would
5,Excelent 1-disc greatest hits collection,"The other reviewers are diappointed because these episodes have all been released in other collections. Personally, I'm not a SpongeBob completist, and I don't need rare unreleased episodes or limited-edition collector's figurines, I just want a few of the funniest shows.If you only want one DVD of this silly show, Absorbing Favorites is probably the one to get.This disc has all of my favorite episodes, including the emotional ""Ripped Pants"" (plus Ripped Pants karaoke!), the spectacular ""Fry Cook Games,"" the poignant ""Jellyfish Hunter,"" and the awesome ""Karate Choppers,"" plus a few more good ones. I don't know if the ""lost"" episode, ""The Sponge Who Could Fly,"" is really lost, but it is pretty funny. And the special features are all excellent.This might be all the SpongeBob a normal person needs.By the way, my kids (ages 7 and 4) love it too."
2,Spongebob Reruns,"Don't get me wrong, we LOVE SPongebob at our house but as the other reviewers have also stated the episodes on here have already been released on previous Spongebob DVD's. So why do they think we would buy something that we already have?"
2,No point in buying this really,"This DVD just has 9 episodes that are on other DVDs. it's just recycled ones so Nick can try and make a couple bucks. No need to buy this, just stick with the seasons if you're into them."
2,100% recycled material,All the episodes here were recycled from other DVDs. There's basically no point in buying this.
3,T2: The Future War,"While I liked the first two entries in this series, this one is weak. Stirling seems in a hurry to finish off the series and the great story line he began in ""Infiltrator"" and ""Rising Storm"" falls flat here.I assume the pressure of deadlines and a restricted amount of page space are to blame?...or perhaps the author had other projects that were more important?Its too bad that a strong series had to fininsh on this note."
2,Really?,"It's hard to believe that this is the same man who wrote March Through Georgia. That book was one of the best military scifi novels I've read. This book feels rushed, underdeveloped, and poorly researched. Sergeants in the SEALS? really?"
2,"Good series, but weak ending","""T2 The Future"" is the third book by S.M. Stirling. This books starts right before Judgement Day though years of battling the Skynet. While this might have be good idea for the third teminator movie, it just didn't work well for this series. The writer left many details that would have explain the action of his characters. I believe that Mr. Stirling could have given the characters more emotions, like he did in the first two books. Also since the book had alot on jumping in the future, its clear that the reader lost alot that could have made the book better. As I said before, this have been better if it was a movie and not a book."
1,"fabululously awful, and then just plain awful","So bad it's a blast to read. Jam packed with the author's political views, especially hilarious when they have nothing to do with the plot! There's nothing like giving book contracts to the mentally disturbed. Look out Vegans and environmentalists! You'll be target number one when Skynet rules, aparently. Also hilarous are the dropped characters and storylines, like the group of college students who have their own chapter to almost never be mentioned again. Also: There's a gas shortage! Don't waste gas! We have to get somewhere quickly for this plot twist, let's drive! And remember, if you disagree with Sterling's political views you are an ""idiot activist in an idiot cause,"" so there!"
5,Ballet music,Perfect for teaching. In the studio or home use. Not too much you can say other than it is ballet class music.
2,"spotty performance, poor service","i have had my sony laptop for only 3 1/2 years and use it as a home computer...checking email, some simple word document, powerpoint, etc. work. nothing strenuous and typically not for long periods of time. average about 1-3 hours a few days a week....and my motherboard just burnt out. this will be incredibly expensive to replace. just last year i had to have the motherboard reset because of a power issue. too expensive and it's ridiculous that they charge $30 to even talk to someone over the phone....definitely look elsewhere for your laptop"
2,"Cool-looking, but with flaws","My clear case did not come with a belt clip as promised, but a loop to pass a belt through. That's a big difference if you plan to just clip it on your shorts. Secondly, the case blocks you from using the hold button, and the iPod is constantly turning itself on in my bag and draining the battery. The Apple version of this, with the integrated headphones, sounds like a better option, especially because of accessibility to the hold button. But for the price difference, I guess I can't complain too much."
2,Too much static and background noise,"Bought the phone to use the mute feature (not very common anymore), but static and background noise is a little too distracting. Probably will return for a refund."
3,Somewhat Disappointing Phone,"I received my Uniden TRU341 2.4GHz Cordless Phone, and I am rather disappointed in it! I do like the way the handset sits upright in the base. That makes the phone easier to answer, and it looks neat. However, I already had a Uniden TRU241 2.4 GHz Cordless Phone with Caller ID, and I have always loved it. I thought Uniden was just about the best name when it comes to cordless phones. However, with my 341, the sound is not as clear, and there is somewhat of an echo. I am returning this phone, because it has failed to meet my expectations."
3,Baby Einstein: Baby Galileo,"My child liked the book and its colors but it ripped the first day we had it!! He is only 1 and ripped it along the page fold, so nice book, poorly constructed"
4,good companion to the DVD,"This book is pretty good. It goes along with the Baby Galileo DVD. It opens up to form a circle that your baby can sit in the middle of. One side has Baby Einstein pictures and a story, and the other side has real photos of planets and other things in the sky and universe. My daughter already had the Baby Neptune - Oceans book similar to this and liked that one much better, the pictures were more colorful and there was more to look at. She hasn't seemed too interested in this one though. I don't think there's enough pictures and interesting things to look at in this book. She's already 2 so maybe it's a better book for a 1-yr old."
3,"Great book, poorly made",This a great book. My daughter got it for her 1st bday and still plays with it at 2 and points out all the sea creatures. Gave it 3 stars only because I have had to repair it over and over. I finally taped up all the seams of the book in anticipation of them being torn apart. Wishing they would have reinforced them. Great idea though!
4,Good music to wind down,"I enjoyed the original piano music which is a combination of New Age, Jazz, and Classical. It is good music to listen to at the end of a difficult and trying or tiring day or just simply to wind down."
5,What a bargain!,"...Looking for a decent, reasonably priced unit in store is a joke, so don't waste your time. After looking on line, we took a chance on this unit, and have not regretted it. I am sure there are better systems out there, but you will pay an arm and a leg for them. This one does the job and was more than worth the money and trouble to order it on line.The only complaint we have is that the system will not allow you to control the speakers individually, but I am not sure that this is an option that any system gives you, so take that comment with a grain of salt. Other than that, the sound is great, the system is aesthetically pleasing, and if you already have a DVD player and don't need a system that includes one, this is a must purchase for you."
5,Incredible,"I feel that it is becoming more and more the case today that surf movies are just a way for companies like Billabong, Rip Curl, Globe, etc. to get their team out in the lime-light. They smear their logos all over the film and back it up with raging, lame, typical SoCal crappy whiteboy music, but A Brokedown Melody, like its predecessors creates a fantastical and complete surfing experience. There are no subtitles telling you who is surfing or who the song is by because it doesn't matter; the movie is too good for those details to make a difference. The movie is one whole journey that has calming and seductive overtones. This is BY FAR the best surf movie I have ever seen. It is an authentic documentation of what surfing truly is and what it should continue to be."
4,Real Good Set,I got to hear this Disc recently&truly enjoyed the elements of it.Level 42 Meets Mid 70's Paul Mccartney&Wings with a touch of Tears of Fears.I was truly digging the Overall Arrangements&instrumentation here.the Vocals are Cool.this is a Cool Set of Songs keep a Ear out for this Set.
3,"Good book, bad ending","I liked the book a lot in the beginning and in the middle, while the suspense was slowly building, but then I felt that everything just happened all at once and too sudden to be realistic. I found myself wondering, that's it? That's all? I feel it could have been a much better book if the author had taken more time to ""resolve"" the book."
2,Mediocre,"Out of all of Robert Cormier's books that I've read, In the Middle of the Night was probably the worst. It wasn't terrible, but it just didn't seem to have any meaning to me. It was pretty boring, and I wouldn't recommend it.Excuse me for my negative review, but I'm just being honest!"
1,In The Middle of The Night,"I didn't understand the way the book was written. I got completeley lost after reading the Prologue. I chose the book because the blurb sounded really interesting.Mabye I would of understood it better if I was a bit older, but then again I don't read alot of books!"
2,confusing plot,"in the middle of the night is complex and deals eith many different charecter changes. it is not as good as most cormier titles like the chocolate war, beyond the chocolate war, tunes for bears to dance to and i am the cheese."
2,Whatever,"Why did I read this? Because I was into teen romances at the time and assumed it must to be good. Did I enjoy it? No. Were the characters interesting? No. Did the book have any depth? No. I am, however, giving it two stars because I like the way the book is set up- in between chapters, they have little columns and emails for you to read- I liked how that broke the book up. Other than that, this book was not worth my time."
3,It's alright,"The pictures are OK. If you're a fan you can overlook the flaws and just enjoy the calendar, for it's main use."
1,Still charging full price in mid-March?!?!?,I'd really like to get this calendar for a Buffy fan I know...
3,"Nice, but not fantastic","My 9-year-old thought this a neat item when he opened it. The activity books contain your basic activities--dot-to-dot, mazes, hidden pictures, etc. The cup, however, is not very sturdy, and the top does not fit back on it at all. The pencil is cute with its topper. A great concept, but not very well thought out as to how well it will travel. Says it will fit in the cup holder, but it's not sturdy enough to stay there."
2,Not Worth The Money,"This cup once opened can't be reclosed. It is flimsy thin and the lid is disposeable. It contains about 9 cents worth of cheap paper. The little paperpad is rolled and will not straighten out. Save yourself and your child a big disappointment. Just purchase a small box of name brand crayons, a pencil and a 99 cent coloring book. They will enjoy it more."
5,Storyline ....,"Since Amazon hasn't posted an editorial review, here's the description from the back of the book to help you decide if this book is for you: ""With its jumble of grey wings and towers and teh river winding clear below ... into its dark and brooding halls comes Honor Thwaite ... bride of Richard Sawtrey. Now, Honor was mistress of the manor -- a house of terrible secrets that would not remain unspoken. Of Mrs. Anna, Richard's mother, who had murdered her stepson so that Richard could be heir. Of Richard, who had bedded the tavern wench and sired many bastards. Of Francis Wolffe, the Daneclere bailiff who would do anything to have his way. And of Honor herself. She had been warned to never again cross the ford to the Thwaite farm until a time of gravest trouble or danger. Now that time had come."" A great tale of historical, gothic suspense."
5,I thought it was for real.....,I read the book in Russian translation. Now I wonder if I could get it in English. I would like to know how much I missed reading the translated version....
3,Predictable,"This book was a decent summer read, but it was so predictable. The end justifies the means seems to be the message and I disagree. The good are too good and the bad too bad. I don't believe everything is this black and white."
3,Different,I like this book it was a span of many years but yet she carried so much anger for so long it got depressing. Not sure where the rest will go....
3,Butterfly Trilogy,I just could not get into this book. Women should never be portrayed as this desparate. Did not finish it.
4,Very good book,"I enjoyed this book very much. It's the first one I have read of the Butterfly Trilogy, and I plan to read others as time goes on. It had all of the elements: sex, mystery, and a good storyline without too much unneeded detail. The book kept me wondering what was going to come next and what was ultimately going to happen."
4,Story about the metamorphosis of women,"Butterflyby Katherine Harvey is a very entertaining read. I loved following the development of various female characters from women with little self-worth to fully integrated women. For some, vengeance is the catalyst; for others, it is the acceptance of self, with all its imperfections. Very tastefully, Harvey attributes this acceptance to having good sex with a partner whose desire is to please rather than be pleased. What woman cannot relate to that!But Butterfly is more than titillating. The characters are richly developed. The plot, entwined with mystery and secretiveness, keeps the reader guessing what will happen next, and, at the end of the novel, wanting to know what happened to the beloved characters. Fortunately, Butterfly is the first book in the trilogy. I can't wait to see what happens to the characters in the subsequent books."
5,this book was excellent,"butterfly is a must read book. i found that once i started reading the book, i could not put it down. there is also a sequel to this book *stars* which is also excellent. must read"
5,Absolutely Brilliant!!,"I have read this book four times and I thouroughly enjoyed it each and every time. It is the epitomy of love, lust, revenge and power. Danny deserved what he got. It is simply the best, More by Ms Harvey would be greatly appreciated!"
3,not what I expected,"Kind of dissapointed. This was an O.k. read but very predictable. It took me alot longer to finish this book than usual. For a woman to spend her entire life seeking revenge against a man who betrayed her is rediculous. SPOILER AHEAD: And then for the group of friends who were closer than most people would ever be in life to be seperated permanently, and by choice, at the end was horrible."
2,pttttht :op,"Overall, I thought this was kind of a dumb book. I guess for a purely recreational read there is some escapism value to it, and the writing isn't terrible. The story keeps you moving along, but is completely unbelievable. The double premise (a) a woman so bent on revenge that she spends her entire life with only that purpose, and (b) a fabulously successful house of male prostitution/female fantasy fulfillment, is pretty far-fetched. Especially silly is the idea that women would find such a thing therapeutic. Some of the members of my bookclub really enjoyed this one, but I have to say that it was one that I'm sure I won't care to read again - add it to the ""trade"" bag."
5,A must for your library,"Butterfly is the best book I have ever read in my life. It is a definite keeper. I've purchased nearly 5 copies of this book to give as gifts. Kathryn Harvey is a literary genius. I actually applauded after reading the last page. This book has so many twists and turns, but is written in a way that keeps you right there hanging on. Every woman I know who has read this book, wants membership to the club. When I suggest Butterfly to them, I sit back and await the ""Oh My Gosh"" phone call that is expected. Both this and the sequel 'Star' are inspirational pieces of literature. I am torn with wanting to see this as a movie or just keeping it as the written masterpiece that it is."
4,Very intriguing and interesting.,I found Butterfly to be a fascinating book. Ms. Harvey displays all of her talents as a writer in writing this work of art. Butterfly revolves around powerful women who have a true desire for revenge for those that did them wrong in the past. I think Butterfly is an awesome book and I could not put it down.
5,Loved this book!!!,I loved this book!!! Great read!!! It had mutiple stories that tied together really well. Amazing ending too!!! You will enjoy it.
5,Butterfly,Butterfly was terrific! I was interested right from the beginning. I couldn't put it down! Definitely a great book for sentimental women. I can't wait to read Stars!
5,"Great book, if you read this you have to read Stars as well.",Katherine Harvey does a great job of providing closure in regards to her characters. This (and Stars) are great books if you want to escape into another world and really become part of it. She leaves you wanting updates on the characters. You gotta read it
5,A really fun read!,"This is a really fun book if you're looking for light reading which doesn't demand full engagement of your intellect. The story unfolds in an interesting way and it's easy to read either in big chunks or just a little at a time. Read it! Then go pick up the sequel... ""Stars""! Hahaha - absolutely fabulous, cheesy-1980's silly reading!"
5,My favorite book for over 10 years!!,First read this book when I was a teenager and it was my favorite book back then. I picked it up 2 days ago just to remember what I liked so much and I not once put it down (difficult with 3 kids under 3 but I managed). Still my all time favorite book (and I read a lot) and I'm 28. A must read!!!! Enjoy every minute of her revenge :) I wish they would make a movie!!
4,The best book I have ever read!,This is a book you would not want to put down. It raptures your emotions to the point that vendication is not a bad word. It sends a stong message to anyone that you can succeed regardless and watch out to those that try to tear you down. A must read for all!
5,a great read,This was a book I could not put down. I loved the ending although I wished the book went on for longer.
5,The best book I have ever read!,"This book has everything- sex, revenge, mystery. This is my all time favorite book. I have gotten all of my friends to read it and they feel the same. A must read!"
4,Product received as advertised,"The product was received in the condition as advertised and was delivered in a timely manner, well within pre-conceived expectations. This item was purchased as a gift and therefore has not been viewed by me."
5,Season 1: NCIS = New Cast is Superb!!,"This is the one that started it all. Every time I go back and watch the seasons in order, I never cease to be amazed at the superb quality of season one. This show did not have to find itself or seek out a niche. It hit the ground running and never looked back.The first couple of seasons slowly developed a faithful viewing audience, and by year three, the show was becoming a big deal. This set will show you why NCIS is still the number one drama on television!I recommend this to people who love police shows, to people who like a slightly quirky cast, to military personnel, especially Navy and Marines. I would recommend this to anyone who loves a great ensemble cast with a strong lead.There truly is something for everyone."
5,NCIS Rocks,"I generally don't love CSI type of show. Kind of boring and too serious. But NCIS is a real surprise. The magic is in the cast, and the humour. Beside it is uniquely different from the rest of the same genre. I have heard some comments that the show is too predictable. But hey! It still is loved by many, so they have done something right."
5,Terrific buy!,"This is one of the best buys I've ever made on Amazon. The shows are great, it's the one season I missed."
4,Addiction Acquired,"Love this series! Cast ensemble is perfection, and Mark Harmon as Gibbs is just sublime. The stories and situations and the facts (Ducky's as well as Abby's) are always a high point for me. My husband is now addicted and has watched the first two seasons at least twice through each. My only problem with the DVDs is that there is no closed captioning, so that my husband can follow the dialogue easier (he's hard of hearing). But other than that, we love the humor, thought, and incredible writing that goes into this series."
4,Great crime show..,with lots of drama. It can be watched by the whole family with some caution to a couple of the beginning scenes. Interesting stories brought to the television screen. The actors are perfect for their rolls.
5,NCIS - Season 1,"I have been waiting for this series to be released on DVD. I finally got it.Can't wait for the next season. Quality of the product is excellentThe shows are packaged two per DVD with all episodes in the six DVD set. There is an excellent Special Features episode also. Great series, great characters. Well worth the money."
5,Love NCIS,This series is great. Kudos to the creator. Getting the season's shows on DVD made them even more enjoyable ... no ads.
5,"Great 1st season, action packed, great acting-loved it!","I have to admit I got hooked on this show a little while ago, but had only seen 1 episode first hand from this specific season. I thought it was great, there's so many episodes for it being the first season, because I've bought other shows on DVD and the last one I got there were only 6 episodes...this one has 23 episodes in all, and I love the behind the scenes stuff they throw in too.There were a few episodes I liked in particular in this season because they didn't follow the usual story line, and really kept you guessing or they had a cool twist to them.The characters are great, and I love the visuals in this show. It's all very well thought out."
2,duplicated discs,"My set had 2 disc 1's, and no disc 2. Very frustrating to miss the entire disc 2 episodes."
2,"Not great, not bad","NCIS isn't going to be winning any awards any time soon. It's generally unoriginal, and the acting and writing are subpar.That being said, it's not a bad series. It is what it is."
3,"Annoying characters, but great mysteries",Often I wanted to fast forward through lame banter between the male and female sidekicks who love to hate each other. It's a shame that cuts into really good mysteries.
2,Ncis-4 stars. DVD-2,"The show is great, the DVD not so much. No closed captioning. My wife is hard of hearing and enjoys shows with closed captioning."
3,A little bit above average,"This is a C grade movie and will entertain you. However, dont expect any blockbuster scenes from this movie. Most of the fake scenes are noticable but the suspence and the storyline will keep you watching till the end. As stated, some ofthe actors are not enpare with the main character, meaning their acting seems too forced and amateur. However the main character does a great job and it is a pity that he had to be stuck with this low budget movie. For those of you who enjoy the end of the world themes, this is a great one because it will show what it is like if earth was in an ice age. Unlike The Day After Tomorow, the bitter cold will be shown in several different locations from top of skyscrappers to what it's like living underground. In an enviromental perspective, it will dig a bit more. Worth a rental and a first time watch but I hardly consider this a keeper or to watch it a second time just for kicks when there are so many movies already out there."
2,Horrible!,"This ""film"" (and I use that term loosely) is horrible. The script / timeline is broken, the effects are third rate and any resemblance to reality is a mistake. When Cain leaves his family standing there, that was it for me. I bought this for $3.00 and I paid too much."
1,Disk works best as a coaster.,"This movie is so bad you would be better off ordering this to replace your Frisbee or use as a coaster. I rarely want to go to my garage and get the hammer out to bash my DVD's, but this one did the trick. I couldn't think of reselling this to some other unsuspecting soul."
1,HORRIBLE,This movie is horrible. Special effects are so bad I could have dont them better from my home computer and the acting sucks too.
1,Another Disaster (of acting) Movie. Ha! Ha!,"Comedic, laughable, bush league, is just a few words that best describe this flop. Activate ""subtitles"" because some of the ""foreign"" actors are unintelligible (it was made in Europe, but they're still foreign to me). You'll honestly think you're watching a parody of a disaster movie produced by Weird Al Yankovic. The opening music must have been taken from your stock disaster movies from the past. Like AIRPLANE. But I digress.Want to laugh at a really bad movie that would illicit a ""Worst Actor"" nomination to Dean Cain? This is it. Cheaply made, terribly scripted, badly acted, ridiculous premise (aren't all disaster movies?).If you can exercise, read a book, surf the Web, and eat a meal while watching this amateur film project, you deserve an OSCAR."
4,Solid B-Movie,"From a first look 'Post Impact' might appear as a cheap imitation of 'The Day After Tomorrow.'While it contains elements from 'The Day After Tomorrow' it's an entirely different movie and in some aspects better than 'The Day After Tomorrow.'The movie's CGI and Special Effects are by 'Hollywood' standards 'B' but in terms of storyline I found it superior than 'The Day After Tomorrow.'It's a good European production that had a strong element of realism and wasn't strung together either by 'ooh' and 'aah' explosions, excessive sex or violence or mind numbing amount of sepcial effects and CGI.I recommend to everyone to watch 'The Day After Tomorrow' and then watch 'Post Impact' and compare the two, you might be surprised.Thank you for your time and I give inspirational and written credit to the poster before me who expressed his/her opinion about the misconception that 'Post Impact' is a 'cheap' imitation of 'The Day After Tomorrow.'"
5,Post impact,"I would give out the background story on this movie, but seeing as quite a few reviews beat me to it already, I would only be wasting time in telling how the movie went because it was very accurate on the storyline as the movie played, so I'll tell you what I feel about the movie in general.I watched this movie on the Sci-Fi channel a couple of years back, thought it was brilliant, but sad, and kinda lost touch of the movie afterwards until now. I think the movie deserved a lot more than the low-star reviews it received, considering the battle-action scenes and the scene with snow in the North African desert. Dean Cain is excellent in this movie! Another great movie added to my collection. Five stars all the way! You have to buy this to believe it."
3,Made For TV Movie Quality Film,"I'm a big fan of Disaster films, so when I saw ""Post Impact"" at the video store I decided to check it out. The premise of Post Impact is pretty much the same'ol same'ol. A gigantic comet is about to collide with earth, drastically altering the Earth's climate. An obscure scientific project headed by heavily accented Germans(this time a satellite controlled ""Microwave"" ray-gun), is used to try to deflect the comet. Unfortunately, the ray-gun is unsuccessful, plunging Earth into a new Ice Age.Despite some rather cheesy CGI (the snow tanks), and some bad acting (primarily on the part of the British agent, and the scientists), I rather liked Post Impact. Dean Cain when not sporting a beard isn't too hard on the eyes, and the plot was entertaining, if a bit far-fetched.I give this film 3 stars. If it weren't for a really sappy ending and some uninspired sets, it might've been great."
4,Santa Baby 2 movie,My son collects Christmas movies and this was an addition to his collection. He's happy w/this movie since Jenny is a favorite actress/model of his.
1,Seriously?,"I loved Santa Baby 1. It was a good Christmas flick. I don't know what happened here. No offense. The actors were great. They were just the wrong actors. If they could have stuck with the original cast it would have been much better. I ordered this on Amazon, and found it on Netflix to view for free. I started watching it, 20 minutes later decided I had made an ""accidental"" purchase. Sending it back."
3,think the first was better,"i enjoyed the scenery in these movies, and santas home. i think the first movie was better, but if you are a mccarthy fan, you will like it."
4,Entertaining Christmas story,"I've seen it before, but it never gets old. Unlike in Santa Baby, Terry is helping Mary and Santa this year, but what could go wrong? I don't want to give away the story, so watch how Christmas almost is lost but is eventually saved..."
5,Tracing Your Ancestry Made Easy!,"Roots Recovered is not only a practical travel guide, but also a valuable guide for tracing African-American ancestry! The resources and references in this book are extensive and the writers have traveled to these places--making it a treasure trove of information. The traveler can trace one's roots to specific African tribes. The book contains bits of history and is informative, as well as educational and helps Blacks with the misrepresentations about Africa. As a bonus, the reader learns how to travel for free or on a budget. I especially enjoyed these sections: useful phrases, watch you back, women travelers, photography etiquette and places of interest (not your ordinary ones). This book is a must read for anyone planning to travel to Africa."
4,good resource book,"I really like this book. The resources and references are fantastic and the author proves that he knows what he is talking about. His experiences were exciting, genuwine and informative. In addition there are individual chapters on various West African countries and what you might expect during your visits, plus great information on embassy offices, cheap air seats and safety. A must have for the traveler."
5,A most educational and enlightening book,"This thought provoking and sometimes shocking book came highly recommended and I pass on the same sentiments. Though always interested in expanding my consciousness, I was little prepared for the giant leap I would take with each page. Susie Bright speaks intelligently from personal experience about such topics as pornography, gender, and sexuality. She provides the reader with radical yet believable interpretations that make you want to go out and explore for yourself. She brings together the human experience to which we are born, with the secret desires and fantasies we all possess, slowly unveiling the masks we hide behind. A must read if you are ready to explore your own sexual identity and biases."
4,Smells great and keeps lips moisturized.,"This lip gloss smells great and does a great job of keeping your lips moisturized, especially in the winter. I only wish it had a little more gloss to it. When you are wearing this lip gloss it looks like you are wearing normal chap stik. I also wish it came in a tube instead of in a small jar."
4,Transitional bed works great,"We bought this bed thinking that our daughter would enjoy sleeping in it. This has worked. I found that you might need to stuff some towels between the gap of the mattress and bed frame. My daughter got her foot stuck while playing aroundOn shipping you will need to keep on top of Ceva (shipper), they will eventually call to set a time to deliver. I ended up driving to their center and picked up the product myself. Amazon has the manufacturer drop ship the item at time of purchase to avoid inventory. We received the wrong item. Make sure prior to signing the item that you are getting what you ordered."
4,Charming and Witty,"Chasing the 400 is an entertaining read. Vera, the book's cheeky protagonist, visualizes a life of unrestrained opportunity and excitement after graduating from high school and sets out to claim her newly gained independence with determined and enthusiastic resolve. The book absorbs you in eager anticipation as Vera's destiny unfolds. This is a perfect piece of escapism for summer reading or a morning commute."
5,Refreshing,"Finally, a book that is not about gangsters, drugs and the ""typical"" urban life. This book was refreshing and a quick read. I was looking for a book that was different and presented African American's in a different light and i found it. Her writing reminds me of Diane McKinney-Whetstone when she first arrived on the scene. I definately am looking forward to a sequel as it seems to have been set up for one in the end. I'll keep checking in to see if she come out with one."
2,Not For Me,"Not my cup of tea, but that's just speaking for me. Others may like it a lot. Some books appeal, some don't."
5,Big Surf = Big Wave Guitar,"One of my favorite instrumental surf compilations. As mentioned, the bands were from the Del-Fi label. While Big Surf was produced by Ace Records, a later release called Big Surf II on the Del-Fi label was with pretty much the same songs. At this review writing it is still available at a decent price point.Anyway, if you like vintage instrumental surf, this is a must have release."
4,Great Book!,"Very easy for Twi beginners to pick up the grammar, very good for Twi speakers to learn how to write Twi.The book is not the best for learning pronounciations (like most language books), readers might need some audio material to accompany it or already have some concept of the sounds in Akan Twi."
2,An Avid Reader,"Due to my insatiable reading appetite, I read over 50 books per year. I enjoy a bit of non-fiction, but for the most part I read fiction. This book reads as predicably as a typical genre historical romance novel. It is very light reading with very little depth to the characters or storyline and written with an elementary vocabulary. Over all, I found the book to be a disappointment."
5,A short-story collection that made me FEEL!,"I have read many great short-story collections, but this one is the best I have read in a very long time. A Bit on the Side showcases several of the darkest, bleakest, most thought provoking and haunting short stories out there. William Trevor has delved into human emotion in a way that most short-story writers aren't able to convey in a few pages. Some of the stories touched me, others disturbed me. And that is what I love about this collection. Trevor made me FEEL for the characters. A book is definitely a keeper when the language is so palpable it almost jumps out of the pages. My favorite stories are ""Sitting with the Dead,"" ""Justina's Priest,"" ""Traditions,"" and ""A Bit on the Side."" I haven't read Trevor's previous efforts, but I will definitely give them a whirl. I cannot recommend A Bit on the Side: Stories enough."
1,boring,this book was painfully boring....no beginning and no end in any of the short stories. I would not recemmend this book.
4,The Curator of the Quiet Masterpiece,"William Trevor's brilliant stories reached their peak with the collections ""After Rain"" (1996) and ""The Hill Bachelors"" (2000), and he goes far in this newest collection to remind us why the short story often packs a defter punch than the novel. The title characters in ""Justina's Priest"" wage the most heartbreaking of battles in a timeless tale of the world moving forward.However, I found Trevor's syntax to be unnecessarily cluttered as never before. Each story has sentences that are written in the most wrapped around manner, and are done so without their own reward. This is a minor complaint, but enough to keep this collection at four stars."
5,Superp Deal,"Best dealA complete system, the sleek TH-A10 provides all the functions of a room full of separate components -- without tangles of wires and confusing operation. An all-in-one center unit combines a DVD-Video/VCD/CD player and an FM/AM tuner, along with a full slate of inputs and outputs. The robust 200 watt amplifier is built into the powered subwoofer and connects to the center unit with just one cable. Five full-range satellite speakers meter theater-quality sound accurately throughout the listening field. Ease of installation is ensured by single wire connections and color-coded speaker cables. For easy operation, the TH-A10 provides auto-power-on and auto-speaker settings. The system even comes with two remote controls - a full-function multi-brand and a simple type. So what are you waiting for. Go ahead, and turn your boring living room into an exciting home theater, complete with heart-pounding Dolby Digital sound and razor-sharp DVD images.WoW worth the money"
5,Not your everyday Hollywood flick,"Before you buy, let's get one thing straight. You can trully ""get it"" if you lived in the former Soviet Union. This doesn't mean you won't be able to enjoy this thoroughly, but there are certain cultural idioms that one cannot translate. That said prepare for one fast action packed movie. The plot is not hard to follow ... be prepared for non-PC slang and actions.All in all I absolutely love this movie. Buy it, as you may not get it the first time around."
5,Amazing!))))),"I love this movie, I watch it all the time. It really is too bad the lead actor is dead((((((( I highly recommend this movie (and brat 1), to those who love Russian movies, like myself."
1,deadly boring,"I do not recommend this product to anyone. Had I known what it was like, I would not have purchased it. I think it is far too boring for anyone to realistically pursue to help their memory, despite whatever evidence there may be to show its effectiveness."
2,Boring,"The benefits may be great, but the exercises are so boring that it is way too much effort to do them on a regular basis."
2,Ouch! My Brain Hurts!,Comment made by the user after about 30 minutes. Begged me never to make him use it again.
3,A decent read,"If you're looking for a book with a decent telling of the war in the Pacific during World War II, this one should work for you. There are several first-hand accounts of combat and such, which are woven into a narrative history of the war. Some chapters have more personal accounts than others, and some of the accounts don't add very much in my opinion.My problem with this book is what appears to be very poor proof-reading on the part of the either the publisher or the author(s). For instance, on two maps the islands of Sumatra and Java are incorrectly identified. Several ships are identified incorrectly, and one, the USS Saratoga, is mistakenly identified as being sunk (it survived the war and was sunk during the atomic bomb tests in 1946). Maybe I'm just nit-picking, but these kinds of errors really annoy me and detract from the reading experience."
3,not what i ordered,"i like the blanket but it wasnt the color i ordered. in the picture its all brown and my bedroom is brown and black but when i got the blanket, it had alot of green in it. i rate it 3 stars because the quality of the blanket was nice but it wasnt the color i wanted"
4,Excellent quality,"I have had my Kettler Astro for several years and use it all the time. The reason I chose this machine is that it has ball bearings in all the pivot points versus bushings in most other ellipticals. The bushings wear out and the machines usually start knocking and get noisy after a few months. My Kettler is still quiet even after many years of continuous use.The only down side to this machine, is that if you are very tall, it is a bit small. I am 6'3"" and have to stand about 2 inches back from the front of the foot pedals or my knee may contact the front brace occasionally. Other than that, it is perfect, and I would buy another Kettler again without hesitation.No fancy programs, you set the tension and start exercising, but that is perfect for me. Gives a great cardio workout and whole body exercise, with no impact on your joints. This machine should last a lifetime."
1,DRM = Bad,This disc has some sort of DRM which won't allow it to be ripped to iTunes and therefore is useless as who even owns a CD player anymore?
5,Excellent Atari real games,"Wow, when I start the PS2 with this game is just amazing remember about a lot years ago when I play on Atari console, the execution of the games are full screen, and I bonus you'll find the real cartdriges images like was Atari old cassettes, machines and included a video from the creator of Atari. If you want to play again the Atari's games you have to get this. I bought here at amazon.com and in just 2 days can play."
4,The games that started it all...,"Remember the days when you'd wait on line in the arcade to play those early classics like Asteroids and Missle Command? Do you know all the secret warps in (one of my all-time faves) Crystal Castles? Did your mind become a steel trap when doing your best to kill that Centipede? If so, this is the collection for you: 18 arcade originals, plus a whopping 80 titles from the Atari VCS, including home versions of most of those same arcade titles...while the VCS compilation didn't do much for me, not having jumped on the home system bandwagon until the late 80s, it's still fun if you wanna see how much technology has improved in the last 25+ years, yet these first home video games w/their simple graphics and SFX were once considered state-of-the-art(!). All told, it's a great find for anyone who wants a firsthand look at the genre's first true ""Golden Age""."
5,GREAT NESTALGIA,Made me feel young again! Just like the games I played wiyh my son when he was young! Great buy!
3,Old school memories,"Just as I remember them. My dad was a cutting edge kind of guy when it came to electronics, so we had one of the first gaming consoles, one of the first laser disc players, etc... So when I saw this selection I was somewhat hesitant, but took the chance. Not disappointed at all. The renderings are true to form and defintely bring back fond memories of my teen years."
3,Great value for nostalgia freaks,"Atari Anthology offers up 85 (yes, 85) games from the console glory days of Atari. There's plenty of games you'll no doubt remember like Pong, Missle Command, Centipede, Asteroids, Yars' Revenge, and plenty of others to boot. There's also some games you may not remember like Double Dunk, Backgammon, and Atari Adventure; so for this compilation's price tag alone, you are getting a great value. That being said though, not all the games are perfect emulations. There are noticible differences in terms of sound effects and graphical glitches that occur now and then that were never prevelant before, but besides that and some control issues, most of the games play like they did back then. Other than that, if you weren't around back in Atari's glory days, there's really no reason to give Atari Anthology a look unless you want to check out some video game heritage, but for those who have fond memories of these games, this is an awesome pickup."
1,Don't even think about buying it,Don't even think about buying it. Even if you were addicted to Atari when you're kid you would find boring playing with your PS and LCD TV.
1,Very Disappointing,I was so excited to get this game! I was all nostalgic about my own video games as a child and wanted to get it to share with my son but it was awful! My son was not interested at all and it was hard to maneuver the ships etc. We were both disappointed...Please get something else....
2,"Rose-colored glasses for some, rose colored stop light for me.","The Atari 2600 was a great system. Atari was a great company, almost unquestionably the most important in turning video games into commonplace items. There are some games for the Atari 2600 that, true to their old school arcade roots, are all about challenging, addicting game play. Atari developed very few of these. This could have been a great collection if they had also snatched up the rights to excellent third party games like Reactor and Solar Fox, but instead you're mainly left wondering where those nostalgic feelings for Circus Atari came from. Two Stars, one for the Swordquest comic, and the second because Tempest is still incredible. Go buy the Activision collection instead."
3,Carefull with this one,"There were many complaints about the pc version. The Xbox version is messed up too. The one game I wanted,Red Baron,dosen't work at all on the computer and on Xbox it messes up if you turn to hard. The tanks and obsticles in Battlezone are black against a black background. The Xbox sound effects don't sound quite right either. And still no 2600 Basketball."
5,Exactly what I was looking for!,"I had finished piecing my first crazy quilt and only knew about two embroidery stitches with which to embellish it...of all the books that said they were ""the one"" I chose this one, and it was PERFECT. Each stitch, no matter how complex, is broken down into simple stitches and explained, so not only did I add feather stitches, I made vines and flowers and butterflies! This book is perfect for the beginner who wants her project to look like she's not a beginner!"
4,I love looking through this book,I love to get ideas from the first few pages that show all the stitches in one place. I've learned lots of new stitches that have looked great. The drawings make it easier to see where the needle should go. I wasn't disappointed.
2,I was most let down with this book,"the motifs, embellishments and stitches were great but for the price I felt quite let down with the inside of the book.it would have been nice to see more.there have been other books with a lot more work and color but cheaper than this bookbut great cover! please dont be offended"
5,An Encyclopedia of Crazy Quilt Stitches and Motifs,"This book is exactly what its title says, an encyclopedia. Pictures are clear, instructions easy to understand. It was just what I was looking for."
5,Very good ideas,"I am a begginner in crazy quilt, and this book helps me how to start and do a project. Very good."
5,Encyclopedia of Crazy Quilt Stitches,"Everyone needs this book, it goes along with any quilt book...the instructions are easy to work out..I love it."
3,Encycloopedia of Crazy Quilt Stitches,"This is a wonderful soft covered book full of different kinds of embroidery stitches for those who love to hand sew. I bought the book for my daughter who loves my book and is always borrowing it. However, the book was supposed to be new. It had slightly worn edges and a bit of a tear on the spine. So I was disappointed as it's a birthday gift."
4,Tammy in WI,"The cardboard boxes are easy to assemble and you don't have to worry about your children getting hurt by them. My 2 year old just likes to knock them down all the time. I think they are better for 3 year olds and up. My daughter doesn't play with them because of my younger son always knocking them down. It has potential of creative play. This set is perfect, no need to buy another one like I did. If you do, try to stick with the large blocks only, because the little ones are more of a nuisance. A few little ones are fine, can pretend that they are car ports, etc."
3,Edushape Corrugated Blocks - 84,"I didn't realize when I bought this that they come unassembled! It took quick awhile to put together 84 blocks. But it is a fun toy for the kids and they can do many, many things with them."
2,not enough happen,"the actors did not have a chemestry even though they were both very nice looking, it was a nice idea not enough going on to make the movie great."
4,Akira's Hip Hop Shop Short Film,I think it was a very pleasant film. I enjoyed it very much.I wished it were longer. It is a film everyone should see.Love sees no color.
5,Amazingness,OMG OMG!!! This is amazing i love AM/BW stories there are just not enough of them and I can't believe it ended to early : ( made me so sad but I watch it all the time so it's well worth the watch : ) I wish more asian men and black women would stop being so scared to be with one another my husband is asian and i am black and our son is just handsome everyone says he will be a heart-breaker lord hopefully not but just saying watch this movie you will love it unless you are a person who has to find something wrong with everything but if you can sit relax and enjoy perfect movie try it out.
4,Wanted more of a story!,"Was so anxious to see this movie, but the ending was flat I felt the writer and director had more to say but ran out of money? Or I hope that was it, really good young actors and this will become more of a story with the World becoming more globally aware of different cultures.Also it brought up a lot of the reality which is family continuity and family background is very important to the Asian community. Also most of these relationships might be very short and painful if you are expecting long commitment or marriage. Think hard about the consequences."
4,great little short film,"I caught bits and parts of this short film on TV (BET's Lens on Talent program, I think) and decided to buy the film. It was a nice little story. The only negative was the quality of the DVD itself--it skipped and paused in a few places even though it was brand new."
4,could be longer,"hey everyone,a few days i pruchased that movie. and i did like it. the only thing i disliked about the movie was the fact that it was only 37min or so long. when you are watching it you long for more. but other than that it's good and funny to see all of those cliché's."
2,Akirahiphopshop,"I'm glad the shipment was timely, but more than that, I'm glad the DVD didn't turn out to be a pirated copy from a 3rd party. I had that experience a few years ago, ordering a box set of Inuyasha from here.Only one of the discs would play, the rest were useless."
3,Falls a little flat,"The music in this Arkenstone collection is good, but not great. He instrumental pieces don't achieve ""sweeping"", more ""flying around"". The slow ""vocal"" ones also fall flat, missing etherial but hitting pretty. All in all, it's nice to listen to, but not moving. If you're expecting an Arkenstone collection with a strong theme or story, as some of his other work has provided, you won't find it here. I wouldn't throw it out, but I'd try listening to it at the library first before purchasing."
3,some very good and some forgettable,A mixture. Depends on what you like. There are some very nice Celtic tracks here and too many that feel to me less Celtic than nondescript dreamy new age.
1,"Skips, sometimes doesn't play - DON' T BUY THIS PRODUCT","The cd player worked fine for about 30 minutes (of course, right after I loaded all 200 discs in it). After that, it started skipping horribly. Sometimes it would play as expected, but that was rare. It would go into a permanent fast-forward mode and it would not play normally. Sometimes it would be okay as long as it was in full random mode, but as soon as I tried to play just one cd all the way through, it acted as if it were possessed. I'm in the process of returning this player. Save yourself the trouble - don't buy it!!"
1,WORTH IT'S WEIGHT IN DOG CRAP.,"I bought this player about a month ago & it worked fine for about a week. Brand new CDs started skipping for no reason & at different times during repeated play. Many times it would just skip the first 40 seconds of a song then play normally. I returned it for a replacment.A ""new"" one arrived & when I hooked it up it even refused to turn on at first. When I finally got it running it started acting possesed, for a minute I thought I was in Maximum Overdrive. It went into random disc mode for no reason, refused to play anything, & then finally shut down with a cryptic ""15"" the only thing shown on the display. Needless to say I am returning it as we speak, this time for a refund. Obviously JVC is seriously lacking in quality, perhaps this accounts for the low price. If you want to needlessly waste your time & money, buy this cd-changer. Otherwise look elsewhere."
1,Do not buy this Product - skips all the time,"I wish I had read all the reviews before I purchased this unit. I have two and both skip all the time. Very intermittant. Sent one to the factory 3 times. First one never worked from the beginning. Factory kept the unit for several weeks, and then UPS damaged it during shipping.I will try to get service one more time, and then off to EBAY. I will NEVER purchase another JVC product. Going to PIONEER."
3,Some suggested improvements,"The visual display is far too small. I'd like to be able to read the number of the CD and cut that's playing. If I want to know, I have to get up & get closer than 4 feet away. There should also be a way to choose by musical category so I could just play random rock or R&B or C&W or jazz cuts only. My previous player from the mid-90's had that. Otherwise, it works just fine. For those of us with big music collections, the binder is not helpful - I would suggest just creating a simple Excel spreadsheet with columns for disc #, artist name & CD name."
5,JVC CD Player,"The first CD player you sent did not work and you responded very quickly to get us a replacement within a couple of days. We returned the first one for credit and got a confirmation e-mail that you had received it. Overall, the purchase was a very positive experience. It was the first time I purchased anything from your company and it was handled very well and in a timely manner.Thanks!!"
3,"decent overview, but thin on details","I was looking for an intro to CMSes, and found this book only somewhat helpful. It was full of general advice like ""make sure to watch out for this issue"", but lacking concrete stories to ground the discussion.Maybe I was reading an older edition, but it seemed dated. There was some discussion of Netscape 4.7 or some other now-irrelevant browser, and I don't remember anything about the product Drupal."
4,72 Hour Emergency Food,"Well, i haven't tried this food yet. I bought it for my bug out bag and item was as described and came in 2 serving pouches for the entree""s. Single serving for breakfast items."
4,emergency foods,I received what I expected. The food is good and stores well. I will buy this product again as I have in the past.
4,Tasty but salty.,"I bought this for an emergency kit, and I decided to try out the chicken pack. Inside the bag I saw some dried veggies, rice, and some yellow powdery stuff which all looked very similar to those Cup of Noodles that we all used to eat in college. Basically, you pour hot water directly into the bag and let it sit for a while.My initial bite tasted good but it was too salty (hence the four stars). I then removed half of the liquid and poured more hot water in to dilute the salt/seasoning. The second tasting was actually very good. This is definitely not gourmet style food, but it was much better than fast food dining.I would probably recommend packing a spaghetti noodle stainer in your emergency kit to remove some of the salt/seasoning before eating. Too much salt intake will make you thirsty and limited water supply is usually a problem during an emergency."
4,Exactly what I expected,This product delivers as advertised. The packets pack small and light for my emergency supply bag and provide nice variety. Pretty much the only way to improve this is to include Beef stew. That's probably my favorite Mountain House product and is conspicuously absent here.
3,dont forget the water,Works as advertised tasted good and easy to use. But you must remember to have water supply and hear source if you want a hot meal. This does not contain either.
3,Misleading description,"Though my shipment was missing some items, I contacted ""JD PowerSellers"" and they were apologetic. It appears that vendors 'link' up to the product without necessarily being aware of the full description. I give it 3 stars for the 'misleading' advertisement. You only get 9, not 12, items. Since were talking about Mountain House, it's top of the line, 5 stars, so you should have no problems with the actual product. And, as I've mentioned, if you're dealing with ""JD PowerSellers"" as your vendor, they're not necessarily to blame for the mix-up; their customer service gets a 5. In summary: buyer beware, but not on account of Mountain House or JD PowerSellers."
3,Rethink the 72 hour food cache.,"Think about it. Three days.Sure, having some nice freeze-dried expensive backpacker food would be swell, even though you'll need some extra water and something to heat the water with.But - think about it.There's no reason at all why anyone older than infancy can't live for three days on just plain crackers and water. Add a bottle of vitamin pills if that worries you, but vitamin deficiency diseases like scurvy take much longer than three days to become serious. Mom can provide the best infant food the natural way (if not, add some packets of dried milk and mix it with crushed crackers and water).A store of good water is more important. Get a bunch of boxes of saltine-type crackers and store up three or more gallons of water per person and forget the commercial survival food."
2,Only if you aren't really hungry,"Although the food quality is decent - and the packages should last for a while, it's a bit deceptive to say that a TOTAL of about 2500 calories is adequate for a person for three days. Unless you're on a really tight diet. For a short term like 72 hours simply keep some canned food around (or some MRE's) and you'd do much better. If you insist on camping (dehydrated) food - simply buy a few of the real meals from this company. At least you'll be eating enough to keep the stomach rumbles down."
3,earthquake planner,"I bought this to include in my own earthquake preparedness kit because it has a 7 year shelf life. However, when I received it....it must have already been sitting on the Amazon warehouse shelf for a couple of years. The package has a ""Date best used by "" and it indicated that the product would only be good for 5 years. I'm not sure if I would have spent the money to buy this had I known I'd be short changed 2 years for storing."
5,Emergency Meal Kit,"The meals are great! Good tasting and essential... well balanced meals. I live in N.W. Florida, and we have had a number of hurricanes put the power out for days... 2 1/2 weeks when Ivan hit. This is much needed in times like those, and hurricane season begins June 1st this year. Be prepared!!!"
1,Danger Danger Danger,"This product should not be used for any type of work involving chemicals. These wooden test tube clamps snap easily into themselves leaving the test tube swirling through the air and consequently crashing on the table or floor. They are very poorly manufactured. I wonder whether people have already been seriously insured by a test tube filled with hot acid when this clamp catapulted it through the air. Definitely a possibility for a serious lawsuit here. If you have these contraptions, just pick up a test tube and shake it slightly. Of course, do not try this at home and only when the test tube is empty. - I found a use for these wooden clamps. They work well enough to hang up socks on a clothesline. But for this purpose you may be able to find much cheaper alternatives."
4,"""Crime & Mystery"" is the Mystery Reader's Reference Book.","""Crime & Mystery"" is a must own for mystery readers. Those new to the genre will get a ""leg up"" to the best of the best. Long-time readers will learn of out-of-print works unavailable in traditional book stores. If you were only to read the 100 titles listed in ""Crimes & Mysteries,"" you would have read the very best. The book is written in review style--this is not a book of short stories or excerpts. Please note: some of the titles reviewed are out-of-print. But, that's part of the mystery, isn't it..."
2,"Great list, but not very much help... and outdated...","I bought this book for the same reason you are thinking about buying it. You're tired of the [stuff] that's being churned out by the major publishers and want a quick list of 'classics' that will rock your world.That being said, if you just want the list, go to a book store, pick up this book, and memorize the list, then put it back. You're wasting your money if you think this book is going to give great insight into the mystery genre.The best way to find new authors/books to read is to do a little research. You like mysteries, right? What would one of these detectives do to solve the problem? Read up on the authors you really admire and you'll run across numerous references to their greatest influences.Also, I'm not a profressional critic, but some very notable mystery/crime novelist were conspicously left off the list. James Ellroy was one of the most notable. Oh well..."
5,My favorite!,"I love this moisturizer. I work in an industry where I have to constantly alcohol or disinfect my hands. I've tried a variety of hand creams/ moisturizers. L'annine has to be my favorite. Most moisturizers are too oily or smells great but has no moisturizing effects. And as soon as you wash your hands, you need to apply more moisturizer because you've just washed it all off. L'annine is creamy without being greasy. The smell is wonderful without being overpowering. I can wash my hands and my hands still feel soft."
5,L'annine Hand and Body Cream,"After reading many reviews about the use of this cream for eczema, I decided to purchase this product. I am so very glad I did. We have been using this for about a month and I am ""sold"" on the effectiveness. My granddaughter has a severe case of eczema and since we have been applying this her skin has improved greatly. I am not too keen on the avocado smell, but it is not offensive. The cream when applied goes into her skin very smooth and is not greasy at all! We have also used it as a diaper rash ointment!!! I highly recommend L'annine!!!L'annine Avocado Hand & Body Cream 2.2 oz cream"
4,a little expensive,This hand cream is very good but not worth the price. The tube is expensive and runs out fairly quickly.
4,Wow!,"This collection of short stories, connected by common threads of gypsys, quakes and troubled lives, was one of the most enjoyable books I've read yet. I practically read it cover to cover in a single sitting, it is that enthralling. If I have a complaint, it would be that it ended too soon, before I was ready to put it down. I recommend this book to everyone."
3,Good remote,Button layout is a little weak but works well to control Windows media center under Vista Premium
2,Ok for Media Center only,"This remote seems to work fine when used with Media Center, but it works ONLY with Media Center. It doesn't work on Windows Media Player so don't go buying this product thinking that it will. I used it with Media Center until I got tired of it not being able to play half my music and video files and so started using Windows XP without the Media Center. To my surprise, Microsoft's own Media Remote doesn't work with Microsoft's Media player."
4,It's almost wonderful!,"This Media Center Remote is a wonderful addition to any system. It has loads of features and works really well. It doesn't, however, deliver that all important knockout punch!"
5,Not a proper review but the two that claim to have bought it didn't comment,"Hey sorry for this type of ""review"" which it's not at all; but i'm wondering if ordering this from Worldwide you receive a brand new/un-opened box, is this item just as pictured? The A9O-00007 Microsoft model, also comes with the IR blaster for a satelite or cable so does this one as well?It's frustrating when sellers like Worldwide make there own product page instead of using the one already there for the A9O-00007, it makes me feel paranoid a bit that its a refurbished or missing parts & not a brand new boxed model. Otherwise why wouldn't they just list it on the regular page?I wouldn't bother writing a review or comment but they have a good price vs Ebay etc so ? any help would be good. Even if it only helps someone else."
3,Nice but expensive.,I bought the Media Center Edition Wireless Keyboard but it didn't have an IR receiver so I had to buy this remote control too. Both items work very nice but I spend more than $100 usd and all that I wanted was a wireless keyboard.
5,Microsoft HTPC MCE remote A9N-00009,"Ordered on of these for a Vista 32 MCE HTPC that I custom built. This remote works perfect. It lights up the important keys for dark theater room use. It is responsive unlike some of the ones thrown in with tuner cards (can you hear me DVICO?) I highly recommend one of these and the Microsoft MCE keyboard ZV7-00009, they work well together.My only other wish for this remote was for it to have a joystick or something for mouse movement. Some of the cheap aftermarket ones have that. The keyboard does, but since we are reviewing the remote...Bottom line, this is a fabulous remote for simple MCE interface use, the hot keys get you to the most used areas of Media Center. The number keys double as letter entry like your phone, to skip letters in your music library or whatever. BUY ONE!"
3,Works as advertised,To be honest I bought this just to use the receiver for the media center keyboard which works great on my home theater setup. I tried out the remote but use a Harmony remote instead of this one since it works on everything. I wonder why they discontinued this device.
4,Nice product,"Works great with Media Center and my Hauppauge 1213 WinTV-HVR-2250 Dual Hybrid PCI-E TV Tuner Board.I don't see Amazon selling it anymore though.UPDATE: Still working great, has proven to be very reliable"
5,Good Product!,This product is practical and does hook right up to your Windows XP Media Center with no issues!
2,poor customer support,"i receive the product incomplete, without the User Guide for Installation and Adjustment of the Tattoo Guns and when i tried to contact the seller i didn't receive any answer and then one of the machines started to fail not even 2 weeks after i got it, so if you are looking for a beginners kit i wouldn't recommend this for you specially if you are not getting any support from the seller and the equipment is going to fail in less that 2 weeks time-"
3,cheap box,"The kit comes well packaged and with lots of gear, but as soon as we tried it the fuse blew in the box.everything else seems to be ok but that is a serious disappointment."
2,More description would have been helpful.,I could not use this item. The online description of the heater didn't say anything about the fact that it would not turn on unless the water temp was below 40degrees. It just said it was thermostatically controlled. I incorrectly assumed that I would be able to adjust the temp (heat) I wanted. I'm sure under the right circumstances it would work great. It just didn't work for my purpose.
1,Very unreliable bad horrible pond heater do not buy better to heat pond with microwave oven,"I bought this heater for the 30 or so fish and the two turtles living in the pond in my back yard. It worked for one day and melted all the ice, so the next day i put my turtles in. Lo and behold, the next morning I awoke to a completely frozen pond with dead fish suspended in chilly horror within the several inches of ice that the heater was supposed to melt. Please do not buy this heater if you are using it for a backyard pond, or really anything, because it is cheap, assembled badly, unreliable, and hard to work with.Pros:noneCons:Does not workwill kill your petsVery unclear instructions"
2,too large,was too large for use in five gallon bucket. wouldn't even fit in it. can't do much about it. wasn't worth buying. but will find a use for it later.
3,No so much a review...,Does anyone else have trouble with the cage rusting? Mine also leaves a bluish oily film on the top of the water...
5,Certainly worth the purchase,"I saw Moke open for the Black Crowes and was totally blown away. When they opened up their set with the first track from the album, ""Down,"" I knew that these guys could rock. I bought the album that night and it seems that they have been a well kept secret ever since. Blazing guitars, strong bass lines, rocking beats, and roaring vocals. What more could you want!"
3,Talented,"These guys prove on this album that they have talent, but can they back it up. They seem kind of confused. I am not sure if they know where they want to go with their music. I thought I would like the variety on the album, but I am not too sure. My favorite song on this album is Mislaid the Key because I love the mix between the blues and the hip hop. It is definately worth a listen, check them out."
5,I saw Moke in New Orleans on the Tech Tour and they ROCK!,"When I saw Moke in New Orleans, I was extremely impressed by their music. Their diversity in music style was very entertaining. I'm sure I'll be seeing them again sometime soon. They are destined for success! They ROCK!"
5,Sublime meets Lenny Kravitz...Very Full Sound...and VERY fun,"I like Moke's style. Sounds like the late Brad Nowell paired with Lenny Kravitz band. Alternative for sure, but definitely not cheesy. Moke shows that there IS some good rock these days...it's just hidden."
2,Display isnt great!,"After seeing the price, features and the review - this looked like a great deal. I walked into circuit city to watch this TV. It has a very poor display. I decided to pass on this TV."
1,not exactly,"Hoses either fit, or they don't. The quality of the material is just fine on these hoses, sadly they did not comes as ""exact fit"". I had to cut, yes CUT, my brand new hose to fit. Does it work? Yes. Will it fail? Probably not. But it's an inconvenience. Will not purchase again."
4,Love it,"I love this product. It shows exactly where it will develop on your skin so you will not be surprised when it does form and you can rub in streak marks before its too late. It comes with a pair of gloves to prevent your hands from getting dark. It is the best self tanning lotion to me because it is so dark and natural looking. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because you can only really use it right before you go to bed and it will show on your sheets, however it will come out in the washer. The reason I do no use it during the day is because it does smell a little if you have it on during work or something and its that starchy smell. The shipping of this product was SUPER quick. Aside from only being able to wear it during the nighttime, I love it and continue to use it because of the results I get from it."
4,Great for vitiligo,I have only used two products this and another one from a direct website. I have vitiligo spreading on my hands and even though it doesn't cover it up completely it does darken the white skin pigment. I just don't care for the smell since I have to use this directly on my hands.
1,Didn't work at all.,"After I applied lotion, I was amazed how dark it is and was eager to see what the results would be but after showering off the lotion,I didn't see a difference at all!!!I also purchased Clarins Intense Bronze Self Tanning Tint and it is a pricey compared to this fake bake lotion but it worked SO well."
4,Leaves you tan for 4-5 days.,"Got this product last week, applied a generous amount before bed and slept on the couch to prevent staining. The color you get from the indicator alone is a shade or two darker then your actual color. I put this product on my face and it did not cause any irritation or breaking out. The tan gradually fades after the 3rd day and you go back to your original color after the 5th day. This is not a big problem, as it controls bad tanning sessions if you have streaks or missing spots, but it does take some time and effort."
3,Gave a little bit of color but not much,I applied fake bake lotion last night and was eager to see what the results would be in the morning. After showering off the lotion in the morning I didn't see much of a difference. I excepted a little bit darker of a color.I barely see any difference....maybe I have to do a few times before seeing a results.
2,WHAT HAPPENED?,"ok so when i first received this i applied it all over and the first day it was great! it gave me a nice color but the next day... it left my whole body all bumpy!!! and my smooth silky skin became beady bumpy, it was miserable and embarrassing to show my skin for that whole week unfortunately! if you are looking for an AMAZING self tanner, i found the best one ever! its called: Beach Sexy by Victoria Secret!:)"
1,fake bake,"Being white as Casper the ghost I thought I would try Fake Bake after reading many reviews of other products, I fallowed the instructions but this does not go on evenly as I spent some time trying to get it right. After an hour the smell got to me so in the shower I go and I saw the results.Blotchy is an understatement, I have racing stripes all over my legs, light and dark sopts.my feet look like I stepped in something, so when this wares off ""I hope"" I will man up and spend time in the sun. Best way to get a tan is 30-60 minutes a day in the sun ""no sunburn"" until you look good. Fake bake is not worth the $15."
1,Horrible!,"This product smells disgusting, it rubs off everywhere (clothes, sheets, etc), and takes forever to dry!!! It is overpriced and doesn't even get you tan. Sure, it'll go on dark but once you shower it all comes off! I will NOT use this ever again...even if you paid me!!!"
3,Totally Tan but Worried About Chemicals,"I first experienced Fake Bake at a salon in my area and loved the outcome, but when I look back it was not the original. I purchased this product and began to use it and instantly I knew I was going to love the color, but then the very strong and pontent scent kicked in. I did the self tanner before bed and once I got into bed the smell would not let me go to sleep. To be honest I'm a little worried, the smell actually burned my nose and throat after a little while. I want to use the rest of the fake bake because it does make you look tan, but at the same time I don't want to endanger my health. I have read some beauty products contain chemicals that are carcinogenic, and even though fake bake says they're all natutral I don't understand why I would have such a reation. So as of now I'm debating about returning this specific product :("
2,Disappointed...,"Pros: The color tone is good, Not orange.... that's it for the pros. Cons: Only gets so dark even when using daily. Smell is enough to make me wanna gag.Used for 5 days straight. Followed the directions exactly. Applied at night half hour before bed. Didn't get any darker than my 1st application. The smell is just awful. I don't know how they expect you to use this before bed cause the smell will keep you up."
1,Gave me a rash!!!,"I've NEVER had a bad reaction to any topical/lotion products before, but this gave me little red bumps everywhere!I tried it once, and a day later had a bumpy rash. I thought it could have been from something else so I tried it once more a week later, and had the same reaction.Also, the color it gave me was very minimal and stunk SO BAD. Worse than any other sunless tanner I have tried. My fiance literally didn't want to be near me because it stunk so much!I've tried countless other sunless tanners without this ever happening. Be careful!"
3,its ok,"not alot of color and when it wears off it looks like i have lots of dark spots on me, especially my legs. my personal choice is the loreal tanning towels. the towels are large, color is great and lasts for days."
3,Works for really white people,"I'm part hispanic, part white, so I have ""golden"" (aka yellow) undertones to my skin. So Fake Bake didn't give me much more color. It gave me a small tint, so I don't glow so much in the sun with my paleness (specifically my legs, which don't see a lot of sun in the ever-wet state of WA). But it didn't do much beside that. If I had pink or no undertones, I'm sure I'd have been very happy with the light tan this produced. But if you are olive or light-olive undertoned already, it probably won't do much for you."
3,Careful if you have allergies,"Although I am a heavy allergy-sufferer, I typically do not have problems with skin products. This one, however, broke me out in hives like crazy. Really bummed because I was happy with the color I got out of it!So you may consider testing a skin patch before putting it all over your body, if you have an inclination to allergies."
3,Natural Looking Color,"Product produced a natural looking color but it messy. It's best to apply at night so I would have to be careful not to get any on the sheets, my husband always complains when I use it. If I have a special occasion I want to have a tan for then I use it but it's not worth the mess for everyday color."
5,Love it very natural,This tamner comes wuth gloves and looks very natural i usually used st tropez but tried this because the price was lower and good reviews and its true i highly recommanf this my new fav self tanner!
5,I will NEVER use a Tanning bed again!!!! = ]]]]],I have been a religious tanner for years and years now...but never again will I use a tanning bed after being introduced to this product. My skin will now be more youthful and tan!! = ] I would recommend this product to EVERYONE that loves having a tan! There is no need for tanning beds that harm your skin and health when there is a product as GREAT as this one. I was kinda leary about trying a fake tanner for fear of turning orange or streaking..but Fake Bake is ABOVE all the others. STOP using TANNING BEDS and start using FAKE BAKE!! Make your skin happy and gorgeous for MANY more years to come! = ]]]]]]]]
3,"Great and natural tan after 2 applications, bad smell","Pros: Tan is very natural looking. Does not look orange, rather a nice brown color. As far as rubbing off it does a little bit after it dries but no more so than other self tanners. I would say its one of the better ones when it comes to this issue.Cons: It STINKS! Color didn't show up until 2 applications, ( put it on later shower that day, and the next day applied again). After the 2 nd application I would reapply like every three - four days.You must use the gloves. If it weren't for the smell I would rate five stars."
4,Works great but beware of the day you decide to no longer use it...,"The best color I've seen for a self-tanner. Easy to use. I accidentally left it on my feet for 10 hours so it was very discolored, but if you do it right, it looks nice. I used it twice to get the shade I needed for a wedding and stopped. After 3-4 days of not reapplying, my skin started cracking! I still give it 4 stars for producing nice results. I just didn't plan on continued use of this so I'm waiting for my skin to get back to its normal color before I can wear dresses/shorts again."
2,Will Work if You Have 2 months to Apply It,"I saw all the positive reviews and was looking for something as an alternative to damaging my skin. I agree with the review that said that right after you apply it, you look extremely dark. When you shower in the morning it all washes off. I applied it three days in a row, and barely noticed a difference. Unless you have 2 months to apply this nightly, I wouldn't recommend it."
1,EXPIRED!,"I was so excited to use this product, as I had heard awesome stuff about it. I was also excited because I'd gotten it so cheap! I had ordered indoor tanning lotions for tanning beds off Amazon before, and they were all fresh when shipped to me. However, I was EXTREMELY disappointed to find that when this lotion came to me, it was already EXPIRED!! It was GREEN. I slathered it on anyway (I was not about to waste the money I had spent), and the color guide turned my body a mossy green tint. The next morning, I washed off, and not a lick of the color (not even the green) had stayed on!! DO NOT RISK BUYING THIS ONLINE. This company makes this product with highly organic ingredients, so its shelf life is only 11 months. It's better to suck it up and spend the money for this tanner, because it's WORTH IT when it's FRESH!!"
1,really 'fake' bake,This product made me look like I had bruises! A $55 order and they wanted a $30 restocking fee. What a crock.
4,Fake bake great,"I really like Fake Bake. The only draw back is that it's really for the ""day of"" if you want to look dark. You must use gloves and rub it in very well, but it will not leave you orange at all. I have enjoyed it and will purchase it again. I also like it has no smell once it is on you."
4,Very Pleased,"I was happy with the results, there was no orange tint after. Definately would reccomend this product!"
5,great product,I have been using this brand for over ten years. It works better than any other self tanner I have ever tried.
1,Terrible self tanner.,"I ordered this self tanner, & did so, due to the rave reviews I had read........This had to be the worst self tanner I have EVER used!! It made my legs look dirty & the color was far from being a sun tanned look. Would NEVER purchase this again!"
5,best self tanner!,"I have tried so many different tanning lotions and sprays from Loreal, neutrogena, quick tan, St tropez, etc and I have now found my favorite and I will keep purchasing this fake bake. It's best to use it with gloves and the first time I put it on it looked like I had a couple sessions in the tanning bed. I'm completely sold but dont put it on your face! I love it this by far the best!"
2,Alot of work for an uneven tan,"I used to go to a tanning bed, but fears of skin cancer made me try a self tanner. After reading all the glowing reviews, I decided to try fake bake. After using for a few weeks and no matter how perfectly I followed the directions, I still ended with a splotchy tan and certain areas like my wrists and ankles just looked dirty. Was willing to put up with smell and light staining of clothes, but just wasn't too pleased with results."
4,happy with merchant and product,"I was very pleased that the merchandise I ordered arrived quickly, and it was well packaged. I would not hesitate to order from this site again. As far as the product, I just can't get the hang of using a self tanning product, but I think it works well enough to deepen my existing tan."
4,fake bake,"This is the best and most natural looking sunless tanner I have bought. I never have any streaks when I use it. Be very careful around your elbows and ankles, it tends to look darker there, but once you put it on a few times you learn the tricks! And I also mix a little bit of lotion with it (it does not affect the color) and this helps with the smell of sunless tanner. (This product does not have a strong scent anyway) Love this product and will only buy this from now on."
4,Fake Bake Self Tanning,I have been using Fake Bake for the last 8 years. So I guess you could say I really like the product. Ordering is easy and delivery is fast.The lotion is awesome and really helps the tan stay longer.
4,works well,Amazed at the color I achieved right away. The only con to this product is that the color got all over my flannel sheets even though I let the product dry on my skin hours before going to bed.
4,Will buy again :),"I used to be a tanning bed junky but then I smartened up :) and bought Fake Bake and I LOVE it! The only thing I'm not thrilled about is that the first day after putting it on, my face always seems a little oompa-loompaish... but by the 2nd day I love everything! It is not streaky at all and looks like a real tan. The first time I used it it went on SO DARK that I was afraid I over did it, but after showering it was just a pretty golden tan! I use it about once a week with gloves and now I'm all set for summer! BRING IT ON :)"
3,eh. its alright after day one.,"I got this and put in on the night before because i find it gives the tanner enough time to develop. when i woke up in the morning, i definitely was darker, however, it was all in my pores and such. since i had just showered the night before, i really didn't want to have to take another shower that morning, however, it's really necessary because otherwise you just look really dirty."
4,I like this,I would recommend this product over the spray. It only takes a little to go a long way. Thank you.
1,Not worth it,I tried this lotion and loved it when I put it on. It looked good and was easy to apply. When I took a shower the next morning it all washed off. Definitely not worth it.
2,product normally good this time it was BAD,"I don't know what happened but the product arrived and it was green so my legs were green and it was like water to apply. It went all over my bathroom tiles and grout. I don't know if this was some sort of knock off, but it was bad and Fake Bake is not cheap. Will not order from here again. I sent an email the minute I discovered the problem and there was no response. I live in Mexico so returning is a total pain, but now I know for the future."
4,tanned,this is a good product and i would buy it again i would recommend this to anyone who likea the look of tan but doesn't want the danger of the sun
1,I've had better...,"I've been experimenting with self-tanners for the last 11 years. I am naturally pale and have a hard time tanning, so I use self tanners to get my glow. I decided to try Fake Bake because supposedly celebrities use it, however I was very disappointed. After two messy applications, I have very little colour as opposed to other sunless tanners I have tried. The lotion smells very good compared to others, but the fake tint is very messy and gets on everything, not to mentioon it stays put in every crease of skin and if you put it on ur face it sticks to every blemish and it gets all over your clothes. There is no way you could put this stuff on any time besides bedtime and then go out, because it would be extremely noticable.Over the last 11 years and trying professional and drugstore self-tanners, I have found the Biotherm SUNTAN Sunless Tanning Milk for Legs and Body works the best. It gives the fastest, most natural colour as well as lots of moisture."
5,Fake Bake Junkie,"This is the most amazing self-tanning product on the market. It does not turn orange, but looks so natural, like you have spent time in a tanning bed, or on the beach. You have to follow the directions, and I have found it helpful to put lotion on before, especially on elbows, knees and ankles. I went to my dentist for a check-up, and as he was leaning over my face he said ""you must have been tanning."" Even that close, he could not tell the difference. I won't waste money on any other product."
2,Color washed right off,"After reading all the great reviews I was so excited to try this tanner. When I first started to apply the tanning lotion I was very pleased because it didn't have the normal self tanning scent that can be very overpowering. In addition, it gave me an instant bronze. I looked like I had just come back from a week long tropical vacation. After years of trying numerous fake tanners, I thought my search was over. When I woke up the next morning and washed the tanning lotion off, all of the color disappeared. Also, I did notice after a few days that it had irritated my skin, which is rare because I have never had any issues with other tanners. If the color had stayed as vivid as when I first applied, I probably would have still given it four stars."
3,It's Ok,"I purchased the product because of all the great reviews but it wasn't what I thought it would be. First of all, you definitely need to wear gloves unless you buy self-tan remover, but it looks great when you put it on, deep dark color from the color guide (sometimes a little too dark so it's a relief it washes off) but I have medium skin with yellow undertones and I got BARELY any color with the first application. I used it for 4 consecutive days and I turned yellow. The worst part was when it started to fade, it faded in PATCHES, not evenly! I thought this product would be my last self tanner but I'm still looking..."
1,Did not work for me,"I dont' understand why this product does not change my skin color at all. I put the product on my face and it looks like I am SUPER tan right away (although sticky) but then I wait 8-10 hours and I wash off the product and my face looks the exact same as it did before I put the product on. I have other product by Banana boat that REALLY turns me tan and I guess I should just stick with that one as it is cheaper and works for me. Not sure if this is a ""chemistry"" issue."
4,Works REALLY well,"I ordered this after quite a bit of research online and on Amazon. It arrived 2 days after I ordered it. I followed all the directions and was so pleased at the results!! The bottle looks like many of the rows of products you would see at a salon or spa/salon/tanning place. I have fair skin which rarely tans, my arms get a light brown from outdoor summer activities, but my stomach has not seen the light of day in years! The application was smooth, the color genuine, and the mess was minimal. Very pleased!"
4,"Looks Very Natural, but Time Consuming","Make sure you have a lot of time before you apply. Be sure to exfoliate, apply lotion to dry areas, and wear gloves. Only apply a small amount at a time, so you don't end up with streaks. If you take your time & do it right, you will love the natural tan results!"
1,"I don't know if I got a bad batch, but OMG does this stuff stink!!!!!!!","This is so smelly I almost gag putting it on. & it's so dark that if you don't wear gloves your hands will be stained for at least a day. It was just too dark for me. My feet looked horrible. If you have patients & can stand under a light & put it on perfect it would be good I guess, but I don't have the time."
1,Big Bummer,"This camera uses a type of electronic focusing where it looks at the image the CCD is collecting and uses contrast calculations to try to guess where to focus. According to the manual ""the camera focuses at the closest object"". Well, this is not acceptable. I think the engineers at Nikon were too ""focused"" on the cool swivel feature to worry about any type of ""traditional"" focusing system. Normally a camera shoots an IR beam at the object, and based on the bounce back, gets the distance, and then focuses based on that. With the swivel head, this camera essentially cannot use that type of focusing. The camera is going back, and I hope Nikon doesn't get hit with an FTC complaint for just how much of a lemon this thing is."
3,"Nice design, but mediocre performance","We liked this camera at first, when it seemed we were only taking daytime outdoor shots. Once you move indoors and start using the flash, the quality is pretty bad, the red eye problem is terrible, and the battery life is ridiculously short. One night of indoor photos, and you wake up the next day to find your battery is dying and it takes about a minute for the flash to recharge after each shot. So if you don't mind hauling your special Nikon battery charger on every trip, or if you plan to mainly use it outdoors, then it's an okay choice. Positive aspects are good design, easy to use, and good software package for uploading pics."
2,"Lots of information, but lacking reasoning about why...","The book is filled with solid information about the sail trim. However, I found the book dull to read (despite the fact that I am a keen sailor with a Master of Science in Engineering). The book takes the approach to explain each trim device in isolation. There is plenty of information about each trim device. I could not find any trim device not described in the book. If you want to know everything you can do with the vang, then this is the book for you.The book fails to explain what kind of overall sail trim you want in different situations. There is not a single example starting with a specific situation (like high waves, 2 knots of wind) and then explaining how -- and why -- to use all the trim devices to achieve maximum speed. There is very little information about the interaction of the trim devices."
3,trim for the racer,"This book bases its instructions on the expectation that you are using of a day sailor for racing. If you want to improve your sail trim on cruising boats, this is less helpful. Also, since I am not mathematically inclined much of it was too technical for my taste. Save the formulas and give me the empirical observations to go by."
1,"CHEESY, CHEESY, CHEESY!!","This sitcom is the ""cheesiest"" thing on television. Reba McEntire needs to quit while she's ahead. I bought the first season with high expectations and was disappointed. Therefore, I don't think I can expect better in the second season. I am one person who will not be buying this DVD collection. Once was enough for me!"
1,NOPE!!!,Reba McEntire has a program that robs the heart of its dignity. This show is one of the reasons that television is such a wasteland of immorality today. Will I be buying this?? Nope!!!
5,I love REba,"I love the SHow, Season 2 was a blast to watch because I had not seen certain episodes from that season! I was wondering when season 5 is goin gto be released because you Maazon will be the place a I buy it from! The packaging was awesome and it got here quick! Thank you!"
1,Reba Review,This a wonderful series! I love Reba and will get all the seasons eventually! Need to make more shows like this. Very good review on this product!!
5,"""REBA"" is on a roll!","This show gets better and better! If you havn't seen Season 1, it's also available on DVD! Do yourself a favor and buy both seasons! DEFINETLY WORTH IT!"
5,Mom loves this show....,"My mother fell in love with REBA years ago, and she found a volume at Cracker Barrell old Country Store. For $19.99 per season, so these were a fantastic deal. I bought a couple of seasons for her birthday and she was VERY pleased. They arrived VERY quickly also."
1,THOROUGHLY AGREE WITH THE ONE STAR REVIEWS,"This program falls into the classification of dumb and dumber. Miss McEntire comes off as a dumb hick who has no clue and who preaches in every scene, yet is a hippocrite herself. Don't waste your time buying into this useless tripe. Stick with the classics like ""I Love Lucy', ""Andy Griffith"" and ""Leave it to Beaver""!"
1,STOP TAPPING MCENTIRE AS ANOTHER LUCY!!,"There was and only will be one classic redhead associated with physical comedy and it is not Reba McEntire. Those who buy into this piece of fluff about dysfunctionalism are the same ones who glorify the immoral lifestyle that is plaguing our country today. We need more ""perfect family"" sitcoms out there that can help encourage us to live the way God meant us to and to strive for perfection. This program only encourages us to do the opposite. McEntire overacts so bad in every episode...but then she MUST always be NUMBER ONE. Lucille Ball is probably turning over in her grave when she hears people compare Reba to her. That in itself is a disgrace and an insult!! If you like the program fine but please...Reba is NOT nor ever will be another Lucille Ball."
4,"good, clean, hilarious show","reba is an addictive little show. you start watching just because it's on tv when nothing else is on, and before long, you look forward to watching it all of the time. it is a good, clean, hilarious show. it makes you laugh out loud. reba does an excellent job, as well as the other characters."
5,still love Reba,Second season is great like her first .You gotta have them all. She makes my days better .Don't miss Reba
5,"Clean family comedy, dvd",I have purchased all of the seasons of Reba and enjoy watching them over and over. It's clean family comedy. The characters are great
5,reba rocks,like the first review i am a new fan i never watched the show untill i got the dvd for christmass after that i am a true fan reba is a wonderfull perdson on and off camera i just wish that wb would reledse season 3 and 4 soon so i can watch season 5on tvps barbra jeen is the funiest carecter on reba
5,Love Reba,"I have bought all the Reba seasons and I love watching them, my husband even got into them. The story is great was a little disapointed how the show ended as you can see when you watch it that this show is about 5 people not 7. the other two are almost like fillers, but over all the show is great and its a modern version of Roseann with a differant story line. Great prouduct and I reccomend this to EVERYONE!"
5,good dvd,"part of the bottom of the case cracked off when i went tp put the DVD back after one use, other than that its good lol"
4,Whats not to love about Mike Rowe?,"Mike is a funny guy and this is a great DVD collection, nuff said! The case is good quality and the disc was in excellent shape, no complaints"
2,WHAT IN THE WORLD,I GUESS THAT A MOTHER CAN ONLY TELL HER SIDE THE WAY THAT SHE SEEN IT. I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS BOOK. IF YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT VOLETTA THEN THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT RIP B.I.G
2,it skips chapters,"I have now received 2 copies of this DVD and if you notice there are 3 episodes or more that do not play correctly. My personal favorite is the episode were Jerry is trying to become homecoming queen. It skips a whole chapter... THE WEESLE & THE CHICKEN... maybe the best comedy I have ever seen. Please check your copy and see if this happens, it is not the fault of Amazon it is a bad transfer to DVD that needs to be fixed. If you need to see this chapter it will go black screen for a short time after the locker scene, and skip to the next chapter. To see the chapter, go backard 1 chapter. I have had the same problem on all DVD players"
2,Thank god I love this show because....,"The DVD box set was not ""like NEW"" 2 Disks that were suppose to be properly place in the box set, came off! The cardboard to the box was bent and damaged., My DVD wouldn't read 2 of the 6 disks. NOT PLEASED WITH THE QUALITY. STOP NAMING THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT AS, ""LIKE NEW"" BECAUSE IT IS NOT!!!!!!! thanks thou!"
1,Not for the Hearing-Impaired,In this day and age not to add subtitles or captions for the Hearing Impaired is foolish at best and bordering on immoral at worst. I can't rate this product highly because of this.
5,Very satisfied customer.,"I am so happy that amazon had this, it was the only place I could find this product that would actually ship it to Australia. I watched the whole 3 seasons as soon as I could, I am addicted to this show! It's so funny and Stephen Colbert and Paul Dinello give it some sexy-factor. Anyone who has a weird sense of humour should watch this!"
4,DVDs in a small package,"No fancy cover and packaging, just DVDs in a case. The episodes are hiliarious. Stephen Colbert and Amy sedaris are fantastic."
5,Excellent Show,"It was great to have the entire show with out-takes and commentary. This is a must have for ""S.W.C."" fans."
4,THE standard text in its field,The book under review in my opinion is without doubt the standard published text in the contemporary horological literature on its subject.The material is comprehensive and clearly prsesented.
3,"Awesome picture, terrible sound","When we saw this TV is a side-by-side test in a showroom, we knew we had to get it. For the money, it has amazing picture clarity. DVDs going through the provided S-video connection are about as good as you're going to find on a non-digital TV.The BIG drawback is the sound. It's surprisingly bad. If you try to turn the sound up to a decent level (for say, an action film or music video), the sound gets annoyingly distorted. To fix this, we simply hooked the TV up to our decent home stereo system and everyone was happy. If you're planning on doing this, I'd highly recommend this set. If you're planning on relying solely on the onboard sound, I say: look elsewhere."
1,Bad JVC,"The JVC 27"" television [went] out on us right when the warranty expired. We called JVC and they were indifferent with the problem. Never buy a JVC product again!"
2,They are not comfortable at all,These boots were provided for me by my employer and I have to say they are very uncomfortable. If I had paid for them myself I would have taken them back. I would not buy.
4,Adirondeck Chair Set,"Although I liked what I see regarding the whole set, I would prefer this outdoor item in teak for durability, weatherwise. They have more charm in my opinion in the teak because of the way it weathers to grey and can be left outdoors indefintely. Cedar can't do that. I would be willing to invest more money to have a better product and durability. Thank you"
3,some are good; some are worthless,"This is hotel music. Many of the tracks are run-of-the-mill. However Pena's playful style is well-paced in Corazon Bandido and Aunque Me Cueste La Vida. I wouldn't get into her other stuff. It's hard to endure. For her part, Ana doesn't have a knock-you-down voice but it is ideal in the soaring, sorrowful Eso No Es De Hombres. What a big, heartfelt classic that is."
4,I don't write spoilers.,"Platoon, everyone knows by now. It's been years since I've seen it. They edited one part that I can see. When Junior gets bayoneted. They cut part of it. I guess it was too real for some pansy editor... As for Windtalkers. I see why single DVDs of it can be had for about 35 cents. It's mainly totally unbelievable battle scenes. I don't feel it does the real Code Talkers justice @all. You get it for what Platoon would cost alone, pretty much, though."
5,so cool,i like this thing so much i use it all the time snowboardin and in the car all the time.get this it records fast and really good sound get this thing
2,Broke too Quick,Hello allI Purchased this profuct the type 5 minidisc from sony and had a bad expereince with it. I had it for a bout a month when it started to not read discs. ONe day i was just walking with it and it syoped working i was lucky it was in the return period. Other than that i really like these things they are small and compact. The mini disc can hold up to 5 CDs. All and all it is okay because of my first problem.
4,Very Good Player,"I just bought this mini disc palyer based on the reviews and I am very happy with it! The sound is great!! The software was easy to install,and the first thing I did was download some of my files onto the disc..that was easy and didn't take long at all.So far I have 26 songs on the disc and still have room for more. There are so many features and options that I haven't learned them all yet. I think the car kit set up is to complicated..just reading the directions made me not want to even bother but I may try it.I felt that you should at least get the optical cable but thats me.I also thought the case was nice,its the kind you can wear on your arm,but I think its to bulky. I would have liked a waist type better.Over all this is a great player and I would recommend to anyone interested in mini disc players."
1,WARNING!!!!!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"First of all... This is not an MP3 Player, or recorder. What I mean is, it does not record an actuall MP3 on it. It records a format made by sony called ATRAC3. The software that came with the player is called OpenMG. It is the worst software I have ever used on my PC. Horrible software design, complicated to use the software, freezes up the computer when a file is a bit too large for it, NOTE: I am using a Pentium 4 2.0 GHz with 512MB of DDR RAM, and a 40 GB 7200RPM Hard-disk. This software uses more than 200MB of my memmory! I exchanged the product twice and now that it's BROKEN AGAIN, I cannot find it in any local Target."
1,Does NOT Record!,"The product name, ""Sony MZ-N510CK NetMD Walkman/Recorder with Car Kit"" (...notice how it says ""recorder""), is very misleading - I would go as far as to call it ""False Advertising"" - It DOES NOT have a mic input!I had a Sony MZ-R70 and I was looking to upgrade. I am a student & a musician, and my old MD player worked great for recording both lectures and gigs.The ""Sony MZ-N510CK NetMD Walkman/Recorder with Car Kit"", again DID NOT have a ""MIC INPUT"" and it was NOT able to record with the microphone plugged into the ""LINE IN"".Furthermore, the accompanying software did not allow me to transfer files to my PC that I had previously recorded with my Sony MZ-R70 - it kept throwing back error messages."
5,Wish I had this years ago!,"Great product. I wish I had discovered minidisc technology years ago. I purchase this for one reason (descrete, portable recording), but ended up using it mostly for another reason (music playback)It's not perfect. I wish it had the AM/FM turer, but I was not willing to pay the $70 extra for the model with the tuner. I would also have been nice to record off a mike, but it has a line input and you can run your mike(s) thru a mixer if you really need to record ""live"".Recordings made thru the line-input cannot be uploaded to your computer either.But what it does it does very, very well. A single 80 min disc can hold (at maximum compression) well over 5 hours of music! It only needs a single AA cell, and that lasts for over 50 hours on playback. Well worth the money."
1,Compatible with MP3???,"I was under the impression it PLAYED mp3s. After all, isn't that what the idea of compatibility should mean? Well don't be fooled. It CONVERTS mp3s to Attract format. Sounds nice except it converted my 30MB collection of speeches to 199MB and could not even fit it on one minidisc! Pathetic. If you want an mp3 player, this is NOT it. Don't make the same mistake I made!"
5,"Easy-reading, but very eye-opening and inspiring","Although the book was a nice, easy read, I was involved to the point where I couldn't put it down and wanted to know more about the Coast Guard. These men and women of the small lifeboat stations are true heroes. Thanks to Dennis Noble for telling their history and story. I was inspired so much by the desire to become a part of such an amazing tradition and responsibility that I visited my Coast Guard recruiter to join."
4,these guys are awesome in concert,"These guys came and played for us Army guys while we were doing a tour in Bosnia in 2000; I have to say they were really phenominal in concert. They covered lots of other artists music, from Greenday to Rush to Soundgarden if I remember correctly; as well as doing their own music. The crowd really got into it. The guys in Egodog were very entertaining and talented. I got this CD autographed by them there. Maybe it will be worth millions someday."
3,Stops recording on its own,"In manual analog line-in mode or digital coax-in mode randomly stops recording after 30 sec. of ""no signal"". The notion of ""no signal"" is the units's own, means that if the signal is below some threshold, it is interpreted as ""no signal"". Everything is fine if the music you are recording is ""ooompa, ooompa"". There is no way to record Arvo Part or Penderecki, for example.There is no way to deactivate the auto-stop functionality or to adjust the threshold. Since I am not interested in ""ooompa"" music, I decided to return the unit.""Manual recording"" should be manual: I decide wnen I start, I decide when I stop."
1,Horrible sound quality,"I bought the DLO transmitter to replace a Belkin TuneCast II that had wires come loose. The DLO looks good and I like the features it provides, input jack and charging capabilities. However, the FM transmitter is terrible. My Belkin worked great and I had no problems listening to it on the same stations that I try the DLO. The DLO cannot override the smallest amount of sound on a station. I'm constantly having to change channels and the static on all of them is unbearable. I'm back in the market for an FM transmitter. This thing is basically a charger only, because trying to use it has a FM transmitter is a waste of time and huge source of frustration. Maybe I got a bad one, but based on the product I received I could never recommend this product anyone."
2,Detroit suburbs,"The sound quality was very good but the FM interference was pretty bad. There was a constant static sound that was very noticeable at mid volume but was horrible at high volumes. I tried every blank station on the dial but no luck correcting the problem. I live in the Detroit suburbs where there is a station on almost every number on the dial. I believe this was the problem. Also, I use this device on the stock stereo in a Pontiac G6. I don't know if that was a source of the problem or not. I would not recommend this product because of the constant static."
2,Mostly a PITA,"This product was quite a disappointment. Sound quality is poor,there's a constant background hum that rises with the volume, and you need to unplug the player from the device, as well as unplugging the device itself to shut it off. Also,the controls on the player(on-off and volume)don't function when it's plugged in via USB. You need to use the headphone plug instead if you want to turn it off without unplugging everything.All that,and I haven't even tried it with the car moving!I tested it parked in the garage, and was so annoyed with all the problems I haven't used it since.It's not worth the hassle and expense to send it back, so I guess it can lay in the console unless I get desperate for some different tunes.Maybe it will charge my cellphone,though that's hardly worth fifty bucks."
1,all static noisie,"DLO 005-2120 TransDock micro for the E2xx, C2xxdidn:t work at all to much static everywhere i went."
2,Poor quality for the money,"I bought this to replace an Itrip FM transmitter for my Sansa E280 that died after about a year of use. It is of poor quality versus the itrip. It is difficult to find a station that it can overpower and there is always a high level of static even when it is tuned to a frequency with no evidence of local radio station. In addition to the static, it tends to make the bass tones sound like a symbol is going off in the background at certain times and on certain songs (even the highest quality mp3 or wma). It is nice that it includes an auxiliary jack that you can plug other brands into, but the sound quality is too big of a negative. I have ordered another itrip in hopes that it will last longer than a year this time."
4,Good product,"I really like this product and would recommend it to anyone. I do get a little static on some channels, but I can usually find a station that is very clear."
2,Transdock Micro for Sansa E&c,"This Item is basically worthless when used to transmit music from Sansa e260 to a car radio, it is full of static no matter what FM frequency I tune to and I have tried them all. Also tried 3 different cars and received the same results in each, even tried moving the audio and USB cables around to lessen this noise but it did very little good. If you are able to get rid of most of the static when parked as soon as you start driving it is there again. The only good is that it works fine as a car charger for the Sansa.Not worth purchasing, buy a Tape Player adapter if you vehicle is equipped with a cassette player or have an audio input jack installed on your car sound system."
5,excellent product,"I tried less expensive FM transmitters and had spotty, static filled performance from each. I then decided to spend a little bit more on this one, and it was well worth it. I get clear reception even on major stations in my area. Highly recommend"
4,Good poster,Very cool poster the artwork is great but the colors are a bit dull makeing it not as vibrant as i would've hoped but still very worth buying
3,Not as UV reactive as I would have liked,It does light up a bit next to a black light but not nearly as much as I would have hoped. You basically have to have the light right on top of the poster.The artwork itself is awesome.
4,intricate,"The poster arrived after two days of waiting which was faster than the 3-5 day shipping i had selected with my order. the poster itself arrived in prestine condition but it came in a box 3 times its size lol. the picture itself is beautifully printed with all the charecters you would expect to see from alice in wonderland. the whole picture is almost a mosaic of the chesire cat which is in turn sitting apon the mushroom that forms its lips. overall it was a great deal the one and only problem i had with my purcuse was the fact that the poster was slitly creased apon arrival which initally ticked me off but once i put it on the wall thay became unnoticable.peace, love, and a good buzz"
4,Fascinating,"The colors are beautiful and subtle. I had it professionally framed and it looks wonderful in my office. Though, the colors are nice it lacks some detail and if you just walk by it catches the eye but you have to stop and really look to see everything."
3,Does it work?,"I'm cycling a new tank and I'm not seeing ammonia levels going down since I starting using these. It's only been a few days but I would expect to see a small drop in the level.It's easy to use, I just can't tell if it's working.Update: 4 days after writing the review my ""Live NH3"" meter, and API drop test are showing ammonia levels very close to zero, well below the 0.5 - 1 ppm they were so I guess this does work. I'm glad I got this."
4,Met expectations,I've been using these for a while. They do a pretty good job. The price was less than at the store.
5,Biz Op book - Dear (Bon Bon)..,"Pretty uproarious stuff. I DID lend this book to a friend and never saw it again. I just hope they weren't arrested!!Informative about scams like ""stuffing envelopes"" and the like. Ingenious schemes having to do with donating; evil evil book!Heaven help you if you're renting a PO Box with your own name though!! A lot of this stuff is borderline illegal and verges on mail fraud!Still a fun read though. VERY entertaining. RIP Loompanics"
2,The season of MI5 is dull and boring,"Season 1 and 2 were amazing. This season was so dull I had to skip episodes (most particularly episode 7). I do not like Adam Carter nor his idiot wife. Tom, Zoe and Danny are a one of a kind team. I will definitely skip seasons 4-6 as it obviously looks very annoying. I'll be back with seasons 7 and 8 with Richard Armitage. This show is definitely rated on the actors they have chosen. Adam Carter and this team are very bad."
2,Not one of their best,"This series in my opinion does not measure up to some of the others. A lot of silly, superficial melodrama took up most of the episodes, especially with Zoe's character, and often the personalities of the characters contradict one episode to the next. As if different writers wrote the stories (which is the case) and could not agree on a cohesive picture for each character. More soap opera than thriller. Too bad."
3,Mistake for MI-5 producers?,"Producers and writers are always needing to examine their programs with the intention of keeping them fresh. They sometimes take drastic measures, but it is usually a mistake to replace popular and competent leading men and ladies, because as most of us know, the characters (and the actors who portray them) are who viewers come to care about, not the series itself.So MI-5 has strolled off the end of the pier: in one season we have lost Tom, Zoe, and Danny, and their replacements, though possibly competent, are definitely NOT Tom, Zoe, or Danny. I may not return either."
4,A bit tired by the third season,I don't recommend watching MI 5 one after another in series. They get repetitive. Each episode has the same structure as the last.
5,great show,"This is one of the best shows i have seen in years series 3 time to buy the next, they have already killed most of the cast off. dont see that on american shows."
2,Why?,"After eagerly awaiting the return of MI-5, I was so disappointed to see the 'recycling' of three members of this amazing cast. The replacement husband/wife duo quite frankly annoyed me. The husband was super-human and the wife irritating and over-confidant. I had to fast forward most of the hostage episode and episode with the wife snorting coke for the scenes with my favorite characters. This season quite frankly blew. I probably won't be buying season 4, I HATE the new characters. Disappointing on all levels.2 stars."
3,Bring TOM back!,To be a CUTE actor is not enough! Matthew MacFadyen is HOT! Bring Matthew back! Please!I have already sold the third series of Spooks and are not buying the rest.The first two series will always be in my DVD collection.
2,Mission Impossible!,"This set of DVDs would have been quite entertaining to watch, but... the discs I received were not the correct format (Region 1) for use in my DVD player. As a result, it was necessary to return them. Don't know if this was an isolated problem with this product, or if all may have the same issue. In any case, prospective buyers should be aware that they might experience a similar problem if they purchase this item."
4,Very good but not as good as seasons 1 and 2,"My husband and I are both hooked on 'Spooks'. We own all three seasons and are looking forward to the 4th. Have to say though, Tom, Zoe and Danny are more believable than the new characters in season 3. Also, for us, the development of some of the personal relationships in season 3 smack of some soap opera stuff. We also believe a few scenes were too drawn out, i.e., the torture scene and Danny's assassination dilemna. That being said, we still highly recommend it. Would rate it a 4 1/2 if we could."
5,MI-5 - THE BEST EVER,"I have now been through all 7 seasons of MI-5(Spooks) that are available in the US. I think it's the best spy-action-suspense series of all time. Unlike 24, it is consistently plausible. I say tomyself after every episode, ""yes, this could happen."" There are always surprises and they rarely stretch credulity. And the casting, with all the changes, is remarkable. It seems that what startout as replacements always take you in quickly. The best of the best is Season 7 Episode 7. It rises to the highest level of John LeCarre. Don't miss it! I will, however, always miss Rupert Penry-Jones, who blows up at the beginning f Season 7. He was the most debonair of all the characters. I'm sure he'll go on to leading man fame in the movies."
3,Too small & cushy,I was sooo excited when I saw this. I have a touchscreen phone and am used to a stylus. But this is too small & cushy. It doesn't connect with the screen very well. I'm still on the lookout. And if it could be somewhere between this size and the regular size one it would great.
5,My wife loves it.,It makes using her iPod a lot easier and she likes the small form factor. It works well and the way that it hooks into the iPod is a great way to keep it safe when not using it.
5,Excellent tool - but it little too small,"I purchased both styluses..This small jewel and its big brother and they are both excellent tools. I don't have a really big hand (glove size L), but it takes some getting used to for the small one. They worked as designed. I still give it 5 stars because it works so well."
3,Mediocre at best.,"DVD's look sharp using component video input, but satellite tv picture suffers (using S-Video input). Solid colors appear with blocky artifacts. Ghosting occurs with some text when on a contrasting background.But, for the price, the TV offers a good set of inputs and decent sound. Also, the other features like PIP, on/off timers, audio out, etc make this a good buy for the money. But if you're a stickler for a good picture, spend more and get a Sony."
1,Poor quality product - BEWARE,"I bought two of these and the cedar storage bench - both were mistakes. When I tried to assemble these, two things happened. First, the preassembled sides, apparently with only under-used glue and no screws - fell apart. I had to add glue and provide my own screws to reassemble. In addition, in 1 or 2 of each leg that I tried to fasten the base with the wheels, as I tapped the wheel base into the wood so it stayed in place when you lifted the rolling trellance - the leg(s) split. What poor engineering and quality. Stay away from this company's products."
1,Cheap cheap cheap.,"Unfortunately I am talking about the quality, not the price. I ordered four of these and three showed up with broken parts. While the manufacturer was very responsive in sending out replacements, it hardly bodes well for longevity - especially outside where I was hoping to use them. The staple construction is flimsy at best, and the cedar they are using might as well be balsa wood. If your lucky enough to get one with the pieces intact, I wouldn't bet on it lasting more than a season outdoors."
5,Blessed Praise!,"This CD brings me to praise my Lord each time I listen to it. The music is so fresh and energetic. Lyrics are encouraging, especially the title cut ""More Than Enough."" Even standards like ""Celebrate Jesus"" are creatively new and interesting. Psalm 102:18 is listed as an inspiration for this CD...it encourages us to teach our children to enjoy praising the Lord!"
5,Excellent,"I think the album is inspiring and uplifting. It is just the type of music that you listen to when you are going through your trials and tribulations.I just want to know how can I get a video on this artist, (GARY OLIVER/""MORE THAN ENOUGH)."
2,Dissapointed with this CD,"I bought this CD based on the wonderful reviews at this site. However, I was dissappointed with the CD as a whole. I enjoyed two songs of the entire CD. This one will not stay in my collection. My best wishes to Gary in his ministry but it seemed the whole thing was a forced fit with exception of ""More Than Enough"" and that song is great. One song is hardly worth the price of a CD."
4,Very good poetry,This book is a compilation of different poems from various poets (most of which I think are amateurs). Not all are good but there are definitely some shining stars and diamonds in the rough to be found here. The presentation of the poems isn't that great but the content of the book makes the whole thing worth it if you're looking for some highly enjoyable modern poetry.
1,Zzzzzzzzzzz.........,"Books dealing with the Holocaust, I believe, can be shockingly upfront, and wrenching...Postcards from No Man's Land was a terrible leafing...rather like something you'd like to throw at the furnace, really. Half the book was obsessed with sex, and ""growing up."" I admit...I did not finish the book. I was appalled at Chambers lack of reality and genuity.Sometimes, when I read stuff like this, I think, if this awful stuff can get published, than so can I. They REPETITIVELY refer to the Anne Frank diary...a nice reference, but superbly annoying when it's talked about over and over again. Jacob simply loves to induldge in the kisses of Peter and Anne, and why Peter held back. Really.I am shocked and galled that this book received the Printz award!! There must have been an extremely low field that year. *sigh* If you're looking for a terrific(and something that's actually BELIEVABLE), I insist on checking out: The Pianist, Diary of Anne Frank, Sky, and etc."
2,Good season but bad quality of the DVD,"I am a fan of Criminal Minds and I own all the seasons.However, I am surprise to find that the quality of this Season DVD is really bad...almost like a VHR or VCD quality... =("
3,Rather had the DVD,"Clear and without fault... however, I am not able to copy and put on to disk would have rather had this episode available for DVD library."
5,Love Me Some Criminal Minds!,"I love the original characters! Especially Agent Rossi (Gideon Who?), Spencer Reid, and Penelope G. The unique and exciting story lines make this TV Drama one I enjoy watching more than once. So far, each season just keeps getting better and better!The only thing I would suggest is a warning label...Danger! This show is addicting!"
4,"Great Show, not so great product","I gave this a 4 out of 5 because I LOVE the show! However when I received the box in the mail, it was broken. And although the package was wrapped, there were finger prints on the backs of the dvd's and I had to clean them before they would read on the dvd player. I hesitate to buy dvds/cds from amazon again because of the quality of the dvds when arrived."
4,Kind of Creepy,It is kind of a creepy episode with the music and all. One mom never gave up on her son. Even though no one believed her.
5,Criminal Minds: Fifth Season,"I am such a Criminal Minds fan! I loved this season,as well as all the others. It was wonderful. Once you start watching this show,you will not be able to get enough. I am buying all the seasons,because I want to watch them all in order. Over and over."
4,DVD Quality?,"Series was fine. Unfortunately the DVD itself seemed off. The sound levels did not consistently match to the DVD menu volume, so I could have the volume maxed out during an episode just to hear, but soon as it was over and it went to the DVD menu, my ears were attacked.It's not the seller's fault though as it is the manufacturing. It still shows the episodes well enough so I don't mind keeping it. Item was shipped and received well within the required shipping time-frame and packaged securely."
5,Criminal Minds: Fifth Season,I enjoy Criminal Minds to the point that since I have to wait so long till the next season is out on DVD. I take my time watching the new season . As well as going back to the first and watching them all. Never disappointed
5,Criminal Minds,"I have now finished my 5th of this excellent series. I look forward eagerly to No. 6 - hope it won't be too long. This is an excellently produced and acted series - each actor brings his or her character to life, seemingly with incredible ease, and whilst the stories can be violent and gruesome ""The Team"" always get their man - or woman. Incidently, Shemar Moore is the most dishy actor since the young Sidney Poitier, and Matthew Grey Gubler is delightful.Long may it continue and many congratulations to all of the cast, crew and writers."
5,love it,Love it. This show is amazing and this is the only way I get to watch it since I don't have cable.
1,Disk one and two doesn't work,"I love Criminal Minds, and I love using Amazon, but I was surprised and upset that disc one and disc two does not work. I have seasons 1-5 so far and this is the only one that has any issues. I have not contacted Amazon to resolve this issue, but the cost to return the item, is almost not worth it. I can't say that this is Amazons fault- but the season shipped from their warehouse. The other discs work fine-"
4,Drama,"Once again I am purchasing a favorite series. I liked the fifth season. It took a season for me to get used to the change in cast. Now that I have accepted changes, I am able to relax and watch the show for the drama it is."
4,Great Show,"Criminal Minds is one of my favorite shows! It has everything in it that you need. The actors and actresses are great, there is humor and there are serious and touching moments in every episode.However.When I got this set, the box was a little ripped and the DVD's were not even in their spots. Disk 5 was in disk 4 and they were ALL like that is even at all. A couple disks were just free, meaning if I picked up the case I could hear the disks shaking. The plastic dvd holders don't snap/close together well and the plastic over the paper cover is crinkled. Very disappointed on how the product was delivered."
4,Perhaps the last...,People who are hard core devotees of this series may have to agree that this might just be the last good season of Criminal Minds. So far season six episodes are so flat that it's easy to assume that writers have been told to pen the swan song of this show. Couple that with CBS giving two members of the ensemble the axe and it's not hard to believe that the series really ended with season five.
3,Unhappy,"Ordered the 5th Season three times. First time the first disc would not play, while the remainder played fine. Returned and replaced set. In the replacement set the first disc would not play while the remainder discs played perfectly. They would not replace. They refunded. Ordered third set again. First disc would not play. Gave up and kept the item."
4,Criminal minds season 5,"What can i say, I love them all! and this season is just as good, the episode where Hotch loses his wife is a real tear jerker!! i loved it!"
5,Criminal Minds Season 5,I liked the whole season. Some were very sad and I cried. In a whole I enjoyed the entire season and would give it the highest rating.
1,Defective article,Price was right; shipment was speedy; but back light would not work so unit worthless; returned for credit which has been received.
4,Good for the Money,"Considering the cost of Sudoku puzzle books, the price is a good deal. It has a few places where you really have to push and push to get the number in the square. The instructions could be better. Scoring is a bit strange, and your stuck with a puzzle once you start it. But, over all, it is a handy toy. The backlight is good, and the size and shape are nice on the hands. Gives three levels of difficulity, hints, answers, and pause button. Have enjoyed the entertainment."
3,"Value for money, but bad backlight","I bought this for my dad, thought it would be a good gift, even though the ease of use and other things are good about the toy, the backlight is bad.The overall finishing of the product is a bit disappointing as it looks kind of a cheap toy, but the functionality wise its good, may be thats what you get for the price I paid for this"
4,Pretty Good,"The Good - Quite good for the price it comes for. Ease of use comes with practice. Not too huge not too small, perfect size.The Bad - You have to use the back-light to view the numbers clearly unless you plan to hold it constantly at a certain angle. Contrast could have been better. One star less for that :-)"
4,Soduko,It is Ok but it is a little difficult to figure outhow to play it with out clear instructions. Especiallyif you are not a soduko fan to begin with..But once Ifigured it out I enjoyed playing it a couple of times.Someone who is a big game player would probably enjoy itmore that I do. But it is good to have in the house toentertain 'gamers' when they visit.
2,Small and hard to read,"I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves Sudoku. However, he did not like this game because he said it was too difficult to use the screen and it was in a very small font. Pass on this one."
3,"Hard to see, even with backlight.","I ordered this because of the backlighting, but the contrast is not adjustable, which means it's very difficult to see unless you have it at the exactly right angle. Also, the font or text displayed is just not easy to work with. I had hoped to give this to my Dad who is a big Sudoku junkie, but considering I have perfect vision and can't work with this, I doubt he'll enjoy it with his less than great vision.I had read reviews on every electronic version Amazon has and thought this one offered the best bang for the buck, but have now concluded that there just isn't a good version out there yet. Maybe on a Game Boy or something."
2,Not very sophisticated compared to some.,"I purchased it as a present & the recipient was not comfortable using it. no ability to hold potential numbers, prior to making a choice."
3,It's not bad. But could be better.,"This is our second electronic Sudoku game. And our first was not a touch screen, so this one is easier to navigate around the board than using a directional pad.BUT, we have only used it a couple weeks and I already see tiny scratches all over the screen, especially along the bottom where you select your 1-9 number to place on the board. It is not affecting the play right now. And we have not had it long enough to know how long it will last before it gets too scratched up to use.Also we like to have a little competition in our household, so we look at the high scores. Well this one does not add initials or anything to the high scores when you win. And in addition, the high scores flash very quickly (for a few seconds) when the game ends, and then goes away. And I have not found a way to display the high scores again without playing another game. So it is about impossible for me to show off my low completion times and superior intellect!"
2,Very hard to read,"I ordered this for my wife because of the reasonable price and decent reviews but was disappointed when it arrived and saw that the backlight did not work. Without a backlight this unit is very, very difficult to read, even when holding the unit directly in front of my face. Sent it back for a refund."
4,2 hot to let go,"Another excellent reissue by Hip-O-Select (Universal Music) of the 1978 Peaches and Herb release 2 hot! The full album is being released here on CD for the first time. Digitally remastered from the original master tapes, with one drop-out on track 1 (at 3:03). Limited edition to 5000 copies only. Get it before you are too late. Here's the track listing:1. We've Got Love2. Shake Your Groove Thing3. Reunited4. All Your Love (Give It Here)5. Love It Up Tonight6. Four's A Traffic Jam7. The Star Of My Life8. Easy As Pie"
3,Sorry Michael,"Sorry Michael. Only Forward was a brilliant achievement, but this seemed to be too many rehashed ideas and not the mind blowing trip that was it's predecessor. Still a great book, a little too dark in one shadowy corner for my liking, but bettering your debut was always going to be a tall order."
5,Fantastic Journy,"I was amazed by Spares, i first read The Straw Men by Michael Marshall and loved it, so i picked up Spares and tore through it in a few days. Fantastic book, amazingly original ideas and distinct fun-to-read page turning writing style. It's true that most of Michael Marshall Smith's protagonists are somewhat similar, but every book is unique and every story is original and mind blowing. After enjoying Spares so much, ranking it very high up in my all time favorites list, i now own every book written by Michael Marshall Smith or Michael Marshall, i have been reading a book a week for years now, and Marshall provided me with some of my best reads."
2,"""Loser overcomes all odds"" fantasy.","This is billed as a ""noir"" science fiction thriller, but it's closer to a '40s Mike Hammer fantasy. The hero, a drug addict who can't do anything correctly, including keep his family alive, somehow manages to overcome more obstacles than Hercules and Odysseus combined. It pushes your suspension of disbelief well past the breaking point. There was some novelty, but it wasn't worth the price. The part about the five-mile square flying shopping mall seemed particularly unreasonable."
4,"Weird, remarkable book","This book is fast-paced, occasionally brutal, and quite often just plain strange. I enjoyed it thoroughly.It started off as a hard-boiled, hard-sci-fi action novel with some odd characters and unusual scenery. It turned into a remarkably imaginative romp through strange places and stranger plot twists. The exploration of the protagonist's psyche and background was much deeper than similar books in this genre -- the section after he's Gone Away stands out in particular.The only thing that bugged me was the incessant ""___ was like ___"". Too many things were described in terms of other things; the language pattern started to wear on me.If you don't like strong language and the occasional blood & guts, you don't want to read this. If you don't mind, this is a great read."
4,Future Pulp Rip Snorter,THat's is pretty much what I thought of 'Spares'. One of those books that leave you slightly out of breath.
1,not worth reading - It's a bait and switch,"i've read 3 of michael marshall smith's books (spares, one of us, only forward) and enjoyed 2 of them, ""one of us"" and ""only forward"".I was, unfortunately, very disappointed in ""spares"" and thought it was a waste of time to read. The book is a bait-and-switch, because the concept of ""spares"" (using body parts of a clone to replace those in the original person when needed) which is very interesting, is not a central part of the story. Rather, the story is more of a prolonged chase of the main character which is both boring and predictable.Don't bother with this book."
3,what a babe,"If you want to see some soft core Japanese adult entertainment this is pretty good. Wih only one girl in the video it's kind of repetative, but what a body on this lovely model."
3,If you don't plan on showing this book ain't for you,Way too much info on showing. If you are looking to learn about the breed. Pick another bood
4,Roman helmet,This product arrived in good condition and in good time. If padding inside is desired ( and it pobably will be for most buyers ) you will have to provide that yourself. It's a very impressive piece of Roman armor and I would recommend it to other buyers
4,Essential really,"I've just been to Helsinki for a few days, and although I didn't get the chance to test this book's usefulness in other parts of the country, it certainly proved worth having just for Helsinki. It tells you all the basic stuff, and some of the interesting stuff. I was able to get from the airport by bus and walk to my hotel from the bus station simply by glancing at the book on the flight to Helsinki. Everything is very clear and nicely laid out, and it's a handy size too. I hope I'll return to Finland; this is the first thing I'll pack."
3,Lots of maps and pretty facts...,"But if you happen to be in Finland, the only thing you'll need to sample is the local alcoholic beverages."
1,This Seat Doesn't Fit our Standard Toilet,"The toilet seat is very nice looking, but the hardware doesn't fit our standard toilet. I notice it was manufactured in China. Perhaps they use different hardware there. We felt really bad that we were not able to use it.We have purchased standard toilet seats in the past with no problem."
1,need more info,I bought this and had to send back it did not state that is was for small bowl I had a oblong bowl. But they did refund my money very fast!
5,Loved it!,"This is a really great book that I just finished reading. I am a school librarian and I like to read new fiction to be able to make thoughtful recommendations to our kids (and because I love to read). I hadn't ready anything by Henshon before, but she really has a great style that creates a wonderful narrative which entertains and at times made me laugh out loud. The book is the story of a richly created character, Mildred, who won't clean her room. Mildred goes on to have some fun adventures as she becomes an entrepreneur (don't want to give too much away, however!). Henshon writes in the first person, and Mildred is an easy character for kids to relate to - confident but shy, smart but measured, and adult-like but still very much a great kid. I would highly recommend this book as a fun and incredibly enjoyable read for girls or boys, 4th, 5th, or 6th grade."
2,Extremely Difficult,"This game is like work!! There are soo many techniques to learn that it killed it for me. I just want to play a game and have fun....not spend hours reading a lengthy manual and practicing moves. I was hoping for something just a little more complex then the Wii Sports baseball. But I think I will stick to that from now on. If you have the time and the patience and the skills, though, I bet it would be a pretty neat game."
4,Takes a while to get - but then fun,"This isn't one of the games that you pick up and just go with, you do need to spend some time reading the instructions and practicing. I haven't tried to play the computer yet, because most the time we easily have 2 or more playing. For two people, I think this game is a blast once you get the hang of it. The graphics, sounds and commentators are all very good. The way that you control your players seems to be very much in your remote and numchuck and you seem to really have control both offensively and defensively. We were really excited when we found this game because we are huge baseball fans, and so far it seems to be right up there with Tiger Woods as our favorite game we have played so far."
1,A delay in the swing on a baseball game?,"For those who have not played the game, when you swing the Wii remote the batter does not swing his bat....there is a delay. How can they not make sure to get the swing right on a baseball game? Doesn't that defeat the whole purpose of the Wii remote if the game will not mimic the movements of the controller? You mine as well be pushing a button on the 360 or the PS3.Even with all of Wii Sports Baseball's flaws and limitations it still got the basics right."
2,Not fun to play,"This is one of the most irritating video baseball games I have ever seen. The controls are so complicated to learn and use that the game is just not fun to play. The only reason I can think of that so many people gave this game good reviews is that they played the game on other platforms where the controls were much simpler. The writers of the Wii version of this game got so carried away with the new stuff they can do that they forgot to actually play the game to see if it was fun. Well, I can tell them now to not waste their time. This game is not fun. If this were the only Wii game there was, the Wii wouldn't have sold 5 copies. Fortunately, it's not."
2,Fun but not for baseball purists/realists,"It's fun but not realistic, and arcade-y, not stat driven. The ""Power Blasts"" and 30-ft. superman leaping catches at the wall are quickly tiresome.""Rookie Mode"" is decent but there is no Dynasty or team management as has become standard in other baseball games."
1,DO NOT GET THIS GAME!,"If you are a hardcore baseball fan, little kid, or anybody else, DO NOT GET THIS GAME! I like Wii Sports Baseball better than this. 1st of all, the hitting. Everytime you hit the ball, it goes to center field and you get a single. You can't hit a stinkin' homerun unless you have enough points. The graphics are terrible. Everybody looks the exact same. With the Wii remote, you have to flick the ball to the base you want it to go to. How can you get it to go to 2nd, and not home? YOU CAN'T!!!!! If you purchase this game, you will be dissapointed. Get MLB Power Pros instead. It's easier and much cooler than The Bigs or should I say The Worst Baseball Game EVER!"
3,Not a bad game,"This game isn't bad...when I bought it I didn't know what I was expecting i guess but I was a little disappointed to see that the game has lots of unrealistic features. If you want you can kind of say this is the ""NFL Blitz"" of baseball...the outfielders can jump around 20-30 feet in the air and the baserunning is much faster than anything I know. But for the actual game itself, I do enjoy it and it is fun experiance. I do wish it would have a ""season"" option. It has a ""rookie challenge"" which is the only thing it has close to a schedule. Overall the game good and I love almost all baseball games so I am not one to be too picky or disgruntled."
2,Is it really all that BIG?,"If you are looking for a great baseball franchise game or just a good baseball game, you shouldn't buy this game. As advertised on the back of the game case, it is a arcade game version of baseball. Just a warning, be prepared for cheap homeruns and pitches."
4,Fun!,"This is a very good game. The controls are very good, graphics good for a Wii and a 2K game. (I have 2K baseball for my DS, it sucks). You can do a regular game, Homerun Derby, or Rookie Challenge. That's where you are a rookie and join a team, do things, and become a star. To my dismay and disappointment, there is no Dynasty/Franchise mode. That is the only thing I don't like about this game."
3,Decent for the money,"I was able to get these shoes for a great sale price (under $17) and they are great for running around doing daily errands, etc. But they are so soft (bordering on flimsy) that they provide little or no support and now a few months later, they look ""wrinkled"" and have creases in the top of the shoe from wear. They wipe clean, and even though they are creased up, the material has no scuffs, no tears and the color has remained unchanged. I would definitely buy again."
3,nice but not great,This shoe fit true to size for me and looks fine. Just be aware that it is very flat in the sole - no cushioning or arch support. I will have to get an insert to wear with it.
2,not happy,"Not happy at all with these shoes, they are way too narrow. I bought two other brands and they fit perfectly. I would have to think twice before ordering this brand again. Steve's wife"
4,former Advanced Stepper - Very Good Workout,"I am 27 weeeks pregnant. A former aerobics instructor who loved very advanced step routines. Now, several years later, I am having a great week when I exercise 3x a week. So, I am not in tip top shape, but good enough.I hated the DVD version of this tape when it arrived during my first trimester. Today, as I prepare to enter my third trimester, I like the workout and I'm glad that I did not return it.Here's a breakdown:Warm-up is on beatStep Routine #1 is off beatStep Routine #2 and #3 are fine.There are lower body exercises (standing leg workout) and two upper body exercises (exertubing).In addition, there is an ab and kegel section.I just finished this workout and I really enjoyed the simple but effective modifications. The workout uses the length and all four sides of the bench."
2,A little off,"After seeing so many high ratings I was disappointed with this video. I don't know whether to step with her or with the music, she is extremely off rythm. She even confuses the girls behind her a couple of times. And does anyone else see the humor in the facts that the largest lady was replaced after the second ""water break""?"
2,"Boring, poor sound , not for beginners.",This video is not for beginners I even tried modifying it myself but it didn't work. Lisa doesn't consider the fact that you are working mirrored to her wich makes it very difficult to keep up with. Also she looks very pregnant on the cover but in the video I don't even think she is. The sound was horrible and annoying her voice has this echoing sound that drove me nuts. I would recommend for everyone beg.to adv. the Kathy Smith Pregnancy Workout and Leisa Hart's Fitmamma both are way better. The only reason I gave this video two stars is because the lower body toning was great. And this might be good for advanced people.
2,Too complicated!,"I really enjoy step aerobics and was excited to try this pregnancy workout. I am surprised at how complicated the moves are for a pregnancy workout. This workout is much more complicated than my Kathy Smith Step Workout video and the step aerobics community class I took. The instructor goes too fast and does not give enough instruction before going into a new move. With all of the fast turns and diagonal moves, I found myself tripping over the step! This workout seems to defy common sense for a pregnant woman with a changing center of gravity. I think I will save this step workout for after my pregnancy when I am ready for more of a challenge. For now I will stick with more sure-footed pregnancy exercise routines."
3,A good workout BUT...,"the instruction is some of the poorest I've seen on a professional video. Lisa Stone has almost no sense of rhythym, so she is hard to follow. In several places, her movements have no relation to the music, resulting in uncued lead-leg changes, etc. She occasionally gets her left and right mixed up, and points in the opposite direction she wants you to go- even her back-up steppers can't follow her! If you are an experienced stepper and can get past all this, you'll get a high-energy workout."
2,Save your money!,"I am an avid step aerobics person. This tape is old style stepping, a lot of lunges, repeats, and unfortunately not to the beat of the music. I also found the rythme to be too fast for any step class, let alone a pregnancy video. I would recommend using a regular step video and just modifying it for your pregnancy capabilities. Best of Luck!"
2,Stepping was too much for me,"Maybe you won't be, but I was too clumsy to step while I was pregnant. I was tripping all over the step and just gave up on this video. The music wasn't all that great either. After I had the baby, this workout was too easy."
1,Not worth the money,"I am a dedicated Firm workout fanatic. My doctor told me to ease up a bit on the workouts and forget about squats and lunges which are staples in most of the Firm tapes. So I bought this piece of [junk]. It would take all 9 months to learn the steps. It got my heartrate up, but I would fall behind at every step. Literally. A good brisk walk or run is as good. It's free, it's easy, and it's not as annoying as watching this tired old tape."
4,Good workout,"While the instructor certainly isn't perfect and the music leaves something to be desired, this is a fairly vigorous workout for an intermediate stepper. It certainly makes me feel as though I've had a workout. The step combinations are not difficult if you are fairly new to step. I also like the leg conditioning exercises. I would recommend it."
4,"Finally, some of pbs' great songs, but we want more!","I ordered this cd when i saw it listed on amazon, not knowing what it was (a collection from pbs 1969-1973), a collection or a new disc. That's how i feel about tom rapp and pbs - there is something absolutely magical about the tunes and the approach. I've loved them ever since i heard ""These Things Too"" in 1969 (I was 10 yrs old w/ a hippie brother). Then I heard ""Balaklava"" (their masterpiece) and have been a different person since. This is a wonderful disc with many of the greatest rapp songs (snow queen, if you don't want to, the jeweler, rocket man, etc) and one new to me - instrumental - ""from the movie of the same name"" - beautiful! So, I love this disc. My complaint? (and reason for only 4 stars) - no ""the man in the tree"" - my most favorite, and i'm scared that with this out, they won't re-release ""these things too"" But it is a great album."
5,an outstanding collection that is long overdue,the long awaited cd is finally here. an essential part of anyones pbs collection. tom rapp is one of the finest lyricists/poets of this or any generation. this collection of songs is also a great way to introduce the uninitiated to the magic of pbs. thanks tom.
2,Foul smell,"Really wanted to like this as it seemed these IQAir units are the best. After plugging it in, immediately noticed a very strong plastic-like odor. Assumed it would go away after a few hours. Well a few days later and the smell is still as strong and really unbearable in the nursery we put this in. Just read the other reviews for some of the other IQ Air products and saw that some attributed the smell to the V5 filter. Seeing as how this unit doesn't have the V5 filter, it must be something else. I will probably run it in the basement for a few more days to see if the odor works itself out and will call IQAir to see if they have a fix but if not this will be returned and will probably look at the Austin Air purifiers instead."
1,Not what it was.....,"Up until a month ago, the AP World was worth the cost. Previously there were a lot of headlines and some detailed stories. Now there are very few stories when you receive the updates. If you are depending on this for world news, forget it."
3,decent but no photos,seems to be updated nearly every day but there are no photos which seems a bit blah. (as one article was titled AP Photos) but had no photo...
1,I would like a concise news briefing and instead i get opinion pieces,"i thought ap would just provide a concise and objective news briefing. Instead I get opinion pieces, pretending to be analysis, that take sides on conflicts going on in the world. They don't even pretend it's a wire service news briefing, which is what I was hoping to buy. I will cancel this."
1,Cheap storage bench,"This storage bench was fairly easy to put togther. We got 3 years out of it before...it just started to fall apart. The sides are just stapled together. When you try to put it back together the wood splits. The hydraulic piece, that is connected to the lid and the left side panel, blew the whole side out. There's no way to secure it without splitting all the other pieces.We are throwing ours in the trash!!!!"
2,"So far ... ... ... possibly good, possibly not good","I read the other reviews before I ordered this storage bench, and figured I'd risk it. I had no problems connecting the backs and sides (the holes all appeared to be properly drilled, and the bolts & connecting devices all worked. Then I tried to attach the lid. I attached the hinges to the lid, then attempted to attach the lid to the body. Uh oh, here I've run into the same problem as most of the other reviewers --- the pre-drilled screw holes for one of the hinges were off by at least half an inch. Now I'll have to drill new pilot holes. What a hassle. If this works, the bench will be acceptable. If not, what a pain."
2,"Great appearance, but difficult to assemble","The storage chest arrived in a timely manner and looks great. However, when assembling, the holes didn't match up and had to be redrilled. The hinges weren't right, and we had to buy different hinges. It wasn't worth the hassle!"
2,You get what you pay for.,"I opted on this storage chest because I didn't want to spend the money on a teak chest. I found this one, thought it was attractive and large enough for our needs. It took 3 times as long as it should have to assemble. The pre-drilled holes did not line up. We had to purchase new hindges. It arrived with no slated bottom for ventilation. We called the manufacuturer and they are supposed to ship us on one. We'll see if it arrives. I don't recommend this product unless you're willing to work to get it together. The quality is a little cheap as well. But if you're not that picky, then it should be just fine.Noted Added 08/28/04: The manufacturer shipped out the missing part promptly. We are pleased with their customer service on this product."
3,great outdoor box but needs a bottom,Bought this 4 years ago and it is still in great condition. Need to keep it treated if you are in the South hot sun.The only drawback was that during the first winter the field mice got in thru the bottom and took up winter residence in the deck cushions totally destroying them. The next year we but a solid bottom in and we have not had the problem since.
3,Cedar bench - a good product and thanks for the heads up,"If it were not from reading other reviews about difficulty in aligning pre-drilled holes for assembly, I would have been very frustrated. But , with the confidence that this was a manufacturing error, I was able to re-drill the offset and assemble the bench without much difficulty. (Instructions are quite small also so be patient and do not rush). The cedar bench is sturdy and fits five large cushions. The bench of this size was hard to find as other boxes that stated sizes were limited by design to only fit four cushions at most. This design fit the cushions without much compression."
3,Still waiting for it to be shipped.,"This review is for shipping only. I have not yet seen the tv so I can't comment on that.I ordered the tv on March 23rd, over two weeks ago! Every few days I check if it's been shipped.... not yet. I keep thinking it must be something to do with the super saver shipping options (free), but I've read other reviews and those have went out much sooner.Free is good, and I'm still patient, but the wait should be better conveyed to the purchaser."
2,WHERE'S MY ORDER??,"I would love to rate it if I only had it. I ordered the tv on March 27 and it still has not been shipped. For the last 72 hour they have been saying that it will ship within 24 hours. It has now been almost 3 weeks since I placed the order and they have not even shipped it. Also, there is no one to call to lodge a complaint or to ask questions."
2,Dissapointing,"Hi,Ok, so the camera was AMAZING the first two days until I dropped it into the toilet in its case. Now, obviosuly this is my fault. It dried out and I brought it in to a camera specialist who said it was fine but I feel the pictures were not as clear. So now it is just sitting here on my desk and I can't use my $400 camera. But the camera was great...i don't recommend buying this porduct online. You can't send it or take it back."
3,Memory Card ONLY WORKS with Sony computers!,"I am no technical guru like most other reviewers, however I am thrilled with the operation of my camera, and the quality of all of the features I researched has not let me down.This being said, my frustration is that neither the Sony website nor other websites which provide information about and reviews for various cameras (Amazon included) highlight the fact that the Sony Memory Stick Duo is ONLY compatible with Sony computers. Yes, the use of USB connector means you can upload your photos onto any computer, but it's not nearly as convenient.I am not sure I would have bought this camera if I had known this."
3,Good but beware of limitations,"I have had this camera for 8+ months and used it extensively. I have had plenty of experience with many other digital and film cameras.Its main pros:+ small size (internal zoom helps)+ good looks+ silent operationCons:- very noisy images, smudged by the camera's noise reduction- very bad and overly strong flash, overwhelms subject indoors- useless red-eye technology- relatively short battery lifeBasically, this is a cool party cam. For most images, esp. indoors, I need to edit with Photoshop or some other program to eliminate red eyes and fix exposure due to flash issues. The images cannot be sharpened (unlike say a Canon) because of the aggressive smudging from the noise reduction algorithm.I like this camera but many a time I wish I had bought a Canon digital elph instead."
2,blurring images,"I got this camera January 2006 and I'm so disappointed with it!Images are never sharp. I called the manufacturer and they told me trying new sets in the camera. I've tried so many things and can't get a good image.However, I give it 2 stars because i've been using the camera as a camcorder, and works pretty as a camcorder!The other reason why i gave it 2 stars is because two months ago, I dropped and somebody stepped on it and it still works ahahaha it's amazing!If you want sharp pictures, do not purchase this camera.I have an older (2004) SONY DSC-P73 , 4 megapixels and the pictures quality are a LOT BETTER."
5,Sony cybershot,"I am a novice photographer.This camera makes a genius out of anyone.Went away for a week, using a 1 gig card, and came home with lots of space for more pictures, and lots of time on the battery, even though it felt like I was taking pictures non-stop."
3,sony dsc-t9,"Pros: very slim and easy to carry, user friendly functionsCons: Unsatisfactory pictures indoor,lots of noise,white spots from air dust reflected from the flash"
1,"Nice Camera, but breaks easily","This was a nice camara until it reached 2 years of use. An error message came up, focus seems broke down. Camara was not dropped or anything. I searched online, and found a lot people having same problem, some saying by hitting the side of it might get rid of the error message, but it didn't work for me. Don't buy if you looking for something that you can use for a longer time period."
5,Sony Cybershot Digital Camera,"Fantastic product, but even more fantastic was the vendor's customer service. I highly recommend both the product and the vendor. Even in spite of a miscommunication which I think may have been my fault, they were quick and very professional."
3,"states 18m+, but is actually 3yrs+","haven't used it yet because although it is listed as 18m+, it actually is 3yrs+ as indicated on the packaging ... so won't be using for a long time!"
3,TMI on Italian Wine,"Although I loved this author team on past ""Dummies"" wine books, this one was a bit tedious. In the authors' defense, Italian wine is a complex and pervasive topic. The book covered every wine region and wine style in Italy and is not a book to curl up with, but rather one to utilize as a reference guide. It would be an essential piece of travel gear if one were going to Italy."
2,Good for small churches with PowerPoint,"Decidely aimed at small churches that are new to technology, Media Ministry Made Easy is a quick and easy book for the techo-challenged.The book is very one-dimensional since it lacks any useful advice on audio or lighting, instead assuming that video projection is the most important aspect to media. Unfortunately, this is an inaccurate assumption that will leave even a mildy technology-aware person wanting more.For those just getting started with video projection, this is a worthy book, otherwise, save yourself the time and money."
2,"Great book, for grade school kids 5 years ago.",This book has all old material and is outdated. I would recommend anything from Len Wilson and Jason Moore or Anthony Coppedge over this book.
4,Wig head review,"I rec'd this strofoam wig head quickly through the USPS. It arrived packaged well, and there were absolutely No defects. Now, I don't have to put my wig on the oscillating fan any longer. lolThanks,Marti GoucherPortland, Oregon"
5,Great Item,I purchased this for my children who had been at a museum and the theme was styrofoam wig heads. They have had so much fun putting their own creative artistic touches to them.
3,Wig Cap (One-Size),"I got a female head instead of a male head so it was patently offensive to have my wig on this while company was in my Passenger room on a Russian Tanker. Material is cheap grade foam. As a side note, this is very buoyant if the ship capsizes.Wig Cap (Black) (One-Size)Adult Blonde Johnny Costume Wig"
2,Poor JVC Support,"This receiver unexpectedly turned off during the warranty period. It was more of a distraction than a problem, so I decided not to bother JVC with a repair request. After the warranty expired, however, the receiver would not stay on. So I wrote to JVC, explained that the problem surfaced during the warranty period, and asked if JVC would therefore be kind enough to repair it within the warranty. In response, JVC's ""Customer Care Coodinator"" (Betty Sierra) told me that JVC would charge me full price for both parts and service to repair the receiver. She also structured the arrangement so that I would have to ship the unit outside of the city in which I live and, to boot, pay the shipping cost.I have written JVC and asked for reconsideration of this decision and will update this posting with its answer."
4,Good but big,Its kind of big for me. and it looks not that fine i guess is the plastic looking and the switch its got.
5,Engaging,"Picking the book up for the 1st time can be intimidating...(must weigh 5 lbs). Well written, engaging, slips the technical details in an easy to swallow form for military history neophytes. Does not pull punches when he switches from fact to his opinion on war patrol performances. Keeps footnotes to minimum, almost like reading a novel rather then history."
3,American Woods English Garden Bench,"Purchased bench as a gift for foyer of local high school, expecting high quality and easy construction. Some difficulty putting together because some holes not drilled deep enough & others slightly out of alignment (stress on grain resulted in split in wood month later that had to be repaired. Appearance of completed bench would have been beautiful had it not been for one arm of bench being completely different color than rest of bench(well beyond natural shade variations in wood). Think inspection or quality control prior to packing would have prevented these problems. On positive note, bench is made of quality wood, nice finish and very sturdy. Would consider giving school matching bench as gift if could guarantee same embarassing problems would not be repeated."
3,Good for me. What I wanted. Worth the price.,"I had just one screw comming thru the seat. No problem. I just backed it out a little. I glued all the slats, tightened all the screws, glued all the joints, chamfered the legs, installed spacer-feet to keep the legs dry, and wiped it down with 50-50 turps and linsead oil. Now it will last forever and it is a part of me. I like the natural and varied wood colors. After all, this in an outdoor bench... think casual and earthy."
4,A delightful romp through evolutionary and behavioural economics,"Sam Bowles never fails to please. Not only is his writing style clear and eloquent, but he also conveys mathematical ideas with rigour and nuance. For those yearning for an introduction to evolutionary economics, look no further than this book and Herb Gintis' ""Game Theory Evolving."" The mathematics is not overly advanced, and someone with a university-level knowledge of calculus can grasp the author's main points. If you are a micro-economist, then this book absolutely must be on your shelf.My only complaint would be that there is no accompanying solution manual. There is no point in books having problem sets without even partial solutions. That being said, this book is superb in every other way."
2,Not good for economic textbook,"I'm an economic major and this book is use in our ""Price Theory"" class. Most of the student in this class, including me, agrees it is not a good textbook. The author just keep on blathering about the topic and hardly showing any examples or applications. How are we suppose to learn about the topic? Today, I just made two books purchase, ""Price Theory and Applications"" by Landsburg and ""Price Theory and Applications: Decisions, Markets, and Information"" by Hirshleifer. Hope these two new books can shed some light on this course."
1,cacophony,This song seems to be searching for a melody and never quite seems to find it. The backward lyrics in the background adds to the overall discordant muddle. I'm a big utada hikaru fan but lately it seems her voice and songs are not at the level they once were.
5,Passion - A New Utada,"Passion marks a transition into a new phase for Utada Hikaru. Her music is becoming more subtle and sublime. Gone are the days of clear, simple, but beautiful melodies such as Deep River, Final Distance, and Colors. Now, with Be My Last, Passion, and Keep Tryin', she's creating a fresh, new, unique sound that ties her ability to create memorable melodies with a more ambitious, complex, and developed style."
3,Does what is says...,"You definitely have to use a tripod and keep it very still. The quality of the picture was not great, but it was what I expected from an inexpensive lens. For what I would use it for it works perfectly fine. I don't think it will be very effective for action shots because it doesn't do well with any movement; although, the description says action/sports shots...I haven't tried, but with any movement the picture blurred quite a bit. It should be used for those wanting a closer shot of stills that doesn't mind a little less in quality, but a lot less in price."
4,A Silver Screen Cinderella story,"I purchased this movie on DVD because the synopsis sounded like something I would enjoy. After watching it I have to say that I really enjoyed this movie. It was light and airy and well casted. June Allyson was adorable, Robert Walker was charming and Hedy Lamarr was lovley. I really loved this movie and would recommend it to anyone who just enjoys a good fairy tale movie every now and again!"
2,Missing the spark.,"This movie seems to have a sweet plot, but somehow fails to come across as a well done film. Like nowadays when one watches indie movies, one can really see why Hollywood movies are so good and make it. Well, this movie comes across as an ""almost but not quite"" in my humble opinion. It is from the Warner Brothers Archive Collection, which is definitely hit or miss. And I think this one is a ""miss"". But suffice it to say, that the movie centers around a young man who works at a hotel and is trying to save up enough money to buy a radio. His girlfriend as portrayed by June Allyson is an invalid and he reads her fairy tales. The princes is portrayed by Hedy Lamarr who and the young lad by Robert Walker. Many of the elements are present for it to be a good movie, but it just doesn't seem to quite make it. Maybe I'll try again sometime with this one and see if I change my mind, but for now I can't give it a very high rating."
5,A serious read for serious disciples of Christ,"Like every book from Oswald Chambers, be prepared for Biblical Ethics to hit you right between the eyes! In my lifetime the term ethics has had so many qualifiers added to it -* situational ethics...* biomedical ethics...* wartime ethics......as though ethics becomes something changeable if you are in a difficult situation. But in clear, unequivocal language, Oswald Chambers brings all ethics back to the Bible.Keying in most frequently on the teachings of Jesus from the Sermon on the Mount, Chambers helps us get to the true intention behind the ethical requirements of God's Law. For any who would say, ""But it's too hard to figure out what Jesus actually meant,"" Chambers replies, ""When we come across something we don't like, we say we don't understand it; it is too plain not to be understood.""This is not light reading, but it is valuable reading. Serious disciples of Christ will be well-rewarded by reading and studying the wisdom in Biblical Ethics."
2,"If you were there, it's O.K; if not this leaves a lot of questions","If you already have a good grounding in the ""Sixties,"" this production isn't bad.The problem is that it really is more 1964-74 rather than the ""Sixties."" It glosses over many of the events, and if you have the background that's O.K. because you KNOW the necessary details. But, if you are mostly clueless about the times the necessary background to understand why events are occurring is arguably sparse.I also find the use of current era talking heads from 1990s to explain what is happening is a bit distracting. We had fine news coverage in the 1960s. Why not use that footage to explain the times and supplement it with comments from current social commentators, rather than do it in the reverse as this production does.For those who want to relieve the days, it's an O.K. piece, though a bit shallow. For those who don't have a clue and want to understand what happened, I'm afraid it will leave them a bit lost."
3,"Great paper,,,not double-sided!","Five stars for paper quality, one for packaging accuracy. Average three.Received my paper today as expected and when I opened it, it was single-sided, luster-finish photo paper. I checked the label and it stated that is was the double-sided matte paper that I ordered but the contents stubbornly continued to be photo paper.Definitely a factory issue since the order selector selected the right product based on packaging.I guess I'll just keep it since it is great photo paper and will update this review if I decide to try ordering again. I may just order the Epson presentation matte paper instead."
5,The very best CD of Laura!,"A different style of singing, kind of middle oriental, with respect to the usual work of Laura. It is a real jewel that can't lack in a the house of a good collector and neither in that of a good Laura's fan."
4,external storage for on the go people,"Has a major shortcoming for me.I telephoned Epson to ask abput the compatability with my Canon EOS Ds1.I was told that it was fully compatible. However I find that it only stores the JPEG images and not the Raw images.On the Canon EOS Ds Mark 11 it is fully compatible.Otherwise it performed perfectly on a recent trip to the Norweegian Fjords,where I took over 1000 images,backing them up quickly even though it was only the JPEG images..it was still an insurance to have the second backup to my Laptop."
5,Perfect For Me !!!,"Love the Epson P4000. It's perfect for me. I have been afraid of a computer crash for sometime now. So I have been backing up my photos on CD's. Talk about taking a long, long time! I arranged in folders (just the way I wanted them) and loaded into the P4000 about 4000 pictures in about 4 hours. Everything worked just perfect, which is a very good thing for me as I am not a computer geek. I have not used it for video clips or audio and do not plan on doing so. Therefore I can not comment on the use of the P4000 for those applications. I can't wait for my next trip as I can now pull this little gizmo out and show people I talk with my pics of Africa or Russia or China or even my little dog !!!"
3,Problem with WA compact flash cards,"Epson has admitted to me that all their storage devices have problems with loading WA cards e.g. Lexar 133x, Told to watch for a fix."
2,Epson P-4000 Multimedia Storage Drive,"Once you have loaded images into the drive it works very well. The pictures are crisp and easy to see. You can organize pictures in folders which is useful but not initially intuitive to do. It gets easier with more use.A major complaint is that the drive does NOT accomodate all cards. For instance to use a memory stick duo, you must have a CF adapter. Problem...they are very difficult to find, if you can find one! Sony has discontinued them. Some other brands are available but not in USA markets. In addition the adapters are quite expensive.I found this misleading and problematic given one of the cameras we use.The newer units may take care of this but at a higher initial purchase cost"
2,Ency OHS 4th ed,Disappointed compared to 3rd Edition in terms of organization and searchability. unwieldy. wish I had kept previous edition.
5,Extremely useful guide to investing in funds via the www.,"Not only does the guide whittle down the methods of investing in mutual funds to the few sites that are actuallly worthwhile, it includes a good overview of mutual fund investing that any layperson could understand. One of the few books written on how to make use of the internet that you will actually find worthwhile, and containing information that is not of historical value only by the time it went to press. A must-have for any new investor, or any seasoned investor that wants the internet has to offer him/her"
4,Horse quotes,"Where can you find horse-related quotes from Mr. Ed, Napoleon Bonaparte, Plato and Mark Twain? In ""The Quotable Horse Lover"" by Steven D. Price. You'll be amazed by the number of people who had something to say about horses."
5,A Love of David Kirk,"I have been turned on to David Kirk since the birth of my youngest son who is now 2. Jake was given ""Miss Spiders Tea Party"" for his second birhday and we have both fallen madly in love with Miss Spider and David Kirk's exquisite illustrations. Little Miss Spider was a book I purchased just to complete Jake's set of books by this author and I do believe I love it the best. Little Miss Spider touches the emotions of any mother,adoptive mother, grandmother, aunt etc.. It shows the real meaning in being a mother and what makes you a mother. The first time I sat and read it with my husband I cried. It is the sweetest story of finding your mother I have ever read. The illustrations are fabulous as usual for David Kirk. I truely loved the feeling I got from reading it. Enjoy!"
5,Wonderful message for children and adults,"As a mother of 6 children, 4 biological and 2 adopted as toddlers, I feel this book presents a powerful message about seeking and finding love and acceptance in non-conventional places. I have been searching for books for our 5 year old adopted daughter that reinforce the fact that her adoptive Mommy and Daddy truly love her and will care for her even though she ""grew in her other Mommy's tummy"". Because my daughter is Hispanic and my husband and I are not, the subtle issue of the differences between the beetle and the spider were not lost on her. The first time we finished reading ""Little Miss Spider"" together, she threw her arms around my neck and with tears brimming in her eyes declared, ""You're my favorite Mommy forever and ever!"" What more could any parent ask for? My biological 11 year old daughter says to tell you that she loves ""Little Miss Spider"", too!"
1,Poor message for adoptees,"Unless your adopted child came from a home of abuse or neglect, this IS NOT the book for you. I cannot believe the messages about birth parents in this book, or the idea that an adoptive parent is there to save you from abandonment and harm. It's an okay book on its own, but as an adoptive parent I can say this book will NOT be in our library. We have more respect for our daughter's birth mom, and we're not saviors to our daughter. We're just two of the parents who love her."
4,How Good Little Miss Spider Is For Small Children,"Little Miss Spider is very colorful, which small children usually prefer, the storyline is simple and easy to understand.The characters are great and there is nothing complex about anything. this book is an awsome childrens book especially for little girls with all the cute little spiders, Little Miss Spider being a girl, and she being a baby."
1,NOT recommended for adoptive families,"I purchased this book because of the many high reviews from adoptive parents. However the first time I read the book to my daughter (who was adopted from Taiwan) was also the last time. I was deeply troubled by the last page which says ""For finding your mother, there's one certain test.You must look for the creature who loves you the best."" I believe the implication of this line is that I, her adoptive mother, love her more than her biological mother does. This is NOT a message I want to give my daughter. I have since gotten rid of the book."
5,A Book for Everyone,"I have owned this book since 1999 when it was first published. It is a well written lovely story. I didn't know this was considered an ""adoption"" book. At our house it is a story about someone in need and someone else reaching out to help them. There is no need to decide if it should be for your adopted or biological child; read the book to your children because it is a good story with interesting illustrations and rhymes. This book is a favorite at our house with all of my children because it holds their attention and they can read along with the rhymes (not all of my children are ""biologically"" mine). Any time spent with a child reading a book is time to be cherished not time to worry!"
2,"""Pre-reading is essential ""","As a children's librarian, I was impressed with the beautiful illustrations, thick glossy pages, delightful poetry and script within this story. However, I was a bit disturbed at the message. Specifically when Little Miss Spider was searching for her Mother and found the predator who ate her. I realize that this is the natural order of things in the insect world, but we were wondering if a preschool aged child is ready to deal with these issues. It should be pointed out, that we enjoyed all the other ""Miss Spider"" stories and look foward to future publications."
1,For the adopted child?,"First the good, Little Miss Spider is a colorful and attractive books for that toddler set, and it takes ""icky"" animals and does not demonize them.OK, that being said, Little Miss Spider has a message that was altogether unpleasant for my wife and me. It seems to speak to the children of the world that have been abandoned by their mothers and should seek for love where ever they find it. When I finished reading it, I just added a little side note for my daughter that she need not look other places for love, because she has it here in this family.I don't think that this is what Kirk was shooting for, but it certainly seemed off a little bit to me (and I'm generally pretty open about children books)."
5,mother of an adopted child,"My daughter is now almost 9 years old, we purchased this book around when we brought her home, when she was 18 months old. We have a shelf of books about adoption, and she has always enjoyed this book. We do not know much of anything about my daughter's birth family. From the beginning we have encouraged our daughter to ask questions and we give her the answers we can. We tell her we know that her mother loved her and got her to a place where she could be safe and wait for us. We talk about my daughter's birth parents whenever she wants to. I think some reviewers were too hard on this book. I think this book is a thoughtful gift for an adopted child. I am just glad to hear of all these great families coming together via adoption!"
2,Not what I expected,"I saw the touring version of the Radio City Rockettes in 2002 and was hoping that this CD would allow me to relive the wonderful show. Unfortunately, on the CD there are many songs that were not in the show or were different versions of the songs. If you haven't seen the show - go - don't use this CD as a supplement. If you went to see the show - buy the CD there when it comes in town next. Perhaps they will have a more accurate CD."
3,Meh..,"This CD was in brand new condition and arrived quickly, however it wasn't exactly what I was expecting. I had had another Radio City Music Hall christmas cd for years and loved it, so I thought I would love this one too. But the Santa character that does a lot of the speaking/singing in most of these songs didn't really appeal to me. I guess it is just not as traditional a song collection as the other CD I had. This one was a great deal for the price if you happen to like this sort of music but it didn't appeal to my taste."
5,well done!,"being my second order on Amazon, im still pleased with it's service. this Hard drive was well worth the wait, nd the 50 4x6 glossy blanks was jsut what i happened to be looking for.This market deserves all my stars. I had tracking, which expected my package to arrive on friday, but it arrived today (wed). if there were 6 stars, i'd shoot for it.thanks again!"
2,One of the most dilettante readings I have ever had.,"This book seems to be written for kids. I do not consider myself as techie, but this book is realy fiction reading before sleep:)"
3,Don't start a Ronnie love affair here,"One of the most beautiful albums I've ever heard. Its next to impossible not to get teary eyed playing it. Emotions are just pouring all over the place. But if its so great why a 3? If it has to be judged on sound its a 1, but judging on the character Ronnie and that he would leave us soon you can't help but love it and give it a 5, so get it when you have all of Ronnie's other stuff. Even with the bad sound its a real treat."
4,Higher quality than I expected,"I bought this new Texsport pump to replace a ""DoubleQuick II"" that split down the middle that had lasted only as long as the airbed I used it on. Compared to the DoubleQuick, the Texsport is massive and much more robust in construction. Judging by size, the Texsport may pump slightly more air volume per stroke. The only advantage the lighter DoubleQuick would have is to fit in a backpack and weigh less than the Texsport. For home or RV I would choose the Texsport.This pump has two hose connections, air out and air in. Air in for deflating every last bit of air, making it useful as a decent manual vacuum pump.The only downside is that on my unit, on the down-stroke the internal valve does not reverse until half way down, thus giving 1 and 1/2 air pumps per push-pull cycle."
2,Doesn't reduce redness,"Even though this cleanser felt great on my face, it didn't reduce redness at all. That was my purpose for buying this product. I'll stick to my Dove."
3,Sort of works,"I have been using this product for a while, and at the time of applying this item it definitely seems to lessen the redness from rosacea. If this product would permanently reduce rosacea, I would be very happy to give it five stars, but sadly it does not, it only temporarily slightly reduces it. I am still thankful Eucerin is trying to help with rosacea though and hope they continue to improve their products."
4,Great for calming skin..,"I purchased this product about 3 weeks ago. I've had a great experience so far. It's very soothing and calming to my dry, sensitive, blemish prone skin. I have severe environment allergies and my skin is easily irritated. If using a washcloth to rinse, this cleanser takes make-up off well. I will purchase this cleanser again."
3,Gentle but not much help with redness,"I like this product for the following reasons: it is a good gentle cleanser that doesn't irritate my skin, yet my face feels nice and clean when I rinse it off. I also like it because a little (a pea-size amount) is all I need for each use. It doesn't seem to affect my rosacea redness, however, and I would say it hasn't had any effect on it, despite my having used it morning and evening for six months. I also use it in conjunction with the Eucerin's redness relief soothing night creme which is a nice light moisturizer. I thought using both products might have more results but it hasn't. It is a good cleansing regime so I will continue using it until I find something that helps with the redness."
3,Soothing Cleanser,There is a soothing effect but I did not see any change in eliminating the redness.
2,Didn't work for me,"This product made my skin really dry. After I use it I can see dry patches on my cheeks and forehead and it appears that my skin is peeling. It also did not reduce redness. This product may work for some, but was not helpful to my sensitive skin. On a positive note, it doesn't sting or irritate my skin."
2,Burned my face,I have eczema and I tried this product because the cream is excellent for my skin when I break out in hives. Because the brand is known for making products for those with particularly sensitive skin I decided to try this product when I found out my favorite face scrub was discontinued by AVON. I bought this product for its cleansing properties and not for redness relief (I have dark skin). The product did not agree with my face at all. It burned my cheeks and left them rough and dry. If you are a person who is sensitive to lotions or cleansers with harsh chemicals or perfumes like me avoid this product.
3,Doesn't do what it claims it does,"This really doesn't do anything to reduce facial redness. Also, I have sensitive skin and it was drying for my skin."
5,Gentle and Effective,"Continuing my search for products that do not irritate my sensitive, combination skin or cause me to break out, I have found this Eucerin product to fit the bill: non-drying, non-irritating and non-comedogenic! I use this in conjunction withBuf-Puf Reusable Gentle Facial Sponge, 6 Pack(a little cleanser and water on the sponge; gently use on dry face) and it also removes make-up well.Highly recommended!"
3,Eucerin Soothing Cleanser,Delivery went well. The product is good. No complaints at all. I will probably order it again for sure. It works during thewinter even for me.
1,Not so great....,"I used it for a week and it made my face break out... BAD. So I guess maybe if you have oily skin, I don't recommend this."
1,Redness relief...NOT,"Ordered 3 of these ""redness relief"" products. Hate all three. All other products I own work better. Should have left well enough alone."
3,Redhead with rosacea,"I have very fair skin, and it gets red a lot so I was desperate for something that would work. After using this product for about a year I had to give it 3 stars. It can make your skin feel very dry and can make it flaky. I guess it can work for some but it really did not work that great for me."
2,shipped cables not avalble for my car - did not work,"Great ignition wires BUT they do NOT make them for a Base 1.6l Mazda Protege FYI....just the 1.8l and 2.0s Proteges....I have these in my MX-5 and they are awesome. For use in appropriate engine, especially Mazdas, 5 stars..."
3,Makcie INUS and other,"I will keep this fairly short, I found the book not the best read ever, but it was quite good for the subject matter it contained. I wonder still if Mackies explanation of the ""INUS -condtion"" adequately explains causation. mackie has written some other interesting books this one, is a usful metaphysics book for anyone interested in the subject. it will give you a good opinion. I also suggest that one who is interested familliarize themselves with Armstrong, Wittgenstein,Bambrough, and others to help give a better context for the topics disscussed in the text."
1,Great fun for father/daughter interaction,This is a great way to expand any child's interest in coins. It is easy to fill most of the slots out of spare change and collect some other older coins inexpensively. Well written and planned. Well designed and intriguing to kids.
5,THE BEST!!,"This is the BEST coin-collecting book I've ever seen. It's so fun to try to find the coins to fill it. It's been a great family activity, too. I even gave one as a gift. The book contains great information and fun facts. Some of the illustrations are goofy, but the facts are interesting."
1,Inaccurate and Irresponsible Information,"You can check for yourself because this is based on the ""Look Inside"" option offered. On the ""Believe it or Not"" page the author states ""Good as Gold! U.S. money is backed by gold in a depository in Fort Knox."" This is absolutely not true! Now, I don't doubt they have gold in Fort Knox but it sure isn't backing our currency. So, obviously this is the one to ""Not Believe""! How is a kid to know that? I believe it is very irresponsible to be teaching children this fallacy, particularly in these difficult financial times."
4,Good but not great,"From a mom's point of view, it would have been nice to make a coin book where you can get the coins in the book without using a hammer and glue. The maker did provide a nice book in a chronological linear fashion and my children and I did enjoy the trivia and facts. This book holds a lot of different coins from easy to rare.From a child's point of view (Jayde)! On the time lines it would have been nice if they would have the dates in slots so that I would know which ones to look for."
4,Fun for kids or Adults,I bought this book for me(I'm 27). I love the whole idea of it. All of my coins keep falling out though. I have to keep taping them in there. Only downfall is that coins are constantly updating and there is no where to put them in the book. It's a very fun book to have though.
4,Great starter set,"Got this for my 7 year old nephew. He loves it, and has collected all the pennies & is now working on the quarters. Nice book for a beginner."
5,Great educational but fun activity,"Our 7 and 9 year old grandsons, who are also very sports minded, have loved reading and collecting the coins for this book. What an educational experience for them that is also exciting and fun and something that they can do with grandma and grandpa. All kids love a scavenger hunt and that is what it is like . This adds an additional dimension to their experiences which is so valuable in their development. I will be using the book as a gift for all of our other grandchildren in the future."
5,Kids Coin Collecting Book,"This book is perfect for the beginner coin collector. I bought it for our grandsons, ages 5 & 7 and they loved it. The stories and colorful pictures kept them interested. It covers a wide variety of coins from pennies to dollars so they were not confined to just one type of coin. It is well made, sturdy, and contains a lot of history on US coins so they learn while collecting."
3,"Informational, but a few product flaws","I bought this book for my 11 year old, who was just starting to collect coins. It covers the basic areas of collecting, but some of the coin slots were too small and wouldn't hold the coins, so they constantly fall out. In the dollar coin section the slots were nowhere near big enough. In the State quarter section it is missing the territorial quarters, such as Guam, Puerto Rico and others. Consequently, any coins that don't fit or stay in the book my son is keeping in a jar and looking for another place to display them."
4,A really fun and informational book!,"My daughter and I are enjoying this book so much! Actually, family and friends have all been involved with it. My only negative would be that some of the slots are hard to get coins into without pounding them in and yet still sometimes fall out. Otherwise the information and illustrations are terrific! I would really like to see this updated with the Westward Journey series of nickels! I am also hoping that the author will be providing us with a book like this for the Presidential dollar coins and their spouse coins! It's a fun and wonderful hands-on teaching tool!"
2,Great Idea -- horrible execution,"My seven year old was excited to open this book and spent hours reading it and searching our spare change jars for coins. Then, when he picked it up, half the coins fell out. I couldn't even get many of them to stay in and we haven't even started with the dollar coins yet. We ended up taping the coins into the slots. The level of frustration was huge for both of us and so unnecessary if only they had taken the time to measure the coins and ensure proper construction."
2,Great idea. TERRIBLE construction!,"This book is perfect for this age group. All of the previous reviewers have been right. However, the spiral bound construction, as it is, is ill-conceived. Not sure they expected kids to actually want to LOOK at it more than a couple of times. There's no way it would hold up to months or years of handling. We had to take plumber ties and pull together several ends of the spirals to get it to hold. It's working now, but pretty lame that we had to do this."
5,Really interesting for my 9-year-old,"This was a really great buy. Not only did my 9-year-old daughter gain even more interest in coin collecting, but we spent hours together filling the coin slots with different types of coins, learning the facts about the Presidents and searching everywhere for coins we were missing. My 12-year-old couldn't help but get in on the action also."
4,Coin collecting book,This book was my birthday gift for my son when he turned 6. It was his favorite gift! It's true that some of the coins fall from the slots but my son likes the book so much that he doesn't seem to care. I highly recommend it for kids that like collecting stuff.
5,"Nice, non-bulky power splitter","Does pretty much what you expect. I got this unit because it was much less bulky than any other unit I could find, and in my car (a MINI Cooper) the power socket is down under the center console where there is fairly limited room. Seems very solidly built, holds well in the car's power socket and my GPS and iPod power adapters plug in solidly. And the price is fantastic.I just wish there was a three or four plug version for times I also need to plug in my phone or Bluetooth headset. :)"
5,Exactly what I was looking for,"Works great, but I think you can find a more inconspicuous one for the same price. Shop around.."
3,A bit loose.,"Works well, but I did notice cords seemed to pull out of the sockets and lose connection fairly easily.Served it's purpose, just need to re-seat cords occasionaly."
2,Twin Socket Splitter,"great deal , but one out of three didn't work , not the fuse , not worth postage to return for one . almost a super deal if not for that ."
5,Perfect. Never expected to have such performance.,"I got this router inspite of all the negative reviews. it is cheap so I won't lose much. It is true it is 802.11b series not 802.11g so it is theriotically less speed, but who said that 11mb/s is low speed? If ur DSL connection is less than 10MB so u won't have any problem!It worked like charm, I just followed the instuctions and within 5 minutes I had both my wired and wireless devices working. MAC address filtering allowed me to restrict access to only my PCs and Laptops - I am in a big building so many others might get the signal if i dont block them.It worked all over my 100 m2 flat from wall to wall, even in the balcony.I bet u won't get cheaper wireless network with such features at that price!---------I am editing this review just to say that this item is still working perfectly till now!"
2,A War Driver's Dream Come True!,"I've had the worst time with the people on tech support for this product. First off, they admitted that their MAC filtering doesn't actually filter any MACs. It's a free-for-all. Their ""fix"" was to enable encryption. Ok. Thanks. I just paid for a feature that doesn't work. They said they are working on new firmware to fix that, but shouldn't they have tested something that serious before hand?I had encryption working for a while, but I disabled it once and couldn't get it going again. Their first level tech support reps have bad accents and don't grasp concepts very well.If you want a wireless router that will work right out of the box, this is for you. But if you care at all about the security of your information, look elsewhere. I'm one unhappy customer."
4,Excellent,I just got this Belkin router yesterday (Model F5D6231-4) and I set it up this morning and it is working great.I do have firmware version v2.00.002.It took me less than 5 minutes to get the wired portion working. I have two desktop computers and a color laser printer all networked through this router via another hub.My Thinkpad comes with a mini-PCI wireless card and it detected the router with no problem. I enabled 128 bit WEP and it is picking up signal nicely. I have a two story house and the router is on the second floor. I have signal throughout the house ranging from 2 - 5 bars. I had no problem using the web in the paces where there is only 2 bars of signal through my 3Mb/256kb line provided by charter.net.(...)
2,Go with Linksys or NetGear!,"I've had this wireless router for about a year and I continue to be unhappy with it.The Good News: The wired component is just fine. With Cat5, it has been utterly reliable.The Bad News: The wireless range is terrible. We live in a typical post-WWII, 1200 SqFt house on LA's Westside. Aside from the 3rd bedroom/home office and living room, the signal is unreliable in all other rooms, even the backyard just outside the office's window. There has been no firmware upgrades from Belkin. Ever. The WEP security has been problematic. Even in the room I've never been able to connect up at 128.I say buy another brand. I'm giving this one away and asking Santa for a better unit."
4,"Functional, needs more security","Absolutely no problem setting up and using in built up area. No problem with interference from 2.4GHz phone or microwave operated near client's 802.11b card. Setup was a breeze, 5 min. as advertised, 15 min. total to setup and configure both router and a Netgear card. Security drawback: needs implemented blocking of unknown MAC addresses. Also, turning off broadcast of SSID does not work. This device might is OK if you are not worried about security. For example, in a single family dwelling surrounded by a lot of space (c. 200 feet radius). Not bad for the money."
1,Just Toss It In The Junk Bin,Does not work - no real software - a waste of your time. Good only for target practice. I wish we could give negative stars for a piece of dreck like this.
1,Belkin is just not god for a Router..IT is a WASTE,"I bought this and have exchanged it twice in a span of a week.The router has problems in accessing yahoomail and hotmail and the helpdesk would bnever help me through it.I tried it in my friend's place and it had the problem there as well.The helpdesk ppl would never ever understand this problem and also they haven't put anythign regarding this on their website.I would never ever advise anyone buying this router even though it is cheap.I found out how belkin loses its customer base.. ""IT LOSES ONE CUSTOMER AT A TIME"".I am gonna return this router today ..."
2,Works OK -- but security is crappy at best.,"1. Blocking SSID broadcast is flaky. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.2. MAC address blocking DOES NOT WORK. You can block a known MAC address, but the whole point is to be able block the unknown ones.Tried to make this clear to the Belkin tech support drones for about 30 minutes, all in vain. Heavy accents, poor communication skills and utter incompetence. If you can read the manual, you are already far more qualified than those guys. I am not kidding -- I had to read to those guys aloud from the manual before they actually stopped talking nonsence about what MAC filtering is.No use anyway."
1,"This thing is junk, save yourself the trouble","I bought this because it was cheap and I just wanted to use it as an extra network switch, and possibly an access point later. First thing I wanted to do was change the IP address so it coincided with the rest of my network. By doing this the router gets confused and changes to a random IP. It still works with the settings you had in it before changing the IP but you can't connect to it to configure anything else. If you try to use the ""Access Point Only"" mode, that doesn't work either and the router stops working altogether. In both situations you have to reset it to factory defaults and start all over. Belkin has no fix for this problem, I called them. Their solution was unacceptable and here we are a couple years after I bought this thing and they still haven't fixed it. Buy Belkin cables, stay away from all their electronics with firmware and/or software, they don't support them very well."
4,Works well,"I got this hub to upgrade my security features from my older wireless hub. The addition of MAC filtering, and the ability to disable the broadcast of the SSID, were exactly the security features I needed, so I could drop the encryption.The range: I get marginally more range than my previous hub, so I can now use it without a repeater.The case: Cheap plastic. It's the only thing so far I take away from it. But to their credit they include a base, so I can stand it on end. I can even wall mount it too, but the holes to me seem to be 'backward'.One thing I learned with this hub, is that you DO NOT turn on remote management. I'm on Road Runner, and the administrative functions kept getting locked up by an IP address in the 140 range. It was annoying for a few hours until I figured it out. I think it's the dirty no-good scum hackers/spammers trying to get in. (Make sure you change the default password to prevent access.)"
1,Never will buy Belkin again,"I have had this router for a few years now. Where should I start? Well, let talk about the web-based interface. It is so buggy that it does not work with Firefox. It only seems to work for Internet Explorer 6 and 7, because it seems to tolerate broken Javascript. I would use IE if I had it, but I am a Linux user, so none of the standards-based browsers that I have will not work at all.I actually found were the bug was, but I can't do anything about. This leads to the second issue of support. I sent the issue to Belkin support, but there was never a response. Checking their support site, there is no firmware updates for this. None at all.So, here's the scoop on what I cannot do. I cannot set any WEP keys, because buttons you need to use to apply the settings silently fail. Therefore, I cannot have a secure wireless, which makes this router useless to me.I am sure that the newer products have better support, but I think I will spend my money on a Linksys WRT54G."
1,A terrible router overall,"This router was my 2nd router of 4 in a long history of using Belkin products. I trust their cables & adaptors, so I thought I could trust their wireless products. I was wrong. First off, the web interface doesn't work with Firefox properly, doing nothing when you click buttons, etc. The firmware update(which will never happen it seems) takes forever to tell you there's no new update. I recently switched back to this model after my netgear wireless router failed, and it just wouldn't work. The ""connected"" light wouldn't come on, nor could I even use a Cat5 connection. Just keep shopping around."
1,BELKIN CUSTOMER SUPPORT IS THE WORST!,I have had this router for about a year. Whenever you call they always say it is an issue with the DSL service provider. No help at all. Does not work with my wireless laptop. Totally useless. I am throwing away as soon as I get my Linksys. Will never buy another Belkin product. When will these companies learn outsourcing customer support to other countries undermines their reliability.
4,Good but a looks a little cheap.,"This installation kit works very well and was easy to install but is made with fairly low quality plastic. I would recommend this product to someone wanting to install an aftermarket deck, but be warned, it isn't pretty."
3,I was disapointed...,"I have to say, I was one of the many people who upon hearing the awesome single ""dont call me baby"", anticipated future releases from this duo. I finally heard the album was coming out, and rushed to the store to pick up a copy. I loved the creative artwork and the overall theme of the album. I think its wonderful that Madison Avenue wrote every song on this album too. But what isnt wonderful is that out of the 13 tracks, there is actually only 7 songs. 2 of the 13 are remixes of tracks, whose originals also appeared on the album. The remaining 4 tracks are interludes. Of the 7 songs, Cheyne (she's the girl) only sings on 5. ""Fly"" and ""78"" both feature different vocalists, and its stated in the credits for the album. The album is composed of mostly of sampled disco loops, which can get annoying on some songs. Dont get me wrong, I think the 7 actual tracks on this album are great... but I would've like to have had more for the price I paid."
1,Empty product.,"For those of you who don't know, Madison Avenue in New York City is the heart of the advertising and marketing world, which makes this group's name entirely appropriate - all label, no content. This is clearly just another prefab ""ghost group"" manufactured out of session performers by European producers/scientists (like Black Box and Culture Beat before it) that will never be heard of again after it rakes in enough dough for its creators. There is certainly no artistry, soul or personality going on here... just 7 hollow rip-offs of Crystal Waters tunes and a bunch of filler interludes and remixes. If you're wanting the one genuinely infectious cut, ""Don't Call Me Baby"", buy the single or ""Platinum Hits 2000""."
3,"2 great songs, the rest bad","I'll make this short and sweet. ""Don't Call Me Baby"" and ""Who the Hell are You"" are some of the catchiest, most fun techno dance tunes. Unfortunately the rest of the album isn't worth anything. The 3 stars are entirely for those two songs."
3,At least you can dance to it,There are actually only about seven songs on this album. All the other tracks are remixes or one-minute interludes or whatever you call them. This cd is best listened to when you're in a club or a dance party.
4,"Not perfect, but very handy","I've had this extension trimmer for a little over a year now and it's still running strong. It does get a bit unwieldy due to it's size & shape and it would be really nice to be able to use it without the pole also. However, for pruning big, tall hedges it sure beats dragging a ladder around and climbing up & down. The fact that it's cordless is great for remote areas of the yard and it's so much quieter than a gas trimmer. Overall it's a good product that does what you'd expect it to do."
5,High up Hedge trimmer,I have found this item to exceed all my expectations and I recommend thistool for all home usage.Michael Curtis
4,cordless pole hedge trimmer,"This trimmer is helpful in reaching further than my regular B&D hedge trimmer, but it is heavy and a little hard to maneuver. It does make moving the ladder multiple times less necessary (not unnecessary). I have used it several times and have not run out of battery power. My only complaint is that I don't really thnk the 10ft reach is true. Overall, it is a good product, however."
5,No more cord! No more ladder!,"If you use a ladder to trim your hedge, or have duct-taped a pole to your existing trimmer, throw them both away and buy this hedge trimmer! Sure, your arms get tired after a while, but, that can be fixed with a short break. Even with that time spent staring up at the sky for a moment, you still cut your trimming time in half!"
1,Review of cordless pole hedge trimmer,I was psyched when I first got it as it had great reach and I could finally reach to cut down my over grown hedges. Problem is it had no power and could only cut the very smallest branches from the hedges. Within about 5 minutes of use smoke started pouring out of it and it quit on me. Bummer as it was a great idea. Too bad it doesn't really work.
4,Useful Yard Tool!,"Tool works very well for the purpose. Could use a little more reach though, must struggle a little to get the higher branches. Battery charge holds up great. Can get a lot of trimming from a single charge."
1,Big disappointment,"I was so excited to get this. My hedges are about 10' high and 10' wide. I only need to trim them once or twice a year at the most so it didn't make since to spend the money on a comercial one. Then it came. It is heavy and flimsy. It did reach the center of the hedges that I could not reach with my regular hedge trimmers but, after about five minutes it started to smoke and smell and shut off. I let it cool down and tried it again and the same thing happened. I sent it back and am waiting for my refund."
3,B&D Cordless pole hedge trimmer,"Very nice for hard to reach hedge trimming. The tool is a bit heavy but workable. Only good for small cuttings...larger twigs will jam the blades until they become ineffective.There is a lot of plastic on the blade part so the tool is obviously not meant to last. It seems to be made for light trimming which will probably allow it to last many years. I usemine on trimming ewue bushes which may be easier than a real hedge.I do not recommend it for anything bigger then 1/8th inch. It will cut larger twigs at first until it damages the blade which will start jamming all the time. If you want a realpole trimmer that works well and lasts, look at the "" Stihl "" tools. These have the basic pole which you can add different tools (weed wacker, hedge trimmer, pole saw)."
2,"good idea, but limited trimmer","This trimmer - does not extend - it is basically a trimmer on a non-extendable pole. This makes it pretty usless in tight spots. It's balance is off, and the trimmer can not be used without the attached pole - it would have been simple to make it convert to a small trimmer (less the long pole). I like the convience of a cordless trimmer, and the trimmer does its job. I just think this product could be so much better. Pass on this until they do some redesign."
4,Pole Hedge trimmer,"Tnis trimmer performed about as I expected. The battery did not run out of power in the 45 minutes I used it, so that was a plus. I was using it to trim under brush especially oriental bloodroot which is a tough vine with stickers on it. I have wild azaelas mixed in with the weeds and the trimmer worked well at getting close to the good bushes without cutting them. It works to about 3-4 feet into the brush, beyond that it gets too heavy (I am fairly strong, my wife could not trim more than a few minutes). All in all, it did what I wanted. I have used it about 45 minutes at a time (twice). I wear out before the battery."
2,Nose-heavy bulkiness.,"Have been a landscape gardener for over 35 years. Was looking for a non-gas operated pole hedge shear. Didn't want to deal with noise and weight. Need pole trimmer for middle of top of established large shrubbery. Very disappointed with awkward design,handling, and weak performance. Couldn't imagine using this tool for any length of time. Literally used it for only minutes on middle of shrub. Other then that, will sit on the shelf. Good idea but poor engineering. Buyer beware. Glad of low money investment. Still waiting for a well made and designed electric pole hedge shear."
3,versatile but heavy,"This is generally a good product. I really enjoy not having to use gasoline or an electrical cord. Product does a better job of trimming than I expected.Battery charge lasts long enough to do consideralbe work. It is a bit heavy and can be tiresome when trimming higher branches. Also, a little additional lenght would be useful. Perhaps another 12 inches or so."
3,Works great but very heavy,Great tool. The only complain is that it is too heavy and you can't really carry it around for more than 30 min or so. Not recommended if you have problems with weights.
3,Black & Decker NPT318 Cordless 18-Volt Pole Hedge Trimmer,"Love Black and Decker in general. However, the length of this item makes it difficult to handle. This is NOT a chainsaw although one would not want the weight associated with a chainsaw. Just don't try to get this unit when you need a chainsaw. If we had seen this unit in action prior we would not have purchased. We were only trying to prune a ficus hedge about 12 feet tall with the unit. Rating ""C""."
4,A useful tool for high hedges and shrubs.,"I saw this tool in a Black & Decker outlet store and held it out to see if it would be manageable. The store had a reconditioned one for $60 and I took it home. Then I read the reviews, many of which sited the weight of the tool. I kept it for days without opening the box and then went back to the store to see how manageable it is with the battery installed. I am 82 years old and wanted to be sure I could manage it. Finally I decided to try it out. Well, I am 82 and managed it and I am not a muscle man. I used it for a minute or two at a time on a couple of high shrubs. But if your arms are not in shape, it would be more difficult. (I exercise regularly). I've also had the pole chain saw for three years and found it very useful."
4,"Very good, but needs more power","I have used this hedge trimmer several times and it does work quite well. My only complaint is that it could have more power for slightly thicker twigs/branches. 18v just doesn't do it and 24v or even 36v would be a great improvement.The adjustable trimmer is a great feature, I've used it and I like it a lot."
4,Black & Decker NPT318 18-Volt Cordless Electric Pole Hedge Trimmer,"After having used manual hedge trimmers for years, I decided to lay down the money and go electric. I can't say enough for the time that this hedge trimmer saved all of us. After I talked with my brother about it, he used it and agreed that it was worth far more than its cost."
3,Not as described.,This item is described as having a 10' reach when it is only 6' long. I CAN use it but it is heavy and awkward to operate.
2,one word...HEAVY!,"I purchased this because my arms would burn from holding my regular electric trimmer above my head, well this helps with the reach but it weighs at least 3 times as much as the electric version. Wish this one was electric at least that would eliminate the battery weight. It's also a little awkward to handle because of the weight and balance but it does reach where my normal one doesn't. I use my normal trimmer to do 90% of the work and then pull this out for those hard to reach places.So just be ready for the extra weight, I was rather shocked and it I would have seen this in a store I probably would not have got it for that reason."
3,Hedge Trimmer-Duty Only,"I was both surprised and disappointed by this product:Surprised: Battery lasted plenty long (it only comes with 1 battery) to do periodic trimming of my modest yard. Considering it's rather bulky and heavy, I think the battery would outlast my arms. The adjustable angle is quite handy and easy to adjust as is assembly/disassembly.Disappointed: It claims up to 7/16"" branches. This a joke. 1/4"" is max, and if two branches enter the blades, it will jam. When reaching up high, it's awkward to unjam. With larger branches, it tends to maul rather than cut. Because you need to support the shaft, the usable length/reach is really only a very disappointing few feet longer than a normal trimmer. Not much pole benefit.For well under $100, I am satisfied. For $100 or more, this is not worth it. You're mostly paying for the battery convenience. Black and Decker products have proven to me to be ""light, household grade tools"" and then die after 6 months to 2 years of use."
1,hedge trimmer,This product did not work well at all. It was to heavey to use.It jammed up the first time I used it. It did not have enough power. I charged it for the required time . I have another B&D cordless hedge trimmer that works fine.
5,A bit heavy but does the job well,"Has a bit of weight that will require rest breaks if you're not in the best shape. I'm 60, in reasonable physical shape and do not find the weight to be a significant drawback considering how effectively this product performs. The adjustable angle is wonderful and helps with pruning hedges of various heights. I'll gladly put up with the bit of extra weight considering I do not have to constantly climb up and down a ladder moving it constantly along a long row of hedge. I think this is an effective and innovative product. Good job B&D!"
1,don't buy,The product was defective. Even if the battery charger hadn't been defective (that's why I returned it ) the battery was very difficult to get to lock into place. I would give this product zero stars
3,Not what I expected.,"I thought that the unit would reach up to 15 feet and was surprised when I discovered it only reached 10 feet and not at a 90angle. For a senior citizen like me, muscle strength is at a minimum. The trimmer is heavy and bulky to use, awkward to manhandle, and tires out your muscles quickly. The battery didn't seem to last very long before recharging. I almost wished that it was electric instead of battery operated. My 15+ foot hedges will require something that will cut thicker branches then fit in the teeth of this trimmer. Does a great job on small, thin branches."
3,designed by northerners,"Good price point, cuts cleanly, good battery life and they give you a nice bag to store the unit in which is very thoughtful. However, did not seem to be aware that 'hedge trimmers' are also used to cut ground cover where it can replace lawns and could have provided a handle and calibrated length of the unit to make this easier. B&D Social Media Monitoring Team: this is probably a bigger market for consumer-use than hedges!"
1,Way too awkward can't use the trimmer without the pole Stupid!!,"First of all, I am a woman and I do the hedge trimming. I need a trimmer with an extension. I was surprised to find that I had purchased a hedge trimmer that can't be used without the pole.When I put it together the top heavy weight made it way too awkward to wield. The weight didn't really bother me but the poor construction of the unit made it feel as though it would break.I think they need to rethink this whole unit.Sorry for the bad comment because I have always liked Black and Decker for its quality. This is not good quality of any kind.Returning it to sender."
4,Backyard Warrior,"This product does what it says, trims and trims. Great for those high trees and shrubs. If you don't mind the clean up this product can reduce the need for those expensive tree trimers."
4,"Very, very handy","I highly recommend this tool if you have a lot of tall hedges like I do. If you only have short hedges, you might look at other trimmers. I love that the cutting head can be rotated 180 degrees and that it is cordless.The Positives:--------------a) Cordless. This makes it super handy! Didn't think this would be a big deal, but it is.b) Long running time. I've charged my once, and have cut three pretty large hedges so far.c) Rotating cutting head. A great feature.d) Storage bag. Keep everything in place.e) Nice ergonomics. Fits well in the hand.f) Seems pretty sturdy... especially for $100.The Negatives:--------------a)Yes, it can be a little unwieldy on the tallest trimming jobs, but that is what ladders are for. Unlike some other reviewers, I didn't find it to be too heavy.b) Would be nice if it cut larger branches. So of the other pole trimmers can cut larger stuff, but they have cords."
