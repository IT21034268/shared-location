3,sleeping bag,"This bag is advertised as oversize however in the small print inm the discription it says maximum height 5ft 11 in. Thjat doesn't seem to be oversized to me. They also stated that they have jam proof zippers, wrong I have used this bag 2 times and it has jamed 2 times."
5,Great Introductory Text,"Lots of us rely on computer programs to perform calculations in metallurgical thermochemistry, but when it's time to review theroy and assumptions, this is the book to use. It covers (and gives great examples) calculatons of enthalpy, entropy, and free energy. The book also provides a good introduction to kinetic theroy."
4,poetic prose and beautiful illustrations,"A young girl sits on the porch at night with her father. When he falls asleep, she takes a ride on the Moonhorse and they fly across the sky. The imaginary trip is related with poetic prose that is inconsistent; however, the chalk illustrations are quite beautiful, and introduce a few of the constellations. Lovely book."
3,"Entertaining, but flawed and sometimes confusing","The premise of the book -- that Evan, half-daemon/half human, his father (a daemon), and his cousing (also a daemon) run a more-than-your-average detective agency -- has potential. What prevents this book from being a truly outstanding work in this genre is the lack of a cohesive back story. The book reads like two books stuffed into one, with neither story (the first, how Evan, Badad, and Lirion came together; the second the current case they are working on) given adequate attention. The pivotal relationship in the book, that of Evan and Badad, is not thoroughly explained or explored, leaving the reader with lingering doubts and questions about the motivations of all the characters.In spite of what is missing, this is an entertaining book, with lots of action, and I do plan to read the next in the series."
5,Graet plot!,I really like the story but it would be better if there was another book explaining what Evan was going through before Badad showed up.
1,To Hell with The Daemon!,"This book is so badly done in so many different ways, it's hard to know where to start. That seems to be the author's big problem too: the book reads like some of the worst sequel novels I've seen, where the first hundred pages are spent explaining, in unlovely prose, what happened in the first book. In this case, there was no first book, but the author presents his characters in that manner anyway. The narrative moves with the speed of frozen molasses -- when it isn't moving backwards. Then there are the characters themselves. Billion-year-old daemons who are as tempramental and un-self-controlled as two- year-old kids. This is just really, really stupid stuff. For a couple books that handle similar themes much better, check out Larry Niven & Jerry Pournelle's ""Inferno"" and Steven Brust's ""To Reign In Hell"""
4,Good First Knife Collector Guide,"This was one of two knife collector books I purchased as a beginning collector/seller. I was glad to see a WR Case & Son, Buck Creek, Cattaraugus, Robeson, Remington, and Winchester pricing guides. Also, good commerative price guide and knife history as well."
3,Too Busy Inside.,"While info contained is very accurate, the pages are to busy. Illustrations lack something for descriptive & visual aid.A downloadable version if available might help separate the jumble. JIM S. dba KINVES N STUFF."
1,The Standard Knife Collector's Guide 6th. edition,I am returning this book. It is too involved and wordy for gaining information on knife value in a speedy way. If I wanted reading material for knife education this would be a fine item. But for finding the value on a knife that I have found or wish to buy at an auction or show this book is not helpful.
3,Enjoyable...3 1/2 stars,"Even though this movie is predictable and contains one of the worst lines ever written for a film, ""cab service on this island leaves something to be desired"" it's fun to watch and has some funny moments. Laurel Holloman fans will enjoy it."
5,Feel Good Summer Romance Movie,"For anyone for enjoys taking a Summer extended weekend trip with some of the guys just to drink, get some sun and hope to hook up, this is a great movie. A group of guys go away to some Hamptons style island in the hopes of meeting the perfect woman, while making sure they have a beer in there hands at all times. The idea is to ""derail"" one of their friends weeding plans. A feel good movie that makes you want to plan a Labor Day weekend getaway to an island somewhere!"
4,laurel holloman in FIRST TO GO,"Laurel Holloman was wonderful in this 1997 movie. There are great shots of her playing tennis (she's pretty good at it) and going in and out of the ocean in a bikini. The five guys in this movie, whose close comradeship was threatened by her engagement to one of them and her arrival at one of their good old boys' weekends, were pretty pathetic IMO. Even though it was a slight romantic comedy, it showcased the talent of an incredibly talented actress in her mid=twenties."
5,Tres bien!,"The Frech really love Brasil's singer/songwriter performer Jorge Ben [Benjor}. Recorded with lush arrangements the recording quality is superb. Jorge;s playing and singing are especially ardent and poetic and emotional but also funky soulful. When back round singers join in you become mesmerized as though you are part of a tribe on a special night dancing around a bonfire. Very fine album! P.S. Why do the french love Ben so, because Portuguese is Spanish with a French accent."
4,Exceeded expectations,"I have to admit that I watched this movie expecting it to be horrible. I had not even heard of it when I ran across it here on Amazon.com. My fianc√©e being a Rob Schneider fan, so we decided to take a flier on the movie and get it. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I laughed. Now don't get me wrong this movie is by no means the best that Mr. Schneider has produced but it was good for a few laughs. On a one to ten scale I'd say it was a solid 7.5."
5,Amazing,this is easily one of the funniest movies i have seen in years. the storyline is refreshing and the actors are great.

1,One attempt at a joke spread way too thin,"The basic ""joke"" that this movie seems to be centered around is that in prison, you will be sexually violated. ANd this is repeated over and over and over and over. Does Schneider think that by repeating this, it will eventually get a laugh? It doesnt. But Big Stan becomes a hero when he is sent to prison and saves everyone from this act....because ""it just isnt fair"". Sorry Rob, it still isnt funny."
3,BETTER THAN MOST FILMS OF THIS NATURE!,"I wasn't expecting much from this film that was shelved for a couple of years and released direct to video. Rob Schneider shows he can carry these types of films and also directs this mostly funny, but familiar tale.I've seen many films with a bigger budget fall flat in comparison to this silly and entertaining movie. OK, it's predictable to a point, but what films of this nature aren't? I enjoyed this film much more than I thought I would and I think anyone who enjoys this type of movie will too!The DVD transfer is very good and there are a few extras to fiddle including a making of and out takes. There is also a commentary with Rob. So sit back take out your brain and enjoy!"
2,MOMMY KILLER,"Big Stan (Rob Schneider) is arrested in the opening scene for fraud. He is sentenced to go to prison. Not wanting to be raped in jail, he hires ""The Master"" (David Carradine) to teach him how to fight. In 6 months our weakling Stan is converted into a fighting machine capable of defeating men several times his size and strength.In prison, Big Stan becomes the top dog and pacifies the inmates to the dismay of the warden. The humor consisted of stale prison jokes and pokes fun at Scientology. I found it rather lame and juvenile.F-bomb, brief nudity, crude sexual content."
3,"A different story, with much detail. But a classic nevertheless","This book is a classic. Do not stray from that opinion. However, it is full of much detail, at times excess description. This does lead to some difficulty in following the story line. It certainly is a unique way of telling a story, a different type of narrative. I would recomend it to someone looking for a challange, but to that High School student deciding to read this book because it is the shortest on the list, I'd think again. The details will make you spend more time re-reading and summarizing than it would to read a longer, easier read novel."
3,Inside the heart of darkness....,"Heart of Darkness is a novel focused with strong imagery and the concepts of darkness and light as ""darkness"" is the heart of man while the ""light"" can be civilization as a whole. I found this book somewhat discriminating in the beginning but as a whole it has a very clear statement. I can see how it is one of the greatest novels but to me Marlow, the main character, has no character as he becomes obsessed with Kurtz and can instantly become him but does not. After finding what he is looking for, Marlow is still filled with the darkness. Even though I thought this book was somewhat interesting, I would not recommend it because I did not agree with Marlow's or maybe even Conrad's view of the Congo jungle and life in it with the darkness."

3,Omni-Gel Review,I have purchased this same type of transfer medium in the past and used it once then. I've used this new container once and now remember why I don't use it. The areas where the Omni-Gel is used are raised up from the fashion fabric and definitely leaves your material heavier. That being the case I really am not qualified to review this item. Handy to have on hand if a relative talks about putting a picture on a t-shirt or pillow I have the goop required. Until it expires.
4,Good product,"Purchased this pliers so I could remove the old hose clamps from the lower radiator hose on my 2002 Chevy Trailblazer. The only difficulty I had was keeping the attachment in place on the spring hose clamps. However, after a few attempts it stayed in place so I could complete the job. Nothing broke, and the job was accomplished.Added note 9/3/2012: There was a wire nut included in the package, the purpose of which I have no idea. Sent an email to the manufacturer, otctools.com, and never received a reply. Has anyone found a use associated with these pliers?"
5,Great time saver,I had a lower radiator hose clamp that was very hard to reach & borrowed a friend's Craftsman hose clamp pliers. I liked them but these OTC plier ratchet where the Craftsman ones only lock in one position. Very nice tool to have.
5,OTC4525,"Well built and it works. I wish the lock would have more locking positions, but I was able to get the job done."
1,"Somebody was bored, oh yeah, it was me...","I didn't care for this film very much. I wish independents would get the idea that people do want to see good films, even if they are a bit slow, or take awhile to carry out the story line. I wanted to like this movie, but it never did go anywhere really. I got tired of listening to this character's whining. Constant complaints got old, and the dialogue lacked imagination. This guy was not all that likeable anyway, and never did get much better. I guess by the end he was a bit changed, but by then I no longer cared. Phrases like ""deal with it"" or ""grow up dude"" kept coming to mind. Along with ""loser"", ""deadbeat"", ""lazy"", and ""so you think the world owes you?"". The friend's Mom, and what they do with her is unnecessary, and you are left wondering about her, and if there really is a point to this movie.I can't think of any reason to recommend it to anyone."
1,Oh Dang....,I love the idea of this flick.I really do.But thats it.I like the IDEA.So....you like ships?Rent Pirates of the CaribbeanYou like love triangles?Rent TroyYou like movies about finding yourself?Rent The Last Samuari.But avoid Titanic.
3,Not what is expected...,"Titanic is a flawed picture, with beautiful costuming, scenery, and special effects. However, the script is absolutely dreadful and contrived. James Cameron's ego must be huge if he thinks that he is a writer.The saving grace of this film is the pre-Raphelite Kate Winslet, who totally out-classes her co-star Leo Di Caprio. Unfortunately, even she sounds stunted speaking in an American accent. The supporting roles are good, but are one-dimensional, appearing as caricatures that do nothing but confound our heroes (Rose & Jack).The soundtrack is far better than the film. I bought it months before seeing the movie, and was very disappointed. I had imagined a better film to go with Horner's wistful Irish laments.If you are a rabid-Winslet fan(like myself) or just like epic/disaster flicks, then Titanic is a must-see. Otherwise, rent Jude or Total Eclipse to see better performances by Kate & Leo."
3,Good but not worth for 11 Oscars,"Three stars is enough for unsinkable ship. There're some nice things to remember from Titanic and also some silly things, especially about love story(""You jump,I jump""--You think it's romantic,huh??) Anyway,buy it if you like."
2,Overrated movie,"Jack!Rose!Jack!...is all what I heard in Titanic. I love the last hour when the ship sinking and it deserves 5 stars from this past.Anyway,Jack-Rose relationship,soap-opera dialog and weak plot spoil good things in movie.To be frank,I've seen many,many better films which never won,or even nominated for, Oscar awards."
2,Pretty Bad,"This film proves that teenagers not only have no clue what makes a good movie, but that even some critics and judges have forgotten the same thing. When compared to other grand epics, like ""Ben Hur"" or ""Patton"", this film not only pales in comparison, but it does not even register as being close in any way to those masterpieces in terms of the elements that make a film unforgettable. ""A Night to Remember"", one of the original films about the disaster is unforgettable. The fact it is black and white enhances the chilling horror. ""Titanic"" suffers from a bad script and awful acting, most notably from DiCapprio, who is simply one of the worst actors of this time. Even the made for CBS-TV ""Titanic"", with George C. Scott, surpasses this film in special effects and acting. Only idiots with no taste can watch this movie."
3,Could've been so much better...,"The special effects for this movie are awesome, but the love story is sort of goofy. Cameron copped out when he decided to center the story around Jack and Rose, two characters who never existed in real life. I don't buy his claim that he put in the love story to show how different the upper and lower classes were--he just wanted to fill the theater seats with members of both sexes. What would have been more effective is if he followed the story of ""A Night to Remember"" while using his talent at cinematography and special effects. I bought the video, but I can't bear to watch that first tape. And what's with the old Rose throwing that gorgeous pendant into the sea? That was really stupid..."
2,Titanic,Titanic is the highest grossing movie of all-time and it was pointless! A 3rd class guy saves a 1st class young woman and they fall in love.
1,Not worth a penny,"While the movie is a technical masterpiece, it has a loose plot based once again, on sex. I am not knocking it, but I do not think sex,like in this movie, should be shown to young viewers. PG-13? Should be R for sure. Unless you feel you must cheapen your dignity, don't buy this video. Why doesn't the film industry make technical AND dramatic classics? All the old visual and spectacular plotline movies, such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, are just considered old junk heaps now. Why has my America cheapened itself by settling with low grade plotlines in exchange for good special effects?(Actually, a majority of the scenes look very artificial.)There is my opinion of this so called ""award winning"" movie."
4,Titanic,"Excellent special effects. Good story, but bad casting. Overall a good movie, but worse than Lord of the Rings, which actually deserved the Oscar for Best Picture."
3,It seemed great at first....,"I am an avid movie goer but this wasn't the best picture ever. (See Gone With the Wind, 1939) Why? First of all, all of the moral values seems to reflect the director of this movie. Lots of unmarried sex, loss of morality, and loss of good common sense are depicted in this movie. I wish ""Rose"" was a much stronger character. Is this what you want to teach your kids? If you're not happy, screw around and hope for the best? I think this is best watched by adults. I admit, the first time I watched it I felt for ""Rose"" but the second time, I realized how immoral this movie was. At least Scarlett O'Hara's husbands all died ...respectively....except for Rhett Butler. And that movie did win ""Best Picture"" if I recall.. END"
1,A night to remember; a movie to forget.,"I just read Roger Ebert's review of the new movie ""Pearl Harbor"". He sarcastically described it as the story of how the Japanese made a surprise attack on a love triangle. That criticism is right on, and it applies to ""Titanic"" as well: the story of how an iceberg ruined a steamy affair between two youngsters. The ship, its ill-fated voyage, and the tragic circumstances of the other passengers are completely obscured by the sappy, aimed-at-14-year-old-girls love story involving two fictional characters."
4,Breathtaking and edge of your seat suspence!!,Very interesting. I saw it thinking I wouldn't like it because I don't really care about the Titanic. Now I'm interested and I'm doing research to see if any of my relatives were on the Titanic. I would reccomend this movie to anyone I meet.
3,I thought it was good until....,"I thought this was a great movie until I saw Goodwill Hunting and As Good As It Gets. Those movies were wonderful and I think should have received Best Picture. Titanic was pretty good, but I thought greatly overrated."
4,"Half great, half fair......","I didn't go to the theatre to drool about ol' Leo; I went to relive the horror that passengers felt 86 yrs ago. I was so amazed by the special effects! The acting was not outstanding (exept for the end) but the quality of the film is outstanding! Though I do agree this should be rated 'R' for the profanity and sexualality. Definitly a movie that you should watch because this is something that really happened. In my point of view, James Cameron was trying to let the world recognize TITANIC as a tragic, painful, and memorable night, not only to the survivors but so that everyone could see how a few hours can change your entire lives. If you are one who are rating this movie a one or two star, you probably did not like the script, but you have to admit, it is a sad thing right? See! tHAT'S Cameron's point....to make us realize this is a tragic event. But all I'm trying to say is that, it's really worth watching. END"
3,"A good movie, BUT...","...there are too many flaws to the storyline. I tried to tell myself to stop thinking too much and just let movie do its job, but the most important plotline (the love story) is unconvining and silly. Okay, maybe it's suppose to have that fairy tale feel to it. But I can't believe that they are really in love with each other. I'll say that is a BIG flaw in a love story. Saying this is the greatest love story of all time is a joke. Yes, I cried at the end. But the scenes that made me cried were not from those two. I wish the movie would've concentrate on more different people from different aspect of the society, let us know how it is really like on the whole ship. I'm not saying this is a bad movie either, the special effects were great. And it's worth watching, just not hundreds of times like some people do. This is probably the movie I liked the least out of all the nominations for the oscar last year. L.A. Confidental should definitely have won. END"
2,When all the dust of hype settles down,The movie is just so ordinary when I watched it again on the video some time after I watched it in the cinema. The romance is so affected and vain. I wonder what would happen if its title were not Titanic. It's such a tragedy to our humanity that a secondary school romance like that could win so many coarse people's tears and money.
3,"Bad story aside, Titanic loses alot on the small screen","If you're a Titanic-ophile like me, you loved the historical detail and accuracy of this movie in the theaters. Unfortunately, most of those scenes (most notably the radio room and bridge scenes) were cut out of the home version and we're left with the dreadful dialog and poor acting of the two main characters who represent two of the most self-absorbed and immoral people movie audiences have ever had the misfortune of being subjected to, not to mention the foul-mouthed crew in the contemporary scenes. The movie's imagery loses a great deal of it's impact on the small screen, though it's still a marvelous trip to the Titanic itself. It's just a shame we're forced to go aboard with Jack and Rose."
2,just because so many people saw it doesn't make it good...,"Everyone went to see this movie it seems. There were also the people who saw it multiple times; I was not one of them. I saw it once, and that was enough. I found it to be totally overrated, and I was half asleep by the end of this movie. I also was disgusted by girls my age who went to see it over and over again to see Leonardo DiCaprio (I can do without him.) I felt that the movie dragged on, and it felt like I'd been in the theatre forever. Titanic was disposable; do yourself a favor and get something with some actual substance and good acting."
3,"like the movie, hate the blu-ray.","I have an external blu-ray that apparently needs an upgrade, because it hitches. On this one, with a five days-old HP 4530 Probook, I don't even get that much. The program that comes with the machine worked with some discs, ie, Lady and the Tramp without a problem. But not this one. Further, the Microsoft Office failed to run at all after I ran the disc for the blu-ray that came with the laptop. So I sent it back, and they couldn't get it at Tiger Direct, either. In fact, they wiped the whole drive and started over.Do yourself a favor, and stick with the DVD quality options, as it's been days with this."
4,dvd product review,"Product arrived in a timely manner, however, the dvd was loose from its holder, which made it necessary for me to open the plastic wrap to make sure it was okay.Not too bad a problem, except the fact that it was to be a gift, and I hope they didn't think I just gave them an old, used one!"
5,Superb.,"Beautifully filmed, funny, and well-acted, this film features the story of the Titanic through the eyes of young lovers. It's a love story first and an affecting ""tragedy"" film in the second instance.Very highly recommended."
5,Great movie!!,I already have this movie and purchased for my granddaughter. She saw it in 3D and loved it - am sure you will watch this movie many times. Would recommend it for everybody as is definitely a classic.
5,great movie,"very good picture, the sound is a little weak, but with a surround sound connect to the tv, it should be good"
1,ICK,"Here's my advice: If you like this movie get help very fast. It was so dumb I couldn't stand it. I would have rated it a 0 but amazn wouldn't let me. My favorite T- shirt is ""The Boat sank, Get Over It"" Don't buy this piece of trash."
3,Titanic DVD,"We received the DVD very quickly, and it played with no problems. The only thing is it is in wide screen version and I don't particularly like that version, so I will probably never watch it again. I will see if I can get the full screen version."
1,One of the worst films ever made,"If James Cameron got to the ""top of the world"" with this rubbish then there is no justice in life at all.This is terrible. It is the worst film I have ever seen. A big boat sinks. It looks impressive. I have seldom seen more wooden acting, a film which lacks story, characterisation and drama to life it above the tedious melodrame we are presented with.Ignore the hype, the publicity and actually watch this over-inflated nonsense. It is, quite simply, pure rubbish which patronises the viewer into thinking it is watching a ""good"" film.Cameron, Di Caprio and Winslet should be ashamed of themselves.Awful."
2,What? (continued),"Please allow me to explain myself a little more. What I meant was that two teenagers having sex - BEFORE MARRIAGE - and being very young and only knowing each other for only what? 15 minutes? I am a strong Christian person, and that is just wrong - in fact horrible. The profanity is also very bad for a PG-13 movie. The nudity was also bad to get that kind of rating. This was supposed to be a love story. What? Two teenagers doing so many immoral things - on a ship? Once again, the Titanic sinking was a real tragedy, but why just make the movie worse by making it appeal to teens that will fall in love with the movie and see it 20 times. The world is getting worse and worse every day, so why promote wrong things in a tragic-based movie? I am as perflexed as most people on that question."
3,NEED MORE TITANIC,The movie has good scenes but the least they could do is make a movie today strictly about Titanic only.I was mad when the story was mostly about love but the titanic scenes like the sinking was very good.I suggest A Night To Remember it is black and white but is good and it is all Titanic.
4,Hey ??,"Would have loved to have the DVD but received a region 1 DVD not compatible to New Zealand being region 4. Amazon very good in the error but I assume Titanic is not available for Region 4 yet. Shame, as I paid the US price.Cheers."
3,Unsinkable.....Just,"When i first watched this in the cinema i thought it was good, but we had to watch it with a fifteen minute interval so that spoiled it for me a bit. But i recently bought a copy on VHS and watching it at home is a totally different experience, the title music takes you into the film, (it is so haunting) and from then on you are on a roller coaster ride (sort of). The only thing that James Cameron did wrong was casting Leo as Jack, he looked to young and baby faced to play ""a man of the world"".I also rufuse to buy this on DVD untill there are more extras !!"
1,The Movie should have sank too!,I'm Sorry In a democracy you can have a million idiots and one sane person. Was it me or did anyone else notice the Irish bias and the love story with a ten year old kid! Granted the special effects were great but the script and charactes were cliched and miscast and lacking in any individuality.Awful movie period
1,Hit Fast-Forward!,"Can somebody please tell me why this film did so well at the box office/oscars? At least two thirds of it is complete garbage! This film relies heavily on its high production value and special effects. The characters and sub-plot are two dimensional and cliched, the script is unimaginitive- basically the first two hours of the film are a complete waste of time. However, if you fast forward to the end (a rather foregone conclusion anyway) the sinking of the ship is impressively done, albeit historically inaccurate. Basically, don't even think of buying this film, watch it only once-for the special effects."
1,Only Hollywood...,Only Hollywood could turn the senseless death of over a thousand people into a love story.
4,"Hands down, the 90s finest! End of story!","No movie is going to get a perfect five stars in my book, nor a ""10"". Four stars is perfectly fine (and still not a perfect movie). A ""9"" is the highest possible score any one movie can possibly achieve. In a view of opinion, TITANIC rises and sails above nearly all undistinguished movies of this millennial age. And if you don't like this excellent production, then by gosh, go out and see THE MATRIX! I enjoy all kinds of movies in all different ranges of categories, and this is no big exception! Like what you like, and forget it! The debate is going to go on the same way as the lyrics of Celine Dion's music track."
2,Nice Boat...Lousy Story,"This film disappointed me so deeply that I have lost serious faith in James Cameron as a writer and the current under-14 female crowd as competent human beings for watching this film over and over again like lemmings.Want to know the entire story? Boy meets girl. Boy loses girl. Boy wins back girl. Boy dies of hypothermia.Jeez, and that's it, folks. No, I'm serious. That's it. Having delved into the history of the Titanic, they could've gone into so much depth and detail about so many other things...but didn't. Millions upon millions of dollars making it look like it's actually sinking, and no one bothers to pay even a hack writer $1.88 to touch up the script.I'm giving this movie 2 stars - 1 for the absolutely insane stupid plot, and another for the special effects (mainly, the boat sinking). I'd wait until some big network pays for this monstrosity and shows it on TV."
2,The movie is not all that,"Sorry, don't want to affend any one but, the movie Titanic is a rather horrible movie! When the movie first came out I could not get over it. I was crazy about it. I've seen the movie 5 times...5 times to many. Leonardo Di Craprio, is a really bad actor. Kate whateverherlastnameis, is okay as an actor. I think that they could of made the movie ALOT better! The nudity is NOT called for! The movie would of been ALOT better if they had just taken that part out. But still, the movie would still be a sorry sight. By the 3rd time I had seen the movie I would start laughing so hard during to movie. Everyone else would be in tears, but I would be laughing to death. So, if you have any morals, don't see it."
1,this sux,i cant believe that this movie was even allowed to play in the theatres it sucked so bad cause it was so damn corny i saw it 6 times and each time it put me to sleep this is the most awful movie iv ever seen my entire life!!!
1,Stinky Poo,This is a heart warming romance about 1500 people that die slowly and painfully in freezing water. It is worth seeing though for the ending: DiCaprio dies!
2,A teenage story with a powerful presentation,It is really a teenage story with a powerful presentation. I just could not make up any tears while I was watching it.
3,"fine, not great, fine","So this is as it has been called a tragic heartbreaking love story, but hello! It's called titanic we know the boat sinks and I mean if you haven't seen it before and it's the top seller under tragedy you obviously know on thems gotta die. but that's my critism. my compliment is it's visually stunning, and the love story was great but it's such an obviously plot. If you read this and get the impression you shouldn't waste your time but you want to see a heartbreaking tear jerker whose end is to some degree tragic, and the film is visually looks great with a good love story, see the beautiful prescoius and heartbreaking gone with the wind."
2,Overated,"One word comes to mind pitiful. I could not get through the movie at all. It was also to predictable. You knew De Caprio was going to die. That scene was also tasteless. The girl, way to naive. The lamps that the crew was carrying while searching for survivors did not even exist in 1912. If you asked me, save yourself do not watch."
5,Muy buenos efectos y gui√≥n.,"Es una pel√≠cula estupenda. Desde los efectos cinematogr√°ficos, hasta la m√∫sica, el clima, y el desempe√±o de los actores hace que se trate de una pel√≠cula muy pero muy especial. A m√≠ me gust√≥ mucho y la v√≠ 3 veces."
3,"Good, but once is enough","Greatest of all special effects, lightweight script(you'd think with all the money being spent, Cameron could have afforded to hire people who write for a living). Recently watched the Clifton Webb/Barbara Stanwyck version, funny what a difference a good screenplay makes."
1,RATING FOR THE DVD NOT THE MOVIE,"THIS WAS A SORRY WAY TO DO TITANIC!!!!! I COULD NOT WAIT FOR THIS TO COME OUT ON DVD BECAUSE I LOVE EXTRA FEATURES AND I ""KNEW"" THAT THIS WOULD HAVE A LOT BECUASE IT WAS SUCH A SCCESSFUL MOVIE!!!! BUT NO, I GET IT AND LOOK ONTHE BACK, AND WHAT DO I SEE....NOTHING!!! ONE EXTRA FEATURE...A THEATRICAL TRAILER...I WAS LIKE 'WHAT'??? THIS MOVIE GROSSED 600 MILLIONE! WON 11 ACADEMY AWARDS, CRITICLY PRAISED..ADN ONLY ONE EXTRA...WHAT A DISAPOINTMENT!!! WHERE ARE THE DIRECTOR COMMENTARYS, THE ENDLESS TV APPEARANCES BY THE CAST, THE MUSIC VIDEOS, EVERYTHING THAT THIS MOVIE GOT ON TV SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON THIS DVD. WHAT ABOUT THE AWARDS SHOW? PUT THAT ON THE DVD, SHOW THE CREW GETTING THE AWARDS THEY GREATLY DESERVED...HOPEFULLY, THE PROPLE WHO PUT THIS ON DVD WILL CATCH WORD OF MOUTH ABOUT THIS HIGE MISTAKE AND MAKE A NEW DVD, AND HAVE THE LIMITLESS EXTRAS, FANS OF THIS MOVIE WERE EXPECTING!!!!"
2,Titanical,"I thought Judi Dench & Kathy Bates were brilliant. I thought the movie should have stayed on the tragedy aspect & not the love aspect. If we want to see a love story there is Sleepless in Seattle & Hope Floats. James Cameron however did depict very well the cruelness of the rich to leave the poor & servants on the ship. He also depicted with terrible reality the horror of being in the middle of a freezing ocean, no way of escape & knowing your fate of doom. The poor children dying. It was so very sad. The characters could have been written better. The first movie is much better."
5,best movie ever,"This movie was very exciting and romantic. It had all the literary elements. Its elements included: irony, villian, hero, foreshadowing, analogies, and romance. The cinematography was excellent. Special effects also wonderful. The costumes were brilliant. Best actors were Mr. Andrews, Rose(old and young), and Jack. The recreation of the ship was awesome and in great detail. The music selections could not have been any better."
5,Fantastic in terms of story telling and acting,"I wont go into to much detail of who greating the acting was. It was, all the preforamnce were exaclently done. Dicaprio and Winslet were both excallent and real. But the story telling I think has not gotten all the attenion it deserves. The story telling to me was simply increable and worked exaclently when combined with the actors( captures their expression and movemoents brillantly) the story telling brings to mind Eisenstein. The films emtions are capture through brillant story telling that makes every thing seem vivd. Along with music and cinematography and the excellant leads the film is vivid haunting and lyrical."
1,Oh Well...,"Oh well, no one is going to read this review anyway (like it really stands out above all these 869 others!), but I thought for such a huge budget they could have made a much better film."
1,"Obvious, Melodramatic Dreck","If you stuck this movie on one television and then right beside it you had another television playing 'Pearl Harbor', I would immediately commit suicide.'Titanic' is complete melodramatic dreck that the makers should be ashamed for making, the actors should be ashamed for performing in, and the completely braindead movie-going public should be lynched for making this film the number one all-time box office grosser(its ahead of freakin 'Star Wars' for godsakes). Ugh. It makes me ill just thinking about it.Why would anyone even care what happens in this movie? Its got a lame cast, a lame story, and you pretty much know how its going to end. And don't even get me going the extreme lameness of the soundtrack...ugh, Celine Dion. I'm glad that that skag made so much money off of such a horrible song. I hope every person who bought that album or this movie gets ebola."
5,Titanic: The best movie I have ever seen.,"This movie is perfect for me. It has an adventure and it has love. I just love the love story that they built around the plot of the sinking Titanic.This is how the story goes: Rose is a wealthy girl of high class who wants adventure. She boards the Titanic. On the ship, she tries to commit suicide, but Leonardo DiCaprio's character, Jack Dawson persuades her not to. They spend some time together after that and they fall in love. He gives her the adventure and life that she wants. Then, the Titanic, which was thought unsinkible, sunk. The rest is really very sad.The story is beautiful. I highly recommend this movie."
1,1 Star for software form not the Movie,"Whoa, $10 for the Titanic DVD, what a bargain. HA!! As others have said, it is sorely lacking. Just the movie, no extras. And to add insult to injury the format is widescreen _letterbox_. I watch DVD's on my laptop and this is torture. All the beautiful scenery in this movie squeezed down to almost nothing. What were the publishers thinking??? I truly hope they will re-issue this in fullscreen and with the extras that most other DVD's have especially this incredible production. <rant mode off>"
4,Titanic,"Finally! The Titanic is on Blu Ray! It only came out in 1997. I just want to scream. "" I'm king if the world!!"""
1,An Atrocious Movie?,"Okay, it wasn't that bad. I would have given it maybe 3 stars based on it being a sappy story with impressive effects and excellent costumes and set design.HOWEVER - this movie has the most atrocious, mindless, badly written dialogue of all time. It was NOT in any way true to the period which was not only incredibly distracting but it would have been SO easy to fix. It was badly paced, badly acted and grated on my nerves to the point where at the end, when Leonardo does the cannonball to the bottom of the Atlantic, I had to laugh out loud! Just so I wouldn't have to hear him talk again!If you enjoy period pieces with elegant, refined or even remotely historically accurate language, this is not the movie for you."
1,Titanic waste of money and time...,"To put it succinctly, this movie is a completely unoriginal, cliche ridden piece of garbage. The dialogue is some of the worst I have ever heard. The romance is sickly sweet and utterly predictable. If you want to see some excellent period piece-type romances try something like The Age of Innocence, Dangerous Liaisons, or A Room with a View (particularly excellent!). At least these are well acted and well written. Titanic is an overly hyped completely commercialized stinker with a capital ""S""!"
1,The Source of All Evil In the Universe?,"Trite, boring, formulaic, eye candy with neither soul nor wit. I GET ANGRY when I think about this piece of trash. Angry that so much money was wasted on this infantile pabulum. Angry that it was so well received at the box office. Angry that it garnered all those undeserved Oscars which should have gone to better films. And above all, angry at its bad example; that the greatness of a movie should not be measured by its budget. Did James Cameron sell his soul for his success? It would explain both the film's artlessness and its good fortune."
4,Titanic,I purchased this DVD as a birthday gift for my 14 year old grandson who is very interested in the Titanic. It was listed as being new and arrived in very good condition and was quite reasonable. It arrived in a timely fashion.
1,stupid,This movie is really boring. At first it was really good but then as time went along it got ridiculous!
4,Nice,Wife has watched the original many times. this upgrade is nicely done. will get to watch it many more times.
4,"Great movie, 3D underwhelming","Like everyone I had seen this in the theaters way back when and still loved it this time...unfortunately the draw for me was the 3D adaptation which was underwhelming...when I watch this movie again, it won't be with the 3D on...after watching this, I've lost all faith in movies that are upscaled to 3D...if you want a real 3D experience, watch a movie filmed in 3DWas upset when I received as the cardboard pocket for the Blu Ray case was falling apart, glue was coming off...as well, the price of the DVD dropped by $10 after I bought it. After a long online chat with one of the representatives, they offered me a $5 gift code which is ok"
2,Titanic DVD,This was purchased as a Christmas gift so I cannot really rate it until it is opened and used. All I can say is it arrived in a timely manner and looks good from the outside package! Sorry!
3,Great film but.....,"I thought that this was an excellant film.Beutiful scenes. Excellant acting by the supporting actresses and actors. Beutiful costuming. Great special effects.But it could have used a little work. Deleting all scenes with DiCaprio and what's her boobs would be my first recomendation. Would have improved the film greatly. I would also delete the class bigotry. The scenes of armed stewards shooting passengers have long since been disproven. Many rich men chose to go down with the Titanic so poor women ahd children could live. many men chose to die, shouting 'women and children first'. The first officer also deserves a little respect.Otherwise a great film.A trival goof. Tommy Ryan wasn't a passenger. He was one of the crew. A steward. Two other Ryans, Edward Ryan and Patrick Ryan were, both third class. None of them related."
1,I'd give it 0 stars if it let me!!!,The effects are bad and the acting is worse. The storyline is a contribed bit of fiction set against the most overused topic of all time. Its predictable so much that you don't even need to see the last 1/2 hour. Which is good since its almost as long as Gone With the Wind (a good movie by the way). If you enjoyed at all in the theatre you'll get bord with it by the 3rd time.
1,Where Did They Come Up With This One?,This movie was absoltely stupid in this movie they did not once teach a history lesson of the Titanic bad actors bad script to much love if your lokking for a good action/history Titanic movie this is Not fort you!
5,Worth the price,"Bought this movie for an Uncle that kept asking for it, did not know what to buy him for Christmas and this was a great gift. Til this day now, he claims to watch it atleast twice a week."
2,IT STINKS,"Horrible. The only good part of DeCapprio's performance was his drowning scene near the end. The only other good part was the drawing scene which gives the movie a pair of stars, but that is it. Flush it down."
1,THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE,"The greatest. It combines the horrible tragedy of the Titanic with a timeless love story. It makes me cry everytime. The only problem was during a scene with Jack and Rose taking a walk on the deck, there was a little speck or a sort of flicker in the corner of the picture. Considering this, Titanic is definately the worst movie ever."
1,Can I rate it below one?,"From the very begining I cannot to see Leo drowing down into the deep frozen and blue sea. Not to mention the old lady who instead thinking of her big grandaughter welfare thrown away a million dollars necklace.And what about the lack of respect of Leo and Kate running into the engine room, playing while all those poor sailors are working hard? If I were the car's owner where the disgusting love scene happens I will be happy that the Titanic remained under the water.About Leo's paintings. NO COMMENTS.Guess what music was listening Titanic's Captain before he crashed into the iceberg....,that's right!!! Celine Dion & the Royal Mantovanian Orchestra!!!!!If you really like Titanic's Story, you can't miss the film with Clifton Webb, simply marvelous."
2,time for titanic to sink!!!!!!!!!,"this movie was OK but terribly overrated! this movie could have easily been 2, it just keeps going and going I almost fell asleep watching it. dont waste your time or money on it on it. and by the way leonardo di caprio u suck!!!"
2,Flaws,Finally watched movie. There were 2 separate spots on DVD that stopped the movie and was very hard to get it playing again. Missed parts of the movie because of it. No reason for a new DVD to do this.
1,i hate this film,"I hate this film ! It is nothing but tripe, when I first heard about it i was interested, a movie about the greatest ship disaster of all time. But when i looked deeper and found it was not so much about the Titanic itself, but more on a Bulls*** love story well that lost me for good i have suffered through it ONCE and ONCE only! I will never watch it again and will certainly never own it!!! Just a shame i cant give negative stars"
3,"Great effects, marginal story","I must have been among the last 1% of the population to see this movie, having only seen it for the first time a few months ago on DVD. The special effects are impressive and the movie does succeed at capturing the magnitude of the catastrophy. That said, I'm at a loss to explain how this movie became the mega hit that it was. Cameron does a fine enough job creating a tale that blends fact with fiction, except that I just didn't find the whole love story all that compelling, much less plausible. The movie's success is certainly a testament to the combined power had by all the 15-year-old girls in the world."
5,Gloria Stuart was robbed! The best film ever!!,"Any great movie depends on the story, any story depends on the teller. Ms. Stuart voice and eyes conveys every nuance of emotion. Why the Academy gave the Oscar to Kim Basinger is beyond me. Anyhow, this is a film for the ages crafted, well thought out, with excellent acting, costumes, computer animation and wonderful direction.The tragedy of Titanic's sinking will always remind people not to think too highly of engineering achievements."
5,One of the BEST Romance movies ever!!! Thumbs UP!!!!!!!!!!!,"Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane and Victor Garber star in the theatrical hit of 1997: TITANIC. Leonardo DiCaprio was terrific as Jack Dawson. Kate Winslet was so-so in this movie. Billy Zane ( Cleopatra, The Phantom and Pocahontas II) gave a slamming punch-in-the-face performance as the gentlemanly jealous Cal Hockley. Should have won 2 MORE Academy Awards: Best Actor (Dicaprio) and Best Supporting Actor (Zane). I LOVE the song My Heart Will Go On; it makes me cry because it means something personal to me. Why wasn't the song In My Arms Again by Michael W. Smith used in the movie? GREAT picture."
2,eh,"i have to say that anyone giving this movie 5 stars is BLIND to the fact that this movie is just like every hollywood movie. a lot of time and effort was put in this, but what about feeling? NONE. it's just eye candy for the guys, and a cheesy, unrealistic love story for the Leo girls to shove down their pathetic chick flick filled throats. how can anyone expect to get a film with feeling and real emotion from the guy that directed the Terminator? come on! the acting was good, but cheesy and over done, and in some cases not done enough. sure i felt tears in my eyes, but that's just because i'm still vulnerable to Hollywood's false emotion."
3,It's just a movie!,"If you see this movie with the mindset of ""I'm just going to sit here on a rainy day and watch a movie"", you'll be fine. But if you go into it with the idea that you are going to see the greatest movie ever made, you're going to be incredibly disappointed. The love story plot is mediocre at best, and the movie doesn't seem to get interesting until the boat starts to sink. Everyone knows how the movie ends, but unlike, say, Apollo 13, which keeps you interested in the characters despite knowing the outcome, Titanic makes you wish that both Rose and Jack would end up frozen in the Atlantic. I've definitely seen better movies, but on the other hand, I've also seen much worse. I think James Cameron should stick to movies like Terminater, but that's just my opinion."
1,"Too Long, Bad Story","This movie was way too long. The only really good thing about this movie was the costuming and the special effects. Plus the story is completely unbelievable: a person who has never handled an ax in her life can accurately chop a metal chain in two and not remove an arm? :there was room on that raft for both of them. :a street rat cleans up that well and has manners that good? I'll never ""revisit"" Titanic."
1,AWFUL,THIS WAS THE ABSOLUTE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN IT WAS A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME AND WE ARE NOW ALL DUMBER SITTING THERE FOR ALMOST 4 HRS AND WATCHING A STUPID MOVIE
1,Big boat sinks. Dialog stinks.,"This is a disaster in more ways than one. Best (or worst) line from the movie: ""We have to stay on this ship!"" Acting lessons for everyone, please."
1,Fine example of Hollywood pap.,"The appeal of this movie - and its success - lies with the pre-pubescent teens, and unfortunately, adults with the emotional and intellectual faculties of an immature teen, who saw this movie over and over again. Mind-numbingly vapid and so heavily stylised for the 90s that it bears no resemblance to the actual event - or the era. Sure, one is supposed to suspend their sense of belief when watching a Hollywood movie - but not their sensibilties!"
2,Excelent sinking scene,"If you really want to see talent on the part of little Leo, see ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"". I would never rank it as high as ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Star Wars"" and its trilogy, but i will say this, skip the first tape and just go directly to the second one. Don't waist your time on the cheeziness of the first tape."
3,"OK film, but once the hype is over, it gets a bit boring.","Yes, some of you people out there may think myself a little crazy for giving a film like this 3 stars, but it does get boring. The first time I saw it I was amazed, especially by the special effects. But the second time I saw it with my grandmother (me only being ten) I found it a bit boring. It doesn't really dazzle you that much. It's nice to see once in a while as a treat. The part which always stuns me is the sinking. A must to rent."
2,Where's Clive Cussler when you really need him?,"It's amazing that Titanic has received such praise and glory...True, the sets and special effects are incredible (it does, after all, take a lot of research to get the clothing and scenery right for a period piece), and the movie brings out some horrifying points (like the treatment of those in the ship's lower holds)...The love story between Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, THE attraction of this story, should really have been left out, or at the very least reworked to make the characters full-fledged adults...I'm no fan of Celine Dion, either...I'm almost Titanic-ed out, but I will offer one suggestion...Read Clive Cussler's breakout novel ""Raise The Titanic!"" Not only is it more enjoyable, but it's also more fun..."
5,The best movie ever,I think titanic was the best movie ever made. There is waonerful acting. It is a great love story and it has great special effects.
2,Defenitly not the best.,"Baisicially,Titanic is okay,but the whole ""Leo"" thing is annoying. All the ""Leo"" worshipers make the movie embarissing to see because it is pathetic knowing that half the girls in the movie theater are there only to see Mr. Cute himself. But, other then that the second part of the movie is safe to see without barfing.And it is a extra bonus to see all the preps crying there heads off when Jack dies."
2,Not as great as I initially thought it was,"I saw it first in the movies, and though I didn't particularly care for the love story, I was still moved by the fate of the characters. Then I saw it again on Pay-per-view (we have the video, but it remains unopened), and I was not impressed at all. This movie certainly does not rank as the best of all time and it did not deserve all of those Oscars. I have agreed with previous choices for Oscar winners, but this was ridiculous. I guess you could call it a travesty that such good pictures are made and ignored and drivel (yes, I said it) like this takes home all of the prestigious honors. James Cameron had already proven himself to be an excellent director, but I'm upset that he was recognized by the Academy because of this movie. Not worth it."
2,"Fine visual effects, spectacularly terrible in other ways","This film has a paradox while also being the highest grossing movie of all time (sad isn't it, that it beat out Star Wars, I mean episode 4). Jim Cameron's direction isn't that bad actually as he sort of sets a good story up and the always known climax looks really good. Unfortunately, he has a screenplay that makes the Jacqueline Suzan books seem like exceptional writings by comparison. His screenplay, and the actors that act out the scenes are so inept, and bring this epic down so far, that you have to stand in awe of how bad it is near the end. So while there is that, at least some of the visuals are far out and EXTREME fans of Cameron might find some interest. Otherwise, beware"
5,bad good badgood rooster turkey meat cake surpirz!,"this is a bad movie the part where the monster eats the space ship and the guy dies is good and so is the end but the acting (especially from the lead role, Joe shishkabob) is good okay so the acting is not good actually terrible okay good so awful i like the part where the guy gets all the stuff in his head like his liver and fingers are sucked into space this is good and i like crop dusters five headed turd monkey poop heheheheheheheheheheheheheh i said a bad naughty word don't tell my mommy i live with btw i'm 6 hahaha i'm not uzing that stupid kids review stuff haha stupid amizon BY THE WAY YOU CAN BUY THIS ON MATCH.COM FOR 2 POUNDS DON'T BY IT HERE THIS WEB SITE IS GOOYHHOHOHOHOHOHOHOH! qwurd"
1,"james cameron, what happened?","alright, let's get the basics outta the way. While the special effects and disaster scenes deserved all the credit it got, this movie sucks. it's supposed to be a great love story, yet it's about a future wife committing adultry with a bum. plus it had a bad script. hell, i believed Total Recall had better acting and a better script than this. if you want a good and/or historically correct movie, consider watching these: Saving Private Ryan, The Shawshank Redemption, The Untouchables, hell, watch Superman. that's probably more likely to happen than in this crap that evidentally deserves 11 academy awards. If you want a real movie worthy of that much oscars, watch one of the best movies ever: Ben-Hur"
4,Titanic 3D,"Titanic 3D is a beautiful Blu Ray 3D set (which includes 2D as well as a digital copy). I wasn't sure if the 3D would be ""cheesey,"" but it is well done ... a nice addition to the already enjoyable movie. 3d comes in and out (not all scenes or evrything in each scene), but it's enough so that it really jumps out at you and you do feel as if you ""are there."" Price is decent. I'd definitely recommend adding this to your collection!"
5,Titanic,"I am completely satisfied with this dvd. The quality, color, and special features are excellent. I never tire of watching this movie. A valued addition to my collection."
3,Good quality but...,"the only issue i had was the digital copy was only in iTunes, and I do not like that I was forced to using Apple services instead of either Windows copy ir iTunes. Major letdown!! Wish they had an Ultraviolet copy of the film, but I read that they don't have rights to this particular movie from Paramount, even though I heard that Paramount recently acquired rights for their films.. Really? What with 2 parts to the DVD. When I got the original DVD when it came out, it was only one disc. What gives? Other than those gripes, the film was really good quality for a Blu-Ray disc. Would give it 4 stars if it had Ultraviolet, but I guess you can't have everything you want..."
1,about 15 minutes of good story,"waited to see this for free on an HBO promo weekend because i refused to spend the money on it. now i know why. decaprio was far better in gilbert grape. i was told people wept in droves but (and i do cry at movies) it didn't do a thing for me. the language and mannerisms were so out of synch with the period of the movie that it was very disconcerting to watch. plot was very contrived and derivative. not worth the money, the time or the oscars (l.a.confidential and good will hunting, among others, were much better movies overall). 20 years from now will anyone watch this? i doubt it. this was as moving as ""love story"" which also was tremendously overhyped and as deep(NOT)."
1,"It sucked, big time.","this is definitely the most overrated film of all time. If you are note a girl under 14 you can not possibly like it. The special effects last for about 3 minutes, the story is predictable. Boy likes girl, girl has a bad boyfriend, boy gets with girl, boy dies. How original is this? The dialogue is terrible, and frankly I do not think that Di Caprio is really agood actor. tHe only good part is when he finally dies at the end. Finally, I hope I never here Celine Dion's song ever again!"
1,Horrendous,"First off, i've been a historical nut over the Titanic for the past 13 years, and a member of the Titanic Historical Society. And..while the movie accurately depicted the disaster with a halfway decent ship model and a few accurate details, the teen-idol decaprio absolutely ruins the movie. They schould not of thrown in a teen hearthrob that couldent act if life depended on it. The entire boy-meets-girl plot is completly worthless, and various elements mislead veiwers to what acctually happened. I'm glad the Titanic is now a recognised event to all of the public, but this is just horrible..."
1,Overrated movie of millennium,It isn't that good as many people praise this movie.See it once and tell everyone you share experience in the most overrated movie ever.
1,Over Rated,This movie is terrible!!! It makes me angry that crap like Titanic won so many Oscars including Best Picture when it was against great movies like Good Will Hunting and LA Confidential. I lost all respect for the Academy Awards when Titanic won because it shows that money and hype win over everything that makes a great movie. I still can't believe Titanic got more Oscar Nominations than Saving Private Ryan!!! Whats that about!!! I hope the new Star Wars movie kicks some Titanic ass when it arrives in May to show those horny 13 year olds that they don't run the movie buisness.
1,I can't believe that the resolution is so poor!,"The story is kinda OK... I love Kate Winslet and Leonardo is OK, too. I love the storyline and the whole flashback idea. You get so caught up with the story while you're watching that you kind of forget the whole opening sequence, and then... BANG.... you're back in the present. And the effects are terrific... it's sort of funny that they built a 9/10th scale model of the titanic.... what's the matter... the extra tenth would have bankrupted them??? But, hey... Yeah, I liked it. What I can't believe is that the resolution is so poor. They certainly weren't thinking HDTV or 50-inch monitors when they made the transfer. If you haven't bought it already, I'd wait for the next release.... I'm sure there'll be one."
3,"I bought it, but...","Paramount shoud release it again....Great Film...no problems, but poor DVD!Do it again, and I will buy it again..."
3,could be better,"The movie is great, but the DVD is lacking in extras. There should be a lot more behind the scenes stuff. Also, the menus are very plain and should be animated."
5,"Great Movie, 3D is well done",Everyone knows the movie was great.Now we can say that they returned to it and did an excellent job bringing it to life again in 3D.
1,Not working!!!!,It does not play on my LG 3D Blue Ray Player. It tells me that the disc (all four discs) is not compattable with this player. The player is three months old. All the other discs that i have plays fine. Is there anything that i can do to rectify this?
1,poor quality,"when i received the dvd, i noticed that it was all scratched up. and to boot, it skips two huge sections of the film. i cannot believe that something in such a bad state would be sold."
2,ASPECT RATIO,"Did they really downgrade this movie from 2.35:1 to 1.85:1 for the Blu Ray? I have a DVD of this movie that is 2.35:1. If the Blu Ray is, in fact 1.85:1 I will not be purchasing the Blu Ray and will stick with my DVD! 2.35:1 is the aspect ratio in which this movie was originally released in theaters and that is the only way I will watch this movie, in it's unaltered original format."
3,good but not great,"although i dont agree that it is the greatest movie ever made, it wasnt bad either, although decaprio is not my fave , he did an ok job , the reason why i watched it was because i like period dramas, i like kate winslet, and kathy bates, i would say 60% of the movie was good, the only complaints i have are, it was too long,it could have been an hour shorter, and kathy bates could have been given a bigger part ,and i think too much was spent on the film,"
1,Wrong,"This movie is all wrong.It tries to get you to think,Poor Jack,well what the hell..What about the other 2,000 passengers, the best part:When Kate gets slugged, and abused by Billy Zane, also the touching part when Jack dies of Hypothermia."
1,The movie sucked!,I hate love stories and this one just hit rock bottom everyone should of died and Cartman from South Park should of stared in it.
1,What was James Cameron thinking?,"Okay so it's movie magic, and the special effects are mindblowing. Well that means jack-all when it comes down to it. The script was embarrassing. Kate Winslet I think manages to pull it off, but Dicaprio has trouble speaking corny dialogue and wonders why he didn't receive an oscar nomination. After such great films as Terminator 2, and Aliens, I expected a lot more from James Cameron. This didn't deserve Best Picture, it destroyed the oscars."
1,"this movie sucks, big time","this movie really sucks. Did it deserve 11 acadamy awards? HELL NOOOOOO. It is long and boring, thats it"
1,"Heart will go on?? No, life will go on!!","What can I say, the movie wasn't worth a single academy award! The only thing I liked was the bad boyfriend (Billy Zane), who is (compared to DiCaprio) a good actor!"
5,movie,loved this especially in 3 d on my new tv had seen it before but nothing like in 3d loved this!!
4,build a bridge,"titanic...The Movie....Is just that.I enjoy the story, from that perspective.I appreciate the effort to create a level of interest in such an event. Drama can attempt to capture, only you can respond!In reading short 4-5star reviews, and Loooong 2-3star reviews, I believe the connection has been made, as planned!"
3,"Great movie, bad DVD","A great movie with stunning visual effects, but where are the ""extras""? I expected more from Mr. Cameron than what this DVD offered."
1,"Focuses on wrong things, and is poor when it shows the right","I must admit I was taken by suprise by the special effects, but that may be the only thing that makes this movie worth while. A little love story is fine, but why over do it? Besides, movies on disasters should focus on the disasters. This one barely gives any of the limelight to it. I would much rather it use its good points on the disaster. (Poor...not reccomended! Avoid!)"
4,GONE WITH THE....OCEAN,"OK I AM NOT A LEONARDO FAN ; NOT AT ALL ... SO I AM NOT WRITING TO SAY HOW WONDERFULL HE WAS IN THE MOVIE ; THE BESTS IN THIS MOVIE WERE BILLY ZANE & KATE WINSLET (FINALY A REAL WOMAN NOT A TOOTH PICK ACTRESS ON THE SCREEN ! ) AS FOR DI CAPRIO ... THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER ACTORS I WOULD HAVE SEEN IN THIS ROLE... THE STORY IS BEAUTIFUL ; ""EAU DE ROSE"" BUT WELL DONE ; NOT AS GOOD AS ""GONE WITH THE WIND"" BUT IN BETWEEN THESE TWO MOVIES I DID NOT SEE ANYTHING LIKE THIS."
5,Great Message,"This is what I feel is the best movie ever made. Lots of kids, when seeing this movie, think ""Ew! Shes naked!!"" But when you think about it, Back then, The human body was considered a beautiful thing. I'm not saying that you should be upsessed with that part of the movie, but its important to the storyline. Anyway, what I set out to say is that this movie has great message. Just because someones not here with you fisically, dosen't mean there not here. This movies says that Jack will always be with Rose, even though hes no longer living. This movie achives thing no other movie has ever achieved. A great message, a great cast, a great dirctor, and over all, advice everone can learn from."
1,What a stupid movie!,"Wake up everyone! How could a stereotypical movie like this 'make you think'? How historically inaccurate! As if there is any way that a third class passenger in third class clothes could be able to dine with first class passengers or walk on first class decks. The acting was terrible, it was unbelieveable and fakey looking, and for God's sake, why didn't Rose ever get cold? She's only diving into icy waters on the ship going after her beloved honey and she doesn't even flinch! If James Cameron is such a decent caring human that feels bad for those that died on the Titanic, then why didn't he spare us and donate the $200 million he spent on this movie and donate it to charity? He could save thousands of lives by feeding starving people instead of just giving us a flick that's made half the world nuts! I hated this movie and James Cameron is a hypocrite!"
1,HORRIBLE,"This was the worst, most predictable movie I have ever seen. Just because someone spends $200 million on a movie doesn't mean it is any good. (i.e.Waterworld) Why take one of the most tragic accidents in the last one hundred years, add a stupid unbelievable love story to it and make it into a blockbuster? What a ridiculous way to drag down your name, Cameron. Don't see this movie if you have any respect for the dead or their relatives."
1,"Way, Way, Way too long",The whole movie was really boring. It was two hours of boring stuff. Finally at the end there was a little action. It actually was kind of a funny movie. It should be under the comedy section.
1,Horrible; one of the worst movies I have ever seen.,"""Titanic"" was terrible. The love story is old. It is taken from Romeo and Juliet, which is taken from Pyramus and Thisbe. The acting was extremely bad, and the only character who seemed to have depth was Molly Brown, who was also one of the most humerous characters. The movie was too long, and even though there were good special effects, they got boring after fifteen minutes. It is a waste of money to see the movie and I wish I did not spend the $7.50 to see it."
1,Why must movies like this be allowed?,"This is not a love story: it is a 7,000 hour mawkish sentimentality-fest. Crouching Tiger is a love story (and much more), this is just fetid lowest common denominator fare. If you are not bored rigid by the end of this film, kindly raise your expectations."
2,"Soylent Dick Says: Good realism, but Romance plot complete rubbish","The realism aspect of this film - the collision with the iceberg, the growing panic, the lifeboats half-empty, etc were very well done. In this, it seems to follow the 1950s black and white movie, 'A Night To Remember'.But I thought the romance aspect of the movie was the biggest lot of trash I have ever seen. The truth is that a woman of that social class would not have looked sideways as a boy (and I emphasize 'boy') from the lower ranks. Also no woman of that social setting would have been well-versed in theories of psychology as our heroinne was.The most memorable thing about this movie was the Celine Dionne song."
2,Program froze in Last Minutes of Movie - Again,"Program froze again, of course at the worst possible time. I stopped using your service months ago for this reason, but lately, thinking you had fixed it, but no luck. Would appreciate a credit of some $4."
1,Here's Proof that Hype Sells,"Titanic is easily the most overrated movie ever made. A previous customer review said it best: ""the biggest insult to color movies since Heaven's Gate"".Were it not for the special effects, which I begrudgingly admit are quite good, this movie would be awful. The acting is flat, the plot is downright silly, and the soundtrack is painful to hear (""My Heart Will Go On"", ranks right up there with ""Wind Beneath My Wings"" as the worst movie song of the century).Teenage girls went for this movie in droves, which unfortunately caused the MPAAS to get all caught up in the hype and award this turkey a most undeserved Oscar for best motion picture, passing up several more worthy competitors.This movie is truly a triumph of form over substance."
1,the most overrated film ever,the acting had moments and the effects were tight but thescreen writing and the horrible theme song take badly from the film.this film was long winded and overly dramatic.it's a sad tragedy no doubt but sitting thru it for 3 or more hours doesn't hold my interest.
1,The most over rated over hyped film in history.,If you are looking for a boring three hour waste of time this is your film. Romantic- I think not- this is a film that features character so bland and tiresome that after an hour you will find yourself praying for an ice burg or a nuclear bomb or something to put these tiresome people out of your misery. This film is another example of a Hollywood movie that uses special effects in pace of good writing and character. But I lack the energy to list all of this films bad traits- let it suffice to say that my favorite part was leaving the theatre. If you allowed the option of voting 0 stars I would have done so.
1,AN INCOMPARABE SINKING,"I come from the town that built Titanic. Contempoary reactions to the sinking were mainly shock, as Harland & Wolff had an international shipbuilding reputation. This lamentable piece of 3hour-plus tosh is just that- not only because of its imposition of 1990 social mores [Jack would never have met Rose, let alone made holiday-package nude love with her in 1912], but because of its quite intolerable, fake lightheartedness and its lacking in human warmth. The iceberg, when it came at the end of this historically moronic, movie was a blessed relief. One star for the fact that it ended."
1,Evil is afoot,"I cannot reconcile myself to living in a world where this is the number one movie of all time. The real sinking of the Titanic was indeed a tragedy, as was the script, the acting, and everything else about this movie. I don't know if I've ever witnessed such horror on film before. If someone was really as self-centered as the fiancee is supposed to be, would he continue chasing them around the boat when it's obviously sinking--wouldn't he be more interested in saving his own hide? And I shudder at the spitting scene--there's no better way to cause a common steerage passenger to fall in love with you than to learn to spit with him. What a trooper she was to descend to his lowly level. Ah, it must be true love. I'm just embarrassed for Hollywood, and for all involved in making this movie. Especially Kate Winslet who is so much better than that. Shame, shame, shame on James Cameron."
1,Icy cold,"Impressions: Razzle Dazzle special effects, at least they look good by 1997 standards... Unfortunate foreshadowing: We know Rose can't drown, though we wish she would, because she is allegedly telling the story...Unneccessary scenes: Rose's fiance shooting up the boat, any scene with Leonardo in it, the steamy orgasm in the car, any scene with the old lady, on and on...Most satisfying moment: a frozen Di Caprio sinking beneath the waves...Redeeming social value: The nude sketching scene pushed my honey over the edge...so all was not lost. Otherwise this thing should have sunk like a rock."
2,Damaged bluray case,I received my 3D Bluray of Titanic today. Apparently someone didn't care how it was shipped. Usually I get my movies in a box and they are well protected. This copy had a corner of the bluray case cracked and some of the plastic fell off the corner when I removed the plastic wrap. You guys have been great in the past but I noticed this with a couple of movies I have ordered. This is the first time I am commenting on a damaged item. If this continues to happen I will return the damaged item and go back to buying movies in a brick and mortar store where I can insure they are not damaged.
1,Based on an untrue story!,"A. Doing it in the back of a car is not true love, kids. Jack would've ditched her at the nearest port. Think about it.B. Rose let go, after all. Get over it.C. Go watch Casablanca; your brain won't atrophy just because it's B&W. Now that's a love story. (And the dialogue is infinitely better.)"
2,"Teens Spit, Die","This movie takes a great and moving story, but grafts on top of it a puerile love drama. Too bad!"
1,You have got to be kidding me!,Ugh! This was a recommendation for me! How? This was by far the worst movie I have ever seen. I wanted to give it it no stars but this program would not let me. I could not wait for the boat to sink. It trivialized the true event by turning it into a trite and unbelievable love story.
2,Titanic: Empty Bombast,"Empty spectacles are nothing new to Hollywood, but only in the 1990s could $200 million be spent on an antihistorical treatment of such a recent event. The 1990s are the era of production professionalism --- the sets, costimes, and cinematography are predictably expert --- and null creativity. No disaster is richer in meaning than the sinking of Titanic, the ship built and underequipped on naked human hubris, but direcot James Cameron failed to even notice the philosophical subtext --- or make any other point. Since the original story wasn't exciting enough, director James Cameron added a cliched romance, stereotypical bad guys, and pre-adult social commentary... we should require more of our art."
1,Absolutely banal,I have never seen a more banal film. I'm at a total loss as to how this won Best Picture.
1,RE-TARDED!,"this movie is retarded with a capital R.first of all,Leo CANNOT ACT.I mean,Gilbert Gottfried coulda performed better.And,nearly every teen who saw this saw it it for his looks. EXCUSE ME?!? ARE YOU MENTAL?!? HE LOOKS LIKE A TOAD WITH HAIR! And Kate is no better.And the plot!BEEN THERE,DONE THAT! That cruddy song would have been better if they picked someone besides Celine Dion. She sounds like a coyote! The special effects stink! BTW,a lotta people here say you can't be normal if you hate this. Sorry,but u people have no taste in movies what so ever.I think Cameron paid of the Acadamy and the critics and everyone else in Hollywood.And one more thing that bugs me is the scene where those CGI rats are running away.James Cameron can pay off anybody & can buy anything. i think he could afford real rats."
1,Horrible,This had to be the worst movie I have ever seen. For 3 hours of my time I would have hoped for at least a desent movie. The MOST over rated movie EVERI wouldn't have even given it a 1 star but you have to.!!!!!
5,GREAT MOVIE!,"I'm so sick and tired of people bashing this movie! I'm not even a Leonardo DiCaprio fan, but I enjoyed it!"
2,Masterpiece-But too long a wait for such a disappointing DVD,"Don't get me wrong, behind all the media crap, this is a masterpiece of a movie. We waited soo long for it to be on DVD, so we thought it must be one awsome DVD with lots of stuff like outtakes, Titanic information, Behind the scenes featurettes. Then the DVD finally came out, and besides the tiny video when you pop the dvd in, all it does is play previews, select languages, cene skip, and play the movie. Very dissapointing for such a long awaited masterpiece. I should have just been satisfied with my video of it. Two thumbs way way up for the movie, but two thumbs Way way down for the DVD. Oh well, maybe The Matrix and The Sixth Sense will be awsome!"
2,Not Very Satisfying...Oscars are only given for popularity,"this movie's only good points were the direction and the production and the special effects, and the traces from real-life characters. the actors were awful, and it took 2 hours for the movie to get to the sinking. leonardo di caprio is a bad actor, and kate winslet isn't acting: she is a whore. this movie made me sick."
2,Featureless DVD for an award winning film.,"The film is obviously great and the image on DVD is excellent. But man, this is probably the poorest DVD I've ever purchased. No featurette, no commentary tracks, no production notes, no cast bios, no special effects documentaries, wide screen format only. Very dissapointing. It's just a barebones DVD. I'll be very annoyed if they come out with a full featured edition in the future."
5,"great movie, great company","Of course the movie was great, but, I was astonished as to the quality of the company. Amazon was great in communications, time of release of the movie, and good at time of delivery. I will be anxious to use the company again, and, again"
5,titanic,"I am glad to have this for my collection I love this movie but I bought it for my husband for christmas, the movie works great and my husband we be happy to have it as well thank you"
2,ONE WORD; OVERATED,There really was nothing great about this film the acting sucked the script was cornier then a corn festival and it plain sucked. Wow the special effects were good and it cost a whole lotta money. Does that make it 11 oscar worthy? NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO N ONO NNO NON ON ON ON ONONONONONONONONONONONONONON NO NO NON ON NO NO NOONNO NO NO NON NO NO NO NONONONON NO NO NO NONON NONOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH
2,the best movie of all the time???,"Yes, the Special effects of 'Titanic' were pretty good, and the acting, in particular by Kate Winslet was ok too. But the fictional romance was absolutely not necessary for the movie. There are a lot of scenes noone would mind to be cut... if 'Titanic' would have been shorter it might have been better. Also, I don't know how others feel, but I find it sick of the people in Hollywood that they try to make money of such a sad thing like the sinking of the Titanic."
1,ONE OF THE WORST FILMS EVER MADE,Since when does superb special effects merit an Oscar. Hollywood is so stereotyped and predictable that it's impossible to enjoy movies these days. The titanic is nothing special (the movie I mean) and was only such a big box office draw because little girls get wet to Leo. End of story.
1,James Cameron's genius wasted.,"Most of the time I want to see a movie again and agian, even if I didn't like sometimes, however I never want to sit through the drivel known as Titanic again. First of all DiCraprio can't act at all. Secondly why should we care about the miserable lives of two people on the Titanic when thousands, upon thousands died. The title Titanic, to me, sounds like a film about a great ship, that fell to a terrible demise. Not some love story between two little insignificant people that no one cared about in the first place. The only good part was when DiCraprio froze like a popsicle. Unless your a girl who is obsessed with DiCraprio don't watch this travesty of Cameron's talent."
1,Total utter recycled tripe,"It's sad how standards for excellence have sunk so low as to elevate ""Titanic"" as the best movie ever. I hope and pray that most of the people saying this are immature teenage girls who have yet to know what a good movie really is (i.e. It *can* have all ""ugly"" people in it). This movie is boring, drawn-out, re-cycled from 1000 other movies, crap. The only thing of interest was the Linux-driven special effects which were pretty amazing.Other than that, Leonardo and Kate need to go to acting school, or better yet, get a job at McDonald's or something...poor unbelievable acting from them. YES, they're great looking, but that does not make a good movie. James Cameron should stick to Terminator sequels, at least those movies were imaginative."
1,OVER RATED,This movie was so over rated. I got a pumped up for nothing. The best part of the movie was the credits at the end.
4,Completely satisfied,this was the first time I ever purchased a used DVD from Amazon. I have to say I was completely satisfied with how quickly I received the DVD and the quality is just great. I would not hesitate to purchased another used item in the future.
3,Not Great,"I didn't go to the theater to see it because it was too long, but I knew I did want to see it one day. All the hype got my hopes up. The sinking scenes were entirely too long- that was about 3/4s of the movie. I didn't even cry, like many people told me I would. When I finished watching, I felt like I'd wasted three hours of my time."
3,"Great movie, but no documentary footage",I got this DVD hoping for more actual documentary on the Titanic. Instead it's all behind-the-scenes and about the movie itself. Not worth the extra $$. Just get the regular DVD single.It has nothing but the movie (and trailer). And it's cheaper.
2,Not a bad movie if you fast-forward through the first 2 hrs.,"The re-creation of the titanic (including the boiler and engine rooms) was fantastic and well worth seeing. The story itself, however, was shopworn and predictable and the acting was one-dimensional. In particular, I found it impossible to be sympathetic for Kate Winslet's character. Overall, I was disappointed considering the hype and Academy Awards this film received, and felt that it wasn't worth three hours out of my life to watch it.By the way, couldn't they have gotten a better artist to do the drawings that Di Caprio's character had done (that were supposed to be so talented and promising)?"
1,Uh... Did I miss something?,"Anyone else think this movie was horrible? I was falling asleep during the middle of it. Jack and Rose's romance was very unrealistic even for a holly wood movie! They just met! They can't be in love! To the fact that many parts were out of time sequence. No one who WASN'T married made out in the 1910's. If Cameron wanted to make a romance between two oversexed teens, he should have made up his own boat. I'll admit some parts were good. But most just put me to sleep. There are better films about the titanic."
1,Cheeeeesy!,"How can anyone say that this is the best movie ever made? A great movie is one that has a great story, good actors and meaning. Titanic is nothing more than a romantic splurge aimed at thirteen year old girls. The only reason it deserves one star is that DiCaprio went down with the ship, eliminating any possiblity of a sequal..."
1,This Titanic stinks on ice.,"It assaults the senses to think that a film about two fictional characters who meet aboard ship and end up having sex three days later in the back seat of John Jacob Astor's car - in 1912, no less - could become the most popular movie of our time. What a disgusting insult to history, and to the great ship Titanic.Is this supposed to be a ""tribute"" to the 1,500 people who died at sea on April 15, 1912?Cameron's film makes a mockery of the Titanic story. He turns history on its ear for the sake of a mediocre soap opera story. Maybe some screen time could have been spent paying attention to the real people who sailed aboard that ship, and not to Rose's dopey ""Freudian"" comments - which in 1912 Edwardian society would have gotten her pitched overboard.See ""A Night To Remember"" (1958), based on Walter Lord's classic bestseller, for the true account of the Titanic disaster. And sink this new ""Titanic"" into any trash-holding receptacle nearest you. END"
1,"Ridiculous price! Note: The price has dropped since then, but it's still pretty high!","Seriously, what an ridiculous price! Over $100? For either in-print version? I swear I once saw one of the DVD releases of this at Wal-Mart on the $13 rack."
2,Pitiful,"Wow, 3+ of the longest hours of my life. Got dragged into seeing it with an ""ex"" and the family. It's everything the detractors say: maudlin, syrupy, manipulative, poorly written, clich√© and contrived. We all know the damn thing is going to sink at the end. Titanic, the ship, took what--45 minutes or an hour? Titanic, the movie, took over three hours. A lot of talent wasted. Two stars for the beautiful recreation of the doomed ship's probable appearance.When this film was released, I worked in the public schools. For a year had to endure 3rd grade girls singing, in all earnestness, ""My Heart Will Go On"" at cheesy school talent shows. And being played on every classroom boom box. Like gagging on a bottle of Splenda. Avoid at all costs."
3,ripped off,"I remember back in 2000 when rumours were going round that a 4 hour version of ""Titanic"" with all the deleted scenes intact was going to be released by Christmas of that year....I was so excited and it never eventuated. I only wish we were given the option to watch the full movie and the alternate ending like they did with ""Stigmata"".....We've all seen the documentaries of how the film was made so why double up?I am only getting the 2 disc version only for the fact that it has DTS sound and now that I have my movie entertainment projector I can watch it on my wall in the living room large as life and not on a small TV screen which makes viewing this film intolerable"
4,A Qualified four,"3 stars for the acting, 4 for the overall special effects, which are still amazing. But I do agree with several reviewers; they need to release a disc with better resolution and at least some extras. That's completely chintzy on Paramount's part, but something Paramount is pretty much known for with dvds.I've seen this for as low as $7.50 in stores. A decent price until something better shows up.OH... I'm sorry, but I HAVE to say something. For those reviewers who were ""surprised"" by the fact that the ship sunk... you need, IMMEDIATELY,to 1) ask someone to lock up all your TVs,players, tapes and DVDs for at least 6 months; 2) RUN to the library or bookstore; 3) grab all the modern history books you can and 4)READ THEM. Being old enough to have seen this film and not knowing the Titanic was a real ship isn't funny, amusing, or sad. It's terrifying and pathetic."
2,"REVIEW OF THE DVD, NOT THE FILM","First off, the movie is a classic, epic, love story. I give the DVD 2 stars only because the transfer is beautiful. I find it absolutely absurd that Paramount has released such a bare-bones version of this film. It was a HUGE success and there are so many documentaries, deleted scenes, music videos, storyboards, interviews, etc that SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED! If they want to release a 10th Anniversary edition in 2007 thats fine, but they should have dropped the price on this crapper YEARS ago! 25 bucks? 19 bucks? Are you kidding me? It should have dropped to 14.99 at least 2 years ago! UUGGHH!! While TERRIBLE FILMS like '8 Crazy Nights' and 'Hulk' get the 2 disc treatment, the Academy Award winning TITANIC gets 1 disc with NO special features? Whats wrong with this picture?"
5,JACK IS STILL ALIVE!!!!!!,"Everything I could say about Titanic has been said many times over. EXCEPT THIS....Jack lives on! Neither the director nor the producers ever point out, with dialog, this little hidden gem, other than to provide scenes showing our leading lady's film grand daughter's face in several shots also used to film Jack! Go ahead, put your copy of Titanic on and compare Jack's face in close ups with Rose's grand daughter's and tell me a little unspoken surprise makes you certain Rose had Jack's baby and his looks are SO obvious in his grand daughter's!!!!!! Enjoy!!!!"
3,Can someone answer me this question please?,"So this is my question. In order for me to get most, if not all, the bonus features, I have to own blu-ray? It seems as though the 2 disc DVD version doesnt have all the bonus features.I was thinking of buying the Blu-ray/DVD combo set since it says DVD but it seems that the movie will be in DVD and Blu-ray while the bonus features will be in blu-ray :("
1,Anxiously Awaiting Titanic 2,This is the most overrated movie of all time. I went back and saw it a second time in theaters just so I could stand up and applaud when Leo died.
2,A Classic Movie but Blu-Ray is a waste of money. No different than the standard release.,Titanic is a Classic movie.I however did not see a any difference from the original standard definition movie.You should be able to see a recognizable difference in the Blu-Ray version.I think that the studios are in too big of a hurry to pull more $$$$ in on previously releasedmovies without any additional effort on their part.Reselling movies that were photographed in standard definition by putting them in a Blue Box and only recreating the menus DOES NOT MAKE IT A HIGH DEFINITION MOVIE. If it was shot in standard definition with standard everyday cameras then it will forever be in standard definition. It is possible to make the colors more saturated but the definition won't change.
1,I Can't Stand this Movie!,"I definitely don't like this movie. It is way too long for a little boat ride and the only reason why this movie did any good at the box office is because it is a ""chick flick."" It was made for the sole purpose of millions of teenage girls flocking to the theatre and drool at Leonardo Dicaprio. This movie is worth it.The only cool part in the movie is when Jack,(Dicaprio) freezes to death."
5,3D Conversion Is Fantastic,Most all know that this is a great movie. But the 3D conversion is fantastic making this great movie even greater. You won't be disappointed with this purchase. The video quality is even better than previously released DVD's/Blu-Ray of this movie.
1,Boring Drivel,"Congratulations Cameron, you got away with it. I decided to view this movie because of the number of recommendations from friends reviewers etc. Has everyone gone mad?A simple tale of a boring baby-faced American lad who falls in love with a slightly overweight,boring young English girl. One has to sit through seemingly endless hours of lifeless dialogue to arrive at the actual ship sinking. Now to the scene of the ship sinking which is remarkably well filmed. This is all one would expect of the man who directed T2.Aside from the ship sinking there is really no point to this film. One has no feelings for such wooden characters and so when the ship sinks one admires the special effects etc but the people who perished?.....so what!This is a shame because the people who did perish on that tragic night so long ago surely deserve better than this juvenile rubbish to mark their passing.The one star above is for the ship sinking scene of course"
1,stunk,"Every one told me oh! go see this movie its so good. Well, I wasn't aloud to see this movie until I this year, and I was so disapointed! It was poorly written and the actors were REALLY bad! It didn't make me cry! Although I doubt I can stop any one from seeing this movie. I really don't recomend it."
5,"Big Ship, Huge Impact","Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, and Billy Zane star in this whopper of a movie. You get to see the personalities of each of them, Leo as the adventure seeking good guy, Billy as the pompous arrogant bad guy, and Kate as the uncertain but later passionate and fun loving lady. This film has realistic action sequences, an impactful storyline, and is heavy on the romance. The movie is rather long, but it is very involving and time will fly by. This is the top grossing film of all time, and has won 11 Oscars including Best Picture. A wonderful film."
4,"titanic , a love story","a wonderful movie with a wonderful love story to go with the events of the loss of the great ship titanic. if you want suspense, adventure, and great special affects it has it too. its worth seeing over and over again."
2,11 OSCARS! I MUST HAVE DOUBLE VISION.,"I AM NOT GOING TO WRITE A THREE HUNDRED BOOK NOVEL ABOUT IT: GREAT SPECIAL EFFECTS, VERY POOR ACTING AND PLOT."
2,I cried and cried...,"... until I had to ask myself, why am I crying? Come on: who among us wouldn't want to see Leo turning blue like that, even if it's just in a movie.Really, I have never seen a film this manipulative before. Okay, not just manipulative, but exploitive. This thing starts out about as good as a can-o-corn docu-drama, and that's the set-up: the viewer is lulled into a false sense of cheese, and before you know it, you're having nightmares about drowning.So, you have to see it, because we all wonder what it's like to actually die, but like a box of Fugeeos, you hate yourself at the end."
2,blah...,"I did not like this movie - nothing about it appealed to me. The script was rotten, the acting wooden (especially Kate Winslet), and the storyline so overly dramatic that i spent more than half of the movie rolling my eyes. Billy Zane's character was so extremely one dimensional that he might have stepped directly from the pages of a fairy tale (enter the wicked witch of the west, stage right).The special effects were impressive, but like many other movies, it was simply not enough to keep the weak plot afloat (so to speak). I won't say it is the worst movie ever made, but i can think of much better things to do with 3 hours than watch Leo in a wet shirt. The worst thing about this movie is that it is so unstimulating. When there are so many thought provoking movies out there, it grates a bit that this one would get the oscar nod."
4,A very welcome break from reality,"It's nice to see that this film not only is the largest grossing of all time, but has spurred the most debate of all time. I won't bother to restate what has already been said. If you're one of the few that has not seen this movie, suffice it to say, it's silly, it's startling, and will succeed in entrancing all but the most close-minded of individuals."
5,"Everyone got sick of It, but it's Great!!!","The problem is that everyone got so sick of this movie that they ended up hating it. After going to the theatres for the 2nd viewing, all you could do was but fidgit and find something to munch on to pass time. TITANIC isn't really overrated, just over commericalized and over seen by the public, that's all.Maybe in a year or two I'll actually spend some time and watch this video, and I expect it to be a new and fresh experience."
3,Not Oscar material,"I saw Titanic in the theater. It was ok, but not good enough to win the Oscar for best picture. LA Confidential should have beaten it for best picture. It had a better plot and was just a better movie. I don't like DiCaprio or Winslet, and the only ones I do like from the whole cast is Paxton and Zane. This movie did not have to be as long as it did. They dragged too many scenes out and some were even unnessecary. If you havn't seen it (yeah right), rent LA Confidential instead."
3,I thought it wasn't worth watching more than 2wice,I liked Titanic(I saw it at the theater last January)but it was kinda cheesy and sorta unrealistic.Leonardo is very good-looking but if he is exposed too much then he can get very old if you know what I mean.Kate was kinda fat but the guys that I was with when I watched it said she was a babe!Titanic wasn't worth watching more than 2wice because it kind of goes into a lot of detail about the ship and sinking. I'd say 100% liked the movie I'd say 100% hated the movieThe percentage is about the same.
2,"BORING, BORING, BORING","Why are people flocking to this movie. The acting (besides Kate Winslet) was appaling. The story was ''Gone with the Wind"" on a boat and the characters mostly, were dull. The special effects are great I'll say that. But you have to wait for like 2 hours to get there. I like emotional movies but this one went overboard"
4,If you liked/loved the movie get this set,"I'm one of the few who didn't see Titanic in the theater when it came out but I liked it a lot on VHS and DVD. The Jack & Rose romance seemed a little bit unlikely but wasn't bad. I was always more interested in the ""look"" of the story and the extreme level of detail put into the movie.I always wondered why a movie that would look so good on Blu ray wasn't released in that format, and felt I ought to get a copy now that it is out. The included extras should be great."
1,"Haven't Seen It, Probably Never Will","There are two reasons I refuse to watch this movie. First: it got far too much hype. It's been my experience that recent movies of such immense popularity usually fall into the ""Incredibly Overrated"" category (Forest Gump, Braveheart, etc.). I attribute this phenomenon to the ridiculously low standards of the average schmuck. The second reason I won't watch this film: Mr. Leonardo Di Caprio. It wouldn't bother me that chicks really dig this guy if he was really worth the fuss. A young Paul Newman or even Tom Cruise are a lot more handsome than this lightweight pretty boy. I can only hope that most of us will someday wake up and realize what an atrocious actor this punk is. I liked him a lot better when he was on Growing Pains; At least then I could take pleasure in the fact that Di Caprio was constantly upstaged by another atrocious actor, Kirk Cameron."
2,Titanic movie,"Shipped quick, only problem was I got the wrong thing. That's not acceptable. I ordered the Titanic and got some Beverly Crawford CD."
3,Speech out of sync with video!?,"Just bought the 3-Disc edition. While watching Disc 1, in many scenes the speech was out of sync with the video. Anyone else notice it? The scene with the worst trouble was when Jack and Rose were walking on the promenade when she first irritatingly looked at his drawings. The speech was very noticeably early from the video. Yet other scenes were fine. Seems there were more problems at the beginning of the back-to-1912 scenes.I love the movie, by the way--one of my favorites. Just annoyed by the out of sync-ness."
2,I've seen better.,"I watched the whole thing, and I just don't see what all of the fuss is about. It was a painfully average movie."
3,Good tear jerker but rotten research mar the movie,I was impressed that Titanic seemed to be well researched: the characters looked good; the haircuts were appropriate; the body types were fitting. But lip stick and eye makeup are hardly acceptable in a movie laid in 1912. It so offended me that I couldn't give the movie or the video a fair viewing. I didn't find the movie immoral; I found it indifferently researched. Sloppyness offends me. END
5,My all time favorite movie!,I love this movie. I'm addicted to it! The love that Jack and Rose had draws me in. James Cameron is a genius to make such a great love story(movie)and find two young people to play the parts of Rose an Jack. Basically the movie is about a young girl who is stuck in a world of riches and glamour.She has dreams but is scared to do them when she meets Jack who shares the same dreams as her and saves her in every way a person can be saved.It is truly the movie of all ages!
2,PUH-LEEEEEEEEEEEZZZZZZEEEEEE,"How this movie ever managed to be touted as the ""best of 1997"" is beyond me. What is even further beyond my comprehension is why people kept going back to see it again and again. Four words to sum up this movie: Stupid plot; horrible acting. For the record, I have seen Leonardo DiCaprio give some brilliant performances in movies such as ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" but in this, he's completely dull. And Kate Winslet: WOODEN!!!! She seemed completely unable to comprehend the emotion in the dialogue: ""I-will-jump-I-swear-I-will"" or whatever the heck she said. Completely without feeling. Okay, the set was out of this world and the boat sinking was a pretty good piece of cinamatography but beyond that, this movie should have sank. I should point out that I am a big ""Titanic"" buff and have seen every movie version of this horrible nightmare that I've ever heard of. This was the absolute worst."
1,Oh Come on!,"This is so realistic. An old lady still deeply in love, with some kid she spent one night with more then 70 years ago. Does this not make sense to everyone. I mean she only had a husband and family, 'course she'd still remeber the guy. Let's see other problems? Too many horid acting for one (Leo's best sceen was when he looked like a frog sinking down down down...) The only good actor wass the cumputer generated one who bounced off the propellor. Don't waste you time."
3,IT WAS OKAY.......,"Titanic was alright but I could find better ways to spend 3 hours of my life. The special effects were good in most places and the acting was bareable. But to be completly honest, I don't think it was worth the billions of dollars it pulled in. Hell, I could make a movie like Titanic. Take a tragic event, add a love story and put Leo Dicaprio in it and BAM! Lets not forget to have the main characters hopeless as romantics that'll do anything for the sake of love not matter how illogical it may be. Honestly, how many of us would go back on a sinking ship for a person that we've only known for a couple of months? I swear I was the only girl in the theater NOT crying when Jack died! His death was practically broadcasted! Everyone else died, why shouldn't he? One good thing about this movie is that it's a great makeout film. (Why else would I have bought it?!)"
1,Why?,Why would anyone want to make such a sucky movie? I'm not even going to begin explaining why you should not watch/buy this movie. Please don't.
5,Titanic,"After winning a trip on the RMS Titanic during a dockside card game, American Jack Dawson spots the society girl Rose DeWitt Bukater who is on her way to Philadelphia to marry her rich snob fiance Cal Hockley. Rose feels helplessly trapped by her situation and makes her way to the aft deck and thinks of suicide until she is rescued by Jack. Cal is therefore obliged to invite Jack to dine at their first-class table where he suffers through the slights of his snobbish hosts. This movie is a truly impressive feat of entertainment."
1,"MISLEADING & DISAPPOINTING: SOMETHING OF A CON, AMAZON.","The video appended to the head of this page announces this release to contain over two hours of new content.This is not so.That relates to a different release.This bloody release possesses merely 'nearly an hour' of bonus features, which is rather different, wouldn't you say?Very disappointed."
2,Not what I expected,"I feel kind of bad writing this because I haven't asked for a refund or exchange, but for $15 I didn't think it was worth my time. Two major issues:1) The disk skipped multiple times in my player (not sure how since DVD is new?)2) The screen was small on my TV. I tried to adjust to make it bigger, but I believe that's how the picture was put on the DVD.Overall, the movie was ok, I got past the skipping parts, but it was not what I expected for my $15 + S&H;."
4,review,The movie is simply fantastic. It is a heart moving love story. The graphics and the special effects are employed at their best. It is recommended that the movie be watched on the bigger screen.
3,I don't see the point in this,"this wouldn't have been bad if the story wasn't so depressing, I don't really like chick flicks all too much and I think if anyone would want to watch a movie w/ Leonardo to chose The Man In the Iron Mask which was more dramatic and good. One of the characters on that movie was from End Of Days. This isn't the worst, but it definitely isn't the best."
5,the best movie ever made,i saw this in the movies with my wife back in 1997 and wow what a surprise.i bought it a long time ago on dvd and just never wrote a review about it till now.the scene where jack dies and shes afloat is the sadest scene of any movie i ever watched. this movie was right up my alley like if they made it for me. a real awesome awesome flick. 5 stars is not enough it has to be 100.i thank you all for reading this. so long
5,Five stars because I couldn't give it 6,"Ok, honestly who is left who hasn't seen this movie? These reviews are just a forum for the Titanic haters and lovers to duke it out. Well, put me in with the lovers. I saw Titanic the first day it opened and have watched it many times now. I cannot understand why people don't like this movie unless it is just because there has been a backlash to its popularity and people think it's ""hip"" to hate Titanic."
5,Best Movie!,"Leonardo DiCaprio, 26, and Kate Winslet, 25, bring ""Titanic"" to life as Jack Dawson and Rose Dewitt Bukater. DiCaprio plays Jack, a free spirited artist who does whatever he wants. Winslet plays Rose, a sophisticated rich girl who is engaged to an abusive man named Cal Hockley. Jack and Rose meet at the bow of the ship when Jack convinces her not to jump. Cal then invites Jack to join them for dinner tomorrow evening. Jack shows Rose his drawings and teaches her how to spit like a man. They go to dinner and go to a party downstairs afterwards. At some point, Rose changes her mind and goes to Jack. Their friendship suddenly turns into a very powerful love. After the ship hits an iceberg in the North Atlantic, their passionate love affair becomes a race for survival. My favorite scene is Jack and Rose standing on the bow of the ship and they kiss for the first time. This movie is a real tearjerker, as is both of the soundtracks. ""Titanic"" is a great movie!"
4,flawed but good,"It's interesting to note that almost all of the customer reviews here from England (and most from around the world, for that matter) are positive. We North Americans know the British are a lot smarter, more sophisticated than us, so let's take their word for it, it's a good film! Yes the plot and characterizations involving the main characters might come across as thin or unoriginal but for a historical flick this movie is a lot more entertaining than one of those equally long and much more slow-moving Swedish dramas! The reason most people like this film is because whatever its faults, it never ceases to be emotionally or dramatically engaging. Some of the reviews are quite mean, subjective and unfair. What most harsh critics of this movie seem to dislike about it isn't so much the film as much as the fact that it was so over-hyped."
4,A Worthy Effort!,"This is a movie that millions around the world have enjoyed time and time again. This movie is a worthy addition to the very long list of movies that have been done regarding the story of the fated ship ""Titanic"" is brought to the silver screen.The love story between the two ill fated lovers is both touching at sweet. I think that Mr. Cameron has done a very good job taking a real situation and adding a touch of Hollywood. This movie won several Academy Awards and was worthy of each one. I highly recommend ""Titanic"" if you want a good story that audiences can relate to."
2,Why not anamorphic???,"One of the most spectacular movies ever released on DVD and not anamorphic. What gives? I give the movie 4 stars overall, but probably 1 star for technical delivery."
4,"Don't see this movie for the acting, see it for the effects","I really liked Titanic the first time that I saw it in the theatre, when it was hardly such a commercial product and before everyone saw it just for Leonardo DiCapprio. The acting was okay, as the Oscars proved, but what I liked the most were the special effects. It was such a beautiful movie; I am glad it won an Oscar because it was the only movie I saw that I actually exclaimed ""wow"" at the end."
1,Movie celebrates the most overrated event in history,The Titanic movie should never have been made. Because no one should remember the Titanic. 1912 (the year the overrated ship sank) was a bored year for America. Nothing much was happening so the papers spent time covering this shipwreck. Six years later the world plummetted into the worst pandemic ever seen---Spanish Influenza.40 Million people died of influenza in that outbreak. Hollywood listen up and make a film about the SI Pandemic. Unlike the Titanic it was important.
1,WHY IS TITANIC A BOX-OFFICE HIT?,"I have never seen Titanic, and I don't believe I ever will. I've read (and heard from other people who've seen the movie) that there's sexuality and nudity in this PG-13 film. Sure, it's an educational movie, to a certain degree, but why learn about history when there's back-alley ribaldry mixed in?I watched ""Sense & Sensibility"" starring Kate Winslet, and thought she was an excellent actress. I still think she has great talent--- but why did she waste it in a movie that exposes children younger than 10 to sexuality? I'm asking you to consider the effects of buying Titanic. Sure, it may be 'only a movie,' but its influences are greater than you think."
3,It didn't seem like 3 hours...It seemed like 3 days,"I really looked forward to going to this movie. I normally love historically accurate films. The problem was the fact that the movie had to waste so much time on the love story that ended up turning the entire theater into one big pool of estrogen. The visual effects were very well done and Kate Winslett did a nice job, although the nudity seemed unnecessary and caused me to recommend that none of my students see the film. Leonardo DiCaprio made even this easy role seem difficult and was the main disappointment of the film. I watched the movie in a theater that was completely packed (obviously) and the temperature had to have risen over 100 degrees! Despite my misgivings, any film that surpasses Star Wars must be okay! END"
2,Problems with this 3-disc set????!!!!!!!!,"I have exchanged 3 copies of this and have found a pixelation error in the same place in all three copies of disc one during the film. So much for quality control. I called Paramount home video and they have informed me they have been flooded with calls concerning this title. It appears there are problems. I plan to get a new set from paramount themselves. If anyone else is having problems, do report it here and call paramount home video."
4,THAT WAS SO SAD!,"Titanic was a very sad movie. I already knew how many people died and stuff, but it really hit hard when i actually saw them die! Exspecially when the preacher is holding all the people's hands and reading from the bible. Then they all start falling. I admit, I cried, but not because of Jack. He was much better in Gilbert Grape. But I still loved the movie."
2,BOY MEETS GIRL ON A BOAT: HOW LAME!!,"Yup, that's basiclly what this movie was: boy meets girl on a boat. Way too long, very corny, and overall something to aviod. Unless you had more money than you knew what to do with, I don't see why anyone would pay 20 bucks for this overblown, truthfully lousy flick."
1,WARNING! Mexican Region 4 Edition doesn't have a DTS ES English 6.1 Audio Track!!!,"This rating is exclusively for the Mexican Region 4 Edition... Not the movie, nor the extras... Hang on with me and you'll know the reason why I give it such a low rating.I was excited to know that the 4 disc edition was only going to be available for certain markets (Including Mexico) but my dissappointment lies in the fact that the Mexican Edition does not have a DTS Audio Track. So, I guess I'll just have to buy it again through Amazon or in my next vacation trip to the U.S. I'm a rabid fan of DTS Sound, so it was sort of a let down to know of the lack of it when it is even announced on the box. Don't get fooled as I was. I'm sort of a completist, so I'll surely be getting the U.S. 3 disc edition just for the sake of having the chance of experiencing this movie with the best audio format ever available: DTS!Enrique Aguilar."
1,Home Theatre Fanatics and Fans of the Film - BEWARE,"Excited about your new widescreen or DVD player and want to experience it with your favorite film, Titanic? WAIT! This is perhaps the worst DVD I have ever purchased (and in 3 years I've purchased many). It is not anamorphic, or enhanced for your current or future 16x9 (widescreen) tv. It has no extras such as commentaries, documentaries, interviews, or deleted scenes (from a film famous for originally having an over 4 hour cut).I love the film. But this is worse than just a bad dvd, it's a .... I would venture to guess that this dvd was cut to capitalize on the original rush of fans who are mostly new to dvd and would buy anything ""Titanic"", knowing that many of these same fans will buy it again when the ""Special Edition"" or ""Anniversary Edition"" or ""Awards Edition"" which will inevitably come out a few years later, just to increase revenues.Save your money or buy a used version."
1,Titanic sinks,"If I ever have to sit through this movie again, or even worse listen to that damn theme song again, I'm gonna fill the bathtub with cold water and drown myself. Teenage piffle is all this is."
3,"great visual effects, so-so story","The film will get a 5 star plus for visual effects. However, the plot is silly and pretty far-fetched. I was expecting to shed some tears during the viewing, yet I slept right until the ship sank (then the movie began to get interesting). This movie is No Casablanca, Gone with the wind, or Citizen Kane, or Once upon a time in America. Not even close."
2,Missed opportunity,"Well, the DVD of Titanic could have been spectacular.What does the DVD have that the VHS tape doesn't have besides the obvious better sound/picture? Not much. It's not enhanced for widescreen TV's, but at least the studio can rerelease it in a couple of years. There's no commentary tracks, which could have been very interesting, and there's no special features of note in what is considered a special movie.As for the movie, it was fun to watch the first time, but was there ever any doubt that Jack would die? Not for me. I would've only bought the movie if it had lots of features - 'cause it loses ALOT going to small screen from theater."
3,"I'm sorry, but it's overrated...","Yes, yes, the special effects were neat. The story was heartbreaking. The movie portrayed well one of the most catastrophic events in human history.But still ""Titanic"" was not an overall wonderful movie. The acting was poor, (Leo shmeo. So he's cute. SO WHAT?) there were several... er... controversial scenes that could have been cut without taking anything away from the movie, and the directing of the live cast was not as good as all the critics said.This is also possibly one of the most overrated movies of all time. I'm not saying it wasn't a good movie. It was. But it's not Schindler's List or Casablanca or Citizen Kane. Of course it's sad. It was meant to be,But it just didn't make me cry as much as I was expecting."
2,The ultimate chick flick,"This is a great movie. If you can get past the poor acting, the women sobbing all around you, and if you can go 3 hours and 20 minutes without having to go to the bathroom. This movie might be worth watching solely for the effects, sound track (no, not Celine Dion's song), and the other 9 things that it won Academy awards for. Leonardo (Pretty Boy)DiCaprio turns in yet another lackluster performance as the romantic lead. It's not his fault that he can't act I suppose...I just wish he'd try harder. Still...this movie has grossed more revenue than any other in history. Why? Because they're are a lot of women in this country. This record will be short lived however, as the release of Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace looms on the horizon. James Cameron...your days are numbered!"
1,How did this move make millions? Ten year old girls...,"I would bet my soul that this movie made its millions from all of the ten year old girls with a crush on Leo. May I ask why all of the English people were portrayed and evil (the rich people as well). Best picture? Well, maybe if you move your mouth differently so it is pronounced: ""worst picture""."
2,Too Thin and Too Long,"Using one dimensional stick figures on a special effects ship, Cameron continues to tell a story about one dimensional people. A far superior product,""A Night to Remember"" (in black and white), is available at your local video shop. Much shorter, better action and is historically more accurate. It is a bit dated due to its age but is certainly more interesting than Cameron's version. END"
1,Not Worth the Hype,"I fail to see the hype generated by this film. If you want to see a story of the Titanic, see the one with Clifton Webb and Barbara Stanwyck. The visual effects may not be there, but the story is much better."
1,Very Cheesy,"I have to say that this movie is not very good. The ""romance"" between Leo and Kate is laughable. Throughout the movie I felt that the this relationship was rather odd. How old is Leo? 14? and Kate is how old? 40? The only redeeming point of this movie is when the boat sank. That was an amazing scene."
1,"Too Long, Too Cheesy, Too AWFUL","This film is all bark and no bite. I have no idea what everyone sees in this movie. I don't think that it really deserved all those Academy Awards. It was too long and drawn out, all icing and no cake. It was unrealistic and had bad acting on Leonardo DiCaprio's and Kate Winslet's part. I also found the dialog cheesy and laughable.It was exceedingly hard to sit through, let alone take seriously and as a result I'm forced to give it a 1"
2,Three cheers for the iceberg!,"Titanic was just a maudlin, over-acted, cliche. The love story in this movie was so predictable. The moments of highest emotion between Jack and Rose were a little nauseating. The acting was stilted. In the end I was cheering for the iceberg.The special effect were pretty cool, however. That couldn't make up for a lame story."
1,Titanic sinks to a new low,"This film boasts the worst screenplay ever written for a movie. Even some admirers of the film admit to the banal script as being deficient. The last bits of footage with the distressed captain and the sinking of the ship are very good, even excellent. However, most of the three hours is taken up with a very substandard love story. This is not Romeo and Juliet nor is it Rhett and Scarlett. Instead, it is Jack and Rose -- two kids running around the ship, giving others the finger, and otherwise acting silly (and very naive). The most overrated film of the 1990's, Titanic is a titanic waste of time and money. Don't even bother."
3,Special effects made this movie but not a classic,"Film students will watch this over and over, frame by frame, for its editing and special effects mastery, but for the average movie goer, this is a chick flick. Contrary to many reviews, Celine is one of my favorite singers and the song at the end I enjoyed even though it was over played. But WHY was it at the END. It should have been IN the movie. Major flaw. So many other flaws (sunset in the East?) made the film laughable in places. But the digital arts were incredible."
2,Cammeron's worst film,"I thought that film was entirely over-rated. It was by far one of or the worst film Cammeron's ever made. If you want to sea a good film based at sea by James Cammeron I reccomend his excellent sci-fi thriller: "" The Abyss """
3,"everyone knows that the ship sinks, why cry!!!","I love the performance of this entire cast, but we all know that Leonardo dies soooo get over it move on, no matter how many times you watch the results will be the same,just know in real life he lives on.The point that really bothered me was the selfish way the old Kate threw the necklace in the ocean after the guy spent three years of his life looking for it now that was mean. But it ruled!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Titanic,"This movie was okay, but did not live up to the hype that was caused by the media. I think that Leo and Kate did a pretty good job as main actor and main actress. I did not want to watch it a second time though and wished I wouldn't have wasted my money the first time. The rats running to get away from the sinking ship was a great add in and the musicians, I still remember them, that was my favorite part of the movie, they sang till the ship went down. Overall the movie wasn't really that great. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. If you like it buy it, if you haven't seen it, I suggest you rent it first."
2,I don't mean to upset anyone,"A good plot Idea, But ruined by several things, Most of all by leo, he's a pitiful actor. there was no emotion whatsoever, For a better film see contact, Titanic is a flea on that film's skin."
3,I thought that this movie was o.k.,"The first time you see this movie it really touches the heart, but when you see it again and again it gets really dull. I liked this movie but I wouldn't say it was the best of all time."
1,Ow. This movie actually caused me physical pain.,"Firstly, what if Jim Cameron had stereotyped an ethnic group the way he stereotyped the rich? Secondly, how can anyone claim this movie pays tribute to those who died on the Titanic when the main characters were not real people? Thirdly, folks, Billy Zane was wearing eyeliner. The sets, costumes, and special effects were beautiful. The writing and acting were rank."
1,Crashes and Sinks,"This has to be the most hyped movie ever. I thought the acting was wooden, the plot simplistic and totally without merit."
1,$,"Sets a terrible trend, where it's alright to spend $200 million on a movie. Had two dimensional characterization. Predictable to its core. CGI a little too obvious. Crowning Leonardo the next James Dean is insane. Goes to prove how much disposable income teenage girls have nowadays, as is shown also in popular music (i.e., backstreet boys, and hanson). Study the history of Titanic, but don't exploit it with a pithy ""love story."" Look for real Love in the real world, and not on the silver screen."
5,this is the way to do a special set for a movie,"we all know the story so lets get to the extras on these disc. we have hours of extras,missing scenes,test shots,and much more. if you love this movie then you should check this one out."
4,Good Movie-by Amalia Bekioti,"This film was enough exciting for me,but it was boring to watch it all,because it keeps enough time.I don't admire Leonardo Di Caprio,but the truth is he acts good at this film.This movie can make you cry,and cry,and cry...The adventurous scenes had nice effects,but...I closed my eyes at some other-but never mind.I liked it!!!"
5,titanic,"This movie is beautiful and moving. Highly reccommended, although I suggest you wait to purchase this movie until it comes out on special edition DVD in late 2004!"
3,THE LOVE STORY OF THE YEAR & THE BIG BOAT THAT RUINED IT.,"I think everyone has seen it. Knows what it's about. It was entirely too long. The unrelated love story should have been left out and released as ""Jack & Rose."" Then we could have watched a 2 hour movie depicting the boat and what REALLY happened on it. If you want to see a lovestory, see ""Romeo and Juliet"" or ""Titanic."" If you want to see a movie about the Titanic, watch a documentary.3 stars for awesome effects."
3,It could have been better,"I think this movie is a good one, I'd choosen another main actor, but.. well... it's done. The sinking scenes are just excellent made. I could feel the horror of the people. Just imagine all those people with children knowing they'll die very soon. The movie had good and bad points, but I think it's a good one when you put all in the balance."
2,DVD is not anamorphic!,"As the new owner of a digital widescreen, and anyone reading this review will soon have one, I have gone through all my DVD's and weeded out those which are not ""anamorphic"" or ""enhanced for 16 by 9"". Without those words, the black bars on a widescreen movie will take up 1/3 of a picture's available resolution. Once you get a widescreen TV, the only way to fill your screen with these movies is to ""zoom in"" - a great loss in resolution. Paramount really blew it with the creation of this DVD, as most all of the new crop of DVDs are anamorphic or enhanced for widescreen. It's a great story, but I just can't bring myself to watch it anymore knowing it could have looked so much better."
2,titanic,I wasn't expecting the movie to be split into two discs. I thought I was getting the movie and a separte disc with the special features. It was dissapointing when half way through the movie stopped and said change to 2nd disc. I would suggest finding the movie with it all on one disc unless you don't mind the movie being split into two segments. the movie is fantastic it's just the way it's set up in this dvd set.
3,WTF is up with the pop-up adds for the chapters?,"Great transfer, great audio, I personally don't care about ""extras"" that much however...there are extremely irritating pop-up chapter markers that pop up at the start of every chapter while viewing, and there are 65 chapters. I could possibly live with this if the pop-ups did not appear in the middle of the picture but even then, I can not fathom why someone would go to all the bother of creating a film like this and essentially destroy it with a cheap, gimmicky ""feature"" like a pop-up add for every chapter times 65 chapters. I've never seen something so dumb done on such an otherwise excellent blu-ray before. Is there a pop-up blocker for this kinda thing? Everything else is great, but be advised: there are annoying pop-ups that repeat 65 times on this blu-ray release."
3,"Totally overated, good but not that good.","Listen folks, I don't know how many of you watched the titanic more times than my cousin did and I think that she watched it like 25 times! The point is...yes it is a good movie but watch it more that TWO times and you'll be starting to 'drift' off. So enjoy it while it is still interesting because I don't think any of you will ever want to touch that tape again."
2,Greatest Movie of all time??!!,"I refused to see this movie at the theater. Mainly because everyone told me, ""you have to see it, it is so awesome!"" Nothing could be this good. Finally, When the video was released I watched it. It was a little better than I expected, but thats not saying much. I did however, enjoy the last hour of the movie. The special effects were phenomenal. But, idiotic dialogue and an uninspired performance from Dicaprio sunk this movie for me. And I have to say that the last time Dicaprio was really good was in ""Gilbert Grape."" I thought about purchasng the DVD but WHY? There are almost no extras on this disk! A Theatrical trailer? Thats all we get? Where is the directors commentary? What about deleted scenes or a behind the scenes documentary? Well, I guess a mediocre movie deserves an equally mediocre DVD."
3,Titanic - The 1997 movie,This is a masterpiece of special effects of the sinking of a passenger ship in subfreezing weather. The love story occupies a great part of the film and is mediocre and has nothing to do with the Titanic. The well know facts about the sinking are not covered in this film.
2,Fake love story doesn't cut it,"The fake love story doesn't cut it. It doesn't pay tribute to those who died. If it was based on real people, I would have like the movie better. Leonardo seems more like himself than the part of Jack. I didn't cry when he died."
5,anyone who does not like this movie is weird!!!,"This movie is a true cinematic masterpiece!! The costumes are beautiful, the sets gorgeous, and the story is VERY touching . The people who do NOT like this movie either have hearts as cold as ice burgs not be touched by the story, or are very jealous of Leo znd the hype surrounding this movie(which it desreves!!). I have a question to all you Titanic ""haters"" , if it is such a ""bad"" movie why is the most popular movie ever? And why did it get 11 Academy awards if it is so ""bad""!! And just because it is NOT Casablanca or Gone with the Wind(which are masterpieces too)it does NOT mean that it is a bad movie!! It is just different from those movies!!"
3,Much ado about nothing,"Please! Enough is enough! It's not amazing anymore what someone can do with several years and $100 million dollars. I give this 2 1/2 stars for the special effects and 1/2 star for audacity. The romance isn't that overwhelming; the acting is sub-par; and the plot (outside of an ocean liner sinking) is the stuff of a b-movie. And, please, don't tell me i don't appreciate romance. WEST SIDE STORY has more romance and more tragedy than this tripe."
4,A GREAT DRAMA ON THE HIGH SEAS!,"No one, including myself, knew that this would become the highest grossing film of all time. But the film lost something in the transfer from theater to VHS. If the film was slow at all, the video captures that real well. The first hour-and-fifty-minutes of the film fell like twice that length of time. The last hour-and-a-half are very exciting. Another backlash of the film is the Kate Winslet's nude scene. How the film got the PG-13 rating with THAT scene was beyond me. Other than this, the VHS is a truly exciting piece of mainstream entertainment. Those of you who like romance, excitement, special effects, and, of course, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, will surely love this film. It will make you laugh, cry, and cheer for the good guy. James Cameron's masterpiece. Grade: A-"
3,3D not all that impressive,"Love the movie Titanic, and enjoyed watching it again, but the 3D is not jaw dropping by any means. It does give a dimensional aspect that was not in the original but it's all going into the screen. Nothing ever comes out at you, not even one little splash of water. In Avatar, there was so much more dimension, but not here. I think the difference is that when a movie is filmed in 3D it comes alive in that format. When you take a 2D film and try and upconvert to 3D, it's never quite as spectacular."
5,Classic,This movie stands the test of time. It's very captivating and looks awesome on bluray. Great addition to my library.
2,"Movie was good, but what's up with the video?","The movie was good, but the video kept cutting out. That was a pain, amazon gave a refund with out asking. Way to go Amazon!"
4,"Great celluloid, but...","I could suspend my disbelief through much of this movie (seemingly targeted to pre-pubescent females), even believing that a centurion-plus Titanic survivor still had all her wits. HOWEVER, I was jolted out of the story by two things~~""I'm the king of the world"" (ARRRRRRRRRRRGG!) and ""I'm flying!"" (insert intense computer sunset here)."
2,this movie isn't that good,this movie isn't good. i think i respected that leonardo guy much better before he did this movie;.
3,A Correction from Mr. Entertainment Lover,On my last review I made a mistake. I accidently said both lovers die on the boat. I meant to say only Jack dies. Excuse me.
3,"Bubble gum, but you can still learn something from it.","This is a good film that was well worth the time I spent watching it.Frankly, I wasn't all that drawn into the main story. What was more compelling for me was how this movie brought the loss into perspective. It is difficult for me to get in touch with the loss of so many lives, especially when it happened so long ago.I suggest that you don't see this movie for the story itself, but to help bridge the gap between yourself and the era. It helped me understand how people had developed the arrogance that led to comments such as ""virtually unsinkable.""It's a good film."
4,"GREAT CAST, GOOD ACTING, AND BEAUTIFUL SETS!!",This film had a wonderful cast and beautiful sets. Every where on the ship was just beautiful. I think that it got a little stupid after a while but I think that the movie was very good and everyone tried their hardest.
2,James Cameron is truly not a King of the World,"I am quite disappointed this is an Oscar movie. The plot is not moving. I don't feel sad about DiCaprio's death, I don't find the story romantic, I don't find the ship wreck disastrous, I don't feel the titanic authentic (the SFX is so poor that I can't imagine the same director has made us Terminator 2). In short, I am so disappointed about this movie, as a fan of DiCaprio and Winslet."
1,Un-titanic image on wide screen,"Warning for widescreen TV owners: The single-DVD version pictured on Amazon with DiCaprio and Winslet almost kissing in the blue-gray sky above a right-3/4-profile of the Titanic (ISBN 0-7921-5743-5, number 15522 on the case's spine, ""Widescreen Collection"" on case's front) is NOT anamorphic. There is no excuse for cynically issuing a widescreen movie, especially a recent one, in the non-anamorphic format, which does not expand the image to the width of your widescreen TV."
1,sucky,bad movie there should have been a interview with kate or leo thats what i think anyway. do not buy this. it is not what you think it is.
1,WHAT A MOVIE!!!,"this movie was about two lovers that wasn't meant to be. so they died in the end and that was very sad. wasn't that familiar to the story of william shakespeare's romeo and juliet? however, i certainly think that romeo and juliet was a much better story that this one. the writting was better. i think that hollywood had a good idea to do a movie of the titanic, but they should not have gotten james cameron. they should have gotten somebody else. if you want to see a story about the titanic, do yourself a favor and see the musical. it was much better than the movie."
1,"A TERRIBLE, CHEAP MOVIE !","Titanic is one of the worst films, even worse than The Postman. The acting was terrible, especially Leonardo DiCaprio. The music was pretty good, but I am against the movie. I do not recommend this movie to anyone."
1,BAD!!!,I HATE IT I HAVE MY OWN GROUP OF FRIENDS AND WE ARE AGAINST IT. BUT THE PEOPLE THAT DO LIKE IT HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO LOVE THIS MOVIE AND WE RESPECT THAT.
1,don't buy this movie,if you buy this movie you are either wasting your movie or have absolutely no taste what-so-ever!!!
4,I love this movie but not the DVD. Read on....,"Well, this is a great movie. Adding romance to this sinking catastrophe sure adds life to this movie. ""You see people...""said Rose. YES! You really see people in this movie. The rich, the poor, kind hearted, the cruel, etc... While some of them didn't deserve their destiny, some nasty guys sure did. You need to see this movie to find out yourself.Now for the ratings on this DVD production. The picture quality earns 4 stars while the sound effect steals away 5. But these are not my main concerns when rating DVDs. Seriously, when DVD's selling price hits across the $20 bench mark, I expects the DVD to complement to the movie itself. If there were ""the makings"" or some extras bundled, it would surely deserve the asking price. Without all those, this DVD should be selling for less."
3,Titanic was good movie gone bad,"Titanic had the potential to be a really good movie. However It was turned into a teenage flick. It didn't emphasize how people actually died. How can people say that Jack and Rose were in love. They had a fling. It only appeared to be love because they were willing to sacrifice their lives for each other. Romeo and Juliet!!! So unoriginal. The only reason why I gave Titanic 3 stars is because of the music, special effects and some orginality."
1,Terribly Overated,"First, I just want to make it clear that how I feel about this movie has nothing to do with the actual events. Any sadness i felt was based upon the reality of what happened, not any genius on the part of Cameron. The romantic ""subplot"" was completely without merit, and the acting of the two leads was painful to watch. Had the movie focused on the more interesting (and I believe real person) Molly Brown well-played by Kathy Bates, the movie would have been excellent. Instead, I was forced to endure the contrived romance between two completely fake characters. Whether it was the script or the acting, I did not feel that Jack and Rose were the least bit believable. If you want tragedy, watch a documentary and if you want romance you are better off with The Wedding Singer (now that's romance)"
1,Why was this movie given best picture,"I am going to keep it brief. Yes, the effects were amazing, but the acting was weak, and the dialouge was nothing special at all. I suspected the Oscars were rigged, and now I know for sure. END"
1,"The ship might sink at the end, but the acting already sunk.","Effects, effects, effects. But not much else. How can a love story be so highly regarded when you can't care about the characters. I really didn't feel for either character, but Kate Winslet was just herendous as Rose. The was only one truly interesting character in the movie, and that was Kathy Bates playing the Unsinkable Molly Brown. END"
1,"Leonardo DiCaprio, turn blue and sink already!","This is one of the most appallingly bad big-budget Hollywood films of the decade. The film leaves no trite cliche un-used. For something worthwhile along the same (White Star) line, I suggest picking up a copy of 1958's A Night To Remember (Criterion Collection). Fact beats pedestrian fiction every time."
1,The Worst Cinematic Disaster in History,"James Cameron's 1997 Titanic movie SHOULD go down as the worst film ever made, but unfortunately cinema goers are so dazzled byspecial effects and Leo and Kate's ridiculously predictableridiculously tragic love story...that they turn a blind eyeto the most poorly written script in the history of movies.If only they'd spent as much on creating a good script withgood character development and good acting. If only we couldsink all copies of this movie in the North Atlantic. Butdespite the success of such a ""wreck"" of a movie, my heartwill go on..."
2,"Over 2,000 reviews and I have to add my small contribution...","Look, my friends.....this movie is almost as disastrous as the sinking of the Titanic itself!The acting is stilted, unnatural, and just plain amateurish, and the last half of the movie (beginning with the ship actually starting to sink) is boring, repetitious, and then even more boring and more repetitious. I found myself pleading with the DVD to end, because I felt there must be something more interesting than what I was seeing..."
4,Excellent DVD Presentation,"Fabulous DTS track -- subtle, immersive, no showing off.Excellent, award-worthy packaging -- the outer case has a full leatherette feel, the hubs seat the discs snugly with smooth, rounded edges.Don't miss the Crew Video in Disc 3's Special Features. Looking for a gag reel? This is it. Laughed out loud countless times. ""Y'know what I mean?"""
4,Titanic,"The used dvd of Titanic was fine. I paid too much $ for a used one, especially since this DEC. Titanic has come out with a new version for only $18ish !"
5,One Of My Favorite Movies Of All Time!!!,"I loved this movie, I saw it 6 times in the theatre. It's in my top three, along with Braveheart and The Shawshank Redemption. I don't get what's up with the idiots that hated this movie."
4,RayRay,"Titanic is a great movie. The 3D format you can not view unless you have a blueray 3D player and a 3D tv. I have other 3D movies, but you can view them on a hi def tv you don't have to have a special 3D blueray player and tv. I got this movie because we seen it in 3D at the movies thought it would be cool to see it in our house in 3D. It tells you you need the special Player and Tv in very small print on the back of the cover. if it had been in bigger print on the front I would of never got it. I am happy it is on blueray, but the 3D should be able to see on a reg blueray player with 3D glasses, you should not have to have a 3D player and 3D TV. Yes I have some of the old type 3D movies, but I don't have the blue and red 3D glasses I have some high tec 3D glasses that are like real glasses that a friend gave me that work."
3,",s,,"",,Z,,",I watched the movie Titanic.The movie is about two people fall in love.I thought the movie is very sad movie.But this movie is very nice story.I want to see again when I fall in love too.And I will be thinking that I have to alive for my lover.
3,Titanic Special & Collectors Edition,There will be two sets of DVDs to buy. Go to www.dvdtimes.com and type in Titanic at the search box. These DVDs are coming out this November of 2005. Its either a 2-Disc special edition or 4 disc Collectors edition. But lets not forget now that in two years 2007 it will be Titanics 10th year Anniversary for the movie release. Then in 2012 will be the 100th Anniversary for the Titanic Day of History. So they might bring out more of Titanic DVD info on those two years too.
5,Perfect movie!,Just got back from watching the 3D film in theaters. IT's been my favorite film for the past 15 years! I love it & I love Titanic!!!
1,Awful,"This movie is awful. Yes, the special effects are good, but that's the end of the story. It's about two kiddies from the 1990's running about on the Titanic. Dialogue is trite. Acting is atrocious. Will be pretty much forgotten in 20 years except for the 12-year-old girls who fell in love with it and remember it for nostalgia's sake. Will be completely forgotten in 50 years."
1,I could watch this film again and again,"Yes, I watch this film religiously, each time in the hope that our Leo lets Ms Winslett drop to her watery doom. Want another reason for just the 1 star? Celine Dion."
1,STUPID MOVIE!,"This movie missed the whole point and I think the reason it was popular was because of Leonardo DiCaprio for the girls and the female nudity for the guys. so of course this movie, with it's ""cute"" actor and naked actress, would do well. my advice to you - DON'T GET THIS MOVIE!"
1,"If I could, I would have given it a NEGATIVE number","This is what all the hype is about? Barely a plot, less on characters, even less acting, but hey, they're pretty and so is the computer animation. But hey, you gotta love Hollywood, they really know how to get their money. Something about a sucker born every minute...."
1,lame,"This movie is vastly overrated. The script is terrible, most of the acting is terrible, and some of the special effects look like a dark room with a candle in it. I can't imagine what they look like on the small screen.If you want to buy Titanic, I encourage you to reconsider. If you feel compelled to buy Titanic, you need to seek professional help."
2,It's the same story as The Wedding Singer,"Okay, I did enjoy the boat going down, and I think that some points in the movie were amazing. However, Titanic has the most standard plot imaginable, and it just happens to parallel Adam Sandler's The Wedding Singer. Down on his luck boy meets girl engaged to wealthy jerk. Boy and girl fall in love while wealthy jerk gives an attempt to ruin them forever. In the end, boy loves girl and girl loves boy. The only major difference is that the plane didn't crash at the end of The Wedding Singer and Adam Sandler lived."
2,Talk about overhyped!!,"Frankly, this Titanic did not deserve 11 oscar nominations and especially did not deserve the best picture win. L.A. Confidential was a much much better film with a real story line and much better acting. The acting in Titanic was horrible. If you want to see Leo act, see Whats Eating Gilbert Grape, when he should have won best supporting actor..."
5,EASTER EGGS ON THE 3rd DISC!!!!!!,"The 3rd disc has 3 hidden easter eggs and here is how to find them:SNL Skit: Go to Deleted Scenes and the last page with Chapter 29. Move the cursor so the picture for Chapter 29 is highlighted in an orange border. Hit the RIGHT cursor (nothing will happen) and then the DOWN cursor and the faint couple near the bottom will highlighted in a white border.MTV Skit: Go to the Marketing Menu and highlight ""Fox Special: Breaking New Ground"". Hit the RIGHT cursor (nothing will happen) and then the DOWN cursor and the newspaper in the lower right of the screen will be highlighted in a yellowish border.Titanic in 30 Seconds with Bunnies: Go to Special Features, then Still Galleries, then Production Artwork. Move the cursor RIGHT until ""View Entire Gallery"" is underlined. Hit the UP cursor TWICE until the blue arrow in the middle of the screen is highlighted.These are really great and you will be very happy to see them!! :) :) :)"
2,DiCaprio Ruined It!,"This film could have had much potential as a true masterpiece, however it was instead absorbed into sugary teeny bopper culture with the casting of Leonardo DiCaprio as the main character. This is supposed to be the best selling movie ever, but that is merely because ditzy little twelve year old girls went to see it 12 times each. It is good to see once, and only once. Rent it, don't buy it."
2,Ridicules,"This movie is an outrage!!!!!!!!! Bad lines, stupid actors and gory love sceans. If you have bad taste for movies, go see this one!!"
4,Visually stunning but...,"Visually, this movie was an absolute stunner. The effects were marvelous - the little directorial touches, such as Victor Garber adjusting the clock on the stairs as the room falls apart around him, or the captain standing on the silent bridge when the water suddenly gushes through.I had problems with the story, though. The character of Jack, though beautifully played by Leonardo DiCaprio, was not a REAL character - he was more like an angel sent down from heaven whose sole purpose it was to show Rose the way to redemption.One of the MOST affecting scenes was Jack in the water, knowing he was going to die from cardiac arrest any moment - Leonardo played it so that you could actually see the icy sea sucking the life out of him.Jack was the perfect lover - great for a fantasy. He was smart, savvy, romantic - but in real life he would have been crude and filthy and malodorous. But beautiful performances all around."
2,"Can touch you, but still not good enough to be great.","Though I don't really like romance or gentle movies, Titanic still touched me for a while. Leo didn't dress to look like a real third class passenger. He was too clean for someone who wonders around without a home. His Colgate smile and Head & Shoulders coiffure were definitely NOT turn off the century characteristics. I don't know why the girls like his pig-face American looks, he needed a bit more Irish cut and accent. The graphics were realistic and the special effects had some depth."
3,Good enough,"The film was very good up to a point but when I really thought about it, it was a film, not necessarily about the death of 1,507 people but about the love between two. I thought that the film ""Titanic"" would depict what actually happened.To be quite honest, I wish that they would leave the Titanic alone. It is now a grave yard. The film Titanic could be compared with making a film all about a particular grave yard."
4,A crying romance,It's a romantic film about two people in the wrong place at the wrong time.One of the best movies I'd seen......I even cried. The scenography and costimography are astonishing (that explains those Oscars). I deeply recommend this movie.
3,"Good movie, but glad I waited for video.","I was one of the few people in the world who did not see the movie in a theatre but on video. Being a fan of science fiction and of James Cameron, (I love the Terminator 1 & 2)I was not disappointed with the special effects. The Titanic sinking is the only thing that I mentally took away from the movie. Everything else was not ""GREAT"" as everyone calls it. The love story and acting was not enough to carry the film which, thank God, James may have figured out which is why it has some great special effects. I definitely would not recommend this movie to true movie lovers who value movies based on story, characters and the actors performances. After all, does anyone recall any of the actors winning an Oscar or for that matter, the screenplay?"
2,Shlock,Want to see sappy teenagers drown? Want to sit through hours of melodrama and then see terrible tragedies? Want to see how much a studio can spend?
2,"Great Movie, Poor DVD","As one of the greatest blockbuster hits ever to come out of Hollywood, one would expect more from the DVD. The DVD, especially from Fox DVD, is sub par. It contains no special features, and the quality is so-so. I would wait until a special edition (which almost assuredly will come) arrives on the scene. The DVD just does not do the movie the justice that it deserves; it is one more example of a DVD made without any real care or thought. Do yourself a favor and wait for another version."
2,Fabulous Film ruined by a Disastrous DVD!!!,"I absolutely LOVE this movie. However, the DVD is leaves much to be desired.I recently purchased a widescreen projector and a progressive scan DVD player. Tonight I eagerly sat to watch TITANIC on the new system. But, ALAS!! To my dismay, I realized that the DVD is NOT, I repeat: is NOT, anamorphic. The picture is not enhanced to fit WIDESCREEN displays. It appears all squashed up and elongated. I had to immediately switch it off!Folks, if you plan to watch this on a 4:3 TV screen or projector, by all means go for it. BUT, if you plan to watch on 16:9 display, simply FORGET about this DVD. Wait till they produce an anamorphic widescreen edition!"
5,Great BluRay set!,Glad i got my prepurchase in.. this Bluray collectors edition is great.. the packaging is awesome... and the extras are very nice. The quality of the bluray digital conversion is very clean... super great picture and sound!!
2,This movie is an insult to the rich!,"Here's what you need to do. Take a look at this film from the so-called ""villain's"" perspective. Cal, Rose's fiancee, has spent a huge sum of money on this girl. She has agreed to marry him. Her mother will wind up starving and broke if Rose doesn't do this. What happens? Before you can say ""Debbie does Dallas"", this girl is shacking up with a boy who is poor, and barely over twelve years old! The outrage! She couldn't keep her pants on around this guy for more than three days? Poor Cal. At least he had the good sense to kidnap a child, and pretend he was the father. What a fine example of the human spirit, triumphant in the face of adversity. END"
5,THIS FILM WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY,I am not a huge movie-goer but this tops them all!! I have never seen a movie with such good effects and sound!! The actors are amazing and the characters they play come to life! When I first saw this film the time went by!! Even now it takes my breathe away. This is film is undescribale!! Take my advise and buy this film!! You couldn't ask for a better price as wel!! END
1,Glug! Glug! Glug!,"Dealing with the dead, you should show some respect. With its anachronistic characters, this film is disrespectful to the past, in particular DeCaprio with his arrogant, brattish, vulgar personality. With good character actors all around, we are expected to care about what happens to the puppy love of DeCaprio's 2-dimensional character and the puggish Kate Winslet. This movie is an early indication of the disturbing trend that movies are increasingly aimed at kids or teenagers rather than adults."
2,why,why would anyone want to see this more than once --- what was the appeal? (and obviously was as per dollars) was so overrated and so underacted --- so little chemistry between the lead actors --- the supporting staff was the only saving grace -- could never compare to the passions of Dr. Zhivago!
1,Titanic Belly Flop,"Jack saves Rose from sinking herself. Jack teaches Rose how to spit. Rose falls in love with Jack. Celine Dion songs plays. Wealthy fianc√© tries to sink Jack. Big boat hits iceberg and sinks. Jack keeps Rose from sinking, again. Jack turns into meat-popsicle and sinks. Film is received by critics. Film sinks.The End"
5,Ah! Yes!,"Finally, a remake better than the original. The oringinal Titanic was a 1953 flick with that Clifton Web dude in it. Definitely not worth my while. But then I decided to go see this movie when it came out. I could see why it became the highest-grossing film ever to be released. The story is great, so are the special effects. I cannmot believe Leonarndo DiCaprio nor Kate Hudson won an Academy Award for their roles. Pathetic. This is the best movie to be made. Ever."
1,All the boring movies get oscars; thats sad,"If u really want a good 2 video movie, get Scarface or the Ten Commandments, whoa now ain't that goin' too low? Well Scarface is much better thn this, and if u want a good movie that won a bit of oscars, watch Glory, Forest Gump, or The Godfather. This is the biggest definition of a boring movie u can find. The only good part is when the dude fell of the ship and hit one of the propellers, dat was cool. This lacked everything that could prevent this from being borin', and it's one of the most cheeziest luv storiez ive seen in all my life. Unless u want a mr I'm-a-boring-cheezy-love-story-movie, don't even watch this garbage. It's one of the worst films I've ever seene"
2,At least the ship sinks in the end!,"Why this movie was such a blockbuster I have no idea. The script is tepid, the direction is OK at best and the performances merely adequate.But hey! It's got that neato ship that strikes an iceberg and sinks! I'm telling you, the last hour of the film makes up for the two hours of preceding boredom. If you hate all the characters in ""Titanic"" remember that almost everyone dies in the end--and you'll feel better."
2,A Sinking Ship,"All this movie is about a ship that sinks, and the love story in it. There is a third class passenger (Di Caprio) who falls in love with a first class passenger (Winslet) who really doesn't have any money at all. The mother doesn't approve of this relationship because she's higher than him, and is engaged to someone she doesn't love. In the end sinks, and he dies."
5,Titanic,"I loved this movie; however, I will tell you if you are expecting a historical and factual account of the past events you will be disappointed. If you watch this movie wanting to experience a gamant of emotions and to be entertained you will be left satisfied. This movie had so many interesting characters, plots and themes going on at the same time. I loved the period dress and etiquette. The love story between Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio and Rose (Kate Winslet) in my opinion is one of the great theatrical love stories in the history of the cinema. The movie layout was impeccable-the way they went from the present day to the past through the eyes of the old woman (Rose). The movie is a long one but it flows along and keeps your complete attention that you don't even realize the length of the movie. I highly recommend to those who have not seen. I can only imagine that it is a small population of viewers that have not already seen this wonderful movie."
3,GREAT MOVIE!!! But where are the extras?,"Let me start off by saying this, Titanic is a WONDERFUL MOVIE! It is one of those very few movies that I can watch, over and over again, and never get bored. The sinking scenes make you feel as though you are there. The chemistry between the two characters (Jack and Rose) is breath-taking. But, my question is, where on earth are the extras??? The reason I give this DVD a three, is because of the MAJOR LACK of extras. This movie was named ""The Most Popular Movie Of All Time."" Or so the back cover of the movie says. So why aren't there any deleted scenes? Where is the ""My Heart Will Go On"" music video by Celine Dion? Where is the blooper real? Can we ask for some interviews with the cast and crew? Or maybe some Behind The Scenes Footage? How about a director's commentary? The ONLY extra on this DVD, is the theatrical trailer. Not very impressive for the movie that grossed the most money at the box office in history."
3,Good but Crapy,It was good I like the 2nd movie not the 1st movie because it was boring and some times comfusing too so I like it not that much I like Jack not Rose she is sucky
5,Excellent Movie that will be around for a while,"Definite Classic. In 60 years, our grandchildren are going to be watching this, not Gone With The Wind. This is a timeless piece of genuine art. I have never expirienced such a movie. A movie that at times made you laugh, and the next minute, had you crying your eyes out. In the 3 hours I sat in that theater, I never stoped to look at my watch, or go to the bathroom once. People asked me how it was, and I told them that they had to see it. I told them that it was going to be the best movie that they had ever known. And after they saw it, they fully agreed with me."
5,Wait For DVD Release,"This great movie was on of my all time favorites, but you won't find me buying it on VHS. Why? DVD was made for a movie like this. Who wants to get up in the middle of the movie and switch tapes?...Boooo! The cinematic photography and the awesome sound of this movie need the DVD format to be appreciated in the way they were meant to be. I can't wait until the DVD release in February. My only complaint...what took so damn long? And I'm still waiting for Paramount to release Braveheart on DVD. These movie studio seem to have no intellegent priority for DVD releases."
4,"Good, but not great...","I thought TITANIC was a decent movie overall and I have to give credit to all the people who put so much energy into creating it. The movie is certainly not without its flaws though, most notably the ending when DiCaprio doesn't have the sense to find his own piece of broken ship to float on like Kate. He sure seemed to know a lot about life while he was on the ship, but OOPS, just one small oversight when you're in the FREEZING Atlantic. The high point in my opinion was the music. James Horner has always been a favorite of mine and his music made a mediocre movie much more dramatic and bearable to watch. A five star movie=BRAVEHEART, SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, SCHINDLER'S LIST, LEGENDS OF THE FALL, etc..."
5,romantic,Titanic is the most romantic movie I've ever seen.I'm sure all of the buyers of this movie will not forget this.
1,Mr Cameron...,"...as some others looking to please immature customers (mostly females pretending to be part of the human species) should have been banned from movies industry for believing that thing going by the name of di caprio (since there's nothing capital about him, its name shouldn't deserve any capital either) was an actor. And, since 40 years earlier there was ""A Night to Remember"", he should not have demonstrated that his earlier 'successes' were only flukes. Since I didn't hear Mr Cameron died of shame, I don't think he even knows the meaning of the word ""Pride"", and why should he have more 'self-respect' than 'customer/viewer-respect'???? He may have a bigger bank account than me. but there is sure no reason to brag about it (lucky that money has no smell)!!!"
1,Why In God's Name Are People Buying This?,"James Cameron, one of the coolest directors of sci-fi films such as Aliens and the Terminator films released one of biggest steamimg piles of crap in cinematic history when he dropped this turd. It's absolutely unforgivable especially when you consider that godawful song from Celine Dion that was played repeatedly on the radio. The worst thing of all is that after this Cameron only makes stupid Titanic documentary films when he could be making something actually worth seeing. Oh yeah, and how all of those stupid kids who are on boats who like to get at the end of it and say the ""king of the world"" crap like it's so clever. Freakin' stupid. Freakin' stupid movie too so spend your money elsewhere. Go get Skinny Puppy's Greater Wrong of the Right DVD. A better use of your money instead of wasting it on this cinematic turd pile."
2,3D Effects???,"Ok, we all know about the story--loved it. My review is on the 3D version and I am really disappointed. Does it make a difference that the movie wasn't originally shot for 3D? I'm no expert at the art of 3D, but my whole family felt the same way--blah. There was added depth to certain scenes, but the majority of it seemed like normal 2D to me. I even tweaked some of the 3D settings, still blah. Maybe it looked better at the theater, but this was a total waste of money."
1,dumb movie,"a shocker for an ending , over all i thought this movie was horrible !!i would rather watch GLITTER , and HULK on the same day ."
3,A Parent's Review,"I would just like to know when the industry will start to wise up and include family-friendly edited versions of their movies on their deluxe DVD sets. ""Titanic"" was a great movie I would love to share with the young people in my life, except for the historically nonsensical and gratuitous nudity and the sex scene. Delete these and the whole family can enjoy this blockbuster together. Family-friendly editing businesses are now supplying the needs of this market, much to Hollywood's chagrin. Would that Hollywood could spot a trend and supply their own high-quality edited versions of their ""PG-13""-rated films for families (as they do for airlines and network television). I would rather pay the original creators and producers for a sterling family-friendly version--but where is it?"
2,"WHERE IS THE DAMN ""DTS""","I cant believe these days making all hard work and extended version and double disk and three desk an so on and so on, how come is not DTS?/?? This is year 2000's, not 90s, damn 5.1, is dated audio. These days surround sound system is getting cheap and cheaper, most people these days have the system in their home ...This movie is soo big with great sound effect, u have to have the DTS to blast and real enjoy the movie, or movies in this kind of gender, for this important matter I am not going to buy this crap DVD!"
1,"A very, very bad movie. and yes, this movie is that stupid!!!","This movie is really bad. I never understood why this movie won 11 Oscars. The actors are very bad in this movie, especially Leonardo di Caprio and most of the scenes are unbelieveble and stupid (di Caprio with his arms extended and yelling ""I am the King of the world is ridiculous. Kate Winslet's character really sucks. How can she fall in love with such a jerk!!! It doesn't make any sense.There were much, but much better movies in 1997 The plot: The commonplace: the rich girl falls for the poor but goodhearted guy. That's it. Come on! Except( maybe) for the special effects, you don't get anything from this movie. Don't buy this piece of garbage! They can release it in any form. That's not going to change the fact that this movie SUCKS. Don't waste your money. Save your money for something better."
1,One of the worst movies,"This movie is horrible. It is a movie about puppy love and the ending was completely predictable, because I knew the boat would sink"
1,What was all the fuss about,People raved about this movie. And said they went to the movies to see it twice. I wouldn't won't too see it twice. Once was enough and the movie was BAD! I just didn't get what was all the hype about. A turkey of a movie.
4,"Great, except for Leo...","I am a big fan of Titanic...not just the movie but the ship also. After this movie, there are two types of fans..fans b/c of the history (me), and fans b/c of the movie and leo. This should not be the case, but it is. Anyway, I think Leo is a horrible actor (oh, get over it, y'all!). He's cute enough, but he sure as hell cannot act. Other than that, the movie was great. I have seen it five times. Happy viewing."
2,Mediocre,"""Titanic"" wasn't the worst movie, but most would know why it wasn't as good as expected. ""Titanic"" definately did not earn the name because of a fictional love story set on the doomed luxary liner. Two stars, one for the mandatory purposes and one for the special effects. The title should be renamed to something that sticks to the movie like ""Jack and Rose,"" or ""Love in the Atlantic."""
2,not on par with gone with the wind,Clark Gable probably turned over in his grave when people said Titanic was comparable to GWTW. Leo Dicaprio was extremely childish a role that should have been played by a more masculine man.
1,Titanic Sucks...Sorry,"""All this time searching for Titanic...but I never let it in!"" (Crying starts now)... This isn't good writing, folks, it's CRAP. The characters are bad (bordering on humorous).Why does Billy Zane's character shoot at our hero and heroine? Hello, the ship is going down doofus. And if she didn't jump back on the ship, her lover would have been able to climb up on the wood and survive...just an observation.I think it speaks volumes when you see the impressive shot of all those frozen bodies in the Atlantic and not shed a tear. I just thought, ""Cool VFX."" A movie about this disaster should have brought out true emotions, not forced ones (see the much superior ""A Night to Remember.""The love story has zero chemistry to boot. I know that this is a popular flick, but I just did not get it. Put it this way, if you are like Elaine from Seinfeld and thought ""The English Patient"" SUCKED...stay away from ""Titanic""...far, far away. Unless, of course, you want a good laugh."
1,a gobbler of epic proportions,"Spectacularly bad - indifferently acted, poorly plotted, and narratively incoherent (the film is told from Rose's point of view, yet she consistently relates events she was not privy to and cannot have been aware of). Cameron trivializes an awful tragedy, reducing it to mere background for a halfwitted (and anachronistic) love story. I can't believe I let my wife drag me to see this turkey. (To her credit, she hated it too.)"
1,"Really, really lame","We live in a strange world. Comic books are being written that are intelligent and poetic. Yet, I have a hard time trying to think of a good movie made in the last ten years. The problems with this film are almost limitless.1. It is historically inaccurate.2. It stars Leonardo DiCaprio. He is the archtypical pretty-boy actor (this position was once held by Tom Cruise). He handsome in away that makes teenage girls croon and every one else want to bash his face in with a sledgehammer. _Casablanca_ and _The African Queen_ (the two greatest love stories of film) starred Humphrey Bogart who is ugly as a mule, but unlike any leading ""man"" today, he could act with great subtlety.3. ... I could go forever."
4,I have seen this movie. I would like to give it 4 stars.,"I have seen this movie. It looks pretty good, but I cried at the end because it was so sad when the boat sank and there was only 1 surviver left and that was Rose but Jack died and all of the others died too."
1,.....zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.....................,"""Ty, it's time to get up.""""Ma,..*yawn**smack*do I hafta? Just 3 MORE HOURS!"" What in sam hill was so frickin' amazin' 'bout this pot-boiler?! It sucked to high hell!!! Amazon, if I may I'd like to give this mellowed out drama a new rating : ""YAWNER"" !!!!!!!!!!!!If you wanna see the best pictures of 1997 rent Boogie Nights and As Good As It Gets!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME!!!,"All I have to say about TITANIC is that it is too long, plus KATE WINSLET AND LEONARDO DICAPRIO are definatley miscast for thier roles which roles they play I wont say just watch and see. Also I felt that this movie didn't focus on the real people on the ship I believe if it had it would've been a lot better so all I have to say is skip TITANIC. And to JAMES CAMERON all I have to say is STAR WARS THE PHANTOM MEANACE period!!!"
1,Far too long,"This movie would have been merely bad had it been an hour shorter. As it is, at least three-too-many endings combine with a predicatable plot and wooden acting to result in a spectacularly abysmal film. There are better ways to spend three hours of your life."
5,Great entertainment and worth seeing.,"Simply great entertainment and worth having (particularly for use as part of a romantic evenings entertainment). Special effects in a couple of places could have been better, but this was adequately compensated for in other ways. If you want a lot of accuracy ... go get a documentary, if you want a lot of enjoyment, get Titanic. Hopefully you have a big TV and good sound to fully enjoy it."
5,The best movie I have ever seen!!,A wonderful and romantic look at the luxury ocean liner.I've seen this movie 20 times and each time I enjoy it more and more...Kate Winslet's performance was overlooked for an Oscar and was Leonardo DiCaprio's.A technically and emotionally superior film.
2,Special Effects Ahoy !!,"On every Friday night my family and I rent videos from the local store. That night we got 'Shine', 'Land And Freedom' and 'Titanic'. After watching the first two films it was time for Titanic. And my response.............. the real star of the film is the sound effects. The acting was average and the script was incredibly lame . How this typical film ever one an oscar is one of the greatest mysteries of our time. Also the soundtrack is annoying. I know Celine Dion has a lot of fans.....................but personally I`d rather listen to cats fight. END"
3,A Technical Marvel,"I could hold out no longer- I was able to rent this from the library for free, so I figured I might as well see what all the fuss was about. I must say the special effects in this film are outstanding, and James Cameron's direction was excellent. I enjoyed the 2nd half of the film more than the first because of the action when the ship began to sink. But Best Picture? The story and acting were mediocre. The true redeeming feature was how well the sinking of the unsinkable ship was portrayed on film. It was enjoyable to watch... but then, we also rented ""Volcano"" the same weekend and found that to be enjoyable, too (with about the same level of writing, though with actors/actresses floundering with embarrassingly bad lines). So why not ""Volcano"" for best picture instead of ""Titanic?"""
2,It seemed to be good a long time ago.,"Although I did like this film the first couple of times I saw it. Upon a few more viewings, it fades and I realized that the acting wasnt all that good and Leo is so annoying. If you want real films of epic proportions, see Lawrence of Arabia, 2001:A Space Odyssey, Schindlers List, or The Godfather, or the cream of the crop, Star Wars."
2,good special effects don't make up for poor acting and story,"Titanic was totally overrated as being a heart warming love story and tearjerking movie. The story was unoriginal, underdeveloped, and boring and the acting made it even worse. I do give this film some credit for the great special effects but it drags too muchin the middle and end of the movie. The movie was too long. THe story could have been told in less than two hours but it took them three and a quarter hours. The second time I saw it i found myself wishing for it to end. I don't recomend this film to anyone interested in seeing a good movie."
3,Overrated,"This film is seriously overrated. although the special effectts and scenery are stunning, dicaprios performance is mediocore at best, while winslet was actually pretty good. This film would not have been as near as popular as it was if leo wasn't in it.the only reason it is so popular is because all the 14 year old girls went out and saw it 5 times. For a truly epic movie, see ""lawrence of arabia."""
2,"The Boat Sinks, And So Does The Movie",Cliche after cliche in this film. I gave this film an extra star because of the reasearch that went into the making of this. I did not care too much for the characters in the movie...very shallow. This is the most overrated movie of the 90s.
3,Not bad at all...,"Well, now that the hype is over, I can say some stuff and get away with it. Well, almost... The big budget and visual effects almost got me, but that's all it is - big bidget special effects. Not that the overall presentation was bad - i enjoyed the movie, but it droned on a little too long. I also agree with one of the last reviewers on this page - I think it's awful that hordes of people sob only when Jack dies, but seem to forget about the hundreds of people that died also. Kate Winslet wasn't bad. I was thinking - was there real, true love between the two? It was just attraction, I'm sorry. Jack maybe did love her but it seems that Rose wanted to make her fiance jealous and show a woman can't be told what to do."
5,It Really Is About Time!!,"I am very much looking forward to receiving the 4-disk Special Edition of the movie, which I'm ordering from Amazon.co.uk because I have a ""universal"" DVD player and want the complete set. I bought the universal player because I wanted to be able to buy DVDs released in the UK....I do have a question, though: what's this ""branching"" business mentioned by one of the customers?? Is branching going to be hard to do?? I've never heard this term before, and have not seen Lord of the Rings....Thanks for any help you can provide!!"
1,Titanic DVD Feedback,"This DVD/movie came from another country due to the Customs Sticker on it andIT DOES NOT PLAY DUE TO ""AREA LIMITATIONS"".I love the movie but very disappointing not to be able to watch it after I paid for it and waited 3 weeks to come in."
2,a great film- for adolescent girls,"Remarkably well-groomed steerage class passenger catches the eye of beautiful, haughty first class passenger aboard a doomed ocean liner. Technically excellent film drowned by soap opera script and acting, plot holes and insipid sentiment."
2,Does not deserve the hype that it has received,"When I saw this movie for the first time, I thought it was pretty good. It had an aura that made it very appealing to watch. It was one of those movies that had a numbing effect on you when you left the theater However, I saw this movie for a second time and I started to think more critically about the movie itself. I think that the special effects used in this movie are probably the best that can ever be developed to portray the Titanic in any kind of production. The acting was highly overrated and too sappy. The dialogue was horrible, just about anybody could have played Leonardo Dicaprio's part with ease. If the casting directors would have picked a much more established actor with average looks, the audience could have concentrated more on the acting and the story line itself. If this was the case, people might take this movie more seriously instead of making a machary out of it. In my opinion, rent it, don't buy it."
1,stupid stupid stupid oh yeah and did I say it was stupid,"Possibly the worst movie I have ever seen I totally agree with the majority of the first reviews.I enjoy learning more about the titanic, but that had 3hr. of a love story.boring.plus they had too many of those pats if ya know what I mean. If you haven't seen it don't."
1,Yuck!,"This movie proves that the majority of our teenage society has deteriorated into ditsy bimbos that fall for cheesy plots with bad acting. Just because Leonardo DiCaprio is in it doesn't make it a good film! Personally I find him repulsive, stuck-up and a horrible actor not to mention he has the body of an 8 year old and the personality of a wet mop.I am just ashamed that I have to grow up in a generation of trendy, dense, Leo-lovin' preppys when there are so many other kinds of people in this world!!! GET OVER IT, HE IS A HORRIBLE ACTOR AND IS NOT ATTRACTIVE!!!"
1,One of the worst movies of all time...,"This movie won Best Picture if I remember correctly. What I want to know is... why??? Now, don't get me wrong, this movie has a couple of good parts, but there's a lot of immoral trash that could have (and SHOULD have) been left out of this movie. I mean, HELLO, we have almost a five minute scene showing Kate Winslet naked, lot's of swearing (not to mention flipping of elders), and add on top of that some unmarried sex!!I'm not saying this movie is all bad, it's just that it could have been a LOT better. James Cameron, I hope your next movie is a lot better!! END"
1,whats up with this dvd!,"Titanic is the highest grossing film of all time but this dvd is the worst of all time.No extras, not animorphic, paramount needs to get with the times. This dvd gets only one star for poor quality."
1,Terrible,"This was a terrible movie. My brother wrote a book on Leonardo DiCaprio (published only in England) and when researching it, he thought he should see ""Titanic."" He asked my sister about it, and she said, ""`Titanic' was so bad, I stopped the videotape before it was half done. I couldn't stand to watch it anymore."" My brother asked other people. They told him don't watch it. I told him don't watch it. So he wrote a book on Leonardo DiCaprio without seeing ""Titanic."" The book sold well, anyway. So he saved himself three hours. (As I write this, I see that there are 1060 reviews for `Titanic', the most successful movie in history. But I see at ""The Matrix"" page that it has 1789 reviews. Which tells me that ""The Martix is a much better movie. Which I agree with. See ""the Matrix"" before wasting your time on ""Titanic."")"
5,Best Movie Ever,"I mean, what can i say rather than: Titanic is the best movie ever. It might take years to release a movie as good as this one. Its DVD features are remarcable. I have the Titanic DVD movie, and let me tell you it is out of the hook. I watched the movie about 20 times and i still love it. I recommend everyone to buy this movie. James Cameron ROCKS!!"
5,So Good!,"This is a movie, that for once, actually desurves the awards it got! This movie is about the tragic sinking of the Titanic. But it is not just a boring history movie you would see in school, it has a love story in it, and some comedy. Though the actors were not that good, I was still crying at the end of it. It is a very emotional movie that will bring you back to see it again, and cry again. This movie got 11 awards, and let me tell ya: IT DERSUVERED IT!!!"
2,wow,this movie is good but should not be rated pg 13. it says every curse in the book and has a nudity and sex scene. but again overall this is a good movie
5,An addition to a classic,"First of All we all know Titanic is a masterpiece so that saves me the explaining. The 3D adds new light to this already classic, and makes an interesting watch again and again. Highly recommend this as an upgrade to your old version."
1,That Sinking Feeling,"That Sinking FeelingWhen you raise the dead from the depths of the ocean, you should show some respect. This movie insults the past with its anachronistic characters, especially DeCrapio who spits and brats his way through the movie and falls in love with that pug muffin Kate Winslet. All around good actors are dying and we're supposed to care what happens to these two amateurs. Let's try making movies for adults because the kids this is aimed at will grow up soon enough."
1,Bad Bad movie!,"This is a bad movie I do not understand why it won best picture of the year or best director,the acting was so bad as was the writing and story.If you do want to see the best picture for that year watch L.A.Confedential."
1,GIVE ME SOME TYLENOL......PLEASE!,"FIRST OF ALL, I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW THIS GARBAGE CAN BE COMPARED TO SUCH A WONDERFUL MASTERPIECE AS GONE WITH THE WIND. HELLLOOOO! PEOPLE! TITANIC IS THE MOST UNORIGINAL, UNROMANTIC, UNCONVINCING LOVE EPIC I HAVE EVER SEEN! HOW CAN THEY EVEN CALL IT AN EPIC! HOW THEY CHOSE THIS TO BE THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME IS BEYOND ME. I THINK BOTH PEOPLE AND CRITICS SHOULD TAKE SOME TIME TO SEE A REAL CLASSIC SUCH AS THE MOVIE I MENTIONED BEFORE. I THANK GOD EVERYDAY I DIDN'T WASTE 7 DOLLARS TO GO AND WATCH THIS PIECE OF DUD IN THE MOVIE THEATRES.WATCHING IT AT HOME WAS A TREMENDOUS HEADACHE IN ITSELF."
3,Predictable,"Isn't it amazing how lazy the scriptwriters in so called tinsel town are these days - I had predicted less than an hour into the film that the boat was going to sink. Also, surely I'm not the only person to think the ending would have been better if Leonardo DiCaprio had come back as a zombie. Come on Hollywood, give the public what they want!"
2,Shows what a joke the Oscars are,Too bad the overall movie wasn't as good as the special effects. When the ship starts to sink it actually gets interesting (though the storyline of the herione narrowly rescuing the chained up hunk put me in mind of a show like Aliens where every second counts; oh my will they get out?). Give me a breakUp to the sinking though you have to put up with incredibly bad dialogue and a downright boring story
3,High Definition,"A 4.7 Gigabyte Digital Versatile Disc does not contain the space needed to produce a high definition picture! MOST LIKELY your television can not either...if it can, you probably do not have the supplies needed to make the most of the picture you want! Get this issue for the extra content and the new case! The transfer's difference is extremely miniscule! Next year and another thousand dollars, and another copy of this film and you'll get to see it in high definition! Save up for next year!"
1,No interest--Zero stars,"why on earth was this movie ever made, and how did it become such a megahit? The perceived average american psyche that made this movie so popular really frightens me."
1,What a horrible movie,"This was one of the worst movies I ever saw and I can't belive it won best picture. The dialogue was horrendous, the acting terrible, and the direction very basic. Even the sinking of the ship couldn't save this movie. If you think this movie is the best ever, you must not have seen The Godfather, Schindler's List, or Fargo. END"
4,A very good movie on a very tragic occasion.,"James Cameron directs a very good movie, on a situation that will be remembered until the end of time. This movie has everything, if you're into romance it has it, if you are into suspense it has it. Plus the acting in it is very good. I would definitely recommend this movie to anybody who is thinking about buying a good movie."
3,It's Ok but not Great!,"I was anxious to View this dvd, I thought I had deleted scenes, behind the scenes, etc.. but nothing of that, the film is in stereo, has very good sound, but you expect more for $ 54.00"
4,almost........,"This is what I was waiting for all these yrs. I used to take my 3 1/2 yr old every week to see it in late 97 early 98...now shes 11 and wow....we are so excited...I only wish we had the option to watch the movies with the deleted scenes inserted back into the movie ( kinda like what they did with ""pearl harbor"" ).Now dont get me wrong, I am going to enjoy see what had to be cut, but to be able to watch the film as it was filmed would have been nicer, no??I only hope that option is available......"
2,Thank God some reviewers agree,"I was worried when I was reading the reviews that they would all be in love with this film. Thanks God, some reviewers had the sense to see this film for what it was - overatted! I agree with them. I heard much about this film, being this and that. When I actually saw it, I wasn't impression. There was great visual effects and story was fair, but to compare it to the Star Wars Trilogy or Superman The Movie is an insult! The film drags on too long and is not what one expects. I do notice that it is mainly teenage girls that seem to love this film?"
3,Pretty Good. Weak at Points.,"I saw this movie when it first came out and i liked it alot. Then i got to thinking about all the people that really died and I thought that Cameron could have spent more time foccusing on the people that died. Not just the two star crossed lovers. It seems great at first. I recommend you see it. Many people liked it, but you can make your own decision."
3,Disappointing...,"Although the special effects were great, the acting and the lines really needed work. Winslet and Di Caprio were not at all convincing and the whole cheesy ""love"" story ruined a film that could have been even better if someone else, besides a man who has divorced 5 times (and counting) wrote it. However, I loved the music, the set, and the crash scenes, which were done very well and realistically."
2,a film its glory much undeserved,"Let me be straight forward: there are tons of better movies than Titanic. The music and photography are excellent. The plot and acting belong to the third tier at best. Kate's performance pales against her perfect acting in ""Jude"". Di Caprio must be one of the worst actors I ever watch."
2,Mediocre at best,"Fantastic setting and good music. However the plot is trite and acting is contrived. Kate gave superb performance in the 1996 movie ""Jude"". Her performance is dissapointing here though it's much better than the actor.The movie's success is, in my opinion, very much undeserved."
3,"A good movie, but not the best.","I am sorry if I offend anyone, but I believe titanic was a good and decent movie. I would NOT however say it's the BEST movie of all time, because we all know that this is not true.There have been FAR better movies made than titanic. Titanic was just a huge mega budget film, and without that the movie would be nothing.The acting was below average, the special effects were great. It was such a mixed movie in my opinion. The film [plot] was pratically over before it started. One minute they met, the next the ship was bloody sinking!If you think this is the greatest movie ever, then I urge you to go and rent/buy Usual Suspects and/or The Shawshank Redemption.In conclusion Titanic was a VERY basic love story/plot that just had a high budget hollywood spin put on it.Watch it, but don't shout about it!"
2,Oh no....not again,"This movie does not hold up over time. Titanic makes me wanna throw myself overboard. Nuff said.Oh, by the way, what has ""the King of the World"" done lately? Is he still making films?"
1,BORING!,This movie is soo boring. How in the hell did this movie make so much at the box office. Do people really want to pay for crappy movies like this. bottom line this is a chick flick nothing is good. And now they are re-releasing this movie with more boring stuff. This is the worst movie ever.
2,Only in a movie theater,This came to me as a gift. I watched the movie only once before and that was in a movie theater. It was magical. That is why i was so disappointed watching this at home. It did not have the magic. I wished I never watched it on my TV and remember this movie with that theater experience.
1,Defective Disks - DO NOT BUY,"I received this product on Monday and went to watch it, at least part one, last night. Put it in the player and it got past the start screen and then went supposedly to the menu and locked my player up. Only way out was to shut the player down and turn it back on to get the disk out. Tried the second disk and it worked once but never again. Tried a different 3D movie in my player to make sure my player was still working and it worked flawlessly. I also connected my player to the internet and checked for software updates for which there were none. Also, the one time the second disk did work I started the movie to watch it and it had the worst ghosting I had ever seen on my system for a 3D movie.I would not recommend this product to anyone."
3,He doesn't realize!,"What he doesn't realize (Cameron) was that 1500 other people people were on that boat that had lives to. They weren't just extras on a movie screen. scientists had found prior to the movie was love letters from a young man to his love. Ironicly it was almost the same as the Titanic story here, EXCEPT IT WAS REAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Maybe not as handsome or pretty but at least they were real people! when Rose didn't flinch when she jumped into the freezing cold water to save her ""love"" from drowning, but her hair turns to ice in a salty atlantic ocean when its not supposed to, doesn't that seem to make very little sense? And in the car scene, they are being chased but they stop to do their business in the car and then continue the chase??? The movie was good in Special FX but other than that, its just another soap-opera. Email me if you agree. Hate-Mail will be rewarded with a little surprise!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,A GOOD FILM BUT NOT THE BEST EVER MADE FOR SURE!!!,"I saw TITANIC and I would have to say that even though the special effects are great the acting leaves something to be desired and here's why. I found leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet seemingly miscast in thier roles also the mushy diolouge dosen't help either as well. I admit I would have found the film much more enjoyable if the story had focused on some of the real people on the TITANIC such as MOLLY BROWN, THE ASTORS, etc. I feel that would have made the movie a whole lot better than it actually was. Don't get me wrong I'm not saying this film does'nt have great oops! I mean spectactcular effects but that seemed to me the best part of the film so in my opinion this film wasn't deserving of it's eleven oscar awards to say the least. My advice see AMISTAD instead now that's a really great picture."
3,Warning! Never mix Cameron and typewriters again! Ever,"For such an epic film in terms of budget, a-list acting and sheer length, who at Fox and Paramount let Cameron write the script? His arrogance, although not unexpected, is repellant after winning those oscars even though he didn't have the decency to give a three hour film the script it fundamentally neccessitates. I enjoyed the movie; but in terms of value, it will never be a classic."
2,What a crashing BORE of a movie,"Now honestly, take out the admittedly superb special effects and what have you left? Story - predictable. Plot twists - where? Dialogue - remarkably ordinary. Character development - none. Acting - just adequate but the actors had very little to do anyway. Movie length - too long. Sequel - let's hope not! Were it not for the SFX and possibly Mr DiCaprio's persona, this film would have sunk faster than its namesake with nought but murmours of ""There goes another Titanic movie."" Okay, I'll give it an extra point for the photography. Was there a soundtrack? It must have been pretty forgettable. Give us a break, there is so little substance to this movie it's not funny."
3,"Not that gooooooooood, Not that Baaaaaaaaaad","Well, i didn't cry when Leo died, although i consider my self realy sensetive. I guess he deserved it."
1,"The Absolute, No Questions Asked All Time Worst Movie Ever","I can't believe that this is the most popular movie of all time... The fact that this movie won eleven Oscars is the real American tragedy. ...This movie is right down there with The Matrix and Gone With The Wind. Leonardo di Caprio is the ""star"", Kate Winslet is the ""body"", and James Cameron is the ""mastermind"" behind this whole debacle. This is another example of cheap Hollywood commercialism. How many times are movies going to exploit great tragedies...? The only good part about this movie is that Leo dies. But even that's a jip because his death isn't nearly as painful as three and a half hours of this movie. If there's one movie that I'd destroy forever, this is it."
1,Biggest theatrical disappointment of my life!,"I was fascinated by the story of the Titanic when I was growing up and must admit that this version of the story was a total failure in my eyes. Forget that it made $600 million; that just goes to show how aimless people are with their money. I felt the movie ignored too many of the historical perspectives that caught my attention as a child; the movie only seemed concerned with attempting to develop the worst love story of all time. I can name at least 10 ""chick flicks"" that are twice as good and didn't cost a tenth to make."
2,"Nice, Not Great","""Titanic"" was a good spectacular, especially the sinking of the boat. But watching it a second time, you quickly wish the stupid love story was thrown overboard, too. It does not hold a candle to the l950 classic, ""Titanic"" starring the Barbara Stanwyck and Clifton Webb. It was in black and white, on a much smaller budget, but wow, did it deliver an emotional punch, especially Barbara's last scene when she screams: ""Norman! My little boy!"" He has stayed behind with his father, Clifton Webb. Those emotions were never touched in the teenage love affair between Kate and Leo. Dear James Cameron: you are most certainly not ""King of the World!"" You were when you made ""Terminator"", a real classic. Stop trying to see how expensive a movie you can make. Stick with sci-fi. Again, the real emotional roller-coaster movie to see regarding Titanic, is the l950 Stanwyck and Webb classic, Titanic. It's on American Movie Classics every other month."
2,A PRETTY WEAK MOVIE,I didn't think this movie was good at all.....I think it was way over-hyped when in reality it was garbage with lots of special effects to cover it up. It's basiclly boy meets girl on a boat.....how stupid!! This movie didn't deserve to make even half as much as it did at the box office.
5,Amazing!,A great epic film. A wonderful tale. Great visual effects. Deserved all 11 oscars. Kate Winslet is magnificent. Better than 'Gone with the wind'!
5,Titanic is the only movie that have moved me to tears,"A true masterpiece. I'm a big fan of James Camerons work with The Abyss - special edition being my favourite. I love Aliens, T1, T2 and even True Lies. Titanic is among camerons best. Awesome!"
4,Kept its grip on me,"First time I saw it on the screen, the images haunted me for weeks. Visually stunning, romantically breathtaking. The reduced star is from the fast-forwarding in the handcuffed-while-they-sink scenes. Eliminating that would not have detracted from this otherwise beautiful film (not to mention shortening it considerably)."
4,The Casting Director should be shot.,"This was an excellent portryal of a fictional love story that took place on an actual disaster. It had a great soundtrack and the orchestral background was strong, just like classic James Horner. I wouldn't be giving away the ending if I mentioned that the ship sunk at the end, which to me was great effects. I only disliked one part of this film, you guessed it, Leonardo Dicaprio. Somebody shoot him please. He's a terrible actor, and somebody else could have done a lot more with such a wonderful part in the film."
4,"If nothing else, get it for the music...","This movie was really good the first time I saw it, in the theatre. It was even good the second, third, fourth, and fifth times at home. And when I just recently watched it again, I stayed awake. If you've never seen it before, then you are in for a treat. Most of the world is sick of Titanic by now... Including me, for the most part- at least I'm not one of the people that goes around criticizing it a whole lot for something that isn't it's fault: People making such a big deal about it. That's why everyone is so sick of it now. But one thing that I'm not sick of, not after hearing it a hundred-plus times, is the music. James Horner is just fantastic. Without the music, this movie would not be worth seeing. With the music, it is just amazing. Of course, you could just save some money and time and get the soundtrack. But it is so amazing- the music is so wonderful. So, I'll say it again, if nothing else, get it for the music."
3,The Titatic back to life.,An impressive movie. The ship has a life of its own. A technical production by a very good director. Clever plot put to commercial effect at points. Can serve as a symbolic representation of past or future experiences for those who need it.
5,A must have for any Titanic Collector,"The only down fall I have with this DVD release is that the film is split between two DVD's. But, I imagine with all of the special extras loaded into this set it was impossible to put it on one DVD and still have a good picture.This DVD is enhanced for Widescreen TV's and looks better than the origianl release a few years ago. The extras are out of this world also. Not to mention some special footage of the actual Titanic in her resting place. Cameron goes inside of the actual Titanic and shows us rooms and things that have not been seen since she went down in 1912. Cameron is very respectful to Titanic while he is exploring her rooms and artifacts. If you have the previous DVD release, this set will blow it away."
3,What?,This movie is not for kids. I was 8 when I saw it. Do not show your kids this movie or kids don`t see it. They show a lady naked for about 15 minutes and you see everything. They even have well you know in it. It`s an okay movie though. You should see it when you`re at least 13 or 14. It`s an mature movie. They should of made it rated R. Take my advice and don`t let your kids see it.
1,BORING!!!,I'm sorry but this film didn't keep my interest. I'm even a forteen year old girl and I still didn't like it. Maybe I'm just not into romance movies. Many parts of the movie I wasn't even paying attention. The movie got tedious at times I found myself shifting in the theater seat. The only part that kept my interest was the actual ship sinking. That was done pretty good. It's amazing how many Titanic lovers critisize the people who don't like it to be in denial. What's wrong with them not liking the same movie you do? Isn't everyone entitled to their own oppinion? Why does it make you mad that their favorite movie isn't the same as yours? Sorry I've seen much better movies than Titanic. But then again maybe I'm not interest in Romance stories. What's next? Rose and Jack meet on a WWI battle feild? Rose and Jack in the Chicago fire? Rose and Jack in the Normandy Invasion? Rose and Jack meet in the Depression?
1,A FAKE.,"New specially developed special effects were used in great ammunt to make the public forget that fact that this is not but one of the silliest love histories ever told on screen ! THe director was smart enough to take a plot (the sinking of Titanic) that ever aroses interest in people (like sharks, for example, or the murder of JFK) to bring the audience into theaters. Then he filled it with special effects and no histories at all. By the way: at the end of the movie, Billy Zane's character, that at best could be defined as a rich person full of prejudice, transforms himself almos into the Devil himself! Absurd !"
2,A technically polished mediocrity,"I guess all that can be said is that Cameron botched the dialogue in every way that the dialogue can be botched. Add to that cardboard cut-outs for characters and all the cinematographic cliches that could be fit into three hours, and you get an spectacular, and spectacularly shallow, film. It's not all bad, of course. The cinematography _is_ beautiful, the acting is generally acceptable and I agree that the framing device was very well conceived. But this is a very far cry from from the work of art some have pretended it is. In all fairness there were only two of its eleven Oscars that the movie did not deserve: best picture and best director.I am much heartened to see that there are in fact quite a few people out there who were not taken in by this, judging from the comments here. Still, it did become the most popular movie of all time..."
4,Good but not great,"This movie had romance (Leo & Kate), and adventure (Titanic sinking). This movie could've been split in two -- Titanic I: The Love Story, and Titanic II: the Sinking of Titanic. And since it's popular to do trilogies... Titanic III: Kate's New Life in AmericaWell there you have my two pennies."
4,Jason B. -- Delicious!,"Just like all of you might predict I would say -- the movie itself was not that well written. One word: 'Harlequin.'Although, I did take a liking to Jason Barry's character, Tommy Ryan. All right, so his role was disgustingly flat and unrounded, but I thought the whole movie was worth watching with just a few shots of him...poor bloke! He is an extraordinary example of the male species if I ever saw one; way outshines Leonardo!On second thought, just forget Mr. DiCaprio altogether. So Tommy Ryan just yells a lot and struts with a couple of pints of Guinness, so what? Is Jack any different?"
2,Not for everyone...,"Is this comedy or drama? With the exception of a few NONROMANTIC scenes near the end (which were truly touching--the mother putting her children to sleep while the ship is sinking, the frozen corpses of the mother and her baby), I found this to be one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen. Call me an unemotional person, but it seems one has to be a romantic type to appreciate this film."
3,It was fantastic...for a day.,"Titanic. Sigh. Had SUCH potential. Over-hyped movies can get SO annoying! The first time I saw it, I loved it, except I was mildly annoyed by Leonardo DiCaprio, whose acting was not so hot and who is, yes, glamorous, however much too modern for the part. Then, when everyone started obsessing and hyperventilating over the whole thing..well, to sum it up in one popular slogan:""The ship sunk. Get over it."""
2,"Good special effects, but the dialogue...come on!",Story: good. Music: fine; Acting: tollerable. Dialogue: the worst since the dawn of time.
3,Wondering?,I'm trying to figure out why they have to put in every single detail.I mean it took an hour and a half just for the boat to sink.Leonardo is one of the worst looking guys around.He's starting to look like one of the hansons.Ewww!
3,"After 3 times seeing it, it got boring.","The first time seeing it, it was great. The second time, okay. The third time, a little borning. The fourth time it was boring. The special effets stunk and if I ever hear that Celine Dion song again I'll probelly slit my throut."
3,Unfold your deck-chair and hit PLAY,"Corny and sophomoric, ""Titanic"" has its moments, but it's best seen on the big screen. James Cameron was aiming for a single tale on which we could focus to humanize the monumental disaster of the Titanic, but with so many badly written scenes like a roster of cliches, the main story is just incidental. As far as the acting, what can one say? Di Caprio & Winslet give it their best--just what their roles deserve, I guess. Billy Zane is suitably reprehensible as the vain rich-boy villain, and the supporting cast are good, especially Victor Garber and Bernard Hill as the Titanic's engineer and captain, respectively. So just go along for the doomed ride, because it's still worth seeing just for the technical wizardry and amazing attention to detail."
1,Movie Soared; DVD Sinks Like A Stone,"A word to the wise; if you want to see the movie, rent the VHS version, you're not missing a thing. No special features! We had to see this movie saturate every aspect of pop culture and they couldn't even add a music video or making of special, special effects anything or SOMETHING to the DVD? If you like the movie, rent it. If you want cool special features, you're better off with Lord of the Rings or Star Wars."
2,Extras?,"First of all let me say I loved this movie. It is one of my favorites. So why am I giving it 2 stars? This DVD has no extras! Titanic is the biggest movie ever and there's no extras! There have been countless TV specials on this movie about the history of the ship and how they did the special effects but none of that show up on this DVD. Not even the Celine Dion music video of ""My Heart Will Go On"" which is one of the biggest songs of all time. I'm sure it'll only be a matter of time before Titanic is re-released as ""The Collectors Edition"" with everything I've been talking about but that makes me even more angry. These movie companies release a DVD and then a short time later they bring out ""The Collectors Edition"" so everybody who bought the first one got ripped off!"
5,The Best movie,"I have never been a big fan of this type of film, but after I was fourced to go I absolutly feel in love with the movie,Titanic remains to be the only movie ever to make me cry. A movie has never afftected me the way this one did, and still does. As far a accuracy, if anyone can find another film about titanic which you think is more accurate I'll be very suprised. The performances of Kate Winslet, Leo Dicaprio, and Billy Zane are fabulous, especially at such young ages. See the movie, ignore the infants trying to bash the movie."
4,Why Didn't They Have It In Full Frame To?,"Well, I have this movie on DVD. The movie was great, but they didn't have the film in Full Frame on DVD. So I had to watch it at a 2.85.1 Widescreen format. Also, there were no behind the scenes about how they made the movie Titanic. The only thing on this DVD was just the movie. I wish they would of put more interactive stuff on this DVD, or should of made a box set at lest. Disc One (Widescreen), Disc Two (Full Frame). So if you are a person who loves more than just a movie on DVD, don't count on getting it! You will only just get the movie in Widescreen format."
4,nice addition,Purchased for my dad for birthday and we all watched it. The effects are great and make the movie enjoyable to watch.
4,Very nice!,"In general, I've not been very impressed with any of the Blu-ray DVDs, however this one is exceptional. We think it's well worth it!!"
5,It's like an all-new motion picture!,Excellent movie! Well conceived and directed. The state-of-art technology that was used in this blu-ray version is astonishing.The only dissapointment came when I didn't get the digital copy of the movie because of not being a US resident...
3,"Epic for sure, Flawed completely, still a good film* * * 1/2",Titanic after years of being parody with all that stale Titanic as I still rember is still a pretty good movie even for its flaws and certainly a left turn for James Cameron who is best rembered for handling the terminator series. The obvious massive production is worth noting but the general charachter focus wasnt actually half bad. But the love story seems a bit familiar (rich girl falling in lvoe with poor boy). But if anything though it still remains a satisfying film. its big and could've been a whole lot dumber
4,630 reviews?????,"You know, even the people who claim to hate this movie are writing about it. That alone says something about the movie. If they really hated it, why are they writing? I have seen better movies in my time, and I'm only 12 years old. And yes, in case you're wondering, I'm a girl. But I'm most certainly not one of those Leo-infatuated blockheads.He's not as bad as some people say, though he could use a haircut, and a few more muscles. I admit that the reason that this movie is PG-13 rated seems a little inappropriate for a 1912 setting, but it's a love story, and how many people who are still alive were old enough in 1912 to remember what it was like then?Please don't let the bad reviews phase you. It's good, not great, but it's still a movie everyone should see. I've seen Star Wars: Episode I, and it's a lot better than Titanic. But Titanic is still good."
1,Another opportunity to get more money out of you...,"So, they finally come up with a Expanded version of a great movie. Pretty exciting stuff, but wait, there is a 4 disc version as well? Why not release that in the U.S.? Because we are suckers, that's why. We all bought the first version when it came out on DVD, we will all buy it AGAIN in this expanded version, and then we can buy it a THIRD time when they add the ""International Edition"" in time for next year's Holiday Season. Why sell something once when you can re-package and sell it again and again? George Lucas proved this theory with all the different version of ""Star Wars""."
4,well done,"This movie is not only historically accurate, but it is well done. The only flaw is that cameron should have made more of the historical part and lest out some the romance. There was too much out that romance stuff."
2,The history is better,Titanic is a good movie and has good historic parts. But the love story is way too cheesey.
1,Colossal Disappointment,"My wife and I saw TITANIC on opening night. At some point, perhaps halfway through the movie, I wanted to depart because the stupid and phony tale of the male and female leads left me dumbstruck and spoiled the otherwise appealing visuals. Unfortunately, my wife refuses to ever leave a movie that we paid to see, so, I did stay and see the entire film.A couple of years later, while I was with friends and family, I forced myself to view the entire video to see whether my initial impression was too harsh. It was not.If an edition could be sold that omitted any broadcast of or reference to the male and female leads, including the portions where the woman has aged, that version would be worth watching. When that video appears it may rate five stars. This version of TITANIC is one star; it is a colossal disappointment as story, film, and entertainment."
1,Unbearable lightness of being,"My apologies to Kundera, but this is, in a way, what he was talking. 'Titanic' is so light on substance and emotion that it is simply unbearable. Until I saw Mel Gibson's 'The Patriot', this was the worst film I had ever seen. The nauseating romance scenes, the blindingly cliche dialogue, the boring chase scenes, it's interminable length - these all add up to one of the worst movies of the century. Like a few of the other reviewers, I, too, had to summon up great strength not to burst out laughing and cheering when Leo slipped into the dark Atlantic. (I couldn't summon up enough and may have ruined it for a few people.) I imagine people like the film's love story and drama, but you get more drama from a table and chairs. 'Titanic' would have been just a laughably bad movie, except for it's promotion and production. Now it's just an unbearable waste of time."
2,Titanic Load!!!!,"The first half is standard chick-flick tripe. The second half is alright with the boat sinking, but would have been better if you didnt already know it was going to happen!!!(a fictional story, and not the story of the Titanic would have made it much better) The 2nd star is for the sinking and DiCrapio dying at the end."
5,still an excellent movie after many viewings,"for those of you who thought the movie was predictable...HELLO! Of course it was predictable... Gee Mr. Cameron, I don't think the ending will work where the ship sinks. Why dont you rewrite it so everybody lives happily ever after. Duh! Sure the love story was sappy, but if it made you remotely aware of the horrible tragedy than the movie worked. I've never heard of a bad movie winning 11 Academy Awards!"
2,.....what a let-down.....,"am i the only person who absolutely wants to scream at James Cameron for not putting out a proper DVD of this movie? i mean, he puts out a double disc DVD of ""The Abyss"" but not ""Titanic?"" i would have rather he held it back from being released on DVD than release this featureless, pointless waste of money. if i wanted JUST the movie, i'd buy the VHS...DVD isn't about the movie as much as its about the FEATURES....wake up, Jim.....get on the ball here.....i wanna hear just two words from ya: ""Special Edition""....snap to it Mr. King-Of-The-World!"
1,DVD REVIEW,"What??? This is the highest grossing movie of all time and has an extra-free DVD, only the trailer. I don't know what these studio guys are thinking, they even dare to call it ""Collector's Edition"". The image and sound are great. In my opinion this is not the greatest movie ever done, but it ain't the worst either."
1,As overrated as it was expensive,"Granted, the special effects / sets / costumes were amazing. I first saw it at Silver City Metropolis, and the movie really played up to the super-theater's oversized screen.The second time was a real disappointment -- There was absolutely no substance to back up the visuals. All I could see was poor acting and a laughable script.The movie is impressive, but ultimately forgettable. It's worth viewing once (preferably on a big screen)."
2,"Didn't mind it, but not a classic.","I wrote a review a few days ago, but forgot to add this: For all those people who continue to 'trash' Leonardo DiCapprio just remember this, he gave one of the best acting performances EVER for his role in 'What's eating Gilbert Grape'. It's just too bad he couldn't show his acting talent in Titanic. For that kind of money, he should done a far better job. A disappointment."
2,Ugh!,"I had anticipated SO much more when I went to see this movie in the theater last year. It deserved maybe two of it's eleven Acedemy Awards...certainly not Best Picture. Lousy acting, lousy story, lousy script (did it even have a script??). If all it takes to win Academy Awards these days is a hit song, some special effects and a teen heart-throb...it's truly a sad time for the entertainment industry."
4,excellent,the movie is a classic great for all ages if you havent seen titanic you are missing one of the greatest movies of all times
2,Total DVD Disappointment,"After having enjoyed this film in the theater, I couldn't wait for the home video to hit the market. After continuing to enjoy the film on VHS, I finally bought a DVD player and began to update my movie collection by purchasing DVD's of my favorites.Titanic was one I couldn't wait to have on DVD. I must say I was never so disappointed in a single DVD purchase as I was with Titanic.The single DVD contains one trailer and the movie...that's it!! No bonus material at all! But my biggest complaint was the video transfer. For a DVD, it is no better than the VHS tapes, in both video and sound quality. And if you put any zoom on it at all, it goes grainy even with a minimum amount. One would think that for the exorbant price of this DVD it would have been of top-shelf quality. Nothing could be further from the truth! This has to be the worst buy of any DVD in my collection, and I am really disgusted with it because it was one of my all-time favorite films."
3,Impressive but flawed,"This is a film that can be divided up into 2 main sections: the sunny romantic half and the watery disaster half. All my friends advised me to fastforward the first hour and enjoy the action at the end. Actually I rather enjoyed the love intrigue section (Kate Winslet is wonderful), and found myself yawning towards the end. Visually this is a fantastic film. No complaints here. At times Titanic dips close to TV movie territory with wooden acting, and high cheese content, and will therefore disappoint a lot of people who have high expectations. Another 'Gone With the Wind' this is not. I was surprised because James Cameron usually delivers the goods when it comes to a thrilling cinema experience. Still, a lot of people , mostly teenage girls, really liked it so you'll have to make your own mind up. Girls should bring kleenex and boys coffee."
5,"1/2 chick flic, 1/2 guy flic, love and disaster","I really liked this movie, or I wouldn't have bought it on DVD. It strikes me as having been built such that it would appeal to both sexes at different times, with perhaps a bit of overlap.News for those who don't know: this movie is based on the story of a (poorly designed and built) real ship which sank on its only voyage. Given that basic fact, the makers of this movie built a compelling story which I like to watch on occasion.This ""Titanic"" movie is really cool, I like almost everything about it. I just wish there was some ""making of"" on the DVD. The lack of a commentary track is pretty much expected, as commentary about a fictional story wouldn't be very useful."
4,Could Have Had More Features,"A touching movie, despite the less-than-believable love story. The DVD recaptures the images and sounds of the movie faithfully. But I would have liked to see more bonus features on the disc, such as cast interviews, deleted scenes, etc. For a movie with such incredible success, its DVD version was relatively no-frills, compared to other blockbusters. Nevertheless, this is a title worth owning."
2,This film is all about FXs,"I didn't see this movie in the theatre as I was urged to...I decided to wait until the DVD version. I'm glad I didn't spend my hard earned money on this turkey. I will say from the outset that this is a beautiful looking film, but that is as far as it goes. Perhaps if I were a 12 year old girl I might think it was great, but I am a grown woman who can't for the life of me imagine what is so wonderful about Leo! No story here. Of all the wonderful real-life stories that must have taken place on this ship, why try and fabricate one? And a bad one at that! The earlier Hollywood version of ""Titanic"" with Barbara Stanwyck & Clifton Webb, as well as the British version ""A Night To Remember"" are both far superior to this attractive trash."
4,Not The best Movie Ever Made,"""Titanic"" was all I expected, which was a somewhat interesting love story and a special effects bonanza. Leo's totally mediocre acting job is what ruined this movie. The score by James Horner and all of the other actors save this movie from totally bottoming out. James Horner, as always, delivers a masterful score. And with James Cameron directing, I was really hoping for some action, which I got. Buy this movie, if only for the second tape. The sinking is one of the greatest hours of movie I've ever seen. The best three minutes of the post sinking are Leo dying and sinking to the bottom. :-)"
2,Great for home theatre sales people,"Ok, I watched this one right after the directors cut of Das Boot, yes that is over 6 hours nautical movie mayhem. Really when you like the nazis better than doomed passengers there has to be something wrong. This one really failed the oh please! test. Really the screenplay is at fault more than anything else even medioce acters like this movie has seem embarassed delivering some the the dialog. It is a great way to show of your new dolby home theatre system if not your taste in movies. Home theatre sales people should all be issued a copy of this one. Hollywood doesnt seem to be able to make an intelligent epic anymore, not that they were ever very good at it. Greatest movie of all time, I dont think so. You want a vast beatiful and tragic epic check out Lawrence of Arabia, also a multi-oscar winning blockbuster. It really make this look rather pathetic.My big dream watching this one was to see that little das boot periscope slowly turning toward the titanic...."
2,"Drown, damn you, drown!!","How could Mr. Cameron take a subject like this and a cast and bring out the worst in everybody?The production design and cinematopraphy are sumptuous, but the script and dialogue are so banal, the fine cast delivering one empty performance after another. (Including Leo, who was so good in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"" in 1993 when I didn't yet know who he was, I thought he was really a cute little retarded kid... yet in ""Titanic"", there's just nothing there--- or nothing permitted).Talk about a SHIP wreck!!Only the two studio-backed block voting resulted in the record-tying Oscar wins/nominations."
1,Why it got some many Academy Award?,"I couldn't believe that the value of the academy became some low. I might give it a three stars rating for the sinking ship, and the four musician, two star for all other actors ( except leading actor and actress), and one star for the screenwriting and the leading casts. But since it won so many awards, I gave it overall one star."
1,BORING!!!!!,"This was one of the most boring moovies I ever saw. It was excrutiatingly long (194min. 36sec.) too long not to look away or fall asleep. What's a moovie without ""ACTION"", the main thing to a good moovie. It's virtualy impossible not to get bored or not to fall asleep while watching this moovie. If I had a choice to rate this moovie zero stars, I would. When I find people that really like this moovie I wonder how they could like one of the worlds most boring moovies."
1,Yuck,"IF KATE WANTS TO SHOW OFF HER DEFORMED BREASTS, SHE SHOULD GIVE UP ACTING AND TRY PROSTITUTION FOR A CHANGE. AT LEAST THEN TITANIC WOULD HAVE HAD A CHANCE FOR GOOD ACTING, BUT NOOOOOOO! LEO SUCKED TOO. HE'S SO MESSED UP. HE'S PROBABLY ON SOME SORT OF ILLEGAL DRUG, GIVEN HIS ACTING."
1,Worst movie of the 20th Century!,"I thought the movie was awful. Maybe because when I saw it, it was on New Year's Day 1998. (Can you say ""Hangover""? I was actually still drunk!) So, sitting in a theater with a bunch of pre-pubescent girls who cried like the day they were born didn't make it a pleasant experience. The dialogue was banal, the love story was implausible, the villian (Cal Hockley) wasn't very villianous, the old lady was just plain annoying, Leonardo DiCaprio makes me sick no matter what he plays, and people obsessed over the movie long afterwards. GET OVER IT!! THE SHIP SANK! I admit, the special effects during the ssinking were chillingly real, that doesn't make up for the rest of this monstrocity of a movie. Let there be a lesson in all of this, $200 million was spent to make this film. That's enough for a taxi ride from Earth to Uranus and back 6 times!! Was it money well spent? I think not!"
1,The stunning special FX give this film its one star.,"What happens when you mix the current teen idol, a girl with a forehead so huge you could land a B-52 bomber on it, and a plot so stupid that only a horrible director like Cameron could have written it? You get ""Titanic,"" the ridiculous blockbuster of all time. While the FX are remarkable and the costumes are lovely, the hilarious ""tragic"" death of Leo comes three hours too far away from the beginning."
1,"Summary: Poor movie, Poor acting, Poor Dialog","Anachronistic. Weak Dialog. Poor Acting. Offensive. Disgusting. Glad I didn't buy it. Wouldn't ever recommend it.Once again the industry shows us that the Oscar is worthless, hype not art!"
1,"I've seen it, now I can die","Never before in the history of the world has there been such an overhyped, overblown epic as ""Titanic"". Why did they have to center the film around a drippy love story about two people who would never be together in the first place? Leo DiCrapio was so wooden as the lead he left splinters. Why did James Cameron pick someone who looks like an anorexic twelve year old? Now this movie is sitting on my shelf and collecting dust. It will be there for a long time, I can assure you."
1,GAG ME!,"Why so many people wanted to see this movie is beyond me. DiCaprio acts like someone on drugs through the entire movie. Let me get this right, he's a porr boy who lives in England, and somehow he speaks perfect English and is remarkably clean. Get real. This movie had some good points, like the special effects and the real life scenes. But i think it says somehting about James Cameron asa guy. That boat was full of people and great stories, but he had to make his up own little corny love story. Ithas horrible dialogue and corny lines galore. Basically, I think the summary says it all. GAG ME!"
1,Sometimes I gotta wonder,"This won all those Oscars?????? Guess it's really true that the Academy rewards for ticket sales. Want a good Titanic film? Try ""A Night to Remember""."
2,3D Hassle,We like the movie and were looking forward to receiving the 3D. We would have enjoyed this so much more if we weren't constantly struggling to keep the movie going. We checked our 3D player with other movies with no problems so it's not our player. This 3D disc keeps freezing up and its quite the fight to get it going again. We had to just pass over some scenes to be able to watch the rest of the movie. So disappointing. We haven't yet looked at the remaining discs because it was such a hassle. Did we just get a bad set or are others having this same problem?
1,Its pants.,"This film, if thats what you can call it, is a pathetic glorification of the acting talents (??) of its two leads, and of the wonders a bit of money can do in Hollywood. Little girls will say ""Oh, I loved it!"", but what do they know about film? All they loved about it was the images of an over-paid star in a wet shirt. As a film studies student, I find it incredible that such a film should ever recieve 8 Oscars! Can this film really be placed in the same category as semiological and representational masterpieces such as 'On the Waterfront'? A truly great director is one that uses his films as a medium through which he communicates his ideas about people to the public. James Cameron has clearly overlooked this aspect of movie-making, and has fiocused purley on a pathetic love story followed by a sinking boat. Its crap!"
1,"I would give it no stars, but that isn't an option.","If you are going to buy the video, you are presumeably doing it for one of three reasons. For each, I have advice:(1) Reason for purchase: You missed it on the big screen. Advice: Don't bother. This is an awful film, and even worse for all of the hype.(2) Reason: Buying it as a present. Advice: Flowers or a book would be nicer. If you have to buy a *video*, try *Good Will Hunting* (dir: van Sant) or *Rainmaker* (Coppola).(3) Reason: You watched it a dozen times on the big screen and now can't wait to own it. Advice: Sorry, I cannot help you."
1,Sorry,"My eariler review of this film""tasteless piece of crap, below) was irresponsible, and inappropriate. I am a great hypocrite to call Titanic fans idiots for liking the film when I gripe about them insulting my humanity for not liking it. I hope all is forgiven. My attitude towards the film itself, however is unchanged. I saw it as nothing more than a dime store novel dressed up with special effects;Twister mounted on the scale of grand romance. some argue that the introduction of fictional, modern characters on the ship was a strong asset, allowing us to experience the tragedy by being able to identify with the characters, while others see it as a travesty. I happen to belong to the latter. END"
1,I thought that this movie was too long.,"This movie had terrible acting, dumb plot, and was way too long. I can't recommend it too any body. evn the music was bad. Also its real expensive END"
1,Unrealistic!!,"Yeah, the boat did sink. But did the writers of this movie even think about the other people who died? The husbands and lovers of more than two days? OK, so this girl meets this guy, knows she's eternally in love with him after two hours or so. Then when she dies, after a real marrage, children, and grandchildren, she returns to her one night stand. Yup. This is a movie for all the 12-14 year old girls utterly infatuated with Leo D. It's yet another movie glorifying false ideas and putting them in girls' heads, teaching them that infatuation or one night stand = love. OK, off my soap box."
2,A Great Effort... Watered-down tragic story,"This is a great effort and has good special f/x and design, although the price to make the movie could feed the world for a few centuries. The plot is, well, let's just say down-right watered-down. The movie tries to be an emotion filled drama but to me, came out only as a corny attempt to make me cry. The director is awesome, but the storyline is the only problem. The storyline is the reason why I deducted three stars. I saw this movie in theaters. While 20% of the people were crying, mostly insecure teenage girls that were just dumped. I on the other hand, feel asleep after two hours and woke up when the ship was sinking and laughed. A good use of a pool and make-up, poor use of money, a slightly worse than poor plot."
2,"Great animation, hopeless leads","I have to say I enjoyed it enough a the time, but only because it looked good. But....Kate and Leo looked like mother and son! Neither were particularly appealing or believable (or attractive). It could have been great, but it settled for mainstream, mediocre smaltz. And as for James Cameron at the Oscars.....Gimme a break! King of the world? King of an Ego more like it!"
1,Torture...,"Much has been said and written about this mega-movie. People tend to either love it or hate it. Personally, I belong to the second category. The film's special effects are generally impressive, but the plot is so utterly stupid that it makes the average soap opera look like fine art. Rarely have so many cliches been used in the same story, the characters are stereotypes and the plot turns are generally very predictable. James Cameron made some fine films in the 1980s, but in the 1990s he lost his touch, which is evident here. Still, the film won both Best Picture and Best Director Oscars (instead of LA Confidential), which once again proves that the academy tends to reward the wrong films."
2,Really Corny,"I thought this movie was extremely annoying. There was one good thing about it though, it really captured the terror of what it was probably like to be on the ship when it was sinking. It had lots of people screaming and stuff and I felt really bad for them. The worst part was when Jack, played by Leonardo Di Caprio, told Rose to close her eyes and put her arms out so she felt like she was flying. Unfourtunately, it just really didn't touch my heart. Oh well."
1,11?? are you kidding me????,"This movie sucks so bad! This is a chick-flick about 2 bad actors who have sex every 2 seconds on the Titanic. The best part is when the guy falls off the side and hit his head on the propeller! it was hilerious! How did these awful piece of crap win 11??? Saving Private Ryan deserved 11. The Shawshank Redemption deserved 11, but did they win them? NOOOOO!! Shawshank didn't even win 1!!!! and private ryan didn't even win best picture, when it is possibly THE most realistic movie, if not time period movie ever made! Titanic sucks, unless yer looking for people having sex on the Titanic."
1,"OK, now this defines bad movie","I won't even get into the plot, but essentially its a love story disaster where apparently its okay for an older chick to sleep with a teenage boy. The tragedy is completely glossed over with expensive sets and a b-movie level romance. The acting was so bad that Bill Paxton outshone everybody here with his 5 minutes. The 2nd part of the movie was just an orgy of CGI and death and had no real redeeming features.The only way it could have been worse was if it was a musical with tap dancing....then again that might have improved it."
1,The Titanic was pathetic,This movie was terrible. It does not even diserve the minimum one star that I had to rate it with. All that you honestly do while watching this movie is wait two and a half hours only to see everyone die. The cheesy love story is a flat out waste of time. The only enloyable thing that can be done with this movie is to check and see if the physics behind the people sliding around and falling off of the ship is accurate.
1,I WOULD GIVE IT A BIG FAT ZERO IF I COULD,THIS MOVIE IS THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN. IT DOSE NOT REPRESENT WHAT TRULY HAPPEND ON THE SHIP AT ALL IAM A HISTORIAN SO I KNOW DONT WASTE YOUR HARD EARN DOLLARS ON THIS RUBBISH
5,A grand and sweeping epic...,"Spectacular and exceptional historical epic involves 1912 sinking of White Star Line's prized ocean liner and two passionate individuals (both on different sides of the class system) is grand in every shape and form. Faultlessly performed by the two leads (Dicaprio is good, Winslett is better if you wish to compare them), expertly paced (with fine story telling finesse by director Cameron) and gripping from start to finish. Different, but not superior to British film ""A Night to Remember,"" is a box offic sensation...and rightfully so."
2,Academy award for best film????,Titanic's special effects are incredible. But who cares??The dialogues are pathetic and the story is terrible. As Good As It Gets should have won the Academy Award for best film!!! Thank God none of the actors in the film won an award for best actor/actress.
2,Well made mediocrity,"There's no doubting that this film will be remembered as a phenomenon. It loses a little of it's appeal on the transfer to the small screen, but it still carries more emotional weight than your average hollywood blockbuster. It could have been really awful with the poor script. It could have been really wonderful with such an ingenious idea. Instead it is simply an exceptionally well made, but run-of-the-mill story, it's well worth a watch, but don't expect to be intellectually challenged."
5,Details make this movie great,"Whatever one thinks of Leo's acting skills, or the romantic plot line ( I know it's not in fashion to like sap), a viewer would have to be blind or obtuse to miss the awesome detail work that went into this movie. The behind-the-scenes people should be congratulated for all of their hard work!"
2,only credit goes to special effects,"Best picture, best original song, all that....All right- I hated the movie. The special effects were incredible, but the rest was dumb. Reason: too predictable.Now, I don't mean, ""Oh, the ship is going to sink. It is too predictable.""What I mean is, I saw the movie and could, at every single scene, predict what was going to happen in the next three scenes. And, I was right all along! It was like every other romance movie. It doesn't deserve those awards it got. It was just another pointless movie.One other thing I hate about it: ""My Heart Will Go On."" The song was the same as every one of Celine Dion's other songs, so it should have stayed on the CD."
3,"Why Are so Many Going ""Overboard"" on ""Titanic?""","It's a well-done movie, but it is based on a rather thin, predictable story line. Accordingly, it has actors with thin talent to do the job (especially DiCaprio -- a Clark Gable or Humphrey Bogart he is definitely NOT). And the stereotypical treatment (""nasty rich"" versus ""noble poor"") of characters wore thin after only the first few lines aboard the big boat!While Cameron became obsessive with authentic set details, boy did he ever overlook all available knowledge about the effects of hypothermia! All that dramatic sloshing around in icy water, and nary a tinge of blue on any character''s skin! Amazing!Still, there's enough here to enjoy -- if you can call vicariously re-living the terror of the real Titanic victims ""entertainment."" It's a pity, all those oscars and within a few years, this will be remembered by most as that big-budget, whiz-bang special effects ""glug...glug.."" sinking ship movie."
2,Eh. enough schmultz,".... i have to say that anyone giving this movie 5 stars isBLIND to the fact that this movie is just like every hollywoodmovie. a lot of time and effort was put in this, but what about feeling? NONE. it's just eye candy for the guys, and a cheesy, unrealistic love story for the Leo girls to drool and cry over. how can anyone expect to get a film with feeling and real emotion from the guy that directed the Terminator? come on! the acting was ok, but cheesy and over done, and in some cases not done enough. sure i felt tears in my eyes, but that's just because i'm still vulnerable to Hollywood's false emotion. END"
5,One of the Finest movies Ever to hit the silver screen,"As millions of people are really quite taken by this exquisite peice of work that James Cameron wrote, alot of peole tend to forget the real sadness behind the story. Nobody could be better at that than James Cameron. The band playing until the final minutes before thew sinking, Thomas Andrews staniding in the smoking room. Evrything was so impressive. If anyone has bad things to say about this movie that is fine. But if you are a lover of history, and fine details of a story, this is a must see."
4,Interesting Model,"This will work well with my AP Pscyhology class. I wish it were more clearly labeled. However, I got a great price and it was delivered promptly."
5,Covers just about everything,"This is a very comprehensive book. We are building an addition. This book was very detailed oriened yet fairly easy to understand. It covers everything from heating and air conditioning to duct work to repairs to explaining basic terms.If you are working on an addition or building a house this would be a good book to buy.It is not a book of ideas or suggested floor plans. Rather, this book will help you build the addition or build the house once you have decided what you are doing. This a book more about the 'guts' or the 'behind the scenes' of the house building.Well worth the money."
4,Near perfect,"Man, I had to go back and listen to this underrated record recently after catching Dumptruck live @ The Hole In The Wall in Ausin TX. Great songs, good crunchy, crazy horse guitar and Seth Tiven's songs still hit hard. If you liked the late 80's classic ""For The Country"" (still out of print?!) take a listen to ""Terminal"" and the great new record ""lemmings travel to the sea"" which has a bonus live c.d."
4,Great Book on divnation,This was one of better books written by frost unfornately this book went out of print and has great infomation on diffient type of divination a great teaching book sad the frost decided not to print it anymoreIf you can find this book i would grab it for infoBlessed Be;
4,An Ealing Studios production,"Hue and Cry, an Ealing Studios production from 1947, tells the story of a group of kids in London, who stumble upon a gang of criminals using a code in a comic book serial to communicate details of their next caper. Alastair Sim, the only ""name"" person in the cast, does an excellent job in a fairly small role. I am always a bit leary of off-brand DVDs, but this disc by Wham!USA has a good print, with good audio. There are no subtitles, and no real extras. A well-done little adventure movie."
3,Accurate but lacks detail,"I read this book after reading McPherson's ""Battle Cry of Freedom"" expecting it to be on the same level. While the book is well written and researched, it lacks the actual battle detail I expected. It is almost like the actual battle itself is an afterthought. I'd recommend books by Bruce Catton for actual battlefield accounts. Amtietam is recommended as a slightly more detailed overview of America at this time in 1862."
4,Good of this type,"Actually, I would give it a 4.5, but there is no mechanism for that.This is excellent of this type, focusing on the event (Antietam) as a contingency point of history ‚Äî and fitting it into what preceded and followed this costly battle.This narrower scale lacks, necessarily, the sweep and scale of other writings by McPherson, notably, ""Battle Cry of Freedom.""Still, this treatment of Antietam is good reading with good perspective. Well worth the reader's time, and a modest expense.‚Äî Wildbill from Westchester"
3,It was ok,"I had a list of books to choose from for a class. I choose this one because the reviews made it sound very exciting. In the first chapter the author does a very good job of capturing your attention. However after that point, it reads like a boring textbook. I had a hard time enjoying myself with this book. But oh well, it was for school wasn't it?"
4,Its History,"I am reading this for my history class and with that said, I was not looking forward to reading it. However, I did find that right around Chapter 3 it picks up the pace and starts to get very interesting. I am already at the end and can't wait to hear the final outcome."
2,Shocked that is wasn't better,"This is a tired book....one that covers no new ground whatsoever. It reads like a rushed college term paper.Considering the repuation of the author, it's shocking that this book is not better.Don't waste your time. Read ""Landscape Turned Red"" if you want to study this battle."
2,Crossroads of Boredom,"The book Crossroads of Freedom would definitely be considered historical. This book was really an example of why kids do not like to read books of historical content. I will admit that the book, at some times, was interesting. I got a little bit more into it when it focused on the slave issue because I knew a little bit of background information on that, but overall the book was too complex for me. The reading was very dry, but had a lot of information. So if you wanted straight up information, this book is good for that. The book mainly consisted of quotations from newspaper articles from the time of the war, which in my mind was a good effect because it made you feel as if you were a person in that time period. All in all, Crossroads of Freedom was very dry but very informational."
2,Not as titled,"Regrettably seventy five percent of the book is not about Antietam.The book is more of a commentary on the noncourageous,insubordinate and borish General McClellan."
2,"mcpherson gets it wrong, again.","the extensively documented 'freedom' by william safire, though decades old, makes very clear that lincoln, love him as we all do, did not emancipate the blacks out of principle. he did it as a war strategy. the evidence is clear: had he wanted to emancipate the slaves as a moral principle, he would have done it for all blacks, but he limited the proclamation to the dixie states. those slaves still in the union were still slaves until after the war. and his strategy, though shrewd, was cynical. he hoped, by freeing the slaves in the rebel south, to induce those newly freed men to be a source of sabotage against dixie assets. even more cynical, he thought that rebel soldiers would fear that their women back home would be raped by the newly freed blacks and therefore desert their units."
2,This is McPherson?,"I was disappointed, frankly, by the lack of information about the battle itself; it receiving less than 20% of the approximately 150 pages. The remainder of the book felt like a mish-mash of other Civil War books where McPherson or his team threw in quotes from papers, diaries, etc. The book lacked excitement and interest and reminded me of Cliff notes. This is all too bad since I'm a McPherson fan."
2,Sorry--I'm underwhelmed,"With respect to all to the 5-star raters out there, I found this book mediocre at best. 96 pages and we still haven't even gotten to South Mountain. Only 35 pages out of 156 were actually devoted to the battles, and this includes all four: Turners Gap, Cramptons Gap, Harpers Ferry, and FINALLY Antietam. And in the handful of pages on the battle itself, nothing new or thought-provoking. I know McPherson is trying to write a different kind of military history with a broader perspective than just how many Minie Balls were shot per cubic yard, but this book was a singular disappointment."
4,Couldn't Put It Down,"This is an excellent account not only of a key battle of the war, but also of the events leading up to and following the battle. It's a quick read especially since I couldn't put it down. I have read a lot of books on the Civil War, but I still learned a lot in this one."
2,... dissertation,"What a disappointment for serious Civil War students. McPherson uses his well-deserved reputation from ""Battle Cry of Freedom"" to hawk a relatively... short work focusing on this one battle. The book is only 200 pages in length. You have 50 pages of footnotes, index, etc., 100 pages of historical context preamble and then 50 pages of well trod accounts of this battle. Antietam a crossroad? One could argue that Vicksburg and maybe Gettysburg deserve this depiction. Borrow this book from the library."
4,rated G for general audiences...,"McPherson offers a generalized look at the ""battle"", while offering many behind-the-scenes insights to the significance of this blood-marred day. The reader should be aware this is NOT a detailed account of the military campaign or any other such troop movement minutia. A ""big picture"" is developed. This is an excellent book for the casual reader or a novice in Antietam or civil war studies. A nice overview which can lead into other more detailed military accounts.This is my second read of a work by McPherson, and on both efforts I've been very impressed with his writing. As I've digested Shelby Foote's biblical efforts, I had no desire to read Battle Cry of Freedom, but McPherson display a ""comfortable"" style of writing, similiar to Foote. As I read Foote, I had the impression he was in my study ""telling me a story"". I had the same feel with McPherson. His text has a nice flow. Well done, indeed."
2,Yawn....,"This book was very disappointing. I bought ""Crossroads of Freedom - Antietam"" expecting a volume detailing the battle at Antietam. What I got was a short book rehashing the general history of the Civil War. As a matter of fact, I don't believe there are more then 20 pages in this entire book devoted to the battle at Antietam. I would not recommend this book to others."
3,a survey,"This book is an extremely bare-boned account of the battle as well as of the larger political and military events leading up to the battle. There's comparatively little about the battle of Antietam itself. I would suggest that anyone interested in the book should first check it out of the library and read it before deciding to purchase it. The book is at the level of US History 101. This is not to say that it is a bad book; the reader, however, may want to consider how comprehensive it is, or isn't, before he or she spends the money."
4,Good popular history,"Though more a highly abbreviated history of the Civil War than a history of the battle of Antietam per se, CFA is well written, well argued, and entertaining. Earlier in his career, McPherson wrote one of the finest histories ever (The Battle Cry of Freedom). CFA does not begin to match BCF for its sweep and erudition, but of course its focus (on a ""pivotal moment in American history"") is intentionally more narrow. CFA is pitched to the McCullough and Ken Burns crowd (I among them), purveyors both of excellent popular histories and excellent scholarly histories. With BCF, McPherson proved himself a master of the latter genre; with CFA, he proves himself a master of the former genre. If you're interested in Civil War history and looking for a book to begin with, CFA is as good as any. If you're seriously interested, BCF is a must."
3,Needs a different title,"After reading the book first and then reading the reviews, I have to agree that the book has it's good and bad points however I think that the title is a little misleading. I was expecting to read a book that would go into a little more detail regarding this bloody battle. I think I was past page 100 (Total story pages of 156) before Antietam was even mentioned. I did gain some insight regarding many of the social and political dramas that happened prior to the battle but when you read the title of the book, that is not what you are expecting to read about. If you are looking for a book about the battle, this is not the book to get. If you are interested in a lot of the things that were occurring, especially in England and France regarding their involvement, and whether or not they should recognize the Confederacy then perhaps this book is for you."
4,"Extremely interesting, to say the least.","To put it in a nutshell, quoting from Alexander J. Field, Haim Ofek ""argues that humans were selected for exchange, and that both the harnessing of fire, and the development of a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, were dependent on a previous selection for exchange"".In any event, I would like to add that this work reminds me of Morris Berman's ""Wandering God: A Study in Nomadic Spirituality"", in the sense, that, both books treat plenty of issues which, although instrumental to defend their respective thesis, are so interesting that, even if you do not agree with their authors, they make well worth it reading them."
4,Great book,It is a good book especially for teenagers. It is a book about a girl that likes a cute boy(anyway for her)People raed this PLEASE!! Looovveedd !Iiittt!
2,this is not poetry.,"This book is entertaining enough, but to call it poetry is very misleading. All it is is prose with line breaks.Just becauseI type a paragraphand press enterevery few wordsdoes not mean Iam writingPoetry."
4,GREAT!!! geniously written,"I loved ""What my mother doesn't no"". It is a heart-felt book about a girl who's parents fight a lot, and who has a totally ""smokin"" boyfriend. She goes through a lot with her friends, he new internet boyfriend, a mysterious masked man, and a boy names Murphey who she secretly loves. Great book, show's the struggle of teens today."
3,better than i anticipated,"I honestly expected not to like this book, finding the information on the jacket a bit drab. I have also come to dread books written as poems - too trendy! However, I really enjoyed a few of the poems Sones wrote on their own, apart from the story. What was most incredible to me was the resourcefulness and the strength Sophie showed - can't imagine going on a day vacation alone at that age! I thought it was a great departure from the Gossip Girl/Angus Thong series. The book could definitely have been improved by adding a few more poems describing, say, the week following what is the final episode in the story."
5,Sones really delves into the teenage mind!,"This is the first book I've had the pleasure of reading by Sonya Sones, and I must say, I was highly impressed. The entire novel is written in verse...and that just makes it all the more enjoyable. The book's main character, Sophie, is a wonderful teenage poet who expresses her thoughts and ideas through verse. She covers everything from boyfriends, to internet crushes, to her dysfunctional family. When I sat down and started reading this book, I literally couldn't put it down until I was finished with it! Time flies by so quickly when you're enjoying yourself, I guess. Sonya Sones is a very inspirational author, and as I teen, I can say I related to A LOT of the things that Sophie wrote about. Very inspirational, humorous book."
5,Awesome book!,"One of the best books I have EVER read!!! Just some poems, but alot of them just connected to ME! Best book for teens."
5,Loved reading this!,"As a Mom, this book was fun to read it reminded me of how I was as a teenager. I liked this book enough to share it with my 14 year old daughter.Sophie, the main character, is pretty much a good girl, but she longs for romance in a physical way as all teenager's do. It will probably be uncomfortable if not disturbing to parents, but it is reality. Her journey leads down the path that most girls do. The first boyfriend and first heartbreaking break-up. The first boyfriend that there is actual physical attraction but then it fizzles because there is nothing else there. Friends who are going through similar experiences as Sophie add to the story. Her parents are not bad, but she realizes that they are flawed people as we all are. Sophie fantasizes about more physical relationships, but she does not do more than make-out, at least not in this book. Sophie makes difficult but good decisions in the end."
4,a pretty good book,"This book is a good book for girls who like romance. It is about a girl named sophie that has a hard life at home so she looks to her friends and guys for support. Through the enetire book she has three relationships, one with a guy named Dylan that the more she gets to know him the more she dislikes him. Another with a boy she met on cyber space named Chaz. And the last one with a sweety, nerdy kid named Murphy. This book is fast paced because you always want to see what is going to happen next and who she is going date. I read this book in three days along with another book. It is not my favorite but I liked."
5,Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this was a very cool book that any teenage girl could relate to. i think it is cool because it is written as poems. It is about a girl who learns the true meaning of love and it has everything that you wouldnt want your mom knowing.
5,Through her eyes!,"The book What my Mother Dosen't Know, was a very good book. Sophie thinks everything going wrong then she falls in love with Dylan in the backseat of her friends car, then she meets Chaz after Dylan breaks up with her, at a Halloween dance. Then she meets Murphy dose she love him dose he not ...? It shows her loves, but yet dose her mother know...? I recommend the book, it shows the true meaning of love and relationships."
4,What My Mother Doesn't Know,"This book was about Sophie's first love, then her second... then her third. Her life turns up-side down when she starts to like the biggest freak in school. It starts when Sophie surprisingly ran into him in an art museum, to a simple lunch in a restaurant, and then dates almost everyday! Should she ruin her perfect life or would it not be that bad in the first place? Should she take the risk or stay on the safe side?"
3,Like reading a friend's diary,"This book was like reading my friend's diary. All she does is talk about her troubles with love life. First she says she's in dying love with one guy and thinks ""this must be what love is."" But then she meets some other guy and gets to know him and starts talking about him all the time. Then she breaks up with the guy she was first in love with and goes out with another guy and says, ""this really is what love is like,"" and it just goes on and on and on about each guy she meets. It's not only confusing in some ways but it's annoying.The book makes her sound desperate for love because her friends both have boyfriends. The book makes it sound like she falls in love with every guy she meets even if she doesn't know them. Another thing that annoyed me was that the ending was completely predictable. So in conclusion i would not recommend this book."
3,Interesting...,"This book was interesting, that's for sure. The format (all written in poems) was really cool and makes it a quick read. While the plot is not very deep and there is no characterizaton, the book was good. I enjoyed it a lot, although the ending was bad...it leaves the reader hanging. I would recommend this book to teenage girls who want a quick and cute read."
5,First time Favorite,"I never have favorite books, but I adore this one. I first saw some of Sonya Sones' writing in ""Love and Sex"" by Michael Cart, and I liked it a lot. I read 'Stop Pretending' and then 'One of those Hideous books where the mother dies' and i was hooked. Within the first few poems in 'what my mother doesn't know' i loved the book. I could relate to some of the stories SO well. It's real emotions and real issues. Not just come cliche thing that some writers associate with all teenagers. It's a great book, and i would definatley reccomend it. And all of Sonya Sones' other books."
4,good quick read,"I like this book alot. it's basically a series of poem that retell the life a normal teenage girl who goes through typical boy problems.I really like the format of the book because it was in poem form, but it still made sence and it was fun. I would recomend this book for a plane ride or a beach read. great read!!"
2,What is all the hype about?,"This book is selling like crazy and all of my friends had read it and absolutely loved it, so I decided to read it too, just to see what all the hype was about. I must say I was pretty disappointed. I read the whole book in about an hour or two, and I got nothing out of it, the whole plot is pretty lame in general. It just seemed to lack the depth and [true to teen life] perspective that other popular teen books have these days. Some people liked the poem format, but I for one found it just annoying and distracting. It took away from the plot in my opinion. In general, the book seemed like a waste of time."
4,Perfect book for any teenage girl!,"With a voice that rings true and familiar, Sophie tells her honest and humorous story of finding love and losing love. Then finding it again. She is a lovable character who is instantly recognizable by teenage girls.What My Mother Doesn't Know was a fast-paced and fluidly written story. Sonya Sones did a marvelous job writing this book and I loved the fact that it was in verse.I believe this is a book that any teenage girl could enjoy. I definitely recommend it and plan to re-read it in the future. I'm so glad that I own this book and look forward to reading more of her work in the future."
5,I loved this book,I didn't think I would like a book like this! But I loved it! It is a good book for teenage girls. It talks about what happened to her during her teen age years. She has guy problems and strange thoughts. This book made me think about what is going on in my life! Not just the drama... But other things to. threw drama and love sophie (the main character)puts her feelings together. I can't wait till the next one comes out
4,Really Great Read,"I really enjoyed this book! I am 14 years old and I have read this book more than 5 times! What My Mother Doesn't Know is good the first time, and also for when you're inbetween books, and don't really know exactly what you want to read. I would definitely recommend What My Mother Doesn't Know to anyone who ever felt like what their mind wants isn't exactly what their head wants."
2,what my mother dosent know,"I bought this book for my thirteen and a half year old granddaughter. I read the reviews on the book, and knowing she was an old thirteen, thought it appropriate. Her mother was upset, as the book is to adult, and maybe used for a sixteen year old."
2,Buy something else,"This book is one of the worst I have ever read. The plot is so incredibly dull. The only thing I like was the poetry format. Unfortunatly, that is the only thing appealing about this book. The plot consists of the main character Sophie whining about her mother and her boyfriends. Also the book was so short. It took me less than an hour to read. But thank goodness, I didn't have to endure the book anymore. But, even against my advice, if you decide to read this book, just remember that when you're finished you will probably say, ""What a fabulous waste of my life."""
1,completely inappropriate for kids!,I cannot believe that this book is recommended for girls from grade 7 up. there is so much sex in it... I wanted him to take off my clothes etc. etc. What parent would want their child to read this???? Rubbish!
5,Terrific Book!,"""What My Mother Doesn't Know"" is a terrific book, a must read for anyone who is or ever was a teenager. Sohpie, the fourteen-year-old protagonist, leads us on a touching, comic and ultimately triumphant adolescent journey, along which boyfriends are won and lost, friendships are made and betrayed, and parents with barely a clue are bravely endured. Ms. Sones writes with an honesty, immediacy and poignancy that grabs you by the heart and carries you happily and breathlessly all the way to the story's surprsising and altogether satisfying conclusion. I loved it! A Reader from Ohio"
4,What My Mother Doesnt Know Review,"Ages 11 and up. Sophie has many loves. In this book, ""What My Mother Doesnt Know,"" she talks about her life. The book tells about all her loves and how she feels about them. She's an average almost fifteen year old girl, crushing on all these boys she knows. She likes to love and to be loved. Her mind, heart and body do not seem to agree much though, when it comes to who she likes and does not like. She is not very close to her mom, but her friends help her out by writing letters to her when they leave for the summer. This book deals with friendships, teenage love, and mother-daughter relationships. This book is a good book for teenage girls to read and relate to because it deals with some of the same things teenage girls would deal with."
3,What my mother doesn't know,"This book was a little dull, in my opinion. I read the entire book in about 3 hours. Part of the reason I read it so fast was because I couldn't put it down---I wanted to see what happened next! But when I finished it, I was left with sort of an empty feeling, like ""That was a waste of a few hours.""The book was okay, but I've read better. :)"
1,I Don't See Why Everybody Loves This Book,"I read this book over a year ago, when I took it out from the public library. I had heard good reviews about it, and a lot of people said it was very good. ""It has a great plot, and it's very true to real life"", --a close friend.Well honestly, the quote you have just read from my friend is way off. This book does not have a great plot, and it is not true to real life. The 'poems' in the book are poorly written, in my opinion, I think they could have better. And really, this book is reccomended for 12 years olds? What a joke. That pisses me off.The speaker in the book writes about her sexual encounters, which I don't find appropriate for 12 years old, no matter how 'mature' they may seem. Really, what mother is going to want their preteen daughter reading this kind of book?Overall, the book was boring and the plot was bad. Don't waste your money or your time reading this book."
4,This book was okay,"This Book was okay i don't like the fact that she told her mother about the stuff that she did. Its called my mother dosen't know , so there fore her mother shouldn't have found out. You should read this book if you are interested in girl's love life"
5,The way I look at it,"The way I look at it is, my own life I mean I'm 14 and my life is almost exactly like that book. I have 2 best friends that are like sisters to me and they would do anything for me, I've dated a total geek, and my mom is in love with T.V. This book is the best book ever, I mean I couldn't even put it down when I started to read it. It's about this girl named sophi (fifi) who is going through some real hard times with boys, friends, her mom, and the internet. It was written in poem form, which I love. I think anybody over the age of 11 should read this book because it talks about more teenage things than childish things.Signed,Lacie"
5,Straight from the Heart!,"This is a wonderful book! Usually I don't enjoy that many books written in poetry format but this book was simply excellent and straight from the heart. You can sense every feeling Sophie has and most of us know exactly what she's going through. This tale of a first love, second love and third love is to be treasured!This story is about Sophie. How she is supposed to be in love with someone but...is still attracted to somebody else. She is not exactly sure what to do but her and her boyfriend aren't as close as they used to. When Sophie meets somebody knew she feels jealous, a loser, horrible. But what would people think if they knew she liked HIM?Read this book! You'll love it!"
4,My Review,"This book was greatin my eyes. It was a mix of good times and bad times in a young girl's life. Along with being able to relate to her, and all of her boyfriends and they're weird experiences they have brought her, it kept me interested the whole way through. Normally I wouldn't take the time of day to read at all, but this book kept me from putting it down. This was my favorite book of all time and I will never get sick of the plot or the amazing ending."
4,What My Mother Doesn't Know!!!,"Sophie is a boycrazy fifteen year old. Sophie tries to hide what goes on at school and what goes on at her dates from her mom, but she finds out she can't. From having to deal with Lou breaking up with her, to her feelings towards Dylan, to maybe meeting Chaz, a guy she met on the internet, to what she really feels towards Murphy, Sophie doesn't know if she'll ever survive being a teenager. Sophie thinks her friends have the perfect boyfriends, and Sophie wonders if she'll ever find Mr. Right.This book is about the life of a normal fifteen year old. It is a great book for teenage girls to read, it shows them how life plays out."
4,Through my Eyes....,"Sophie loves sexy, handsome Dylan. They meet in the backseat of Sophie's friend's sister's car. She dreams and thinks of him. He is her life. But...what's a girl to do when nothing turns out right? From Dylan and her breaking up, to sexual harassment at the school Halloween dance, nothing is going right in Sophie's life. Then there's Chaz, her Internet buddy. Trust him or not? he asks of her life in detail. ""Tell me everything about your day, start to finish, leave out nothing."" he writes. Why can't anything go right for Sophie? And also, what's with Murphy? Yeah, maybe he likes her, but she doesn't like him....does she?"
4,What My Mother Doesn't Know,"I would highly recommend this book to all young female readers. This book is so easy to relate to that it makes reading it almost like a walk down memory lane. The events are so realistic and so typical that the book is great for adults too. Being completely written in poem format, makes the reading even more interesting."
4,Text Book,"This was a text book assigned to a class in graduate school. I found it informative with how companies develop strategic plans, and how these plans may change.When writing case studies, this book provided me with much insight on how business, boardrooms, senior management, and all company employees contribute their part to operating a successful company."
4,That Old Black Magic...,"After killing a little girl in a car crash, a man named Sal (J.J. Barry) is plagued by a series of ""accidents"", and stalked by a tall, dark figure. It seems that the child's grandfather has put a curse on Sal, slowly destroying his life. Enter Kim Hunter (PLANET OF THE APES) as a mysterious mystic who could be Sal's only hope. DARK AUGUST is a sombre tale of supernatural dread, w/ a classic final confrontation between good and eeevil. Well worth a watch or two..."
1,Good movie bad video quality in this print.,The quality of this print was horrible could hardly make out the picture through most of it.
3,Not particularly happy with this bottle.,"I bought this bottle/holder for hiking, so I would have hands free to hold my dog's lease, hiking pole, or camera. The first time i hiked with it, I strapped it around my backpack belt, and it seemed ok. The next time I hiked with it, the velcro continuously became detached, making it virtually unusable for on my belt.Luckily, the one bonus point to this item, is that it also has a hook, so i clamped the hook onto one of my pack loops, and that seemed to solve the problem, but I was less happy with the bottle hanging from my shoulder than i was with it at my belt. I guess i'll have to rig something for next time I use it. Maybe if I filled the bottle with less water, the velcro would hold.I was overall disappointed with the amount of money I spent on this for the quality."
1,What were they thinking,"This is just a large bottle that you have to unscrew a cap and drink out of a 2"" diameter hole. The holder does not insulate as well. This was designed by an engineer, not a user."
1,Um ... no,"I like to carry water when I'm walking, and was looking for a solution that could carry water, keep it cold and be more flexible about being carried in a hand, on a belt, etc. I first tried using it while on my treadmill, and found that the velcro strap just doesn't hold if you've got it full of water; it loosens a little bit with every step. It's also *quite* heavy when full. I'm also very nervous about hard plastic bottles with the health concerns. On the plus side, it does offer flexibility if you can keep the darn thing on, and has little zippered pockets for keeping keys, money, gels or whatever. I decided it was just money blown, but ended up giving it to my girlfriend, who doesn't really use it for its intended purpose, but just carries it around with her when she's gardening."
1,"Buy ""The Healer"" instead","This is a very tiresome movie. The major characters are mostly caricatures, and the ruminations of the main character (played by Noah Taylor) are neither insightful nor funny. The only sympathetic character is played by Miranda Otto. I wondered why this young woman would be attracted to a self-absorbed bore like Noah Taylor. This happens only in the fantasies of the self-absorbed and boring writers of the script. Another offensive aspect of this movie is its lame satire of Christianity. Again there is no characterization of the Adventists, only caricature. And after seeing what happens to the non-religious ""drop outs,"" all I can say is: ""Give me that old time religion!"" It sure beats spending the rest of your life in a spiritual fallout shelter."
1,VERY BAD!,"As much as I hate this ersatz manufactured group of musical ""Wannabes,"" the only good thing that can be said about them is that many girls feel better about themselves.Spice Girls. Some example. They can't sing, dance, act, play any instruments, compose or deliver lines. They are just a musical farce. Detractors of the original quintet have dubbed them Nasty Spice, Rancid, Rotten, Stinky and Stupid. Old Spices belong in the cupboard or down the drain after a certain amount of time has elapsed. These women belong down the drain!"
3,weeds,"found what i wanted to identify. thank you book contains way to many choices as it is fine for a steady garden/grass id but, overwhems the novice."
2,The Innocents,"Not sure why it was release 6 years after it was made. Very beautiful scenery, not bad acting and not bad story line. Overall a good movie."
2,Misses the mark,"Very tepid & a poor presentation by a steller performer...don`t waste your money, there are better offerings available by doug kershaw"
1,Disappointed,I ordered this new because I needed the 3 CD Discs for the class --- when I received the package it came without the discs. I called and found out that they did not have any more --- they still went ahead and sent the book and they did not send a note nor did they reduce the cost. I think that is ridiculous. I now have to return the item for credit.
4,Pretty good,"I found this book very informative and interesting. It contains lots of information. I highly recommend this book. Included CDs come with wide variety of Music, which was intriguing and interesting to listen too."
5,Easy to understand,"I've read many books recently on Buddhism and meditation. I find quite a few of them hard to read; there are many says like, ""it is your breath, but it is not your breath"" that I try very much to wrap my head but never quite do. This book is much more straight forward for a western reader. I found it very easy to read and follow. It covers a lot, and I will probably have to reread chapters after I've done more zazen sitting, but it really is accessible and well written. If you are looking for a beginner's guide to Buddhist principals and teaching and want to start sitting meditation in a meaningful way, this is the book for you."
5,DIY with the right parts,"This tool was just what I needed. it performed great. To pull/install a hub/axle you need this.shipped fast and very pleased. Glad I wont have to use it alot since that means car problems (not tool problems) but when I have to use it, it will be a joy. this tool really makes the job easy. high quality for the garage DIY-erIt rocks!"
4,fun little mystery,So often I start reading kindle books I got for free and cant get past a page or two. This one enacted me and kept me hooked for a fast-paced ride. I didn't manage to figure out the who done it before she told me and I was right there with her following the clues. I'd love to spend more time in this small town with these quirky characters.
4,A Nice Read,"This book was good. I enjoyed it. But I knew who the killer was way before the end. That's why I'm only giving it 4 stars. However, the characters were funny and I like the main characters sense of humor. I will keep reading the series."
2,It is OK,"This is an OK read, but I did not find it so great. I am not a prude, but this gal Mira James has a hormone problem. She is in and out of bed with men she just met. The mystery is where is the stoy?"
4,"A breath of fresh, youthful air","What a nice find! This is a nice break from the heavy beach-read mysteries that are trying to outdo each other and CSI at the same time. This is a fresh look at the mystery, where the solution lies as much with the quirky characters that inhabit our heroine's small town as in the physical evidence. What really kept me reading was the emotional, intelligent and giggle-out-loud humorous outlook of out lead character. She's a nice conduit for our own reactions to this world of diners, seniors, and bait shop regulars. The book takes place in a well-drawn rural community that exudes a definite sense of history. I'm looking forward to the ""months"" to come."
2,Could have been better,"I wanted to like this book, but I was immediately turned off by the narrator's voice. Chapter One drew me in, even with the annoying narrator, because it started the book out with a dead body. However, rather than continuing to follow the murder, the next SIX chapters were backstory. I frankly had no interest in what apartment the narrator had lived in before she moved to Battle Creek, nor did I care about the cockroach that started it all. I wanted to know what happened to the dead guy (who is much more likeable than the main character). I was disappointed that once the narrative returned to the murder, the main character walks around feeling superior to all the locals she's interviewing to track down the killer. I just could not tolerate the book."
5,May Day is a page turner!,"I absolutely enjoyed reading every page of this cozy mystery novel. Jess Lourey is a new author to me and May Day is the first novel in Lourey's Murder-by-Month Mysteries series. I look forward to reading the rest of the Murder-by-Month Mysteries series.I love Jess Lourey's writing style. She knows how to create a great story that captures and holds your attention from page one. I actually read this book in three days.Best of all, the lead character Lourey has created, Mira James, is like a breath of fresh air. Ms. James is smart, witty and different from other leading cozy sleuths I've read of late."
1,not-a-good-one,Was not impressed with this e-book. It was not the style that I enjoy. Content left a lot to be desired and appeared to have been written by a writer without experience.
1,may day is right,"sorry,found nothing redeeming with this book. main charecter was not likable,horrible plot line.i read to be entertained and escape real life not to be brought into the thick miasma of this plotline. should of known with this title may day is right. get me out of here!"
1,May Day,Do not recommend this book. Doesn't anyone know how to write without insert disgusting descriptions of sex and perversion. No thanks. I'll buy the work of other authors. I also no longer trust the reviews I find in Amazon.
2,Keep losing interest,"One caveat: I haven't actually finished this book. I keep stopping because I get bored. The mystery may be very clever and interesting, but the narration reads like the diary of Bridget Jones' less interesting cousin. Who's an American. And lives in Minnesota. Nothing against Minnesota, but this book isn't making anyone more excited to visit.The most redeeming quality of this book was that it was free."
2,I didn't enjoy it,It took forever to get through this book. IT was rather boring and I didn't really like the main character.
3,easy fun read,"I enjoy reading the Murder by Month Mystery series by Jess Lourey. they're inexpensive and are an easy, fun and quick read ."
3,Assistant librarian turns amateur sleuth,"In this novel, Mira James, assistant librarian, stumbles across a body in the stacks. To make matters worse, the body turns out to be that of her current boyfriend, Jeff Wilson. Unbeknownst to Mira, Jeff had ties to the town which may have resulted in his death. Convinced the local police cannot do an adequate job investigating the crime, Mira is determined to do a little digging of her own. An okay read. Murder by Month Series, Book 1."
3,Cute,"Mira returns to rural life to housesit for a friend. She finds work as a part time reporter and assistant librarian. Romance is in the air till Mira's love interest is found on the library floor, dead, BY Mira. She delves into rural town history and attempts to find the murderer. A fun little book about small towns and all their charm and quirks."
3,"I love crime fiction, but I didn't love this","I don't know what the author's definition of humorous and fun is, but we clearly don't see eye-to-eye on that point. It's not terrible by my standard. I was ok with the gore and erotica-level sex, but I guess I was really looking for more mystery, more suspense. This book didn't deliver."
1,A little research goes a long way,"I am half tempted to put this book down and just forget it. If you insist on mimicking the dialect of Southerners, please get it right. Otherwise, it is simply annoying. The word y'all is plural not singular. If you cannot get it right then don't bother trying."
3,"OK, but not great","This disjointed collection of three stories is only minimally tied together by all three heroines passing through Sundae's, a diner in NYC. The first story's telling in the second person makes it hard to follow. The second's poor-me heroine is kind of irritating. The third story, about the waitress, is by far the best."
2,Chick Lit,"Sundae's is the common thread running through this anthology that begins with What You Wish For, a slightly difficult to read introspecitve, angsty piece told in second person that examines whether or not a certain man is right for the heroine. Though broken by first person views, from time to time, the primary view makes it rather hard to follow. Next comes Lola Was Here, dealing more with career issues than romance. Lola wants to make it in New York as a photographer, but has doubts until in Sundae's she meets a man who calms her fears and inspires her to see possibilities. In the final entry, the heroine does not just pass through Sundae's, she works there as a waitress, which is the title of the story. Yet, she wants more and dreams of being a writer. However if she makes it, let us hope that her writing is more engaging than the stories in this anthology. If more fleshed out, they might be more appealing, but as it is, there seemed to be something missing.Reviewed by Amanda Killgore."
1,Do Not Fit Sidekick 2,I just received those and I am returning them back to amazon. They do not fit the monitor for a Sidekick 2 - looks lik ethey are for the older models. The protectors are too tall and too narrow for the screen.
1,not as advertised,This screen protector is designed for the Sidekick 1 not the Sidekick 2. Also not as easy to apply without these micro bubbles as they would have you think. Screen looks bad with this on. I followed the directions properly. I'll find some other brand.
1,Do Not Purchase,These screen protectors are not good AT ALL. The texture of the plastic makes the screen difficult to see. Why is the plastic textured? No idea. But it's awful.
2,They're about as hip as knee-hi pantyhose.,"I guess they fit my Sidekick II screen okay. The problem is that they're freaking bubbly. I was imagining a barely noticeable layer on the screen, but these things are all thick. I tried smoothing it, but it still looks crazy - like cheap bubble-tinted car windows."
1,Don't waste your money,These screen protectors are so textured you can hardly see the Sidekick screen. Don't waste your money on these.
1,Sidekick screen protectors,"Unfortunately, the quality of these screen protectors is poor due to low/blurred visability of the SideKick screen after application. Returned & credit was received promptly."
5,A Beautiful and Talented Album of Artistry,One Voice is a great group of females. My brother works with them and they told him to pick it up I'm glad he did because now I can enjoy the fabulous AlbumKeep Makin' It Work
5,a combination of tight beats and sweet melodies,"All I gotta say is ""You Gotta Get This Album""!!! If you like music by Aaliyah, you'll love One Voice's ""When You Think About Me"" and ""All Day, All Night"". If you like sweet slow jams, you gotsa GOTSA check out ""Here I Go"" and ""Always On My Mind"". This album is well produced and every song is a hit- absolutely no fillers. The album booklet is humongous. There are like 16 pages but the music is what makes this album truly extraordinary. It's like a breath of fresh summer air. It's not ""Just The Beginning"", it's everything."
5,Why are the haters scared to show there names?,"All of you that are hating on this project never show your names? Are you cowards or something. If you're gonna say something, put your backbone behind it. If you rate the CD with a 4 star, how are you gonna turn around and say you don't like it? The black voice this the black voice that, how many racists are there? I think the production and vocals were fine for a debut album. If their so weak, why is their song blowing up all over the country? Grow up and shut up haters. Peace."
3,Great lyrics..great beats.. weak vocals..,I think it's great that Asians are breaking into the music scene! I listen to this CD all the time because of the beats and the words. Though I have to say that the vocals are weak and somewhat empty. I think this CD would have been much better had they sang with passion and heart.
3,3 stars for effort. Relies on beats too much.,"Yes. 3 stars for effort and for making it this far. True audiophiles will, no doubt, notice that the vocals of this group are truly bland, passionless, and many times out of tune. Some other reviewers have used such words as ""thin,"" ""monotonous,"" and ""repetitive"" to describe the music of One Voice. The members of this group don't seem to have the lungs to sing this kind of music. The music in this cd sounds more karaoke quality than recording studio quality.The verdict: One Voice needs more Vocal lessons. Superstar singers have the right vocal instructors and/or a spectacular marketing team.However, no matter how badly they sing, Americans need to give them a chance in a market that is dominated by [few]. Then again, they need much more practice to get their foot in the door. All superstars have worked very hard to get where they are now. One Voice needs to work a little harder."
1,"A music fan from Portland, Oregon May 18, 1999","yup, this cd is just ANOTHER TYPICAL ASIAN GROUP. Nothin special...my sisters sings pretty much like them...your right man, these girls just got a break. Not worth buying."
3,"""When U Think About Me"" is dope.","I can't figure out what it is about this song, but it does it for me. ""When U Think About Me"" is the sexiest song of the year. The beat is tight, vocals are sexy and smooth, and I can't get enough of it. I wish they sold it in a single though."
4,nice,"This CD has some pretty nice songs. Their voice is not as good as the group, Pinay. The track are R&B with some Rap, Pop and Dance which is kool to listen to. This is a great start for their first CD. I didnt like this one song, ""Lovin You""...it sounds tacky. Overall, this CD is good."
4,Once you hear it you won't stop,"One voice.. you only need to hear it one time, and you'll fall for it like that.. it's a great cd. I only heard one of their songs once, and had to get the CD. Now, I can't stop listening to it, especially No. 5, 8, & 9. It's a great CD. And they give they don't show that ""typical asian"" stereotype in their music. They are great! ""Just The Beginning"" is true for this group, this IS just the beginning for them, they are on the rise..."
5,a great cd,"i just wanted to say that this cd is so good. you always hear ""When you think about me"" in the clubs. this cd has a lot of good songs. i suggest you go and bye a copy for your self"
4,What's wrong with it?,"I thought the songs were great. When I first heard All Day All Nite, I had to have the cd. I had no idea who they were until I walked into the cd store and they were playing When You Think About Me."
2,eh,"I bought this cd because I loved the song ""All day,all night.""But that turned out to be the only song I liked.And after hearing it about 10 times I got sick of it.so in conclusion I have to say that they arent anything special.They are corny and they dont wright there own music."
4,Dunwoody uses it -- you should too,"I went to Dunwoody Institute, and their electrical department uses this as a textbook for future electricians. The biggest downside is it doesn't cover some of the low voltage/HVAC in the depth that it does everything else. It has constant code references, but it also explains things plainly enough that most people can understand them. It is a little expensive, but I would definately recomend it."
3,Made Well,"I used this food mill to process an over abundance of tomatoes from my garden. It worked pretty well but be prepared for a messy job. For the price, it worked as advertised. Made well with strong gauge stainless steel. Wear an apron!"
3,Not for unpeeled potatoes,"I purchased this hoping it would save me time preparing Thanksgiving dinner. I had hoped it would be able to rice potatoes and remove the peels...not so. While the mill is strong and sturdy, the blade did not fit closely enough to really remove peels. It did however work nicely sifting flour. I hope it does a better job making applesauce.Additionally, it was pretty heavy and it was difficult to find a bowl to fit it.I should have believed the reviews I read, but it just looks so great...next time I shall just buy a potato ricer."
2,For lightweight tasks,"This item is attractive in its appearance and design. However, it is difficult to use for canning tomato juice.This mill lacks the wire that dispenses with the pulp on the underneath side which is very much needed for such an application. It also seems to be lacking tension in the rotary portion of the blade and therefore leaves a lot of juice and pulp resulting in waste and a less rich canned product.From having used many in the past, I immediately noticed these disparities and overall it is a product for very lightweight tasks in my opinion."
1,RSVP Endurance SS Food Mill,"I had great expectations for this food mill, especially for tomatoes and making sauce. This product was a HUGE disappointment. The tomatoes i used were parboiled for 7 minutes making them extremely mushy. But the food mill only pushed them along. I had more luck putting them in a screen basket and working them with a potato masher. It was a total flop. This mill may be good for mashed potatoes or applesauce but then hey, why not just use a potato masher instead of using AND WASHING all these parts. Not one of my better amazon choices."
4,Very nice for the price,"Very nice ricer for the price. Large enough to handle 2 cups of vegetables all at once. Clean up is easy as long as you do it immediately after use. Pretty heavy constuction, expect it to last for quite awhile."
2,8-inch TALL bowl/pot required - see pictures,"First off, I really wanted to like this food mill. The price is right, the qualityis heavy, nice looking and there are no sharp edges.However, the food mill hangs off the top, which means there is 4.25 inches below the rimof your bowl or pot. That's not practical as I'm not going to process a lot of stuff to warrant mystock pot and using a step ladder (I'm short). I should be able to cook say 6 apples and dump them in the millplaced on top of a bowl. Or, puree a few carrots.Just see the pictures.I ruled out OXO because of the price and plastic parts. If I get another food mill it will be one that has legs to sit on top of a bowl.For canning tomatoes and berries, I will probably purchase the Victorio.Victorio VKP250 Model 250 Food Strainer and Sauce MakerI am returning the RSVP Endurance food mill without testdriving it as I saw it wouldn't work for me right off the bat."
3,Out of California,"Mr. Fast has produced another book in the series of Lavette family histories. It is a fine assemblage of interesting characters and vignettes, though somewhat struggling to keep the generations moving into the post-1960's world.An additional aspect of interest is its attempt to understand life in California. The fictional format offers the reader glimpses into understanding the unique history, economy, sociology, demography, and politics of the state. Mr. Fast brings together the melting pot of California -Yankee, immigrant, Chinese, Chicano, and Jew. It is worthwhile to note the distinctions and rivalries between the North (San Francisco) and the south (Los Angeles). It provides a view of its politics and power circles, eager to assert their power as demonstrated in their support of a native son, Richard Nixon. And it tries to portray the state in transition in the second half of the Twentieth Century.It is a worthy read for the genre."
3,No Is The Answer,"An interesting, deeply researched and considered work that spends much of the time debunking the idea of the mind-body dualism. Dr. Elbert submits that the ""soul"" is merely brain created consciousness. By way of conclusion, in an effort to allay the fear of death in a soul-less physical world, Dr. Elbert submits the rather depressing idea that ""after you die, there will be no experiences, including the sense of time."" Somehow, I did not feel better to know this. What Dr. Elbert ignores is that due to man's wiring, including the self-preservation instinct, fear of death is the main-spring of all human activity.Further, his rather banal idea, that there is only a physical world, and the supernatural be damned, is just as limiting and narrow-minded as his opponents view.Thus, the tome essentially fails to enlighten and ultimately reaches a disappointing climax. In the end, he told me, albeit quite well, what I already knew, but added nothing else."
2,Passable primer for physics; pretty boring otherwise,"A promising effort which ""loses its soul"" as it moves away from hard science into a predictable (!) bleat for determinism. The discussion on neuroscience would improve substantially with the added ideas of Calvin and Kauffman. About twice as long as it should be too - a three star effort gets docked one star for unnecessary time-wasting."
5,Perfect soap,The soap and the fragrance are long lasting. The fragrance is the perfectly balanced blend of patchouli and rose. I will purchase this product again. Highly recommended.
5,Great Classic of Social Justice,"This is a wonderful reprinting of a timeless classic. It is a much needed primer for social justice issues and a wonderful resource. I would not be surprised if a second edition appears soon, updated to include writings on the modern tragedies of the Terror War, torture, renditions, and other international human rights crimes."
4,nice info,I have been mostly pleased with this book. The quality of the paper is good - not the newsprint type that some books have. The designs are on one side of the paper. There are explinations of each mandala and colour suggestions. My only complaint is that some of the designs are very simplistic
2,don't bother with this,"why all the rave about this product? The spaces are very small, as are the designs themselves and are hard for me to look at for very long at all. I am sending this one back as soon as I can; I won't color it at all. I am not saying these designs are for younger kids, just for those with VERY sharp eyes and very thin pcolored pencils. With one exception these designs are enough to give almost anyone headaches! I just hope there is someone out there who will enjoy this and be able to color it. The words to the side indicate religious significance. I hope it is helpful to someone"
2,power mandalas book,The description of this used book did not indicate that two of the actual mandala drawings were already colored. In a coloring book I believe this should be indicated.
5,Empowering Mandalas,How can you miss with Mandalas that emote POWER? This one arrived at my elderly friend's place along with the three others. She loved looking at the pictures even without coloring them.
5,GOTENKS IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!,"THE FIGHT BETWEEN GOTENKS AND BUU WAS AS HILARIOUS AS IT WAS AWESOME!GOTENKS ALSO GOES SUPER SAIYAN 3. AND...WELL I WON""T SPOIL IT FOR YOU> BUY IT!!! A MUST HAVE FOR ANY DBZ FAN LATA #1 SON!!!!!"
3,I liked Gotenks but to much talk & less violence(by Kasem),It was O.K. but as I said there is to much darn talking like every darn DBZ DVD (or VHS) other than that I like it.rated:PG if you don't mind seeing a lot of a good butt kicking& it's 3.5
3,Review of Fly Away Home,I think this book was a very good book. I liked it because it was about a girl who helped migrate geese.Her father was a inventor so that made the book very interesting. I think this book was a very well written book. I would tell others to read this book.
2,jazz,"Hmm sounds good, jazzy and chic. This should only be played in lounges. The only tracked I liked was amour. The rest I wanted to close my ears. Too much noise."
5,Hotel Costes,"A friend introduced me to what started out as ambient and carried me into the world of down tempo, especially bosanova. I listened to it all from K&D to in house mixes. I have a huge arsenal of down tempo to please all. As my musical tastes enrichens so does my scrutiny for only the best. Without question Pomppougnac continues to walk on water with his ability to master his talents and put together a mix that makes my mouth water. I eagerly anticipate every new release. If you choose to pass it will be to your regret for any compilation put together by this mozart of down tempo would be a missed opportunity of divine enlightenment."
4,Paris Under A Groove reflects the true parisian underground,"I agree with the other review listed here. I purchased Paris Under A Groove and it has been in my Cd player for months.It is not some prancy, pretentious light electro CD like Costes. It has more rich beats, grooves, and electro funk.If you want the true version of French underground electronica then go get Paris Under A Groove and hear the various stylings of new cutting edge musicians from Paris like Florian, Kia, Terrase Tranquille, The Bottle, Inckel and it includes a rare unreleased downtempo hit from St germain the godfather of french electronica.Paris Under A Groove reflects the spirit of the contmeporary french artist/ musician that works in his studio drinking wine and smoking incessantly, while creating a unique fusion of jazz, funk, deep house electronica that is unique to the region. Check it out and enjoy."
5,The Best Costes Compilation Yet,"Great cocktail music. Consistently upbeat tempo. Of the five Costes compilations, this is the best."
5,Take a Trip While You Lounge,"Each song has its own unique atmosphere without losing the touch of lounge. A sensual and sexy blend of space-age discoball sounds, sleek beats of drum n bass, hypnotic down-tempos, breakbeat style lounge, vintage sounds turned into a fashion cocktail catwalk scene, sexy latin pulses, sensual breathy french vocals, even a comical beat-like prose, all rolled up in a stylish compilation you can play over and over re-discovering each song again. It sweeps you off into a world of cosmic martinis, moonlight romance, hawaiian shirts on cruise ships, expensive perfume, elite glamour, beauty. Even if you are not into these things, you will enjoy the ride. I will be on the lookout for Stephane Pompougnac's next creation. This guy has good taste!"
3,Steady beat.....,"I'm aware that the underlying steady beat is part of the genre but when present, it just kills the groove and the polyrhythmic aspect of the music. it's sounds often like sophisticated disco to me."
5,Wow! :),I'm collecting all Stephane Pompogniac's compilations since I've heard the firtst 'Hotel Costes'. As for me - the best lounge&nu-jazz compilation ever! :)
5,HOTEL COSTES 5,"THIS ALBUM IS EXCELENT, THE GLAMOUR, THE RIGHT COMPILATION, THE MIXES ARE GREAT.THE BEST CHOICE FOR NICE PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD.THANKS"
3,Why won't the beating stop?!,"I'm a big fan of Tarentel's 3 earlier full lengths, but I can't wrap my head around this one. The melodic, structured, evocative and emotive elements of the previous releases are abandoned for something that seems more improvisational, with unexciting results. The most serious problem is that the drummer seems to have hijacked the recording sessions -- an insistent, prominent drum beat (which might have been interesting had it lasted for one track) dominates pretty much the whole album and makes listening a numbing and somewhat unpleasurable experience."
3,Love then failure,"This drive worked great, light weight, easy to transport and then it lost all data for unknown reason, reformated by computer guy and works again. Will continue to use but not for permanant back up."
5,Great Aerobics!,This video is all aerobics -- great for burning the fat. Gilad is easy to follow and has excellent form. If you follow his instructions and always do the warm up and cool down sections you shouldn't experience any pain. This is an energizing video!
4,Your body will thank you for it!,"Gilad makes you WORK off the pounds (""Eight more time!!!""), and this video is useful for anyone--at any fitness level--who wants to add intense aerobic activity to their excercise regimen. It's a 45 minute, breathtaking masterpiece!"
5,Great Video,"This is a great easy to use, easy to learn video. Gilad combines an upper and lower body workout that is pure old school aerobics. This is not a dance video, or a boxing video this is an aerobics video. The soundtrack is decent and he stayed away from current songs so it does not feel dated. He is motivating without being annoying the workout is fun. Although this is not a workout for a beginner one can modify it and work up to its level."
5,Can't go wrong with Gilad,"The winning formula present in this and other Gilad videos is uncomplicated, no-nonsense moves that get your heart pumping and increase your fitness level over time. What I like about this video in particular is that you really can modify the moves to your level of fitness. For example, I often run in place instead of marching, resulting in more challenging routine with probably twice as much fat burning. I would recommend that for advanced exercisers or those who are bored with the same routine. Gilad is a great coach, constantly motivating you to keep up your energy. This video is not as strenuous as ""Best of Bodies in Motion"", but it's great for when you're short on time and ready to sweat!"
4,Gilad Fat Burning Workout,"This is a great workout. It is easy to follow, but very high energy. DO NOT buy this video if you already have the Gilad Split Routine workout. The Fat Burning video in the Split Routine set is the same, although they have different covers and different copyright dates. Just want to save you the $ by giving you the headsup that they are the same videos!"
1,Fat Burning workout,The manufactured quality of the Video is awful. I had to stop and use the tracking function several times and never got a clear picture. (My VCR is realitively new and other videos are fine) It is imposssible to do areobics while fiddling with the tracking. Don't waste your money
1,Gilad tape isn't worth a try,"First if all, this tape is so dated. The picture quality is really bad. Secondly, Gilad goes non-stop through the aerobics segment. After a while my chest started hurting. A better bet would be Kathy Smith who works in intervals. And the incessant couning drove me nuts. And there is this one guy in he back who is so distracting. He keeps counting loudly and answering Gilad all the time. This tape is terrible. After a while, I just was hoping to end the bouncing around. It felt like the longest tape. The music is awful. I started muting it and playing my own cd's."
4,Perfect for YOU!!,"All the tracks in this album are just great. If you like Greek music, then this is ALL IN ONE!!!!All the great tracks are in this album...You will just love it."
1,"Great for some, but not for us","I really hate this animation-- its just downright *creepy.* I thought it was just me, but my 2.5 year old son hates it too (Ima, please turn this off.""). The stories aren't engaging and seem very very forced. The flying makes me motion sick (this may be the toddler's problem as well.) Into the bin, and (Yay!) no more Jay Jay in this house."
2,FLAMINGO HEAD COVERS,"I HAVE BEEN BUYING THESE FLAMINGO HEAD COVERS FOR YEARS. THEY CHANGED THE LOOK OF THEM, AND THE PICTURE DOES NOT MATCH THE ITEM ANYMORE. WAS KINDA DISSAPOINTED, LIKE THE OLD STYLE LOOK BETTER, LIKE WHAT THE PICTURE SHOWS."
1,Big Disappointment,"I thought it was a documentary about LA that I could show friends that come and visit me. Instead, it's just music with (great) pics of the city...but that's it. I guess you can put it in if you have a party...for some ambience. But besides that, it's completely useless. At least for me..."
3,Be forewarned...,"While occasionally coming across references to a jap lp sleeve issue of John Dawson Winter III, this is the only way to get the majority of that overlooked album that I'm aware of. Being obsessive and having to have those great songs, I ordered this disc despite having concerns that the label is not known to me.The sound quality is substandard, almost as if some processing or noise reduction isn't properly decoded. There are no highs on this cd, but if you gotta have it..."
2,After 40 days,"The product works fine (when working) and it's okay for the price. (general home use)But after 40 days of use, the motion sensor broke, and the recording stopped. I didn't know, since i set it on a continous loop. When I needed to review the recording's after being vandalized, the DVR was broken. So, in my case, this product was useless. For a security product it has to be reliable, this wasn't"
3,Heh - my dad wrote this!,"Gotta tell you the truth - I found this sort of boring. Of course, last time I can rememeber looking at it, I couldn't have been more than 14. Then again, what teenage boy *doesn't* like market evaluations of securities?Overall, not as good as his earlier work. I must have been distracting him too much."
5,Stunning photography!,"This book is full of some of the most stunning photos of Texas. Full of shots of awe inspiring weather and the landscapes below. Wyman Meinzer's photography is some of the best around and you can see why in this book. If you love Texas, scenery, various weather depictions and beautiful landscapes, then this is right up your alley. This is one of a few books that sits on my fireplace mantle for all to enjoy."
1,Never Buy this Sercure Key,Please search 'Schlage Securekey' from Google first before you buy this.The key does not work after few months. Product has been discontinued.....Don't buy this unless you want to waite your money.I can't believe Amazon is still selling this....
2,Amateurish look,"The DVD feels like a typical 80s educational video. The narration is boring and lacks detail. A great amount, say 80 percent is shot from the driver's view, with the ""supposed"" tester whispering his explanation of what to do - poor acting by the way. It would have been better had they shown diagrams to help better understand the concept. I myself had difficulty with parking especially parallel; the DVD completely ignores this part of the test. The DVD was shot for the Canadian market, thus speed limits listed on the DVD is in kilo meters instead of miles. Some of the rules stated do not apply to American road rules. Overall the DVD had an amateurish feel."
4,Inner Lives of Children Skillfully Revealed,"Although this book was published in 1991, the ideas, attitudes, and spiritual insights of the children interviewed are as fresh and important as when the discussions first occurred. As adults we tend to dismiss the ability of children to offer their own interpretation of the Divine. This book clearly shows that it is frequently the adults that don't ""get it."" I found it especially appealing that Coles did not limit himself solely to children with a Christian background. The inclusion of Muslim, Jewish, and Native American children indicates that children's spirituality cuts across religious and cultural lines. I only wish Robert Coles had included more interviews and drawings!"
5,A Book about Love and Nurturing,"Angel By My Side is not a book ""just"" about a dog. It is also not a book about an exceptional dog (Golden Retriever) oran average dog. Angel By My Side is a book about life. Thisbook is a book about what most all of us want in life: nurturing, acceptance, healing, attention, fun, and last but notleast: unconditional love. Anyone (child or adult) who is an animal lover or needs to hear a ""feel good"" story will love this book. I'm picking up several of the books for Christmas gifts."
5,Happy with Amazon.,"I have yet to be dissatisfied with my purchases through Amazon. Not only can I read reviews of the product I wish to purchase and the availability, the speed of receiving my purchases is unreal."
5,Excellent and so touching!,"I recently lost my Golden Angel too, and while I was looking for a book to helpMe cope with my pain, I found this book. I am a very busy person and don'tHave much time to read, but this book took me 2 days. It is full of feelings and even humor. No matter what the situation is, our Golden's will manage to put a smile on our face. When you start reading this book, make sure you have a box of KleenexNear by. This book goes into my favorite book list, and I purchased a few more asChristmas presents."
4,Just as it was described!,This product came just as it was described. There was confusion from UPS but it still arrived all the same. Love it!
3,Ok cleaner - nothing special,"I bought this cleaner to get rid of dirt stains on my laminated kitchen floor. However, even after multiple applications the stains remained so I will have to get a more potent cleaner to do the job. It seems to work fine for lesser stains so that is why I gave it a 3 star rating."
5,"Simple, effective and safe for kids",I have over 200 sq feet of tile in my house and I rally wanted something to clean light grime. I vacuum the floors then use a spray bottle to cover a 10x10 ft square on the tile. I use the great bona professional floor mop and good bye grime. It's best to rinse the mop several times as it prevents streaking. I do like how this product is safe for children and schools which means a lot for having a little rug and tile rat.
5,Floors are clean!,"Have used this product on my daughters floors. They looked great. So, I decided to order Bona Stone for my floors. Received the product in a timely fashion. Price was good. Would order again from seller."
3,Insufficient Research and Biased Writing,"Bruno Bettelheim, once the star among educators and sociologists, has been widely discredited in recent years. When I first read this book, I sense what was coming; I expected that Bettelheim was going to ""reveal"" whether the Kibbutz was a model utopia or a failed experiment. What he ""reveals"" is that the children born to the Kibbitz are emotionally sterile and can't experience or provide love and happiness.Bettelheim's research was not enough. He must have gone (by taxi) to a Kibbutz, chatted with the residents, and left. He didn't go deep enough into the questions of sexuality, intimacy, and development that obviously fascinated him. There is more than one Kibbutz in Israel, and some are more spartan than others. Some have families living in private quarters, while others require that the children sleep together in a dormitory, not with their parents.The bottom line is, Bettelheim traded on his fame. Few educators take his work seriously anymore."
4,The gang life,This book is very accurate about kids in gangs trying not to get killed. I lived in a part of town where most kids are in a gang. The drug Dealers in my neighborhood were always looking for more turf to make more money just like Deek. I moved out here and had to chose if i wanted to join a gang. after trying it for a bit I decided not to though I would Like to be in a gang like the firends.
2,Pretentious and over-written,"I give Mowry credit for trying to reveal the world of gang kids without being preachy, but the writing style strains so hard to be hip that I figure the author must be having a mid-life crisis. Read anything by Madison Smart Bell (Ten Little Indians, the Washington Square Ensemble) covering similar subject matter and you'll see how bad Mowry is in comparison. Sorry -- sometimes the truth hurts."
3,Roosevelt: A Raw Deal,"One thing I like about this book is that its copyright was in 1948. Not much time had passed and I believe a more genuine, objective view is given here of this period. The reason for the three stars is because it isn't an interesting read. Details are glossed over; and has many generalizations which may or may not be fact. Also, the author offers very few references and sources.However, one detail in this book jumped out at me. Having read a number of books on the McCarthy investigations, I wondered when the communist infiltration had started. Lo and behold in this book the author states, ""(the New Deal) these bureaus became roosting places for droves of communist termites who utilized their positions as far as they dared to advance the interests of Soviet Russia..."""
3,Los Platters Latinos,"Este disco es una muestra representativa de lo que el grupo hizo luego de sus grandes √©xitos con Columbia. El contenido es muy bueno, aunque prefiero sus anteriores producciones con Columbia porque encotr√© que la orquestaci√≥n de Lucio Milena le daba un marco perfecto a la interpretaci√≥n del grupo y la hac√≠a resaltar. Con todo lo anterior lo recomiendo para redondear la colecci√≥n de cualquier admirador del grupo, que aunque una versi√≥n latina de los Platters, siempre supo mantener su identidad de latinoame- ricanos."
5,Who did it??????????,"Talk about a climax at the end! Everyone i know who read it and i tried to figure out who did it. Truley kept us guessing. I thought i wouldn't last until the next book came out as i couldn't figure out who did it...just too many suspects. to choose from. I try and tell everyone about these books--makes lively discussions. Doesn't matter if you are religious or not. Yes, they are based on the book of Revelation in the Bible and yes, what they talk about it told there but the otehr parts are fiction and it is an easy to read format. I don't think ti gets too preachy. i enjoyed reading the books and can't wait until the new one comes out."
1,This could have been a lot better,"After reading Assassins, I determined that I will not read any more of these books. This one rehashed too much old material and did not do enough to advance the plot. It was predictable and poorly written. The first book in the series was by far the best. The rest have gone downhill steadily. It seems to me that these have become potboilers...a money machine. It really is too bad, because I would like to be able recommend this series to my non-Christian friends, but I just can't do it. They would never again listen to a recommendation from me."
4,Pretty Good!,I'm a very big fan of the Left Behind Series but this book moved a little slow. I really hate the fact that it will take 6 more books to finish (3seems to be enough).
3,"This book was very slow, but the storyline will pick up . .","This book ran much, much slower than the other five. I think that the reason that the plot was so slow is that we are waiting for the assissination to occur and this, of course, will not happen immediately in the book. Another thing to keep in mind if you are going to read this book is that the authors are trying to keep the plot in line with the bible.This is an excellent series however. I recommend it to everyone."
4,book 6 left behind series,This book just wants you to keep on reading to find out how this ends. empressive way the authors leave you wondering..
2,Disappointing,"I guess I'm giving up on this series, each new book is worse than the last. I have read a number of other books in this genre which have been recommended in these reader reviews, including Nichols THE FIST OF GOD, Peretti's THE VISITATION, and Kleier's THE LAST DAY. Of all these, THE LAST DAY is by far the very best read. It has complex plotting, tight-scripted prose and dialogue, fast pace, and one of the most surprising, exciting stories I've read in years. If you're looking for a good book recommendation, that is my two cents worth!"
2,Has success spoiled Mr. Jenkins and Mr. LaHaye?,"I've read and recommended this series to a number of friends since the first book came out. However, Apollyon and Assassins do not begin to equate in quality with the initial books. I have read other reviews saying the ""cash cow"" has come into play here and I regret that I must agree. With the upcoming movie of ""Left Behind"", I felt that the authors were writing Assassins more as a screenplay than a novel. Please Mr. Jenkins and Mr. LaHaye, return to your prior quality writing. The movie rights will take care of themselves as will the screenplay! Leave the ""who-dun-it"" theatrics out because it just cheapens an otherwise invaluable series of books."
3,"Fascinating subject, rather amateurish writing","This series is an anthology of Revelation. The style is predictable, sometimes boring, but the subject offsets much of that. Written from the standpoint of a fundamentlist view, subtly anti-Catholic. If you don't take it too seriously, or literally, it is fun and keeps your interest."
2,AAAAHHHHH!!!!!,"I was very disappointed in this book. I've read all the others, of course, absolutely loved the way they put Revelations in understandable, modern terms, and was anxious to get the next saga. However, I was extremely disappointed with everything about this book, including its ending. It was just more of the same ugliness that was stretched to fit the book. I think a lot of the repetitive descriptions could have been left out, more meat put in, and an ending that gave you what the whole book lead up to. I won't buy the next books."
2,I hate to disappoint you but...,"I have really enjoyed this series. I have eagerly awaited each new book. It seems that the authors would have been more suited to write the entire series, and then just released a condensed version. The newest book, Assassins, would have taken up up about 20 pages in that condensed volume. I usually don't skip entire sections due to lack of interest, but in this case, the whole book was skippable until the last chapter -- which is unfinished! (The second star was awarded for such good marketing). I can no longer justify keeping up with this series any longer, in fact, it pains me to think that I have recommended it in the past...!"
5,The best of the bunch,"As much as I have enjoyed the previous books, this one by far has been the most exciting and thought provoking. If you are still unsure about your future, this installment will definitely help sway you in the right direction. I particulary like the way the authors introduce additional characters into the story without cramming them in at once and how they focus on the relationships between the characters. I finished this within 48 hours of buying it and I can't wait to read the next installment. It's all coming together in ways you don't expect!"
1,Born again Christian propaganda,"Worst book I've ever read - I usually like stuff like this (The Omen, etc..) but this was really poorly written. The character development was poor. The born again christian propaganda was way to heavy (and obviously the goal of the book, as opposed to entertainment)."
1,"Sheer commercialism, with only mediocre literary merit.","This book (and series) is nearly unreadable, and evidently millions have been suckered into shelling out the bucks for each new installment. Any perceptive reader would realize that the scenarios plotted are absolutely implausible, that the world would not nearly sustain the kind of technological infrastructure remaining in the wake of such catastrophic disaster, and the errors in characterization (Rayford, anyone?) are annoying to the point of distraction. Never let it be said that these authors shine with brilliance, for such obtuseness will be met with right vindictive emotive capacity."
4,Get's Better,Now the story picks up and get's interesting again. The characters that you have grown to know and care about are in a safe house. This book is quicker to read and the story moves at a fast pace. You can't put it down because you want to see what happens next.
4,OK,"This book was like a pause between the fifth book and the seventh. Reads fast. Same characters. You can not put it down.All of the Left Behind series from the first book to The Mark could have been condensed into 3, if not 2, books."
1,They've assassinated the series!,"Please, Jerry, Tim, it's time to move on. You've wrung as much from this bleak concept as you possibly can, and the sponge is dry. If you need inspiration, go read Glenn Kleier's THE LAST DAY. There is no better crafted a Judgment Day story than that. And while you're biting your nails over it, check out the depth of plot, characters and prose. THAT'S a novel with substance. No more pablum, please!"
2,This book alone would not be enough to capture my interest,"I have read and thoroughly enjoyed the previous books of the Left Behind series, but found Assassins to be sluggish. As I read this story, I couldn't help but feel that it had been written by a different author. Its style is not consistent with the other books in area of character development. I felt as though I was turning pages to give me a mere ""update"" into their perilous situations. Rayford's moodiness, Leah's brash personality, Buck's indifference to his family, Chloe's disappearance into the woodwork all left me bored. The authors, however, did a good job of stringing me along to the next book with the last few chapters. The ending provided some hope that the next book will have some answers, action and get back on track with character development. The subject matter here is incredible!"
5,Made me ask questions!,Thanks for another winner! It took only one day to read and was held captive to see what happened next. The characters seem so real and human in their everyday feelings and doubts. We must be certain of our salvation! Question: Is it ok for a Christian to kill the Antichrist?
3,"Character, not action driven","Easily the slowest-paced book in the series. The last 10 pages were great, but the rest was soooo disappointing. Even the first book in the series was more interesting. Granted, Soul Harvest and Apollyon were riveting and rich in character developemnt, Assassins seems to have slowed the pace of the series significantly. Of course, after reading that the series will now double, it's clear to see the author's goal: Milk this series for more money. Utterly disappointing as the series started off so well. Also, the women continue to be afterthoughts. Even the Bible itself has more exciting, strong women in it. I hope the next book has more of the author's passion and this was just a lull, not a foreshadowing of the rest of the series."
5,"Very intense and true to the series, does not let you down.","Assasains is a very fast paced book, probably the most intense of the six books so far. The only problem I have with this book is that I have to wait until spring to get the next book in the series."
2,No more than a witnessing tool.,"If your faith needs a boost, maybe this will help, but as literature, it's wanting. The characters are paper thin, the writing lackluster, and the plot, decidedly simplistic. For readers who are looking for quality along with a jolt of realistic end-time terror, there are no better novels than Glen Kleier's ""The Last Day,"" or Stephen King's ""The Stand."" Try either of these and you'll know what an adrenaline rush really is."
1,Fiction? This guy thinks he is writing a bible sequel,"Let me say this first, I believe in GOD! This book is pure hogwash. This whole notion of God Vs. the devil is nothing more than a step backwards for our struggling culture. This book gives the reader the idea that their is a devil here on earth making people do bad things, and we need a savior to ""save"" us all. I don't buy it one bit. There is no evil force turning our souls rotten, what happened to free will. I hate it when people start talking about hell and heaven as tangible places where our souls actually go. These places and peoples (Satan, angels, etc.) are dreams of a confused animal that has lost its way. True immortality comes from within the heart and mind, as well as through our offspring which shares half of our genetic infomation. Face it, there is no such thing as heaven, hell, or the devil - they are metaphors for our own insecurities!"
2,Running out of steam,"After reading ASSASINS and all its LEFT BEHIND precursers, I've noticed a trend toward decreasing quality as the saga continues. Let me say that all of these Judgment Day novels--LEFT BEHIND series, THE VISITATION, etc., none of them can hold a candle to the nerve-racking suspense and realism of the true End Time classic of them all, THE LAST DAY, by Glenn Kleier. THE LAST DAY remains the high water mark against which I measure any such attempts, and all of these have proven weak disappointments, in comparison."
4,Best in the series since the first installment.,"This book contained more of the things I had been looking for: descriptions of life during the tribulation period; action; more illustration of the GC leadership, Nicolae and Leon in particular. Having been disappointed with Apollyon, this book was very satisfying. More pages could have been devoted to the Gala Celebration, as too much flew by too quickly. Also, I like cliffhangers, but this one is a little too much! I don't see why the resurrection of the ""shooting victim"" could not have been included here, i.e. go about 50 pages further. Not knowing who the ""assassin"" was at this point is not a problem. Bottom line: very well done, considering the challenge they have before them."
4,Left Behind series,"As I said in the previous reviews of all the books that I have bought, of the ""Left Behind"" series, which is well over 15.They were all for my granddaughter, who is in her ""twenties"", and she's read them all.I am not an avid reader, so I don't know about them personally.I take her word for it, that they are GOOD !!"
3,Left Hanging,"Like the previous books in the series, I couldn't put this one down, waiting to learn who would assassinate Carpathia. I found the ""Who shot J.R."" cliffhanger to be very disappointing, although I will, of course, buy/borrow the next book in the series.As far as Rayford is concerned, his change in attitude IS disturbing. I think it is meant to be. He has forgotten to trust in the Lord and come under the influence of the devil, who probably would prefer the PR value of having a Christian kill Carpathia. I actually think the Lord prevented Rayford from carrying out his plan and one of the others committed the act."
3,"There is an alternative, Thank God","I don't hate Left Behind. In fact, to begin with it looked like it might be a pretty good series. Now it just drags on and on with subplots and characters I find it hard to care about. There's HARDLY ANYTHING about the Tribulation. Thank God I heard about the end times series THE CHRIST CLONE TRILOGY by James BeauSeigneur. First of all, it sticks to the story. Even better, BeauSeigneur explains WHY and HOW the events of the Tribulation happen instead of just having them occur with no logical explanation."
3,Finally Back to Moving the Plot and Characters Along,"The first three books in the series did an excellent job of moving the plot along, while riding a delicate balance with strong character development. Then books four and five hit -- more preachy material than story or character development. Total busts, IMHO. Book six, on the other hand, jumps back to the excellent writing style of plot/character development that the first three books promised. At this point in the series, this is the best book of the six."
2,Couldn't keep me interested...,"Book six of a story that should have been told in three books!The concept of the series is captivating, but considering the lack of creativity in the writing, story, and character development, I lost interest by book four. Continued on to book five because of morbid curiosity, then started book six, but three quarters through, put it down without the slightest interest in finding out what the big cliffhanger was going to be this time.I was most disappointed with the lack of religious depth. End times theory was totally glossed over and addressed only superficially.The biggest objection though, was the shameless way the authors have tried to stretch this ""Left Behind"" cash cow over as many books as humanly possible. Each book (from book 3 on) was filled with page after page of what can only be described as filler! Summaries of experiences from past books, and endless retelling of the character's personal ""left behind"" experiences."
2,Who Said What???,"Give me a break! The dialogue in Assassins was ridiculous. At times, I didn't know who said what. It would have been nice if the authors could have written decent tag lines with the dialogue. It might have added more depth to the characters. A much better Christian fiction novel was LUMINOUS by Peter Quest."
3,Betting Better,"The latest installment of the Left Behind series is an improvement over Soul Harvest, but not as good as the beginning of the series. The author teases the readers with new questions: What impact will the end days have on the mental stability of believers? How far can christians go in fighting the Antichrist?There is a good dose of action, but the authors do not perform well when developing key events. (The death of the 2 witnesses is unusally quick as is their resurrection.) Also, the foreshawdowing for the future books is somewhat heavy handed.However, when I placed the book down, I was happier than I was with the last and interested in confirming my own suspicions of who killed the antichrist, where was Hattie, and will Rayford pay a price for being there?"
4,Let's get to the end,"Is it just me or are they trying as hard as possible to stretch this series out as far as they can? I do love the books, but Apollyon dragged a little and Assassins drags a lot. It is good to be able to see so much of each character, but do we really need this series to be open ended? Let's start to tie up some of the loose ends and finish this thing up. It is a great book though, and I did enjoy every minute of it."
2,Enough with this series already!,"I agree with a number of other reviewers that this series has stretched on way past where it should have stopped. The original Left Behind novel started off well, but it seems the length of the series was stretched by publishers who wanted to make as much money as possible off of the series. I see no reason why ""The Indwelling"" and ""Assassins"" couldn't have been merged into a single book. A lot of what the authors put forward was rehashed in previous books, like a television soap opera with Monday and Friday shows that mirror each other. Those still interested in reading well written, realistic scenarios of the apocalypse should read The Christ Clone Trilogy and Conquest of Paradise instead. Both those books were a lot more believable, and they didn't need twelve books to tell a good story!"
3,A very weak start and a strong finish,"Maybe the previous book spoiled me but Assassins was SO very tedious until maybe two thirds of the way through that I found myself rushing just to get it over with. It dragged and droned with cardboard speeches and a sudden character morph. In any series of fiction a willing suspension of disbelief is needed. I was unable to generate it here. One of the strengths of the series is the possibility that this can happen. It is the thing that made the Exorcist the most frightning movie i've ever seen. This book loses that sense till near the very end. Every writer is entitled to one lemon, hopefully the is Lahaye's and Jenkins only one."
5,Another hit,"I would have never guesed how the book ended....it leaves you wanting book #7 right now!book 6 was probably my favorite so far...it's a toss up between books 1,2,3,4,5 & 6 for favorite...ok ok so I like them all. but book #6 is so far the best."
5,could not put it down,"The series Tim Lahaye has written has kept me on the edge of my seat. It has really awaken to what is going on in our world today. I am greatful for this series, for they have truly brought me closer to Christ."
1,"The tribulation ""force""? ...","Please. I admire Mr. LaHaye and Mr. Jenkins, but surely, this is the poorest written series, ever. I've gotten this far only because I was curious to find out what happened to one character. The writing is silly and implausible at times. None of the ""force members"" even remotely resemble some of the saints we read about in the Bible. The truth be told, these are the sorriest set of ""believers"" I've ever encounted. They are portrayed as lacking power and faith. You will find yourself wondering what they have actually accomplished since the Rapture. The series itself gives no actual insight into end times and is no doubt in favor of the pre-tribulation rapture. It makes no room or argument for a mid or post tribulation rapture. If you aren't a student of the Word you must not rely on any of these books to give you a clear or unbiased teaching on what believers can expect as we wait for Christ to return.I wouldn't recommend these books to anyone."
3,Not as suspenseful or as exciting as I'd hoped,"I read this book for entertainment, not for a religious purpose, so maby that's why it didn't hit me as particularly intriguing. I much preferred Glen Kleier's millennium novel, THE LAST DAY, which, while having spiritual components to it, didn't hit you over the head with it. LAST DAY also deals with the Book of the Apocalypse and Judgment Day, but from a very different and more thought-provoking perspective. In my view, ASSASSINS is a much less meaty novel. LAST DAY offers more food for the soul and the mind."
3,Cliffhanger,"Not a bad book, or story. I wish they would hurry up and finish it. Once the series is finished then I can give a better review."
1,I can't believe it,"I have managed to trudge through all 6 of these books out of sheer will to understand why it's so successful. I can't believe that books that lack depth, story, sense of characters, and are so badly written can be on the best sellers list.The characters in these books are unbelieveable, shallow, too perfect (after being saved), and totally uninteresting."
2,"Incomplete, choppy, rushed","The Assassins is not up to the standards set in the first two books. As the series progresses it appears that the focus is on getting the book to market instead of developing the plot and expanding on the prophecies of Revelation. If the schedule of two books per year is met, I doubt if I will buy any of the following books. The Assassins is chopped up to try and keep three story lines moving, there is repetition, and inconsistencies, not a good effort. It was a struggle to finish the book."
4,A page - turner without compare,"I ordered ""Assassins"" and ""The Triumph and the Glory"" last week for myself, and the three Harry Potter books for my son and we've been reading with great delight ever since! These Left Behind books are phenomenal! No, they aren't literary masterpieces, but they are rewarding reading for anyone who is mindful of the sorry course humanity has been on for a couple of millenia."
5,It brings reality to Revelation!!!,"What an awesome way to bring believers and non-believers alike in touch with Revelation. Biblical truths are expounded in the lives of fictional characters with unerring accuracy. It reads so much like our lives today that I could actually visualize the Rapture happening in my lifetime. Never have I read a book of fiction that felt more real. Tim Lahaye and Jerry Jenkins have joined the realm of success usually reserved for secular authors such as Tom Clancy. A truly great read if you are a Christian or just interested in a fast-paced page turner. As you race from country to country and crisis to crisis, you can hardly contain yourself. I couldn't put it down."
3,STARTING TO DRAG!,"LaHaye and Jenkins should try to finish the story with the next book or two. They're starting to ruin the quality of the writing. They need to think about the story, not the money that can be made by stretching the story. **** Anyway, if anyone is interested in reading a great spiritual thriller that they can finish in a weekend, read, 'THE FIST OF GOD' by A.T. Nicholas. It has a phenomenal plot with some cool twists. Great characters, fast paced, and a super message! But it does have some choice four letter words."
3,"You don't have to ""Star Wars"" it to keep me reading","I am getting very tired of the Hollywood ending in all forms of literature, not just yours, but your story is so great you don't need to resort to a Hollywood ending for us to buy it. Your books will loose their appeal to even the most devoted readers if another sequel comes out like this and you keep leaving it as you did with this one.I am only able to experience to your books on tape and would love it if they were offered in an Unabridged version, I would pay the extra money. It would be worth it to get the whole story and not feel like I am missing something when the story line takes an abrupt turn."
2,Sluggish and slow,"I am a believer, and I have been challenged by the Left Behind series to be more diligent in my Bible study and prayer life. However, with each new book in the series I feel that more words are used to cover less ground plot-wise. It's as though someone - the author, the publisher, I don't know who - is stretching this story out as far as it can possibly be stretched. Even the font size is bigger, and there are fewer lines per page! TWELVE BOOKS? Please, it's a great story, but someone, for some reason, is going overboard. I guess as long as people (like myself) are hooked and buy the latest installment, the series will go on. Maybe the next book will negate all of my complaints by resolving Hattie's dilemma(PLEASE!) and including more than one major plague and one major event."
2,A great series! But this is the weak link,"Tim Lahaye and Jerry Jenkins have created an excellent tale. Yet, the repeating story elements are a let down. I couldn't wait to get the book but like most of my friends we had trouble getting through it. I read all of the other books in one or two days.You have to read it to be positioned for the next book. But my hope is for less reflection and repetition in the upcoming story."
3,Rule of Sequals applies!,"I have enjoyed reading all of this series! However, as we progress in the book line the authors regale us by rehashing all of the other books many times over. It behoves me that they also wish to drag this story line out sooooo long."
2,There are much better endtime thrillers out there,"When you have a topic as rich with possibilities as this,readers should expect: #1 terrific writing, #2 strong characters, #3chills, thrills and hair curling suspense. Unfortunately, the LEFT BEHIND series disappoints on all levels. This is very lightweight stuff, people, in my opinion. The very finest of all endtimes novels, without question, is the quintessential Judgment Day suspense thriller, THE LAST DAY (Glenn Kleier, 1998, Warner books). If you want to read a gripping, intelligent and thought stimulating drama that will alternately fascinate you, amuse you, scare the living bejeebies out of you, and keep your mind boggled till the wee hours, there is none better. LAST DAY is the ultimate Last Day experience, and if you haven't read it yet, you're in for a soul-quaking treat. Not a one of these LEFT BEHIND novels comes anywhere close."
5,Makes you realize you know too many people going to hell.,"I think each book in this series is great! This one, more than the others , leaves you WAITING ON THE EDGE OF YOUR READING CHAIR for the next book to come! Yes, some of the content seems unreal, but it made me re-read Revalation, and I see where they get it from. VERY creative and wonderful authors!"
2,Assassins- Left Behind Book,"This was a used book. I didn't think this book was in great shape. The cover was torn quite a bit, as were some of the corners of the pages. It was readable though. I've ordered other used books through Amazon and this one wasn't up to par, as far as I was concerned."
4,Talk About A Cliffhanger!,"With eager anticipation we move toward the mid-week of the saga with speed and trepidation. I was pulling out my hair at the conclusion because now I have to wait for the next book to come out. Great ending, guys. Bravo, bravo."
3,HALF A BOOK!,"Assassins could have been combined with the last book or with the next one. I know this is a series, but it appears they're attempting to stretch the story out. (I hope it isn't out of greed!) I'll keep reading until the end, I'm looking forward to the next book.A reviewer highly recommended a novel called THE FIST OF GOD, by A.T. Nicholas on this site. Thank you reviewer for bringing that book to my attention , it was one of the best spiritual thrillers that I have ever read! I also highly recomend it."
3,Religious Fiction Book,"I was happy with my order, It arrived in good time, it was cheap and it was in good condition. Thank you amazon good job."
3,Too slow,"The content was good, but the story lines really dragged. The fourth book was the best so far. I had a hard time getting through this one. I have started number 7 which seems to be faster paced. The authors need to learn how to write better cliff hangars , they have the material they just need to learn how to keep it going.I do appreciate thier effort at bringing people to Christ and the truth to thoses who wouldn't hear it otherwise. Amen to them!"
3,Will I finish this series before the rapture?,"Ok, I took on the task of reading this series, because the first book was really good. But after that it gets more repetitive, and less believable. I contemplated skipping the rest of the books and buying the last one to see what happens, im sure i wouldn't miss much and would be caught up by the first 200 or so pages. Maybe I can just read the last of each book? I don't know, but I'm trying hard not to give up..The authors really should be ashamed of themselves for dragging this out."
2,"2,5 stars. Better than the rest so far.","With the exception of the first book, I've given the Left Behind sequels 1 star, mostly because of the extremely slow pace, where it feels like they took a few chapters and stretched them out to make a whole novel. The other problem is that they are preachy.Well, ""Assassnis"" was certainly a step in the right direction. The was some action in the book, not (as in ""Apollyon"") only 200 pages into the book. ""Assassins"" was also not as preachy as for example ""Soul Harvest"".So it's definitely an improvement. There are still problems though. There's still too much filler material and the book could have been about 50 pages shorter (but that's an imporvement from the other books, which should have been about 250 pages shorter). And the story is moving to slowly. I can't understand why they need to stretch it out into so many volumes.2.5/5"
5,Another page turner in an incredible series!,"I was told about this series after the 4th book came out and read the first 4 in 1 week. I read the 5th in 1 day. I read this book (the 6th) in about 6 hours. I could not put it down. The writing is top notch, the suspense builds and builds, and the wait for the next one is too long!! I wanted to drag this one out some but couldn't do it."
5,This book was awesome!!!,"I received this book in the mail on Sat and finished it by Sunday night. I just knew who the assasin was and how it was going to happen. And they left us hanging in suspense. I kept reading those last two pages over and over again. Now we have to wait until spring to find out who. Doesn't matter, he comes back to life. I can't believe we have only one more book to conclude it all."
5,Awesome book series about the coming Revelation!,"As a Christian, this book scares me to death! Not because I will be here, because I won't. It scares me because it outlines the book of Revelation and I fear for the people who do not know our ""Supreme Commander,"" Jesus Christ.This book is a great teaching tool also for some who have a hard time reading and understanding the Book of Revalation. Although it is just a story line you can't discount the ""real"" story line, the Bible. Great book...finished it quickly. I am ready for the next one."
1,"Were the collateral damage not so severe, they'd be revised.","Even a cursory analysis of the characterization and plot devices of this volume indicates a general decline in the overall qualitative effect of the series. Most readers are no longer gripped by the minutiae of the Israeli conflagration, nor are the impending catastrophes presented with plausibility or satisfactory allocation of pagination. Major events are dealt with in a summarily dismissive manner, and minor characters consume far too much dialogue space. A more credible reading of the eschatological importment would provide far more casualties and more attention to such details as food and water and other such life sustaining materiel. In short, the heavily perfunctory and homiletic approach of the authors prevents literary and theological appreciation from taking place to any major extent."
1,great idea - awful writing,"I'm a Chrisian and give ""Left Behind"" away all the time. But the series is getting so drawn out, I wish someone would write ""The Unauthorized Conclusion to Left Behind,"" and we could be done with it. People die for no reason that I can discern, (ohter than the author doesn't have a place for them), the boy/girl stuff is juvenile ""does he really like me? then why did he say that?"", and the irrevelant detail is nauseating: ""R. took a walk. His phone rang. It was B. B. said, how are you? R. said, fine why did you call. B. said, no reason, I was just thinking about you...."" PLEASE STOP RIPPING OFF A LOYAL READERSHIP AND GET ON WITH IT.... Thanks and God Bless"
3,In The Begining,There were two christen men. They decided to tell a adventurous storey. On a biblical scale. This storey attracted christens and non-christens alike. Two christens that had an idea and a wonderful plan. Now however somewhere along the lines it has turned into two capitalist men adding more and more ...books to keep us buying and buying. As I write this book 9 is coming out. If I purchase all copys of these I am at $... Book 8 only spand a few days in the 7 year period of the trib. My guess is that these books will go on longer then the 7 years of revalations.
4,GREAT JOB GUYS! I LOVED IT!,"Keep on writing, it's going great! I love the way the story is going. I can't wait for the next one.Anyone looking for something great to read while they're waiting for the next LaHaye book, I would highly recommend (THE FIST OF GOD) by A.T. Nicholas. One of the best spiritual thrillers that I have ever read! Good vs evil at it's best. Nicholas has a bright future."
5,Will leave you wanting more!,"Hattie has disappeared, leaving tribulation members wondering about her outcome and theirs. The tribulation force has lost yet another member while others join in their cause. The 6th trumpet judgement has begun bringing with it horsemen engaged in a bloody battle. As a gathering of dignitaries and followers gets under way tensions rise while cheers grow louder.As the novel spirals to a climactic conclusion the reader is thrust into the next volume in the series. This particular book will leave you wanting more. Excellent character and scene, as the previous books in the series have been thus far, and has left me satisfied with the time invested in reading this volume. Very well written. I look forward to the next book and reconnecting with my favorite characters."
2,Kind of a let down.,I was on a left behind high for so long. I read all of the previous books within days. Here I am now on Assasins and I am going on week two of reading it. It isn't nearly the page turner the one written before were. It may be because Lahaye Jenkins and I have such a difference to how we take revelations. Everything is soooo literal with them. I mean so literal it can almost be a bit corny and ridiculous. I will continue on with the series and hopefully soon be done with this assasins so I can move on. Also another thing I don't like is that it seems every character feels no fear. Its quite unbelivable and unrelateable if they never once are afraid especially in a time like that.
4,Whodunit,"This book begins with a Christian character desiring to be the one to murder the Anti-Christ. Is that ironic? Is it okay for a follower of Christ to want to murder?Assassins is a quick-paced novel leading up to the assassination of the Anti-Christ. It's one of those whodunit stories where the culprit may surprise you.This was a fun endeavor for the Jenkins/LaHaye team (Seriously, what input does Timmy have here). I enjoyed trying to figure out who the killer was. I love how this book ends: ""we know who our assassin is."" ""We sure do."" End book.It's a terrific cliff hanger.After the story, you get ""The Truth Behind the Fiction"": added content describing how prophecy is being fulfilled in this era. Of course, all of this new information comes from their own prophecy newsletter so it's going to be heavily biased.This book was provided for review, at no cost, by Tyndale Publishing."
1,Sizzle and No Steak,This was a disappointing continuation of the series. There were a lot of cliffhanger chapters that were underwhelmingly resolved. LaHaye and Jenkins are milking an interesting premise for all it's worth!
1,BORING - Take a PASS!,I got 1/2 way through and left it on the airplane. I have *never* not finished a book before. I would give this one a pass
2,They made Rayford into a doofus.,"I don't know what the authors were thinking, but this book's characterization of Rayford is pathetic. There's no real sense of continuity with the previous books; this Rayford comes across as demented, unbalanced, vengeful and sometimes just plain old nuts. Sure, the characters are all under stress, but this seems way out of line."
3,"entertaining, but not great writing","I must admit that I enjoy this series. I read Assassins in one day, but the reason for my 3 star rating is that these books are not that well written. They are pulp fiction. Period. And I absolutely hate the romantic sections, they are written like a 12 year old girl would write them."
2,If you can get beyond the hideous anti-Catholicism. . .,". . .based not on what the Church teaches, but what LaHaye and Jenkins have bought into. . .you might find the premise of this book to be a little more thought-provoking than most in this series.At least a legitimate moral question is posed: Is it moral to kill a tyrant? I'll give the authors credit -- a little -- for asking a serious question. But overall, this book -- like the series -- is a poorly written collection of comic book caricatures based on an extreme minority view of ""Last Things"" -- a view rejected, not only by Catholic and Orthodox Christians, but by most Protestants as well.If you're into supernatural thrillers, read Charles Williams. If you're into novels about the ""End Times"" try ""That Hideous Strength"" by C.S. Lewis or ""Father Elijah"" by Michael O'Brien."
1,"Tiresome, repetitive, uninspired, sloppy","On the whole, it might be less irksome to endure the Tribulation than to sit through the remaining volumes in this series. Characterization, never a strong point in this series, has all but been abandoned here. Dialogue is even more wooden than in the previous books. And plotting has been abandoned in favor of happenstance. Only the least critical reader could find anything of substance and style in this volume. With six projected volumes to go, this series will prove the accuracy of Eliot's remark about the world ending in a whimper, not a bang."
3,STILL GOOD; BUT LOT SLOWER THAN THE OTHERS,"I have read all six books and thought this one was a little boring. When I got to the end, I couldn't believe I was through. I buy both the books and the audiotapes. I buy the books for my son who is 23 and my daughter (26) and I listen to the tapes on the way and back from work. I hope the other six will be more exciting. I'd rather have just one more exciting book than six more dull ones. Also, on the audiotapes, please get rid of the music. Makes me a nervous wreck waiting for the book to start. The reader is fantastic--don't ever change him! He's what makes the tapes that much more exciting."
3,Disappointed,"As an eager follower of the series, I was disappointed to read this book. Although it did have some good points, it lacked a lot of that spark that kept you glued. The characters were not as personable.It seemed to lack that quality that kept you wanting to read. Overall, I liked it better when these two great authors take their time writing their books and give the storyline some more thought than this. I was embarrassed actually with some of the lines and felt they were immature. I hope the next book will be back to the ""old"" style of the originals."
5,"EXCELLANT, POWERFUL","All the Left Behind series are compelling and worth everyones attention. The writers bring each of the characters alive, and each story brings you into the hearts and feelings of each character. Each book leaves you ""on the edge of your seat"" waiting for the next book to reach the book stands. These two writers are execellant apart and also together."
5,Excellent!!! Very hard to put down,"This book was so good I had a hard time putting it down, same with the others in this series. I can't wait for number seven and the others to follow. This make what's to come, real. I know the end days wont be exactly like this, but it's sure to be close to this. It makes me want to be prepared...to be right with God. I hope and pray you're all ready too. Read it, it will definately make you think about what's to come. God bless!!!"
4,The best book yet written by Lahaye and Jenkins.,"Very riveting. Assassins is better than Left Behind. Could not stop myself to get to the end. I was up to all hours trying to find out what happens to Ray, Buck, Cloe, and Tsion. I was hoping that this was the end because I didn't want to wait for the next book. Layhaye and Jenkins are some of the best authors I've ever seen. Their writing style is like none other. It's better than some of the most famous authors of the 20th century. Their writing is so clear that you can't help but place yourself in the novel, to be right there with the characters, doing, feeling, and moving with them. It's as if they are right next to you. I hope that they finish the next book soon, or at least have a preview of what it looks like."
3,"Better than Apollyon, but they need to pick up the pace.","The series is a great idea. ""Left Behind"" is a classic. A friend referred to it as a ""mainstream view of revelation,"" which is a pretty good description. I found Apollyon disapppointing, so I was glad to see them get back to the form of the first few books. Still, I must say that I think we deserve more closure in each book if they are going to charge full price. Seems like they are milking it to have 6 more."
2,GE 18556 - F13DBX23T4/SPX35,I bought this to replace a Panasonic light.This replacement bulb works great BUT.... It takes a lot longer to start up.When you turn the light on it flickers and flickers then starts and works great.I did not have this problem with the Panasonic.I only gave this a 2 star because of the annoying flickering
4,Tear Soup,"Books - Tear SoupA warm and comforting analogy for those who grieve the loss of a loved one. Written as a child's book, it speaks to all ages and illustrates the value of our tears."
5,Excellent for all ages.,"""Tear Soup"" is appropriate for children and adults alike. Because a specific loss is not given for the main character, individuals can easily identify with the character and focus on their own source of grief. I've given it to those grieving the loss of a parent, spouse or child as well as for divorce, loss of a beloved pet, and loss of role related to an illness or accident. There is a good, more specific list of resources at the back that can be very helpful. I've given this book more times than I can recall, and the feedback has always been positive. I keep several on hand ""just in case."""
5,"Awesome, awesome, and a million times awesome!","I lost my Dad 7 weeks ago - it was very sudden and completely unexpected. I have been really struggling, as has my 8 yo daughter, so I did some searching for books on grief that may help us both. I actually got this one for my daughter, but think it has helped me just as much, if not more!!It's honest, yet gentle, and helps you realize that the way you grieve will be different than other people - even if you have lost the same person, or the same figure. As a total bonus to the text, the pictures are beautiful and enhance the book's theme immensely.Because the book never explicitly says why Granny is grieving it is fantastic for anyone who is dealing with a loss of any kind."
4,Tear Soup Review,"Excellent book to help children and families cope with grief and loss. As a social worker, I will incorporate it into my clinical practice but in this instance, I am purchasing the book to give as a gift to one of my young clients who recently lost her father.Tear Soup"
4,Tear Soup,This is a good read and such a big help. If one was to give a book to a griving person it should be this onePat Schwiebert didn't leave any thing out in this book she lets a person know it is ok to take as long as you need toget hold of your loss
5,A perfect book for those who are hurting,This book is such a wonderful book describing how grief works differently for each person. I would highly recommend this book for someone who is hurting or grieving. We have all made Tear Soup!
5,Wonderful grief book,"I work as an administrative assistant for a group of ~20 counselors. When I lost my grandmother, this book was given to me by one of them. It seemed at first to be geared toward children with all of the great illustrations, but as I read it, I saw such deep meaning in it. This book was very insightful for me and my children (ages 12 and 10). I now give or recommend it to those around me who are affected by the loss of a loved one."
5,Tear Soup is Wonderful!!,Tear Soup was sent to me by a dear friend after my mother passed. It is an AMAZING book. It brings such comfort and offers help and resources. I ordered one for my daughter and one for a friend. Everyone should have this in their personal library.
5,Tear Soup,"This is an excellent book that helps people of all ages who have lost a loved one. I have been facilitating grief support groups for several years and have used and given this book to many, many people. It's a gentle reminder of why we need to grieve and, best of all, how we can look at this very normal, but very difficult journey in life."
5,"Simple, true, and relevant","This book is appropriate for most all ages. I have yet to use it with any kids in the schools, however, I've read through it a few times and been impressed with the lasting impression it leaves. The book doesn't push any particular ideology of death and afterlife,although it does make reference to god."
5,Tear Soup,Excellent book for anyone of any age going through the grieving process. I really liked having it available to read to my grandson when he asked me why I was crying. I recommend it whenever I can. It does not specifically mention death so it can be read by those who have experienced a loss of any kind.
2,Tear Soup,"After reading all of the wonderful reviews of this book, I was anxious to order it. I wanted it for my 7 yr old son after his grandmother passed away. I was very disappointed with this book. It is written like a childrens book, but my husband & I both felt the book wasn't appropriate for children at all. If you are looking for a book for a grieving child, this one is not it."
4,Very helpful in teaching my son how to deal with his grief.,"This book was very helpful in teaching my son how to deal with his grief over the loss of his grandpa. There were a few parts that I thought were a little too mature for him (he's 9 years old), but for the most part it was a great book."
5,A comfort book & for dealing with loss,Practical guidance for dealing with loss presented in an illustrated story form as though it were a children's book. Charming and helpful with comforting words and advice that helps well past the point when your acquaintances may begin to tire of your grief and mourning. This book gives you permission to grieve and also give you permission and guidance in going on with your life. This is a book for all ages.There is a list of resources in the back for those dealing with different kinds of loss. Though they do not have a resource specifically for people who have lost someone in War they do have a large range of support groups etc.
5,"Thank you, Pat Schweibert...","...for this sensitive and thoughtful book about a topic that most people don't want to - or know how to - face: death. As each death and its impact on us is unique, this book covers the range of emotional responses to death, how to deal with well-meaning, but possibly insensitive comments from others, and it also includes an excellent resource section. I have given the book to over 15 people during their time of suffering and grief - it allows us to talk openly about their pain, and it gives them a comfort object. Thank you again, Pat Schweibert."
5,Really hits the spot,"This book was hard to get through as the content is so sensitive (the death of a loved one) however, I would highly recommend it if this situation applies. I have read it several times and have since passed it on to a family member whom I hope will find it comforting. The resources at the end of the book are great!"
5,Good book. For the young and old.,I gave this book to a friend who's son passed away and she really appreciated it. It is excellent and the illustrations are beautiful. It is a good book for any age- especially for someone that has lost a loved one.
4,Tear Soup,"This was a good book, recommended to me by a friend. It hits home in so many areas of life."
5,Excellent book,Wonderful book for many types of grief...I shared with friend who is walking through the sudden deaths of two grandchildren and friend living with cancer and it's treatments. Great for all ages...beautiful pictures.
3,"not sure at first, but then....","I was not moved at first, I actually was a bit irritated. I walked away from the book thinking that it was a disappointment. After a couple of days, I began to actually absorb the abstract approach and read it again--it is really very good!! I have since given it to my Mother, Sister-in-Law and a few others--worth the try!"
5,Excellent,"Appropriate for all sorts of grief. Could have used double the number I ordered, and will no doubt order more in days to come."
2,"Tear Soup, great graphics and simple yet poignant story.","A somewhat elementary view of the grieving process, but perhaps one that the majority of peopleare Unaware of, therefore, a great eye opener garnering more compassion and patience for many."
5,Thank you for this book!,"This book was given to me as a gift and it was really the perfect thing. For anyone going through loss or a sad time, pass this along! It will mean the world and take them through their darkest days. I think that's the job of books. So I recommend!"
5,Tear Soup,If you are grieving or you know someone who is you should get this book for yourself and for them. It is a life saver.
5,It Tells It All!,"After the death of my beloved husband, I read a number of books on the topic of grief. This book was the best. It tells the reader in a succinct manner the healthy way to go through the grieving process. The book is good for all ages (including children). I have bought a number of copies and now give it to any close family member of friend who goes through a major loss in his/her life."
5,Grief Support,"This book is just wonderful. It looks like it is just for children but really it is for everyone. It has beautiful illustrations and most important, it tells about the grieving process when we lose someone we love. There is very helpful information in this book and I would recommend it to anyone who dealing with grief."
5,This is a wonderful book.,This is a wonderful book. I have given several copies away to friends and family who are grieving. It encompasses many types of loss and allows and encourages the wounded person to grieve in their own manner at their own pace. The art is amazing. The text is freeing. The resources in the back are very helpful. I recommend this book highly and send my heartfelt sympathy to all who need its comfort.
2,Not sure what I think of this one,"This book was given to me recently when my 4 year old son died. It looks like a children's book, so I read it to my two 7 year old's. But I don't think it is written for children. It's much too heavy for them to comprehend. And yet, it's a story book, and not likely something adults are going to want to pick up. (I even thought about donating it to the public library, but they would most likely stick it in the children's section, and I don't think it belongs there.) And the book goes on far too long. It kind of drags and you wonder when you're ever going to finish it. It took far too many pages just to say that everyone's grief is different. It really didn't help me with my grief at all."
5,What a comfort this book is!,"I first read this book after my husband passed away - Itmade me cry but it was a great comfort.I read it over and over and each time I tooksomething different away from the comfort of thewords.It still makes me cry, but it is a good cry.I have purchased a numberof these booksto give to others who have lost their mate.I have had many thanks for the comfort thatit gives, which makes me thankful all over again.Please consider reading it and giving itto someone else - it will make them feel better and itwill make you feel better, too."
5,A beautiful gift for those who grieve,"I heard about this book from a nurse who learned of the passing of my firstborn baby. I have since ordered twelve, and have given them to people who are traveling own their path of grief as a way to honor my son's memory. It's a beautiful book and timely even when the loss is no longer recent. It addresses the many stages of grief and how there is no one ""right"" way to grieve. The ilustrations enhance the message in a very touching way."
5,a wonderful gift for grieving friends,"The illustrations of this book are beautiful and poignant. The amazing text creates a story that allows any reader to readily identify with the everyday scenrios that happen to the character who has experienced a loss, including well meaning friends and family.highly recommended"
4,Tear Soup,"Those who have walked through the death of a loved one know that this jouney is unpredictable and very difficult! This book make it ok for grieving to look different from one person to the next. Tear Soup acknowledges various aspects of the grieving process with candor, gentle humor and excellent graphics. Although the book graphic feature an older couple,its message spans to youth and young adults as well. The family dog adds a connecting touch to younger generations. I have given this book as a condolence gift to families who have experienced grief. It has a life beyond a fresh bouquet of flowers, as it is offers understanding and opportunity to grieve in accordance to ones own timing. Special appreciation to all who help to create this wonderful resource for those in deepest despair."
5,Excellent approach to grieving for families,"Tear soup is a wonderfully illustrated children's book for adults written about how we each individually grieve loss in our lives.The story is about ""Grandy,"" but she could just as easily be me or you, and Grandy has suffered a loss, so Grandy begins to make tear soup. Tear soup cannot be made just out of a can, but is an individual process, as unique as each chef; and only through the soup making can we fully heal and move on.The full page illustrations through which the text of the story run show an even richer tale of the other people and pets in Grandy's life who interact with her recipe and add a powerful depth to an already touching story which you can't help but relate to your own life."
3,Condesending?,"Hmmm, I think it's one of those things where, depending on circumstances, it won't be to everyones taste. Parts are condesending I feel, but, you can associate with a lot of what is said in the book. My father in law died a few months ago, and although quite strong at first, my Mother in law has now been hit with the full force of losing her devoted husband. I hoped that reading this book may help her see that how she is feeling is normal, and not to beat herself up, just go with it. So it was for the whole family....some (younger people) didn't get it at all, others did....me? bits suits and others don't. Worth hanging onto and reading it over again....."
1,Feh,Poor dog!What a not uplifting and inappropriately age skewed book this was.It did not help me in my grief and needed heavy editing to be read to children.Feh.
5,Wonderful buy,Really love this book and it came in great condition. Very happy with the quick efficient service. Thank you.
4,grief,This book helps in understanding the grieving process. It is written in clear thought-provoking language. The illustrations are excellent.
3,2 sides,"I use this switch at work, and it functions wonderfully. It is very small, never needs new batteries or anything like that, and a quick keyboad combination automatically changes computers.At home, I ran into a very different problem because I use a wireless keyboard and mouse. Although the connection is correct, neither my keyboad or mouse will work. I origionally wanted it as an easy way to use my laptop and desktop at home, but it is not as convient as I was hoping.However, I can't stress enough that if you have a normal keyboard/mouse, this switch will work just fine."
3,General Blue: Underwater Hunt,"This video contains 4 episodes from the popular anime seriesDragon Ball (no Z). They are: 46.BULMA'S BAD DAY, 47.KAME HOUSE-FOUND!, 48.DEEP SEA BLUE, 49.ROSHI SURPRISE.It is a good video."
3,General Blue Underwater Hunt,General Blue Underwater Hunt Is a cool video from the popular Dragonball Series. It includes 4 exciting episodes. General blue is the 3rd highest man in the Red Ribbin Army. The video includes General Blue and his men chasing Goku and friends underwater then they crah land in a Pirate Cave. Its a good video.
4,"Funny, but not what I expected...","This was a funny movie and I still watch it, but I think I had different expectations of the movie. I enjoyed it though and it was very funny. Come on, Mike Epps and Ice Cube, means FUNNY!"
2,Ice and Comedy No!!!! He really should stick to more family orientated stuff.,I loved iced cube back when he was with NWA but he really can't do comedy like he use to. He's more of a diverse father figure type now a day's....Now Mike Epps is funny cause he get's hype over little things.
4,Best movie to come out in 2009,"These two together always equal good entertainment. You will never be disappointed with this one because it surely is Janky Entertainment. Mike Epps, IceCube, young jezzy, and many more hilarious characters you have to watch this movie to see what Im talking about."
3,Buyer Beware.....,"While this film is watchable, I definitely would rate this as the least liked of the corroborations between Cube and Mike Epps. I would also say it falls towards the bottom when you throw in the Friday series, and the other movies he's played a hand in creating. As a big Cube fan, musically and theatrically, this is hands-down one of his worst (which explains why it was never advertised before being released to the theater, and then quickly released to DVD). It has its moments, but those expecting the same quality of work will be disappointed."
5,!!!Fast,"i received the movie yesterday.. It had only been a few days since i put in the order. the only thing i didnt like was the fact that a tracking number was not given. the movie was in original packaging, i havent watched it yet though. thanks! will order again."
2,ok movie,"i like ice cube but, this movie was not the greatest as i thought could of been better , ?No wonder i did not hear about this movie lol"
2,"Led Zepplin, the song isn't the same","OK, so the songs are the same but I was disappointed in the HD DVD. I got to see Zepplin in concert at about the same time this concert was recorded and have listened to cds ever since. Sound quality wasn't that good neither was picture quality. I think the stuff in the beginning of the dvd just really confused me and I couldn't get into it that much from then on."
3,Great show but the packaging is very poor,"The two DVDs are great, the extras are a nice surprise and the gadgets are very good, but the packaging is very poor.The box material is too light and arrived with many damages, the gadgets are mixed togheter without any order and the free poster offer only for US is quite disappointing for an European fan.I would have paid more for a better packaging without any doubt."
3,"Great, but NOT AS ADVERTISED","For those of you who may be wondering, this set DOES NOT come with the soundtrack CD. That was the only reason I popped for the collector's edition over the regular package.As others have said, the t-shirt is more of a medium than an XL.I was also disappointed to discover that the new songs are on the bonus disc, not integrated into the main film.At the end of the day, it's Zeppelin and it looks and sounds great, but the exclusion of the soundtrack CD makes for a bit of false advertising. Buyer beware."
3,Better off with the 2003 set,"Every so often, I get an urge to rent this movie...and as hard as I try, I can help but nod off during ""Dazed and Confused"". I used to feel ashamed...and then I'd be talking to people and I realized I wasn't alone!There are some truly great moments in this show (""Since I've Been Loving You"" and ""No Quarter"" among others), but the poor camera work (very choppy and WAY too much time pointed at Plant's crotch), the dream sequences and the more ""mainstream"" song selection make this one a yawn-fest.THANK GOD for the new Zeppelin set! A version of Dazed and Confused recorded when they were still interested in playing it!!Much better than the version here.This one is for avid, die-hards only. If you want quality and more album cuts, get the new one...."
2,good picture bad sound,the picture is great of course is blue ray but the sound at least the one i got sounds horrible
4,"Great movie, weird beginning.","Great movie if you are a fan of Led Zeppelin. Even if you are not, it is still cool. The performance is awesome. Watching some of Jimmy Paige's guitar solos left me breathless. Watching his hand move up and down the neck of the guitar was amazing. Great vocals, and John Bonhams drum solo is insane.The only thing is the beginning is kind of strange. Was sort of hard to understand what was up with it and what they were trying to accomplish in the beginning until I read a book about Led Zeppelin and saw what they were trying to do. Besides the beginning, a great movie."
4,Good but not great,"When I bought this Led-Zeppelin DVD, I was hoping for alot more of them live, then those stupid fantasy settings. The quality...on DVD is awsome, so is the sound. When they show concert fotage, its just unreal. I with there was more special features and less fantasy stuff. Other than that, its a great DVD"
3,Stairway to Heaven,"Zep still pack a punch 30 years on. The best part of this DVD is the live performances, the songs from Houses of the Holy sound better now than they seemed to then, particularly the Rain song and No Quarter. Unfortunately the fantasy sequences now seem pure Spinal Tap, but ok, it was the seventies. The lengthy Dazed and Confused is total excess and Whole Lotta Love sloppy. One poignant moment in the intro to Stairway to Heaven when the camera shows the New York skyline and the Twin Towers...Good reissue even with poor sound."
4,Blu-Ray 1080i Transfer,"Their are plenty of reviews discussing the content of the film / concert. My review is specifically intended to address the transfer of this film to Blu-Ray. The source signal (at least on my copy) indicates a 1080i transfer (not 1080p). Still, this is the best available version of this package to date. Film is grainy in outdoor sequences, however concert footage is more than acceptable when considering the source material is over 30 years old. Purchased this copy over the Best Buy website in December '07. As other reviewers point out, it has since been discontinued in this particualar format and re-release timing TBD."
4,No booklet??,"The movie was great! I have the previous dvd version, and the sound on this is much improved! The sound is amazing, and the picture is clearer and the colors brighter also. The extras on disc 2 are excellent and well worth purchasing this even if you already have another version. The interviews are good, but the extra songs and performances are fantastic! The film editing on the songs jumps around alot though and sometimes makes me wonder if I am actually watching the performance of that song or film of other performance edited to look like it is that song they are playing, it's hard to tell. But overall it is excellent!!My reason for only giving 4 stars is due to the disapointment of opening the dvd and seeing no booklet. No slip or table of contents or picture or anything. Just the 2 dvds in the case. No booklet?? That was surprising and disapointing. Guess they're really trying to make people shell out more for the collector's box."
4,It's good but I think the re-editors had their hands tied,"I guess the owner of the film told them they could clean up the sound and image but couldn't recut. So the song outtake have to ""remains the same."" And it's shot in 73 so don't expect it to look like the Matrix even if the HD does look better. It's still a very cool show and worth the $15 I paid for it."
1,Emabarassing remains the same unfortunately,"Here's the format i would have shelled out money for: The whole concert footage, sans fantasy sequences, disc one; the fantasy sequences alone on side two just for period piece/comedy value. I can't believe the band even wants people to have to sit through this stuff any more. Even The Clash's terrible ""Rude Boy"" movie had an option on the DVD menu whereby you could just watch the great live scenes. Maybe they'll trot the fantasy-less version out next Christmas...!"
2,INTERMINABLE,"I bought a CD some time back called Encomium, which was a compilation of tributes to Led Zeppelin's music. I heard it once, barely scraping to the last number.The nauseating monotony of that supposedly iconic anthology is on display in this drone of a DVD as well. Jimmy Page whooshes, Bob Plant moans, JPJ tinkers around with jazz-like riffs, and Bonham squeak-shrieks for about quarter of an hour, followed by about five minutes of audience cheers, of which you wouldnt want to miss a second, would you.Video-wise, during these shrieks we see dawdly 'fantasy' sequences, with some backstage interludes, where we get to see their acrimonious manager trying on his backend ""hip"" and gleefully abusing stadium employees.Not my definition of a ""documentary"". Not my definition of anything else either for that matter, with the possible exception of Stairway to Heaven."
1,Led Zeppelin - Some of the best blues-rock. Video - Boring.,"For some, just the shot at seeing the band play must be a thrill. I loved L.Z. album I, most of II and IV, some from V, and a few cuts from the other albums. (I have the Complete Studio Recordings set. I want to get the BBC set!) I still consider some of their song renditions the best in blues-rock.A fan of the songs, I never followed the band. I never followed any band. Didn't point my finger to the sky to say #1. (I considered them the best rock band that I knew of at the time, ages 12-18, but it was the MUSIC.)I didn't like the live sound on their album (heard at about age 17) or on the video (seen at 37). Frankly, I found the video boring. So, my * vote is for the video, not for the music, and not for the band.Now if only someone had spotted some of the music on the albums to the video....(C) 1999. Rights shared with Amazon.com (for 1999 anyway)."
2,Midnight at the Movies,"I must have seen this movie 20 times at the local theatre. Friday and Saturday nights at midnight they'd play Rock n Roll movies. I have never been able to stay awake through the whole movie. I thought at the time it was because we were staying up past midnight to watch it and we were just to tired to make it to the end. So when I picked up the DVD and brought it home after not seeing it for so many years I thought ""I'm finally gonna be able to see this movie from start to finish"". I still fell asleep. This movie has not aged well. I LOVE ZEP. But this movie reminds me too much of Spinal Tap. The dream sequences.........Why are the there? The band looks very bored. They also seem to take this whole 'rock star' persona way to seriously. Spinal Tap was a spoof. This was not and looks like one. Long live Zep...........but you don't need this DVD in your collection."
3,The Song Remains the Same (Collector's Edition),"The Extra's are very cool but I wished they had mixed the DVD to include the actual performance or the order of the newly released CD version of The Song Remains the Same but none the less Led Zeppelin will forever deliver the goods I just hope they record with Jason to extend their mark in the music world. What other band could pull off the comeback album of a lifetime? Really who else could say that they have another number one album after 29 years later of not releasing any new music "" I don't count CODA because it was stuff that was in vaults. I also commend Led Zeppelin for being faithful to the fallen member for this many years but just send us fans some new material or at least a bunch of old songs that were left on cutting room floor such as Jennings Farm Blues or the Acoustic Version Of Black Dog I know it's out there!!!!!"
4,Essential purchase for any Zeppelin fan,"For the longest time if you were a Zeppelin fan this was your only chance to catch a glimpse of them live, and even then you had to wait to see it at a midnight movie.OK, I'm showing my age and I know I'm being a little nostalgic. Sure, the fantasy sequences are a little cheesy and even then, we noticed that sometimes Jimmy's hand's weren't syncing up quite right with the music but it didn't matter, this was Zeppelin live! Anyway, they've remastered the soundtrack, the picture looks a lot better and the second disc of extra footage makes it essential. If you're a fan, you either have it already or you need this."
2,depressing,"really a downer. depressing. bad blues. After viewing this, I feel dark and gloomy.If it had been in a theater, I would have walked out of the darkness as soon as possible.Life is so much brighter than this stuff."
3,Please!!!,"I would like to address nmollo from London.(I assume England) ""Obscure rock band from the 70's."" That is very funny. Sarcasm is tantamount to treason if you bad mouth Zeppelin in the U.S.A. Anyway, The Song Remains the Same will be available on a two-disc DVD in November, I hear. Preorder your copy today!"
3,No Original Surround Mix! Get this title from Amazon UK,"I got this title from Amazon UK for about $35. See last post for link.Hope this helps...Old Revoew:I am a big fan of Led Zeppelin having seen them live in 1977 a year after this film was released. We'll have to wait and see what the final audio on these Discs contain, but if it only has a regular Dolby Digital 5.1 mix, then Led Zep has blown it again IMO. I still own the original VHS, Betamax and DVD versions, and those are stereo, certainly Not the great discrete aggressive surround sound mix I remember hearing in 1976 at the theater. I remember in the theatrical version with the proper speaker set-up Jimmy Page's guitar feedback bouncing back and forth throughout the front and rear speakers along with Robert Plant's vocals on ""Dazed And Confused."" Totally awesome. That original theatrical mix is one of the ""holy grail"" Quad/surround mixes from the 1970's and it looks like we're never going to be able to hear it again."
1,Zeppelin at their worst,"I've been a fan since I saw them in concert in 1970. Their first four albums are classics. When this film first came out, I couldn't wait to see it in the theaters. I've only seen it once, and I thought the concert performances were HORRIBLE! So bad, in fact, I couldn't listen to LZ for a decade! Every time I heard their music, images of these god-awful performances filled my mind. I finally re-kindled my love for their music, and I never want to see this film again. If you really want the definitive dvd of this band, buy the 2 disc compilation ""Led Zeppelin."" It is STUNNING from beginning to end, and shows the band in all their glory. Why they ever released these poor performances, when they had the great performances shown in ""Led Zeppelin,"" mystifies me."
2,Audio not synchronized with the video.,Video is very much delayed with the audio that even my high-end full featured AVR is unable to synchronize them. What a disappointment!
2,How to ruin the vision for all time.,"Have they separated the ""dream sequences"" from the middle of the songs?If they did, this will become one of the greatest concert films ever.If not, toss it in the trash can as some of the most embarrassing, boring statements ever.#1 kick A$$ band of all times.Having seen Zeppelin in the 70's more then a few times.Also going to see this when it first came out and watching people walk out in groups.Let you all know the original generation of fans were not pleased.Don't let the retrospective pushers make you believe this was the real deal.Even during the ""midnight"" showings in the theaters. Most went outside to have a beer, or smoke a joint.Or stay inside and sleep.After all it is Led Zeppelin, and it's true their worst was still better then most everybody else's best.Get the Zeppelin DVD if you want something close to the real deal."
1,The Songs Doesn't Remain The Same . . .,"Some audio expresions from Robert Plant are missing on this dvd versionI notice that almost at the end of ""The Song Remains The Same"" track you don't hear a ""come on, here we go"" compared to the vhs, also at the middle of ""Stairway to Heaven"" there is another missing vocal bit when Robert repeats ""wait a minute"" for the second time...Even at the end of the same track you can't find another line.If you look for these discrepancies you will be amazed of how people dare to CHANGE MUSIC HISTORY during a remasterization process.No one has the right to do that... I guess after all,THE SONG DOESN'T REMAIN THE SAME."
3,Not Zep at their best,"I will buy this, but it's definitely *not* Led Zeppelin at their best. The 2-DVD Led Zeppelin set that came out a couple of years ago is much better, this performance from Madison Square Garden (with soundstage footage cut in to make it appear live) is really just an average performance by the band. But with that said, officially released Led Zep footage is rare, so I'll pick it up for that reason alone."
3,No soundtrack included,"The description of the collector's edition on the Led Zeppelin site and on the back of the box indicates that a remastered soundtrack is included. - it's not. The T-shirt has that annoying ""distressed"" look and is nothing special. The cards included are also nothing special. Just get the regular remastered DVD. You'll still have to buy the soundtrack, but so will I."
2,for the curious only.,"The sound is poor as it prologic and very centre channel,the video is hacked up and out of synch with the energy on stage, the off stage sequences are rediculous and unnecessary But it is Led Zep and therefore good to watch Page at work. Bonham is an animal, I think Keith Moon would have gotten out of breath trying to keep up on the skins. I think the camera work spent too much time on Plant below the belt and we would have all been served better above the waist."
4,It's Zepplin! Need I say more?,"The classic ""The Song Remains the Same"" finally made it's way to Blu-ray. I couldn't be happier. The audio portion of this film has been greatly upgraded and sounds amazing. The video portion looks a hell of a lot better than the old VHS copy of this film I was watching it on. It looks great. There is only so much you can do with the old video footage but in no way does it look degraded at all. Maybe a little better than a new VHS copy. Seriously though, it's Zepplin! Need I say more?"
2,Good but Flawed movie with poor packaging,"Let me start off by saying the 2 Stars I've given to this are not for the movie content, but rather the very poor packaging for what is supposed to be deluxe LTD Edition. Similar packages by the Dylan, The Doors, U2 and others all have top quality content in both music & packaging with hard case boxes, this set on the other hand is made of the most flimsy box they could find & is basically not what you'd expect from Zep who supposedly pride themselves on quality. So the Verdict is save money & buy the standard edition which I award 4 stars, the Ltd Edition packaging on the other hand gets 1 star."
5,I Sit Stupifyed,"You know a band is good when they can go on stage and come out with better versions of songs than the studio versions. That's exactly what Zeppelin does in The Song Remains the Same, and if you have any question of their talent, I urge you to watch the introduction of Since I've Been Loving You, in which they zoom in on Page's fingers during an incredible solo. Incredible. Then watch the 1/2 hour version of Dazed and Confused, including Page's bow trick which makes the most unbelievable sound come out of the guitar. Just watch the whole thing. You wont be sorry."
3,"The band was right, it was an off night","As a collector of Zeppelin live shows, it is disappointing that the only official chronicle of one of the 3 greatest live bands of the '70s (Zep, Floyd, WHO...honorable mention to the Stones) was from the ill fated Houses of the Holy tour. Maybe Jimmy will finally do us all justice and finally release both a cd and video anthology of the vast amount of high quality live Zeppelin material. Until then, this is what we have........"
3,Not a great effort,"Led Zeppelin concert footage is like pizza; even when its bad its good. Would be much better if the were more songs and less theatrical nonsense. Also, the soundtrack is horrible. Certainly doesn't do them jsutice. Still one of my top 5 all time bands."
3,Proof that drugs cause brain damage,"The concert footage, while not featuring Zep at their peak, is a must have for any fan. But the fantasy sequences and faked back stage scenes are at best annoying interuptions of the real show."

2,Song remains the same 2 disc special edition,"Save your money! It is cleaner looking and sounding.That is about as much good as I can say about it! Why didn't Jimmy Page just put some more footage together and include a show from MSG and call it Led Zeppelin DVD II? All this rubbish about copyrights and such. Just don't call it ""song remains the same"" and get rid of those tired fantasy sequences and let us see the band performing.I am a little disappointed in Jimmy this time and I am not alone.I am one of their biggest fans for over 32yrs. We waited a long time for new footage.I think we deserved more! Perhaps,one day,we wil get the shows uncut and void of ""fantasy""!"
2,"Led Zeppelin rocks, this DVD does not","During the 70's Led Zeppelin were the kings of rock, not only that, but they put on a good show. Now I'm a huge Zeppelin fan, so when I give it 2 stars, you know it sucks. When I purchased this DVD I frankly expected more. I (being a guitarist) expected to see Jimmy Page in all his glory thrashing out riffs for everybody. Instead, i get Jimmy playing at his sloppiest. Robert Plant keeps saying ""push, push"" during every song which is, quite frankly, disturbing. John Paul Jones and John Bonham sound great, but stand behind Robert and Jimmy like statues (which I guess is okay). Robert, Jimmy, John, and JPJ all look tired and worn out. To put it, they look lazy. Add to this the annoying ""dream sequences"" and there you have it. I expected a Zeppelin concert, not a freaky LSD trip."
2,Misleading,This was not at all what some other reviewers described it to be. Just an okay disc in very cheap packaging.
2,Page mistakes + bad editing = Mess,"OK,OK I admit it..I am a typical American male in my 30's and went to see this 942 times at midnight showings in the 70's.But nostalgia aside,the band just weren't on this(these)nights. Couple this with horrific editing and MANY scenes reshot on a soundstage makes for a trying experience.What makes this an absolute disaster is that I STILL prefer Zep to any of the garbage that I hear/see now....Ahh progress!"
2,thought there would be more,"i thought i was getting the DVD I've seen on VH1 Classis as ""The Song Remains The Same Reissiue''with new footageof Zeppelin doing different gigs than Madison Square Garden but it's just the same movie thatthey put out in 1975 and bashed it saying they didn't even see it before it was released but I learned later they lied (a Led Zeppelin tradition like ripping off other musicians and calling it their own) at least song writers have zep to thank for more strict copywrite laws"
3,Best band ever,"The film is amazing, Led Zeppelin is without a doubt one of the best bands everrrrrr..NOW the product was a big dissapointment, the package and cover suck, I got it faster than I thought and thats a big plus but on the back of the blu-ray it looks like if it was forced into the box or hit against something :/ a bummer since it was a present for someone, I hope they like it."
5,Led Zeppelin Rocks!!!,"I had seen this a long time ago on TV, but as others was not impressed.....This version is much better. I am glad I purchased it for another run....it was worth it."
2,ok,This is certainly good by the high standards of hard rock. There are interruptions in the concert footage which I believe is unnecessary. I'm no fan of Deep Purple but I have to say its Machine Head video is the best video ever. I'm a great fan of progressive bands and this video is still considered a disappointment
1,"Should be called ""The Dong Remains The Same""","I never liked this film. Plainly and simply put, it's terrible. Zep was never much of a live band, their best work was from the studio and Jimmy Page's technical genius."
4,The correct review,"I purchased this at a different location than from Amazon and found it to be in better condition than the first review provided. His claim that the case is cheap is not entirely true. The T-shirt did need to be placed with it, but the rest of it has containers for both the DVD/CD and for all the bonus material. You can seperate them and keep them together if done properly. Just Bill must have torn the whole thing apart if he had to put the DVD/CD in a sleeve to protect them. It has cases for everything which is inside a box (container) Worth the purchase if you want to see the extra footage/music that is inside of it."
3,"Not Zeppelin at their best, but still good...","Robert Plant and Jimmy Page were always somewhat disappointed with The Song Remains the Same, and it's not hard to see why...Some choppy and grainy video, not the highest-fidelity sound and certainly not one of their best live performances. But still, even Led Zep in a mediocre format is still 10 times better than just about anybody else out there. This is a also a great disc for younger Zeppelin fans to get a sense of what this band was like, including how crazy-huge they were, in their day.I actually like the cheesy shorts in this movie. It fits the mood of the time to a T, and they are funny besides."
4,"Good set, but......","I've always loved this movie, but the main problem I have with this new release is that the 4 previously unseen songs (Celebration Day, Over The Hills and Far Away, Misty Mountain Hop, and The Ocean) are not part of the movie at all! WTH? The first disc is the original theatrical release and the second disc is the bonus features including the 4 songs. I was under the impression they had been integrated into the concert and we would finally get to see the show the way it actually happened! Just for that I'll give it 4 stars instead of 5. Why couldn't they recut it and put the songs in the right place?"
1,The Songs Doesn't Remain The Same . . .,"Some audio expresions from Robert Plant are missing on this dvd versionI notice that almost at the end of ""The Song Remains The Same"" track you don't hear a ""come on, here we go"" compared to the vhs, also at the middle of ""Stairway to Heaven"" there is another missing vocal bit when Robert repeats ""wait a minute"" for the second time...Even at the end of the same track you can't find another line.If you look for these discrepancies you will be amazed of how people dare to CHANGE MUSIC HISTORY during a remasterization process.No one has the right to do that... I guess after all,THE SONG DOESN'T REMAINS THE SAME."
2,Disappointing,"I use to be a big fan back in the day, and I recall enjoying this video a lot. Many years later, I am not quite so enthralled as I once was. Most of Page's solos are pretty sloppy IMHO, and Plant is off quite a bit as well. Some decent performances (Moby Dick is probably the best), but most are mediocore. As for the dream sequences, a bit goofy, but not that bad. Some interesting footage worked in as well. Worth a look if your a fan, but I would prefer to see a better performance from these guys."
4,Why the fantasy sequences??? FYI,"Alot of people complain about the cheesy fantasy sequences in the ""Song Remains the Same."" There is a reason for that. I just finished reading the book ""Night and Shade"" a book of interviews with Jimmy Page and others. In the book, Mr. Page goes into detail about the making of the film. Apparently they fired the first director of the movie. There was much footage lost during the making of the film. The finished product had a lot of gaps in it. So, the band decided to fill in the gaps with those fantasy sequences which were done years later. Another interesting tidbit: They had to redo some of the songs on a sound stage. Jimmy Page said he had a little difficulty synching up to his own stuff. I think only a guitarist would notice that some of the songs aren't quite sync'd up. I remember seeing this movie when it first came out in the theaters. After that, I would dream about being a rock star like Jimmy Page!"
3,dated,I thought this concert was kind of long. It was probably one of the best concerts back in the day but you would have had to be stoned. It was lacking something today.
5,great concert,Watching this was easy like going down memory lane. I wish that it would have just been the concert without all the other stuff going on but still a great dvd
2,Great MOvie,"So why the two stares? Because this version of the movie supposedly came with previously unreleased material. Which is just not true! Perhaps the two disc version has this supposed material. But this DVD certainly did not. As a Zeppelin maniac, I have seen this movie hundreds of times. And this movie, while in blu ray, doesn't have a single moment which the regular DVD doesn't have. Now that Celebration Day has been released... I would have Zeppelin Fans consider that option instead."
4,SICKTASTIC,this movie is thight if your a zep fan like me. one bad thing is the weird little movie things they show in the middle of the songs. A really cool thing is the scenes behind the stage. there is some cool stuff. i totally recomend it though!!! it captures tru zeppelin though
4,ball-ping but no sledgehammer,the movie fails in perfection because they showcase a mediocre concert by their standards and their fans. whereas the mood and settings protrayed thru out the video are definitely classic LEPPELIN
5,BECOME A BELIEVER,"ANYONE HEARD ""DEAD ZEPPELIN?"" DREAM ON!!! JUST WATCH THIS FLICK AND ADD ZEPP TO YOUR FAVORITES. EACH MEMBER IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST AT WHAT THEY DO. REMEMBER, THIS WAS 1973, THESE DUDES WERE AHEAD OF MOST ANYONE TODAY. MAYBE NOT AT THEIR BEST? MY EYE!!! THESE GUYS WERE AT THE END OF A LONG TOUR AND THIS WAS THEIR PERFORNANCE, THEY GAVE THEIR BEST, AND NOT TOO MANY TODAY CAN COMPARE. I'M A 300+ VIEWER MINIMUM AND I'LL NEVER TIRE OF THIS POWERFUL BAND! BONZO WILL LIVE FOR EVER!!! ALL YOU YOUNGSTERS OUT THERE, PREPARE FOR A TREAT AND LET'S ALL GIVE THANKS TO THE ZEPPELIN GOD FOR THIS ONE OF FEW GLIMPSES OF ROCK&ROLLS GREATEST BAND EVER!!!!!"
4,Hammer of the Who?,"I saw this movie when it was released in the 70's and I was flying a bit like a kite that day. When I saw last week I wished I was 20 again with that same good stuff floating in my veins. Technically movie is a bit flawed, but other than The Who there is/was no greater band."
2,a MIXED review,"I agree that both the audio and visual aspects of this film must be reviewed. I regret getting the album first. Page and Plant, who are geniuses in the studio, are showboats onstage. If you ask me, they may look cool during masterpieces like ""No Quarter"" and ""Stairway To Heaven"", but they sound either half-dead, or stoned to me. There stage presence, however, as well as many more songs and visuals, make the movie superior to the album, by far. All and all, however, the fantasy scenes, and occasional camera tricks are way, way, way too outdated to do any justice to the feeling Led Zepplin's music gives me. Time limits simply don't apply to them. this is my review of the film, and being a fan of the band, i can still stomach the film."
4,An old gem,This replacement of an old gem was a welcome addition to my Zeppelin collection. I know I owned this many years ago but there are a few gaps in the memory over those years lol. Enjoy
3,collector's edition Led Zeplin,"The movie is great, but the additional items are not so good as to warrent the additional charge. Stick with the movie only if you're interested in this item."
1,Unleded Zeppelin,"Led Zeppelin is my favorite band, however, this movie was horrible. Plot needs major work and the sound quality was not the best (my vinyl LP's are almost better). I would say just buy the soundtrack on CD and you will enjoy it better. Don't buy this DVD just because it is Led Zeppelin, like I did. It's not worth it."
2,"Get ""Spinal Tap"" instead, much funnier","This is a bloated, self-indulgent, boring mess. When this film came out, I remember thinking that if thisis the great Led Zeppelin, then they are quite overrated. Some of the songs are way too long, the videosequences are almost laughable and Plant is either having a bad night or is already struggling to be thePlant of a few years earlier. Get the excellent double DVD ""Led Zeppelin"" instead - way, way better.It not only shows the band at various points in their fairly brief history but does indeed demonstatewhat a terrific group they actually were. In its wake, ""Song"" is now useless."
2,Major sound defect mars otherwise great Blu-ray concert.,"Unfortunately the Blu-ray version of this concert has a 7-second long sound dropout in the TrueHD soundtrack at timecode 1:40:45 - all copies of the Blu-ray currently available are affected. The TrueHD soundtrack of the previously released HD DVD does not suffer from this dropout (nor does the Blu-ray's lower quality DD soundtrack), so it is clear this was an encoding goof-up on Warner's part.This type of QC problem is unacceptable for a product that costs $20, yet Warner has not mentioned any intention of fixing the issue. Hopefully they get on the ball and set up a replacement program for those who buy this defective disc.Note that the recent re-release of this disc still suffers from the dropout problem. Maybe the third time will be the charm... :\"
3,Okay...,"I was born in 1977 (around the time they cancelled the tour when Plant's son died), so I never got to see the Zep in concert. So I was pretty excited when I heard that this video was available a while back.But there are a few things that I noticed. Plant sounded like he was losing his voice, the music wasn't always synched with the video, too many ""cheesy"" (IMO anyway) effects, etc. This couldn't possibly have been the best footage available, could it? As much of a ZepHead as I am, I still cannot call this the best representation of them on film. It isn't, from what I've seen otherwise.Most expensive home movie ever made? Feels like it. I enjoyed the music, but the visual needed more work."
5,The Song Remains The Same - The Music With Energy.,"I've not seen a video of a live performance with such raw energy and talent since watching Led Zep performing in the movie ""The Song Remains The same"". Jimmy Page really tapps into ""the Cosmic Energy"" as Robert Plant refers to it. Some music can really stir the soul and Zeppelin's music really hits the spot. It takes certain frequencies to stimulate the sympathetic nervous system and cause one to feel good; like Hendrix and Pink Floyd they were the masters. Cosidering it was 1976 when I first viewed ""The Song"",Iwould have to say that it was ahead of its time especially with the ""Dazed and Confused"" clip."
3,Decent book,"The book is decent on it's selection of Shaker style furniture and steps on building them. The pictures are a bit thin and the steps themselves are sometimes cloudy and not very clear. Over all, it is a good book to have in your library to have as inspiration, but don't expect too much."
4,Cardio to sculpting.,This is a great DVD. I use this dvd 3 times a week and Gilad's 45/45 dvd two times a week. I have never enjoyed a dvd so much. Gilad really knows how to work you out and it be enjoyable at the same time. Makes you fell like you can't wait to work out.Give it an A+++++++++++++++++++
2,New Best of Bodies In Motion,"The workout parts of the video are good, but the breaks in between when Gilad is flying from one island to another are annoying and break the continuous movements of the workout."
2,Okay but not great,"I love Gilad, but this DVD had to much of everything but excersise. Did not want to keep stopping and watch him fly his plane to locations and talk. I was really upset that the excersise was not continuous and I had to stop and wait throughout the CD. I ordered another one that I recieved today from Gilad from the Earlier years, these are the Best."
5,Great Exercise DVD,"I originally bought this workout on VHS years ago and lost it, and it was the saddest time of my life because I couldn't workout to it! So I'm really happy that Amazon had it on DVD. It's a great workout, taking portions of various Gilad Bodies In Motion workouts and combining them into one 70-minute series. He does low-impact aerobics & strength training, high-impact aerobics, abs, buttocks, and a cool down. Great intervals, too! It is a little old (the segments are from the workouts on TV in the 80s and early 90s), but it's definitely effective. I do it everyday after work."
4,Best of new Bodies in Motion,"I have been using this workout DVD for about a month several days a week. It suits me well, as some days I don't want to do the whole workout and so I can select the parts I want to do. I have many of Gilad's workouts and they work."
5,excellent workout,I bought 3 Gilad workout dvd's and this is one of them I use all three by alternating them and I've seen such an improvement in my body. I bought Gilad because I have bought other workout dvd's that just didn't keep my interest or were to harsh on my joints. I worked out with Gilad in the 90's and these fit right in with what I'm looking for. I get an awesome workout. I love all three. Highly recommend them. Work up a sweat every time.
3,feel a bit mislead,"I love the newer Gilad from his show on FitTV, but this is from 1980's. This is high-impact aerobics. However, if you can physically do this sort of workout, it is challenging and wull get you in the best shape ever."
4,Best of Gilad,"Thank you for your great service, in sending out the DVD, ""Gilad Best of Bodies In Motion."" It is exactly what I expected. It got here promptly and safely. The DVD works fine. I wasn't sure what content was on it, nevertheless I appreciated the workouts. I love your selection of all that you offer. Thanks Amazon! You are great."
5,Excellent!,"This video workout is excellent! Easy to follow and a nice variety to keep it interesting. Gilad makes me want to get up and exercise, the video is fun with good music. Definitely one of my favorites!"
5,Gilad is the greatest!,"I worked out to Bodies In Motion 20 years ago after the birth of my son and I lost 20 lbs in about three months. His workouts are no-nonsense and he is soooo motivating, its infectious. I fell off the wagon for a little while, but his bootcamp style is just what I need to whip myself into shape. Keep it up Gilad because you have a fan for life."
2,I want my money back!,"Gilad is without a doubt a good instructore. Unfortunatley, he and his producers do not know how to put together a good best of tape. In and of themselves, the different workouts are wonderfull. However, Gilad flying back and forth to the different islands and the cut and breaks inbetween each segmant is quite anoying not to mention distracting. It wouldn't be so bad if he had cut down on the number of cuts by keeping each segmant grouped into one continues cut instead of breaking each section by flying around (i.e. keep all the ab workouts together)"
5,Always a great workout with Gilad,"I miss it when he was on ESPN, I used to work out with him every day when I was younger and in better shape. I just had a baby and wanted to get back in shape and popped in this video I've had for years. He is always fun to workout with and very motivating. Even if you have the extra weight or you're in great shape, he is stimulating and challenging. I always feel good after working out to his videos. I hate other videos like Abs of Steel that are mundane and made for those in perfect shape..this one I can always relate to, find a pace and always find a challenge as well. I wish he was still on TV and also on DVD. You can't go wrong with any of videos regardless of when they were made or the sound quality (which I think is fine)."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This dvd is awful. Gilad is in an airplane and every few minutes, the workout stops and goes to a different island. It is jumpy, you can never get a good workout because they are constantly returning to the cockpit of the airplane and he tells you what island you are going to. I don't care what island I am going to, I am looking for a good workout. This is just a ridiculous way of splicing a workout together. All the cardio is walking and jogging in place. Chances are, I will not order another one of his workouts if it is like this one."
2,Misleading,I was hoping this product would be the latest work from Gilad. When I put it into the DVD player I realised it was not. This is some of his older stuff (late 80's 90's) and not the workouts you find on FitTv at the moment. It does have some comical value though. The scene on the moving ship is very funny.Shame is wasn't the latest stuff as that is much better than what's on this DVD.
3,i can't believe i bought this...,"This is the most uninticing footage I've seen of Gilad. And maybe thats b/c I was born in the 80's and grew up in the 90's, but this dvd was just TOO tacky and TOO cheezy for me. I became a big fan of Gilad watching his exercise shows on FIT Tv. And though a minimal amount of those moves and routines are carried into this 80's nightmare dvd, its just not the same as his modern Tv show. But hey, exercise is exercise right? Wrong. Exercise videos need to motivate in all aspects ranging from music, to easy to learn moves and instructions. Some moves I found are the typical 80's style dancing motion of moving left to right while snapping your fingers. WHO snaps their fingers this day and age?? Definitely not my generation. And forget the music! It wasn't even exercisable 80's music.I think I was better off purchasing a TiVo and recording his Tv shows. But if you can stomach the cheezyness of 80's music, clothing, hairstyles, and dance moves-- then go for it."
1,Audio version is horribly cut,"The small print: Abridged. The CD is not worth it! It skips complete chapters.According to MacMillan Audio they cut out complete chapters to ""reduce the cost"".However they think the little abridged on the package is enough to warn you. I think it is deceptive and Amazon should not be selling these."
4,It's worth the trip.,"OK, Compton isn't Harry Combs or Larry McMurtry, and there's that stale and predictable romance between the hardbitten hero and the scrappy farm girl. But Compton does offer an authentic picture of a trail drive across a landscape easterners can only dream about, and the man knows his history. I was pleased to see that the savagery on both sides of the Commanche conflict was accurately depicted--no PC here, thank God. Compton's neither a stylist nor a plotting genius. He just tells a good story about interesting (if limited) characters living their lives in a fascinating time and place."
1,portugal*the algarve,Worst travel video i have ever seen. Doesnt identify towns and or areas being shown. Appears to be old film with minimum updates. Video claims to be 27 minutes long. Approximatley 15-17 minutes of the Algarve and 10-12 minutes of commercials. Would not recommend this video to anyone. Truly disappointing. Would like to return. Can you credit my account for future purchases. Do you have any travel videos on portugal you would recommend? Planning to visit Portugal next spring [april-may].
4,Quality medicated canine shampoo,"Bought this to use on our Shih Tzu who had a chronic skin condition. After much trial and error, we found that the iodine based shampoo soothed his skin better than most other shampoos, and if he did manage to scratch himself and break the skin, any inflammation that may develop is greatly diminished compared to results using other shampoos."
4,Walking Juhosephat,A book where metaphors get up and walk around to interact with characters and eat jam and such. Brautigan killed himself because his writng was so beautiful and poignant and true and he was suc ha liar. This is the book to read if you like jam. eat jam and read Trout Fishing in America.
3,"Beautiful music and playing, but technically flawed","I just received this CD for my birthday. These are wonderful pieces of music, the best musicians, great playing but ... There is a high frequency noise that is modulated by the music that is exasperating. If I were further away and not listening carefully, I might not notice. Sitting and listening carefully, it was just too annoying to finish. There is just something seriously wrong with the mastering of this CD. These guys are way too good to have something like this overlooked in a released CD. If it were fixed in a re-master, I would buy it again - the music is superb."
3,Blazing Djembe.,"While I like certain tracks on this CD, I regularly fast forward others which seem to be Sabar drumming not djembe. What I think is unfortunate is that this CD should showcase distinct rhythms that we know and love from the West African diaspora and not simply concentrate on cranked up soloing. It is very difficult to hear the Dun Dun parts behind the blur of the blazing solos and there is a lack of echauffments so typical of Guinea arrangement niceties. This CD really seems to be missing some traditional songs and vocals which would have definitely enhanced these recordings.Don't get me wrong some of the solos are utterly sick and you can pick up some chops if you listen to it over and over again while playing along."
4,Best book.,My husband and I did the entire treck with no porters or guides. We only used this guide book. Got lost once but that was our fault and only had to spend another day in the village.. Best trip.
5,Very good choice for backpacking trip to Annapurna,"I purchased this book in preparation for a trip. Going to trip tomorrow so this review is written before the trip. This is a very good book for somebody who is planning to do a trip in Annapurna region in Nepal. The book is good in size so fits well into a day-pack. Very good and relevant information with detailed maps of many treks that you can take, solid advice on medical aid, hotels, things that you allowed to do and things that should not be done. This is not a book about history or details of which tourists attractions to see - there are highlights and short description on these.Overall, it is a great book for the backpack traveler in Nepal."
4,VERY INFORMATIVE,"I learnt quite a bit from reading this book. It's very informative, but it ain't Lonley Planet"
4,A Wonderful Guide!,"I bought this fantastic little guide in a bookstore in Kathmandu. I used it during my trek around Annapurna and I cannot recommend it highly enough. Much better than the LP guide, and small enough that it doesn't get in the way."
4,Shirt fits nice!,"The color is perfect, the quality is all Dickies' and it fits nice. The length is a little longer than I expected, but I need to pay attention to the styles as Dickie's has various short sleeve versions. Just look inside the shirt in the washing instruction's tag for a model"
5,beautiful record of a moment in time,I felt the book displayed a wide range of images that stepped a long way beyond the bounds of cliche images that it could easily have sucummbed too. It portrays very special moments from around the world at a time in history when people were brimming with excitment & expectation & emotion. The book was a visual feast that both myself & my friends enjoyed paging through & I will treasure for a lifetime.
5,History in the making,Dawn of The 21st Century is a wonderful photographic representation of our time. The pictures are varied and visually compelling. It is a wonderful record of how average people saw and celebrated the turning of the millennium.
4,Excellent,This is a fabulous souvenir of the turning of the millennium. The project is fascinating and the content of the book is highly engaging.I found myself flipping through the pages for hours.It made me want to celebrate the millennium all over again.
1,Boooooring ...,and very dull and slow. My daughter loves mystery books. She read this aloud to me. Neither of us were impressed. My daughter kept asking why they continued to enter the house without the owner's permission. She also kept asking where the mystery was. We read more than half of the book and decided to give up on it. I was disappointed since I had heard such wonderful things about this series and was looking forward to it. I'm glad that we only ordered this one and none other.
5,Great!!!!!!!!!!!,I love this book so much!:) It took me about 3 days to read and was awesome! Trixie inspires me because she's about my age and is a practical farm girl kind of like me! And through out the book lessons are learned from her mistakes and friendships are made!
5,The Best Set of Books Available for Youngsters,"I have enjoyed reading the entire seris of Trixie Belden Mysteries! My neighbor gave me the first for christmas when I was ten and I was hooked. Even now I appreciate the tightness of the story line and the exceptional and ACCURATE detail. My 9 year old son is reading them now and I lament the lack of copies in print. These are excellent pieces of liturature and their timeless exhuberance makes them interesting even to our 'modern' tech dependent children. If only there were more of these wholesome interesting stories avaliable! REPRINT them, Please!"
2,Making it a set,"My niece just turned 7 and is a good reader, who is encouraged to work hard and aspire. I wanted to share my guilty summer-reading pleasure and so I introduced her to Trixie this summer with the first 3 books in the series. In a way, this is an American Girl experience for someone in 2012 living in rural (actually, exurban) Kansas, as well as giving her a worthwhile book-friend. As her older sister was growing up, I often thought that she reminded me of Trixie in some ways (except doing better in school). So...I was making it a set and sharing the memories and was glad for help from Amazon. (I want Ginny Gordon, girl entrepreneur, re-released. Ginny, Trixie, and the Cherry Ames, WWII student nurse, were my fun reading.)"
5,Grandma's gift,I loved the Tracy Belden series as a youth and purchased this book as a gift to my 9 year old granddaughter. She loved that it was speedily shipped directly to her and is now enjoying the mystery novel.
5,What happy memories this brings back!,I'm 44 and I grew up in Tennessee spending many lazy summer days reading about Trixie and Honey's adventures. The Secret of the Mansion was my favorite closely followed by The Mysterious Visitor. I think Julie Campbell was the best Trixie author but all are great reads - I only wish I had a daughter to share them with!
4,Brings back childhood memories.,I started reading Trixie and friends when I was about ten years old and I grew up with her. I am now 47 years of age and I don't know what happened to my childhood books but I now have (with the help of friends) all but 4 or 5 of them. I love The Secret Mansion because it was the very first one and I always wanted Trixie to grow up and marry Jim.
5,Unpretentious Girl Hero,"I fell in love with the Trixie Belden books when I first read them as a kid. Trixie was my kind of girl: unconcerned with being ""feminine,"" more concerned with speaking her mind and with action. The Secret of the Mansion, the first book in the series, is excellent. I read it again recently, just to see how my memory compared with the actual quality of the book, and I'm pleased to say that as an adult I still think the book is excellent. The characters are real and interesting, the plot moves smoothly, the writing serves the purpose. Tweens who love mysteries will enjoy this book."
5,Founding Fathers; Uncommon Heroes,"The book was in excellent condition. I wasn't aware there were different editions of this book. The one we already owned was the LDS Edition, but we have used it so often, the pages were coming loose. I really wanted the LDS Edition, but the one you sent wasn't LDS. However, it was in great condition and I have since found that the LDS Edition is out of print. I wouldn't hesitate to order from Amazon again."
1,Really Bad,"This book will not impress anyone who is out of high school. It is written at a very low level with poor objectivity.To be fair, the author is a layperson with no formal advanced degree in the subject of history. However, it shows and the book is a big waste of time especially when Ellis et al. are putting out the real deal on this subject."
5,Brings these men to life!,"The way history is often taught in American schools is to cram a lot of names, dates and figures in just long enough to pass a test, then subsequently forget them. Reading Founding Fathers -- Uncommon Heroes reminded me just how fascinating American history truly is, and how rich a heritage we have. So many of the freedoms we enjoy today we owe to sacrifices these men and other men and women made, yet they faced many of the same personal challenges and crises we encounter today. The book reveals many interesting, humorous and touching tidbits about their lives, bringing them to life like never before. I couldn't put it down, and I hope it is followed by another profiling others who helped make America the great country it is today!"
1,"INDEPENDENCE IS ONE THING, FREEDOM IS ANOTHER.","Any reader of this book, who would not let blind patriotism erode his or her morality, will refuse to be swayed by the sycophantic elements that greased the book.Certainly, the ""founding fathers"" are 'uncommon heroes' of independence. However, when it boils-down to true liberty and justice, they become the exact opposite of 'uncommon heroes': uncommon villains! The fact that they screamed freedom and condoned slavery testified to this point.It is time that we emancipate our minds, and understand that independence does not always connote freedom and justice."
5,The best book there is out there.,I Love this book it has so much information to gain form it for such a little cost. I think that everyone should get this book you will learn so much about the leaders that have bulit this county.
2,Religious slant to this book,"This would have been a fine book if it was not for the slanted vision of the religious nature of some of the founders. The total lack of reference and denial of the harsh vision Jefferson had of religion and the religious is particularly off the mark. In addition Franklin and Washington, both known rationalists, are presented as traditional Christians. Finally, it is quite sad that Thomas Paine, a vocal atheist, and a man so pivotal to our nation is almost totally ignored."
4,"A little dated, but good","I enjoy step aerobics and found I had a decent workout with Gilad Step Aerobics. I did sweat, and I felt winded as well. I missed a few of Gilad's cues, but overall he's pretty easy to follow. He uses simple steps that combine together for a fairly entertaining workout. You can tell it's an early 90's video by the clothing and hair styles. The music wasn't the greatest, but it becomes almost muted after awhile. There are few, if any, definite breaks for water, but the tape is divided into segments (and given an estimated length of time). Gilad does not really provide any suggestions for increasing or decreasing the pace of the workout. Overall, I feel the Gilad video is a good (not great) workout and would recommend Gilad if you are in the mood for some decent sweating."
4,You GOT THE MOVES!...,Not bad...not dancy at all and gets the job done. I gave it a 4 though because the third sequence is sooooo repetitive. About 100 turn steps in a row..then 50 over the tops...zzzzzz
3,Gilad Step Aerobics - On the Beach at Waikiki [VHS],not Just what I wantednot just how I wanted itI would not recommend it to everyonenot in perfect condition I love it
5,Excellent Step Tape If .....,"If you are: 1) relatively new to step aerobics; 2) are a guy who feels clumsy about attempting step aerobics but secretly want to give it a try without feeling like a sissy; or 3) are seeking a decent step aerobics workout without challenging choregraphy ... then this is your tape. Gilad is a great instructor. Hawaiian beach ... peppy steel guitar music ... great mix of men and women exercisers. Highly recommended - but not if you are seeking Dance Fever on step. You won't find it here. It's a respectable low to mixed impact workout, though. Have fun!"
2,Not All That,I bought this video mainly because of the great customer reviews. I am somewhat disappointed in this video. Okay I gave it two stars because the video is filmed in Waikiki. But the actual exercise is pretty boring. If your like me and you enjoy variety in an exercise than this is not for you. Gilad repeats the same things over and over again changing the routine about a few times during the entire workout. It had me wondering when is it gonna finish? And the ab workout wasn't all that great either. You know I should actually have given this 1 star. Because I bought and did it once and don't plan to do it again.
4,Easy for beginners,I really enjoy this video and plan on buying another one for a new change. After working out with Gilad I really feel good about myself and feel I have acomplished something for the day. Enjoy!
5,Excellent workout!,"This is an excellent workout for any fitness level. He divides the workout into 4 different sections, so you only do what you can handle. I am dragging hiney by the end of the 4th section--and then there is an abs section yet too. Gilad is an excellent instructor and explains things well. The only down side is that you need 60 minutes to complete the entire workout--not always easy with an 8-month old!"
2,Hmmm...,"I wouldn't bother with this one - I think it was just an excuse to stand in front of a beach and look good. Although the initial choreography was fine, it wasn't well taught and by the end it was just a joke. Save your money."
2,Annoying!,"Gilad has a decent enough step work out, but his inane comments and the relentless polka music on Waikiki Beach is aggravating. If you want a serious step workout, try something by Gin Miller or Keli Roberts instead."
1,cheap xerox on newsprint,Do not buy this book. It is a cheap xerox of an older edition and the images barely show up. It is printed on very poor quality paper. I returned mine immediately.
5,CD - Treasures from the Folk Den,Thank you so much for such a pleasant transaction. It was a birthday gift and my friend was very surprised and has told me many times how much he enjoys listening to this CD.
4,"Beautiful, Entertaining and Realistic story line",Ihave had the VHS for years and decided to buy the DVD for my collection. Michael York is superb and so are the rest of the cast. I love Hugh Grant but not in this role. The story is so absorbing . The filming is great. I am sure anyone watching this will not be disappointed.
4,Excellent epic mini-series,"First of all - let me begin by saying how biased I am. I absolutely love both Barry Bostwick and Bruce Boxleitner!!! And both are excellent in this movie. Barry as Mac the tenacious, but oh so handsome first love of Freddie's (Courtney Cox) life. The movie spans a generation and watches two women grow into their own. It is filled with love, sex, deceit and WWII drama. This is a very romantic film and if you have the time to put into it, it comes highly recommended!!!"
1,Not easy to understand,"I do not find the book suitable for an introductory course in linear algebra. It takes too much time to get through a page in this book due to the use of heavy mathematical language. The examples are not enough to help a student solve the exercices at the end of the book, so often times one has to always rely on the TA office hours to get a homework done. I do not recommend buying this text for a beginner in linear algebra, unless if it's required text for a course."
1,Solution Manual incomplete.,"The book itself is difficult to read. When new symbols are first used, the explination are burried in the text and time consuming to find. The use of dark blue ink to ""color"" the items they are refering to is very difficult to distiguish from the normal black text. I waste more time trying to figure out what the symbols mean than I spend understanding the concepts.The solutions manual covers every 3rd problem, not the compleete set of odd problems like it should (eg. 1,4,7,10...). Detail on the problems is average at best."
1,Linear Algebra,"Having passed all previous math courses (up to multivariable calculus) with compete understanding and great grades, I have earned the right to determine how unskilled this book truly is. Every other math book I have experienced is understandable and has examples for all types of problems. This book has few examples, and they are horribly explained. Then, to make it all worse, these examples are not the same types of questions as the chapter questions! This is quite honestly the worst textbook experience I have ever had. I would rate this book with no stars, but amazon will not take that as a rating, so one will have to suffice."
1,Linear Algebra,Having completed much of my Engineering curriculum (spending much time with my face in a math based text over the last few years) I have to say that this is the most useless textbook I have had to date. From a students perspective It is very difficult to read and the examples are limmited. Althought this book may be technically correct in every aspect it is not a good learning aid! Most of my fellow students have found other resources to copensate.
1,Absolutely Brutal,"I've recently had the misfortune of having this book as my text for an introductory linear algebra book. The subject can be hard enough to understand on its own, but this book makes it even worse. The examples are sparse at best, and most of the time are wasted by displaying the proof of a cryptic concept instead of actually assisting to answer the questions in the book. Even worse, when the book does provide a practical example, it often only shows the steps used to complete the problem, not even bothering to explain it! If you are stuck with this book as a course text, I would highly recommend finding a second, more useful book if you wish to get more than a passing grade."
5,The American debut of Air Supply,"British-born Graham Russell and Australian-born Russell Hitchcock first met in 1975 while acting in the play JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR. These songs were first released in 1979 in the United Kingdom and Australia,respectively. The title track was the duo's(they had session musicians joining them) debut single in America in February 1980. Subsequent hits were EVERY WOMAN IN THE WORLD,CHANCES and ALL OUT OF LOVE. There's also the country-flavored OLD HABITS DIE HARD and the disco-flavored JUST ANOTHER WOMAN. GR and RH are the so-called Kings of Love Songs so they won't need to put out an album entitled ""Love Songs"". The duo put out a handful of albums on the Arista label following this one throughout the 1980's. The duo's labelmates include Barry Manilow,Melissa Manchester,Ray Parker Jr. & Raydio,Dionne Warwick,Jermaine Jackson,Whitney Houston,The Kinks and later,Hall & Oates."
4,Soothing music that focuses on love and relationships,"The instrumentals are actually very diverse, and although it is considered ""bubble gum pop"" compared to todays' standards, the music takes me back to my teen years in the 80's"
5,MUSI TO RELAX TOO.,WHEN AIR SUPPLY CAME OUT IN THE 8OS THEY HADA SOUND THAT NO OTHER BAND COULD REPROUDCE .THE SOUND WAS SOOTHING .YET THEY HAD ONE HIT AFTER ANOTHER.
4,Awesome!,"A perfectly cool CD! This was a great CD for Air Supply to introduce themselves to the US with. ""Lost In Love"" and ""All Out Of Love"" are absolutely incredible! Russell Hitchcock's vocals are pure gold. ""Just Another Woman"" is a somewhat repetitive but very upbeat song. And I love ""American Hearts"". It's so true! This CD is really cool. I love it!"
3,Errores por corregir,"Espero que esta version de las fabulas de Iriarte sea corregida pronto. Hay muchos errores tipograficos. Otro detalle que no me gusta es que se necesita un tipo de fuente muy chico para ver por completo el final de muchas de las fabulas o de lo contrario se ven irremediablemente incompletas. Sea un problema del reader o de formato del libro, jamas lo habia visto hasta ahora. Ahora lo curioso es que la edicion gratuita adolece de los mismos errores."
1,Difficult to Follow,"I had to buy this book for one of my classes. It's terrible! I thought abstract algebra was hard to follow but this book makes abstract algebra seem like a cakewalk. The material is interesting but often confusing. Proofs are not in depth and the examples BARELY help. Definitions seem to contradict each other because of the way things are worded so similarly. This book is TOO formal which makes conceptualizing theorems impossible. Often times, notations are used without explanation. If you are a beginner, avoid this book at all cost. If you're an expert, then you might like it.The reason I am giving this a one star is because it is no ""introduction""."
3,Readable but a bit rough,"It tries to be a readable undergrad introduction and mostly succeeds. Explanations are generally not tight and memorable, proofs seem loose, there are sometimes gaps in the train of thought, and exercises often require a significant conceptual leap from the preceding text. It was particularly annoying the way he suddenly switched to Polish notation for a while and then just as suddenly dropped it, without any obvious benefit. However, it is more accessible than most mathematical logic texts. The main competition for this text would be Ebbinghaus, which I prefer. The benefits of Enderton over that book are that it covers a wider range of topics and has a lot more exercises."
3,good visual book for first time managers,I am a first time manager and I found this to have good short introduction to most of the topics for dealing with managing a team. Many of them are obvious but it is good to put it all in one place and in a visual fashion. It does have the problem of not pointing to other places to get more detailed information.
2,"Mostly commonsense, cliff note version of a real Mgmt. book","This book covers the right topics but does not give you much if any information. Might be good as a high school business starter book. I think more effort went into the layout of clip art and photos than the content of the book. Each topic is covered in a page or two, consisting mostly of a paragraph or two of text woven around much artwork."
4,A concise introduction to supervisory skills and techniques,"This book is exactly what the back cover claims it is -- ""an introduction . . . for readers with no time to waste."" I agree with other reviewers that it provides more visual sophistication than in-depth content. My major complaint with the artwork and format is that large blocks of black text appear on dark blue, dark green, and purple backgrounds -- a real challenge to the eyes. Yet the book is well-organized, and the range of topics touched upon is more comprehensive than any product I have seen in this price range. I buy it in quantity and give it to participants in my ""Leadership for New Supervisors and Managers"" seminar. It's an affordable guidebook that provides a framework for the specific ""how to"" details I deliver myself."
3,Love love love these bottles!,Great bottles! I love them bc my preemie will only take soothie nipples and you can only use the soothie bottles with them. I bought the originial evenflo nipples and these bottles bc the NICU recommended them. There even cheaper than most bottles and still prevent gas as well.
2,I don't care for this.,I bought this bottle for my aunt who recently had a baby. I take care of her baby alot and wanted to find the right bottle for him. He tends to have gas so didnt' want a bottle that would possibly cause more. This bottle makes a sound while he is sucking that sounds like air being suck in. It sounds like he is swallowing air as he sucks. The positive thing is that it is a inexpensive bottle. It also did not leak at all. It was easy to clean. The only problem is the air I hear. I placed the bottle down after a feeding and I hear the air being sucked in. So I'm going to continue my search in finding the right bottle.
4,All parties treated fairly,"""Diana: Story of a Princess"" is an excellent book about Princess Diana etc. that seems fair to all parties. This book chronicles the lives of Charles and Diana, their meeting, courtship, marriage, separation, divorce, lives after divorce and Diana's tragic death.This book is very interesting. It offers viewpoints from many different individuals on various aspects of Diane and Charles' story. I have read several books about Princess Di - all of them fascinating - though this book (""Diana: Story of a Princess"") really gets into the aspect of the press and their role in Diana's life.Through this book I was able to envision a very vulnerable Diana. I also saw a person who loved much and needed much love. Princess Di was a very sensitive woman and I believe this quality made her the 'Queen of Hearts' and 'The People's Princess.'"
4,A Fair Telling of a Woman's Life,"As autobiographies go this was a rather interesting effort. I must say the authors treated all sides fairly when addressing the various complex issued that made up this woman's world.This book opens with her childhood and stops on various parts of her life which helped to create the woman she later became. With care and compassion the life of this woman is explained--giving insight to a world few enter or understand. Not every situation puts Diana in a glowing position which is fair as she was at time tempestuous, sassy, sad, and manipulative. In any event this is an entertaining read regarding one of the world's most beloved people. This is truly a book worth reading."
3,Adds nothing new,"If you are looking for a book that sheds new light on Princess Diana, keep looking. This book is a rehash of old stories. The only new information is details on Princess Diana's attempts to mold her image and trash that of Prince Charles. If you want to really learn about her, read Sally Bedell Smith's more authoritative and better researched book."
3,"Although Once Famous, Now Only Mildly Amusing","SEVEN KEYS TO BALDPATE concerns a novelist, Billy Magee, who seeks isolation to begin his next work and hopes to find it at Baldpate Inn, a mountainside resort now closed for the winter. When he takes up residence, however, he is startled to find his isolation repeatedly broken by a host of unexpected visitors, all of whom seem to be lying about their backgrounds and their reasons for arrival.Originally published in 1913, BALDPATE was among the most popular novels of its day--and its mixture of mystery and comic banter proved equally popular on both stage and screen. The basic premise would also prove very influential over the years. Still, and in spite of the deft touch with which Biggers handles the material, today the novel reads as highly artificial in both tone and construction. Fans of period pop fiction will likely enjoy it, but the book is unlikely to hold many charms for other readers.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"
3,"An oldie, but a goodie","If you like mystery, love stories that take place around the turn of the century, and are a bit corny, then this book will be a good easy read."
1,don't waste your time or money,"We read this book in our book club because we visited the inn near Estes Park that it is loosely based on. The inn is wonderful, the book is terrible. It is very poorly written in every aspect; so much so that it's a wonder anyone published it. Don't waste your time or money on this book."
3,black and white dvd,"I have been a long time fan of MM and looked forward to receiving this item. Perhaps I didn't notice in the description that it was black and white only, and I was a little disappointed with that. The narration was good, and I was left with a feeling of sadness for her after viewing it. Not much new information for me, but the tragedy of her life was effecively presented."
3,Welcome to Snailsville,"The Adventures of Snelgrove Snail takes place in an underwater village of Snailsville. Some dramatic story action takes place among the various puppets representing undersea creatures. Each adventure is filled with learning and laughter from Tommy Turtle, Sid the Squid, Stanley Starfish, Professor Periwinkle and Sherman Shark."
1,not widescreen,"Unfortunately, the people at DVD International are fond of showing water shots in small screen, whereas this material cries out for land shots in widescreen."
2,Disappointed,"I was very interested in this program and ordered it. The DVD I received was obviously defective. No title or headings, only a tedious repetition of four chapters. In agreement with other reviewer clouds and more clouds and more clouds predominated... ... The DVD was returned"
2,Ho Hum,"This is not exciting or awe-inspiring. The pictures are repetitive though well-photographed. The music is mundane and boring. There are far better examples of s[ace and music combinations. The IMAX 'The Dream is Alive' is far superior, although it has narration."
2,Disappointed,"I love Christmas romances, and try to read as many as I can during the season. This book was a major disappointment to me. The first story didn't even mention Christmas until literally the last few pages. A majority of the story took place in the summer/early fall! The second story was much better, but by that point I was kind tired of waiting for the anthology to get good. So I moved on to something else. I don't think I will give it another try. There was just nothing in the story or plot to ""grab"" me or make me interested in what would happen next."
5,excelent CG Bible.,"I think that this book gives an excellent and in depth review of the CG Animation World. Yes, two chapters are about the history of CG: they will tell you where you come from and make you understand better where you are now.I don't know who this hwilliamsx comes from, and what he is doing in VA, I'm an Animation Supervisor working at Imageworks for the past seven years and I am a Faculty Member at Calarts for three, my personal opinion is that this book is a must have.Third Edition speak by itself. Good work Isaac."
5,Amazing,"Just in Now!! I Receive my book order of amazon and is great. Full of tips, sketches, a lot of images from art movies in good print. Easy to read and enjoy to see. A Valuable acquisition for CG Making.Thanks for amazon to delivery. And specially gratefull for Isaac Viktor Kerlow , your quality work had surprised me. I lament the pages disposed in site not show the colorfull of the book."
2,Very little instruction,"This book was a required textbook for my begining Maya class, but be warned, it's more a book about concepts and 3D animation history than it is about instruction. If you need this book for a 3D animation class, I highly recomend getting another book with instuction specifically for whichever program you're using, because you're not going to find it in this one."
1,Way way way over my head!,"I am usually self-taught in all my interests, but this is one book that was beyondme. Maybe it's because I'm getting older, or maybe because the book is in a language from another planet!!!Anyway, it was too hard for me to spend time trying to grasp. But the seller sent it in good shape and fast."
1,Lacks depth,"This book really only covers a general concept of the computer animation field. For people wanting to just unearth the mere basics and lingo, the glossary at the end of each chapter might be useful. Besides that, the book lacks any real depth to the topics discussed, and is rather disappointing when these terms are freely available online. The ""Getting Ready"" tips for each section was laughable, written with the assumption that readers lack common sense. Furthermore, the unorganized structure of the book meant the referenced picture in the text is in MOST cases a few pages away. My 1 star goes to the coloured pictures and the glossary."
4,the art of 3d animation,"the book is an interesting read, especially if you like to learn about the history of 3d animation. The book also goes through the many methods involved within creating 3d animation and also supplies lots of art work to accompany the explanations. If your interested in learning 3d or just interested in the concept of 3d this book is definitely worth a read."
5,The best. Pure and simple...,"In short, this is the best introduction to any area of CGI/3D animation, no matter where your field of interest lies (games, film etc.). Damn, it is good. It is not software specific, which normally can be a bother, if you are working only in one package, but in this case the book is so well written and structured, that it is just a joy to go through."
2,Doesn't teach anything,"This book is just an overview of computer animation. You can't learn anything from it. I was hoping for a vanilla instruction book because I own Carrara and Hexagon and I have to buy Maya or Lightwave books and try to adapt them to Carrara and Hexagon. The pictures inside aren't that great either - the cover has the best characters. For the money, I would rather have bought another Maya or Lightwave book."
4,Lower Quebec History,Since my family came from the district where this story took place it was a very interesting insight as to the history of the area. I was unaware of the relationships between the habitants and the Indians and to the burning of the homes. Very informative.
4,The Marine Corp. Experiece in World War One!,"From a first hand account of the Marines in World War One it was excellent. Thomason is readable and articulate in engaging and drawing the reader into his experience. His accounts, while not a day by day rendering of the Marines, delves into the ""emotional"" and ""personal"" aspects of the war. A classic in my opinion."
2,Not text book!,i was under the impression that this was the text book because of the picture but instead it was the lab manual. Their should be a clearer description for the title of this book.
2,Missing technology package,"The description states it is supposed to come with a technology package, including a CD. I received a textbook in perfect condition, but no access codes, or CD."
1,terrible,I will never order from this company or amizon ever again. The comunication skills suck and I promised things that did not happen. I will go else where next time I need to oder anything.
1,Disappointed in Ohio,It is a shame that my daughter had to suffer because this person Carrie2673 was not honerable in sending her the product we paid for.we never recieved the book we ordered and Carrie2673 never responded to our complaints. I hope no one else has to go thru this.
2,"uninspired, rote, perfunctory remixes","I started to give this CD three stars for at least being decent background music - until I realized I'll probably never hear it again. There's no need to. Nothing here really turns me on beyond the appeal most of these singles had in the first place. Depeche Mode's music could potentially inspire the best remix music ever. Instead, this album feels like going through the motions. And DM must really be hurting for inspiration for them to turn to Linkin Park for help. Yuck!Additional note: it would be nice if some of these reviewers would read other opinions instead of just spewing their own. My review is right on par with a lot of the other ones, but I suspect they didn't bother to review mine. Ya get what ya give, baby! On the other hand, maybe they resent my opinion about Linkin Log, in which case they have awful taste in music anyway."
2,Depeche Mode Remixes 1,"This is a one disc set of a slimmed down version of the three-disc remix set which is available for a lot more money.It is difficult to remix Depeche Mode when they have such great songs to begin with. So I find it hard to add anything new to the originals to make them seem better.Some of the beats are okay and some remixes work better than others. The list price is way too much for what you get.Overall though, you'd be much better starting with the individual albums themselves."
2,Get the originals instead,"The members of Depeche Mode know what they're doing. Most, if not all, of their songs are perfectly produced and it's difficult to improve on them (that means you, Marilyn Manson.) There are some really good remixes on the 3 CDs. These are the mixes that don't put in stuff just because they can - they're clean and simple but add another level to the song (the Air remix to ""Home"" and ""World in My Eyes (Mode To Joy)"" are the two best.) Most of the mixes, however, are just the same remixes that I wouldn't even listen to in a club - they're overworked and tired. Skip the remixes and get the originals."
3,for kids around 3 yrs old,"This game is too simple for kids over 3 yrs old. I wish they had included more pieces so the game would be more interesting. My 4 yr old and 5 yr old got bored quickly. They don't want to play it anymore, only having it a couple weeks."
3,How Tall Am I game,"My young preschooler likes to play this game. Best of all, it doesn't take long to play so they don't get bored with it like some. It's the most simplest game. For a little older kids, it would just be to easy."
2,Its okay not great,"My three year old son got this for Christmas. He was not very impressed, its not good for short attention spans. My kids would rather just mix and match the pieces rather than actually play the game."
4,"Very good, simple game.","This is very good and my 5 year old likes to play this game. It is very basic and simple but easy and fun for kids to play. If you want to avoid electronic games with a lots of bells and whistles this is for you. We also play variations on the game such as who is shorter, and building specific characters first rather than measuring them."
4,Great game for younger 3's and 4's,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my young 3 yr old and she LOVES it! It plays very quick and can be played with someone or alone. It is better suited for younger children (3-4) I think. It's very easy! Good deal for the money!
5,Excellent Footage for A.P. History,"This volume contains six separate, short films produced by the FDR administration. The highlights of the films are indepth views of the WPA and the origins of Social Security. Also key is the footage of the 1937 Ohio-Mississippi River flood around Louisville."
1,"Don't waste your time with this ""book""...","I own over 60 poker related books and dvd's and this is only the 2nd book I have ever sent back. It is just a compilation of information from other books, and a bunch of useless information (how to build a poker table?? don't they sell those in several stores??). Please save your money for one of the myraid other poker titles that will actually teach you something. It sure has a NICE TITLE, and a review from one of his friends, but don't let either sway you."
2,"Very little ""Pressure"" in this book","I was pretty disappointed with this book. Much of it is fluff filler, guest authors, and introductions to online poker. There are very few hand examples, and frankly I didn't learn a thing about how to be a more aggressive No Limit poker player. Some sections include how to do chip tricks, how to build a poker table, the glory of 72 off suit, and other useless information. Mostly this book is a waste of time."
1,no compren este producto,"recientemente compre 2 harmonicas y lamentablemente cuando me lleg√≥ ambas llegaron rotas, aplastadas y depaso solo trajeron 1 solo libro, es una estafa y ahora lamentablemente tengo que pagarlas por una mala entrega de amazon, estoy muy decepcionado"
3,"""Standard bidding"" would have been a better title.","Standard bidding was well explained. If you just want to learn/refresh yourself on standard bidding, that's great. But forget it if you want explanations, tradeoffs, etc., then this book falls short. I felt like a series of point ranges were presented to me, a series of hundreds of rules. But I got the sense that there was an underlying logic to the various bids that was just not being explained. A reverse used to be considered non-forcing but now is considered forcing. That's nice. But why? Don't call a book ""commonsense"" if you just lay out a series of rules and don't explain them."
1,Bad Kindle edition,"The kindle edition is badly done. It is almost unreadable with layout, graphic and typographical errors. While the printed book is valuable, the Kindle version should not be purchased"
4,Commonsense Bidding: The Most Complete Guide to Modern Methods of Bidding,It was very easy to use and was written in words I could understand. I would buy it for a friend who wanted to brush up on duplicate bridge. The quick service I got from Amazon was outstanding!
2,Outdated,Although I am a roots fan unfortunately this book is horribly outdated. Bridge bidding has changed a lot since this was written.
2,oily and sticky,The glycerin is oily and sticky and made my cat have more earwax than she had before. I stopped using it after a few days and stuck with moist pad wipes instead. My cat hates this so much she would run and hide underneath the bed at the sight of my holding up the bottle whereas she would tolerate the moist pad wipes.
2,Revolution works better,My cat hated this stuff and I hated holding him down to apply it over and over again. Makes the fur around his ear all oily and dirty for weeks. Revolution applied to the back of the neck kills all ear mites with just 2 applications given 3 weeks apart. Much easier.
1,Pyrethins,found out product contained pyrethins after I placed order. Found info on another website. One would think that as important as pyrethins are it would be listed in the product features!
2,ok,"These cat ears aren't soft and fuzzy, more sparkly. Not as cute as I thought, but fine. Not like I'd return it, just wouldn't suggest it if you're looking for fuzzy."
3,"Excellent Book, but for one thing","First the but, because it is most important. Except for the cover the images are in Black and White.Otherwise the book is excellent and a must have for art collectors. I hope that in the future Terry Rodgers' will publish a larger format color version of this book. The book is an excellent value perhaps due to low printing costs of black and white, but Terry's work is all about color."
3,"For those who need help ""solving the work/life dilemma","If you think this might mean you, go straignt to Chapter Two to find out for sure. Do you, for instance begin most conversations with ""Sorry I didn't call you back sooner, but I've been so busy""; feel constantly tired; buy yourself lots of little treats ""because you deserve it""; have no wish to be considered for your boss' job? The authors show you how to create a ""conscious life collage"", in which you choose only those aspects of your life you treasure, and assemble them into your own, workable design."
5,Purchase and be groovy.,"This headband is so bomb, guys. It fits well, is comfortable, is cool... the list is endless. If you're looking for some sort of aesthetic advancement that can both attract women and prevent sweat from descending thy forehead, look no further. Look here."
5,A Deep Understanding and Incredible Work,"This large book consists of two parts. The first 1/4 to 1/3 is Aziz' guided meditation. There is some insightful material but the real meat of this book is in the remainder which is question and answer which is grouped into chapters of like questions/answers. An amazing book, something like Nisargadatta's ""I Am That"", that I would return to time and time again."
5,The Real Thing!,"This is an extremely valuable book; in fact, it's a rare gem in a world of pseudo-advaitists and counterfeit gurus who claim to have overcome the ego, when in actual fact, they carry the biggest egos of all.While reading this book, especially Aziz's life story at the back, you can feel that he is the real thing. In short, he is a human being who has devoted his life searching for truth and, in the end, has found it. What's more, he has the rare and unique ability to explain the process of awakening to others.For sincere people on the spiritual path who truly yearn for a direct experience of God, his teaching is refreshingly clear, practical and brings results. I've never found such valuable guidance in books of a similar genre.Highly, highly recommended!Pierre D'Amours"
5,Best of Oldies: ),"It's a great movie!!! Some of the old movies are the best in the anime because of the plot and characters. I remember watching this on a scifi channel (which is where most people have seen it)and I was maybe 6 or 7 or maybe even earlier. I'm about 13 now and I still remember it even though its been years which helps prove its a good movie though I can't remember if it was the first or second. Great plot and animation, good characters and cool ending. I'd definetly want to see it over and over again."
4,"Weird, but I liked it","It's strange, this anime has all the things I hate: Bad art, bad dubbing, cheesey music but I found myself really enjoying it when I saw it recently. It's really rather entertaining. It's got such an interesting plot and cast of characters that the art and voices don't drag the film down (like some other anime) If you've been trying to decide if you'd like to watch this or not (like I was) go for it. You might enjoy it"
3,interesting,"this film in some ways was a Pre-cursor to Will Smith's ""Hitch"".Jamie Foxx is a writer who gives out advice.Morris Chestnut always got a role in the Soul Buppie flicks.Gabrelle Union is cool as always. this film works because it doesn't get to predictable though it does lose some points because not enough laughs or predictable runs in spots.still worth given a looking at."
2,Step Away From this Movie,I was greatly disappointed by this movie. It waste the talent of it's brightest stars such as Gabrielle Union and Morris Chestnut. The plot of this movie started great when the character Quincy played by Jamie Foxx is dumped by his girlfriend on the night he plans to announce their engagement. But from there The plot turns into a convulted mess. Gabrielle Union was the save of this movie. Which is sad really! She is such a amazing actress but Hollywood has yet to utilized her potential. Morris Chestnut plays Quincy cousin a player Who uses women for own selfish reasons. But here again an actor who was funny and wonderful in such movies as the Brothers and Two Can Play at This Game. Just was hanging by a slender thread. Jamie Foxx was very funny and clever but not enough to save this movie.
3,Breakin' All the Rules (Special Edition),"Qunicy Watson, after being unceremoniously dumped by his fianc√©e, pens a ""how to"" book on breaking up and becomes a best-selling author on the subject. Not wanting his male friends to suffer the same fate, he gives them advice on dumping their mates. A comedy of errors ensues. ""Breakin' All the Rules"" has some genuinely funny moments. It's not a classic but most of it is quite enjoyable. It sticks to the main point."
2,Comparisons bound to occur,"Just when our appetites are whetted by Jamie Foxx's gifts as an actor as demonstrated in this year's COLLATERAL and RAY, viewing his other film released this busy year for him - BREAKIN' ALL THE RULES - comes along and gives evidence of how important script and direction really are. This light bit of fluff is easily ignored as a movie with one great exception: here is a veritable feast of African American talent such as Foxx, the very beautiful Gabrielle Union and Bianca Lawson, Morris Chestnut whose talents are minimally utilized. The cast is rounded out by Jennifer Esposito and Peter MacNicol (remember him as Stingo in 'Sophie's Choice'?). The story is slight but at least it doesn't dumb down the audience. Viewing this film makes us pleased that Jamie Foxx has left the comedy mike and is committing to films that deserve his superb talents. Grady Harp, November 2004"
4,CUTE AND FUN.......,"Breakin' All The Rules is a mediocre-to-fun movie made more than serviceable by its awesome cast, which include Jamie Foxx, Gabrielle Union, and the gorgeous Morris Chestnut. Jamie Foxx stars as Quincy, who has been unceremoniously dumped by his girlfriend at their engagement party. When layoffs loom at his job, his boss asks him to research the science of firing employees--and Quincy discovers that the manner in which he was ""fired"" by his girlfriend was all wrong. Research leads to Quincy penning a runaway bestseller on how to break-up with your lover--chock full of theories tested out by cousin and best friend, Evan (Morris Chestnut). When Evan suspects that his current girlfriend Nicky (Gabrielle Union)is about to break up with him, he sends his cousin Quincy to plead his case. Mistaken identity ensues.....and the two become romantically involved. What follows is a hilarious tale of romance gone awry.....great fun!!DYB"
3,OK,"This movie is cute, but not hilarious. Entertaining, but not Unforgettable.Good date movie, but if you never see it, you're not missing anything."
4,Very Entertaining,"Jamie Foxx & Gabrielle Union are magnetic.Breaking up with someone is always a difficult thing; especially when the person being dumped isn't ready for the relationship to be over.But this film gives some great tips on how to do it and get out of the person's house in one piece. I just hope my woman doesn't use them on me! I would be seriously hurt! LOL!Fun film! One tip though, park your ride in your garage at all times!"
1,This Movie is Sorry,"I have not seen this movie since 2004, I am sorry to say that i support all black flims, but this was one the worst black films i have ever since. I did not like it and it was boring to me, I have seen low-budget black films with a better story line then this, you will either like this movie or like me hate it, so enjoy"
2,Couldn't wait to put it down... forever...,"Found this an extremely tedious read... pathetic characters ... from over the top evil to simply ignorant.. I cannot remember laughing, not even chuckling, once through this whole story. I only read it all the way through because I was hoping for at least one redemption of a character in this book. Never happened. Glad the torture of finishing this book is complete."
1,"Horrible, depressing read","I simply cannot believe I bothered to read this depressing book. Well written, but to no effect. No redeeming quality about 90% of the characters, and 100% of the major characters. Honestly, I have a wide-ranging reading style, but Yukio Mishima is more salvagable than this author. Avoid this depressing, fairly useless read. Give the author a lot of Prozac."
3,Kind of depressing,"It's depressing to think that so many people would be this petty, not a good thought or a uplifting book"
1,"have to agree with ""couldn't wait to put it down""",I kept reading this book hoping it would get better. Got through about half before giving up. Couldn't take any more. Sorry I actually purchased it. Definitely a downer. If I could have given it no stars I would.
2,Hard to Read,"I purchased this while it was $2, thinking I'd expand my reading topics. I can't finish the book. I think it could have been a good book - but the speach patters the charactors use drive me nuts. It reads like something a child would write. I read a lot and there are very few books I can't finish, but this one has twists and turns that don't seem to make sense, charators that seem stiff, and over all, just not a good flow."
4,Surgical Skill,This was in the same style as Bay of Love and Sorrows.The Bay of Love and SorrowsI like how Richards fillets the bone from the marrow of human thought and intent. It is revealing and left me confronting some of my own alterior motives. The setting was throughly Canadian as were the immigrant characters. Definitley worth the time.
3,Fabulous and flawed,"Parts of this book were glorious. Parts were drudgery. I enjoyed it overall, but feel it could have been edited down by about 1/4. Would encourage readers to skim, sometimes whole chapters. You'll know when you've hit a solid piece."
1,river of the broken hearted,"Book started out slow but usually after a few chapter it picks up. Got half way through and shut it down. Draggy, awful."
3,Good read.....,"This book is a good read. A little slower moving than I prefer in a book. One of those books I could put down, but would come back to."
1,"Depressing, with no redeeming value","I read a wide variety of books but have to question my judgment in buying and wasting my time reading this one. I slogged my way through the entire book, hoping (as other reviewers mentioned) to find at least one character with some redeeming value--at least one character that I cared about. Alas, that was not to be. I am sorry that I spent money on it. And even more sorry that I wasted precious hours of my life reading it. Don't waste your time or money. Pass this one up."
2,wanted it to be better,"The synopsis from the other reviews are accurate. The feud between the families is really one-sided as the main family keeps getting duped and manipulated by the other - over and over and over again for generations. There are a few laughs and some tiny victories but they are too few and far between. There is a bit of pay-off/resolution finally at the end, but I'm not sure it was worth all the tedium. I feel that the author communicates the characters' emotion well. However, the writing style can be difficult to follow. Sometimes within the same paragraph the setting and focal character changes with no transition. It will jump like this often. The book's voice is in the present, but he speaks almost in 1st person while following the chronology of 4 generations. I enjoyed the bits of cinema history, but again, not really worth the time."
1,I did not like this book at all,"I did not like the style of the writing. I felt like I was reading a diary, not a book. There were some interesting elements in the story, but it went on for way to long for the content. There were very few likable characters, and their actions rarely made sense to me."
1,Can I get my money back?,"River of the Dismal. River of the Cruel. River of the Boring. River of Mean People.River of Heartlessness. River of Not One Single Pleasant Moment. River of the Churlish, Banal, Pointless, Driveling, Piddling, and Wearying. What a waste of my time, energy and money."
4,I'm Happy But These May Have Limited Utility for Some,"As all you savvy online buyers know, things sometimes are a bit different when you get them than what you expect. So we carefully read about dimensions, volumes, etc.I am pleased with these glasses as I purposely bought them because I really liked the colors, treatment, shape, etc. of them even though I realized they were not utilitarian day-to-day use glasses for most people (unles you like drinking small amounts out of tall glasses with small bases). But I wanted to add a splash of color and interst to my bar (my bar glasses are visible) and they suit the purpose perfectly. Also, they are perfect for serving cocktails in and breaking out of the standard, rocks, highball, martini, etc. glass tradition. So I am happy!"
3,Ok Game,"This was my first Ds game and at first I thought it was awesome but compared to Asphalt Urban Gt and Need For Speed Underground 2 it stinks. It is an ok game though. Its very easy to play but its not really reilistic, and the graphics arn't that bad, but doesn't show a DS's full potential. Its sorta like pong, so easy that its fun for a while but then it wears off in about an hour. If you're thinking about getting a racing game you should just pass this one up. But if your looking for looking for an easy game to entertain little kids go ahead and get it used because its not worth 30 bucks."
5,Excellent racer for his time!,"Ridge Racer is one of my top list racers. Let me list the pros and cons:Pros:* Three different control schemes* Can choose between automatic and mechanic sticks.* Great drifting* Get to unlock different cars very time you beat a circuit (3 cars)* Can customize the color of your car.* The music is outstanding* A bit hard.Cons:* You must finish 1st in order to advance to other races.* The Ai is fantastic but sometimes unfairly so.* I wish I could design my own tracks.* It is the same whether you hit the side of the road, or a the rails or another car, same sound and same effect.To be fair it doesn't deserve a 5 star rating as it is (about 4.3-4.5) but as a first DS racing experience is great."
2,I'd rather be playing Ridge Racer R4,"I had high hopes for this game, and had fun for the first 6 races. Then it let me down, all the control options suck, and you can't see ahead on the track to anticipate turns at all. I'm selling this and going back to Ridge Racer R4 for the original playstation, this game NEEDS a good analog stick to play properly.This review may only legally be shown directly on Amazon.com"
4,"Great product, but missing a connecter.","This product worked great for my 2000 chevy silverado 1500. Everything fit like it was supposed to but when I was installing it, I noticed it did not have the third connection on the top. What it is used for I don't know, but what I do know is that it worked without it being plugged in. Been installed for days and it still locks and unlocks great!! Great buy! NAPA sells it for 50 bucks!!!"
5,Spot on.,The actuator appeared to be an exact match for the oem piece at a fraction of the cost. It works well so far. We will see if it holds up. Fingers crossed.
2,Failing,Installed four months ago and unit is now starting to fail. Spend a little more money and get a quality product.
