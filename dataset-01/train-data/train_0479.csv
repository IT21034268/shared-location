5,Best album of the 1990's,"You could compare Mezzanine to.... um..geez... well... um.... Purple Rain? um... Sgt Pepper? that's about it.... apart from Blue Lines.All I can say is that it's a toss-up between Mezzanine and Blue Lines as to which is the best album of the last 15 years.... I think Mezzanine has it.If there are any Americans who'd like to hear what innovation sounds like (i'm not talking about REM, Nirvana, Smashing Pumpkins, whatever) then listen to this album. Makes you ashamed to be American."
2,Overrated BoreFest,"Well if this is the best Massive Attack album, then I won't be buying any more. Nor is this a worthy example of trip-hop IMO.This is WAY overrated! I somehow missed out on Massive Attack back in the day, yet I listened to and loved Portishead, Hooverphonic, Morcheeba, Sneaker Pimps ""Becoming X"", etc.There are a few good tracks, but for the most part, it's a mish-mash. Maybe if these songs actually went somewhere and they were about half as long in length....repetitive running loops while a guy mumbles self aware hipster-speak gets dull fast. Ya know, getting a few decent female soul singers and a sequencer doesn't make a good record."
1,kids on casio keyboards,"I don't pay much attention to pop music. But, sadly, when I do I find little reason to change my habits. The praise lavished on these recordists made me curious, though I was utterly befuddled by this praise when I heard them. Their sound approximates a group of kids playing with casio keyboards in someone's basement. While certainly more creative than much of the drivel encountered on the pop scene, they are no more talented than a Britney Spears or N Sync--perhaps less so. Pardon me while I go back to listening to something that requires an ear for tone and rhythm."
5,An amazing album for any true audiophile.,"This is my first Massive Attack album and it certainly won't be my last! I love this album, the vocals, the lyrics and the audio engineering were perfect! My favorite songs are; Angel, TEARDROP, Man Next Door, TEARDROP, Black Milk, Dissolved Girl and Group Four.If you like jazz, hip-hop, rock n roll, and smooth enchanting female vocals then I definetly recommend this album.5 Stars and one of my all time favorites."
5,Mezzanine deserves an Mezza10.,"This album is the coolest one of all. Massive Attack outdone themselves. Music ranging from gothic dub ""Man Next Door"" to the light house bass dub ""Teardrop"". This album will make you shake and just go crazy. My favorite songs are:1. Man Next Door2. Teardrop3. Mezzanine4. Intertia Creeps5. Risingson6. ExchangeEven though ,I love the whole album!not many artists can make their album title song unique, but the track ""Mezzanine"" represents that this album is an Mezzanine with dark heavy beats. I mean it's totally cool. Massive Attack, keep up the good work, I hope you will stick with this kind of music for life. IM BEHIND MASSIVE ATTACK ALL THE WAY."
5,The greatest trip-hop album of all time,"This album is pure genius... from start to finish. It's amazing how the songs progress on the album to a sort of climax near the end. The song ""Mezzanine"" is my personal favorite, and I love how there is enough variety among songs for them to not all sound the same. The vocals are an amazing mix of beauty, mystery, and roughness, and the lyrics are poetic and dark. If you like Zero 7, Mono, or Portishead, this is a must. This is darker, less pop, and more interesting than some of Massive Attack's other stuff."
5,Warm darkness,"Brilliant samples and analog pulses combined with lovely vocals. This album is one of the best I ever bought and recommend everybody to buy it. You will be pleased because it will take you to strange dark lands and yet give you a very warm feeling inside. It is brilliant as an inspiration source for writing love letters (dutch loveletters that is, me not speek English verry well)."
4,super hot music!,"really cool driving music, chilling music.... anything music. the mixture of beats and vocals is amazing... they really got this down very well....cant wait to get more of tehir music. i give tehm 4 starts becasue only Pink Floyd gets 5."
3,Haunting,The first time I heard this album or so I thought was off the Matrix soundtrack but- further listening revealed tracks that I had been hearing in clubs and as background music for months. This CD can set a mood hard to get out of- trance like. Great for supporting those depressing rainy nights or a cozy evening with a one night stand. Just Kidding.
3,Massive Attack as we know them are gone.,"This album is much less diverse and interesting than the previous two. Despite the powerful presence of Liz Frazer, it seems that like fellow trip-hoppers Portishead, they became too self-indulged. It's a fair album, but not what I came to expect from a group like Massive Attack."
4,"Mellow, Mellow...captivating.","The album puts me in a trance at times. The fluidity of the melodies are so beautiful yet attenuated across a fine line...Crisp yet deeply textured. Be prepared: Do not concentrate fully but allow the music to ""happen"". The experience just ""is"". If you enjoy the stripped-down nature of bands like Tortoise or Stereolab yet tune in to the soulful style of the Digable Planets, buy this album."
5,Simply the best,"As soon as you have heard this masterpiece you will pity all those ignorant people who still believe Sgt. Pepper or Exile on Main Street are the best albums ever made. Why this has received so little praise from music critics is beyond me. Songs such as ""Risingson"" and ""Group Four"" are total perfection."
5,King of Triphop!,"This cd is one of my best cd's ever! Somebody wrote that it is cold, wel I love the cool ""Film-noir"" kinda feel, gives a lot of sensual tension. Somebody wrote it is almost lounche, I think this is lounche at its best, get used to some guitar riffs!I play this next to Miles Davis (Kind of Blue), D'Angelo (Voodoo), that kind of timeless, raw, smokey and roomfilling(=lounch) funky stuff."
5,What else can be said?,Nothing more can be said about this album....I am just voting to give it another 5 star boost.MYEAH
3,too much hype,"I wonder where all of these five star reviews are coming from. I guess I didn't dig on the vibe that was put out on this album. Mezzanine sounds line an updated Joy Division album that's trying too hard. A couple of the songs are downright funny, sometimes I felt like I was listening to two creepy old men trying to bust the most ridiculous freestyle. An average joint at best. If you want some hype downtempo give NOW's Carboot Soul or the Eighteenth Street Lounge soundtrack a try. one"
4,"flashes of brilliance, but not consistent","It's *almost* there, but not quite. The CD has tracks I'd be happy to buy as singles -- brilliant pieces like ""Angel"", ""Inertia Creeps"", and ""Teardrop"" among others make this CD one worth owning. However, it is not as consistent as one would like -- listening to it (as one tends to do at night, rather than day, with Massive attack) feels like flashes of light in the darkness. Those flashes are worth it, but the rest keeps the CD from being an all-out five-star buy.But then again, it is rare to come across a perfect, polished gem of a CD. Maybe I'm just being picky.This CD DOES rock, and you SHOULD buy it!"
3,One track album,"""Teardrop"" is a truly outstanding track on an album which is otherwise fairly mediocre. All the songs seem to start well, all leave me feeling empty. A one track album."
3,3 songs DESTROY this album,"The vocals on ""Rising Son"", Mezzanine"" and ""Inertia Creeps"" are absolutley atrocious. It amazes me that Massive Attack can reach such heights : ""Angel"", ""Man Next Door"" (both Horace Andy remakes from the 1970's) and ""Teardrop"" to the afore mentioned 3 disasters on one album. Obviously ego and yes-men allowed Del Naja to attempt to sing. The three triumphant racks nullify the disasterous vocals of the three tracks mentioned in the first sentance. Horace Andy is a master, Del Naja is a disaster."
5,Futuristic Perfection,"So there's this whole new trip-hop thing that everyone is so excited about. But Massive Attack transcend conventional music monikers and set forth one of the greatest albums of all time. This album is a big black metallic structure, full of throbbing synthesizers, ghostly vocals, and an overall mood of darkness. Songs like ""Teardrop"" showcase the band's skill for crafting hypnotic ballads with an ominous keyboard riff and a drumbeat that most resembles a ticking bomb. ""Interita Creeps"" and ""Mezzanine"" seem murderous, with their creepy lyrics and dark stormy intrumentations. Overall, this is a phenomenal album, full of atmosphere and heart."
4,"Brilliant, but difficult.","Elizabeth Frazer's vocals are just beautiful - it's worth the price of the CD just for ""Teardrop"". But a couple of songs, I have to fast forward through (""Inertia Creeps"", ""Mezzanine""), because they're just too dreary and weighted down. When the rest of their songs are lighter are more melodic, the music just shines. Hence the 4 stars instead of 5."
4,Well made set,"These hex key wrenches are high quality, and this set includes some half-millimeter sizes that other sets don't. Every wrench 3mm or larger is stamped with its size. The plastic case is elegant and compact and holds the wrenches snugly.The only flaw with this product is that the case is designed so that in order to remove a smaller wrench, you must remove or turn aside several larger ones. This is a little annoying when you just want, say, the 5mm wrench. It is possible to use the short arm of any wrench by turning it 90 and using the entire case as a handle."
5,tekton short arm metric hex wrench set,nice little storage bar. the wrench fit well and work well when there little clearance to work in. the wrenches appear to be finished well.
5,Buy the First one !,You know when heard this album was coming out I rushed to get it thinking if the first one was tight this one would really be tight but to my dissapointment i was wrong and regret buying the tape.There first tape left this big impression in my head so i thought this one would be the same i will say this though i do like them better than bone hoes in harmony.At least they didn't switch up there style and do some...for the other type of hip hop crowd (you know what i mean)!
4,It waz a pretty tight album,"It waz a pretty tight album with tracks like (Heads, Lil Sum Sum, Still Po Pimpin, Gangsta Shit, Bustin Back, Ultimate ShutDown and more) I've alwayz been a Rap-A-Lot fan and i think Do Or Die came out tight and now I'm waitin for there new album to come out"
1,bone wannabe's,"no talent. no originality.low quality. bunch of bone haters. everyone here should mosy on to the bone reviews, cause they're kinda similar, but better, and they're actually ORIGINAL."
2,KEEP IT COMMIN',I REALLY LIKE THESE GUYS EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NOT THE FASTEST RAPPERS THEY ARE STILL PRETTY GOOD EXPECIALLY WHEN THE COLABORATE WITH TWISTA. NOW HES TIGHT AS HELLA THAT BROTHA CAN RAP HELL FAST AND THATS WHY HE'S THE TIGHEST RAPPER EVER BECAUSE ALL THERE SONGS HAVE SOMTHING DIFFERENT ABOUT THEM SO WHEN YOU POP THIS CD IN YOUR PLAYER YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT THERE GONNA GIVE YOU.
2,PiTiFuL~!! DO NOT GET THIS~!!,"The first album I thought was their best work. This album is just pitiful. ""Bustin Back"" just shows how badd they are. All they talk about is shootin Bone and smokin. The beat is good and all but the song is pitiful. A third of the time, they're just mumbling. Listenin to the first one on the mic, at one part it sound like he just making noise. C'mon. To be honest to you, I think they're trying to be like Bone. They should just change their style. Bone don't got time to be dealing with Do or Die right now. ""Pimpology"" was my jam. It had an ok beat and it was chillin. ""Still Po Pimpin"" isn't better than the first one. But it was aight. Overall, this album is trash. Don't get it. Lucky for me, my cousin got all three of them instead of me. If you see this album in stores just walk away from it."
2,this was their only decent album,"This album gets 2 stars because it has a few DECENT (I dare not say good) songs on it, but for the most part, it's just pansy beats with pitiful rapping and poor attempts at singing. Do or Die has nothing to offer; they just want to show up Bone Thugs and after listening to what is supposedly their best album, it's quite obvious why they haven't."
4,Kool....,"This cd is really good. Do Or Die's first joint ""Picture this"" was a dope cd with the soft chi-town, Midwest style...I think ""Picture this"" is a classic but Headz Or Tailz is a really good second cd by the two brothers and their best friend...their rap style is fast and Do Or Die are lyrical monsters spitting out rhymez like machines...they are verbaly good and I hope that they will record a 4:th album...I listen to them often and I never get sick by songs like:Pimpology, Still Po Pimpin, Can I, Dead Or Alive, Ultimate shutdown...Headz Or Tailz is great...only a few songs are bad and if you like MidWest Rap I really think you should by one of Do Or Die's 2 first albums...This one got more songs on it so maybe you get more for the money if you buy this one...Peace Out..."
5,purchase,trying to collect all my old school music. Glad I found what i was looking for. Thank you so much
3,Interesting subject,Book was enlightening; although i don't really know how accurate subject matter is. The illustrations were sub par. Looked like they came from a printer running out of ink. Not enough subject matter if you ask me; book was too short a read.
5,"Truely a Black History Book (If you are Christian, please read this book)","This book is a must read for all people. Not only for people of African descent but for all.As an African American and a Christian, I must say that this book answers so many questions for me. Qhestions that I have had since childhood.After much searching, digging and asking, and after reading ""The Hebrew Heritage of Black Africa"" I now know beyond a doubt that we (African Americans)are the people of the book. (The Holy Bible). I could say alot more, but you must read this book for yourself and draw your own conclusions.""The Hebrew Heritage of Black Africa"" is well written, well researched, and easy to read. Please read this book. You will never be the same.""Know the truth and the truth shall make you free"" (John 8:32)"
1,Fits tall 8 oz. bottles but falls apart quickly,"The bag looks nice from the outside and fits Dr. Brown's tall 8 oz. bottles perfectly. But after 3 months of medium usage, the inside lining split on one side. I tried to super glue it, which worked for a couple weeks but then it split apart again. Then the other side split apart after about 5 months. Not very sturdy. Also, you need a second ice pack in order for the formula to stay cold enough.I wish Dr. Brown's would come up with a better quality, longer-lasting bag--I would be willing to pay more if they could come up with something that lasts longer than 3 months."
1,received wrong item,"received the wrong item and after almost 30 days still have not received the correct items that were ordered, vendor slow to respond to correspondence, would not buy anything from this vendor again"
1,"Sugar Water, with some rubberry jelly.","I have grown up with coconut trees around and drinking the original. This is certainly not even close to a coconut water. Its a sugar water with some rubber like artificial jelly in them. I bought it a local grocery store, and thought it would nice.Well the ingredient did say ""Water,sugar and jelly added"". My bad i read it after i bought it in hurry."
1,Short snippets of many Rebbe's.,The information was enough so that you understood how dedicated these leaders and their students were to study and living what they firmly believed. I recommend it.
3,Other Masters compilations are stronger,"If you want a Masters Apprentices greatest hits compilation (a great idea, they were an amazing band) pay the extra three dollars and get Hands of Time instead of this one. For the extra $ you'll get 12 more tracks."
3,"Great acting, muddy sound","As others have stated, the program itself is great - just has bad sound. Our Samsung TV has a sound option for ""clear voice"" that helps a lot."
2,Disappointed,"Never got the DVD I WAS SEND A REGION 2 DVD, WHICH WILL NOT PLAY IN USA DVD'S. I SENT IT BACK TO MARS, BUT HAVE NOT RECEIVED A REPLACEMENT DVD."
2,"horrible dvds, totally broken and unlinked storyline","don't know what's going on with these three dvds, the storyline of at the end of each dvd is a broken link that simply fails to connect with the next one. worthless 3 pcs of junk. the book is a slow tempo book with deadbeat narrative speed, then the dvds seem to surpass the slowliness of the book. given 4 to 5 stars? you must have very creative imagination of at least 2 extra dvds :)"
5,Story telling just doesn't get any better than this,"This is a beautiful production. As a fan of the book, this series doesn't disappoint. And, in particular, watching Smiley come to life through Alec Guinness' portrayal is nothing but pure pleasure to experience."
2,Very disappoiting DVD release,"I loved this story after reading the book and when I first saw it on PBS. So I went and bought the BBC cassette version tapes from amazon UK years ago. I worked at an ad agency and was able to get the PAL tapes transferred to US VHS. I watched it many time and was very disappointed to see how this DVD version has been butchered. As I learned from an IMDB review at least 40 minutes have been cut and many scenes simply make little sense without the background material that was cut. Many of the music accents have been cut also (case: when George find the cigarette package in the tree). I have no idea if the original cut is still available, perhaps the BBC DVD version for sale has the original but I'd buy a multi-region player and get that version before buying this one."
2,Review Smiley's People,This DVD version has too much of the original program deleted. Had I never seen the original it wouldn't have mattered but the deleted parts added a lot to the story continuity. Like all John LeCarre stories with the plots and sub plots any deleted information detracts from the story.
5,Nice drop in price and hard to add anything new to other 5-star reviews.,"I agree with the vast majority of 5-star reviews including the comments re the quality - slight lack thereof - of the transfer and the deletion of some scenes. But these minor quibbles do not result in a less-than-5 star rating. And I enthusiastically and whole-heartedly agree that this is one of the top 10 BBC productions of all-time taking its place with TTSS, Jewel In The Crown, Brideshead etc. I find it hard to envision a top quality DVD collection without this masterpiece or TTSS. These two are for the ages. Nice decrease in price also."
5,One of my All-Time favorites,"Simply a classic in great acting with a plot that keeps you truly engaged. The twists and turns of the novel are faithfully followed, making it a treasure that can be watched over and over again."
5,Fantastic and Riveting,"This is the sequel to ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy,"" which you should really watch first. When John Le Carre wrote these novels the Cold War was at its height and Britain was thoroughly disgraced by scandalous Soviet infiltration of its intelligence agencies. Nobody trusted British intelligence because moles had been discovered inside the Service. All of that is true history, and forms the back drop to this series. The BBC got the rights to Le Carre's two classics, and after Tinker/Tailor proved phenomenally successful in UK and USA, they put more money into the production of ""Smiley's"". Give yourself a treat: settle in for a marathon and watch the entire thing at once. Amazing. It's too bad they don't make TV movie series like this any more ---- WAY better than ""24""."
3,disc problem,The program is excellent. But one program was so dark we could hardly see what was happening. That shouldn't be the case.
5,I have watched this DVD at least once a month for years.,"I am addicted to this film. Alec Guinness is amazing.I keep finding reasons to give it as a gift to people... Like I'm trying to woo them into the cult of Smiley. I can't put my finger on one reason that it's so outstanding--there are so many. The acting is superb. The cinematography is careful, the photography is innovative at the right moments. The story is addictive. The music is intoxicating.You will love it!"
3,missing parts of several scenes,"A wonderful production of the novel, but the DVD edition has parts of several scenes missing. They are not essential pieces of the story, but still significant. It was disappointing.Some parts missing were:The conversation between Smiley and Endeby (sp?) in the ""garden"".Part of the conversation between Guillam and Smiley in the Imbiss.The end of the conversation between Smiley and Cretchmar (sp?) at the Blue Diamond.I think that a small part at the end of the scene with Karla was also cut.Still the DVD set is wonderful; this review is to register the poor job done by the publisher."
1,They don't work,"Hi,I just purchased the breaker and when tried to use it did not work. One of the poles was defective.Ordered a replacement, and Amazon sent me a new one right away, but unfortunately, it came with the same problemSo, not going to risk for a 3rd defective breaker and asked for a refund instead.Connecticut Electric should test their breakers before the put them in the market.It is quite annoying!"
5,Luke Kelly The Performer,"I received this in the mail yesterday and highly recommend it to all who love Luke & Irish music. It is fantastic, just fantastic."
1,Dont waste your money!,"A total diasappointment;anything but usefull!. You can derive uncomparably higher benefit from, say, Harrap's two volume general English-French dictionnaries at much lower cost even for your technical needs."
4,Fairly easy to install,"I didn't get to use them much, but the little bit I did, they worked well. Installed in about 5 minutes. The only problem was the sizing. If they would have been just a little bit bigger, they would not have worked. I probably could have used the next size smaller and been better off. The case they come in is just a little tool small. It's like sitting on the suitcase to get it closed."
4,A few Words From a Long Term User,"Unlike some of the other reviews, this one is specific to this product and to the point. I've used these cables for over a year on my Saturn in Big Bear, CA. Installation is pretty easy with just a little practice. No readjusting after installation; a real plus. Be careful not to spin the tire on acceleration; the hook on the inside can release and the chain will pop off. The rubber tightener is cracked, but has not broken; makes me nervous. The traction coils are wearing well, even with quite a lot of bare-pavement driving. The side cables appear to be untwisting, making the whole unit prone to knotting itself up and more difficult to install, (after a lot of use.) These cables have destroyed my plastic hub caps. Despite some problems, these cables are superior to conventional chains and I would buy them again."
4,Love and Hate Them,"I have used them once so far. Quality is good and they do work well, but it's a pretty rough ride on cleared roads. They are a pain to put on and not quite so bad to take off, but plan on getting full of snow as you put them on or take them off. Put a set in your trunk along with a good pair of gloves and avoid using them if at all possible. But if you get caught away from home and really need to get back after a snow storm, they are wonderful. Also, if you use them in salt conditions, be sure to rinse them off and hang them up to dry before putting them away or they will rust. Doubt if it hurts anything, but the rust stains look bad. I would also recommend putting them on sometime before you need to so that you get a feel for what all is involved. Much of my frustration could have been avoided if I had tried them on in better weather before I actually needed them."
2,Cable Chains Slip on Pavement,"I installed the cable chains (Security Chain Co., SZ339 Shur Grip) on front drive wheels of my car. I tried to drive up a moderate slope asphalt paved drive with some snow and ice. The drive tires spun on the asphalt and never gained traction even after repeated slow controlled starts. I removed the chains and drove up the asphalt drive with no problem except for some minor slipping on the ice and snow. On reason for the failure could be the cable chain design. The cross cables have wire rings which just spin on the bare asphalt and never gained traction. Very disappointing! On the positive side: Amazon's return policy and process was great."
2,Cheap plastic gloves,The gloves included with my set were not the ones shown in the demo video but rather cheap clear plastic ones. Tacky advertising to show something in the demo not included in the kit.
3,Good product,Good product but the company that shipped it is not very good. Great for when you are stuck in the snow.
3,Very tricky install & uninstall,"I had great trouble getting these on and off a 2007 Ford Focus. The tire had sunk a little bit the day before into now frozen icy snow, and as such the clearance around the tire was restricted -- not by much but there is very little clearance to work with when attaching. It was most aggravating. After chipping away at the ice around the tire, I finally got it on, but it did not bode well for the times I would have even less favorable conditions.I also tried the Z Chain -- easier to install given the extra wiggle room, but on the uninstall it got tied up behind the wheel given the tight clearances. I got real dirty on that one. Perhaps if you kept your car garaged it would be an easier set up -- but in my location install happens outside and then removing them will undoubtedly happen in an unplowed parking lot at best. I'm going to invest in Thule K Summit system."
4,Easy Install and Tight fit with included Tensioners.,"Make sure you go to SCC's website and watch the install video and use/download their tire size cross reference chart for correct fit. I compared at other sites and they didn't always list the correct item for my tires. This version installed easily and tightened up well with the INCLUDED rubber tensioners. I haven't needed to use them yet, but did a test fit to make sure. I can see where clearance to the running gear/wheel well could be an issue with non cable-chains and no tensioner, but these are about as snug to the wheel as you can get. I bought two sets for my 4wd while they were on sale."
1,Didn't Work,"One of these chains popped off of my car in a massive snow storm, leaving me stranded.When I replaced this chain, I checked to see if the other was secure. It was. This chain also popped off.I was very VERY careful when putting the chain on my car. (I used a system of checks and balances with my significant other) There seemed to be no defect. Perhaps the actual sizing was wrong.I would NEVER recommend this to anyone, as I know it put me in a very dangerous situation.They are also VERY expensive, and the company I bought them from would not give me ANY refund."
3,"If I Wanted Santana, I Would Have Bought Santana!","The first two cuts on this CD have nothing to do with the make-up of this Benson revival. It seems as though Vega's influence in the production of these two cuts was an attempt to tap in to Santana's recent celebrity. ""The Ghetto"" and ""El Barrio"" ruin the continuity of the CD. I copied the CD and edited out the first two cuts. What a difference ... much better!"
1,For collector's only Fire Ambulance,"This is a terrible choice for a toy. The cab is die cast metal but the rest including the undercarriage is completely plastic and is therefore very easily broken. It will not hold up if you let your children play with it. When my son broke his within a couple of hours, there were many small pieces (can anyone say choking hazard!!!). If you are a collector however, put it on the shelf and don't let anyone touch it."
1,Is this supposed to be about pregnancy?,"I am recently pregnant and so thought what a great book. Wrong!!! You never get to the baby part although the front of the nicely displays bottles. The author obviously knows nothing about all parnoias that pregnant women have today. She is eating pate somewhere in the book a big no-no for pregnant women. I just skimmed through the last half of the book and was so happy when it was finished. I agree with the other reviews. I just could not get into the main character, nor her friends. If you are pregnant, I would not read this book. I will only depress you."
1,this writer needs a new editor ...,"Like the others who have reviewed this book, I couldn't get over how many typos were in it on top of the horrifically bad plot. The description from the publisher doesn't even come close to the plot. It says Jack is her ""best male friend"". I didn't get that vibe at all. I have to finish every book I start (it's a sickness, really), and this was the most painful book I've read. Don't bother buying it. If someone gives it to you, they're not your friend!"
3,pass it on?,"It was really hard to get into. About half way through the book I started liking it.It was too long and could have been shortened by many many pages.This was the first book I read by this author, and I don't think I'll read another by her."
1,"Awful, Depressing, Flat","I have never given a bad review to a book before, but this is by FAR the worst ""chick lit"" book I have ever read. The characters are selfish, boring, and cold, the storyline is inconsistent, and yes, the typos are hard to get over. Every other description is ""snapped"" - as in Anna ""snapped"" at her friends/fiance/self. Terrible!I found the book to be so dull that I could not even finish it!The worst part is the overblown language - encumbered, incomprehension, instaneously, impetuous - and these were all on ONE page.Don't waste your money. If you want light, fun reading, this book is Not for you."
1,Joyless from Start to Finish,"Why did Holly Chamberlin decide to write such a miserable book? I agree with some of the other reviewers that all of the main characters were soulless, including Anna, who seemed to approach her pregnancy with the sort of enthusiasm one approaches root canal. And why are all of the supporting characters so mean and nasty? From the cranky ob-gyn, the indifferent fiancee who wouldn't go to the doctor with her, and Anna's uncaring mother--there wasn't a single nice person in the entire book! Even the bit characters--like the people on the street who scolded Anna for having an attack of morning sickness in public. Wouldn't someone have tried to help her or ask if she was all right? It seems rather unrealistic that every single person in the story was suffering from eternal PMS!"
1,"Redundant, slow and flat. No substance!","I didn't enjoy this read really; it's like a bad phone conversation with someone you could just slap for being utterly boring and unbelievably repetitive.For me this was like a mass of questions repeating themselves in a monotonous way.The only surprise of the book is that if you think you will be reading of a woman who has to change to accommodate a new life in her live, it just won't be so since she looses the baby with a natural miscarriage and her life changes like everyone else's does but there is no baby here.I found this book dull and the characters aside from Alexandra, Anna's best friend are unimaginative and terribly flat. I cannot recommend it since it is not even a light frothy read it's just a bad story"
1,"What was the story about, exactly?","Like some of the other reviewers, I had a hard time getting into this story, it was too hard to follow and there was no development at all. Was it about an unplanned pregnancy, an unhappy relationship, her crazy in-laws, her friends, dysfunctional family? There was just too much going on and it made it all confusing. I didn't even notice the typos!!!"
1,Don't Bother,"Usually I enjoy most ""chick lit"" books, however this one was almost impossible to read. Normally I would finish a book like this in one night but it took me days to read this book because I found it so hard to like Anna and really care about her. Mostly I just thought she was really shallow. Also, none of the supporting characters were even likeable. I couldn't find a single reason to care about how the book ended but I have a rule that I have to finish the current book I am reading before I can start a new one so I had to force myself to finish the book. I don't like to give bad reviews but I absolutely cannot recommend this book to anyone else. Happy Reading!!"
5,Don't be misled by the title,"I overlooked this book for years because it sounded like a self-help fixit. After I actually started reading it, i was bombarded by the wisdom shown on every page. Dr. Richards has placed his finger on the biggest source of pain we ever experience and he very simply describes the Biblical solution. I highly recommend it."
5,It Stopped!,This book / author reveals so much insight and depth into 'how to' recover from life issues and pain. I will give this to everyone to read.
4,Good Informational Book,The book is sound in what the author offers. If it is put into practice it can be the tool that will assist in setting a person free from the cycle of pain and help in correcting thought pattern that is destructive Great help .
3,Mixed Reaction,"I just finished the book, and I thought the author made some excellent points. Unfortunately, I don't agree with him on his main point that we are never to judge people. I believe we are called to make righteous judgments (John 7:24) in the right spirit. After we have taken the plank out of our own eye, we are able to see clearly to take the plank out of our brother's eye (Matt 7:5). This must be done in great humility and with the right spirit.The author makes a great point in giving people the benefit of the doubt when they have offended you. His recommendation to talk to the individually directly after a conflict to discuss the situation instead of letting offense fester is superb."
5,Incredible Insight - very helpful,"The topic of judging others and its fruit is a bit tough to ""own"" but I've found that my judgements have impacted every area of my life. Walking free of the need to judge others and even myself has been liberating.I highly recomend this book.Pastor Ed Johnsonlaklandbelieverschurch.com"
5,Love this book,"Excellent read! Really helps you examine yourself in how we judge others , ourselves and especially how we past judgement on God."
4,SCHOLARLY WORK ABOUT AN INTELLIGENT BREED OF HOUND,"This book is an excellent comprehensive work about the technical aspects of beagle care. The sections on breeding, ailments and general health care are covered in clear, crisp detail; the technical information that was once privy to vets, breeders and other groups is now accessible to all with an interest in this lively, intelligent little hound.This work is a compliment to the intelligence of its readers; it gives good, in-depth information without lagging or losing pace.The photographs are superb and this is certainly something that will either pique one's interest in beagles or for those who own beagles, appreciate their lively, spirited little hounds all the more."
4,MMmmmm,The disk is really good. The songs on the CD are really romantic and I can relate to the artists. The CD was in great condition.
1,NOT COMPLETE!!!,"I am SUPER pissed that I got this CD and it does NOT include 'Can't Have Nuthin'( one of their few hits that got radio time ) and 'I Will Love You Anyhow'.I do not know why my cassette has these two songs and the CDs do not offer them, but I am mad as hell. This is only 11 songs and is missing one of their hits...beware."
4,Exciting!,"This handbook is a must for anyone in supervision. While providing sound advise and useful tips, this handbook simplifies strategies for a successful supervisor."
1,MISPRINTING!!!!!,"The book is nicely made; the story's all there...but every set of quotation marks is misprinted. It's maddening. At the beginning of every character's speech, the quotation marks appear BELOW the word, instead of at the top left. ,,Like this!"" I bought the book for young readers, so I'm returning it. ,,Right now!""I didn't pick up on it, but you can actually see the misprinted quotation marks right on the front cover: ,,Alice"""
2,"Missed the Boat, Indeed. I Still Love Me Some Isaac Brock Though","""We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank"" (<--- boo, 1 and 1/2 stars).""The Moon and Antartica"" (<--- Heck yes! lots of stars).""The Lonesome, Crowded West"" (<---Heck yes again! lots of stars..again)."
5,Great album,"This album is classic, start to finish. All songs have it's own distinct unique, creative sound contributing to a masterpiece of an album."
4,Good music!,"Like most other Modest Mouse records, this is an excellent disc, if erratic. It hits on most songs though, and I like it. It's more poppy than their previous releases, but I still think it's a good sound. Four stars."
1,Oh no?,"What in tarnation is this?Why do all these new bands gotta play this ""Theater Music?""What happened to rock and roll? And life?The Lonsome Crowded West. I can deal with that and have dealt with it for many years. It's pretty sweet. But it is still Modest Mouse. And that old Modest Mouse sound. Hey. Here we are, we're Modest Mouse.I skipped the last album...too much to do, but hoped this one might have been fresher. It sounds like Franz Fredinand. And that is palin awful.Do all of these bands like Franz, Mouse, Arcade Fire all get togeather and decide to make the worst music ever made?Hey. Let's all be the worst.Well they deifnetly have made an awful album and if that's what they were up to. My hats are off to them.Have fun cathing them on tour. Don't bring a date. Because they will just get angry and think you are a big jerk. Why did you subject me to this?"
1,Stonedgoose,"Drivel.........absolutely drivel! If the wax build-up in your ears isn't vibrated loose by the sound emanating from the speakers which are wantinly attempting to commit suicide.....MM is definitely one of the worst if not the worst album I've purchased in the last year. There isn't a sniff of a melody here, nor will your hear one. Somewhere people fell on the bandwagon for a band that produced garbage and felt taken advantage of and then convinced others of their misjudging. Do yourself a HUGE favor, redirect towards the like of Muse or Blueline Medic, your taste bud will be thanking you and as will your ears."
4,I think I'd call this better than their last album,"A lot of hype after the first CD made so much noise, and this new CD is a good followup."
3,Good buy minus one little scratch,"I bought this item ""like new"" assuming the cd would be scratch and skip free, but unfortunately it skips on the last song every time. I can deal with the one scratch for the price though."
2,"I'm at it again. This CD more than deserves to be thrown out, or just forgotten. >_<","This is the second time I'm listening to these crazy songs. This CD is sporadic at best. Sometimes it's quiet and calm, next the lead singer is screaming his head off.I don't see the appeal in this type of approach to the music that we've come to know as art, but I'm giving it a 2 because of course, most rap and country CDs are unlistenable so this one is OK. I guess. >_>2.2 stars."
1,Not the same band,"This album isn't in the same league as Modest Mouse's other work. I'm not the kind of guy who thinks that every bands first album is better or that all bands sell out, but this is far more mainstream than anything modset mouse has released. The song Dashboard pretty much sums this album up. It's catchy, but there's nothing to it. Every other modest mouse album is incredible, but this one is weaker in every respect. I don't even think I'd consider it modest mouse."
3,"Eh, you know, there it is again","I'll admit it, I'm not the biggest Modest Mouse fan. I just can't get over the fact that all their songs sound the same. Same type of music, same vocal quality and vocal rythym. I don't know, it just get's boring to me.However, I was entertained by the ""March Into the Sea."" I'm not sure why decided to sing like a crazed french pirate, but my compliments to him for that.I also like ""Missed the Boat."" James Mercer really kicked that song up a bit.For more of the same of what I've just said, read my review of ""Good News for blah blah blah."""
3,All good things...,"...must end. Maybe it's the fame and the money, maybe life's not so hard anymore. Either way it pains me to put Modest Mouse on the ever growing list of great bands gone...not bad. Remember the first time you heard The Lonesome Crowded West? You will never feel that way again, not with this band."
2,New Directions,"Modest Mouse changed for this album, and while there are a couple good songs, don't get it if you like the older Modest Mouse or are attached to their EP Everywhere and His Nasty Parlour Tricks. The two singles are good, but other songs drag and sometimes things just sound bad. Maybe if they were recorded differently I would listen to them."
3,Something a little different for me.,"There are a few songs that I love on this album, but I'm wondering how often I'll be listening to it a year or two from now."
1,Worst Vinyl Ever (i love modest mouse),"I am completely dissatisfied with this purchase. I buy lots of records and i have never experienced this shoddy of craftsmanship the songs skip in really weird places even though there is no visible damage on the record. Its would seem that the needle is actually sliding out of the grooves. (this is not a player error, as ive been listening to all my other records successfully.)I wish this record worked, and my trust with amazon had not been shattered."
5,Give a listen a least 3 times before you judge,"Great album. It gets better the more you listen. Its actually on the level of The Lonesome Crowded West in that it has so much variety and unique sound. Spitting Venom is already one of my favorite MM songs of all time. Although I thought Dashboard is the only skippable song on the album it makes up for it with the video. Other favorite songs are Steam Engines and Parting of the Sensory. Johnny Marr former Smiths Guitarist and James Mercer's ""The Shins"" vocals really add a new depth the the already ecclectic MM sound. FTRADIO!"
3,Where does this cd stand compared to others before it?,"Based on the previous reviews, most of which are biased by diehard longtime fans or first time listeners, people either hate this album or love it. My MM experience is scattered throughout several albums starting with ""This Is a Long Drive..."" and I can say MM is pretty hit and miss. Some songs are definitely skip worthy and others need to be repeated, thus ""We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank"" is no different. Its not a huge breakthrough album nor bottom feeder, highlights include: parting of the sensory, dashboard (which sounds nothing like the rest of the cd and is like the float on of ""Good News...""), we've got everything, education, missed the boat, and spitting venom. It's a very average cd, Modest Mouse is more of an acquired taste and not for everybody, for new listeners I recommend trying previous albums."
3,Modest Offering,"Modest Mouse is a favourite of mine. I find them to be different and quite entertaining.This album is just so-so compared to their others. It gets better with every listen as a good disc should, but it doesn't have the power or grip of the last two.At least it's still better than 90% of the music released this year."
4,Likin it,"I have always like this band, this was my first purchase of their music, and I love it! Glad I own it!"
2,bah... another great band that's lost it's touch,I used to be a big Modest Mouse fan but these last 2 albums have been getting worse and worse. This album has a few songs on it I like but the rest is just filler. Easily one of their very worst albums imo.
2,Worst Modest Mouse CD yet.,I am a Modest Mouse fan. I love every single song off of every single album EXCEPT this one. This album moves away from what makes Modest Mouse so great. It was a disappointment. I hope they can redeem themselves. I know they have it in them.
2,a penny covered in shit,"When I heard dashboard i thought that i might cry when i heard the rest of the cd. I didnt. I did not feel anything listening to the cd. Dont get me wrong i like the lonesome crowded west, long drive, M&A;, and enven good news. this cd is not good news even. If you are liked M&A;, and lonesome crowded dont buy this. get your friend to burn it for you, listen to it once and then listen to lonesome crowded west and drink a beer. Then forget what you heard, it wont be hard.To be honest i like parts of some some songs, but its not near as good as the older stuff and not even good enough to keep me listening to it."
4,revealing,"This book is neither an uncritical appraisal of Kennedy nor a damning account. Rather, the author has managed to give a critical but not biased view of Kennedy's presidency. Naturally, this involves disproving a couple of myths about ""Camelot"". I had to read this book for a university course about Kenndey's presidency and can recommend it to anyone interested in a fair account."
4,spooks,I was very interested in how animals can sense strange things where humans can't. Animals are amazing and we humans should take more notice of them and their abilities.
5,Good Stuff! Keeps you Watching,I wathced the show and found the content very interesting and entertaining. I recommend this to anyone who likes to hear stories about spooky stuff. It's worth the time to watch!
3,Paranormal Series from Animal Planet,"This is a good set to have if you're into paranormal goings-on. This series, which I believe is a spin-off of the ""A Haunting"" series (which is NOT based on Animal Planet), is pretty good. I still feel the storytelling and reenactments are better in the A Haunting series. If you are going to buy just one of the two, get A Haunting and forgo this one. The A Haunting ones are scarier and creepier, too!"
3,Over-analytical,"Ever feel like chucking your career, and following your true calling as a psychologist? Then you may be one of the select few who will find pleasure in this book. Every event that transpires, every word that is uttered, every facial expression, must be dissected by the narrator, to the point where the plotting dissolves into mush. There are those, I see, who managed to find humor in the endless babble. But I recommend this book to you, reader, only if you are very, very patient."
1,Disappointing,These glasses lookes nice in pictures only. When I opened the box of glasses i was totally disappointed with the quality and I decided to return the glasses immediately. Paint on the glasses is not at all good.
1,poorly designed cable,"The ""snagless"" feature is great because it won't snag when pulling out of a nest of cables. That said, it gets in the way of plugging into a switch or device. I found it very difficult (had to use a screw driver to release the RJ-45 latch) to release the latch by pressing down on the top of the ""snagless"" feature. I would not purchase these cables again because of the poor design.I have otherwise found the products from Cables to Go (C2G) to be well made, but not this product."
4,little-known gem,"Prairie Oyster is off the radar in the States--which is too bad for the band, and what could be a large fan base here. One listen to this group and you can tell that they would list ""Don't Worry"" by Marty Robbins as one of their favorite songs. I first heard P.O. because I picked up this cassette from the free bin at my local used record store, which I now consider one of the more profound serendipitous acts of my life. Well written, sung and played, this is a record which will make you want to both hoe-down and cry in your beer."
4,Old time country album,"This group is a wonderful blend of different influences that come together in an old time country/rock sound. Each song can motivate you to get up and dance or pickup that old guitar that's been collecting dust in the corner and play along. It's just one of those albums where everything comes together for an enjoyable experience. If you like country and want to dance or just play along, this one has everything you need. Although this is the only album I have of this group, I'll be looking for others and can only hope the next few are as good or Lord help me, even better."
3,Decent JSDK2EE tutorial but not a EJB Reference,"This is a good EJB tutorial introduction. It is well written and accurate. Complete examples are given and all the code is on the CD (though not the ""tons"" advertized on the cover). If you are new to EJB and like to learn by example, read this book and then pass it on. However, much of the book is specific to Sun's J2SDKEE (V1.2.1) application server and the remainder is not organized in a way that makes it useful as a reference. The index is weak and the section titles refer to the sample apps not the technical content. JMS and MDB are not covered."
3,Too much coverage of the App Deployment Tool,"This book is ok... it will give you an understanding of EJB's... but that's it. If you want to know anything about the XML configuration files, EAR files, or WAR files, you will be forced to look elsewhere. Basically, the code presented is the same thing over and over again, with the Application Deployment Tool settings changed. The book is jammed packed with images of the App Dep Tool settings... space I think would be much better filled with either more thorough examples, or info on the XML files. If you only want a very cursory look at EJBs this book is for you."
4,awesome pop vocals,"Vocaly, I'd say Charlotte's voice is a mix of Aselin Debison, Chantal Kreviazuk, Mandy Moore, Joni Mitchell, and Tori Amos.Most of the songs on the album are good - though my personal favorites are Sweet Chariot, Beautiful Life, and Wild Horses. Charlotte wrote the lyrics to most of the songs on the album, and, when you read the lyrics, you can tell which songs are more radio friendly. For example, I think On Your Shore - the first track - is the worst writen song on the album."
3,"Great talent, but not enough to hold my attention.","I enjoy ""Steel"". Other than that, this album is OK. Miss Martin has amazing piano skills, and her voice is pretty, but her lyrics just don't make me care. This is too bad. She has everything else, but she lacks the true heart and emotion of being a powerful singer-songwriter. I still recommend it over anything on the top 40. If you don't like the more intense, lyrically challenging female musicians, Charlotte is a lighter alternative. Overall, the album is quite listenable, it just doesn't move me."
2,Stock up on her influences first,"I'm such a big fan of Tori Amos and Kate Bush that I gave this album a chance to grow on me and really, really tried to like Charlotte too. The problem is she sounds like such a knockoff of her influences all I can hear is her copycat style, no true depth or originality. No offense to her fans but sorry, I have to agree with the minority here and say she needs to develop a little more of her own musical identity and stop sounding like her mentors. If you think you like Charlotte but don't have all of Tori and Kate's work in your library yet, I suggest you start there. For now, I'll give Charlotte two stars for potential."
2,Marketing Department Dream:,"1 Part Kate Bush1 Part Tori Amos1 Part Good looksmix in a blender, then liberialy waterdown the remains, sprinkle on some semi-pseudo-intellectual lyrics and then bake until full burned onto the CD. Your now the proud owner of Charlotte Martin's ""On Your Shore"". A perfect companion for the second term of G Bush new moral conservatism, where safe is success and complexity is a dirty word.This is not to say the music here is not better then 90% of her mainstream peers. But on your next CD, Charlotte you need to hike-up those low-rider jeans, for your influences are showing a little to much, and create something uniquely yours to become a true artist."
5,Embarks on an emotional voyage...,"Confessional and conflicted, Martin's piano-driven masterpiece embarks on an emotional voyage. Her edgy lyrics and intricate melodies tackle hidden demons causing an eerie sense of self-deprecation. Martin's vulnerability is the underlying beauty that brings ""On Your Shore"" to a level of musical excellence that leaves no room for compare. [VTeens.Org]"
1,Severely Copy Protected,"It's funny. I bought this CD from Amazon on my computer. But because of the copy protection, I can't even play it on the machine I purchased it with. Worthless. I'll never buy another RCA or BMG disc."
2,Talented but so what.,"If I wanted a Tori Amos album, I would buy a Tori Amos album. I think an artist can go a little too far with imitating their influences. You must be in there somewhere Charlotte Martin. I just didn't hear it on this album."
2,"If you like Tori, think twice about this one","I bought this CD as a Tori fan, as I had heard from reviews that this album had the same rawness and piano style. What a letdown.While Charlotte's voice and piano playing should automatically put her in a rank above her competition, the lack of self-reflection, honesty or depth in her lyrics turned me off. Very little originality. Some have compared her lyrics to being as ""quirky"" as Tori's, and the only line in which I see that is, ""Could lip gloss save a nation Mr. Powers?"" which seems ripped off (she even lists Tori in her credits, and any fan knows about Tori's obsession with lip gloss). I agree with another review under this album: if I wanted to listen to superficial lyrics, there is a plethora of junk out there.On a positive note, I did enjoy ""Wild Horses."" Oh wait, that is a cover of the Rolling Stones song. I read somewhere that Charlotte was an opera singer; so why is she cacaphonously pronouncing ""horses"" like ""hors-iz""?"
2,total Tory Amos clone,"I suppose if you are a Tory Amos fan you might like this because it sounds like a lip-sync of her stuff, but myself, I'm looking for individual style in each artist. I couldn't detect a style that was ""Charlotte"" in any of these songs. Musically competent but lacks innovation of any kind."
2,Dumbed-Down Version of Tori Amos,"Part of what makes Tori Amos so amazing is her obscure lyrics. If you can't handle that, then you should LOVE Charlotte Martin. Charlotte Martin seems more easily marketable. Good for her, but Tori sells millions without seeming all that marketable. Comparisons to Tori will probably kill Charlotte."
4,on MY shore,"not a bad little cd. Nowadays getting an album with at least 3 good songs on it is a score. she is like a more rock based tori amos, but not a knock off. Individual and unique. Not an amazing ALBUM , but has some great songs on it. DO IT!"
1,Fake reviews,"I don't have this External Mobile drive. I'm just here to let you all know look out for the fake reviewer. Notice he or her also reviewed the same products by the same company. Yep, ya guessed it. They also have 5 stars."
5,Catherine Cookson DVD's,I was extrememly pleased with my latest purchase of DVD's on Catherine Cookson. It was better then I even imagined.
4,Ideal present for wife,Keeps the wife happy with plenty of DVDs to keep her occupied whilst I am at work during the week
1,Terribel acting,I was really looking forward to this based on the reviews but I have watched 3 discs and have not enjoyed them for the most part. Some of the acting is simply terrible.
2,LOST INTEREST,"While this movie had the potential for being a better movie,and I could see why some would enjoy the story, it was hard for me to stay interested. I lost interst when the male star entered into the army. For some reason I found the rest of the movie less than what I wanted to watch. The actors are very good. The only problem I found was the story line. Wish I had known more about the movie before purchasing the movie."
3,"Good story, but not enough depth...","Entertaining, but somewhat boring. Great acting, costumes, editing...just seemed like something was missing."
2,Cord too short,I bought this griddle yesterday and returned it today. The cord is very short. This is one LARGE griddle and it takes up space. A little longer cord would have allowed the griddleto be placed as needed on the counter for safe cooking. I would have kept this griddle IF the cord had been longer.
2,Don't buy for cooking pancakes,"I received this as a present for my birthday because I wanted a bigger grill to cook more pancakes simultaneously. It's size is large enough to cook four or five 3 ounce pancakes.The grill does not heat evenly. Pancakes do not cook evenly, either individually or as a group. The pancake nearest the heating control overcooks and usually ends up nearly burnt. The other pancakes are cooked over the narrow heating element (look on the bottom and you will see the heating element). The griddle does not transfer the heat from the heating element adequately. The portion of the pancakes over the heating element is nicely brown but the rest of the pancake is white. Someone said striped. That is an accurate description.I like my pancakes to be evenly cooked and nicely brown. This griddle does neither. I do NOT recommend this griddle for cooking pancakes."
2,Plastic prone to break in storage,"Cooking is ok, a bit akward to clean. We have used this for over two years. It is difficult to store without breakinc the brittle plastic sides. We expected to use the box it came in, but if you store it on the front end it will probably break the plastic front. I would not recommend this griddle. Better material should have been used for the trim parts."
5,PURCHASED AS A GIFT ~ THEY LOVE IT!,"I researched several brands before purchasing the Presto 07045 Family-Size Cool-Touch Tilt'N Drain Electric Griddle. This purchase was a gift for a friend. She wanted a griddle that was large enough to cook at least two types of foods at a time (i.e. eggs and pancakes). But not too huge that she could not take it with her on her boat on the weekends. She loves this gift. She likes the tilt feature to drain the bacon drippings before cooking another food type. She said the cleanup is quick and easy. It was a good find and a great gift. In addition, the cost was reasonable. This griddle is recommended!"
2,Doesn't heat evenly at all!,"I got this one as a gift and it looks nice, I like the tilt and drain feature and the non-stick surface works nicely. Unfortunately, it fails at the most important feature of a griddle: it doesn't heat at all evenly so cooking just doesn't work very well. I get bacon strips where one end is almost burnt while the other is barely cooked and I get pancakes where, again, one half is almost burnt while the other is barely cooked. This one is headed back to the store and I'll look for something that cooks evenly, or just resign myself to cooking pancakes in two pans over my stove's burners."
4,It's all right,"Had it for about 5 yrs now. Use it about once every 2 months. Was never impressed with the tilt feature as I still have to push the grease to the drain hole otherwise it goes nowhere. The outline of the heating coil can now be seen in the surface. This might say something about the thickness of the surface. Surface is showing wear, parts of it are brown. We've always used plastic spatulas and rags for cleaning. It does not heat evenly but that has never affected cooking time of pancakes, french toast and bacon. The corners may take 30-60 seconds longer, no biggie. The unit has also always stayed level. I do not have a previous griddle to compare this one to and I do not know what the lifespan of a griddle should be so am giving it a 4."
5,Love it,This griddle is EXECELLENT!! It's a life saver. I spend less time in the kitchen cooking meals for the family. I am so happy with this product..!!
1,Big Disappointment,"I ABSOLUTELY HATE THIS GRIDDLE. We bought oversize to make more pancakes and thought the cool-touch edge was a great idea. The Tilt'N Drain sounds great, but a mere bump of the cool-touch edge and the griddle falls into the drain position. Not what you're looking for when pouring pancakes. First of all, it still only accommodates five normal size pancakes (four corners and one in the middle). The surface is not level, and all the pancakes run towards the center giving them a distinctive oval shape. The biggest disappointment is the heating element. I purposely pour the center one first, and the one closest to the heating source last. Despite my efforts the one closest to the heating element source turns dark brown in no time flat, and the one in the center is barely ready to flip. End result...I'm shopping for a new griddle."
4,Great griddle,"Purchased this last Christmas. Our previous attempts to do pancakes for our family of 4 children were OK, but the small griddles and frying pans just didn't get the job done quickly enough. Most we could cook at a time were 5 in the circular Circulon electric frying pan. So we got this and it does the job. We're able to cook 8 to 12 pancakes at a time, so are able to cook the entire breakfast with just two batches.I like the drain feature for bacon, but as other reviewers have indicated it slides into the drain position much too easily. It has never done so during cooking, so our pancakes have always turned out great. But while getting it out of the cupboard and cleaning it, those handles just pop out. Would be nice if they had provide some sort of lock or quick-release mechanism.Also, as indicated by others, the heat is a little uneven. Pour batter in the top right corner last (next to where the heating element connects)."
2,Tilt n Drain is annoying,"Tilt n drain makes this griddle difficult to clean; there is no place you can hold it without the tilt ""wings"" flopping about awkwardly. It's also too large to fit easily in many sinks, so you will have to clean it by holding it vertically and spraying water on it."
5,"No muss, no fuss",The griddle performed as advertised. We used it to cook up a meat dish and the griddle outperformed an electric skillet on the same task. It is simple & easy to use and clean. What more could you want?
4,Pleased,"The pancakes turned out perfect & golden brown. Being able to cook eggs, bacon & pancakes all at once takes some getting used to for a newbie on a griddle. I would recommend"
5,Great Knife,This is a very good knife. i have had it for years. it is a good long lasting knife. i strongly recommend.
2,dont buy this shoe if you're like me,"This appears to be a great shoe for the person described above, but that appears to be questionable. As a mild pronating, medium arch runner, I found this shoe to cause big problems. My calfs would hurt after even short runs, maybe because of the low heel placement. Unless you have bought this shoe before, I would not suggest getting it online. Run on a treadmill at your local shoe store, make sure its right for you."
2,Boy howdy!,"An undeniably impressive display of guitaristics, Workin' Out is also more than a little cheesy. There's lots of down-homey and atmospheric numbers to showcase how versativel Kessel was, but precious little of real jazz value. Workin' Out is fun to hear, but only if your mood is cheerful and utterly undemanding, and it's in-your-face virtuosity might be of greatest interest to guitar students -- expect that, if I were learning jazz guitar, I'd personally rather sound like Kenny Burrell or Jim Hall. Kessel later gravitated to television and studio work, and it's not hard to hear why."
3,"""Workin' Out"" is Supposed To Be Good For You...","...but Barney Kessel's 1961 session can't compete with the various ""Poll Winners"" volumes (see my reviews ofThe Poll WinnersandThe Poll Winners Ride Again). The big difference for me was the level of musicianship -- pianist Marvin Jenkins, bassist Jerry Good and drummer Stan Popper are no match for Ray Brown and Shelly Manne. Despite this, I found ""Workin' Out"" to be a better exercise than the thoroughly boringModern Jazz Performances from Bizet's Carmen."
2,Read the reports !!!,"This product was rated recently by consumer reports. They, as you know, are the source for up to date and accurate reporting. I had one of these and concur with their findings. These are over-rated and very ineffective as far as air cleaners go. They dazzled me with high tech sounding reviews and descriptions. They do make the room smell good for a day or so and then you see why consumer reports rated them as they did. I would not buy another and have recently sold mine. I am buying a HEPA rated filter and would suggest you do the same. For the price i can get three and never have to worry about my room being as dusty as it was again. You do the research, and judge for yourself. Just an oppinion though !"
1,Flakey,I advise you to look for a different one. This one flakes out and it cheaply made. RadioShak has better ones.
5,the best of the britcoms,"Simply stated, the Yes, Minister series is the best of the classic Britcoms and my personal favorite. I find it applies to many of the political situations just as well today."
1,my eyes are burning,"I wanted to love this book. However, it was painfully boring to read and I found myself hating the characters. Actually, to hate them I would've actually had to really know who they were. The author doesn't develop these characters fully and the story reads flat as a result. I was hoping for way more of an effort out of this fellow Cardozo HS alumni turned gossip columnist/Howard Stern guest.**Redeeming value: Pages 24-33 are entertaining."
1,Rather flat & dull,"For a book that is to be about sex & drugs, it's not particularly sexy or wild. If there's anything more dull than boring people talking about their pathethic lives & sex & drugs, I can't think of it. I made myself read through to the end because I'd read a good review, but it must have been someone who owed the author a favor!"
1,Everyone's Boring,"Spiegelman displays no understanding of scene, character, tone, plot, or structure. Instead, the novel skips from one unrelated episode to another, never bothering to develop its character or explore their dynamics and relying heavily on Denis Johnson's Jesus' Son and Gus Van Sant's Drugstore Cowboy for inspiration. Ultimately, it's fairly pointless and forgettable. At a mere 164 pages, it's still way too long."
5,Thank You Ian Spiegelman!,"As a Queens native, who grew up just a few miles from Bayside, I can sum up Spiegelman's novel in one word: accurate. His prose style is straight forward; his characters are brilliantly pathetic. Life isn't always pretty and Spiegelman won't let you forget that."
4,Psychedelic Psoup,"Appearing in 1968, and disappearing just as quickly, Velvett Fogg's only LP is a truly great, lost classic of British psychedelic music. At it's best it features some imaginative guitar and organ workouts combined with quirky and unusual lyrics and the band's covers of 'New York Mining Disaster' and 'Come Away Melinda' add an eerie tone missing from the originals. Fogg's own originals include the childlike 'Wizard of Gobsolod', the haunting and somewhat dislocated 'Lady Caroline' and the jazzy workout of 'Owed to the Dip' but the tone of the album is set by the powerfully doom-laden opener, 'Yellow Cave Woman'. It's a great record and it's rounded off with the inclusion of the band's only single, a 68-style, special effect laden version of 'Telstar' - the sleevenotes, by John Peel, are a remarkable 1968 artifact in their own right."
4,Fun Party Time Poster,"Hollywood Monsters - LOVE IT!! I hung this up at a Halloween party and played a guessing game with it, covering the bottom section where it gives the identities of the subjects in the poster away, of course. Everyone at the party had a fun time guessing. It was a hit!!"
2,Caution - Runs Very small!,"I wanted tuxedos for our standard Goldendoodles to wear for Halloween and then have for other occasions. I order the extra large after carefully measuring. It didn't begin to fit our 16 month old, 65 lb doodle, let alone the 75 lb adult dog! It was cute and well made for a costume, but they are sizing these costumes for little dogs it seems. So the extra large might fit a boxer or a dog of about 40 lbs. To me that is a medium sized dog. Until those who make animal costumes and size them by girth, length and weight I won't buy one again. Amazon was great though and accepted my return. Super customer service."
3,"Sorta Cliche, but at times good.","I was hoping this book might explain some of the religious and philosophical allegories of the films. It does a little of that.Most of the book is very oriented about how you should live your life, to be free of your own personal matrices. Which is an ok message, but the book tends to get sorta ""rah, rah, rah, go team"" about it and keeps quoting the movies cliches over and over.I also feel that some of the analogies to historical events were either forced, or wrong. Things like ""Hitler was elected president and then became a dictator"" are not entirely accurate. Sometimes the author would pull off into tangents about other movies, and I wished he would focus on the movie at hand. And sometimes, I would disagree with the author's analysis of the films as too simplistic. (i.e. I don't think he gives Smith enough credit)Overall, there were some interesting points and analogies though, so parts of it made for good reading."
3,Millennium Review,This book was pretty interesting. It kept my interest so I would'nt put it down. It told the truth about Castro as a brutal despot and the Communist founders as a group of blood thirsty vultures who belong on the trash heep of history. It gave Truman a good review as a man who had to make tough choices and did so wisely.
4,a fun look at historical figures,I know that some will disagree strongly with some of the rankings (I did) but this is a very fun way to look at important figures in history. There are traces of pro-American bias in the rankings but overall they appear to be well considered. A good book for a wide range of age and expertise levels.
4,"1,000 People Who Helped Shape the Past 1,000 Years","This is a fascinating book. While it might be tempting to argue with the exact order of their rankings, reading about the 1,000 people they selected is the interesting part. While some are extremely well known, others are far more obscure but no less influential. The people featured in this book have affected every aspect of our lives today, whether it is through the invention of the printing press, the microprocessor or the cathode ray tube or through the development of seminal psychological, philosophical or political theories. This book will provide hours of interesting and informative reading and can be read one entry at a time if you have but one minute to spare."
5,"1,000 Years, 1,000 points of debate!","An excellant read. Even though I didn't agree with every entry, I had a great time reading them. I laughed out loud at many of their entries(who knew Napoleon had a classic Napoleonic complex). I also enjoyed the captions before every entry especially Thomas More #345 (a man for all seasons) was followed by the great French chef Auguste Escoffier #346 (a man for all seasonings). The entries are extremely well written and very witty. Happy reading!"
1,A pointless book.,"It is impossible to make an impartial account of the top people of the millenium, as well as absolutely impossible to make the choices. Many things rankled me. Not just the villification of Communism, especially Castro, people like to forget that he was a brilliant lawyer who defended penniless people and risked his life to free his country from the dictatorship of Bastista. Other reviewers show incredible jingoistic ignorance as to the choices, like one reviewer wondering why Karl Marx was ahead of Jefferson: its quite obvious why he is ahead of Jefferson, he was far more intelligent, and far more influential."
2,It was interesting but it was too biased.,"A lot of this book was entertaining, but I disagreed with a lot of what was said. They should have put Karl Marx in the top ten. They give catro a bad review even though he brought democrasy and prosperity to the country and fought for human rights. They justified Trumans use of the atom bomb on Japan. They said he saved Turkey and Greece from communist domination, but all he did was keep right wing dictaterships in power. How can they accuse Marx of lining his pockets. He worked hard writing and lived and died in poverty."
1,Junk,"This arm band is absolute junk. The day I got it, the plastic screen cover started to pull away from the fabric. Over the next couple days the velcro tabs started to come un-glued from the fabric, yes that's right, they are GLUED onto the fabric. The band also does not stretch, so when your arm flexes it gets very tight around your arm. The plastic screen cover is frosted so it makes it very difficult to see the screen. DEFINITLY NOT worth $20.00, find another arm band."
2,Sensationalism,"Save your money--this book is sensationalism.For example, in California people have been predicting bubble for the last generation (25 years).The reality is people prefer to live in Cali than in other places (anybody care to join me in Vladivostok? I didn't think so).The author is trying to scare you.I would not worry about it much."
4,his predictions are dead on,"If a book like this was written in 2008, it would be a no surprise.But, writing this Jan 2006 was probably would not have been easy since, real estate market was still hot and many of so called 'experts' were suggesting us to buy homes as real estate prices will continue to rise for ever.Comparing the authors predictions back then with what is happening in real estate market now, the author is dead on.I think, this is book is still relevant today even after we know what is happening in real estate market currently.The author basically analyzes the fundamental factors that can cause the realestate appreciation and looks at how the boom of last few years was decoupled from fundamentals. He mainly draws parallels with similar boom-bust cycle in Japanese real estate market around 1990."
3,Better than average read,"Nice insight into the dark underbelly of US real estate. Slightly paranoid, esp. concerning the Fed,etc...But definitely worth reading"
1,"Didn't this book used to be called ""The Coming Crash in the Housing Market?""","Talbott wrote ""The Coming Crash in the Housing Market"" in 2003. Since then houses in many places have doubled in value. I unfortunately listened to the advice of Talbott and others and held off purchasing. In the meantime, house values have doubled and my personal savings to buy a house are now worth 50 cents on the dollar. Thanks Mr. Talbott! In order for Talbott to be remotely creditable housing would first need to drop to 2003 levels, roughly 50%, and then it would need to fall more on top of that to account for what he argues in his first book.I am very unimpressed and disgusted that Talbott and his publisher would offer ""Sell Now!"" which essentially reiterates Talbott's dramatically wrong predictions from his 2003 book. I have to assume Talbott and his publisher make a lot of money from his guessing books."
2,do not buy............,"waste of money, a very hard read, and it seems the RE market is doing great in many of the areas he said would tank. After the slowdown late '06-early '07 the RE market has bounced back to the crazy over bidding days."
5,Dead on!,I was amazed by this book. Not because of the facts that he proposes within. But the facts that he got right since it's now August and everything he says that would happen at this point (back in January) has. The chickens are coming home to roost folks!
5,Eye opening,This book was wonderful and marked a major turning point for me. The honesty and courage in this book blew me away! Highly recommended!!
3,Its okay.,I couldn't finish it truthfully. The author seems to be stretching it out with over detailing descriptions throughout the novel.
1,There should be a recall,"I never expected a tech book from the real source would mislead its readers with so many mistakes. It was very frustrating specially for a beginner who tends to believe that 99% of computer problems are created by the users. It took me a few days' struggle to finaaly realize the mistakes were made by the writer. Now the book has become useless for me - a newby who doesn't know how to get round the errors. It is sad that Macromedia doesn't recall the book, or at least put amendment on their site."
1,------> Horrible Book,"Stay away from this book... I'll repeat it again STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK. This has to be the worst training book on the market. It should have never even come close to being printed. Yeah yeah your a dreamweaver expert and your thinking well maybe the people that wrote these reviews are not up to speed you know. Trust me I said the same thing and ignored the previous reviews, BAD IDEA, the book is filled with errors and not to mention wrong screen shots. Click on the authors name at the top of this amazon page and you'll see Nolan Hester he is an author on Frontpage books which he needs to stick to and leave Ultradev behind.The best book I found is the Ultradev 4 complete reference...."
2,Look elsewhere if you want to learn UltraDev.,"First of all, this book leads you to believe that UltraDev4 works with WindowsME . It appears there is some work around so it can work in this environment, but unless you want to go in and screw around with your OS it doesn't.Second, even with XP PRO and IIS it seems that there are a good number of errors in the book or maybe there is some compatibility issue with XP PRO or the version of IIS that comes with XP.If you are new to UltraDev and looking for a book that guides you through the steps of building a dynamic site this would be a great book if the instructions worked more often. As published, you'll learn some of the ins and out or UltraDev (which seems to be an awesome tool!) but most likely end up frustrated when things simply don't work.The book gets a second star because there are some parts you can work through without having to chase your tail trying to figure out what mistake you may have made, when in fact, the error is in the book."
2,"Easy to Read, but Got Errors","Like all the The Training from Sources series, it is easy to read and follow the instructions. But this particular book got many errors that got me frustrated since I am a beginner in ASP. It even skip some steps and didn't even mentioned it. You'll find out you have to do other steps when you got the error page display. The publisher doesn't have correction page either posted on its website. Good for getting to know Dreamweaver Ultradevelopment though."
2,Appropriate for decoration,"Not really a musical instrument. The head is paper-thin and sounds like, welll, paper. Looks nice though."
3,Good starter doumbek,"This doumbek is small but handy, and can easily be carried around. It's an inexpensive way to get started playing, and see if you want to invest in a bigger, pricier model. Also nice for a child or young person to play. It gives a pretty good tone, both in the center and at the rim. This CD is great to learn with:Doumbek Instruction, Rhythm Rides CD"
3,Mildly Depressing Book,"This book was the first that I read in the Campus series and I was quite disappointed. Nancy along with all of her friends are emotional and physical wrecks the entire time and it was more or less like a soap opera, not a mystery. It was nice that they tried to incorporate real life but Nancy, Bess, and George aren't nearly as close as they were before and all have something lousy happening-not all of which even gets fixed in the end of the book. The mini-mystery doesn't even happen until exactly halfway through the book. I hated to see Nancy drifting apart from her father. Nancy always seemed to be able to keep her composure but she loses it many times in this book and acts immature. This seems like a type of series that you have to read in order so I'm going to give it another chance and start with #1. Hopefully I won't have such a tarnished impression then."
1,A WONDERFUL SURPRISE!,"I WAS TRANFERRING A COUPLE OF 'RONDO' CASSETTES TO CD FOR A FRIEND OF MINE. ONE OF THE TAPES WAS BADLY WARPED AND I TOLD HER THAT I WOULD SEE IF I COULD FIND ANY OF HIS MUSIC ON LINE. I HAD NEVER HEARD OF RONDO VENEZIANO, BUT I ALWAYS CHECK AMAZON.COM FIRST WHEN LOOKING FOR MUSIC OR BOOKS AND YOU USUALLY 'FILL THE BILL'. I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE HOW MUCH OF HIS MUSIC YOU HAD, INCLUDING WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR.THANK YOU."
5,must read,Own the paperback version and when I saw this hardcover I knew it would make a great gift. Everyone should own one.
5,Great Book for the People with a Kid Soul on Christmas,This is the greatest book I have ever read. I wish there was other books like this. It help you to realize how fortuned we are with the little things we have. It is fun at the same time because you can see by this letters the great imagination the childrens have. IS A GREAT BOOK FOR ANY GIFT FOR ALL AGES. ...
3,Duplicate Trio,"Red Norvo's ""Trio with Jimmy Raney & Red Mitchell"" is another one of my Fantasy/OJC warehouse clearance sale finds on the Oldies/Collectables website. Unfortunately, with the exception of one song, ""Puby La Keg,"" all of this material also appears onThe Red Norvo Trios(see my review). Oh well, I guess I should have looked more closely at the track listing before ordering it. There is more music on the other CD, so my recommendation is to pass on this OJC disc in favor of the Prestige title."
4,My dogs love it.,I have 2 small dogs and they love this pillow. They usually run to get that pillow first. I find them both on this one the most. They have several that I have all together.
5,Watch Fados over time and see what emerges,"Every time I watch and listen to Fados by Carlos Saura, I peel back another layer, and enjoy the music and dance more deeply.It's a national treasure (Portugal) which is a bit of history on parade....from the first Portuguese sailors to ply the 7 seas, throughout the colonies and the arc of their histories, to Brazilian & African artists, rappers, the whole gambit, alpha to omega, of Portuguese soul music & magic....that I never knew existed until I saw this movie.It makes me ashamed maybe, sad certainly, to come from such a stiff, heartless culture, military industrial northern European, with so little spontaneous music directly from the heart, so little emotional range or skill. The extemporaneous free spirit of these songs, freshness, heartfelt, raw, unabashed, is rare in our culture. What a discovery.Hope it grows on you like it did on me....try it."
5,A great introduction to the wonderful world of primates!,"This book is suitable for all ages. I just loved Art Wolfe's photographs. With so much emphasis on ""trendy"" primate species like gorillas and chimpanzees, this book introduces readers to the dozens of primate species of which you may never have heard. Like the gibbons, the lesser and often forgotten apes - whose domestic lives are lived by the standards humans so often fail to meet (sexual equality, no color bars, paternal role in infant rearing, monogamy)! Plus tiny marmosets you can old in the palm of your hand. All these animals are there. I loved this book. It is not a comprehensive guide or identification manual like Noel Rowe's book which I also like. It is a pleasant and readable book! Shirley McGreal, Chairwoman, International Primate Protection League"
5,"Good, heartwarming baseball movie.","This was the best baseball movie I've ever seen. It's like what would happen if you crossed ""The Sandlot"" and ""The Bad News Bears"" then added Hallmark Hall of Fame sentiment. My opinion may be a bit biased since one of my friends was in this movie. But it was a great film nonetheless. :-)"
5,Delightful movie,"Found this little gem at the Dollar store,it was a great entertaing movie,I give it a 10. Catch it if you can, you won't be disappointed."
5,Product Details,"PLAYMATE: Lisa DerganCOVER: Karen McDougalPICTORIALS: Karen McDougal - Playmate of the Year; The Newton Girls- 6 pages of photos by Helmut Newton;INTERVIEW: Jerry Springer20Q: Craig KilbornFEATURES: Profile of Ken Griffey Jr., by Tom Boswell; article on Magic Johnson and his late-night TV show, by Scott Howard-Cooper; fiction, The Facts of Deathby Raymond Benson; Swimsuit fashions; articles: Put Mr. Spielberg On Holdby Steve Pond, the success of ""South Park""; Little Blue Miracleby Carl Sherman - all about Viagara."
3,good but not as advertised,"This charming little movie is well worth seeing. Unfortunately, it is advertised as having English subtitles but it does not. I understand French well enough to follow the story but I miss some of the dialogue. The movie itself has a great plot and a number of solid, well known actors. I'm just disappointed it is advertised saying it has English subtitles when it does not. C'est un mauvais jeu!"
2,A crime is to relate this movie to paradise...,"I got this move after watching the hilarious ""The Dinner Game"" (1999) with Jacques Villeret. Big mistake. With the amount of animosity between the main characters, it is hard to even hint at comedy - and I don't care if it's supposed to be regular or black comedy. How can you laugh at a couple that hates each other so much?! The ""jokes"" they play on each other are very stupid and crude - even life threatening. And we're supposed to enjoy this? The only redeeming moments are some relatively short scenes involving a corrupt attorney."
4,Gaither Homecoming Picnic,This DVD was for my mother and she watches it a lot so I guess she is happy so I am happy
5,An amazing story of strength and conviction.,"This book immediately caught my attention and I read it in one day. I think the message is timely and appropriate for many parents and reaches far beyond the subject of the Jehovah's Witness group. Brenda Lee has a wonderful flow of memories, humor and insight that bring together lessons that can be learned by parents. Even though I had no previous knowledge of Jehovah's Witness other than the name, I felt myself identifying with several situations and feelings. She ties all of the events in her life to certain decisions made by her family and by herself. I feel the book will pertain to almost every parent - just substitute the word cult (or JW) with drugs, alcohol, undesirable peers, etc. There are many lessons to be learned from this book and I am thankful I learned about it and read it."
4,Cult is as Cult Does,"In a simple conversational style, Brenda Lee describes finding inner strength and determination, despite being surrounded by 'loving' forces that would reign her in.She does not provide details of the Jehovah's Witness organization nor go into depth about the J.W. theology.Brenda's story describes the painful walk made by children raised in cult mentality. With compassion and humor (self generating orgasms while sitting for hours in church), she shows how anyone could be susceptible to a totalitarian doctrine, with subsequently fractured intimate relationships.Brenda deserves praise for coming forth with her story. Others raised in high demand organizations will appreciate validation for their isolating experience.Educators, social workers and medical providers would benefit from this childhood story. Children such as Brenda are in our communities. They deserve to be recognized and assisted.Congratulations, Brenda, for creating your life and sharing your lessons!"
5,Escape from a Cult,"What a story! Having been a JW myself for 30 years, I was engrossed in this book, couldn't put it down until I had read it all the way through. It is so true that the JW religion is just like the author says, hard to believe, but true. As I said, I was a JW in the past, but not now. I am just beginning to learn what kind or religion I was enslaved to for so many years. If anyone is thinking of becoming a JW, I recommend he reads this book first, and think of how this book is not fiction, it is the absolute truth!"
3,Disappointing,"Based on the reviews of others, I thought this book would be different. I was very disappointed to see that it is just another book detailing someone's difficult passage through young adulthood and the world. Heartening, yes. But unique and different, no. I am still waiting for the book to be written that details what it is REALLY like for someone to be born into, and raised in JW's... and the ultimate struggle of leaving your entire life behind when your eyes are opened to the ""REAL TRUTH."""
5,Excellent book!!!!!!!,"I found this book fascinating. I am so glad that this woman wrote this book. It gave me insight about the cult of Jahovah's Witnesses. Wow, I always knew they were a bunch of wackos but then to discover how they treat their children. It is pathetic! I don't believe that God wants us to live our lives like this. I give this woman tremendous credit for escaping. She went through so many trials and tribulations to get where she is today. I am proud of her and I hope her work can help others struggling with the same issues of escaping cults.This is an excellent read."
4,Out of the Cocoon,"Out of the Cocoon is only one more example of the pain which cults inflict on any member who decides to think for them self. I was impressed by Brenda Lee's candor. As a former Jehovah's Witness of 30 years myself, I could empathize with her pain, and frustration which led to her being shunned and separated from her family. I recommend this book highly.Roy"
2,"Needs a ghost writer, badly","The book in itself is interesting, with regard to her family and this religion. But, the book seems rather simple, and she could have added pizzazz to it by employing a ghost writer. Either way, I wish the author the best."
3,Not as riveting as expected,"I was disappointed in this memoir. I am very anti-Witness and I believe that they are responsible for a lot of things, but it seems that Ms. Lee found a scapegoat in the Witnesses for virtually anything that went wrong within her family. Granted, they did encourage a separation from her family that was undoubtedly devastating for her. I wondered, when I got to the ""childcare"" section, what that topic had to do with her memoir? It was detours like this that left me unconvinced of the pure evil of the Witnesses in her life.I am always happy, however, to see books like this on the market, because there simply aren't enough out there. The Witnesses are a bad, bad religion and can wreak havoc on the average family. This book and others serve as a warning for those with any contact with the cult.A truly excellent, well-researched read is Diane Wilson's memoir about the evils of the Watchtower Society.Awakening of a Jehovah's Witness: Escape from the Watchtower Society"
2,Why?,"I just wanted to ask..why is this book found when searching ""Mormon"" on amazon? It does not actually fall under the category."
1,way off track,"Could not be more wrong........if you don't want to be a J.W. - don't be one, no one MAKES you do anything, that's why its called being a VOLUNTEER - all children can eventually make their own decisions.......pretty sure catholics and EVERY OTHER religion on the planet bring their kids to sunday school, church, or whatever they call it, and nobody calls them a cult."
2,Extremely dense,"While this product offers an astounding quantity of catnip at an unbeatable price, buyers should be aware that this toy is so incredibly heavy that most cats will be physically unable to play with it. I don't know if my cats are unusually weak or what, but even when they work together they're unable to push the sack more than a few inches at a time. The low sale price is also offset by the cost of shipping such a massive brick of catnip across the country. Cat fanciers would probably be better served by more traditional cat toys, like a nice clothbound copy of The Infinite Jest that their kitties can bat around."
1,tiny and not cool,i bought this hoping that my dog could wear a tux when i do. i have a 50lb lab and this was way way too small for her (i bought a large). I couldn't fit this over her head and it is poor quality. my lab is the smallest full size lab i have seen so don't buy this if you have dog that is not tiny.
4,Great buy,I purchased these for my Z650. Good thing they came with an adapter cause the lenses don't fit the adapter the camera came with but all in all a good buy.
4,good for the money,lens works great for the money i would recomend to anyone who are just started to explore the world of photography
3,Very short history,"In only 64 pages this can't be much more than a very, very short history of men's underwear so if you are looking for a detailed history, this is not it. If however you are just interested in the basics and especially how men's underwear has changed in the past two centuries in America then this book is a good place to start. There are many photographs and ad copies incloded that are interesting but since Griffin talks a good deal about the role of popular media in helping to make chances to underwears sales it would be better if he'd included ads featuring some of the ""heartthrobs"" he mentions. A lot more could be done frankly on the topic and has been done in more generalized books on clothing for both sexes."
3,like young,"Greco only improves with age. Like Nat Cole, he is jazz oriented and sings jazz and scat well."
2,"Looking for cheese, here it is...for all you loungers","Buddy Greco sounds like he consumes just a little too much cheese, making some of these standards sound cheesier then if Steve Lawrence were singing them(ouch!) But I'm sure all of you lounge collectors will enjoy this emberessing session."
1,beware atlona,"would one work in one speaker, bad product, tried on several different speakers, would not work"
5,What a Film,This is even more real than American History X in my opinion. When you watch real movies it makes you think about the society we all live in. Menace 2 Society is very deep and meaningful. From beginning to end you stayed glued to the tube to see what happens next. This is a film that should be seen by anyone who is old enough to watch it. I would recommend that you check this film out if you already havent.
5,Movie 4 Society,"This is one brilliant film!! Just like it says on the box, 'Boyz 'n' The Hood' and 'New Jack City' were never this real. O-Dog iz 1 crazy mu'f~@er. The scene at the beginning in the store is real hot and the crazy Dog keeps the tape to watch! You gotta see this film."
4,The Best Hood movie,"Powerfull and Dramatic yet bloody and gruesome, this movie is without a doubt the best hood movie of all time. It shows two totally different sides of life in the hood. Caine is trying his best too make something of himself and get out of the hood. His friend O Dogg is a thug who likes to brag about the men he kills. The film starts as Caine and O Dogg go into a store to buy a bear. The Asian clerks fear that they may steel so they hurry them. The male clerk tells O Dogg that he feels sorry for his mother so O Dogg kills both of them. There are some especially bloody scenes. This is a must see for fans of Boyz N the hood and Friday."
5,Menace II Society,I remember seeing this film back in the 90's and had to make it part of my collection. It's a must have for anyone who was ever into the gangster rap movie scene.
5,ghetto,Make u wanna run from ghetto places at all time in raise yo son up right I try not to go around ppl like this I just watch they movies but I like this
2,What Happened To Tyrin Turner?,"The acting was wonderful, but the movie wasn't so stimulating. My mistake to expect another "" Boyz In Da Hood "" because unfortunately Menace doesn't live up to the hype it produced. Not my number one pick at all and about 10,000 steps behind the king of urban gang films "" Boyz In Da Hood "". Tyrin Turner and Larenz Tate did fine jobs. Jada Pinkett was as bland as ever. The supporting casts were better than the top cast any day. They had a lot of familiar faces that popped up. What ever happened to Tyrin Turner? I remembered him from the Rhythm Nation video and since Menace haven't seen him since.If you like gangsta flicks, this is cool but it doesn't compare to John Singleton's Oscar masterpiece."
5,The most powerful movie I have ever seen!!!!,"Its absaloutly a terrific movie.Its one of the best films ive seen.Its got a very intese ending,and very powerful acting.The movie shows what the real world is like and it shows how realistic and vielent it can be"
5,Very Good Movie,This movie was a harsh and realistic protrayal of life in the ghetto. The acting was top notch and the plot was great. I liked how the story is told from a first person perspective. It really adds a lot.
3,"RAW, VIOLENT, FOUL LANGUAGE","CAN they make a ghetto movie without all that foul language??? yes it happens, but all movies about black young men killing each other and rapping are violent, raw, and the language is awful!!!"
1,Menace has no particular storyline to it,"Menace to society has no particular structure within the film. Instead the director Tyrin Turner has gone for a graphic and visual potrayal of living in South Central. The characters are one dimensional and there was no attachment towards them. Although it may have more violence than previous films of the same genre, Menace to Society is not a good justification of struggle. If you want a real Gangster film watch Boyz N the Hood or South Central LA."
1,What A Waste!,"The Hughes Brothers have such potential that it disappoints me to see how awful Menace II Society was. Although it claims to be a clear portrayal of life in ""stereotypical"" ghetto in Los Angeles, I feel that it is such a copout to take the easiest thing to write about and turn it into film. It would be a greater accomplishment if they could successfully portray the lives of those who've managed to rise above rather than repeat the story of those who've failed to get out. Menace II Society just wastes your time by reiterating the same old stereotypes and puts them onto the faces of African-Americans in film. I definately recommend you DON'T waste your time."
4,"even if you don't like it, wait until the last scene...","...it'll be worth it. i won't go into details, but that chilling image that the hughes brothers crafted was probably one of the best pieces of cinema i've ever seeen. even after seeing a number of times, it still gets me. having said all that though, do check out the movie for its performances, particularly larenz tate's, belivability, and overall message."
4,A very powerful film,In my opinion even more powerful than Boyz. We can only hope that the message got to the intended audience so so much needless waste of life can one day be stopped.
3,100% average,"I went into this movie expecting a little Dead Presidents-type drama and charactor development. What I got instead was a very ho-hum account of thug life. I don't know how this director managed to make drive by shootings boring, but he did it somehow. I just never felt any attachment to any of the actors to the point where I didn't give a hoot if they lived or died. The main charactor is sympathetic in one scene, then a total maniac in the next. There is never a common theme throughout the entire film, and every charactor has split personalities. The dialogue is pretty lame and the basic plot of the movie is revenge. This one is getting that one and that one's getting this one back. Just kind of juvenile and boring. I'll watch Dead Presidents again just to get this bad taste out of my mouth. If you're interested in a great thug movie with plot, dialogue, and development that's your answer to this mediocre attempt."
2,The Best Getto Movie I Ever Seen!,I think that menace II Society was a great movie. The movie Don't Be A Menace II Society In South Central While Drinking Your Juice In Your Hood to me was just like this movie. I think this movie was off the chain and if you have not seen it then buy it.It is worth the money.
5,After Boyz in da hood,"came this, a raw powered movie, that brings to the real of the early 90's South Central LA. This movie is pretty violent and gory, but yet it has a pretty strong message in it. Do you care wether you live or die?Tyrin Turner(Kaydee) did a excellent dabut about a man who gets cought up in a situation he wants to get out of. Larenz Tate(O-Dog) is more of a straight up gangsta, but did a real good job at acting. Movies with strong messages like this make up for a excellent drama.If you loved boyz in the hood and don't have this, that's a real shame, even if you didn't watch bouz in da hood, you should get this, and boyz in da hood as well, because those 2 movies are wll-worth the money.peace"
5,OH YEAH,"LOVE IT REMINDS ME OF MY LIFE,BOUGHT IT USED YOU WILL NEVER KNOW ITS USED GREAT FOR THE PRICE GRAB YOURSELF ONE."
5,Menace II Society,"I like wathing hood movies, and Menace II Society is a classic. So many classic lines from this movie. And of course it looks great on Blu-Ray. This movie is suppose to be an in-depth portrayal of the struggles of growing up in 90s inner-city LA. I saw some people write ""Now I really understand why these people are like this. It all makes sense now."" I guess its suppose to give you an understanding of how these inner-city youth get pulled into the gang lifestyle and help you to sympathize with them. I dont think it does that for me. It just show how absolutely ignorant gang banging is and now stupid the people who engage in this activity are. I've never sympathized and never will with someone who chooses this kind of lifestyle. But never-the-less its an entertaining movie. Like I said, its a classic, along with Boyz N The Hood, Juice, etc. I upgraded to Blu-Ray and suggest you do the same."
5,Nice extras,"The quality on the movie is great and seeing the directors older, commenting on their movie in the extras content was nice. I didn't really enjoy the commentary. It seemed a bit all over the place."
4,Menace II Society,Story about everyday life in Watts as seen through the eyes of a teenager who is trying to overcome his bleak surroundings. This movie gives younger individuals a chance to understand the decisions they make during their teens and early adulthood and to always find hope in time of hardships. A classic to new generations.
5,the hughes brothers are ghetto scorseses,"this is one of my favorite movies. it really shows that the hughes brothers know what they're doing. the drive-by scene with the mac-10s is particurlarly well shot. this movie really reminds me of some scorsese hits like goodfellas. so if you like goodfellas, and you listen to rap music, you'll definately like this title."
3,C'mon record company!?!,"I find this rude when a record company wants to charge 12.99 for three songs (in the age of cd burning; or any age for that matter). The customer needs more value - especially when they have often already purchased the full length release.Bowie is awesome, his work on Heathen incredible...the intrinsic value of this disc is not.I don't care if it's an import. I need at least five or six songs (or versions of songs) to justify 13 bucks!"
5,Fabulous Solo Soprano,Just heard this CD for the first time and....WOW!!! What amazing vocals ....the soprano voice is so delicate and pure... simply sublime...The emotion of the singer was truly beautiful and made the experience of listening to the CD a magical experience.
4,Rocka Rolla Album,"Record seems to be in very good shape, no scratches and perfectly flat. Cover is also in a good used condition."
5,"What it's like to be ""on the job"" fighting fire.","Fires and firefighters have fascinated people since the days of the bucket brigade. In this book, Steve Delsohn has taken the time to get behind the scenes, and talk to the men and women who do the backbreaking, dirty work that is firefighting.This is a closed society, just because no one else can understand what it is we see day in and day out. Among us are the Samaritans wishing only to help others, the adrenaline junkies who groove on the rush you get going in to a burning building, and the guys who just like the days off.A lot of people try to get on the job, and not many make it. This is your chance to see what it's like, and who the real people are who man (person?) the firestations around this country. After reading it, you'll understand why I'm proud to call all of them my brothers."
4,A good book.,"This is a very good book. It is a good read for anyone with an interest in firefighting. I found that, as a firefighter, the book did seem to lack that little bit that would make it a great book. I can't really say why...maybe the format just wasn't for me or maybe it's the fact that there are a number of compilation books similar to this. Either way, I still thought it was a good book, it just isn't in my top 5 firefighter books."
2,This cd has more songs!,"I agree with Jon; this cd is only for the most hardcore fans! And it has 24 songs, not 15!!!"
2,24 songs on this cd not 15,"Yeah, I also have 24 songs on this cd myself, not 15 songs as amazon.com thinks this cd has. But even though; just the more pleasure for those who order this cd and think they only get 15 songs. But I agree with Jon Thor, this is only for the outmost hardcore Elvis fans"
2,Very basic. Short answers. Small book . Not worth it for $55,I was very disappointed when the book arrived. It is a very basic book. You can find the answers to most of the questions on the internet. I finished the whole book in less than 15 minutes. No way it can be a reference & learning guide for FICO consultant. $10 should be a fair price for this type of book.
2,no stuff,"This book is very small and there is almost no stuff in it.. I just went through it once and it seems like a collection of unrelated facts you can recall if you are familiar with FICO. If you are a beginner, this book will not be helpful in my opinion. If you are an intermediate/expert, this book has absolutely no stuff in it. I was expecting to see some case studies, industry specific scenarios etc but there seem to be none. I do not recommend this book."
1,"SAP FICO Interview Questions, Answers, and Explanations: SAP FICO Certification Review",there are only 75 total questions for all fi co modules very basic question and very short answers. The answers are not explained in detail. It is a very short book. $54.00 NOT WORTH IT. most of these questions can be found online.
1,Waste of money,I should have listened other people's review. The half of the book is filed with a list of tables and t-codes. It is not worth the money.
5,Great and Green Option,"First purchased Herban Cowboy soap a year ago and I've been hooked ever since. It does have a definitive scent but it dissipates fairly quickly outside of immediate contact with the skin - though that scent is less than half of the reason I keep coming back. I've switched from product, to product, to product and this was the first that leaves my skin feeling refreshed but cleaned. Highly recommend."
5,Smells great and natural,"This is an incredible find, it's difficult to find a cologne that is natural and smells like real cologne. This product does both. The smell is pleasant and long lasting, but doesn't overpower. This is absolutely great and it doesn't bother my wife who is sensitive to chemicals."
1,Doesn't smell like other HC Dusk products?,"I use and enjoy the HC Dusk soap, deodorant, and aftershave balm, so I thought I'd buy the same fragrance as a cologne. It does NOT smell at all like the other Dusk products. This smells like the cheap, awful colognes my aunts used to buy me when I was 12. It reeks and one spray made my room smell like rubbing alcohol for hours.I'm concerned that I got a spoiled/bad batch or something, seeing as I really like everything else in the fragrance/brand."
5,awesome natural cologne,"This is my boyfriends favorite cologne. I ordered him a new bottle for Christmas and he was very happy. Not too strong, smells great and best of all it's vegan!"
5,Smells great!,"Organic or not; this smells great! It has a real masculine scent. It does not smell perfumey or fruity. One thing I really enjoy is that the scent stays and keeps the same smell. For me, being organic does not matter. I've worn this cologne now for 5 years. I wore it while dating my now wife, and now that we are married. She loves the smell! She's the honest type and would tell me if she did not. She actually bought a bottle for me one time as a gift. I highly recommend trying this."
3,Too simplistic,"I couldn't make it past the first three pages of this book. It was too corny for me. I didn't feel healed at all. Pretty picture, though."
4,An older fan in Phoenix,"It was a nice surprise for me finding a new music by him. I bought it last week and have listened to it a couple of times, and like it a lot. I still play his solo records after departing Ted Nugent from years ago, one simply called St.Holmes ( wish I could find this on CD ), and the best of all his one-time Withford/St. Holmes project w/ Brad Whitford of Aerosmith. ""Sharpshooter"" is still one of my all time favorite songs,and for me one of great under-rated rock vocalists of all times.I saw him back in mid-80's in a club in Madison, WI called Headliners, and he came out after the show and chatted with us. Super nice guy. Buy this CD, and enjoy the memories..."
5,St. Holmes Rocks!,"For those who don't know, Derek used to be the front man for Ted Nugent. If you're a Nugent fan, you should know that all the hits Ted had, it was Derek on Vocals and he wrote or co-wrote all the hits; ie: Stranglehold, Hey Baby!, etc. This album really rocks and is a must for any Rock or Blues Fan. His site kick butt too: http://www.derekstholmes.com"
4,Great knife for a great pice,"I bought the knift in a store, but found it agian online. Sold it back, and got it here.Incredibly useful in a lot of situations, as well as really streamlined and nice looking.In store it was $50, on here is much cheaper, and the same quality!"
5,My favorite movie,"I can't talk about this movie without sobbing. The best ending I've ever seen in a motion picture. I just saw the remake on TV, it was O.K., but my heart belongs to the original"
4,Great Film!,This is areally good movie and just like Cannery Row it took for ever to come out on DVD now hopefully more will get a chance to enjoy it
3,WORTH RESURRECTING,Schmaltzy tearjerker tv movie about a woman with healing powers.Ellen burstyn is great as usual and this is definitely worth checking out.
5,An all-time favorite...,I'd been looking for this movie for a long time. I'm really glad it's available! It's a 1980 movie which I saw on TV a few years after it came out.
3,An unforgettable story,Review: five stars for the story line ZERO stars for the quality of the DVD. I have long wanted this story on DVD. It is well written and Ellen Burstyn deserved the accolades she received for acting. I would watch this movie many times BUT I CAN'T!!! The disk I bought was of very poor quality stopping many times while playing. Much of the dialogue was lost because it restarted at a point well past where it stopped. Will NOT buy another disk through this source again.
5,"Why is this film/novel so unavailable, I wonder?","Here is a film that won Academy Award nominations and has received a tremendous amount of positive reviews on this site and elsewhere ever since it came out in 1980 - obviously a film and a story that has moved many people. Why, then, is it not even out on DVD? Why can't you find the original novel by Lewis J. Carlino under books? Why doesn't Netflix even list the film as one of Ellen Burstyn's? All very mysterious and frustrating. Get this film on DVD, Amazon, and get the book back out too!!"
5,Ellen Burstyn in a magnificent performance,"In spite of this movie's weakness and some flaws (Sam Shepard for instance), Ellen Burstyn saves it with a performance so intense and believable that sent chills down my spine several times during the movie. It is an unforgettable performance maybe equalled by her performance in ""Requiem for a Dream""."
4,Resurrection,"I liked this movie, the unknown, the unexpected, its about a woman who comes back from a serious accident and finds out she can heal people."
5,"Resurrection, a film long before its time.","The film resurrection was an incredible film in its day 20 some odd years ago, and even today in the year of 2000 its message still is more powerful than ever. This movie exhibits the real life of a woman who lives through a near death experience only to find herself in unfamiliar territory. Proving that seeing the ""other side"" can really change a person in the physical. As she moves through this film demonstrating a ""christ-like"" healing energy, she aknowledges it as coming from love. This universal understanding we all can learn from - be it any belief system. It is chalked full of heart felt teary eyed moments, and joyous warmth that will leave you on the edge of your seat with faith. This classic is a MUST see. Ellen delivered the performace of her life.Elizabeth Schechter Writer- MEA Television Productions"
1,Who does your movie reproduction into video; get rid of them!,Ordered this a second time. Neither one has adequate sound quality. Poor reproduction of what I had hoped would be an enjoyable viewing. I will not order video from you again.
2,mediocre disc quality,"a good movie but the dvd disc was not able to play smoothly all the way through, at least on my cheap dvd player."
5,This is a movie which I would like to see a sequence to.,"Even ten years after I saw it play on TV, I still think of it. I finally found its title here, at this terrific site. I didn't even know any of the actors' names. This movie gives, in my opinion, a very credible insight on what happens to an ordinatory person who becomes gifted with healing powers and how it can affect people, and not only those who are healed. Its a drama that no one can forget, that touches you forever. I wish that I too could ........"
1,Ressurrection,"Product is scratched, will be returning it just haven`t had time to. It arrived before the due date which was good."
5,A Truly Spiritual Movie,"This is not an emotional you-will-find-peace-in-emptiness movie. It is exceptionally well played with some of the finest actors and it takes a hard look at ""faith healing"" ... the good and the not so good. I recommend for all as a movie that is gently inspirational and not in your face and obvious. Ellen Burstyn and Sam Shepard are excellent as is the grandmother played by the great actress in her final performance, Eva LeGallienne."
5,blockbuster true story of deceit and intrigue.,"A young marine is ""volunteered"" for a mission in china. The team is betrayed and abandoned. They must and do fight their way across China with the help of the ""Dragon Lady"". She is leading a group of Chinese freedom fighters. The author even had a chance to kill Mao Tse Tung. The Year is 1950 and our hero even comes across a WWII POW in a bamboo cage in, I believe, Peking. The action is fierce and there is even some romance."
1,Horrible book,"This book is pure nonsense. If you are looking for some practical insights into the creative process, look somewhere else."
1,Available free on Gutenberg.org,"FREE at [...]/ Just to give a head's up to everyone: ALL of Thomas Troward's books and lectures are FREE at the Gutenberg Project's website - [...]Thomas Troward's work is amazing - and well worth reading. But, why pay for someone's copy of what has been made available for FREE."
1,Not worth it.,"This book just lost me in the way it is written. Am sure the points are good, but too tough for me to wade through to get them!"
2,For kids,"I would've figured Mr. Rancic would give us some insights to business and did not get that. It is still a good inspirational book, pass it on to a teenager because ITS FOR KIDS."
2,obvious and done better by others,"The theories and ideas presented by this book are great, but the way they are presented completely turns me off to their ideas. It seems to be presented in a fantasy world and while the teacher in the book still struggles with how to implement these ideas, it does not feel like real experiences. The examples of how to respond to the kids don;t seem genuine and are in many cases impractical.If you still want to explore these ideas check outTeaching With Love and Logic: Taking Control of the Classroom, it does a much better job at presenting almost the same material in a much better way."
5,A Fantastic Practical Approach,"This book is full of practical everyday situations that a teacher faces. It is a quick easy read since it isn't quoting research studies along the way, but instead is based on the experience of the teachers and authors over 30 years ago. I have found their ""advice"" to be very useful in my classroom today as well as being very consistent with the educational studies that I reviewed while studying for my Master in Education. Every teacher that I have passed it on to has had similiar reactions. A must read in my teacher library!"
2,I bought this book by accident...,"I was in a rush and thought it was about 'How to talk so kids can learn...TO TALK.' So as the non-educator mother of a 13 month-old, my opinion may not be the most valuable. However, I did find the book to be a little wishy-washy. Of course its better to open a dialogue rather than to lecture, but does an adult have the obligation to walk on eggshells when responding to poor behavior on the part of a child? And while I can see why gratuitous punishment might not work well, the advice to never punish seemed off base to me. It could easily be interpreted as 'never force a child to face the negative consequences of their actions.' I just don't think that works with kids. But, like I said, I'm not a teacher. It does seem like some of the advice in the book might create a better classroom environment in the long run."
4,Pretty good advice,"I ordered this book to complete an education credit, and I was pleasantly surprised with it. I figured it would be a lot of psycho-babble, and just be loaded with education buzz words. The examples they gave were a little hokey, and some of them are definitely fiction, but overall, it did make me sit back and think about how I communicate with kids."
4,"Great Storage, but weight and software a con","It does exactly what you expect it too. Plug it in and you're set to go, which I really really like. The only cons are that it weighs a good five pounds (maybe more) and that there is no software included with the package. The box comes with a power cable, usb cable and the drive. It's plug and play though, so not having to install any drivers or software are actually a plus for me."
1,"NOT WHAT I THOUGHT, SADDENS' ME","THIS BOOK IS NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN, VERRRRY DISAPPOINTED. SINCE I AM AN ARTIST, I COULD HAVE USED MY PUBLISHER PRO ON MY COMPUTER TO MAKE LOVE NOTES TO MY MAN. THIS BOOK IS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAS NOOOOOO CLUE AT ALL ON HOW TO BE ROMANTIC!!! NOT EVEN ROMANTIC, BUT WHO IS NAIVE ON DATING. THIS BOOK IS FOR A TEENAGE BOY OR GIRL WHOSE STARTING TO DATE HIS/HER PEER(S) (A HIGH SCHOOL GIRL OR BOY). I DO NOT RECOMMEND."
2,Not for Me...,I had bought this with the intention of giving it to my husband for Valentine's Day. Maybe our relationship is weird but I didn't even give it to him.The coupons in the book just didn't pertain to us at all.Maybe you will have better luck with them.
5,Fun,Really enjoyed these coupons. They help keep the romance alive.An excellent companion is The Romantic's Guide by Michael Webb. It is a book packed with creative ideas.
2,Not the best read!,"You know the old expression, ""Never judge a book by its cover,"" well that adage definitely applies with this book! I received the paper-back print of this book in the mail a few weeks ago and spent this week reading through it. Despite the awesome art and concept the book was a mix between boring, erroneous, and the occasional inspiring quote. This book will sit on my shelf for the art and title, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone as a serious read into Celtic Spirituality!"
1,Steigenhoffer is correct.. It reads like a draft.,"I bought this as a fairly inexpensive ebook. It was not worth the price. It reads like an early draft with no proofreading. The book opens with a prologue featuring this run-on sentence, which is missing a verb in the first clause. ""Malka a primitive planet, its habitants very similar to those on earth, where two clans of Barbarian [sic] warriors fight for supremacy; but it is this fight that threatens to eradicate this race of beings."" The hero introduces himself to the heroine as follows: ""I am Niro and I mean you know [sic] harm,"" he said [sic] his voice deep and velvety. The misuse of such basics of 'too' and 'to' and 'know' and 'know, the failure to use the most basic commas, and the complete disregard of the proper verb tense are constant throughout. The author is creative, but the grammar and spelling would cause a grade school child to receive a failing grade."
4,fine record worth checking out,"This is a fairly unique record from Don Friedman's quartet which consisted of Friedman, guitarist Attila Zoller, bassist Dick Kniss and drummer Dick Berk. The record is split into two distinct pieces. The first 4 tunes are essentially free jazz. However, this is not the same avante guarde/free jazz of Albert Ayler, Cecil Taylor, or Late-era John Coltrane. This music contains far fewer hard edges and generally has a more impressionistic feel to it, which causes it to be less jarring than some free jazz.The second half of the record finds the quartet exploring three more straight-forward pieces. On these pieces it becomes more clear that Friedman has a style similar to his friend Bill Evans, but Friedman isn't quite a Bill Evans clone. His interaction with Attila Zoller highlights the unique aspects of both of their styles.Overall it is a fine record worth checking out."
4,Nipper Hits a Home Run Again,"Suffice to say, Nipper has great taste in selecting the greatest hits of the 1920s! ""Collegiate"" can bring a laugh and a smile to every listener, and ""My Blue Heaven"" never grows old. This is a must-have!"
5,The Very Best of the Twenties,This CD is the best introduction to the popular music of the 1920s. The sound quality is as good as possible considering the source material.
4,A solid introductory compilation.,"At twenty songs, this is a decent sized compilation into the popular music of the decade that roared. Some of these songs are familiar (Rhapsody in Blue) and other songs you'll be surprised to find familiar, having never known their name before.Now, the 1920s is a bit before my time. I love this music though. This, aside from the movies, was really my introduction to it."
5,Inspires you to be more patient with life,"I loved this little book!!It was filled with so much wisdom. If you need a little wisdom and inspiration in life, I suggest you reading this book."
5,Inspirating and Uplifting!,"Reminiscient of the Bible, but universal in it's appeal. Advice on how to act and live and believe. This book was written in 1923, but is timeless in the wisdom of which it speaks. I would recommend this book as a gift for someone you know who is going through times of difficulty, or adversity, no matter their religious beliefs."
2,Gibran Unbound,"I love Gibran's work. However, this small volume is not well made. I gave them as gifts. Pages started falling out of both copies as soon as the books were opened. Unfortunately, I was unable to return them because the deadline had passed. If you are contemplating buying The Prophet, buy a different volume."
4,the prophet by kahlil gibran,The book itself is good - but unhappy as I paid for a new copy of the book and as I was looking through it I had been written in and I see it is a used copy so???? I am glad I did not send it as gift to someone.
5,Excellent for teens & Young adults,"I read The Prophet years ago as a freshman college student & wished I'd read it in high school.The lessons in this book can really positively impact the life of a teen or young person.I've found another book that is geared towards young people that also gets this same message across, in an epic adventure way that teens like.The Prophetic Tales of No Child Left Behind[...]I stumbled across this book & decided to buy it for a niece that's a senior in high school. Its very rough, with some errors but the impact it had on her life, was similar to the impact The Prophet had on mine. If you like Kahlil Gibran, I think you could appreciate this also."
4,Interesting,Easy read. Interesting book. I bought this book on a chance of luck & really enjoyed it. I recommend it to everyone.
3,Not sure you'll get much from it,"I originally read this early in college and didn't think it was anything special then. I saw it recently in a used bookstore for two bucks, so I bought it.It took about an hour to read.There were about a dozen short passages I underlined. Most of them weren't really revelations, but rather really good analogies I liked or uniquely descriptive ways of presenting commonly known truths."
2,Unexpected purchase,"I evidently misread the writeup, I thought it was a hardback. It was a cheap paperback. I got it as a present so I couldn't send it back but I'm very dissapointed for the cost!"
5,Beautiful,"This book transcends all religions, and explains the many questions we have about life through what seems like a channeled spiritual source. This book is not long, but says so much is so few words. Highly recommended!!"
4,Thought provoking and insightful,A worthwhile read for anyone exploring their consciousness. Put it on the shelf or store it on your Kindle because it is a great reference guide when faced with life's challenges.
1,Not as advertised,"Despite the designation [Audio CD] when I ordered item 9562910318 I received a paperback book. Because I wanted it in Audio CD format, I returned it for a refund."
5,A companion for all time,"I was given a copy of THE PROPHET in 1945 when I entered the army as a teenager in the closing year of the second World war. The little ""shirt pocket edition"" I carried with me in those army years sits today on my bookshelf, and now provides its inspiration and guidance on those days when my contemplative mood reminds to listen, again, to the poetry and love of this timeless author. Give this book that Gibran may give to those you love, as he has done, for so many years, to millions, worldwide.Frank Ferguson"
5,A priceless jewel of a book. I have read it again and again.,The book and the paintings of Gibran are a joy for the heart. I read the book again and again . Its is like an ever fresh flower which perfumes the reader with its fragrance. Any one who wants the book for free please contactNavinkumar@hotmail.com
4,A Real Pleasure,"This book was a fine, smooth, easy read. Well thought out lines of philosophy are presented in a non-offensive easily digestible manner. It's a nice bit of thought provoking fluff, with none of the downside of heavier philosophers.It's positive in its outlook, without being unrealistic. There are some almost metaphysical aspects of the material presented, but nothing too heavy, flaky or overboard. You may not agree with everything said in these pages, but there is no doubt that you will still enjoy the read and, like me, will find much here to uplift and inspire you.This is a classic gem that is very quotable, too."
3,Audiobore,"The Prophet is one of my all-time favorite books. Gibran's writing is ingenious and The Prophet has definitely earned it's place in the canon of spiritual classics and masterpieces of the 20th century. Unfortunately, the audiobook version does not live up to the original text. Sparer's reading is blase' at best: uninteresting, uninspired and uninspiring ... plain dull. He merely read the words but put no heart or soul into them. I whole-heartedly recommend the book to everyone but the audiobook, no....I was very disappointed; I couldn't even finish listening. I wish someone would resurrect the Richard Harris recording -- that one was excellent!"
5,Peaceful,"Being a Lebanese,I have loved Gibran Khalil Gibran all my life & read most of his books in both English & Arabic.You do not loose any of the contents when going through the translation process.Reading the Prophet gives me inner peace with the hustle & bustle of our material life.It is a shelter & a refuge I always seek, when I am stressed out."
4,Insightful Poetry,I was surprised by the wisdom and insight of Gibran's writing. Soulful and poetic.
5,Stellar,I have heard much about this book and finally decided to read it. Wow! I could not put it down. A must for everybody seeking truth and poetry.
4,An Adaptation . . .,"For one who would prefer Truth coming from a source other than the King James Version, ""The Prophet"" is written with the voice of wisdom and the beauty of poetry. If there is a Black and White 'Truth,' one could easily seek it here in almost all the verses."
4,Insightful Prose,"I first became aware of Kahlil Gibran when I read a poem of his that was on the menu at my favorite Lebanese restaurant. Ever since then, I have sought out his books. The Prophet is my favorite. Several of the ""poems"" or passages are fully relevant to parts of my life. The book makes one feel good and inspired to do good for others. There is barely an aspect on life that the poems do not touch on-love, marriage, death and all of our own insecurities and doubts about people and life. This would be a good book to give to a friend who is going through a rough time, or just has unanswered questions at a certain point in their lives. The writing is lucid, insightful, and will be relevant for as long as time goes on.The drawings add to an already great work. At my favorite Lebanese restaurant, I not only found good food-I thankfully found Kahlil Gibran."
2,Not Satisfied,"when I order this book, I had no idea it would be a very small pocket size item. I thought I was ordering a regular size book, and I am disappointment with this item."
2,In the land of the blind...,"This piece of literature promises enlightenment but fails to deliver. Though the transient prophet indeed speaks eloquently and his words inspire deep reflection, they fail to impart true understanding. The initial discourse on love is riveting but what follows quickly descends into empty rhetorical musings which continue until the bitter end. The most entertaining aspect of this book is the artful use of language which almost masks the fact that the prophet indeed speaks but says nothing."
5,Stunning....,"I was feeling down and low recently and a friend gave me this book. I couldn't put it down and I was astonished at how beautiful it is. It made me see the logic of love, marriage, sharing, etc.... Reading it once is never enough. It's a real gem and i don't think i'm the only person who will highly recommend it."
5,This book truly reminds us of who we really are *,This book truly reminds us respectfully of who we really are - GTH/f
4,"Nice, but not original","Gibran was a great author and in this book he truly shines. I recommend this book to anyone, even if he/she is not into reading. The book is short but full of wisdom. I only gave it 4 stars because the idea of the book (and even the title) are taken from ""Thus Spoke Zarathustra"" which I gave 5 stars. So I didnt think it would be fair to give this one an equal grading. I actually recommend both books, but The Prophet is much easier to read, while Thus Spoke Zarathustra is deeper and more intelligent."
5,The Prophet,This book will move and inspire the stiffest of human beings. Recommended for anyone who craves inspiration in their day to day lives.
5,Life Changing,I was about 16 years old when I first read this. I own several copies (Home Office etc) This book changed my life. I do not follow any organized religion although I respect them all. This is just about the only sacred text anyone needs. And it cannot possibly contradict any traditional beliefs. And yet it is a Spirituality all on its own. I wish I could give it more than 5 stars but then I am not sure how many stars would do it justice.
5,The Prophet,"I love this book and have had several over the years--everyone should have a copy. I refer to it often, and am very pleased with this book recently purchased through Amazon."
5,incredible book,"I bought this for my girlfriend and after she read it a looked through it.and inside i found a deep insightful story telling us the secrets of life, love, and happiness, i would recommend this to anyone"
3,Awseome!,Given as a gift to my brother and it was well recieved. I would respectively recommend this item to others.
5,The Prophet,"Love this book. Every time I buy one, I give it away. This one is for me. The book arrived on time and in good condition."
3,quiet time.,This book was great in the 60's and it's great still. It makes you feel peaceful inside.It lets you stop and contimplate what you read. Good source of tranquility.
2,No Table of Contents,"The book is fine. Yet, I would not have purchased this version if I had known that it lacks a table of contents. Particularly for The Prophet, most readers want to be able to jump quickly to a particular section.I want to ""return"" this version and buy a more expensive copy that includes a table of contents.Being brand new to the Kindle, I will now see if Amazon allows a Kindle item to be retruned for credit."
1,Flawed Copy -- Typos On First Page,"I was greatly looking forward to reading this classic, only to be disappointed by the negligence of the printer. On the very first page of this paperpack edition (Copyright 2009 -- BN Publishing) there's a glaring series of typos:""The sea that calls all things untThen said Almitra o her calls me,and I must embark.""This should read (this taken from the Amazon ""Click to LOOK INSIDE"" feature):""The sea that calls all things unto her calls me, and I mustembark.""I don't want to ruin my experience by reading any further. I will attempt to get Amazon to give me a reputable edition."
3,"Poetic, philosophic prose","As he (the ""prophet"") awaits the ship that will return him to his home country after fourteen years of being absent, he begins providing answers in colorful parables to questions raised by the occupants of the city he has temporarily made his home. We follow this spiritual man as the loving townspeople seek him out for wisdom. There is ultimately great sadness when he departs.I would describe these writings as poetic, philosophic prose for daily spiritual living. There are many sound words, with a relaxed style, and a somewhat universalistic belief. It is okay.Lord's blessingsScott"
2,If you're looking for a tiny printed novelty you'll love this,"I've always loved The Prophet and I've read it many times. I gave away my last copy and was looking for a replacement. I purchased this copy only to find that it was a tiny novelty version of the book. If you're looking for something tiny to keep in your purse then this is for you. If you're looking for a ""real book"" then this is a joke."
3,Good Read,"Its a thin book, very readable and has interesting 1-2 page thoughts on various entities like anger, children, religion, speech, silence and its COOL.........reading. Ofcourse if one needs to imbibe the thoughts of the author, it has to be consumed slowly and perhaps revisited but leaves you pretty heady and clear about certain things."
4,"Excellent, HDMI works fine.","This was an upgrade from a Denon AVR-3200 for me, and it was worth every penny! It's got loads of great features like XM ready, HDMI switching, Denon Link, Audessey EQ, etc. I have a dvd player and a dvr hooked up to the HDMI ins, and the output going to my tv, and it all works fine. I have an Xbox, PS2 and a Gamecube connected to the component inputs and the signal is output over the HDMI, so I only need one cable to connect to my tv! Its got loads of surround options, and DVD-A and SACD sound great. The calibration microphone is included.I suggest the other reviewer have his cable box looked at, because the problem isn't with the Denon.I only wish that, for the money, this had THX Ultra 2. Other than that its great, highly recommended!"
4,Great except for the remote,"This receiver definitely upconverts analog to HDMI - I have an TiVo Series II (among other things) connected to it via S-video - with only a single HDMI cable to the television. I am also sending sound to 3 zones - and getting great results (Polk RTi speakers). Performance-wise, it is everything I hoped for when I bought it.It is a complicated unit - I used a professional installer. Additionally, the remote control is ridiculous - replace it with a Universal Remote. I never planned on using the remote that came with it, but rated it only 4 stars instead of 5 because of the remote and the level of complication involved in setting it up and understanding it."
2,"Ego, Get Away","This book contains no new information; it does, however, express it in a unique fashion. To anyone who has read self-help, psychology, or spirituality books, this book will likely be disappointing.Mr. Tolle gets directly to each of his points. He has no elegance of languance, no nuance, no finesse. His language is authoritarian and professorial. He conveys his message that the ego runs our lives and that we can enrich our lives by getting beyond the ego's boundaries in an understandable manner. However, I found the book's efficiency of language actually to be a distraction from its message.I would not discourage anyone from reading the book. The message is important. I simply prefer to read the message written by a better author."
4,Newly awakened!,"This is an excellent book, very deep and what Oprah and the Author are doing is unprecedented. Very good at holding a mirror up to your life and if you are present and open, you can take a very good look at yourself, and if necessary...change who you are...for the better of course."
5,Life changing,"Buy this book. Don't think about not buying this book. It has changed my life, and I believe it could change yours as well. It's easy to understand and pretty much answers every question you could want to know. I bought a copy for everyone in my life."
5,Tying-up so many loose ends,"Years of doubt, insecurity and years of an unsettled soul suddenly became exposed and revealed for what they are: Ego and the Pain Body. This short and wonderful book has changed my life in monumental ways and enabled me to embrace the present moment. No longer will I occupy my now with the past which I cannot re-live, or the future which I previously feared.Thank you, Mr. Tolle. I have never met you, but after reading this book I feel that I know you, and I'm absolutly convinced that you know me! Thank you for bringing meaning to the the many incomplete bits and pieces that were previously my life. Thanks for enabling me to finally assemble them and see that they show the true being I am, but also the magic of the World and Universe in which I live."
3,"Good, but wordy....","Another good book by Eckhart Tolle, but esoteric and a bit lengthy at times. I always gain from his writings, but my life is busy and I look for new information in more concise packaging whenever possible. My favorite book for finding your purpose is the Key to Living the Law of Attraction. It is simple, direct, and doable. More tangible tools for living on www.ddwatkins.com -good useful techniques.Jack Canfield's Key to Living the Law of Attraction: A Simple Guide to Creating the Life of Your DreamsGratitude: A Daily Journal"
1,Nothing New here. Same ol' lies.,"Nothing new in this book of Oprah's favorite conman. Tolle pretends that his pap is based on the Bible, but his citations are out-of-context and misinterpreted trite analogies. His claims are all part of the original lie - Genesis 3:5 ""No, God knows well that the moment you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like gods who know what is good and what is bad."" Same ol', same ol'."
2,All these was taught 2500 years ago,"What was mentioned in this book was taught 2500 years ago by the Buddha. The author basically rewrite everything that was taught by the Buddha. The topic on ego and the big I,the self, was nothing new. If you want to go back to the original source, I recommend that you read the teachings by the Buddha."
4,Good for the money,The contents of this book are phenomenal. From the very beginning you feel like the book was written for you. I have recommended it to everyone I know. This copy is paperback and you can't really lend it out to your friends or family when your'e done because you've highlighted every page. Good for the money.
5,A very insightful book! A MUST READ!,"Eckhart Tolle is an insightful, inspired writer who has much to say to today's world. Everyone should read this book and his first one, The Power of Now. He teaches so much to us all about how to think and what our ego's are doing to us.Thank you Mr. Tolle for a TRULY amazing book!"
5,"Fabulous, life-changing reading!",This book is easy to read and understandable if the reader has a basic knowledge of the subject. I'm already reading it for the second time.
5,Not Buddhism or New Agey preachy,"This is a book about experiencing life deeply. It is not a re-hashing of Buddhism or Vedic teaching. Tolle simply describes the experience of living a more subtle life, of experiencing the deeper values of life.This means more silence and less beliefs. And that is the effect of reading this book.While I was not impressed with the simplicity of The Power of Now, in this case the simplicity of New Earth is deep and transforming.Reviewers who are seeing religious beliefs here are seeing their own beliefs and not the effect of this book. This book is about letting go of beliefs."
3,A New Earth,"Guess I was not ready for this awakening. I'm in chapter 4 and I just don't get it. The word usage was hard to follow much less understand. I know people rave about the book and author. I do follow the Skype sessions. Listening to what other book clubs are getting out of this book which is great for them. I ordered the book with my eyes open, knowing it was spiritual. I will keep going but sometimes it is difficult.The book was received in perfect condition and delivery was quick. thank you."
2,Really Great,"I know that everybody knows that it is not possible to create a new earth...Mars is too cold, Venus is too hot, but Ecky Tolle lets us into a fresh way to interpret the old/current earth.Things like slow down, calm down, relax and calm down are all suggestions that he makes. For me this is tough, because if I slow down I will probably lose my job.Perhaps this book is better for people who have time to follow his steps. All to say, it is really good, and someday I really hope to nail all of my life's purpose by awakening.It would be interesting to see how this book would apply in war stricken or poverty stricken areas...I don't think it could.Anyways, this book is really good, and while I am having a hard time applying the lessons,or seeing how they apply, they are very intelligent and very well written."
4,book review-a new earth,"I have not finished the book yet,because you have to read it slowly and sometimes repeat the page to completly understand its purpose of discoving yourself and being truefull in your thoughts of ""who you are""..Its good reading and even if you only get one thing out of it,it will be one thing you have discovered about yourself..."
2,THE NEW EARTH,"TOLLE IS DELIGHTFUL; ALTHOUGH THE SUBJECT MATTER CAN BE DAUNTING. AS A SERIOUS STUDENT OF THEOSOPHICAL TEACHINGS, H P B WOULD BE PROUD OF HER SON, I SAY WHEN THE STUDENT IS READY THE TEACHER WILL APPEAR. BLESS HIM/HER THAT SHARES. THE SHIFT IS NOW!"
4,"This Book Speaks Truth, Yet IT is A Bit Heavy. Free Offer for My Book","I loved A New Earth and I truly believe that it speaks Universal Truth, however for those just beginning to look into Eastern Concepts it may be a bit daunting and heavy. I have written a book and released it recently that is said to be an intro to A New Earth that explains these principles in simple and introductory language. It is titled eastern Wisdom for Your Soul. To let you know i am not just trying to sell my book I am willing to give away a free E-Copy to anyone interested. Please visit www.RickSinger.org and request a book and I will send immediately.Warmest Regards and Thanks for Putting effort into Transforming this World.Rick"
4,Life Changing Reading,"If you have read the Power of Now you know how Eckhart Tolle can give your life peace and hope in a non judgemental way.In this book Tolle shows the current state of human developement and explains the limitations and inconsistentcy of thought.We currently live in a chaotic, insane world and this book can help."
1,GOES TO SHOW THE POWER OF OPRAH,I read a lot of books and this one really threw me. Hard to understand and only purchased because of the Oprah show. Gave up after 30 pgs trying to figure out what all the excitement is all about?Am returning back to Amazon. Is this all it takes to write a book?
1,dont even bother. very over rated,i found this book to be boring and a rehash of many books in this field of interest. i have not received any enlightenment from it. maybe that is to come when i least expect it. until then i do not recommend it. save your money.
4,Eckhart tolle is great !!,The book is irresistible. I finished book in a week. It is worth reading again and agian. Eckhart I belive has universal wisdom.Message is surely tough to practise but surely this is the real way to enlightment.
5,Everyone needs to read this book,"This book is extraordinary! Mr. Tolle is able to move beyond the norm insharing how our egos create exactly what we don't need. He stimulates themind and validates the critical need for our own individual consciousness changes. This is ""must read"" for anyone interested in everything from personal growth to world peace."
5,A new Earth,This book is so well written and precise! Easy to understand and there is so much info so that one can read it again and again!
3,A bit of a letdown after the first book,"I absolutely loved the author's first book, and hoped that this one would provide even more insights. Perhaps that was a little greedy of me. Much of the same material is rehashed here, but overall still a very interesting read."
1,huh? a new earth,"I really needed some uplifting message from this book. Deluded again. I felt like I had no connection with what Tolle was saying. It is like being in junior high and left out of the ""in"" group."
4,Better than The Power of Now...,"Eckhart Tolle, had an it right with The Power of Now, however, the book itself was not an easy read...many had to do book groups to discus and break down such a simple truth.He has redeemed himself with A New Earth. I am 1/2 way through but it is great to have the word out that our goal is to become more and more conscious. Bravo for his effort in getting the reader a little closer."
2,Not a spiritual book,"It would be a mistake to call this a spiritual book. I think it is a ""be happy"" pop psychology book with some spiritual generalities thrown into the pot. The author says that if you don't get it, then you simply are not ready to get it. That kind of ""logic"" is highly suspicious.This is religion for yuppies, divorced from any moral requirements, full of feel good nonsense. It is NOT Hindusim."
5,Recommended for anyone,"I read the Power of Now and this is along similar lines. It's an easy read. Helpful for anyone interested in bettering their quality of life. Hey, anything is better than the way you were."
5,Good Book - by Jan Simpson,If you are thinking about reading this book - then you should - you need to be ready for this book albeit most people just like reading a lot - this book is chalked full of information that you need to be ready to receive.Good ReadingJan Simpson
2,Life's purpose now awakened - hmm... really ?,"same old same old - philosophies from round the world once again in a new cover ...this book ... did not work for me (that's my ego talking!) ... but i take no offense if you are now awakened :-) good for you!!in any case what is in this book - you have probably already seen it, read it or heard it before! - you just don't remember it!!ok so what is the purpose of my life : ""To be happy and keep my loved ones happy"" - that's all that counts for for me and this really works - rest just follows.Smile a lot!!P.s : To be honest i did not finish the book (and that is rare!!) - I gave 2 stars because i think Tolle put in a lot of effort and because Oprah liked it - can't offend her!"
3,Difficult to enjoy,"I love the meaning of this book. I love the self help, self realization, self love, etc..that this book offers. That being said, I find this book as well as all of Eckhart Tolle's other books to be difficult to enjoy reading. For me, it seems to take him 4 pages or more to relay thoughts that could have been written in 2 paragraphs. I have trouble finding an enjoyable flow to these books therefore I really don't find myself getting much usefull information. I find watching him on television inspiring. Reading him, boring."
3,"Interesting to great concepts, sloppy evidence","""Mindfulness in Plain English"" is a much more convincing and actionable presentation of eliminating the ego, though Tolle's writing is certainly interesting. As a rational person, I found a number of his supporting arguments to be quite sloppy, which to me greatly diminished my enjoyment of his ideas."
1,I did not like it at all.,"The book did not turn me on.I thought it was more interesting,but I can always regift it............"
5,A Must Read,"Please, Please read this book. Tolle tells us about the final frontier, and how urgent it is that we individually go there. It has altered my life, and the life of many I know in a very positive way. It is truly an awakening for all, and deserves multiple readings. C.D. Brown"
4,Really makes you see things differently,"I did like this book and it made me see things differently. I could see myself in the pages. Maybe we take things to much for granted and don't get in the moment. It helps you to understand some of the things that you do and teaches you to live in the moment. I guess at times we all need to set back and really see what we are doing. Some people will not like this book or what they see. Some might not be ready to hear what it has to say, but if you are ready to explore yourself and your life, then read this book. I understood a lot about what I was doing and why."
2,Give this one a miss,I was rather disappointed by this book after all the hype about it being profound and amazing. I didn't find that it contained much information that I didn't already know.The writing style was difficult to understand and did not flow well. I stopped and started many times with this book as I just could not get into it.I agree with many of the other reviewers that there were no practical or useful tools or tips on how to apply any of the knowledge - there was sort of this expectation that you should just be able to do everything he told you to do. If you want something with practical ideas - read the Dark Side of the Light Chasers by Debbie Ford.
2,rambles on and on,"I give this book two stars because I agree with the basic premise that people should embrace the present moment. The problem is that the author repeats this basic idea over and over. While certainly some repitition is justified in order to get the point across, the repetition here rises to absurd levels. I think this book could've easily been written under 100 pages, but then, alas, it would be difficult to sell. Paul Gehrman, Author, Kaleidoscope"
2,Not quite there...,"I've always been a strong reader with a large vocabulary, but this book is so wordy and overdone it leaves me lost. I feel like he tries to make certain points but goes too far in trying to explain, in that you become more confused.It was so frustrating reading this book because I know that there are good ideas hidden in here, he makes them too much work to find and grasp."
3,a little deeper than I thought,you really have to read this slowly to understand the concepts he is talking about. I like elkhart tolle and I hope his ideas about slowing down and enjoying life catch on!
5,A new way of thinking,"A new Earth: Awakening Life's PurposeA completely different way of looking at the world outside and the world inside your head. This is all so personal. It seems amazing that a way of thinking in such a unique manner should be so intimate yet obviously universal. It changed my outlook on life. I was prepared to dismiss it, once I found out that it is on Oprah's book list as some of her recommendations are not to my liking - but I came to the book through other means. Quite unique.Linda"
5,Everyone should read whatever their beliefs,This book was recommended to me by two people and now I have recommended it to others. Whatever your religion or philosophy this book's essential message is one that every person needs to wake up to. It immediately has an effect which is cool because it is about the present moment and when I find I am falling off track I read it again.
5,Love it!,"A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose is the book that a read before The power of now.A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose (Oprah's Book Club, Selection 61)What can I say amazing!"
4,A Much-Needed Self Help Book,"Tolle says a lot of things in this book that will help everyone better understand themselves.It's a book that seems to talk to me, to me personally, every time I pick it up."
3,Professor Hutchins,"The book has some interesting ideas. The author is arrogant making statements such as what Jesus or Buddha really meant or what will happen to the world if we do not evolve. It is a shame for much of value is presented.His encouragements are good to see. I suspect he is a fine fellow, just a bit too full of himself.He tells us that danger lies in getting to attached to your ego. Now, now Mr. Tolle, aren't your opinions demonstration of an ego?Worth reading, but you might want to avoid the last few chapters.Ken"
1,Ego is not a dirty word,"This book is one long w..k. It tells you to get rid of your ego, intellect, personality, emotions, and opinions, and just let your ""spirit"" shine, through your beiged out physical presentation. For all people who want to be as dull and boring as Tolle, take this book's advice. That is, if you can make any sense out of it. Oh, that's right, you just have to read the words and let his ""Presence"" flow through you without rational comprehension...... (rolls eyes)Save your money, and listen to Skyhooks' ""Ego is not a dirty word"" (1975) for a cheezy corrective to this Oprah-recommended drivel."
5,A New Earth,"A New Earth was an excellent book but was very detailed and written in a lot of depth. You had to read the book for content only and then think about it after you read it. It is a book that can be read over and over again to realize the full import of the message. Mr. Tolle on Oprah's book review helps to clarify many of the questions left to the reader. If one wants to awaken with new ideas, this is the book to help you find your purpose in life."
5,A New Earth,Great book. But I must admit I have a hard time understanding some of it. But he explains that some people would have to reread the book to truly understand it. So far so good!!
1,Kindle version of A New Earth,"The Kindle version of ""A New Earth"" can only be advanced page by page, not chapter by chapter. I returned my electronic version for the paperback as this is not a book you read page by page. Plus, the paperback version is cheaper! Amazon was great about the return. Great customer service!"
3,Old concepts rehashed,Exactly like the old sixties book BE HERE NOW NOW BE HERE and Buddism with a dash of other religious figures. Nothing original.
5,Read again and again,This is a book to be read more than one time. Each time I pick it up I gain something new.
5,wonderful and refreshing book,This was a wonderful book that I'm rereading to get even more out of it. We need to spend time in the moment and be conscious.
4,easily one of the best of the genre,Very easy reading AFTER the first chapter. I found many insightful passages linking religion and common sense. It was refreshing.
4,Good Follow Up to the Power of Now,"A good follow up to The Power of Now. I wrote the following review about TPON and here it is repeated, but additional comments.Reading this book was like a condensed version of the many classes I have attended from my spiritual teacher. Eckhart Tolle presents difficult to comprehend subjects in simple to understand language. However, do not expect that this ""easy read"" will result in instant enlightenment. He sets the basics down, it is up to the reader to absorb and act upon the lessons.I always leave a weekend workshop at my spiritual teacher's ashram on a natural high. This book gave me that same feeling. It is a wonderful book to help guide you on your spiritual journey.A New Earth guides the reader further along the path with excellent commentary. The book is grounding. Good reminder to keep my ego out of my way!Author of the award winning book, Harmonious Environment: Beautify, Detoxify and Energize Your Life, Your Home and Your Planet"
2,I have not read the Power of Now..,"...So I only browsed through this book. It is a pseudo-philosophical babble. My inner world, my outer world. If people are old, then the inner world growths and outer world is less significant. Old people are savvy. Young people don't know the treasure they have within. Death is hidden in our western society. Other cultures admit decay and enjoy more life. A Zen master who accepts any false accusation without any denial, because he's in state of harmony with his inner world. And so forth and and so-on.The book can be shortened to two pages, perhaps.I am curious to read the Power of Now. I assume the author had a success for a reason. But the inspiration dried out in this A New Earth book. Some writers are of the one book type"
2,I can't give this one star ...boy this is scary !!!!!Buy this book!!!! I guess This means YOU,"Didn't anyone hear of Werner Erhard or EST What a rehash of everything of this genre ....Not saying that some info is not worth considering, but my God, the idea that this is life altering in itself is total BS"
2,Not Transformative,"I read this book and listened to the CD's on the advice of Oprah. If you have ever had any sort of deep personal growth experience, a spiritual awakening or experience in a twelve-step program, I don't think this book will help you add anything to your life. I felt Tolle missed the mark in many areas and had a haughty, condescending attitude. In my thinking and feeling, most people who have had a true evolutionary experience are humble and open minded. I agree that we overly identify with form, but so many others have said it better. If you are a true novice in self-examination, it may have a few points that will help you."
1,Horrible Product!,This book is so boring and the CD's they sent me where damaged...I am thinking of returning it.
3,"Spirituality for introverted, depressed and childless people","Although Tolle put his finger on something important, namely that our ego has too much influence over our lives, he pushes this to an extreme where our ego becomes our worst enemy.Living an egoless awaken life may be an interesting goal for an introverted childless man battling depression, as Tolle admitted he was, but it is not realistic for a parent with three children.Read the Book of Secrets by Deepak Chopra instead. With Chopra, spirituality is not a quick fix to all personal and global problems but a layered process where you don't have to wage a holy war within yourself to deny a fundamental part of who you are, your ego."
3,Not what I hoped for,"In general, I love Eckhart's message and work. However, in A New Earth, Eckhart spends most of the book rehashing and overexplaining ideas. If he wants his readers to reconnect and awaken to their inner beings, then he needs to return to the simplicity of writing that characterized his first books."
1,What?,"If you like meandering, unorganized, and pointless prose, this one's for you. What is the underlying theory of this book? What is the paradigm? Almost impossible to read."
2,Double talk,"Lots of double talk and hard to read. He implies that if you don't ""get it"" you are mentally under developed. Most is common sense."
2,Could not get through it,"Recommended to me by a counselor, but I never got past the first chapter. Writing was too dense and impenetrable for me."
1,Swimming pools....movie stars,"Want to spend time with Hollywood elites? Oprah, Tom Cruise, Kirstie Alley, Isaac Hayes, Jason Lee, Kelly Preston, Will Smith and on and on. Read this book, deny Jesus, and you can get autographs, drink beer, find out why L. Ron Hubbard said Jesus was a pedophile, whatever you like while you are burning in hell for eternity. This way to get ""doctrine"" out of your life is just an excuse to set your own rules and live how you want to live. There is only one way to salvation and it isn't through you. Jesus is the only way."
1,Pure Trash,"This is pure trash and a waste of your time but it is terrific, I'm sure, to people who are lost in this world."
4,A NEW EARTH..BY TOLLE,"THIS IS A RESPONSE TO YOUR SERVICE: FAST, BOOKS IN GOOD SHAPE, VERY SATISFIED.THIS BOOK IS BEING USED IN A READING GROUP. WE HAVE JUST GOTTEN STARTED WITH SOME INTEREST AND SOME SKEPTICISM. I THINK IT WILL BE A GOOD TIME.NOTE: MY SISTER'S GROUP IN CAMARILLO, CA, IS ALSO DOING THIS BOOK. IT IS ALMOST A ""CULT."" BUT A HARMLESS ONE."
5,Life changing,"If you are in the place to hear the wisdom and understand it, the truth within this book can change your life."
5,A New Earth,"This is the one you've been looking for to quiet the mind and find the real you that lies within. A very enlightning book that must be read in a still area so that you can soak up the meaning of what Eckhart Tolle is saying. If you're wanting to take that next step you've been longing for to become the more spiritual enlightened you, This Is It!A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose (Oprah's Book Club, Selection 61)"
2,Osho and Tolle,"Steve Right wrote ""In this book Tolle takes the teachings of Osho, krishnamurti, Buddha and the new non duality theory and tries to make them his own...""I agree with Steve. I would like to contact him. my email: v_stanca@yahoo.comIt is possible Eckhart just to tell words heard from Osho, without enlightment. A few from Krishnamurti, too...2* for Osho ideas, anyway...I wonder if he met Osho, or just read his words, like me...STEVE: What about Osho, did you meet him?"
2,Chauncey Gardiner Reincarnated,"They made a movie of this guy Tolle back in 1979 titled ""Being There"" with Peter Sellers. Tolle has done a miraculous ""reincarnation"" of the character, Chauncey Gardiner."
1,Another Oprah Brainwashing,"Just another lemming reaction to an Oprah selection. It's sad commentary that so many people will wait until she puts her approval on a selection and then rush to purchase it and then feel that they belong in the select few. If you want to improve your spiritual life try the one book that has always been the answer, THE BIBLE!!"
3,"Take the good from it, ignore the fearmongers - go to the source","This is a good book for those who want a western perspective on age old ideas into inquiry of the self and mans search for the divine.The Source of these ideas is from the Well spring of Hindu Thought (Santana Dharma) explored in depth by many other teachers such as Ramana Maharishi and Paramahansa Yogananda.It brings out the fanatics who see the wellspring of the divine in only one form, theirs - so when reading the reviews, take religious bigotry and narrow minded agenda's into account. If you happen to be one of those folks, don't bother... walk the walk and not the talk."
2,Hard to Read,"This book may have good points if you can get through the drawn out verbage, it was too deep for me."
2,nothing new-I would recommend...,"I received this book as a gift and I am not quite sure why it is a bestseller-I also received the book, FREE YOUR MIND by Anthony Stultz-All I can say is that the wrong book is number one-check it out for yourself and see."
3,Better be in the right mood to read it.,"Got it, read it when they were reading and talking about it on the show. Ready to give it away, cause my head is not into it. It has interesting points but I wouldn't read any of his other books."
4,One of my favorite books,My wife and I have recommended this book to all of our friends and family. It is simply inspiring! Eckhart Tolle reminds us of the endless possibilities we are capable of creating and achieving for ourselves.
3,Philisophical,"I don't get what the big hype is, however, I have read only the first 3 chapters. Reminds me of a college psycology class. Yikes! I vow to finish the book and take the course on Podcast at Itunes."
1,The endless market for snake oil,"When will enlightenment come to those want to believe more than they want to know. This kind of stuff is appropriate for sappy greeting cards or manipulative advertising but, in my opinion, little else."
1,"New Earth, But Not So New Information","Ok, so it may not be Buddhism repackaged, but it definitely is Spiritualism repackaged.The basic information and the Spiritual Laws reflected are worth knowing, but the book is bland. According the the author, if you don't derive benefit from it, it is the reader's fault. Gee, Echkart, I'm sorry I didn't live up to your expectations.I wouldn't consider the book a waste of time, but it lacked a fresh perspective to separate it from the pack."
3,Good but,A friend of mine recommended this book as one of the best books that they ALMOST read. They had purchased the book on Oprah's recommendation and started the book---really enjoyed the start but just could not get though it---they thought that they would get back to it some day. I was intrigued so I took the book out of my local library---I had to wait a few weeks---once again the power of an Oprah recommendation. I started the reading the book and was very impressed with his philosophy but knew that I had read similar and eminently more readable philosophies that asked us to be Aware and Awake---I recommend all of the writings of Anthony Demello as alternatives or further reading for those who semm to believe something is here but can not get through the stuffiness of this volume---Demello writes with a sense of humor and a heart of love. reading his work will inspire many. The three stars are for my affinity to Tolle's philosohy not the book.
3,This book won't change your life,"I read this book cover-to-cover and it didn't change my life. The ""teachings"" contained within are nothing new and spritually minded readers will best be served by continuing on their own faithful journeys. It doesn't hurt, however, to take in the message of losing one's ego and an evolution of thinking. Read it as a study the way you would read something on any topic, but don't read it with the notion that it's going to change your life."
5,Serious Reading,"This book is not for the casual reader. I found the first chapter difficult to grasp at first, but stayed with it and began to open up to the message contained in this book. I found it best to read this book in a quiet place with no distractions so I could fully absorb the words and meaning behind the words. It is not a book you fly through, but I am glad I bought it. I am also following the webcast on Oprah.com which is helping to understand the content even more."
5,A New Earth,"Having studied and read many books during the last 30 years about the inner self and truth, I find this book of Eckhart Tolle's to be the most important book ever written on this subject."
3,It takes a while...,"I was so disappointed when I began reading this book. The ""wordiness"" of the first two chapters nearly bored me to death. I felt as though Tolle was being repetitive in his message. As I slowly approached Chapter 3, although I didn't completely change my mind or opinion, I did get more ""into"" what he was saying. That's when it started to sound like more than a bunch of words. I'm not sure I'll get the awakening that Tolle talks about but I will keep an open mind."
1,Too Heady,I did not like this book at all. It was too heady and not an easy read. I dreaded having to do the obligatory reading it required of my waning intellect. It was too heavy for me.
2,Repetitive and unimpressive,"I have an open mind but I thought this book was too simplistic, redundant and terribly unmoving. I wish he included a section of the book that didn't suck."
3,Difficult read,"I have a BA from a Christian University and I find it a challenge to read more than about 3 pages at a time. It's worth sticking with, but I should have expected I couldn't zip through it like it was Twilight."
3,just ok?,It seems like an interesting book but still is slow paced it doesnt grab your attention right away. You have to be willing to wait for a little while.
1,"""new Earth""","I have found this book a very Large Let Down.The reviews from oprah were extremely Kind.Compared to ""The Power Of NOW "" this book is nothing!!The strength , the power are not obvious in this book!For People that ( have listened to or read ""The Power OF NOW"" this book is a true let down . The substance is not there in the Book ""The New Earth"".If you want to understand His writings read the New Earthfirst ( Then the powerful ) Power Of now next.My conclusion :No need to purchase the ""new earth"".Read The Power Of NOW !!!"
4,Powerful and life-altering in a simple way,"I love this book and highly recommend it to anyone interested in finding peace and happiness. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I was disappointed to find a lot of repeat material from the author's earlier awesome bookThe Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment. (I do see how the Power of Now ideas fit in with A New Earth.)Although some of the concepts are hard to grasp and are beyond me, the author's formula for creating a new earth consciousness is clear enough that anyone can benefit from it if they take the time. I greatly appreciate the simplicity of the practices he describes.I revisit the many highlighted (by me) passages from both books nearly everyday and still find them interesting and helpful. Eckhart Tolle rocks!"
1,Be careful people,"It is sad to see Oprah fall for this false teacher. Another new age prophet of easy living without accountability to the creator God. It reminds me of the wonderful quote from the movie The Usual Suspects: ""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist."" He is laughing at these suckers right now. Of course, nonbelievers will see this as foolishness, but so be it. Corinthians 3:19 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God's sight. As it is written: ""He catches the wise in their craftiness."""
1,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose,"This is an introduction to Hinduism for Christians/Non Hindu's with out giving due credit to Hinduism. If you really like this medley of Hindu Concepts then go straight to source...namely Hinduism and its sages, like Ramana Maharishi, Vivekananda, Shankaracharya etc."
2,A New Earht,"This item arrived in the time frame alloted. However, after going through the book I noticed that there were several chapters missing while having several repeated. The book was defective. This is the second time I have ordered something from here and there was a problem with missing chaptrs and chapters being repeated. It is making me cautious in ordering from here in the future."
5,"An eye opener, WOW","""An eye opener and no mistake"" as Sam Gamgee would say. Truly you will get this and be like WOW or you will not and just say wtf? I said WOW but some people will understand it and some wont. It changed my life completely."
1,A New Earth,"This book is creating a 'sensation' across the nation. I do a lot of spiritual reading and could not wait to delve into this book. However, I must say that it simply did not speak to me. I couldn't get through it. I even tried Oprah's on-line course with the author and gave up on it after the first session. Definitely not for everyone."
1,Not worth the paper on which it was printed...unless it gets recycled.,"What an awful waste of time! I feel like I have been swindled by the author. This is not new and it is not informative. I think what most people need to do to ""awaken"" is to simply take responsibility for their own lives. We don't need a watered down bible to tell us that. In fact, we don't need anything from the bible for a better life or to give us this breakthrough.Please do yourself a favor and remove this item from your consideration and go for a long walk. It is much healthier and more eye opening. And, if you have purchased this book do what I did after reading it and recycle it rather than passing it on to someone else."
5,A new dictionary for understanding how to unlock life and live for peace and love,"I can not read this book for you, or force you to read it. This is a choice that you make. The only person i can help is myself, and the only person you can help is yourself. One Love."
2,I won't buy another book from this seller,"HiCan't say it was seller's fault, but I received the book with 2 months delay and extra charge, not happy at all with this purchase.SamLondon"
1,A new Earth,I can barely understand the narration on my audiobook! I don't think I can hear anymore. I am very disappointed as it appears to be very popular but if I can't understand the narration what good is it.
3,Buddhism Lite,"I wish you could give 1/2 stars - this book is really a three and a half star rating for me.Although Tolle says he's not affiliated with any religion, this book is really ""Buddhism lite"". The concepts in this book weren't new to me but I thought that Tolle had an engaging style of explaining them that kept me interested. It was repetitive at times but I think someone who was learning about enlightenment and the principles of consciousness for the first time might need that repetition to reinforce them. Most of the book was theoretical - I would have like more concrete examples of how to implement the concepts in my own life. I did not do Oprah's online classes, perhaps those would have some."
3,Nothing New Here for Readers of Bhuddism or Taoism,"The insights Tolle talks about have been around for at least 2000 years. Basically he is talking about principles of Bhuddism and Taoism that have been studied and taught for generations. His ""enlightenment"" has been shared by adepts by the thousands.If you've never been exposed to these teachings, this will be valuable.If you've read any contemporary books on Bhuddism or Taoism or mindfulness, this will just be old stuff rewritten. It isn't new revelation by a modern prophet."
1,Not sure what the hype is about.,"We read this for our book club, and were very disappointed in it. We were really looking forward to it, but it doesn't seem to ""awaken"" anything. We followed what Mr. Tolle is saying, but the repetitive nature of his writing made it difficult to get excited about surging forward. Most of us wouldn't have read it in its entirety if it wasn't for the book club. During the discussion, we all agreed that we shouldn't shoot the messenger when the message is a good one. However, it was unanimous that his writing style was pompous and difficult to engage with. He turned a lot of us off when he said that if you didn't get it, you weren't ready for it, i.e. smart enough or enlightened enough. Given the level of education and professional achievement in our book club (engineers, lawyers, doctors, published author, business owners and professors), we didn't think that his book was ""above"" our ability. It was just poorly written."
2,Don't bother with this one,"After reading The Power of Now and listening to the book on CD several times, I greatly anticipated his subsequent books. I am very disappointed in his re-hashing the same information in his other books. In A New Earth, Tolle speaks with a strong disdain for his fellow humans. After a while I got tired of hearing about how ""sick"" and deranged we are. In Conversations with God, many of the same things are said, but you leave feeling uplifted and hopeful. Tolle's reading of his book leaves one feeling either depressed or irritated. Perhaps Tolle is so enlightened that he finds it difficult to be among his ""unenlightened"" brethren. To me, a sure sign of not being enlightened is judgment, and he seems full of that in this book. Not that I'm judging!"
5,Aiding My Quest,"I have been on a spiritual quest for 40 years always searching for enlightenment. Mr. Tolle's approach has been my focus for the last few years and I find it to be an excellent path. He has managed to translate all the truth into a clear message supported by the words of wisdom of many great spiritual teachers. It's a simple message. No need to seek enlightenment, we are already there. Always have been...always will be. The challenge is finding awareness of the actions of the ego...sometimes uncontrollable...and separating those actions from our true self which is part of the unmanifested. It's like we're Dr. Jykell (the unmanifested) and Mr. Hyde (the ego).The concept of the New Earth is something that I have felt for a long time. We humans as a species are evolving to the next level of being where awareness of unmanifested and the ego will be more balanced as a result the insanity we see all over the planet will start to dissipate revealing The New Earth which is already there."
3,A New Earth,This book had some good points but all in all I found it slightly hard to follow. I felt that if you followed the advice of the author you could very easily become indifferent to everything around you. Perhaps I wasn't totally grasping the book in its entirety but as I said I did find some of it rather hard to follow
5,Review: A New Earth,"This is by far the best book I have read on managing your mind and therefore your life. I read it twice to make sure I didn't miss anything, and I never read a book all the way through a second time. I bought copies for my college age daughters and they are now reading it. I know this is a very strong statement, but I believe it is the most important book published since the bible."
2,Unnecessarily wordy and shallow,"Unnecessarily wordy and shallowI have read many books on topics such as this and I was disappointed on how complicated the author tired to make the subject. It wasn't until page 72 that a simple sentence finally rang through all of the noise, and that ""shining through"" was very rare in this book. I hope that people don't miss the simple truths, a simple awareness and the simplicity of Being."
1,The new Earth,"I thought this book was very difficult to read and wondered what all the fuss is about. It had some good points, but a lot of it was just filler."
1,"more ""I am a God"" new age junk","Let me save you some time and money. Here's what the book says... Blah,Blah,Blah, ""think postive"" Blah,Blah,Blah ""I can create success and money and health with positive thoughts"" Blah,Blah,Blah. That about sums it up!"
4,Eckhart is a Prophet for Peace and Spiritual Awakening,"Love's Secret Live Your Life in LoveWhen we are in touch with our purpose in life it is easy to give and share love. Eckhart is a wonderful writer with an authentic voice of integrity. He is in touch with his purpose to awaken a New Earth to it's spiritual connection. Just like his book The Power of Now, in A New Earth, we are reminded to reconnect to our spiritual essence, and spend time in silence. As we deepen our connection to this spiritual essence we are guided to the path of our life's purpose.I would recommend this book to anyone who is feeling overwhelmed with life and wanting to reconnect to their spiritual connection. Eventhough this connection cannot be found outside us, this book is an excellent guide to take you on your journey."
1,Dr. Phil Meets Aristotle,"I tried. I really did- to get through this book and see the relevance of it and find out what all the hoopla was about. But the whole thing was beyond me. If I were to write this book, it would be one sentence long, a quote from the Bible ""Humble yourself before the Lord and He will lift you up"". No pop psychology wrapped in philosophical jibberish for me."
1,Huh? Totally useless waste of money,This was a total waste of time and money. I never did figure out what he was attempting to say beyond his own egocentric rambling. Junk!!!
2,If I read one more thing about ego I will go insane,"I guess I'm one of the people who get absolutely nothing from this book. I purchased this book with high hopes, but after the first four chapters I couldn't convince myself to keep reading. I don't really get how this book is supposed to be revolutionary or life-changing. It better much rehashes things I've already heard before.. I wouldn't wait my money on this book...Sorry"
3,Concentrate,This book is a difficult read. There is some pretty heavy concepts in it. Perhaps to some it may not seem that deep but to me it did. I will have to read it again to get the full message the author is trying to convey. It does have an intersting veiw however and I would think one could eleviate some stress in their life if they could just live in the here and now. Deal with life moment to moment.
2,A New Earth:Your Life's Purpose,"I am finding this book very ""heavy"" reading. Eckhart is the ultimate intellectual. I will press on reading the book and hope I can get most of his message. RPB"
3,The New Earth,This book gives a completely different idea of 'how we exist' in this universe. If seems very difficult to understand AND apply.
5,a new horizon on the earth,"I am/is part of the movement of new consciousness, which I became aware through this book from Eckhart Tolle. This book is the culmination of human consciousness; the flowering, the sunrise over the mountains.Thank you,I love you."
2,Eckhart Tolle: Awakening to your life's purpose,"I have not received this book and it's been a long time since I order it, maybe it's a problem in the mail office in Mexico or who knows. Thanks."
1,No New earth.,"i have read nearly all of Tolles books. All have been incredibly disappointing. This one probably the most disappointing.I understand the reviewers below, some who have not finished the book but have been hooked on the future promise of better things. ( Like a horoscope). Had there been no other books on the market of exactly the same nature before tolle started writing then I would have probably enjoyed some aspects. But really there is nothing new here. Certainly no New earth. That is another fantasy, living in the future idea. The reincarnation idea is also not new and Hindus have practised this for centuries. Obviously new readers will be impressed but those who have searched a little themselves will see the lack of substance in this book before the end. I could not even pass it on to someone else. I thought that would not be a nice thing as i found it so poor in the end."
2,Like Nailing Metaphysical Jell-O to the Wall,"Sorry, maybe it's just me but I just don't get it. I'm more of a practical bent but this book required slogging through a whole lot of vapor to get anything out of it.There are books you read where you have a hard time putting them down. Then there are books you have to force yourself to finish. ""A New Earth"" fell into the latter category for me. I had heard much of the Oprah-cized hype over the book which I met with high expectations.At the end, though, it seemed over-reaching in its quest for spiritual profundity. Be mindful. Be in the moment. Be a human being, not a human doing.You could have boiled it down to that and spared us all about 280 pages."
1,Eckhart Tolle,"Hated it.Found only a paragraph here and there that I could relate to, otherwise it was boring and so deept in parts that it didn't make sense and i found myself skipping over most of it."
1,A New Earth: Boring and Worthless,"This is the worst book I've read in a long, long time. Basically he takes already known Buddhist ideas and presents them as his own. This book is not ""new age"" like I was led to believe before I bought it. It's a Buddhist book with Buddhist ideas.This book did absolutely nothing to ""awaken"" me to my life's purpose.If you want to find your purpose, read something like the book ""Earth Angels"" or ""ET: 101"". Those are two fantastic books.I regret buying this book, and warn you: don't buy it if you don't like boring rehashed ideas. Don't waste your money."
1,Waste of money,This book is a total waste of money for any person who has a mind to think for themselves. Any self-assured person would be hard pressed to read this blather. Others needing something to grab hold to to keep themselves afloat might think it's a great read. This was something a group of us heard tooted by a celebrity and we wanted to find out what the big deal was about. We were saddened by the hype leading up to this publication and knowing so many will be taken in by this author.
1,common sense,"I could not get through the first chapter. To me, if you have common sense you don't need to read this book-because that is basically what it entails. Don't bother. I'm surprised at Oprah, but then again-not really."
5,A Life instruction book,"A must-read for every Human(form) Being(formless)... Some people receive gifts i.e. ""seeing and experiences entities, being prophets, etc."" and most people awaken from suffering (the human condition.)I was given this book years ago, and picked it up at the right time in my life to finally start reading it. Start from the beginning, or open it up randomly and open your mind to the information that isn't new. These aren't new thoughts, they are facts of what is already in your existence.Watching the Tolle classes for A New Earth on Oprah.com (search Tolle) and watch and pay conscious attention to how each lesson (90mins long per class) is applied and can be applied to specific experiences happening in your life. To listen and read is useless unless you are making the conscious effort to practice.If you're new to awakening and practicing consciousness, it will feel tiring at first, but it get easier and easier..."
4,Review of A New Earth,This builds on the content of the Power of Now and Stillness Speaks but gives a context for the messages from these books. There is great comfort and hope from A New Earth in its messages. This book gives the theory but also practical suggestions in how to apply its messages to your own life and how to wake up and live now. Very powerful. I also listened to this book on CD and found that medium to be an interesting alternative.
3,This is a primer for those just beginning on a spiritual journey.,"At the beginning of any new spiritual journey you don't have or get as many pieces of the puzzle as you might if you'd been on the path looking for a while. For those who are more spiritually ""advanced"", a more appropos book might be Robert Scheinfeld's new book, Busting Loose From the Money Game, a book that uses money as a segue into the whole issue of spirituality. People either love that book or they think Bob's a nut. But then, many newly discovered spiritual principles and laws of the universe are laughed at in the beginning. I invite you to compare the two books and make up your own mind. I've done that, and it's okay with me if I'm considered a ""kook""."
1,A TOTAL JOKE!!!,"I think I've found my true calling in life. Create a joke of a new age cult and get a self absorbed talk show host to peddle it and then the sheep will line up to purchase it. I couldnt get through chapter one. Please, a moment of silence for everyone throwing their money away, feel the oneness with your fellow sheep. I wish there was a zero star option!!!"
1,Very dissapointed,"I was surprised at how bad this book was. I have only gotten through the beginning... I agree with the premise, but thought it would be more to the point."
1,A new Earth,I never received this book. Money was taken out of my account and the book never came. I contacted the vendor and never received a reply. Very disappointed!!! I always buy from amazon.com and couldn't believe that this situation could possibly happen.
2,Boring,"I found this cd very boring. The writers has a mono tone voice that never shows any excitement or expression. It's really hard for me to sit through listening to this cd. This is my first bad reveiw on anything on Amazon. What the writer talks about might be helpful, it's just the way it is delivered that is bad."
1,When does he give us the cool-aid?,"All that came out of this book was...cult! It's extremely esoteric and makes you think that the almighty ""egoless"" eckhart has the way to a better world. But please do not be fooled just because oprah sells him on her show to make her billions. How does he know what my life's purpose is? This book is for people who are vulnerable and unstable...and he recognizes that. He is taking advantage of people who can't see through the B.S and making a profit from it. It's funny when you see people defend him, because they sound EXACTLY like him. Using the same phrases and words as him which is another sign of CULT behavior. In a cult there is usually someone running it. He tells you how to think and what to believe (brainwashing) tells you that your mind is insufficient (brainwashing) then takes your money. But people will always defend him because they've given themselves up to him. Just be aware people!"
1,A New Earth,Confused about biblical principles. Not recommended. The bible is the best place to awaken to your purpose.
2,A New Earth,Difficult to follow---having a had time reading it. Material is interesting but I have to read some sentences more than once to grasp what the author is saying.
1,Is Tolle Enlightened Or Just Egotistical?,"In some ways, I liked this book because it offered a ""somewhat"" different and simplistic way teaching people about Buddhism. The problem is that true Buddhism is many faceted and Tolle seems to have forgotten or has never known that fact. One of the problems in my opinion, with this book was that the author seemed to ramble on and on and on. He appeared to recant events and insights that didn't really pertain to anything except his belief in his own sense of self worth. The author's life, in my opinion does not illustrate an example of life's lessons learned but instead exemplifies only the fact that his opinion is based on the fact that he is oh, so perfect and oh, so enlightened. I think not!"
1,Horrid! I'll never read another Oprah book again!,"Tolle, a self-appointed guru to the masses, drones on and on and takes a dozen pages to say what could be said in a sentence. It amuses me that he starts the book in the first chapter saying that the book will change your life, and if your life is not changed, then you weren't ready for his wisdom! CYA"
1,crack...,"...that's what I needed to get through this book. tolle refers to beautiful imagery to cover hopeless ""paths"" to emotional freedom. as a matter of fact, if we followed all of his precepts i would be surprised if our guts didn't spill out on the sidewalk. he has learned the right phrases to hook the masses, i must say. spit out the hook while you can. swim the other way. just say no."
5,Very insightful - well worth reading - spend time with it.,"This is one of those well written books that you can easily agree with intellectually, but takes some work to make part of your everyday life. Has helped me enjoy life more, reduce stress, and embrace special moments everyday. Can be read and re-read. I still re-read a few pages every day.A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose (Oprah's Book Club, Selection 61)"
5,A New earth,Both my wife and I thought that this was one of the most fabulous books we have ever read. It has changed the way we look at everything around us. We just don't realize what a little box our EGOs put us in! Reading this book will make the serious reader really think about everything in their life and will help them realize that there is another way to live.One other thought ... my wife likes to READ books - I LISTEN to books - together we were able to share our experience - and grow in our thinking and living together!
5,A New Earth,"The book is wonderful, insightful and even better when you also follow Oprah and Eckhart's 10 week podcast discussing the content in depth."
5,Being,"A no nonsense explanation of the ""truth"" of the way things are that can be an extremely welcome ally to anyone wishing to untangle themselves from the weight of habitual self-identity."
5,Great Book!!,This is a great book and I highly recomment it. I read it in one day and gave it to my sister-in-law to read. She agrees with me that everybody should read this book.
3,Undecided.,"This was not a quick read for me. I am almost done with it, and I still don't know what to think of it. It makes you question your every thought."
3,A New Earth,I felt it was difficult to read. Too many words to really understand the meaning. But going to continue to work my way thru it. I enjoy ordering from Amazon but recieved a shipment yesterday and was shocked at one of the books I ordered. I had NO idea that a book I paid over $30+ for did not have any story line on Prince..........its mostly a coffee table book with pictures and not what I had expected at all. Very disapointed.
5,"Review on A new Earth, Awakening to your Life's Purpose","I found this book heavy going at first. While reading the first four chapters I felt like saying, ""I get the point, get over your own ego man"", but I think he realised I got it at this stage and he took off. I really did laugh out loud reading this book. He's spot on about the ego. It's so easy to see it in everybody else but he really shows it in yourself. Think everybody should have to read this book before you're let loose on the earth. Excellent."
2,Hard Read,I had a hard time getting into this book and finally had to put it to the side as I just couldn't finish reading it. It was one of those books I just couldn't connect with.
3,Love this book ..but...,"I love everything E. Tolle writes and i always feel good after reading one of his books. But alas, that feeling quickly fades when i have ""life"" to deal with. I recently found a book on amazon that blew me away and was far more practical. It's called Live Like A Fruit Fly."
3,Thought provoking,I honestly have not yet made it through this entire book. It's not the easiest read as it definitely is thought provoking and not something to take lightly. I definitley feel it's probably best read as part of a book club rather than just on one's own.
4,I am listening to the audiobook.,"It was a little slow to get into it. The author has somewhat of a monotone and it took some effort to pay attention, but by the end of Chapter 1, I was getting the message and I can't wait to listen to the rest of it."
5,"Eckhart Tolle's ""New Earth"" is a great book!","This was a difficult read, Tolle is SO PROFOUND in this book, but it definitely makes you look inside of yourself and think very differently of the world around you and what part you play in society. Definitely a good read!"
4,enlightening,I bought the book which was recommended by Oprah because of my longtime interest in/and psychology studies. It is excellent. I have been aware of living in the present as opposed to wasting our present moments living in the past or wasting our present moments thinking about the futureand that it will finally bring happiness or whatever you are looking for. Eckhart Tolle expands upon this. He also gives great insight into the difference between Spirit & Ego. Tolle himself says (in the book) that some people will not understand it or are not ready for it. This is so true ...the odd bitter critic has come out and clearly has no comprehension of it. Opinion by someone that Oprah was trying to launch her own 'religion' also just shows extreme ignorance...and is laughable.Read the book.
3,A disappointing purchase,"The promotional information caught my attention; 'Awakening to your life's purpose' which made me quite excited to receive this book. I did not know it was on Oprah's book list so this came as a surprise. I must admit I am quite disappointed. Maybe it is useful to put an age old spiritual concept into contemporary terms, 'the ego', but spirtuality is far more than just this. For those putting a first foot on a spirtual path, yes it has merit but if you are widely read and are looking for something mind expanding, well, make your own mind up but don't hold your breath. It is more pop psychology and self help than spiritual and there are far better books to guide you to your life's purpose."
2,New Earch,"The author is more or a philosopher than most ""How to Books"". I found it very hard to follow what he was trying to get the reader to do to make their life easier."
5,A life changer,"Very few things in life affected me the way this book did. It literally transformed the course of my destiny. After three readings since 2008,it remains at my bedside and I still recommend it to everyone I know."
1,BIG WASTE OF TIME,"First, this book mentions nothing about how to wake up to your life's purpose. I spent weeks getting through the audiobook version so I do not know how anyone actually read this nonsense. His voice is so monotone, his accent is annoying and he never has any inflection. It was as if he was reading instructions for installing a piece of machinery. I painfully got through his drivel hoping there would be some moment of sense or that ""A Ha!"" moment from a profound statement but it just is not there. He spends 9 chapters talking about the ego, none of it based on fact or experience. Finally he mentions something practical of how a person can help themselves with this knowledge but that is all is was...a mention, and back to the mindless droning. There are tons of better New Age self help books that are shorter and more insightful than this nonsensical rambling. This might be better categorized under psychosis training than self-help. You have been warned!"
1,"An alternative to Christianity, where God is Me","Simply enough, Tolle's book is so attractive and popular because it removes the distractng reminder of a God who loves us enough to die for us, but who also loves us too much to acquiesce when we deliberately choose to spend Eternity apart from Him. Follow Tolle's philosophy and you'll break the second commandment; namely, you'll make a god in your own image (yours!) God wants for us what Tolle's book supposedly offers, but He is the only one who can get us there."
1,Be careful!,"This book teaches that there are many ways to God which is a lie straight from the pit of hell. This book is very misleading especially to Christians. Read your bible. Stop trying to better your flesh and live a ""worldly"" life. The bible tells us to die to our flesh and live for Jesus! The bible is very clear that there is ONLY one way to God and that is through Christ Jesus! Satan would like nothing better than to further this kind of Eastern mysticism and pull you away from the Truth which is Jesus. Please stay away from this type of unbiblical worldview. It can leave you eternally separated from God."
5,14 copies to share so far,"I was quite resistent to some of the subjects of this book on the first reading, And I am now reading it for the third time. Each time I'm gaining new insights. This is the first Tolle book I have read. The profound effect this book's message has had on me and people around me made me choose to purchase 4 copies for family, then another 4 for friends and now another 4 for presents. Having been a seeker of truth most of my life, and having read many books with a spiritual message, I found this book helped getting beyond some ingrained stumbling blocks. Let me add, that the books given out were given with the option to read or not to read. So far I am aware of immense insights this book has instigated in several people, whose relationships and ability to accept life as it is has greatly grown."
2,Pompous and self-righteous,"Man, this author is full of himself. Every other philosopher and religious tradition has it wrong, according to Tolleson.Lots of philosophers have ideas and manage to share them without the wholesale dismissal of every other idea. Why does Tolleson have to state that everyone else is wrong and he is right? Somehow, it reminds me of those folks who are never open to discussion on any point... you know who I mean. Anyway, I mostly hated this book, in spite of the few good points that he made just because it is so pompous and self-righteous. I guess I missed why Oprah recommended this book."
2,Hard to Follow....,"Hey I was game for some change in my life & thought I'd pu this book & my flag Pen and couldn't wait to start reading.I was reading some parts over & over again and and I Didn't know what he was tying to say & I stopped reading it after awhile,I may try again but for now my brain needs the rest. I agree if you do get this book read with someone,at least to confirm that UR not crazy if you don't get it the first 7 times,the ""Flags&Highlighter; should have tipped Me & My Ego off that it was deeper than my afternoon naps.I gave it 2 stars because I only got 1/2 of what I read.."
3,I much prefer Steiner and Hicks' works,"I was excited to hear about this book, and my wife picked up a copy. I was really disappointed to find that it was full of lush generalizations and a great deal of 'pop' new age thought. It continues to astound me that so few people pay attention to Rudolf Steiner (who wrote 100,000 pages of clear, original, and decisive thought on the most wide ranging spiritual concepts) and yet fall head over heels for someone like Tolle. All the best to those who pursue this path, but I think the path of platonic dialectical ascent outlined in Hicks' ""The Shattering Light of Stars"" is much to be preferred to this."
3,still trying to get through the book,"I have had this book for some time... and am still trying to get through the first half....I had great expectations for it... but it seems to be a comprehensive collection of new age ideas rolled into one place...it is good mind you, and what he says it took me years of reading and thinking about on my own... it's just that so far, nothing I had not figured out on my own has been presented... nor a hint of what my 'life purpose' should be..."
2,A New Earth Book,Another preach advice to you book. Has some good advice but found it rather boring reading.
4,Great Refresher,"Even though this may not be the first time I have been exposed to the thoughts/prinicples in this book, its's a great reminder to keep me on track."
5,Good Teachings,This is a book everyone that is at a crossroad in their life should read.It helps you to look at life in a very different way and THINK about your life as it is right now.
4,"new thoughts about ""new earth""","This is a book that can be enjoyed by persons of all genders and all walks of life. Persons with advanced degrees in psychology and social services will find very little that is new and thought-provoking, but the book speaks to a number of persons in the general population. It is also quite enjoyable to take part in the weekly discussions of the book with the author and Oprah Winfrey that are available on our computers. I think that we will see much more of the phenomenon of world wide computer participation in the future, and this book was a good vehicle to ride into the future."
4,"Good, but with some repetition from earlier books.","Interesting, thought-provoking reading that included concepts from his earlier book, ""The Power of Now."" Easy-to-read style, but I would have preferred chapter summaries, or lighting of important concepts rather than the narrative-style approach."
4,Awesome!,Love this book. It changed the way I saw and lived my life. The most important piece for me was recognizing what he calls the 'pain body' and how that effects us when we are wrapped in it. I've never heard it described so well.
5,Tolle's Book - Inspiring !,"A great book to be read carefully , over and over again , in order to understand the spiritual contents of it and to prectice the life changing wisdom ."
3,Brings back the 70s.,"It's strange how things keep coming back. This book could have been written in the 70s or 80s. I really liked it, even tho it's old hat. My kids recommended it and I had to laugh because I tried to get them to read books like this way back when. Of course, they wouldn't. Well, you know, if Oprah says it's worth reading, then it IS worth reading. It's a good reminder for us older folks.SanJo"
4,Buddhism + western psychoanalysis = be here now,"By being present and aware (being pure consciousness) in each moment,I can neutralize the ego, that mental invader, made up of automatic, repetitive, unhappy thoughts, that activates in my mind, all the time.From the silence of consciousness, I look at my thoughts, continuously flowing, reopening every day my old wounds.I am not those thoughts, those psychic invaders, and the emotions and suffering they cause.I am pure, peaceful Consciousness and I am observing them.In the Now, they fade away and I am peace, true joy and happiness (some times!!)."
3,Oh Bother,"I haven't found my life's purpose--except maybe to go live in a cave so that my big ego doesn't further ruin anyone else's life or my own. Isn't that my ego taking over? Yes! This book makes me feel like a big wart, like I shouldn't have been born so I could have spared the world from my being. I am having a hard time getting though it. But other people think it's fantastic. I just hasn't been earth-moving for me."
5,An important book of our time,"Eckhart Tolle writes an important and inspirational work in A New Earth. He describes the higher potential available for humanity if we but awaken to our life purpose.This is an important book on a number of fronts. Firstly, it postulates a vision for the greater potential of life on earth, that we can focus on and work towards achieving. Secondly Tolle outlines a way to get there.Given the shambles of the world we live in, with ever increasing problems arising from unenlightened solutions implemented by unenlightened decision makers, this is a people's book with some insight into how we can best create the better world ourselves.Nicola Grace, Author ofDiscover What You Are Here To Do: Follow The Clues, Find Your Path"
5,"Excellent, with one caveat","There are other good, detailed reviews here so I won't repeat them. In short, I think this is an outstanding book that will appeal to people who don't easily relate to ""typical"" spiritual work (e.g., agnostics, atheists). If you haven't been exposed to Tolle's work, I think it would be best to start with The Power of Now to get a solid basis for his concepts, but that isn't critical for enjoying this book.My one caveat is sometimes the quality of writing could be improved, but the importance of the message takes precedence."
4,Would an editor help?,"There are many excellent reviews elsewhere. This is a suggestion. Perhaps Mr. Tolle would benefit from an editor. A competent editor could smooth out Eckhart's writing and eliminate some of those ""which is to say"", ""in other words"", ""that is to say"", ""as it were"", ""strictly speaking"", ""one goes so far to say"", ""which means"", ""we could even say"", etc. A good editor could make some of the writing less amateurish. Perhaps Mr. Tolle is not ready to have someone alter the words of the ""Master"". Has he become enamored with his own musings?"
1,Let's Call the Whole thing off.,"When it comes to reading, the American public appears to be as helpless/hopeless/naive as vis-a-vis the goings on in politics. This is born out both by the millions of copies gobbled up following our female Messiah's (Oprah) endorsement, as well as the flocking to the new male Messiah (Obama). It's time to change the Gershwin lyrics to: ""Oprah, Obama - let's call the whole thing off""."
1,A New Earth Read,"I would not recommend this book. I ordered it to read for myself what Oprah is promoting and teaching. The only New Earth there is going to be is when Jesus comes back as he has said he would and he will, and it is not to be found as this book promotes. How sad."
2,Overrated,"While this book was simply written and gave some good insights, with all the hype surrounding it I found it dissappointing. It basically came down to living in the moment and putting your ego aside which is good advice."
2,new age fluff,I have read the first 2 chapters and it just seems to be New Age feel good fluff. It definitely is not what I anticipated. I listened to the second webcast and felt the same way. Disappointing
1,Audio versoion unbearable,"My rating is based on the Audio version of this book. I did not read the book - I was an idiot and bought the CD. I could not even get through one CD. The reader is sooooo monotone. It may be a good book,just don't waste your money on the CD. Sounds like a computer speaking to you. Unbearable."
3,Interesting introduction to Tolle style Buddhism,"Tolle explains his version of Buddhism in this interesting, but lengthy read. If you are in search of ""Your Life's Purpose"", you are unlikely to find it in this book.If you are interested in Buddhism, there are better books available here on Amazon including ""Buddha: A Story of Enlightenment"" by Deepak Chopra."
3,Not sure yet...,"This is not a book I would have chosen on my own. It needs to be read slowly & at times, I had to re-read paragraphs to completely understand what the author is trying to convey. Since I haven't finished it yet I'll reserve a recommendation but to date, there's enough food for thought to keep me reading."
1,"If you didn't understand much of this book, you're not alone.","I had high hopes for this book. I had read great reviews. I made a special trip to buy the book and took it home to read it -- and was very disappointed that I couldn't understand much of it.There is good stuff in there. The pages are sprinkled with references to Buddha, Jung, Sartre, Krishnamurti, et al, but here and there I had to go around sentences like ""Any life-form in any realm--mineral, vegetable, animal or human--can be said to undergo 'enlightenment'"". and just leave them behind like rock outcroppings in a plowed field.Part of my trouble, I think, is that Mr. Tolle makes up his own meanings for words. I get stubborn and refuse to change my original understanding of a word. Part of my problem may be that my expectation is that if I find ""THE TRUTH"" that it will be presented in a simple format, with a synopsis at the end of every chapter and an index and glossary at the end."
2,Not the miracle it's touted to be,"If you're one to blindly believe whatever you read, this book is for you. It gets a bit cheesy for those of us who tend to question and analyze that with which we're presented. It does have some good ideas, and I feel like I gained a bit from reading it. But there's no way I'm going to ever say to my significant other, ""What you just said really activated my pain body."""
2,A very difficult book to read,"I had very high expectations for this book but when I received it and started reading I found it was VERY! difficult to read. It was difficult in that, after reading about 100 pages I felt there was almost no substance. It just seems to go on and on and on without a point being reached. Maybe its because Im a bit older now but, I like books that come to a point. Get to meat of what you want to say, support it, and be done with it. Dont talk it to death.I think that is book says something important. I also think it could be summed up faster and supported better and still only be 100+ pages in length."
2,Waiting for the awakening,"I'm almost done reading Eckhart Tolle's, ""A New Earth...."" and I'm still waiting for the enlightenment or ""A-Ha"" moment. It's pretty basic theology 101, along with some ""pop culture"" pep talk all while breaking down what the ego is and means. I have read past pop self-help books about people needing to ""Lose the Ego already.""At times, the language is a bit hard to transfer to everyday language, as it speaks a bit ""above the reader."" However, it's a good reminder what Jesus' beliefs were and how we can all be much kinder to each other.I just never got that ""awakening"" that Oprah and many are buzzing about. If it's good for others, that's great though. I just didn't get much out of it personally."
2,Make your own decision - but not for me.,"From my POV a lot of the content in this book is a rehash of Buddhist writings and other prior well established works. While I have found enlightenment in the work of Lama Surya Das and others, I find this book to be banal and anything but enlightening for myself. If others find enlightenment in this book, fantastic! The real me was not happy with the content of this book and I know that according to Mr Tolle that the content doesn't really matter anyway. I do agree you need to find a place in your life where you know yourself and 'who' you are. I just personally did not care for the style of the writing and much of the content. I think I would find more enlightenment in Grimm's Fairy Tales or Dr. Seuss."
2,Tolle's ego must have made him record this book,"While Mr. Tolle makes quite a few intriguing and interesting points in ""A New Earth,"" one has to wonder why in the world he chose to read the book himself for audio. He is a horrible reader with an extremely dry, monotone delivery. Ego is the only reason I can think of for him being his own reader. Ironically, the sole purpose of this book is to help the reader/listener to overcome the ego and achieve a more conscious and aware Present. I think Tolle has some severe ego problems."
5,fast service,"The book was brand new and came quickly. I was pleased. I think the shipping charge was too high, however."
4,If you like this...,there is a new book out called Wake Up to God's Word by Mary H. Reaman that makes great companion reading with Tolle's A New Earth and offers practical ways to apply what Tolle says about ego for one's spiritual transformation.Wake Up to God's Word: Exercises for Spiritual Transformation
5,A New Earth,I have all three of Eckhert Tolle's books and found this one to be his best and most enlightening. It is easy to read and you'll not want to put it down. I've also been following the classes online on Monday nights. They're an incredible experience - to be part of the consciousness raising of the entire universe at the same time.
5,A very satisfied customer,"I ordered Eckhart Tolles' book used, which came to me like new. Would never have known it was used. Price was very fair, and I received item before I expected. I am 100per cent pleased with this transaction. I would also recommend this book for anyone that wants to improve upon their life. Thankyou."
3,Interesting read,"I have gotten about half way thru the book. It is interesting read but, some of it is a bit strange. It really wasn't what I thought it would be. I had planned to follow Oprah and Eckhart on line but, got frustrated with the web cutting out. As fate would have it my computer crashed when I was going to look at another webcast.I guess I am not really into this ego examination process at this time."
1,A 2 HUMP Camel,"If you are a Christian and you are reading this book, SHAME ON YOU!! Consider yourself as having turned from the Gospel of Truth to following a seducing spirit. I have read through the contents of the book and the first chapter; I find it interesting with all the ""Hope"" that I'm sure is promised from being ""enlightened"", at the end, in the final chapter, such hopelessness; ""The New Earth is not a Utopia"". If it is not to be a Utopia, then why believe at all? Everyone who reads this book needs to be ""enlightened"" to this - RELIGION can be defined as what sinful men do for a Holy God, but the Gospel of Jesus Christ is what a Holy God has done for sinful man (this means everyone, even Oprah and Tolle). We can never achieve acceptance by God outside of anything but this: That we receive His Son Jesus Christ as our Savior and God's sacrifice for our sins. Why is this so hard to swallow? How truly Christ said, ""You swallow a camel but strain at a gnat!"" This book is a 2 HUMP camel."
1,Waiting for the revelation!!!,There's been a month and a couple of days since I bought this item and I haven't received it yet. I don't know if it is shipping or any other problem. I will be glad to write a review as soon as I get the book and read it.. I'm looking forward to doing it.
5,Great book!,"It is my practice to highlight or underline phrases in a book that really strike my attention.In this book, I have underlined nearly everything!"
1,Disliked this book immensely,"I was given a copy of this book over a year ago as a gift by someone who was trying to be helpful and supportive. I hated the attitude this writer had about spirituality in general and felt he was talking down to the reader. I could only get through a few chapters before feeling physically ill by the author's spiritual arrogance. The ideas were not challenging to me at all and I felt no connection with the person behind the words. Save your money and see a good therapist before wasting your vaulable time on the planet reading this gibberish. Only you can know and create what your purpose is, and nobody else can tell you what that can be, not even this charlatan. I find it hard to understand how so many can be taken in by the words of a single human being. There are plenty of others who have written better: Ghandi, Mother Teresa, Goethe, Sartre, Wittgenstein, etc. Read the greats, and you'll know of what I speak."
5,Awesome Book,"Tolle is one of those very rare people that can cut to the chase. His message i.e. his personal experience is utterly simple. No mantras, no chants, just be present. What else do you need to remember?"
1,"What a waste of time, this book is for high society people","Rich people should read this book, it's not for the middle class.The author has an excerpt ""become a stone or crystal"", Mr Tolle is an idiotas he tries to get us to fantasize about becoming unreal objects."
4,TMF,The Author does a good job with his easy read format. This is a book for someone to reflect on over and over again. A good tool for a Therapist to recommend to her clients.
5,Spiritual Awakening,"This is one of the best spiritual and enlightening books of our times.Eckhart Tolles ""A New Earth"" describes what it is like to be an ego driven society on the brink of disaster and therefore much change to secure our survival of as a species. But it's more then that, it teaches us how to deal with our painful existence and to be just present in the moment, not looking towards our future our past, just be in the now.It's a wonderful book, that has awakened me to enjoy my life right now!"
5,Exciting,Wonderful book. Gives me hope for the future that there are people this advanced spiritually.
1,Not what I expected.,"I found upon reading the first few chapters, that this is not in keeping with the other metaphysical reading material that I am accustomed to perusing. Since we all have our own pathways, we each follow what resonates with us. I am not in sync with this path. The information iswell written."
1,Dark view of humanity,"This book was reccomended by a relationship counselor - and I can tell you its pretty far out there and was no help. The book begins very flowery and the writing style goes back and forth from listing out numerous examples to illustrate points ...to exotic, descriptive words that are meant to impress.If you can make it past the first few chapters you may find some meaning.The author has a very dark view of humanity in the opening pages and to follow his line of thinking you have to identify with these ideas and be dedicated to completely re-working yourself.This book does not give off positive vibes as you try to get into the first few chapters. I also didn't really identify with the pain body idea that -this is a sentinent organism that lives inside of you an seeks out absolute negativeity -or the idea that a women's pain body begins soon after ""menstruation."" Makes me feel as if we are back in the 50's. I am sorry I feel more evolved than this..."
2,eh?,"Wasn't really for me, but my family is raving about it. They say I don't ""get it"". That's probably true."
5,Superbly written!,"This is one of few books that realistically defines, identifies and fully explains the content and function of the ""ego"". Tolle is well-spoken and able to teach us in a sane and understandable way. He brilliantly defines how and why many of our human behaviors are driven by the ego and helps us see what is happening ""behind the scenes"" of our own conciousness.A very timely book in the current age of awakening. . .I will read it again and recommend it highly to anyone seeking understanding of why we do what we do and how to stay sane in a ""world that has gone mad!"""
3,Too much hype!,"This book was certainly inspirational, and had many good guidelines for living a stress-free, happy life by focusing your mind away from daily monotony and worry. I did feel, however, that there was so much hype by Oprah and online surrounding the content of this book, that I was a little disappointed by it. The begining and ending chapters are the best, while the middle is full of material that just repeats what was already covered in the previous chapters and also goes out on a limb a little too far. Some of Mr. Tolle's points are far-fetched, but overall he has good advice for those looking for peaceful living and spiritual growth."
2,Deja Vu,This book does not awaken anything in me that I haven't already been awake to already. I bought this book because I am a HUGE fan of Oprah and most of her picks are great. This one is just boring. These concepts are better taught by Marianne Williamson and Ernest Homes and A course in Miracles even does a better job than Tolle. I only gave two stars because I feel like being gracious.
3,the new earth,"It is interesting, but not earth shattering like Oprah says, but then she wants to make money off everything she is associated with. The book keeps you thinking. I am enjoying it slowly."
5,Profound and life changing,"This is an incredible book that is causing me to be more aware of and distinguish between, the voice of my ego, and who I really am.Read SLOWLY and with a highlighter pen!"
1,Awful,"The author offers a few good points, but between those points are pages and pages of useless rambling. I could not make it through the whole book."
1,"He who knows, doesn't speak - or write a book about it","The first page of the Tao te Ching says something like ""the tao cannot be explained."" And then, Lao Tzu goes on to write a whole book explaining the Tao, which cannot be explained. That is so FUNNY! I love it. Tolle does a similar thing here - he explains how to awaken to your life's purpose, but then asserts that only you can really know how to do that for your particular journey. So basically he writes a book saying, ""I am going to tell you how to do something that only you can know how to do for yourself."" If there is no ""right way"" or ""wrong way"", then what are we even talking about? Why not just twiddle our thumbs and nod at each other? Hey, I bet that's why monks just sit there and nod at each other. HAHA. That's funny. I made myself laugh. Monks. Nodding. And farting. HAHA Farting monks."
1,The Truth???,"For everyone that has the ""Good News"" of the Gospels written on their heart, I caution you. I feel that this book is the Truth of God's Word presented upside down. Had to rate at least one star zero was not an option.For those of you that do not have the Truth written on their hearts, I urge you to seek it first, so that there will be no path to deceit."
3,fighting the wrong war,"Tolle has a common slant on life on earth today: he's against war, violence and oppression. Mos of all, he opposes the human ego, comparing it to a fatal cancer and blaming it for all our bad acts. It robs us of kindness and selflessness. It drives us to ""win"" every encounter in which we are engaged. His book opens with a lecture on man's warlike nature and shifts attention for the reasoning of warlike persons. Everything they encounter they want to win or overcome. This may be true. I have seen egomaniacs intimidate individuals and crowds into feelings of shame for not wanting to ""win"" more than they do. Sports coaches are good at that. Politicians, too. Egomaniacs always want to have the last word, which is why I write this after I read the book. Later I heard him read the text on audio. He sounds like a mildly puzzled professor waiting for his mom to find his meerschaum pipe while his tea cools in a long Russian crystal glass."
1,Boring,"Too much new age, hippy non-sense for me. I'm all for self improvement but this book was too magical and spiritual."
5,wonder why you think your are nuts?,"A must read for the insight on how to re-direct or turn off that voice in the head that is so unsettling. Read Byron Katie afterwords and get familiar with ""The Work"" to cut through some of the BS your mind generates."
5,eye-opening!,"Like a lot of people, I was exposed to this book via Oprah. Not directly, but due to the fact that so many people started talking about it after she had the author on her show.I am really glad to have read the book. It has an interesting take on a number of things, ""sin"" being the first which really caught my attention. Much different from the Southern Baptist culture that I was raised in. Same for his view of what ""Heaven"" is.You may not agree with everything he says, but I this is a book which will certainly make you think. For me, it made me realize that I wasn't alone and not as crazy as my Southern Baptist relatives think. :) That alone was worth the price.Overall, good thoughts about being ""one with life"" that I think will be beneficial to all people, regardless of religious affiliation."
5,Extraordinary Book IMHO,"Stumbled on this book quite by chance - on (of all places) a financial forum where I'm a regular in a string with members listing their favorite books. A New Earth was the only one I didn't already recognize, so I picked it up from the local library just to see what the fuss was about.It was hard to start, but for me, it is one of the most important books I have ever read, and the most important in about 10 years at least. After 55 years on this earth, I was surprised to learn more about myself and understanding others than I imagined possible, and the learning has only begun. I am a newbie to this sort of topic so I found it a tough read, very different from the mainstream American cultural mindset, but if you're open to it, it is a most enlightening experience. I also watched the Oprah webinars with Tolle which also helped me understand it better. I have since bought my own copy, as I expect to refer to it often. A remarkable book..."
5,A New Earth,"This book was what I expected and more. There are parts of the book that are not easy to digest, but if you persist, it is well worth the read. Eckhart Tolle reaches within the deapth of the inner you. A continuation of the Power of Now this book is powerful, soul searching and awakening. I would recommend this book to anyone."
4,a new earth,"The book is in good condition, it took a week for it to arrive.I think the author 's insight is right on target.I hope more people will read this book, and apply the teaching"
5,EXCELLENT READ!,This is one of the Best self-help books I have ever read. Was so glad to receive it in time for the televised class with Eckhart and Oprah.
5,Wake up and live a little,"This book explained to me how it is possible to go to bed in the world and wake up in heaven. Changes in awareness happen all at once, or so it seems to me, but our understanding of what 'just happened' takes place over years and years. Those years are filled with guilt, regret, joy and pain--they amount to growth. However, that actual growth took place almost instantaneously. Perhaps that time between the occurrence of change and the understanding of that change can be better used than by suffering after the fact. This book promotes and facilitates new awareness as a means of decreasing suffering for the individual and the society he or she inhabits. Great read. I've sent copies to at least five friends. Got it on audio book and have gone back and read the book. I like the audio book with Tolle reading his work to me."
4,Big thumbs up,He's hard to follow.......but knows what he's talking about. Just my opinion....but you asked.What do you mean five more words required?
5,Absorbing Book,Every page is full of substance. Eckhart Tolles' soft-spoken approach helps you filter through all the work. One can discover many principles of Buddhism and Taoism in this book. This is a book some people might want to read one page at a time and just contemplate on it the rest of day.I see from reading the reviews
2,Way over hyped,"I've heard great things about this book, so though I would give it a read. Overall, it's a good read, but I feel the author is stating the obvious and constantly repeating himself. There are only so many ways you can state the same claim and I felt those ways were exhaused in this book. You definitly do not need this book to awaken your life. It will only reiterate what is already obvious to any sensible person. I would NOT recommend this book. The author has not found the purpose and answer to life. In fact, anyone could have written a book like this."
1,don't waste your money or time...,"Was Oprah kidding with this book? I can't even force myself to finish this book. This is a book of a bunch of nothing that goes in circles. I am sure the author would say this is my giant ego speaking (he speaks a lot about our egos) and he's right, my ego and I have wasted enough time."
1,Lame,"I would not recommend this book. The review that said it was ""Buddhism repackaged"" is right. I would recommend reading the Bible instead."
4,Not a novel,"This is not a novel. It is difficult at times to understand what the writer is trying to say, but the further I read the more it begins to make sense. My interest is sharpened as I go."
5,A reminder,"This book is designed to remind you who you really are. Eckhart accomplishes what he alone could not do. He has opened the flood gates of awareness upon those who can understand his words.If you resist the words of this book, you are resisting your own reflection. If you feel that he has cheated or manipulated you in some way, you really don't understand at all.He is simply trying to rouse you from your slumber to take part in this life the way it was meant to be lived.If you cannot stand to look at your own reflection, your life will be hell. If you can accept and embrace what you see, your hell will turn into heaven.He is simply trying to hand you a mirror. It is the most precious gift he can give you."
5,A true game changer...,Simply amazing.. I understood every sentence personally. It revealed a perspective that I had only heard of and never knew myself. It would be so beneficial for anybody who cannot figure out why they're unhappy.
4,What if the whole world were really conscious?,"That would that change everything from the antagonistic way we view others, our neighbors as well as everyone else in the world, and the way we think of ourselves. I give too much energy fighting things that I'm not going to be able to change. The early chapters of this book felt as if they were written especially for me. I read them while on a silent retreat, so I had time to really hear what I needed to hear from Tolle. The latter chapters I found to be less relevant, but nonetheless, this book has given me substantial meat to chew and a new way to see others.Connie Shelley"
5,"The book says ""Yes"" to life, and gives to us the priceless gift of hope","A NEW EARTH continues the important teaching first brought forward in THE POWER OF NOW. Its message is a light that effortlessly dissolves the darkness and confusion peddled by our corporate religions and established psychologies. Much like the works of OSHO, the writing is simple, straightforward, and genuinely healing. The book says ""Yes"" to life, and gives to the reader the priceless gift of hope. Written with courage and clarity, A NEW EARTH is the finest of books. Eckhart's insight into life and mind touches that intuitive part of us that proclaims, ""This is it. This is the truth."""
3,hum!what was that you said,THIS BOOK HAD TO MUCH MEDIA/OPHRA HYPE/WHILE THEIR WERE MEANINGFUL/AND EDUCATIONAL POINTS/HE TAKES ALONG TIME GETTING THERE/I FIND THIS AUTHOR OVERRATED AND A BIT BORING
4,Zen Philosophy Redefined For The Western Culture,"I didn't read his most popular first book, The Power of Now, before I read this one. I really enjoyed his dissection of ""The Ego,"" and its destructive nature to our happiness and our lives. Focusing on just being aware and in the present seems so simply yet in our over-stressed ""tread-mill"" lives, can be challenging. While standing in line at the Rite-Aid, I happened to pick up an Enquirer Magazine, to read that Jim Carey (the actor) was reading this book and viewing the DVD, The Secret, too. I like Tolle's concept of disposing of our ego and focusing on who we are in the present and being content with what is. Good reading. I've mailed a copy off to a close friend and shared it with several other associates. Worthwhile reading if you have an interest in spiritual growth and enlightenment, not to mention being happy with your life as it is now."
1,Concerned,"Instead of returning this book to Amazon, or sharing it with someone else who might glean ""something"" from it, I chose to throw the book away. I can't even remember when I did such a thing before. It's not out of anger or frustration, but a genuine concern regarding the philosphy of this man. As a (striving to be) Christian each and every, I can't in all good conscience support such writings that make reference to Christ as if he is just ""one of the boys"" or equal, or less than Buddha, etc. Please know, fellow readers, the decision to throw this book out was not lightly made. Beware of such worldly wisdom............Sincerely, S.K. Simmons"
2,So-so,"The views stated in the book are no more, no less similar to those of Krishnamurti and Osho, to name a few. You'd be better off reading those individuals."
2,disappointed,I am enjoying the book. Unfortunately about 60 pages of the book are upside down and in the wrong order
5,A New Earth,Everyone needs to read this book. It should be required reading in some high school classes and college classes. The man is brilliant. And humble.
4,Another Eckhart Jewel,"I have read Tolle's ""Power of Now"" multiple times and was anxious to go further with him on his journey to bring peace to the human condition. While I did not enjoy this book quite as much as PON, this is a great read because it continues to add color to the direction Tolle and others are treading. This is great material but it suffers from a fundamental problem: The message cannot be completely communicated with words! These are ideas that transcend what can be written directly. This leaves the communicators with an obvious challenge. Tolle continues to meet this challenge eloquently in ""New Earth"" by pointing us in the general direction of ancient yet fundamental truths about our existence. My greatest hope is that enough of us will lock on to the direction these folks are pointing in so that we can help with the heavy lifting by simply living as the truly ""free beings"" as we are meant to be."
5,Robert Smith,"This book is profound, timely, practical and inspiring. Think of it as a guide to awakening for humanity. Without getting religeous, this book provides a roadmap for those called to seek Truth. If you feel the need to go beyond the surface life, this book is designed as a pointer to ease your way. Excellent."
1,More egocentric drivel from Mr. Tolle,"Oprah fell for this latest nonsense new age babble from Mr. Tolle and made him a wealthy man. If you want to learn about yourself, read 'The Prophet' or anything by Kafka, not Mr. Tolle's mumbo jumbo. For reasons I now forget, I read Mr. Tolle's 'The Power of Now' and had to use all of my present moment energy to get through that one, which was at best a minor attempt at intellectual depth. I decided to give him another chance since, well, if it is in Oprah's bookclub, it must be brilliant. How could a greedy ego-maniac like her be wrong? Bottom line: 'A New Earth' is stupid. Don't waste your time or money. And if you want to learn about flowers, buy a book on Garden Design. Or better yet, read this excellent suspense novel:Drachman's DilemmasYou will gain insight you did not know you had."
5,this book changed my life,"i have read ' the power of now"" and i liked it but i just did not seem to get it. a friend told me about ' a new earth"" and Oprah doing the book for her book club so i bought it. i also took the classes they did. this book opened my eyes to things in a big way. it made all the things i did not understand understandable. it all made sense to me. Tolle talks a lot about Jesus in this book. it made what Jesus said really take on a new light. i recommend this book to everyone. but if you read it and don't get it or don't feel it holds some thing for you.. then as Tolle says in the book you are not ready to be awake. i bought the book for friends.. hoping they will get it. but as it says in the book that may not happen . if you want to read some thing that could make you think differently about your life.. read this book."
3,Deja vu? A re-hash of the Power of Now,"I found more than half of this book a repeat of ""The Power of Now"". Otherwise, a good teaching for those who didn't read the first book. Good advice on recognizing the ego in action. Hopeful teachings on making people aware of their actions, their interconnectedness with others and how our actions affect them - and the well-being of this world."
5,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose,This is excellent- packed with information that sounds familiar so feels like truth. Excellent theory with practical examples- works for all spirtual/religious disciplines.
5,wonderful,"I love the Power of Now but I think A New Earth is even more profound and lucid. I find that this book - like all Eckhart's books, but this one has it even stronger - has an almost uncanny power. Somehow you can feel the wisdom it contains seeping into you as you read and taking you a little closer to realisation. This book gives you a profound understanding of how the ego works, and after reading it you are never quite the same person again. We are amazingly lucky that Eckhart possesses such an acute intellectual mind with an enlightened spiritual state. (The two don't often go together.) I've also been reading books recommended on Eckhart's website, including another stunning book called The Fall by Steve Taylor.The Fall: The Evidence for a Golden Age, 6,000 years of Insanity and the Dawning of a New EraIt goes together very well with A New Earth. The Fall goes very deeply into the origins of the ego and its insanity and compliments Eckhart's profound analysis."
5,Dust off your Bible,"Reading this book gave me a glimpse of what the audience of the sermon of the mount must have ""seen"". It is like hearing the gospel of Jesus for the first time. It is a story we think we know but do not ""really"" know. This wisdom has led me back to the source. I will read the words of the New Testament again with a much deeper understanding of Christ's words. I"
2,Was not enlightened!,"I enjoyed his last book more, The Power of Now. I don't think there was anything new here in his attempt to show us how to awaken our consciousness. I agree with the other reviewer who said he appears to be going around in circles."
3,hmm,"I liked the message of this book, but found it kind of hard to read. I've read other books with a similar message that spoke to me much more clearly. He uses the phrase ""or so to say"" way too much."
4,Enlightening,Eckhart has hit upon an essential topic of our time. His insights into our character as humans help pinpoint the shift needed throughout the whole of humanity. A necessary read for those awakening to the new consciousness which is now upon us.SPUNKY COLLINS
5,A Path to Individual and Collective Knowledge,"Mr. Tolle provides insight into our destructive ego driven lives. After reading his book, I was able to more easily spot my ego based thoughts and smile at them. Mr. Tolle's speaks of who we really are and our connectedness. His discussion of our pain bodies resonates. So many of us are acting from our pain. I have purchased a number of copies and sent them to folks in my immediate circle asking them to pass on copies to folks in their circles. They have reported that they have benefited from their reading and engaged in discussion different aspects of the book. It is really time for us to awaken from our illusions of reality. Thank you, Mr. Tolle.D. Watson"
4,good,"This is a really good book. It wasn't hard to read but it was deep. It made me think. Sometimes I had to reread to ""get it"".Lots to think about."
4,Wow!,"Changing my thought process and my state of mind, and keeping it there (not falling into bad habits) was challenging...but I quickly noticed a difference and noticed more positive things happening around me."
5,a new earth,"Very helpful, it has changed my life. I think anyone would benefit from reading this book."
5,"The Power of ""New!""","When I was 14 years old, I had what is called a ""spontaneous mystical experience,"" which put me in direct contact with the core of my being. I have never forgotten that experience, and what it taught me about who I truly am--that ""my identity,"" as Tolle writes, ""is not the content of my mind, but the awareness in the background.""In The Power of Now, Tolle did a good job of explaining that. But in his new book, A New Earth, I believe he does an extraordinary job of explaining the difference between pure consciousness and thought. No other book I have read explains ""the ego"" in such eloquent detail . . . describing what it is, how it functions, and how it inteferes with our happiness and fulfillment. Thank you, Eckhart, for this truly enlightening read.Steven Lane Taylor, author of Row, Row, Row Your Boat: A Guide for Living Life in the Divine Flow"
1,lies,Jesus was not on the path of enlightenment. He died on your behalf. literaly. compare what this book says about Jesus and find the quotes in the Bible and see for yourself... Tolle is using Jesus' words for his personal gain. how much has he made on this book alone?
5,Ancient Wisdom Brilliantly Adapted for Today,"Tolle brilliantly synthesizes his own experience with insights from major religions as well as from Buddhism (a spiritual lifesyle but not a religion) to give us, in one book, the guidance and inspiration we need to live more peacefully and productively. A New Earth makes deep and ancient truths available to us in a way we can understand and use to improve our own lives right now. And because he and Oprah are offering free online classes, based on the book, through www.oprah.com/, this book may literally change the world. People who live Tolle's wisdom will not only lead more satisfying lives but will also be better friends, better family and community members, better employees and bosses. Imagine how different the world will be if we are our best selves every day!"
1,A joke?,"Is this book a joke? How can so many people like this? Joel Osteen is so much better. This book basically states ""become a robot with no feelings or identity, and you will be happy too!"""
4,A New Earth,The book was well written and informative it has given me a new lease on life. I am now utilizing the recommendations written in the book.
2,Incomplete,"The advertisements on this book were interesting. I haven't gotten very far. Eckhart Tolle's writings are enlightening. However, his oral presentation is totally void of modulation which makes it difficult to stay with him for long periods. In light of this it will take some time before I can give a complete review."
3,The condition of the book,"The book itself was awesome to read, I start to look at things, people from totally new perspective.And about the condition of the book - it was poorly cut on edges, it looked like it was eaten by a mouse! I had to took it to a special store to cut the edges again because it is impossible to give such a book as a gift! Not really happy about that."
4,Great book,"When I recieved this book I was looking for something to make that ""shift"" in conscientiousness, I found it in this one!"
1,fake plastic Buddhism,"If you have ever heard and caught the meaning of ""fake plastic trees"" by Radiohead, you get the point. It looks just like the real thing, feels just like the real thing....but its fake plastic. This book is plastic buddhism for spoiled westerners who are not about to follow the noble path, which contrary to modern portrail is a faith of piety. They look real.....but they are not and in this case if you are waiting for some fruit to bloom, you are just as likely to get it off the trees!"
3,Great Message but Boring Repetitive Read,"Although I loved the message of this book, Eckhart Tolle's writing style is a bit boring. It took me over a month to read this and by the last chapter I couldn't wait to finish it and be done with it.I have read many books on the same subject and have found that other authors have a better way of grabbing the reader's attention. Tolle did have me highlighting certain points and gave me a few ""aha"" moments. However, his over use of quotes and repeating the same message about how the ego is to blame for all our problems throughout the book, made it seem repetitive and poorly written. You basically can get the same message from any book on enlightenment.I will try a stab at his other book ""A Power of Now"" in hopes that it's not too know-it-all and more to the level of his readers."
5,great book,"Wonderfully well written and insightful book about one's self discovery and the power within. Offers an explanantion ot the meaning of life even tho I wasn't even looking, it was very interesting and uplifting."
2,Hardto follow,Inhad heard of Tolle from a number of friends. Found his book to be tedious yet the message worthy of the effort.
5,A New Earth by Eckart Tolle,This book is a must read for people who are ready to change their lives fo the better.
1,Tolle is an @$$!,"I hate, hate, hate that I wasted even just a few hours of my life reading this book! He's an elitist who talks in circles and doesn't really share anything of value. You're better off looking elsewhere for enlightenment!"
3,Same again,In this book Ekhart expands greatly his previous books with a great increase in words. Yet his message is the same. I enjoyed it to begin with until it became repetitive and concluded with the re incarnation theory.i.e. the soul finding another body after death. He sets himself up by making statements like this without any evidence Or his statement the purpose of life is to awaken. So many words to try to get across something simple. So much promised at the start of the book like all the enlightenment books. Another disappointment in the end but better than his previous attempts.
2,Don't waste your time,"Although the premise of this book is noteworthy; to improve ones self, it is wordy, hard to navigate, and to be honest with you there were few ""Aha"" moments in the book.I honestly bought it because Oprah recommended it, a momentary lapse of judgment!I am glad that I read it, but I honestly cannot recommend it unless you want to spend your time reading and rereading to get your arms around what could have been said much easier.Hope this helps you!"
2,The FINAL Transformation...,"i'd like to see one of these spiritual types be bold enough to come out with a book with that title. but it won't ever happen because essentially, most of these books are void of true nourishment (whatever that means). Otherwise, there would be one book to end all of these books. Instead we get countless clones of clones while spiritual types gobble them up like some kind of heroin fix. Last year it was THE SECRET now this, and then what. Tolle said it all in a few lines in THE POWER OF NOW. If he meant what he said in that book, why this book? Sadly, these authors are as addicted as their readers. Now that's Oneness!"
3,Life changing?,"I don't know how to change my way of thinking and processing information. I don't know how anyone can really awaken to their life's purpose either...unless friends, family, co-workers, lovers and enemies slap them in the face and set out a plan in their face. Does it take a tragedy to awaken an awareness to one's true being? Are you what your thoughts are? Can you change how to think and feel about life, events, bigotries? Will it take hypnosis for one to change and recognize life purposes? Does it take more than one or two books by the same author to convince a person that ideas and thinking has been wrong all the years of living? Try reading A New Earth and see if you can be awakened to your life's purpose.I'm the author of the book KISSING FREUD, an exciting psycho comedy/drama; and the book DUBROVNIK, a thrilling spy/drama set in Dubrovnik, Croatia. Both are available here at amazon.com/books. Enjoy."
1,context.,"one ought not take the Word of God from its context. The Word will provide promises, not speculation. Give to God what is His, and then you will understand ""beingness."""
1,Warning,"the message of the antichrist wrapped up in a self help bookwatch/google Bishop george bloomer's "" do you really know who Jesus is?""this video will enlighten you on the trash written in this book."
3,Good Concepts,"This book had a lot of good concepts. My favorite being the pain-body.I did find this book hard to follow at times because the author jumps around so much.Some of these concepts have been told before, but overall an interesting read."
3,Dull,"I felt that the tone was tedious. It read like a boring lecture. I agree with his ideas. I am sympathetic to the notion and philosophy of non-dualism. But his presentation of the subject was boring. If you are interested in some of the ideas presented in this book, (No Self/Ego, non-dualistic) then I recommend that you check out The Book by Alan Watts. It's got the same basic philosophy behind it, but it's presented in a in a fun, exuberant manner that eclipses the dry tone of Tolle."
1,dangerous,A dangerous book and a cultish following lead by Oprah herself. Beware as they lead you away from the truth and into a lie that has nothing what so ever to do with Jesus Christ. Oprah and her teachings are NOT CHRISTIAN!!!!
1,Audio CD of A new earth,I have not recieved the audio CD of this book yet. Did it get lost in the mail?? Please ck and let me know. reota edwards
1,ECKHART TOLLE IS A PHONEY FROM THE WORD GO!,"THIS BOOK IS A SUPREME SHAM!WRITTEN BY THE CURRENTLY IN-VOGUE ... ""PIDED-PIPER"" OF THE U.S. ... SHEEP HERD!HE LAUGHS ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK THAT AMERICA IS FILLED WITH SO MANY FADIST SHEEP WHO FALL FOR HIS MALARKY!A GREAT WAY TO WASTE YOUR TIME AND STILL END UP AN UNENLIGHTEN-SHEEP.A FOOL AND HIS MONEY IS SOON PARTED!WHAT IS THAT CLICHE'... OH YES... THE TRUTH HURTS..."
1,Secret Demon,"Just remember. If you wake up in the middle of the night with intense pain and get caught up in a vortex like Mr. Tolle did, and then a little voice says ""resist nothing"" which is what happened to Mr. Tolle:PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASEdo not 'accept it', do not 'allow it', do not 'let go'.Resist it with everything you have because it's a demon entity trying to take root in your body!Mr. Tolle says that humanity is advancing into a new level of consciousness. What he wants is for humanity to become mindless zombies stuck in the present moment, allowing external circumstance to control it's destiny.Fight injustice, fight terror, fight immorality, fight the mind control and misinformation that the media, government, and religion perpetrate on us.Seek the truth vigilantly without just 'accepting your present' and 'letting go' of your past and future."
1,Nonsense,This was truly one of the most horrible books I have ever made the mistake of having paid to read. Oprah has really gone off the deep end with this pick. What was she thinking??? Pure Hogwash. Mr. Tolle is a nutcase. Don't waste your money.
1,Waste of time and money,"If you are a beginner in your spiritual path, this book might be ok but for most this will be a big waste of time. He spends the first half of the book talking about ego (could have done it in a few pages) and the second half he rewrote most of his points from the Power of Now. He gave Oprah a small % and the they are both taking advantage of the poor reader. My sugestion is buy Infinite Self 33 steps and the Power of Now and you will be very happy with both."
1,Getting in line to be obtuse....,"THE NEW EARTH BUSINESS IS ONE OF A LONG LINE OF OBTUSE IDEAS, BORROWING FROM THE MAJOR RELIGIONS WHERE HANDY; USING SOME NEW WORDS TO SET THEIR IDEAS APART FROM THE NEXT THING COMING DOWN THE LINE. MOST OF IT IS COMMON SENSE, BUT CLOTHED IN NEW WORDS, LIKE PAIN BODY. HOW ABOUT JUST SAYING SIN? THAT'S WHAT HUMANS DO TO EACH OTHER, AND TO THEMSELVES == GIVING IT A NEW TITLE DOESN'T CHANGE THE EFFECT OR THE GUILT. THAT'S ANOTHER WORD WHICH HAS BEEN LEFT BEHIND IN THE DUST OF NEW WAYS TO MAKE MONEY BY PUBLISHING BOOKS WITH NEW VOCABULARIES. THEY ARE NOT OFFENSIVE; THEY ARE SAD."
1,misleading Lies,"This book is so decieving,it twists the truth of the Bible into what the author wants them to mean.Totally wrong...stay away from this misleading book, it is really buddhist Christianity and that is not possible to truly do!"
1,A New Earth,Self help; not as impressed as the advertising (including Ophra) led me to believe I would be.
5,This book is a phenomenon!,"This is by far the best book I have ever read. I have never had so many AHA moments as I've had with this book. Give yourself the gift of sight to your true self. If you are ready to go deep inside yourself, this the book will get you there. Enjoy the ride!"
2,Difficult to absorb,"I find Mr. Tolle to be brilliant and yet extremely difficult to follow without rereading passages or pages several times. He is extremely cerebral or intellectual in his discussions at times and I understand why Oprah is attempting to assist his with getting his message out as what he has to say definitely has merit. However, I found that SHIFT: 12 Keys to Shift Your LifeSHIFT: 12 Keys to Shift Your Lifewas much more accessible and practical for me to use. It was easier to understand the concepts and gave me incredible tools that I could use in the moment to make a profound difference in my life... and continue to on a daily basis. I don't understand why this book is as prominent as it is and that SHIFT is a sleeper."
3,Wipe out The Self to Reach Togetherness?,"I love attempts towards world peace, but to attack fundamental, life-furthering attributes of the individual is not the way to get there.Ego is often mistaken as sociopathological. As I differentiate, proper ego is to value oneself, versus a Social Ego, which is intended to impress others. Seeking to impress as a primary driver is certainly a neurotic pursuit; it's a dependency.Nature offers us many patterns to assure consistent, independent moral action. Awareness of them is all that's needed; and if we're using them and benefiting, we'll be proud of our every action as we deserve to be.I say STOP trying to wipe out the individual. No matter how beautiful the words flow, its method is slaughter. It wasn't the answer in Midieval times, and it isn't the answer now."
3,Average,Movie was as well to be expected being that the movie is an older version. Bought the movie as a gift for a family member.
5,Neglected masterpiece,"With the possible exceptions of Soul Station and A Slice Of The Top, this is Mobley at his best. It is hard to believe it has been so neglected, but then, so has Hank himself. Have worn out my LP of this recording so it's great to see it on CD, especially when lesser Mobley albums have been re-released time after time. The music here is not typical Mobley hard bop. It is gentle, reflective, but not without its edge and represents his composition skills at their peak. Truly, a neglected masterpiece."
1,Only for completists,"The appeal of Thinking Of Home eludes me. Simply put, Hank sounds exceptionally burned out and broken throughout the entire recording. There are so many wonderful Mobley albums spanning the 50s and 60s that novices would do far, far better by starting elsewhere."
4,Very Good Book,"This is a very helpful resource. I withheld one star just because I dont think they chose the most useful verbs. I have been disappointed several times at not finding the verb I need. Oh well. But I LOVE the addition of idioms and common phrases at the bottom of each page. I have learned a lot from them. Also, the quizes and study helps at the back are great."
3,adequate,"While I waited longer than expected for the book to arrive, the seller was solicitous and kind about the mix-up. I would probably use this seller again. The book arrived in good condition and I am finding it quite helpful."
2,Not the best,I don't understand why 501 French Verbs is so popular in the States. One reason I can think of is that the other verb tables are not so widely available. It is expensive. I have my students order Collin-Gem French Verb Tables or Barron's French Verb in group on Amazon.com. 501 is so big and heavy that it is inconvenient to bring to class. It is 50% more expensive than the other two verb tables. You will never need 501 verbs-- you just need 100-200 and a good index. There are not that many irregular verbs in French anyway. 501 is a paperback too... Barron's table has a nice plastic cover... Check out others before you buy this one.
5,It's a must for anyone studying a language.,I feel that this book is extremely helpful in any language. I am multi lingual and I often turn to this book for help. Anyone who is seriously studying a foreign language should have a verb book.
5,A must for any student of French...,"Unlike the Bescherelle (the other ""must"" verb book I own), this book is excellent for the beginning French student simply because it's, well, simple. Each verb is conjugated separately (whereas the Besch. has verb ""groups""), and although one is limited with the choice of verbs, it's a great guide for quick reference- when you don't want to think about if the verb is regular or irregular and guess at the endings. It's all right there. Sooner or later, you're gonna need a Bescherelle, but this is a wonderful starter kit."
5,The Best!,"I never would have made it through 5 yearsof French classes without this book. If you'restudying French in school, this book willmake your life ten times easier!"
5,GREAT!,Just what you need to find just about any pertinent French verb. All the tenses are given. Very thorough - I used in for school for years and never had to buy an update.
2,Very Cute.....But What A Disappointment !!!,"I purchased this book knowing that my daughter would have loads of fun with the cute magnets. She loves Bob the Builder and it would be great for road trips! I even saw ""6 Magnetized Pages"" on the cover & counted them, but alas, I miscounted because a section had stuck together -- The inside cover & last page ARE NOT MAGNETIZED, YET ARE HALF OF A PICTURE!!! It's crazy, and very frustrating to the age group this is designed for. It would have been so easy to magnetize the front & back covers as well. I am returning this copy & will buy again if Golden Books corrects their defect!!!!!!!"
2,great price - expensive shipping - tricky wall hardware,"bought these for the great price - however the shipping cost me more than the hooks themselves. quality is fine. however the hardware requires that you predrill the hole for the plastic screw sleeve - both tries to install the screw, the plastic sleeve disappeared into the wall. i've now got no sleeves and thus cannot install the hooks. standard drywall screws would be better...."
4,Dance & House music with a soul touch,"The Italian group's first album: Catherinenever sung, but Loletta Holloway did and never got payed. Anyway, the lyricsare very strong . The samples and sounds are often Italo House. But there isalso a wonderful Earth , Wind & Fire cover of ""Fantasy"". Other hits are""Everybody, everybody"" and ""I don't know anybody else"". It's a nice, danceyalbum, but more bubble gum music than anything else.Black Box are still working - with a new singer though."
4,I can't believe I lost my copy!,"I was in Europe in '89-'90 when ""Ride One Time"" came out, and it was EVERYWHERE. When I came back to America, ""Everybody Everybody"" was just picking up steam. Martha Wash provided amazing vocals on all tracks, except ""Ride On Time""(Loletta Holloway sample). It's a great dance cd that never fails to bring me back."
2,stealing From a Deep Place,"They say it's easy to write half a book and unfortunately Brian did just this, but with two different books which he put together as one. The first half is a pretty good bicycle tour book but somewhat hard to keep up with his progress. However, he seemed to lose his track and drifted off into politics, women and party life in a former communist country which left me less than breathless. I suppose if you want to visit former Soviet enclaves, it's OK but I bought it to read about bicycle touring.Jim Foreman"
5,Finally I've got it :),"I'm so happy that I got this cap. I'm from Hungary and it's really tuff to get here a Red sox cap, and I don't know since when I wanted one and it's great. I wasn't sure about the size, but thanks to the other reviews I got the large one and its perfect :)"
2,She hates it!,"My friend had one of these that she absolutely adored. But my dog ate it. I bought her a new one, this one, from here. She absolutely hates it! She never wears it. She says it doesn't fit right. The brim is too long. She misses her old hat. But it's the thought that counts. :("
1,sizes run very small - simply doesn't fit,"Beware - the largest size of this cap doesn't fit my head. Granted, my head is large compared to most, but other caps of the same size fit fine."
4,Like and dislike,"I like that this hat is dark blue, darker than the photo makes it seem, and I like darker hats. I don't like that it runs a tad large.Thanks, I appreciate it. Have a wonderful day"
5,good hat,everytime i have ordered from amazon my packed comes so fast love the service good prices this hat is for my father in law he wll love it all american hat go sox!!!
4,Great hat,"Its a Great hat, Love the way it looks. Only issue I have with is it seems to be sized small. I ordered a large which they have listed as 7 1/4, but the hat deffinitely fits snug. If my head wasnt pretty much shaved right now dont think it would fit."
5,RedSox everyday,I once was a Brooklyn Dodgers fan; then they disappeared. I became a beloved Red Sox fan and enjoy everyday of it.
5,Great Cap,I Received my cap in a timely manner. The packaged arrived in perfect condition. Iam a huge Boston Red Sox fan but unfortunately I also have a large head and the adjustable caps just weren't sitting or fitting my head correctly. The fitted cap is the best for me. If you are considering purchasing one please don't hesitate. I am very pleased with all aspects of my purchase.
5,Eye Opening,"The Soviet Experiment gives an insight into the heart of the Soviet Union unlike any other work on the subject that I've ever encountered. The book covers the major players in the revolutions and their attitudes and manipulations toward the formation of the perfect state. The writing style is factual and enjoyable as it moves back and forth between time periods in order to explain in more detail the topic at hand. I recommend this book for anyone who is interested in understanding what the Soviet Union was, how it became, and how it came to an end."
1,NOT ILLUMINATED,"I ordered this because my 80 year old dad wanted an eye chart to do eye exercises. I figured an ""illuminated"" one would be best. This is just the plastic face that slides in to a light box that you must already have! Needless to say..I don't have one! I was very disappointed."
2,bad translation of italian editor,none only this compilation is constantly outdated (the collection showed are in fact the one showed at the basel fair 2 years before) but the lay out and design is desesperatly poor of creativity and boring article about the companies full of typos. Obviously somebody is trying to make money on the back of the fascinating watch world.
5,Excellent bible to prestigous watches,"Great pictures and details of watch movements and materials, usually with prices. A must for any collector or even someone looking for that one of a kind piece that may suit their needs. Only drawbacks - Some of the newer, what I consider high end brands are not included and the extra leaflet that comes with it shows no prices. More or less useless (leaflet only) unless you are rich and don't care about cost. I don't credit any of these problems to the publisher/author. The industry is fast paced and I am impressed they have as much info as they have. I Call it ""My bible towatches"" (with minor exceptions"
3,It is a CD to listen when you are lonely.,"I've tried to listen to it 3 times per month since 1996 when I got it. For me, the tracks below are recommended to listen to : 6 years 6 nights, 21st century, When Bogart talks to you. It is a ""Dietered"" CD."
4,The Gun Digest Book of Trap and Skeet Shooting,"A fine guide to the breaking of ""clay"" targets in flight. It covers the three major clay bird games, to include sporting clays, skeet and trap. It can serve as a primer for the nimrod and a fine refresher for the more advanced shooter when their scores begin to fall off.Lots of action photos and a decent explanation of the origins of the differing games, the ammunition used, the different gun sizes and the various accesories."
3,great album,"very dissapointed of delivery ,i had ordered other items standered speed this ex this came last not saying sellers fault but very frustrating record in good condition thou"
2,"whole wide world, is the only good track","I loved the song ""WHOLE WIDE WORLD"" when it was released in the UK in 1989, but the album was not released in the uk, well i don't think it was.Anyway ""WHOLE WIDE WORLD"" does not seem to belong on this album, the rest of the cd is quite strange, wish i'd just stuck to the CD SINGLE."
5,AMAZING!,"This series is spectacular, not only is the artwork amazing, but the storyline and characters are gripping too! And as to the allegations of this being about a girl being groped by her schoolmates, there is absoloutely no sexual content in there AT ALL. Guys don't be put off, there's plenty of humour and action, I'm not a fan of really girly books either but I looooved this. This series really stands apart from the others, it's worth buying even just for the artwork alone. Even if you just buy a cheap used copy to give it a go, this is a definate must. I guarantee you'll be hooked!"
4,She isn't just a girl in a swimsuit,"When I first started reading Crescent Moon, I was hooked. I loved the art, especially of Mahiru in her underwater world. It's so beautiful. And in response to another reviewer. I didn't realise that it was even supposed to be a Shoujo or Bishounen manga. Maybe if you'd finished the book before reviewing it, you would also have noticed that there is more to the plot than ""a young girl being groped by all her schoolmates"".All in all it's worth buying."
2,I don't get this book...,"This manga is pretty confusing, it is hard to tell why the detectives are after the ""Luner Race"" and why they need Mahiru to retrive the stone. Second of the confusing part is that it is pretty hard to tell whom is the vampire, bat, warewolf, and etc. Third is that why Mahiru (the descenence of the princess) had such horrible luck toward herself, but have such extremely good luck whenever she touched some other people, however, her classmates only see her a good luck charm and monster at the same time...The story began by the folk tale of the princess promise a demon that she'll marry him after she's grow up. However, she forgot the promise and marry someone else, the demon tried to steal the bride but got slay...Will the ""Luner Race"" able to ask Mahiru to retrive the stone they've lost? Will Mahiru betrayed them once again? Can she figured out the folk song? Can the detectives detroyed the ""Luner Race""???"
2,The Fantasy Crusher....STRIKES AGAIN! (and I'm still a girl),"Well...here I am, writing negative reviews about the books I hate...what fun, eh? I figure that people like me will enjoy being saved from books I hate...or something like that! Anyways, sorry to the people who liked this book! This book really didn't keep me focused on it. I kept on getting distracted. I also didn't like the main character. In real life, I would probably kick her. Because...um, BEcause...uh...ANYWAY, the story is also kind of garbled. Maybe the plot thickens in the next one...? I don't know. I don't happen to care, either.It's also not very entertaining. No jokes. No stupid stuff. Just all of this nightcreature-hoopla. Oh yeah...HOOPLA!HOOPLA!HOOOOOOPLA! Okay...I'm done. I gave this book a two instead of a one because the story, at least, has SOMETHING going for it. It may be very small, but it's there. I think...But I'm not gonna waste MY money on it!"
2,Wasn't impressed.,"Usually a Shonen Ai and Yaoi fan I decided to try a different genre and I wasn't impressed with this Shoujo Title. A young girl being gropped by all her school mates, talking about her period and always in a swimsuit? Not to my liking. I put it down after reading 20 or so pages. No real Bishonen, seriously try Yaoi, this Shoujo genre has nothing to offer to what I've seen."
2,Expected a lot more,"For the price and reputation of this product, I expected a spa experience which I did not get. Only two of the five settings really give sufficient coverage and pressure, but even then it's not that great.Also I bought this from Buy Wholesale Cheap who is a seller on Amazon. Wish I'd read the negative reviews on this seller's profile beforehand, because they are horribly rude just as others had posted. All in all it was not worth doing business with them and I won't be buying from them again."
4,"Happy, happy",I am loving this shower head. I like the different water flow patterns and the adjustable angle of the head was a great surprise.
5,A magical world in comics,"This is a charming collection of early 20th century comics by Lionel Feininger. His colorful drawings are enrapturing: he has a great sense of design and ability to create characters. The Kinder Kids escape their elders and embark on fantastical adventures, Wee Willie Winkie sees the world through the imaginitive eyes of a child. These comics are very funny and magical."
2,Two songs that Bowie never should have re-recorded,"The b-sides on this single are horrible. When Bowie wrote them in the 60's it was different, but these songs sound immature and don't show an ounce of talent that he has shown for so many years since. I really don't get why he chose to re-record them, considering all the old material that he could've used instead (how about some rereleases of songs from 'David Bowie'? That would've been great). Still, for a historical Bowie fan or simply any Bowiefile this is not one to miss, as I have it and I'm glad I do for my collection, but as far as listening I've tried to get into these songs a number of times but always to no avail."
2,Cheap,This table is okay. Very cheaply made. But it does the job of holding a lamp and books. I use it in my son's bedroom.
4,Good product for the money.,"This is the second one of these tables I have purchased. One is in black.Both went together easily and are quite sturdy. The painted surfaces are not the highest in quality with some imperfections in the wood materials. Nothing substantial enough to warrant returning or a harsh complaint. For the price paid, it is what I expected.The hardware is adequate and the table should hold up to use rather well.Overall I have been satisfied with the two tables.I have put together a very large variety of furniture from all different manufacturers, I even make furniture on occassion. Always remember you generally get what you pay for...and always shop around to compare prices and shipping charges."
3,Ya get what ya pay for,"Didn't expect much for the price and I wasn't dissapointed there. Quality is sub-par as is finish - one unit was packaged before the whitewash (I definately would not call it paint) was dry so the packing material was stuck to the wood in several areas. But all in all when cleaned up and assembeled it is fine for the beach house, mother in-laws apartment."
2,Returned this today!,"Table is a lovely soft white! Had to return table today as there was an issue assembling it. The 2 sides could not be attached to table top! Either the ""large screws"" were too large or the holes drilled were too small. If forced the wood would split. A shame because this would have worked beautifully as a printer table."
2,Looks good but not so nice,This table comes with some assembly required. Some meaning a lot of assembly required. The drawer sticks and it is very cheap. Not the best table.
4,Nice little Table,Bought this table to go with my daughters new bed.It is a little larger than I realized but it fits okay. I liked that the corners are rounded so she cant get hurt as easily and it's a sturdy table. I like that it's solid wood but it could use another coat of paint it is a bit see through but that is easy enough to do myself. I really didnt have any of the problems with the holes not lining up that most other people did and the the peg that goes to stop the drawer from coming out acutally goes on the inside of the drawer not the outside as stated in another review. The directions are just pictures and I found them easy to follow. It only took me about 30 minutes to put together and thats because my daughter was trying to help me.I would recommend this table and would buy it again if I ever need another bedside table.
4,Nice white end table,"I got this as a small table for a lamp and books. It took me a good 45 minutes to assemble. It wasn't too hard, just time consuming. It does look very nice and seems sturdy for it's size. It's nothing fancy but I think it's well worth the price as an end table or night stand. I may get another one for my room."
1,Cheaply made,I would not recommend this table. The screw holes didn't match up so we weren't even able to assemble it. The quality was very poor in general. We ended up returning it.
1,Not easy to assemble because of holes not lined up,"Very frustrating situation to begin to assemble this product only to find that the holes for the top of the table did not line up with the ones to connect the legs! The hex ""screw driver"" was of little use as it did not work after a few turns. I had purchased two of these for guest quarters, and returned both of them. I will not purchase from this company again. b.f."
3,Off-Kilter,"The finished product is pretty good quality for such an inexpensive piece. However, it was getting to that point that was terrible. The thing should have been easy to put together. BUT, most of the screw holes were off, some by as much as a half inch. Even with a POWER DRILL, the knob on the drawer would not fully tighten; the screw would just not go in all the way. I ordered 1-day shipping which was great, but if it weren't for the return shipping hassle I probably would have sent it back. It wasn't worth all the trouble of having to drill new holes. It serves its purpose."
3,Not great,"This was difficult to put together, none of the holes lined up properly, and it was all with a hex wrench! I needed an affordable small nightstand for our guest room and I got this cheap thing. Not good, but it works there is no way I am taking it back apart! The white paint is rubbing off the knob on the drawer... do like the size and shape of this, it is just not a quality piece of furniture... :("
3,Get what you pay for,"This is a pretty inexpensive table. I bought it because I needed a small nightstand in my daughter's nursery and didn't want to invest a ton because I don't know what kind of furniture we will want when she is ready for a twin bed. It's serving it's purpose of holding a baby monitor and a place to put a bottle or book when I'm rocking her. It's assemble yourself, really cheap (especially the drawer) and ours isn't 100% sway-proof. But I paid $30 and its not just one of those round tables you put a skirt on."
3,End Table/Night Stand,I received this nightstand yesterday that I purchased for my daughter and really wasnt happy with the way it looked. It was smaller than I thought it would be and it has a white wash finish instead of a shiny finish and not sturdy at all on carpet. Like they say you get what you pay for. I will be purchasing a different nightstand at a later date.
2,Ankle High Stockings,"These wouldh ave been a great purchase if they were made for people who have skinny legs. They were also way too long for me. I am 5'3"" and weigh about 135 lbs and could not keep these on my feet. I thought they would be perfect for wearing with slacks, but unfortunately, they are not one-size-fits-all as advertised."
5,Love the book!,"I really like the book, this is our first pet and the book provides a lot of information that is very helpfull ! We love huskies !"
5,GREAT GUIDE,"I love this book, I keep it in my bag and read it on my way to and from work. I find myself going back to it all the time and using it as a reference. With a Husky you can never know what they are doing next. This book helps keep a eye open on what they are thinking or plan on doing.GREAT USER GUIDE."
3,Good place to start,I thought this book was a good place to start your search if you think you may want to share your life with a siberian husky. It gives a good clear overview of what is involved in living with the Siberian. It also has a lot of fluff and should be used as a stepping stone for more through research into the breed. Especially if you plan on raising Sibs or racing them.
2,call it 'Labradors for Dummies' and still get the same book!,"I bought this book cause i need a good review of what to expect from my new siberian husky. the book has a nice history and a few 'story' related to huskies but this is as far as it get from beting related to huskies. most if not all of the advices are general and can be applied to any kind of dog. it has nice tips, stupid remarks (like - one of the best 10 things about having a siberian husky? it makes you to be neat - cause otherwise the dog we eat everything. EVERY dog will eat anything!).so - my advice - if you're searching for a specific siberian husky book - try another one. it's a waste of money. sorry."
1,Cut and Paste version,"Waste of money, The author doesn't even have a husky. How can a person who doen't own a husky can write a book about Husky. Most of the article is a cut and paste version on how to know and understand your dog in general.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK. IT IS REALLY FOR DUMMIES...."
5,I liked it,the book picks up where the Setite novel ended.All together an interesting look at how the Ravanos clan do things.lots of familiar faces if you've read the previous installments.might be a bit hard to follow if you have no idea what came before but well written and enjoyable to read.
2,Penn is good but language is a barrier,"Penn had some excellent things to say and he said them well three hundred years ago. What he had to say is still excellent but, unfortunately, the old language makes the reading a chore. Since a more complete version is available in contemporary language, I recommend Eric Taylor's edition, (0836192052) published by Herald Press. Mr Taylor's historical introduction and endnotes are an added bonus for the inquiring mind."
5,Transorts me to Italy with every note,"I first heard this music in 1987 and have been looking for it ever since. I stumbled upon it again, if you could believe it, in EPCOT (Orlando, FL) back in October of 1997. The group was performng in the Italian Pavilion and I stood, dumbfounded, listening to this beautiful music. They were selling their series of CD's after the concert, and not knowing the exact title, I bought two, crossing my fingers that when I arrived back in CT to listen it would be the one I spent ten years looking for. Low and behold I guessed right, and have been listening to it every day since. The entire series is just as good, but this one will always hold a special place in my heart."
1,USB 2.0 - NOT!!!,"This hub is advertised as supporting USB 2.0 (480 Mbps), but I've tried it with four different computers (all with USB 2.0) and each one recognizes this hub as USB 1.1 (12 Mbps) only."
2,not extactly as advertise,"It says that it is USB 2.0, but when I plugged in my ipod, I got a message saying that it is recommended to hook my ipod to a 2.0 (faster) USB, which means that it is not a 2.0, It is a bit slow getting anything to show up. Despite that it does work it all you care about is having a hub to hook up everything and are not worried about it speed. It is compatible with Mac's and Windows."
2,Light Show!,"Nice to have seven ports, but each is lighted a different color, that's ok..sort of, but there's a center light that changes color and twinkles and is VERY distracting. I could do without the light show."
1,Useless,"This one taught me a lesson about going cheap on something that's under $20 to start with. Even when it does connect a given peripheral, there's no guarantee that it will connect it next time the system is rebooted. These are low-power-draw peripherals - card reader, Zen MP3 player, MagicJack phone adapter, etc. Next time I'll spend $20 for something that works. This one goes into the pit."
1,Cute little gadget. Where's the AC power adapter?,"All I got in the package was the device itself. No advertised power supply, no cable, and no instructions. It does look good on a shelf, but how does it work, and what does one do with it? (Be careful now)"
2,Hmmm. Wish I had known it was a Disco Show,"The picture shown on Amazon.com is accurate. LOTS of pretty, pretty (CONSTANTLY FLASHING) lights. If I had known this when I was ordering it, I wouldn't have ordered it. Very distracting for a work environment. I now have it shoved at the back of my desk, but the flashing is still obvious.So far everything works okay."
2,Sabrent USB hub disappointing,"the seller did a great job; he got them to me quickly. However, on both mini-hubs, I had to plug in devices several times, sometimes plugging them into different ports to get them to work. One I set up at one of my user's desks so I don't know if she is having problems. but on my machine, I've had to unplug/replug several times. And I'm only using simple devices like keyboard, mouse and USB flash drives. my printers (3) are plugged into the onboard ports. One machine has XP Pro (32-bit) and the other has Vista 32-bit. Plus, I don't mind the fact that each port is lit (and with a different color), but the flashing light that changes color is rather annoying (it is constantly flashing!) and it seems to serve no purpose at all. I usually don't have any problems with Sabrent products which is why I am so surprised at this item."
2,USB Disco!..,"Woo, have I been tossed back to the 1970s or what!? This device would be just great if it were not for the inability to shut-off the lights. The lights are very bright and if you sometimes work at night the lights could pose a problem.On another note, when attached to either a Windows XP or Windows Vista/Windows 7 machine the device registers something less than High-speed USB as advertised. When used with the supplied power adapter or not the device will not show up as a High-speed 2.0 device. The transfer rates of this device have always been better than those of the earlier USB 1.x but never up to par as a true High-speed USB device.However, I would recommend this product to anyone whose needs aren't as demanding and wouldn't mind the Disco light effects.Thanks for your time."
1,Doesnt Work,Never worked for me. Doesnt even charges my phone. So pathetic piece of junk. I am throwing it in junk today...Should have read the comments :(
4,"Great product, love the colors","The product arrived in a timely fashion, I was very pleased with it and would buy from this seller again."
1,I'm 3 for 3 failed with this one.,"I'm on my third one of these and still haven't got one that works properly. Either XP tells me it's a USB 1.1 or it fails when certain devices are plugged into it. If you're lucky, it's a cheap hub if the USB devices you have will work. Otherwise you'll regret it.The light show is really pretty, if you want it for the lights, but they are useless for the hub. They are not for in-use or activity."
2,Light Show !,"It has an LED for each port that stay on all the time, they ARE NOT port status/activity LEDs like other hubs. It has a multi-color LED flashing all the time.The power adapter is only 1 Amps and is not enough power for a 2.5"" external HDD. I tried with a 2Amp supply and the drive works with the hub.I could have bought two strings of LED Christmas lights for what I paid this light show."
1,Worst product ever purchased,"It might have worked the first day I plugged it in, I'm not really sure. Since then I've noticed that my computer will not boot if this hub is plugged in, and devices plugged into it do not work. The picture doesn't show the true atrocity that is this device's light show. There is no reason at all to have so many flashing LEDs. It annoys you to death, and that's before you realize it's not even doing its job. I buy a lot from Amazon, and this is the first thing to leave me horribly disappointed."
3,"not for 17"" laptop","This is a great bag for the price, but a 17"" laptop does not fit in the padded compartment. It will fit in the bag loose, unprotected."
4,film noir drama,"this dvd is not a perfect print but is good for sound and it as a slight color image in parts but hardly worth the worry. i have always like to watch any movie with george raft in, he has away of putting it over with a very good style and a nice actor at that its good for the price and well worth buying and keep in your collection, I do give this movie a 4 star rating and well worth bying just for the cast"
1,should remove it from Amazon Prime,"I love Ava Gardner, so I'm always willing to check out any of her movies I haven't watched. Sadly, this streaming version is of such inferior quality that it is simply unwatchable. I actually have no idea if it's a good movie or not because I tuned out after less than 5 minutes."
5,Very Valuable Book for the Oscar Enthusiast!,"There is a lot of information about wild Oscars, which is very cool, but the best part of the book is about keeping Oscars in an aquarium. The pictures are beautiful and plentiful. I especially enjoyed the section on Oscar Toys."
1,"I returned because of damage. I have requested Replacement Bat shipped to Same New Lennox, IL Address. Where is the NEW BAT?","Returned because Bat was damaged. I have equested a New Bat, be mailed to the same New Lenox, Illinois Mailing Address. Where is the Replacement Bat? The Season is winding down, Please ship the replacement Bat. Thank You!!John W. Bizzak(319)892-3071"
4,"Entertaining, get lost at sea reading this","I'm actually writing this review for multiple readers, as well as myself. I read this book last summer, loved it, her writing style is fantastic, descriptive. The recipes are fun as well. I shared this book with 3 others (females) who read this cover-to-cover and all agree its a great read. I just noticed it is out of print - must have been fairly recent as I was able to order a second copy a month ago (for one of the other readers who wanted her own copy)"
3,"Good, but not what I expected....","Well, I thought this movie was pretty good. I was pleasingly surprised. Although, I am a HUGE Mark-Paul Gosselaar fan, and expected to see much moree of him. He was in the movie for the last half hour or so, and not even that much. Considering he's on the cover of the box, I expected to see more of him."
1,terrible goody goody script and film,"This film is such a terrible film it looks like a bad pax/hallmark tv movie. I am ahuge Soleil Moon Frye fan and seen many of her films and she does a descent job with such abad script that stars tv's melrose place/savannah vixen Jamie Lurner who honestly does a bad acting job and is unbelievable in this film. If you want to see abeetter acting job of lurner rent Confessions of a sorority girl were she co stars with alyssa milano.Mark-paul gosselaar who is on the all around the cover of the box is only in the last portion of the film,eventhough i am not ahuge fan of him he does adescent job.It goes to show you dont judge abook by its cover. I thaught about given it two stars,but that will be to generous of me and god knows I will be lying."
5,Yum!,"A must for anyone who loves good food. I bought my copy about 20 years ago in my bachelor days, and still refer to it regularly. If you can learn the techniques in this book and in ""From Julia Child's Kitchen,"" you'll be in the 99th percentile of home cooks. Add a couple of Pierre Franey's 60-Minute Gourmet or Cuisine Rapide volumes, and you and yours will eat well for life."
5,This Book Taught Me How to Cook,"Long before most cookbooks were teaching the ""whys"" of cooking, Beard came up with an entertaining and instructive book filled with explicit instructions and detailed explanations. The recipes are great and still hold up. A fine book for the beginning cook."
4,Great variety of workouts for those with a little more Yoga experience,"This DVD is very well done, with a nice variety of workouts. I enjoyed doing something different every day.However, this is NOT for beginners! I would highly recommend Yee's beginner DVD, or one that teaches you all the poses and gets you acquainted with the practice of breathing. I would consider myself a beginner, though I have done a few different DVDs and some classes. I was thankful for the background I had, but still felt I needed to know more poses and be in a little better shape to do some of the workouts on this DVD.If you are at an intermediate level and want some great workouts to do at home every day, this would be perfect. I will definitely be using this DVD after a little more experience!"
2,Unsatisfying and confusing,"I didn't like the speed with which they moved through the poses in some of the segments, especially considering this video has been recommended for beginners. I'm not a beginner, and it was still difficult to keep up with the flow of the poses. If you're looking for a video where poses are held for any length of time, or one that's easy to follow along with, this isn't the one. I also found some of the verbal instructions confusing, and had to stop and rewind the video several times to figure out what they were talking about. Lastly, I didn't appreciate the use of English translations in full substitution for the original Sanskrit names of the yoga poses. I realize not everyone knows the Sanskrit names for the poses, but it's also true that there's no standardization of the English names, either. As a result, I never really knew which pose they were referring to, and this added to my confusion."
4,"Some good, some bad","I only liked a few of the workouts on this DVD. I certainly prefer those with Rodney Yee alone. No offense to the woman who is working with him, but I just prefer his style of instruction. The first daily program really isn't much of a workout, it's just a review of positions so I look at this DVD as having, realistically, four good workouts to it."
4,"What it's got is OK, but it needs more","The instructional is good, really good. But there's only one ""morning"" and one ""evening"" session. Kind of lacking and repetitive. Would have been better to have several sessions of each to showcase more of what beginners can do."
2,another waste of money,I am not sure why anyone is giving this easy dvd anything more than 2 stars. The yoga section is very good and the 10 minute cardio core sculpt. that's it. The pilates ones are so so easy and quite frankly a joke. either i'm mega advanced or the pilates sections are made for true true beginners....overall I wasted my money yet again. I haven't found a better ab workout than Cindy Whitmarsh or exhale core fusion dvds........
3,not a Rodney Yee DVD,disappointed that DVD only had one workout that was by Rodney Yee. When the discription said by Rodney Yee I assumed the whole DVD was by him. The workouts are not all yoga which is what I thought I was buying.
5,The Gruffalo,My three kids love the Gruffalo. I highly recommend it for children aged between 2-7. Great illustrations too!
5,One Of The Best!,"I read this book to my kindergarten class and they LOVE it! The children act it out, sequence the story through pictures, journal about it and talk about it for months it is one of their favorites and mine too! I love reading it because they get so excited and it is so much fun to read over and over!"
5,Best book for reading aloud!,"This is such a great book, with excellent rhymes and rhythm to the text. It is an absolute favorite of both my husband and me to read to our 9-month-old, and we expect to be reading it with him for many, many years. (It's probably too advanced for him, but the bright, colorful pictures and the rhythm of the text keep him interested.) I'm so disappointed that it's become special order only - we wanted to get it as a gift for several nieces - it is really a great book and so much better than what you can find at a typical bookstore. (It might still be available from Amazon.co.uk if you can't get it here.)"
5,Destined to be a classic,"It's surprising to me that this book is not better known here in the US; it's the quintessential picture book, and won several awards in Britain. Compared to most of the insipid picture books out there today (i.e., the ones where you think to yourself, I COULD HAVE WRITTEN THIS), this book really sparkles. It's fun to read aloud (i.e., it rhymes), has nice pictures (albeit not Caldecott material), an interesting and clever twist, and a moral: brains can beat brawn. And unlike some of the fine picture books that appeal to me, as a parent, this one passes the most important test: it's beloved by my toddler too. It's a constant choice for a bedtime story. If there were a Caldecott for picture book text as well as illustrations (and there really ought to be!), this book would win hands down. If you're looking for a great picture book (and one your child will remember into adulthood as a favorite), look no further."
5,"Impishly good humoured, great rhyme and matching illustrations","Hugely enjoyable by both adult and children - a great one to read and laugh about. The illustrations always have something new in them to see and the rhymes are easily learned by the children because they are so funny and with great rhythm.""A mouse took a stroll in the deep, dark Wood..."" along the way he meets a fox, a snake and an owl. Because the mouse is clever he convinces them that he is going to meet a Gruffalo, of which the other animals have never heard of - but once they hear a Gruffalo's favourite food is respecitvely Roasted Fox, Scramble Snake and Owl Icecream - they aren't interested in eating the mouse. But then Mouse meets up with a real live GrufflOH! Mouse keeps his cool and even manages to fool him.Glorious good fun from the team which bought you Room on the Broom and A Squash and a Squeeze - highly recommended reading!"
4,Perfect Mix of Rhyme and Story,Here is a good choice for a read-aloud. This flows off the tounge and it is as much fun for the reader as it is for the listener.Trust me on this one....it's a good choice for K-3.
3,A bit of a dilemma?,"My husband and I found the book very cute, nicely illustrated, and of course you can't beat the title. No wonder there are no bad reviews posted. It took our 4-yr old daughter to point out the obvious: the mouse lies to everyone to protect himself. Which mommy and daddy have worked hard to convince her is NOT a good thing to do. Oops! I suspect we'll have the same issue with many of the world's folk tales..."
5,Scrambled Snake,"I first read about the Gruffalo in Roger Ebert's online column, and then found the web site, where my great nephew enjoyed the songs and games. We watched the movie version on the Internet, and then I ordered the book. So we came to this point in the classic twenty-first century way. He's three and this is his favorite book right now. It's scary in a silly way, so not too scary. The illustrations are fun to look at and the story is a pleasure to read over and over and over... so this book is highly recommended by multiple generations."
4,the grufallo,"This is a fabulous story for children, I am an elementary music teacher and singer-songwriter myself and have found that children in kindergarten through third grade love to hear this tale and the other stories in this series and ask to hear them over and over. Donaldson's wonderful characters and their different personalities come across through the accompanying CDs. They are excellent, I even belong to the fan club.The GruffaloSuzi More"
5,a very cute story,"This book is so fun! My 5 year old and 3 year old have both memorized it because we have read it so many times. The rhythm makes it fun to read, and the story is really cute. We have given it away as gifts as well because we enjoy it so much. It's a family favorite."
5,A terrific book for little ones--AND their parents,"We first encountered this book while visiting relatives, and ordered it from the UK via Amazon immediately upon our return home. My 3 year old son chooses his stories every night, and he ALWAYS includes this one. I'm not sure he fully understands the wit of the little mouse who outwits his predators, even one he thought was imaginary, but I appreciate a book that holds up for parents even when they must read it nightly. My boy laughs out loud every time the Gruffalo turns up. A terrific find."
3,"cute plot, but not a favorite","Not particularly well written, but the plot is cute. My son is too young to choose the stories, so I don't know if older kids might like the book. Personally, it isn't one of my top choices for story time."
3,Unhappy,"I am still waiting for the Gruffalo and I had to buy from a bookshop, because I had promised my grand daughter she would have it for her Birthday. So, please, I would like to be reimbursed for the whole amount charged to my account. Thank you. SylviaI woould lke to let you know that I have received the Gruffalo todAY (2 weeks late)"
5,Possibly our best book,"All I will say is get this book. My nearly 3 1/2 year old got it for Christmas and loves it. We have an absurd number of books in our house (many of them I would say are very, very good), and my husband and I (and my daughter) think this may be the best and most clever. We enjoy all of Julia Donaldson's books. My husband's first favorite was ""Room on the Broom"" at Halloween. Now he loves ""The Gruffalo"" as well as Donaldson's ""Charlie Cook's Favorite Book"". ""Stickman"" was pretty cute for the Christmas season as well. Daughter loves them all. Great author."
4,Lovin' The Gruffalo for all ages,"I'm an 8th grade language arts teacher. I just used this book to teach irony, situational and dramatic. The product description does a good job describing the plot. It's about a quick thinking mouse who makes up The Gruffalo to keep others from ""inviting"" him for lunch, tea, etc. In turn, the mouse is shocked to learn there really is a Gruffalo and uses the other animals to make the Gruffalo believe he is a scary creature himself. My 8th graders loved it, and the simple displays of irony made it a good example for my students, especially my ESL students. My own boys (5 and 6) love it too. It spends time going to and from school with me, and everyone likes to read it again and again."
5,Terrific book even for toddlers.,"My kids love this book as much as they love the dvd. The rhymes are great, the illustrations are great and the story is wonderful. Big hit with my three year old and 21-month-old."
5,One of the favorite toddler books,This is a great book for kids. My two year old daughter loves the rhymes and the artwork. Definitely recommend this!
4,Not as preachy as you'd think,"You see ""women of Faith"" and think, oh no...all church doctrine and nothing more. Wrong here! This is a good book, plain & simple. I enjoyed reading about the friends' lives: joys, trials, and opportunities for growth. Peggy Benson looks so much like my own Mother, I just had to fall in love her right away. Her girlfriends too...you'll love them. Keep an open mind for the rest of the text. Reading what these women wrote down will make you laugh, cry, and celebrate life. Enjoy!"
4,Really amusing!,"With this film, first you have to get over the fact that one aspect of it is unrealistic. I won't go into what that is, as I don't wish to ruin the movie for you. If you are a big Debra Winger fan, this is a ""buy"" right off the bat, no need to read any more. Two brothers, one of them her husband, are fighting over her in a most extreme fashion. I promise you have never seen a fight like it. Jim Varney (Ernest Goes To Camp) and M. Emmett Walsh have great cameos in this film, as does a singing fire brigade. While this will never be on the AFI top 100 list, if you like an offbeat comedy, you will probably like this, and you will likely want to watch it again now and then. As I stated in the first line, though, if you are a person who insists on every minute of a film being completely credible scientifically, then you may want to bypass it, as a bit of a leap of faith is required regarding one point."
4,Our Generation Bathtub and Access.,"This was a nice set and a really good price! The other brand was more than double this price! My daughter loves it! Obviously this might not be durable enough for a younger child, but just fine for the age of girls that will probably be into 18 inch dolls!"
4,HBO in the 80's!!!!,"This was a spooky, gory and weird series that truly pushed the limits of HBO at the time. Kind of like The Outer Limits mixed with Tales From The Crypt, it features a hitchiker that kind of ""introduces"" a new story every episode. Many famous faces and directors got a start on this series. HBO used to run this show at about 11:00 at night to make sure all the kids were asleep!"
5,Welcome back Hitchhiker,"Wow, there's a great collection of talent there! With episodes featuring award-winning actors such as Helen Hunt and Joe Pantoliano, and participation from fan-favorite director Paul Verhoeven, this surely is a must-have for any DVD collectorKoch Canada will release The Complete First Season on DVD April 20th. This 3 disc set will contain 26 episodes The show must have aired differently in Canada because what Koch considers the first season is actually the first 3 seasons according to the episode guide at EPGuides.com. It's not all good news though; the people at Koch Canada said that they don't own the Canadian rights to the second Canadian season so they're unable to release those episodes."
2,Disappointing!,I like offbeat as long as it's understandable...I did not find these episodes to be so. Not up to usual HBO standards.
3,OK Horror Series From The Reagan Era,"I believe this show debuted in 1983 on HBO and started out very strong. As the 1980's dragged to a close, the shows got weaker and weaker with every season. Most of the shows in this collection are from the mid to late 1980's so you won't actually see the best shows the series produced. I really hoped the shows from the first couple of seasons would have been included because they were much better. Needless to say, these are pretty standard horror stories that seasoned genre fans will not find too interesting. The show featured many up-and-coming stars who were building their careers during the 1980's and many of them went on to much bigger and better things. Some of them are Helen Hunt, Kirstie Alley, Willem Defoe, and Peter Coyote. I liked the show much better back then than I do now but then I was only a teenager and did not know the horror plot conventions like I know now. I mainly bought this for nostalgic reasons."
5,another great album,The first Tea Party album I bought was Transmission. I thought it was amazing. I was let down by Edges(maybe to much hype). Splender was awsome though. This album is by far their best. Touch and(to sound like I'm jumping on the band wagon)Heaven Comming Down are my favorite songs. Great Big Lie is also an incredible song. I think musically this album is their best. The sound isn't as mechanical as Transmission and not as deppressing as Splender. This album really is a blend of their other stuff. Martin's vocals are probably at their best (powerful yet in some great pain-and still keeps the album happier than their others). Lyrically there is nothing wrong with this album(I like how bazzar the lyrics are).
5,Extra Track?,"A great Cd by great band... nothing I can say that the other reviews dont...But dont buy this version! The ""extra track"" (13-church bells) is part of the regular versions of this album. *There is nothing special about this version* Buy the album, but chose a cheaper version."
4,Avoid the import!,"Don't get me wrong, this is a great album. But avoid the ""Extra Tracks Import"". The extra track (singular) is a hidden track: ""Clock Noise"". It's 60 seconds of a grandfather clock ringing, nothing more. No music, no lyrics. Definitely not worth a few extra dollars."
2,Triptych cliche ballad album plagued with synth,"Triptych begins with the energetic feel that dominated Edges of Twilight. However, even this is unoriginal, having kind of an STP feel. Quickly however, the tracks begin to slow and melow into less and less guitar, and more synth and piano. The lyrics and vocals that are strong and full in the previous albums are cliche and flimsy. The sound of the second half of the album is like a bad Queensryche album. It almost seems as if the Tea Party was attempting a more mainstream sound. If this is the case, they failed miserably."
5,excellent music,The best of your albums. I have all CD's The Tea Party and Triptych is fantastic. Jose De La Paz Perez.
5,Great Progress,The Tea Party is still being a very great band!!!All the songs are very good on this album.Congratulations!!!
3,Good stuff ... relatively speaking ... but not thier best.,"Sure it's good, but you can't go around giving EVERYTHING 4 or 5 stars because then you leave no room to differentiate the good stuff from the great stuff or the great stuff from the phenomenal stuff? This is not Tea Party's best. Although it is good compared to most music on the charts at any given time it just doesn't reflect what this band is really made of. Some melodic acoustic tunes highlight this one for me."
5,Best Cd Of The Year!!!!!!,"What an incredible CD. They have so many different sounds and noises in their songs, it's amazing. I heard the song ""Heaven Coming Down"" and I totaly fell in love with the song. The lyrics are so powerful. I had to get the CD right away. ""The Messenger"" is a wonderful song. Out of all my friends, I think I'm the only 13 year old that likes their music!"
3,Okay,"I bought this despite there being no reviews. It's okay. It is educational and real life pictures, both of which I wanted. However it's on thinnish card stock (thick paper?) and you have to cut it out yourself. I'm probably not the norm but I print out and laminate my own flashcards and I'm already thinking of improving these (laminate, rounded edges, change a pic or two just because I can) or making my own altogether. I would say they are great if you don't do all that and you just want something educational. But for me, for $12, if I hadn't opened them I'd send them back. No offense to the company, that's just my experience."
5,A Jazz Gem!,"I have enjoyed this LP for many years now. It was recorded in 1958and these three GREAT musicians are no longer with us: the virtuoistic VICTOR FELDMAN/Piano & Vibes, the rock solid bassist SCOTT LAFARO and the impeccable STAN LEVY on drums. This is much more than a casual listen and is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
3,"Never Fear, Feldman is Here !","This is a light little CD that fans of Bill Evans or Dave Brubeck should enjoy. The tracks here are all cheerful and bouncy--good early morning jazz. Feldman has a nice touch on vibes and piano and is ably supported by bassist Scott LaFaro. LaFaro also played bass on Ornette Coleman's incomprehensible, if groundbreaking album, Free Jazz. LaFaro died at the tragically young age of 25, in an automobile accident in Flint, New York just days recording some classic sessions with Bill Evans at the Village Vanguard.Victor Feldman is also the pianist/arranger on the Miles Davis album, Seven Steps to Heaven.The Arrival is no earth shattering classic, but it is a good piece of fun."
3,Eye opener,"Although Black Pioneers, The Untold Story, was written with young readers in mind, even those of us who are not so young can benefit from this work. I am afraid that most white folks are pretty ignorant of American history regarding African-American people. This is a sad thing because their history, like the rest of the American story, is important when attempting to get the big picture of the country's early days. Regardless of a person's color, history remains precious. This book by Katz provides an opportunity to appreciate the many struggles black folks had in those days, struggles which seem to continue even to this day. It was amazing to learn of the many measures instituted to limit the rights of other human beings and because of this there is a heavy burden of shame hanging over our history. We can't go back but we can learn from the past and seek to improve things in the future. This work is a welcome addition to American history shelves."
1,Trash and money waste,"I would agree with the other review of this title, but a 2-star rating a too high for this book. It lacks anything that is not covered in documentation, and it is a very rare case when documentation is really better than this trash. I had to write a short program doing specific and simple speech recognition task and ordered this book. To say that I was disappointed is to say nothing. I still had to address documentation and found it much better. Moreover, the book is out of date. SAPI 5.1 was flourishing when this title was issued, and the title discusses SAPI 4.0 Besides, it is impossible to get ant actual skills and learn how to develop speech apps from this book.It is not very understandable why there is no good guide for speech programming using VB, it would be a bestseller."
3,It's Just like the Original Robotech Series But Different,"An acction filled tale about the origin of the SDF-1. You will join Rick Hunter, Lisa Hayes, and all the old crew on their quest to confront the Robotech masters but along the way there will be many exiting and thrilling surprises such as the introduction of the Invid and their robot hordes known as the Organics. If you are a fan of the original Robotech becauses of the mecha you will be exited to know that the SDF-3 is eqiped with a whole new line of Robotech weaponry that will make your mouth water. Such as the Logans and the formidable Cyclones, there is even two upgradeds of the original Veritech known as the Alpha and Beta. They can Combine together to make a nearly invivcible mecha combo. All together Robotech II: The Sentinals will keep even the most loyal original Robotech fan on the edge of their seat."
3,Lower than my expecations,"The book is not the ""A complete Solution Guide to Any Textbook"" that it promises to be. It has plenty of problems, but it tends to be targeting novices in probability. MGF's, Stratified sampling, joint distributions are not dully covered. It includes a Chapter on Markov Chains and Martingales. Although explanation is adequate the deapth of the coverage is inadequate."
5,Probability,This problem solving guide is comprehensive and easily understood. It is a must for any high school or college course in probability. Definitely a must for raising your grades.
3,A good resource for the non-math minded,"I had Bennett as an instructor and used this book throughout the course sequence. I found it to be a helpful resource for teachers who were unfamiliar or ""rusty"" with mathematics. However, if you are a math-minded person looking for more ideas, this book will not help you develop your potential. It is a good place to start thinking about ways to teach and learn mathematics, but not a great collection of information on the whole."
2,Unclear,"This book is not clearly written. Many terms are used incorrectly or in a very questionable manner. The answers in the back of the book for all odd-numbered ""homework"" problems and all test questions is very helpful and convenient. If I were chosing a textbook, it would not be this."
1,This book made me want to drop out of grad school!,"Maybe it's the teacher, perhaps it's the book. But this is one of the most difficult classes I've had in my life. All I feel like doing is pulling out my hair. This book is so unclear. If you're trying to learn math, this isn't the book for you. If you want to be confused, I highly recommend it."
4,Classic work in the field,"Whitney is the prototype for Sanskrit grammars in English. I suspect the author had in mind Allen and Greenough's Latin grammar or H.W. Smythe's Greek grammar when designing the numeric scheme for each point, theme, and paradigm. It is a very useful system of notation for referencing from other works.I can't honestly see going through this lesson by lesson with most students who are not dedicated to long term research in the field and want to begin reading Sanskrit without learning every arcane morphological exception. This book serves as an indispensible reference work by including Vedic forms as well as accentation in the paradigms, which I would imagine is more authoritative than Coulson's simple rules. The book is long and comprehensive, and like Smythe and Greenough, has gained the respect of being ""the"" authoritative source. It is a wonderful book for learning troublesome concepts correctly and more fully than several of the shorter grammars treat them."
4,Whitney Sanskrit Grammar,"I like the introductory sections and discussion of differences in classical and Vedic Sanskrit. Still it moves quickly into more detail than can be absorbed with casual study. It is a good reference text -- easier to find things than some of the other grammatical texts -- and it answers some basic questions, like the history of the word spacing in modern texts. But still engages in the vocabulary of advanced grammar without defining the terms -- for example, desiderative, aorist, etc."
3,A book of westeners view,"I found this book interesting because I already have an exposure to Sanskrit. This book was written in 1875 (no error, it is 1875) and was meant to help western scholars. It is still interesting to know the views of the 19th centuary scholar. Anyhow, if you are totally new to learning Sanskit (the language of Brahman, GOD), please start with a modern book. The type-set is hard to understand (it is a photo-copy of the 19th century print) and the English language used is not meant for novice-learners. Regards."
1,"A Sanskrit Gammar, by W.D.Whitney","This edition of Whitney's classic grammar is deficient. Scanned from a copy at the Cornell University Library, either the copy used was incomplete or the scanning process was faulty, as pages are missing both from the table of contents at the front and the general index at the rear of the book. This is fatal for a reference grammar. How is one supposed to find what one is looking for? This edition should not be on the market: it needs to be corrected by adding the missing pages before it is again presented to the public. Instead, buy the edition sold by Nataraj Books in Springfield Virginia on Amazon Marketplace, in which no pages are missing from either the table of contents or the general index, in which the pages are sewn rather than glued, as they are in the Cornell edition, which is hard cover instead of paperback, as is the Cornell edition, and which, finally, costs $8 less than the defective Cornell edition."
5,Buy this one first!,"Of all the books that I have read (a lot) since I got back into riding, this is the one that was most worth the money. The explanations of horse behavior, the reasons and what the response of the human should be are written in such a special way that isn't clinical or condescending to the reader. The beautiful photos are an added bonus to an already worthwhile book."
2,Reliability,"I bought this mixer on December 8th, 2006.It's a sturdy hand mixer with sufficient power for most jobs.A little heavy for a hand mixer.The internal cord storage sometime jams preventing pulling out the cord.It stops working today (a month or so less than five years) in midstream during a not-so-strenuous job (whipping butter and cream cheese for frosting). The gear probably breaks such that the motor is running but the attachements do not spin."
2,There is no low speed!,"We just turned our red Dualit mixer on for the first time. The mixer is designed with 5 speed settings. The very first speed - the ""blend"" setting - sent our mix spewing across the kitchen. Racy is indeed a correct term. Either our product is defective or the engineers have never made a cake and don't understand a slow start-up. Sadly, we're packaging and returning this mixer, and then washing the ingredients off the cabinets."
3,Stripped gears on thick dough,"I bought this in Aug 2006 and used it until Oct 2008 making cookies and and general kitchen mixing. Used once or twice per week. Great mixer, until I tried it on some extra thick cookie dough and stripped or broke the drive mechanism. I would not rate it as professional quality. I'll probably get the same model as a replacement just to get the retractable cord."
5,Best Hand Mixer Ever!,I bought this mixer for my Mom who has been baking for over 60 years. She is in her late 80's She wanted a mixer that would be strong enough for her cookie dough recipes but also one that had a stir speed. She said this is truly the best hand mixer she has ever had. And she's had a lot. It is powerful and also very smooth. She loves the color too. I think I'll order one for me.
5,Power,"Don't waste your time with weak machines. Pay the extra for the real deal. Over the course of 5 years, the extra cost is next to nothing."
1,Big Disappointment!,"This shelter is difficult to put up and too weak too hold up a solar shower bag. There is no ventilation at the top. True, the tarp is sturdy, but it's meaningless when the frame is so weak and relies on guy ropes with weak little stakes. Also, it doesn't even come with a bag to hold it. Once you open the box, it becomes a big hassle to transport. The only reason that I gave it a star is because it was inexpensive so at least I won't mind using it for parts. As it usually turns out with outdoor supplies, you get what you pay for."
1,Not as expected,"Maybe I was expecting too much, but I would not recommend this item.1) Does not put up with high wind -- maybe again I was expecting too much.2) Difficult to setup.3) No ventilation, clear roof means it gets really hot on the inside4) Clear roof ripped probably on the first use5) Pole system is not user friendly.6) Does not come with a carry bag.I probably used this item only once or twice. It's difficult to setup by yourself. I camp in the desert a lot, and high winds are always expected. Instead of staking the guy ropes into the ground, I used sandbags to hold it up. Since then, it has fallen over and the poles have bent. I recommend the shelters with the fiberglass (flexible) poles, as they flex in the wind, but do not break. Several friends have the flexible shelters, and I have never seen them broken due to the wind."
1,Crushed on the Pot!,It wasn't up 10 minutes when a 10 mile per hr. wind bent the tips on top of the poles & the whole thing collapsed. The poles are not adaquate to support this design. The zippered tent itself is nice if only they had a way to keep it up!
1,Not worth the money,"This is basically a piece of junk. It's hard to set up. The poles come apart when trying to set up. The frame is flimsy and there is no place to easily hang a solar shower. Trying to hang it from the aluminum poles doesn't work. Without the guide ropes, the shower really isn't free standing. Buy something else for a shower tent."
3,Outdoor privacy shower,"This item works with carefulness. Made some changes for our needs and works well for shower and privacy room. Not intended for high winds, needs shelter area or blockage to keep room upright."
3,Cheaply made,"I received this items (as well as others) in a very timely manner and was in good condition.For the use that it was designed, the privacy curtain is very cheaply made. The poles will not stick together. I had to tape them together to get them to stay both in the assembly process as well as well fully assembled. The stakes will not withstand a very heavy breeze. You will have to purchase a better quality tent-stakes to insure the curtain will remain erect.With that having been said, it serves my purpose nicely. I am using it to make a privacy area inside my pop-up camper that can be raised and lower when needed. Using this curtain to meet my needs enables me to store it flat against the roof and out of the way.Just be care if you are planning on using it out of doors.....You may want to consider something a bit better"
2,TO HARD to set up.,"It was a an Idea to bring a privacy shelter for festivals but this thing did not really have an easy place to attach the solar shower. And was too stuff in it to stay in very long on a hot Day, next time I will look for one with screen windows"
5,enchating movie,enchanting arab atmosphere in Tunis. The awakening of senses in an arab teenager is he excuse for depicting the arab society in the '70ies or '80ies.Not to be missed
3,Interesting to watch.,I watched the whole film. The end of the film was unbeliveable. Something must has been lost in the translation or maybe the film maker just didn't have the personnel and resources nesscessary. It is a very different world he shows us and the film is interesting for that reason.
4,Cute Movie!!,"It's a great foreign film to watch at home. It suprised me with the subtle humor regarding sexual discoveries among the main character as he is going through puberty during his adolescent years. The writing of the film (basing myself from the available subtitles) was simplistic, sometimes corny, but the expressions conveyed enough to carry the movie through...The movie is slow-paced and quite of bit of pensive, no-dialogue, moments that could have been filled with some dialogue, e.g. the movie could have a stream-of-conscious approach to know the thoughts of the character, or to compliment his vivid stares of curiosity into women's breasts and vaginas in the many bathhouse scenes.It's a fun movie to watch on a rainy day...I liked it."
1,not a big deal,"Don't buy this movie expecting anything great.The majority of the movie is watching the kid walk in the streets talking to his friends.Then when they finally do show the supposedly ""good scenes"", the women cover themselves with pots or towels!! I don't know what is so GROUND BREAKING about this movie.It's no big deal."
1,A Great Dissapointment,"I loved the movie and the music. I read the previous reviews and purchased at great expense this CD.With apologies to the previous reviewers, I can't belive that we listened to the same CD. Keeping in mind that I am a huge fan, the sound quality on this CD is a great dissapointment. If had bought the CD in a sale bin for $5.00, it would be OK. I expect poor recordings and sound quality. Every now and then you can get lucky. The sound quality of this CD is so bad that my wife walked into the room while I was playing the soundtrack (first time ever) and asked ""what is that horrible shrill.""The previous reviewer did however lead me to the Candoli Brothers, which is the reason I like the music in Bell, Book, and Candle to begin with. So, for that reason, I am truely greatful. I have bought the Candoli Brothers' CD ""Jazz Horizons"". It is a beautiful gem. Buy that CD instead. I did not have $39.00 (plus shipping) to waste.Thanks for reading."
3,Not the music one might expect . . .,"If you're expecting a jazz flavored soundtrack, this is not the album for you. Although it has pleasant moments, the Candoli Brothers are not used to their full potential and that is disappointing but it does have some sentimental value."
3,Be warned,"I suppose it depends what you're expecting. I felt a little deceived having read 'It's a Jungle Up There', not that it's Lowman's fault. The packaging, press and quotes suggested it might be something more, say along the lines of E O Wilson. But this is not an original look at man's relationship to the world. It's more of a cheerleading exercise for the mixture of motherhood and biology. It's filled with enthusiasm for nature, but also with personal asides and exlamation marks. (""Happy Anniversary Michael!""). At the risk of sounding like a real grinch, the book is unforgivably padded by pages written by her two sons. All of these essays, of which there are many, read like college applications. It's a thin book, aimed perhaps at a younger generation. People looking for meatier stuff should keep on looking."
5,Great book,Craig himself thinks this is his best book. I think it's a fascinating journey through very difficult terrain.In response to one reviewer who claimed Craig was wrong about Lorentz I would like to quote from a Wiki on the Lorentz Ether Theory:Because of the same mathematical formalism it is not possible to distinguish between LET[Lorentz Ether Theory] and SR by experiment.Which is all Craig was saying.
2,Reason for only 2 stars...It was hard going,"My review for two stars is only because it was extremely hard going for me, as I have no mathematical or scientific background. But I think that for those who love these subjects it would be an excellent book. I for one struggled with it. Although I did find some interesting points. I didn't feel that I came away with any more knowledge from reading it, and my theory is that even if I come away with at least 10% more knowledge then it was a good book to read.I have heard William Craig Lane debate, and he was succint in his technique, so I thought that this book would be like that, but for me it just wasn't.But for all those who enjoy a book with graphs and equations you will love it.For me though it was really hard going, and never really understood where he was coming from or indeed his conclusion. Oh well..."
3,Great source for references,"This is a well referenced book and gives much information. However, don't expect to find answers. I'm not a philosopher so qualify my comments accordingly. In my opinion the author sometimes uses uses terms loosely and even inappropriately to reach his conclusions. My disagreement with him made it a very stimulating book to read and helped clarify my own thoughts."
4,WONDERFUL CD!!!,"Michael Ball is still one of the BEST male musical theatre singers around right now. Most of the songs on this CD have been heard before, as he's done some on other CD's or T.V. specials. Still... it's nice to have them all compiled. ANTHONY WARLOW sings half the songs on this CD better, but it's hard to compare the two. They are two very different and talented singers. Purchase the CD and enjoy..."
5,Michael Ball brings Boadway to you in one CD,"After being introduced to Michael Ball on the 10 Anniversary of Les Miz, I found that he was a very popluar singer in the UK. I think that Michael Crawford sings some of the songs better than Michael Ball, but you have room for both and Ron Raines, too.This is a great CD by a wonderful singer, especially if you like Broadway. It is an interesting collection in which he sings songs from shows that he was in and songs from shows that he was not in. He even sings some songs that are usually sung by a woman. The only thing I would like better if he sang more songs and the CD notes told a little more about each song. I find listening to music like this very soothing even though it is exciting. I hope you like it, too."
2,It is a comprehensive but biased book,"Although it gives a good account about Russian politics and society, Sakwa is a fierce anti-communist and the book is completely written from this perspective."
2,guilty pleasure,"The films are high camp. However, they are too depraved for children, but not explicit enough for adults. While I enjoy these movies despite myself, I wish they had been more adult by actually showing us more of Kekko Kamen and something of the female students. Instead, we get blinding flashes of light when the naughty bits are shown, or the head scarf covering some things up."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR $$$$$$$$$$$$$$,I BOUGHT 4 COPYS OF THIS CAUSE EACH COPY THEY SENT ME NEW & USED ONLY ONE DISC OUT OF THE COLLECTION WORKING THRE REST FROZE OR SKIPED DON'T WASTE YOUR $$$$$$$$$$$$ YOU'LL BE SENDING IT BACKI GIVE IT ZERO STARS BUT IT WOULDNT TAKE THAT LOW OF REVIEW
1,HORRIBLE!,"As wonderfully funny and silly as the Anime version of Kekko Kamen is, is how pathetic this live action is. All the humor of the original has been replaced by UNFUNNY gags and situations. No Nazi punishment teacher, no highschool students, actually nothing of the original. This is tame and pathetic in every way, not even mentioning the 2 dollar budget and poor video quality that even compared to the worst film at Troma would find unwatchable."
4,"The Original ""Gator Tail""","I had never heard of tenor saxophonist Willis ""Gator Tail"" Jackson until I found his ""Legends of Acid Jazz"" in the cut-out bin at Newbury Comics a few years ago. There's nothing groundbreaking to his music, just some great soul jazz from a true bluesy gospel horn-honker. I was impressed enough to purchase another half-dozen discs by this artist, all of which are currently going out-of-print. This disc collects the original Prestige LPs ""Blue Gator"" and ""Cookin' Sherry,"" recorded by Rudy Van Gelder over four different sessions from May 1959 through August 1960. A variety of great soul jazz musicians feature here including Jack McDuff, Bill Jennings, Wendell Marshall, Alvin Johnson, and even the great bassist Milt Hinton joins in on three tracks. Purchase the ""Legend"" of ""Gator Tail"" while you can."
3,"Interesting, but a bit of a slow read","Being a huge fan of the other two Tom Wolfe books I've read, ""The Bonfire of the Vanities"" and ""A Man In Full"", I was naturally curious to read Wolfe's first book. Unfortunately, I didn't find it to be as sharp or witty as his more recent work, possibly due to this one being non-fiction. I found it to essentially be a set of rambling observations about the state of life in America in the 60's. His choices of subject are clever and put a whole new spin on my view of the United States of the mid-twentieth century but on the whole I found large stretches of the book to be quite dry and, in my opinion, unnecessarily convoluted."
5,Why Isn't this a Movie???,Grattan has been writing and rewriting the Mexican-American experience for decades -- and far more eloquently than anyone on the literary scene. Why hasn't Hollywood scooped up this fabulous book??? It's about time!Kelly Hayes-RaittLivingLargeInLimbo.comAmazon.com/author/KellyHayes-Raitt
5,a gripping novel about turbulent times,"The Dark Side of the Dream is a brilliant, well written novel that follows the Salazar family from Mexico to the United States during the turbulent times of the 1940s and 1950s. The children fight in both World War II and for the rights of migrant workers on picket lines and in the birth of the Chicano movement. The descriptions of the people and the places make readers feel they are part of the scene. The difficulties of survival both in war and love are exceptionally well done. This page-turner is the best novel I have read about life for Mexican-Americans in the Southwest during these difficult times. I rate this novel as a must-read for its honest portrayal of the times and the characters with all their favorable traits and their flaws."
4,sarah lets it fly again with basie band,"Some twenty years after the album ""Count Basie and Sarah Vaughan,"" Sarah teamed up with the band again, and again, to our good fortune, decided to let her voice have free reign to fly through the auditory planes. No honey-sweet pop coatings (with one exception perhaps - the title track); nor does she try to please the critics. Instead, she challenges and ultimately persuades the listening ear to hear the rightness of her by-the-book, that is by-the-book-she-wrote, renditions."
2,Poor Quality,"I bought 3 DVDs featuring Richard Bustillo. I have watched them all, and can honestly say they are poor. He is a great instructor. Unfortunately this doesn't translate well onto his DVDs."
4,"Another good album from ""THE JUG""","No surprise that ""Bomojazz"" reviewed this rare album that no one seems to know about...you're a legend man. Yes a good date for Ammons indeed. The sound quality is not perfect, but good enough to enjoy thoroughly. This band souns very big for a trio, but when you have a decent organ player on stage it always sounds bigger. Gene plays well thoughout the whole show, especially on C Jam Blues. There is a nice ""flight of the bumblebee"" insert at the end of his solo on that track. Don't know how many copies are left out there, but it is worth picking up. I tend to play it loud."
3,Jazz stars,being from that era of the big jazz bands I met quite a few of the entertainers and those two were some of my favorites. I think the dvd was very clear
4,Attention New Teachers,"This book has useful information for any person wanting to persue teaching, especially in a urban classroom. Diversity in the classroom is more prevalent now and teachers are not prepared."
3,I do Not recommend this book.,"I was disappointed after finishing Crossing Over to Canaan.Some parts of the book were helpful such as: * Describing how the old beliefs of teaching effect the demands on (new) teachers * Theories of pedagogy * Reflective Practice * more.For the most part, however, I was quite bored and have read more helpful books than this. The book is coated in quotes taken from the different grad students journals about their experiences with Teach for Diversity. Very few - if any - strategies are shared about teaching in a diverse classroom. I was expecting something different than what it was. Please browse through the book before purchasing to see if it's what you're looking for!"
2,There are much better books out there,"I had to read this book for an education class, and it seemed obvious that this was just the published research of one project. Although there were some interesting parts, it was a bit too focused on that one project to be really that helpful."
3,Too old,"While it was very cheap, I would not purchase a 15 year old book again. As I intend to visit Central America in the future I should have purchased an up to date version. My fault."
4,SUPERB LATE TWENTIES BIG BAND,"The Cotton Pickers' recording career ran from July 1928 until September 1931, during which time they cut 55 sides, not counting alternate takes, the majority in the first three years. So this 22-track CD is a selective sampling of that period, and completists would do better to look elsewhere. The band had two distinguishing features, the advanced arrangements of Don Redman, which they played superbly, and his wistful vocals. From that point of view there is not a weak track in the compilation, but some of the clarity which is present on the original recordings has been lost in the remastering process, which somewhat diminishes the impact."
5,Step in the Right Direction,"This book, Step in the Right Direction, was in very good condition and a book that was basically as describedin its content."
3,Disappointing,"Made on 2 separate dates in 1961 with a big band, this album is not among Cannonball's best. Almost all the tempos are in the medium range, and the music seems to drag. ""West Coast Blues"" gets a nice playing, but the album on whole disappoints."
4,A great read for a student,"I bought this to prepare for an excavation in Belize Valley as was required by the field school. I didn't know what to expect from it but after reading this textbook, I found it to be an excellent read for any aspiring archaeologist or for anyone who really wants to learn about the ancient Mayans in more of an in-depth level. Like the previous post said, it's not for people who are just merely curious but for someone who wants to really study the subject. There are A LOT of technical terms so that may tend to bore people. But I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to understand more about the Mayans and their history!"
5,Speaks to me,"This devotional is just what speaks to my heart. Each day's letter appears to be written just to me. Each letter focuses on a different issue or struggle, we as women, may deal with in our daily lives. These letters are written very dearly as if God wrote them himself."
3,Not my kind of read,"Don't get me wrong, this isn't a poorly written book and I love that it has God's truth's all over in it. It's hard for me to review a book like this in general. Each page or two has a theme and then verses that go along with it for encouragement. This is generally the kind of book I steer clear from because it's not the kind of read I like. However, for someone who likes this kind of book, it is a neat reminder on how we are God's princess and how He loves and cares for us.I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review."
4,His Princess,I open the book to a random page each day to read the inspirational message which always helps me put things into perspective. It has helped me to start my day on a positive note.
4,His Princesses,"The idea of this book, is that as women, we should realize that we are princesses of our Heavenly Father. The letters inside are written to us to uplift us. Some are even written by our Savior, Jesus Christ.I have found it to be a great book to read here and there. It is not something you just sit down and read one Saturday afternoon. I have kept it in my car, so when I'm being super mom and waiting for kids (from school or their other activities) it is great to open up the book. Read a few letters and feel uplifted."
5,Uplifting and Encouraging,This little book is helpful in understanding one's identity as a child of the King. It's very reassuring and theologically sound. Great for daily devotional reading.
5,"""His Princess"" is wonderful!","This book/devotional grants such beautiful confirmations of The Lord's unconditional love to us. It reaffirms His truth in every page that our identity is totally in Him! I feel and take in His love for me with each and every page! Great gift idea for all of ""God's Princess's"". Love it 5000%! But it can never replace the Bible, God's Word and truth to us! Amen! :D"
5,Beautiful gift for any woman--young or old,"This lovely book, which is illustrated on every page, is a series of devotions to the reader from the heavenly Father's perspective. Each reading is a wonderful gift, based on scripture, that helps the woman start or end the day feeling loved. I'm buying several for gifts--for my daughters and for graduation presents."
5,The King's gift to His Pincesses!,"As Christian women, we can be so overwhelmed by the daily tasks and things we have to handle and sometimes we would get so tired and weary, we start to doubt our self worth, and we sometimes feel unappreciated and unloved, but this beautiful book reminds us how precious we are in our God's eyes. As he is the King of kings, we are his daughters and HIS PRINCESSES!Every little passage tells a love story of how much our King is in love with us. It is so nice to be reminded that we are precious and important by someone who should matter the most --- our Lord! I love the beautiful flora designs in the book and I keep it with me in my purse because I want to take it everywhere with me, so when I feel sad or tired, I can just open this little book and be reminded again how much I am loved!"
4,Great Little Devotional,"This is the perfect devotional book. Small enough to fit into a purse or a coat pocket. You can easily take this book with you where ever you go. The book is divided into short readings centered around a verse. The verse and the readings are designed to remind you just how much The King loves his Princess and wants what is best for her. There are 91 short little devotionals in this book. The devotionals are written as a love letter, always ending with a love from your King.I really enjoyed these short little reads, often finding myself reading more than one at a time. Quite often the topic seemed to really hit a spot, often just want I needed to hear at that moment. I will be picking this little book up many times to re-read the little gems included in this book."
5,Don't Miss Out on This Book!,"I was deeply moved by this book! I spent much of December and January reading each letter in this book and came away feeling more deeply loved by my Heavenly Father. This book is a treasure! A wonderful encouragement for women to see your worth, to know you are loved by a Father above, and can have a deep relationship with Him who loves you most! He is the one who knows you best! Find hope, love, and peace as you read letters from your Heavenly Father! Don't miss out on this book!"
5,Rich illustrations make even skeptics believe in the fairies,"Cicily Mary Barker portrays accurate floral depictions with vibrant imagination.The fairies are endearing and realistic.Her exquisite illustrations and quaint, lovely poems are a joy for readers of all ages.Especially delightful in this edition is the Hollyberry Fairy."
2,smaller than I thought,This book was alot smaller in size than I thought. I have the other 3 in the larger editions and they are all gifts for my god-daughter.
1,Lomanco,"The photograph is not for the unit being sold. The unit being sold is actually a Thermostat, not a combination Thermostat/Humidistat as reflected in the photograph. Complaints made to Amazon and the vendor regarding the discrepancy went unanswered. There were no problems returning the unit, however, I am now out-of-pocket the return postage and insurance."
4,Great old days jazz,"This is one of if not the most special of New Orleans' clarinetists from the 20's. These old recordings are in pretty good shape, and along with Dodds you get to hear several other excellent jazz players from that era. For those that are still in grief over the loss of Michael Jackson, this may not help, but for those that love deep jazz, you'll find this a treat from the old days."
5,Amazing book,"I first read this book years ago and cannot forget it. The authors portrayal of the supernatural weaving it's way into everyday life is wonderful and seems so realistic. Her characters are amazing too. There is nothing superficial about these people or this book. I will be reading this book over and over, likely for the rest of my life."
5,"Suspensful, Entertaining - A Must Read","This is truly a brilliant book. It was on my reading list for a Uni class, and I wasn't altogether sure that I would like it - but I did. Loved it in fact. It had everything a book should have - a great story, very believable and in depth characters, suspense, a touch of romance, and a lot of thought and feeling. There are very few writers who can talk to a teen (or anyone else for that matter) the way Mahy does. She talks to everyone on their own level - she is never condescending as writers for young adults can tend to be. She recognises her audience as people, not 'kids'. The supernatural theme in this book is fabulous, I found it really engaging and exciting. Yet, if not for this factor, I felt I could have been the main character in my earlier years - the same thoughts and feelings coming through that I still identify with today. Mahy is able to do all this, and much more, whilst still keeping it all realistic. Buy this book - you won't regret it."
4,The human side of Shinto,"For someone interested in the ""human"" side of Shinto religion, Nelson's book is a fascinating study of a religion little understood by most westerners. Its best to skip the introductory chapters, which are a bit pedantic and dry, and start with the actual description of shrine activities. Nelson is most interesting when talking about the priests and their relationship with Shinto, their ""parishioners"" and each other. Ultimately, it is this sort of writing that convinces the reader that Shinto is not a bunch of exotic rituals, but has a very real meaning and value in its followers lives. Written in 1996, Nelson poses a number of questions about Shinto's future throughout the book. It would be interesting if a second edition of the book was published updating the reader on the present activities of the shrine and its priests."
5,A midwest memoir to remember,"I read this book a year or two ago, but remembered it again recently while reading Wendy Werris's new memoir, An Alphabetical Life, because both reflect such a love of books. To people like Dirda and Werris - and me - books are nearly as important as eating, loving, breathing. And that affinity is so astutely reflected here in Michael Dirda's story of his childhood in Lorraine, Ohio. It's a midwest boyhood to the nth degree, albeit one of a kind of nerdy, bookish unathletic kid. I was a kid like Mike. I could relate. If you grew up in the fifties and sixties and loved books, then don't miss this one. It will take you back - to those dusty, second-hand bookstores you found with such joy, and to your folks yelling at you to ""getcher nose outa that book and go outside for a while! It's a beautiful day, dammit!"" Like that. Thanks for sharing your kidhood, Mike. - Tim Bazzett, author of Reed City Boy"
4,Close to Classic Yes,"I wasn't a YES fan until the mid 90's and I started off with the YES YEARS box set purchased for me by my 30+ year old sister...so the early 90's ""issues"" the band had was news to me until I found the Anderson, Bruford, Wakeman, Howe album listed on Amazon(it was poor to say the least). I had purchased it at the same time as this album so I was a little nervous about Re(Union)...According to the other reviews on this site, I had my expectations low, but was assuming that two bands could come up with an albums worth of decent music...especially when it gets reworked a decade later.I was pleasantly surprised...I never listened to the original release, so I don't know what I am missing off it(if anything worthwhile). This is way closer to the sound I have been used to since starting my fixation with extended songs full of changing rhythm, tempo and chords.4 out of 5 compared to 70's YES, but a nice attempt. Recommended."
4,Great!,I really like this CD. Her voice is just lovely. Kind of reminds me of Natalie Merchant. Highly recommended.
5,If you only buy one CD,This is the one that you want. Great from start to finish. This young lady has amazing talent.
5,One of my favorite Pre de Provence soaps,"Smells great, leaves skin soft. I can't say much else about it. We love the brand, and I'm working my way through the gamut."
4,Nice Album,"this is a dark, but really nice album. In fact, the Inspiral Carpets were a dark, nice band. It's a pity that they got lost. Beast Inside is a very good cd, with different styles of songs: epic, ballads, faster songs, this is a cool reminder of the 90 pre-Oasis.Este es un oscuro, pero lindo album. La banda en sí era oscura y buena. Lástima que se hayan perdido así. Beast Inside en un muy buen cd, con diferentes estilos de canción: épicas, baladas, y temas más rápidos, este es un buen recuerdo de los 90 pre-Oasis."
4,Good choice,"The stand is just what I needed. The TV in on the kitchen bar. The stand allows me to simply touch the TV edge to point the screen to the washing, cooking or table area. Very smooth operation.The photo is a little deceptive. The black swivel is what you are buying. The stand below is not included and has to be purchased separately."
4,turns great but a little loose,"It holds very nicely with a 32 inch LCD TV and turns smoothly. Looks it can hold much larger LCD TV. The style also goes very well with the black trim of TV. My only complaint is that it doesn't hold the position very well--it won't work on a tilt surface or when the cable is very tight. Other than that, a well-made product."
1,Beware -the shelf is not included!!!,The photo leads the buyer to believe that this item includes the shelf. It does not. You will receive only the swivel base (the black disc in the photo). Buyer beware!
1,Not like the picture!,"Based on the picture, it looks as though you are getting a stand and a swivel base. Read the description very, very carefully because it is only the swivel base. Since that's all it is, that's all that should be in the picture. How disappointing. Hope my refund doesn't take too long."
5,Just what I needed!,"This ""Lazy Susan"" rotating TV stand is just perfect! My computer desk is right next to me TV table, so I was watching it from the side or scratching my furniture if I tried to move the TV. Now, I just twist the TV and it moves -- doesn't interfere with my cable hook up or anything. I'm completely pleased!Marnieann"
4,Good buy,"Purchased for a 39"" LCD tv. Stand is perfect. It allows us to use external devices without moving furniture. If you buy this, you won't regreat."
4,Excellent,This product is exactly what I was looking for. My LCD 32'' fits perfect on it and the 360 rotation is great.
1,Not the real thing,"There's very little Brazil in these nights. Good musicianship but an enormous eagerness to sell, what is not bad per se but produces something that could be made by virtually any decent pop star around."
1,No good,How do you screw up logs burning in a fireplace? The actual fireplace is featureless. It is nothing more than a smooth box. It is devoid of character. You cannot even see the grate. It is as if the logs were burning in some sort of metal furnace. The actual fire is little better. The flames are so overwhelming that you can't see the logs. They are only black silhouettes.
4,Absorbs so quickly and feels wonderful,"Enchanted Eye Cream Moisturizer is awesome. You only need a little bit to take care both of your eyes and the moisturizer absorbs almost instantly! The skin around my eyes feel great after and my make up goes on with no problems at all.The only bad things is the fact that there is no SPF in the cream and the packaging. Skin around your eyes are very thin so SPF would be great, but my makeup has SPF in it so that's not a big problem for me. As for the pump LUSH gives with this product... it's so-so. For $18 a bottle, I would have expected better packaging. The pump gives you way more then you really need, so you have to resort to trying to get the perfect amount out everytime. Even if you hardly push the pump down, you still get a bunch of cream. Would have been 5 stars if the packaging was a little better and didn't waste so much product.Minor negatives compared to the positives!"
1,No Visible Results,"I find most Lush products to be more for fun and entertainment than actually having benefits for the skin.This eye cream isn't really fun or entertaining, and it certainly doesn't perform any miracles around the eye area. Very expensive for a cream that doesn't have visible results. I recommend finding something with anti-aging/anti-wrinkle benefits."
3,trunk speaker,Needs 16 cu.ft. enclosure. Don't do what I did and buy on reviews alone. Sounds ok for muddy bass. Ended up in the garage instead of the house.
2,Content fine,"The content of this book is fine. However, the binding is not of very good quality and I could find nothing on the book that said 'bonded leather."" I personally do not believe it is bonded leather but instead is some kind of pressed paper. The print size is nice and the gilting on the pages very attractive."
1,kindle edition impossible to navigate,"This was one of my first purchases for my Kindle 3G. It has been a nightmare to try to navigate during services.There is no way to go directly to the page one wants. It has proven to be useless. I am back to my old copy of the Book of Common Prayer, which I now appreciate more that ever.It proved to be a waste of money and time. It has been my worst Kindle purchase."
2,Unreadable tables,"In the Kindle version, many of the tables (daily readings, for example) are inserted as graphics, which makes them impossible to read."
3,[Kindle Edition] Index to Psalms would be a BIG help!,"After my experiences with books not, or at best poorly, indexed I proceeded with this with some trepidation. The sample showed that it was indeed indexed, but in playing with it I have found no index into the Psalms. They can be found by searching for ""Psalm 23"", for example, so it's not serious, and of course there is no such index in the print version.But this seems otherwise fine, and there is no problem whatsoever with the binding in the Kindle Edition. ;^)"
5,Gorgeous Language,"The 1928 Book of Common Prayer is quite simply one of the greatest, most Christ centered, intelligent, moving collections of prayers ever written. It deserves 10 stars!"
1,Never got it!,"The dealer sent the book but I never received it. I broke the old rule: NEVER, NEVER, NEVER send anything of value through the USPS."
5,A Hidden Gem!,"One of my favorite albums of all time. I remember buying the album on cassette on the strength of the single ""Talk It Over."" I was not only blown away by Grayson Hugh's songwriting, but his strong soulful vocals and keyboard playing as well. ""Bring It On Back,"" ""Finally Found A Friend,"" and ""Hard Life,"" truly stand out. What a hidden gem, and it still stands the test of time."
1,order not received,"still waiting for this item , sent emails and no reply. Over a month now . I would never buy again from Amazon"
2,Teacher,"Our class had finished reading ""Touching Spirit Bear"" by Ben Michaelson and I ordered this as an extension to the lesson with information about the real spirit bear. This is a poorly done film and could not keep my students engaged."
3,"A real ""feel-good"" movie that the whole family can watch together.","I purchased this movie as a fan of Graham Greene but ended up really enjoying both the movie and the acting. No, it will not win any awards but is definitely worth seeing especially if you can watch it with your children. Perhaps it may even inspire them for the future."
2,Disappointing,"I learned about the Spirit (Kermode) Bears over a decade ago and fell in love with them instantly. This movie however was a complete disappointment-very predictable, and not enough character background. I gave it away."
4,Now That's The Spirit,"This is a really good movie for kids and based on a true person/event, but I have to give it 4-stars for the little bumps in the filming. There are several instances where you ask yourself ~ Why was that in the movie? You have to remember that this is a movie for kids, so not every adult is going to enjoy it. But there are so few movies out there for kids to watch that are clean and wholesome, that you just have to ignore the poor acting and moments of terrible filming. It is a Canadian film and there are a few instances of questionable language included. (Burn in he**, a**, bloody, friggin, stupid) This film deals with doing the right thing and fighting for what you think is right. There is a character who likes to shoplift, but the main character does not approve of it. In the end the two teenagers engage in a simple kiss. If your children are into animals they should like this movie. I believe its speed and subject matter is best suited for children 8 and up."
3,it's an ok movie,"this movie is ok, but if you think this is a wildlife movie you would be wrong. most of the movie is filmed in a city and a courtroom. but for what i paid for it i can't complain too much."
3,Spirit Bear,"Clearly this was a made for TV movie so it is good for the whole family to see. My 83 y/o mother loved it. I was hoping to see a bit more of Graham Greene, but such is life. The movie sends a message that if youth work together with others great things can be done. It also gives a message that if youth follow through strongly with their beliefs it is important. The film also portrays a clear picture of the effects of clear cutting that the timber industry employs and how political the process is both in Canada and by inference, here in the States."
3,Like Lemon Curry?,"Another album which defies easy description or classification. Imagine an alternate universe in which the Beatles started out as an Indian raga band instead of a British skiffle band, and then years later somebody decided to update and modernize those old raga songs.That's not really the whole picture here - Madooo grew up in India, toured the Midwest with a Vietnamese band, and is known for his Elvis and Jim Morrison impersonations -this CD is a mix of Western rock and Indian percussion.Beatles music helped introduce sitar music and some of Hindu culture to America, it's clear from this CD that Beatles music was influential introducing Western rock to India as well."
4,50 answers to a very good question,"This fine book by Stephen Webb offers fifty different solutions for the Fermi paradox. In short, Enrico Fermi wondered that since universe is so big and should contain lots of life, where are they? Why haven't we seen any evidence at all of extraterrestrial intelligence?Well, there are plenty of good explanations, as this book proves. The solutions are divided in three categories: ""they're already here,"" ""they exist but we can't communicate with them,"" and ""we're alone"". Since there's a real lack of proper knowledge about these things, reader will find plenty of educated guesses, hazy probabilities and that sort of thinking, but that's the nature of the whole question.I'd definitely recommend this book to anybody who's interested in the existence or non-existence of extraterrestrial life. While there are no set answers, this book will give the reader a lot of material to chew on. (Review based on the Finnish translation.)"
2,where is everybody?,"The premise of this book is strong (is there life in the universe?)and it is entertaining, but the conclusion has a simple math error that ruined the entire book. The math error is on page 238 (Step 5). Mr. Webb gets his multiplication wrong and it makes me believe that the rest of the book is a farce. Luckily I read the conclusion at the beginning."
1,No Information,"It would sure be nice if, particularly absent photos, Seller told us what this bracket does. Is it the tool (miter saw) mounting bracket for Ryobi and Rigid stands and saws? If so, does it include both brackets or do you need to buy two which is what typically is needed. See, e.g., the DeWalt brackets. Is it a specialized bracket that accepts tools other than miter and chop saws? If so, which ones? Perhaps it is a replacement leg bracket? Or perhaps something else that has not yet crossed my mind?"
4,Best recording on a cd I have ever heard!,"The ""No Rules"" disc was produced by Dana Strum and I can honestly say that I believe this is the best recording I have ever heard. Well, the first Fight disc, ""War of Words"" may tie as the best recording along with this one. Anyway, there is an incredible amount of depth to this recording. Really rockin 80's style metal, kind of like Slaughter mixed with Slick Toxik and maybe a dose of heavy Ratt. My only complaint is that the vocalist tends to kinda sound like Axel Rose at times. Excellent musicians. Hard to believe that this was their only full length disc. If you missed out on this in the hair days, then get it now."
4,Just Missed It,"As a huge fan of the glam metal scene, I found this to be a very good album. I sampled it online and I am very impressed. It is a shame they hit the scene too late to break into the mainstream. I'm not sure how they are compared to GNR, but I think they sound more like a mix of Dangerous Toys, Black & Blue and Saigon Kick. They should have made it big."
2,Get what you pay for....,One minor disclaimer the snow was not super thick. The sled is fun just not durable. After one day of use I have had to patch the sled in 5 places... The bottom is in my view to thin given how the sled is used.
4,Excellent Stories,"I listened to the abridged audio version, so I did not get to hear the ""Bees"" and some of the other stories that the other reviewers liked. Of the stories I heard I thought that ""Heaven Lake"" was the best. It is a remarkably moving reflection by a father recalling an incident from his youth in New York City, the remorse he feels about it, and how he reconciles it with the advanced philosophy he teaches and with his relationship with his daughters. A first rate story. Also very interesting was Doctorow's ""Baby Wilson"", a rather funny and poignant story of people on the margins of American life who long for inclusion.But I do wish they would include all the stories in a collection like this."
3,GOOD COLLECTION,"THIS IS A GOOD COLLECTION OF SHORT STORIES, ALTHOUGH NOT AS PROFOUND AS DESCRIBED BY MR. MOSELY IN THE INTRODUCTION. I ENJOYED THEM, BUT CANNOT HONESTLY SAY, THAT I'D GO ABOUT ASSERTIVELY RECOMMENDING THE COLLECTION TO FRIENDS. THE READERS WERE ALL VERY GOOD."
3,A selection from MFA Land,"Sigh. Not that most of these stories are actually bad but they do suffer from what an earlier reviewer called a ""constricted cautiousness"". Besides, maybe I've read too many of these types of pieces already but wow - are some of the themes here familiar. For example, being working-class in America (or a working class immigrant) really pounds rocks. And hey - there sure is a lot of quiet desperation in them there suburbs. Yawn yawn yawn."
2,Not that great...,"What has happened to literature? These stories are poorly written in my opinion. If these are the best, I'd hate to see the worst American short stories. Take ""Moriya"", a piece of trash written by Dean Paschal included in this collection for example. Hey Dean: just because no one has written a story about an adolescent ""mecahnical minded"" boy fantasizing, masturbating, and having sex with a doll doesn't make your story great literature. I've given up one American writing for the present..."
2,Benq remote,"Flimsy, cheaply made,very perfunctory remote for a projector that had originally retailed for five thousand dollars!!! Might note that this remote also went with the DreamVision CinexOne projector."
3,rock in Chinese,I would like to read the digist about book. I am interested in rock in garded in China.
1,hard to find the correct size,I had bad luck with theses gloves. I had to send the first pair back because they were too large. The small size was still a little too big for my hands. I now assume that they were mens sizes. There is no information on selecting the correct size. I tried them out at home and after 30 min of paddling they were rubbing and hurting my hands. The fabric is rough and not very stretchy. I took them on a 4 day kayak trip for a friend to wear. He also found them uncomfortable. They may have been to small for him. I did notice an other paddler in our group was wearing a pair with no problems.
4,Timex Marathon Indiglo Stopwatch,"I selected this stopwatch from the many others simply because it has the indiglo feature, and I need to operate in subdued lighting.Other advertised features are similar to many other stopwatches.In use, I have found it to be quite satisfactory. The readout is clear and large enough to be read at a glance. I have not had the need to explore all of the features, but it does all that I would like it to do quite well. There is a short learning curve, but not insurmountable.If night vision is an issue, this is the only one.... if night vision may be a requirement in the future, it is still the only one. Otherwise, it performs at least equally as well as any others available."
5,Classic Perry Mason,"To be honest, it has been many years since I read this book, and I can't even remember any of the details. However, I'm reviewing it based on how I felt about it at the time (and still do). This was classic Perry Mason all the way. If you love the TV show, like me, but have trouble keeping up with the frantic pace of what is going on in the courtroom, then you'll love the books. It gives you all the time you want to try and figure it out. I have read five of his books, and have never figured out ""who done it"" but I keep trying =). It's always fun at the end of the book when Perry is telling Dela and Paul how he came to his conclusions, and neatly wraps everything up.I honestly can't imagine any Perry Mason book being bad. This one certainly wasn't. Give it a read!"
3,average selection of tracks....but MoS is still MoS,"Overall it's a decent collection, and most of the tracks meet a clubber's requirements, but i don't find any of the tracks exceedingly great. The MoS Annuals of 2004 and 2005 are certainly a better buy."
3,Fearsome account of life-and-death struggle,"The desperation of Lance Corporal Rother is tempered by his dependence on his training, the tradition of the Corps, and his devotion to it. While initially distracting, the time-warp sequences engage the reader with the brutality of war and the sacrifices made under fire. Tales of undaunted courage compelled by discipline and duty are inspiring, despite the tragic suffering endured. The frustration, pain, and heroism are vividly and brutally portrayed in the continuum. Sadness and despair for the protagonist are transformed into an understanding of duty, faith, honor and the warrior spirit"
2,Cool looking but hot to wear,It's a big piece of rubbery material strapped on your wrist. Not great in summer. It makes your wrist sweat and when you wash your hands the water stays under the band. It's cool looking but not practical at all.
5,Great music,I used to own the CD but lost it over the years. Was extremely happy to find it on amazon. Vasco Rossi's best cd in my opinon
5,Superbe,"Tr?s grand album de McLean, superbes improvisations. Cet album doit faire partie de la collection de toute personne aimant le Jazz."
5,scary,I read this book in high school and thought it was sooo scary! I wanted to read it again to see if I thought it was really scary! Can't wait to finish readying it because it is a thriller:)
1,Worst colander ever,I have had this item less then 3 months and seldom use it. The enamel is chipping off from the inner center of the colander which makes it unusable to me. I was draining beans in it over the weekend when I noticed chips of enamel in my food. I was so distraught and had to throw away my food. I contacted the manufacturer and sent them e-mail asking them to replace the item. I haven't heard back from them. I wouldn't buy any more items from this manufacturer.
2,"Enamel chips, metal rusts","I am still using this colander after a few years, but my husband is nagging me to replace it. Like other reviews state, the enamel is chipping and the metal is rusting. This is only happening for me on the bottom of the colander, so it's not getting into the food and I'm still using it. However, I'm sure it's only a matter of time before the rest of it begins to chip and rust. Save your money, buy something else."
1,Didn't meet expectations,This book didn't have the information in it that I needed on how to prepare invitational services. I do not recommend this book to anyone.
4,Not much of a plot...,"But seriously, this is a good, comprehensive, helpful manual. It covers the different makes in separate chapters, doesn't try to give you some useless generic advice, instead providing specific, well illustrated, useful repair advice."
1,snowmobile hand book by chilton,not realay to be use for proffessional mecanic this book is made for a beguinner is better to buy a original tech book from a compagny like yamaha or artic cat
1,bad leather,"The quality of the leather is really bad and it even had a deep cut, better try with another product"
2,Verbal Self-defence,"At first seemed like a great book (after a few minutes browsing) but when I got home and read it in depth, I nearly puked at the sight of how corny it was. There are so many bad points about this awful book that I will not even waste time listing them, however one aspect which I must point out is that the author tried to make the subject humourous, which I found to be very unappropriate and disturbing; Myself personally and my sister have been victims of severe verbal abuse as kids, and I really do not find the subject to be a laughing matter. The style of the book was too light-hearted (with all those silly cartoony illustrations) for a subject like verbal abuse, that disgusted me."
3,Don't pay full price.,I am glad I didn't pay full price for this book. I know the basics; I was looking for more techniques and more indepth information.
1,"A Forced, Cutesy Book with No Relevance to 9/11","I've tried and tried to figure out what the relationship is between fifty babies from fifty states, all concieved around January 2001, and the Sept. 11 attacks. A better book would have been on the babies concieved in the wake of September 11, though that predicted ""baby boom"" never appeared. At least the babies and the book would have some relevance to the attacks. As it is, this gimmicky book hits the easy success marks of patriotism and photos of cute babies, but little else. A well-intentioned but misguided book."
1,One way to make money out of a tragedy,"One way to make money out of a tragedy. How about giving ALL the monies from the sale of this book to charity and not just ""a portion"" to show you didnt do this just for the money."
5,Will put a smile on your face......,"This is a book that has to put a smile on your face. These babies are not only adorable, but they are so innocent. I give Mrs. Naman alot of credit for successfully putting this book together. It was thoughtful of her to reach out to other mothers delivering a baby on such a bittersweet day. With new life, there is always hope. God bless the USA"
2,Less than you'd expect,"I bought this for my daughter who was also born on 9/11. The book is small 6""x6"",and the photos are grainyand low quality.Of course the babies are cute and each page has a sentence from the parents telling their hopes and wishes for thier children.The inclusion of Christina Taylor Green adds a sad poignancy to the book. I had hoped for some personal accounts from the parents, or the author,but the book only contains one or two sentences per page. I paid less than $3 for it which was fair for such a thin volume, would not have wanted to have spent more than that though."
1,"baby pictures, nothing more",This is a small book 6x6 and it is just pictures of babies born on 9/11. Nothing about how the families were changed or moved by the tragedy. My granddaughter was born on 9/11 and we have collected all sorts of 9/11 info for her to someday understand the significance of her birthday. Who needs a picture book of other kids born on your birthday? I expected more.
5,Deborah Coleman CD,"I recently purchased the Deborah Coleman ""Soul Be It"" CD. It came as promised and in excellent condition. Besides the CD being one of the best blues albums I've ever heard, I highly recommend this seller."
5,WHEW,"I just got home from watching and listening Deborah Coleman preform. She played many of the tracks tonite including ""Brick"" and the last cut on the Cd, a 14 minute masterpiece,""Goodbye Misery."" WHEW is about all i can say. This woman truly plays her butt off. The live recording is one of the best i've heard and i highly recommend it."
5,Deborah Coleman - great r & b party,"Had the privilege of being present at this date: June 30 at the Sierra Nevada Big Room in summertime Chico. Absolutely the most fabulous show in a while. We danced, sweated, swayed, and rocked out to this lady's music. I've heard a couple of cuts but believe me, if you love blues, r&b, dance and soul, get this NOW."
1,Mediocre Talent!!,"I've been a blues fan for over 20 years and I've heard the best of the best. Ms. Coleman doesn't exite me one bit; in fact I'm a little embarrassed for Blind Pig Records for letting this one out. Her voice is extremely choppy and forced, and she cannot handle those decending R&B inflections she's attempting on her songs. She is very unsoulful, and her guitar playing is mediocre, dragging out uninspiring solos for 3 or 4 minutes or more on this live disc. Compare her voice to Susan Tedeschi or her playing to Debbie Davies and she's KO'ed in the 1st round. I was really hoping that she would be the next big blues artist to carry the torch, especially being a beautiful black female guitar slinger (she's the only one out there), but she dropped it before she ever made it to the starting line. Sorry..."
5,IT LAST LONG!!!!,"I HAD CHARGERS THAT I PURCHASED AT THE WIRELESS STORES, AND THEY ONLY LASTED A FEW WEEKS. THIS CHARGER IS SMALL, GREAT TO TRAVEL WITH. IT HAS LASTED ME ABOUT FOUR MONTHS NOW. I LOVE IT. IT CHARGES MY PHONE VERY QUICKLY. ITS GREAT."
4,The Real Dream Team,"With original members Aquaman, Superman, Batman, Green Lantern, Flash, Wonder Woman and Martian Manhunter - and, later, the Green Arrow and Atom - this best-selling comic book team debuted in The Brave and the Bold #28 (1960), which is part of this volume.Other titles are The Brave and the Bold #29-#30, Mystery in Space #75 and the initial sixteen titles from the JLA. Along with the sidekick Snapper Carr, the super heroes face a mostly second-tier lineup of bad guys, but the story lines swiftly move along and simplify what could have been a very difficult task in juggling so many stars.A wonderful journey down memory lane, the comics are a timeless lesson in working together and placing egos aside for the team."
1,BOOOOOOORING!,"I have read over 50 Marvel essentials and DC Showcase presents comic books. this is the one showcase presents book that I didn't even want to finish. some of those characters are great in their own comic books but they had so much more potential than this.""Spoiler Alert"" The stories were ridiculously cheesy such as Starro the giant intelligent space starfish, Despero from Kalanor,and random bad guys from space. DC could have done so much better than this and overall I really did not like this book."
1,So awful it hurts!,"I finally had the chance this ""movie"". It is so awful it hurts just to watch. Only the Scify Network woul;d show a movie this bad. The acting is non-existent. This ""Thor"" is a puny weakling looking for his hammer which Loki also wants to posses and he finds himself in earth with a woman (maybe Sif) I don't know who she was since I didn't paid much attention to it. Th hammer looks like a prop made by a second grader for a school play. Anyway, don't waste your money on this. This is just a movie looking to cash in on the Thor movie popularity. I just pretended that I have never seen it and that way I save myself from the torment of watching my favorite Asgardian destroyed in live action movie."
4,EXCELLENT FILM FROM THE ASYLUM,"Well I liked this version a lot, very Entertaining.Knocking this type of movie is counter productive to the genreIts just a fun movie.Its not meant to be a masterpieceCody Deal did a good job as Thor.With Patricia Velasquez Kevin Nash and Richard GriecoProduction values are first rate.Shot in Wide Screen 2.35.1 The picture quality is impressive.While no where near as good as THOR The Big Budget Versionwhich cost rather a lot more than this .never the less this is Great in the tradition of The Asylum Sci-Fi films.This is also available in Germany in English & German on Bluray.Highly Recommended."
4,almighty Thor,"This movie was ok. the mallet thor used looked like crap, foney. but the movie was ok. there was a hot babe in this movie"
3,A great source of comic relief,"If you are looking for good writing, acting, or action, run away from this movie! However, I have chosen to rate this at three stars because I didnt stop laughing the entire time. This was certainly not at all the intent of the writers or the cast, but I would describe it as so incredibly bad that it was almost good."
1,Maybe the worst movie ever made,Fight scenes are like watching rock em sock em robots with swords.So bad It's not even good for camp loves.
1,Thor=Snore,"Since this is an Asylum film, I expected a good pile of cheese to go with the movie.Would that I were so lucky. Ragnarok is open the world, and Loki is trying to get the Hammer (I guess mjolnir, but they never call it that) in order to finish off the nine worlds. Loki isn't Thor's half-brother here - he seems to be some kind of evil devil totally unrelated to the gods. Anyway, after wiping out Asgard, only Thor survives - saved by a valkerie maiden with a mexican accent (lots of that in Nordic heaven, I take it).The fight then moves to Los Angeles, where Thor dukes it out with Loki in the same alley over and over. This could all be campy fun, but Thor is a whiny idiot who will grind on your nerves 10 minutes into the movie. The nine worlds are finally saved at the very end when Thor whips up a 2nd magic hammer in less than 10 minutes and beats Loki senseless with it somehow...Spare yourself and watch something - anything - else."
3,Not a bad DEAL,"Not a bad introduction for newcomer Cody Deal. The film was pretty good until the scenes switched to the city; at which time what could have been a pretty good film went south in a flash. Although the film proved itself to be a low budget film, Deal's acting ability certainly can't be pinned as a disaster. What's imploring is Richard Grieco, Kevin Nash and Patricia Velasquez's poor contribution. So much for the not so rich and definitely not so famous. Pretty pathetic when a newcomer kicks all 3 out of the ball park."
1,Terrible,"I saw this with a friend for the heck of it just after seeing the Marvel Thor movie, and it was just about the worst pile of junk I've ever seen. Not just a misfire quickie from The Asylum but a complete pointless mess. Not even fun as a bad movie."
1,Almighty BORE ... SUCK MY HAMMER !!!,"If it says Why-Fi Channel, RUN !!!I have never seen them do one misproduction right.> NOT A TYPO <Save your $$$ & watch the other version.2 buns down ...My toilet is more interesting.:("
1,Very poorly done..,"This is not the comic book Thor and it is a very poor adaptation of the original legend (if that is what was intended) which it has corrupted on several important points.The casting is bad, most noticeably with a Latino as a Valkyrie. The directing is bad, the acting is bad, and even the CG effects are poorly done. If you must see this abomination, get a free account on Netflix and watch it before you buy it."
1,"Wow, that was bad!","Been a long time since I've seen a movie this bad. I actually laughed at how bad some of the special effects were. For example, Thor stabs Loki thru the head with a sword, and lets go of the sword. Loki reaches up to hold the sword that's sticking out of his head (in preparation for pulling it out), and his hand is shaking so bad that you can see the sword shaking while it's supposedly stuck in his head.One way they could have really improved the story was for Odin to have killed Loki at the beginning of the movie. That way the movie could have ended, and I would have only lost 15 minutes of my life..."
4,A fitting tribute to Maiden,"The album as a whole is worth the money if your a fan of the bands on it, or maiden. Solitude Aeturnus, steel Prophet, Morgion, and Opera IX gave great renditions of what maidens' songs might have sounded like if created today."
2,"Worthwhile to Maiden freaks, but not excellent.","""A Call to Irons"" for the most part delivers the goods, particularly Steel Prophet's ""The Ides of March/Purgatory,"" Solitude Aeturnu's ""Hallowed be thy Name"" or New Eden's ""Phantom of the Opera."" The best track might be Opeth's ""Remember Tomarrow."" But where these bands succeed, others fail, such as Morgion's ""To Tame a Land"" and the absolutely awful rendition of""Rime of the Ancient Mariner"" from Opera IX. Guitar and drums are both pathetic here, but the vocals take the cake. Who's kidding who? Skip track 10."
5,Life with a seriously ill manic-depressive parent.,"The Dilemma is an excellent depiction of life with a severely ill manic-depressive parent, and the adaptations necessary for the family to survive as a unit.Ms. Goss' attention to detail, her wit, and the story she shares with us make for a spellbinding book. Brew a pitcher of iced tea and get comfortable, because you won't be able to put this book down!Treatment of manic-depression, or bipolar disorder, has improved by orders of magnitude in the last few years. But abuses by hospital staffers like the ones described in The Dilemma still continue."
2,"Boring toy, son never cared about it",I got this toy because it was on clearance and it had good reviews. My son never was really interested in it. Only good thing was it is machine washable. It ended up getting packed away pretty quickly because he never played with it.
2,Just a box opener,The blade is decent but the knife is not comfortable in the hand.It cannot be opened with one hand so it is of no use as a backup tactical knife.It is stiff to open and clumsy to close.There are better choices.
4,"nice knife, but buy the fullsize","Let me preface this by explaining that I've carried a folding knife with a clip in my pocket since I was 14. I've been through everything: Spyderco, kershaw, gerber, smith and wesson, ETC. I really like this knife design, it's lightweight and the handle fits well in my hands... Well it would if I was like 8. I know it says mini but this thing is SMALL. It'll serve me well until I buy another one but doing it again I would have bought the fullsize. It was super stiff when I opened it up, the blade was quite hard to open and the blade lock was WAY too stiff. It's part of the handle and I had to adjust it so my friends with less manly hands (and my girlfriend) could use it without issue. I just used some tools and bent the lock side of the handle and the belt clip until they were a bit looser and it'll work for now. Overall a good knife at a great price but a bit on the small side for me."
3,Great item but....,"I really like this knife. It was sharp out of the box, sturdy, and all around cool looking. The biggest negative is that it started to rust like a week out of the box."
3,Loved it until it broke,"I loved it as a general purpose knife - right size, light, looked neat but after about 9 months it broke and I could not get it fixed. I bought it at REI for $15 but for the Amazon price it might be worth buying then just throw away when it breaks...."
5,Great knife!,"This knife was exactly what I wanted. Small , very sharp and easy to carry. I would recommend this for anyone who likes to have a very compact and useful knife on hand."
5,Good Little Low cost knife,Good little everyday carry knife for boxes and etc. Great price. Second time as I lost first one. Serrated blade is cool.
4,Great little knife,Gerber just makes a good knife period. I will always go for gerber over anything for the price range. Gerber they are great knifes for the money.
4,Amazing Knife for the Price,"This knife has been in my pocket since it came in the mail. I have been consistently impressed with its durability and strength. I was slightly disappointed at the size, but that is my own fault for not trying other knives out in person first. Overall great buy!"
5,Great Pocket Knife!,Gerber always has been a dependable product. This knife is small yet sharp. It is lightweight which makes it ideal for carrying it in your pocket.
5,Practical for Concealed Defense,"This has been my knife of choice for a couple years. I carried it in Afghanistan, and carry it at home. I've trained pretty extensively in blade fighting, and this suits the results of my training very well. A very reliable choice for quick and easy access if needed in an emergency."
2,A cheap version of the normal Gerber airframe,"I have purchased a long line of gerber airframe knives from a local knife shop. I have enjoyed them all very much as they have been sharp, easy use, and the mechanics were solid and smooth. I bought this knife off Amazon, and it came in a plastic container, and the action is stiff, the locking mechanism does not mesh nicely with the blade, and the blade itself is rather dull. This is not the Gerber paraframe I am used to, very disappointed."
4,Kinda small,This knife was smaller than expected (I should have read the demensions) and doesn't have one-handed opening. Gerber makes great knives.
1,Dangerously unreliable lock,"I was given this knife as a Christmas present in 2010. Now, less than a month later, and after very little use, the blade lock almost never works. To lock the knife I must forcibly open the blade with both hands. Even then there is not much lock holding the blade open, so I can't trust it, and neither should you. The problem is design: instead of the lock being a separate, springy, hardened piece of the liner, it is a much thicker (and less springy) part of the frame itself.I've owned the same small Gerber folder for over 30 years, so this failure surprised me."
1,Don't buy junk,"Wait until it falls apart on you & you send it in for warranty, the last laugh will be on you."
2,Fine knife as long as you baby it....,"I have a tendency to be pretty easy on all of my knives. I got this one at a retail store and carried it for a couple of months. One day upon using it for very light prying of an object, the rivet that attaches the blad to the handle sheared off. I never bothered to send it in for warranty repair as it wasn't worth it to me. I have far too many other knives and this one didn't cost me enough to justify the hassle."
1,there's a reason it's so cheap.,"it always says [made in China] like any other Gerber knife, i bought this because it looked cool. there are no good things about this.con #1: very dangerous locking mechanismcon #2: cheap metalcon #3: cheap handlei always thought that Gerber was reliable.....i was wrong."
3,"Tiny little knife, -good quality","I have no one to blame but myself, the product's name:""Mini Paraframe"" should have been a warning...This is a case of getting exactly what you asked for, but not what you expected. I have owned a number of great Gerber pocket knives over the years, including a larger one that looked just like the picture...But when the package arrived, the whole knife, including the handle, was about the size of my index finger. I sheepishly looked back at the product description & realized I was guilty of buying without really looking. If you want a tiny little folding letter/package opener it's ok, but way too small (for me)for most practical chores. As always, if the price seems really low, make sure that you take a close look at product specs & are getting what you wanted. I am scoring this 3 stars not because of any defect, but I find it awkward & irritating to use with my very large hands. No hard feelings Gerber, Just fair warning to otrher readers out there."
3,too small,"I bought a gerber as my first knife it was an EZ out very ergonomic.this is as far removed from that as possible, small two hand opened not ambidextrous.the all steel handle is kinda funny as it is two pieces of some abrasive metal screwed together with pillar pins.there is no handle the same piece that frame locks is the handle, it feels ok but hard to tell.the blade is too tight and not easily adjustable for opening, for more info I will be reviewing on youtube later this week.tinmancr1 is the channel name"
2,"Nice blade, don't like the frame design","Bought this for pocket duty. The blade is great, very sharp, strong blade. the blade stayed sharp for a long time, and the serrated edge is nice. It is a very light knife due to the frame design. However, i cannot stand the frame lock design. It requires the use of your fingernail most of the time to unlock it. Some might like it but i can not stand it. also in pocket duty the open frame design traps a lot of lint and dust so i am constantly trying to clean it which is difficult."
4,"Pretty good knife, but rather small","This is a pretty good knife, the quality is good as expected from Gerber. The only thing that didn't suit my needs was the knife size. Due to the fact it is the ""mini"" version it is rather small and lacks the typical size I would expect. It also lacks a knob which you could use to flick the knife out quickly. If you are just looking for one to carry in your bag, or purse, this would be excellent, but if you are a guy who would wear this frequently, I would suggest getting the Paraframe I knife by Gerber."
3,Too small and frail,"I've owned one of these for a few years. I bought it because I was tired of people giving me crap about having such a large folding knife with me (a 3.5 blade). This definitely worked for those purposes, but frankly, it's just too small. I probably have larger than average hands, but I found it difficult to impart much pressure with this; the handle is just too small. It makes it difficult to do anything other than the most rudimentary tasks.I also snapped off the tip of this while doing a little light prying. It's most likely not rated for that sort of thing, but still, don't expect it to stand up to heavy abuse."
4,Tough Linerlock,"I bought this knife to participate in the Gerber Bonus Blade promotion.This knife has a very smooth open/close hinge. It is very very sharp. The liner lock is extremely tough to move to fold the knife!Pros: Sharp, smooth, light weight.Cons: Tough liner lock."
4,Very handy and versital knife....,"This is a very small knife which I carry in the change pocket of the jeans. It is very handy for everyday tasks of all types.The construction it adequate for something of this size and price range. I have used it continually over the holidays for cutting all types of boxes and cords, strings, etc. No problems. Blade has stayed tight and the knife has hex type screws that would permit you to re-tighten if they do come loose, which they have not....we will have to see how it holds up over the long haul.This knife was not expensive and I don't expect it to perform one that is a premium price. It/s a Gerber and I have found them to general be reliable."
4,Good Buy,This is a good value purchase. Sturdy and well designed.Check the screws when it arrives as they were not all tight on mine.
5,Hard-to-find fragrance from excellent seller,"I'm very happy to find this rare fragrance available in stock. The smell is unusual, vintage-style, reminds me slightly powdery violets - very soft, and not so long lasting (which I prefer). I buy it often as a gift to my close friends, and they like it too.Overall I'm happy with the purchase. The seller ships item fast, in a well packaged box. Unfortunately, the price went up by $10 since my first purchases, which was explained by difficulties in sourcing it from suppliers, which together with shipping costs might hit one's wallet; but IMHO it's well worth it if you like it the way I do."
5,The must have home manual,"This is the perfect gift for the newly married couples, new student, children leaving home for the first time, people entering the military, new homeowner, newly divorced, travelers, young and older home-makers and anyone that might need a good resource for domestic information. It is guideline that sets the pace for others to follow. It brings back the true art form of keeping a orderly home."
4,Home Comforts,"A wonderfully informative book of ""Home-keeping"". Perfect for women just starting out on their own or seasoned vets that wish to learn more or enjoy reading about keeping house in detail.Covers all anyone could ever wish to know. A perfect gift to a newly married wife or even a son, striking it out on his own."
2,Home of the Obvious,"This book was touted to have all sorts of insightful information, but instead it is just many many pages of the obvious. The writing is good and the author is sometimes entertaining, but the purpose of the book is not met. I don't think anyone needs a book to tell them to use tile cleaner for tile, soap scum cleaner for soap scum and a dust mop for dust."
1,Good topic but BAD book.,"My husband and I both have careers, and we both could use this kind of information for ways to keep our house better. However, this weighty tome is extremely difficult to use. You can't simply turn to a section and get the tips you need. Also, the author, who (to be honest) (...)has no background in this area, writes about herself, and, to be honest, I don't care about her thoughts or her life. I just want the information. I mean, if I have a stain in a sink or want some information on where to put the dessert spoon when I set the table, I don't want to wade through irrelevant ramblings from the writer. So, the bottom line is this: This is a good topic. But this is a BAD book."
1,Only for those raised by wolves...,"This will be brief, but I hope helpful. Do NOT order this book, as I did (I'm returning it) unless you were raised by wolves less nurturing than Romulus' and Remus' wolf-mother. Save yourself the money and watch Martha reruns or go to her website, or spend about 5 minutes in ANY home magazine. The author goes on for pages about the simplest things--which might sound good, but there are only so many ways to fold a pillowcase--and only one according to them, same with t-shirts, etc. There is a lot of erroneous information in the laundry section! Do not follow directions in this book unless you want to set a stain for good. A HUGE disappointment."
1,"Too many words, not enough data","I found this book to be too wordy. As a woman who works full time and keeps a house, I don't have time to understand, for example, WHY I'm eating lunch. I bought this book because I wanted an all-in-one easy reference guide, not an encyclopedic listing of impressive house related words.When I finally needed the book, however, it failed me. Living in a seaside community, I needed information on controlling mold in the home, and the book fails to describe what actions to take and/or whom to call with concerns. I'm sure this book works for true housewives who have the time to appreciate and read the author's beautiful prose, but I am not that person.I am going to donate this book to the local library in the hopes that someone else can benefit from it."
5,Great Reference-No need to hate the messenger,"This is a wonderful reference book. It is not a novel and does not need to be read cover to cover. A lot of the reviews in here are proving Ms. Mendelson's point that successful housekeeping is disdained by modern women. Once again, feminists elevate themselves by disparaging women who don't view life in an office cubicle as Nirvana. To the reviewer who said she had a real life to live and could pay someone else to iron her sheets, well Congratulations. But there are some women AND men in America who can't quite afford to contract out the care and maintenance of their homes...And someone has to do that stuff. If you prefer to hand the job to some impoverished, uneducated woman, go right ahead. But please don't act morally superior while you are doing it. This is a useful book that teaches the reader how to do any household job they might have a need to do. Period. We don't all employ nannies and maids, you know."
1,"""Martha Stupid Cleans House""","Oh Puleeze! I was so excited about this book. Especially since I am ""only"" a housewife and it would be wonderful to have homemaking elevated to the status it deserves. But taking ""joy"" in ironed sheets! Get a grip. And as previous reviewers noted it is excess verbiage--give me the Reader's Digest version. It may have really good information but I couldn't get past that the Martha Stewart-type manual of housecleaning--now there's a woman with too much time and too little reality on her hands! On the book jacket it says the only manual about housekeeping by a single author-so! I'd like to see the multi-author books maybe they'd have some balance in their books!"
1,skip it- hire a live in domestic,This book seems even too elementary for a 20 something. The advice given is not specific in areas where one would expect it and need it. The time needed to employ many of her cleaning techniques would keep the average homeowner a prisoner in his/her domicile for eternity and beyond. This book seems more of a tedious romanticized historical book on cleaning then a book that would help on any specific household cleaning task.
5,Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management redone for today!,Loved this book! Gave lots of ideas and tips to increase efficiency. It's a modern Mrs. Beeton and would make a lovely wedding gift. Enjoyable reading and not at all condescending - more like a housekeeping mentor to refer and defer to. I never thought housekeeping could be so interesting.
1,I returned it,"I was so disappointed. I thought this would have much more meat to it. If you know how to fold a fitted sheet, iron a blouse, or use lime-away on shower doors don't bother with this book. I was looking for different, helpful hints. Mom already told me to use lime-away. I have a book called something like ""Yankee Home Hints"" that is just filled with useful tips and hints on everything you could image. I guess I was hoping this book would be more like that."
3,Thorough... Perhaps TOO thorough?,"Called by one book reviewer ""Martha Stewart for the PhD crowd,"" Mendelson attacks the subject of household chores with a thoroughness and enthusiasm I find somewhat alarming.This book can be a helpful reference tool, but the author sometimes delves into excessive detail, that makes finding salient and truly helpful information difficult to locate. For example: having moved into a new apartment, I was curious to learn the correct way in which to best clean my wood floor. I had to skim almost 30 pages of a chapter entitled ""Floors and Furniture of Wood and Woodlike Materials"" before finding the answer."
5,if you live in a home you need this book,"I have been a stay at home ""homemaker"" for 10 years and I have always had a major struggle with how to be a good housekeeper.This book has completely changed my degree of competence in this area from pathetic to ""betty crocker like"". The author goes through each detail of all duties encountered in taking care of a home and describes how and why to do them. I really feel like an artist now that i have implemented tons of new stratagems in my daily upkeep of the home. She describes how important each job is in adding to the quality of life for ourselves and our families.Her description of how to wash white sheets caused me to quickly run out, buy white sheets, launder them and throw them on the bed (with hospital corners).After reading this book i now truly grasp what a privelage it is to have a home and to be able to care for it. Awesome!"
5,Thorough and well-written,"This is the best book I've found for how to keep house. In addition to being helpful, it's a good read. It's not just a long, dictionary-type list of how to remove stains as so many cleaning books seem to be. It talks about setting up routines, about the science behind cleaning products (so you will always know what to use when), how to fold laundry, and so much more. It is perfect for anyone who feels clueless about the very basics of homemaking."
2,Impractical for the average homemaker,"Like the author, I've always enjoyed reading about housekeeping, cleaning, and organizing. Unlike the author, I am not naturally tidy or organized. I thought this book would help me move past these shortcomings; sadly, it did not. It mostly succeeded in making me feel bad about myself in the same way that Martha Stewart can make me feel bad about myself. I will simply never have the time or energy to devote to constant drain and mattress maintenance, wall-washing, sheet-ironing, etc. If you are the sort of person who would actually enjoy performing these activities, then get this book. It is comprehensive and very well-written. What it is not is practical, unless you are very motivated about deep cleaning and extremely detail-oriented about every aspect of home care. For those of us willing to settle for clean enough, I highly recommendHouseworksinstead."
5,Second only to the Holy Bible,"If I had only two books in my house, this would be the other one. Seriously.Besides offering practical advice and -- shocking! -- a set of high standards for what ""clean"" and ""neat"" actually are, the book's style is simply a pleasure to read. Cheryl Mendelson's understated wit is enjoyable, with none of the snark that passes for cleverness these days."
5,OY! I Needed This book!,"My mother-in-law was a HOME EC major in college -- can you imagine? Needless to say, I was not. This book is full of practical advice to keep a home up and running, from day-to-day to annual home-keeping activities. Let's just see if i can keep this up for longer than a week!"
4,almost fantastic!,"I wish I had bought this 20 years ago. There is a lot of very basic stuff in here (how to was dishes) but also really helpful info about floor surfaces, fabrics etc.It is very thick and flimsy - I feel the publishers should have charged more and made this reference book sturdier and colour coded for quick reference, as it is I use it quite carefully instead of being able to whip it out in the middle of a cleaning session to get some elusive information.This is a great leaving home gift - the thing I got out of it at age 35 is to respect and honour the act of housekeeping - something never instilled in me in my youth growing up in a feminist family. I'm glad I have it."
3,"Useful, but not comprehensive","The most important thing to know about this book is that it is not a comprehensive guide to homemaking, rather it contains topics in which the author is interested. The last 10 chapters are on legal issues, sometimes not very relevant to homemaking (the author is a lawyer). The book is short on information on the major systems of a home, such as electricity, heat, etc. Plumbing only rates a two-page chapter that basically says 'call a plumber'.There is an impressive amount of information on air quality, allergens, food safety and related topics. Almost enough to make a person really paranoid.I like the author's no-nonsense approach to cleaning. At first I thought it was crazy to get on hands and knees to wash a floor, but I tried it and realized how much ground-in dirt really was on my floor. It makes sense that you can see more dirt from 2 ft away than 5 ft."
1,Think twice before you buy this book!,"Buying this book was a big mistake. I was expecting a guide to more efficient and practical housekeeping, but instead I found a relentless paean to obsessive practices. If even a minority of the author's basic assumptions were true, I'd be dead by now. Sanitize your drains once a week! Give me a break! Change pillowcases twice a week! Have mercy! Disinfect your dish towels after every use! Oh, please! Haul your mattress outside for sunning twice a year! Ouch! And did you know that garlic lasts only 2 days at room temperature? Please! I'm sorry, but you've got to be joking.Spare yourself another fruitless guilt trip...stay away from this book."
4,Very Comprehensive But...,"the index leaves a lot to be desired. There is a wealth of information here with a tremendous effort by the author to explain her recommendations. It's just fun to read, whether you think you're interested in the domestic arts or not. Since it is meant to be, among other things, a helpful reference manual, it is too bad the index isn't more robust. There are few cross-references and only a minimal attempt to include the many details mentioned in the text, so as it is now, you can't find them quickly again by using the index."
4,New Book for Wedding Gifts,This is my new gift for weddings. I started out buying it for myself and now I have purchased several as gifts for newly weds. It tells them everything from how to make a bed to getting stains out of clothes to cleaning different types of pots and pans. This is a great book for a new young person and the old one who sometimes need to look something up that they have forgot how to do.
4,"Not a Bible, just an encyclopedia","This book is an exhaustive (some might say ""exhausting"") reference for everything having to do with housecleaning and keeping. I read this book like crazy when I first got it and instituted some of the recommendations. I felt guilty about some of the stuff that I'm never, ever going to do. Then I forgot about it. Eventually, I hired a cleaning service. But I still think it's a great reference. You can use as much or as little of it as you want. Sure, she puts forth some personal lifestyle opinions, but if I wrote my own book I'd probably do the same. She's probably a Type A personality, but maybe that's what gave her the drive to write such a huge tome to begin with. If the book changes your life, great. If it just helps you buy some good sheets, there's nothing wrong with that either."
5,BUY IT!,"I am 30 years old and this book is like the bible of stuff my mother never taught me. I was a typical slovenly teenager that never learned to properly do anything around the house,much less clean. It just wasn't cool for moms to be homemakers in the 70's...who was i supposed to learn it from? This book is worth the money for the laundry section alone, it will save you time and money, even if you never read the other excellent and informative sections in the book. Everything is nicely laid out and easily referenced in an extensive index. Pet stains, laundry tips, how to iron, how to sew different stitches and when to use them, how to clean, how to disinfect surfaces, helping allergies, how to get grocery shopping done faster and better...the list goes on and on. This book is also helpful for new moms who suddenly find themselves suddenly worrying about general cleanliness and germs, etc. A good buy and well worth the money."
3,Very detailed .....gotta make time to read,"This is a good basic explanation of how to do everything around the house...a bit over the top in some areas as most people are looking for shortcuts these days....but this book will be used more as a reference guide, like a good old dictionary."
1,Thanks but no thanks,"This was one of the most tedious reads I have ever attempted-some of the content is practical but I died laughing when the author droned on and on about tasks such as hand dusting your floor. Keeping a comfortable home is one thing-practicality is another. I doubt that anyone who works a fourty hour work week, cooks meals and keeps a relatively clean house would have time to read this book, let alone adopt some of the practices. Check it out at your local library before buying to make sure its for you."
4,Great home maker guide,"lots of great information if you are interested in homemaking, and daily care of the home. I bought it on my kindle, but would love the actual book to mark it up and make notes."
5,What you wish your mom had taught you,"This book is like Martha Stewart combined with Better Housekeeping. Cheryl Mendelson covers every topic imaginable from setting a table and folding fitted sheets to how to bind a book. It's very thick for that very reason and it contains plenty of illustrations to clarify many subjects. I think it's an excellent shower or bridal gift (as long as they wouldn't be offended), especially this day in age, when so few have been taught the proper way to keep house. I would strongly recommend this book! Love it!"
1,Nothing not already on Google,"I was hoping that this book would help me run a cleaner, more efficient, more organized home, but it is just a dictionary-style book of information that is either dated, or already available for free if you Google them (for example, Googling ""how long before meat spoils?"" got me the same results as their chapter on food safety).For readers hoping for a manual on housekeeping, I recommend the (now out-of-print) books by Deniece Schofield:Confessions of an Organized Homemaker: The Secrets of Uncluttering Your Home and Taking Control of Your LifeKitchen Organization Tips and SecretsConfessions of a Happily Organized Family"
1,"I agree with the July 20,200 review","I had the same negative reaction to this book when I got it, but I thought I must be the only woman who felt that way. I can see that the book has struck a chord among women, but to me the chord was anything but harmonic. The title and content simply are not a match for one another, and I think people are buying the book because of the misleading ""Home Comforts"" title."
1,Wordy and hard to use,"I received Comforts Of Home as a shower gift, and I have found it to be very hard to use. It's so wordy and comes off as hard to read and hard to use textbook. Just try to find something quickly-----you can't. The information could have been boiled down into a much smaller book if it wasn't so wordy in the first place. I also don't know who this author is, so her credentials are questionable. I hate to sound like an ad, but I also received Making a Home (by the Better Homes and Gardens magazine staff) as a shower gift, and it's great. Really useful and comprehensive. I can find the info I want quickly, and the writing is concise and to the point. Making A Home is far better than Comforts Of Home, because I like the looseleaf binder style with its tabs (just like my favorite cookbook). I'm keeping Making a Home on the kitchen shelf by the phone book because I know I'll keep referring to it."
3,Too detailed for its own good,"I found this book to be detailed but not as helpful as other housekeeping books I've read. When I tried to find out how to deal with a stain, I was given a very detailed description of what causes a stain and how chemicals work to take it out, but I ran out of patience and looked in another book to find my answer. Another time I opened the book, just to read it and pass the time, when I came upon a detailed description of how to sweep. I dare say that if anyone is intelligent enough to comprehend and retain the information about stains, he/she probably knows how to sweep. I suppose this book can be motivating and helpful in some respects, but as a quick reference I haven't found it as good as others. I'm thinking about giving my copy away because it takes a lot of space on my shelf."
4,Don't follow information on page 443,"This VERY wordy book has some good basic information in it; but I would be careful with some of the ""recipes"" for Homemade Cleaners, specifically the Lime and Mineral Deposit Remover on p. 443. I tried this and ruined an expensive Franke faucet. The vinegar corroded the metal finish! So be careful. Vinegar works for these deposits but not when you literally soak the fixture in it for a long time."
4,Super Surf Sampler!,"Eddie Angel (The Planet Rockers, Los Straitjackets, The Neanderthals) runs his own label, Spinout Records, and among their output are some of the coolest comps you'll find anywhere. These tend to feature songs available elsewhere, but that doesn't take away from the good taste he shows when putting them together. On this one the bands include The Fathoms, The Insect Surfers, The Tiki Tones, Sir Bald Diddley, The Omega Men (""Sack O'Woe"", one of their BEST tracks), Jon & The Nightriders, The Space Cossacks, The Untamed Youth, The Huntington Cads, Satan's Pilgrims, The Halibuts, and The Boss Martians (""More Booze, Less Ice"", from the INTOXICATING SOUNDS... EP). This is my favorite of the 3 comps in this series so far! If you know or like ANY of these bands, check this out-- you MAY find yourself going after many of the others."
4,Part of 3 CDs in 1,"As an avid fan I still bought this cd without getting any idea of what was on it. The cd is really just songs from 3 different cds TJT already released (Understand This is a Dream, Emotion is Dead, and Music From Another Room). If you own all 3 cds already it may not be worth the money to you especially since there are no new songs on it."
5,very interesting.....not for the judgmental,"This was a bit kinky, but nothing outrageous. It was an interesting film about 2 teen age girls who are best friends and who go to a private Catholic school and get involved in ""black arts"". They act out many of their fantasies which have the expected results for the audience, although the naive girls seemed to be somewhat surprised at them. The ending is amazing and totally unexpected. This is a film worth seeing, although not for prudes or the overly judgmental."
3,Different,"This was something that was definately different. It was supposed to be based on an actual incident in Australia. It is probably more suitable for a rental rather than purchase, but it is rewatchable after a period of time has elapsed. These two girls were definately not your average ""girls next door"". The transfer was good and of good quality. Over all, I was unsure of this, but it turned out to be a good watch. Whatver nudity is in it, is somewhat muted and brief. There will be some that will probably be disappointed because of that, but the director, did what he needed to do to get the point across without going to unnecessary extremes. If you want something that is offbeat, than this is the film. Charlie S."
3,A return to form,"Vanity/Nemesis was the first Celtic Frost album I bought a few years back. It's still one of my favorite metal albums. The songs are well written and the album has a good production. Not as experimental as their previous albums, but it still carries its load with songs like the manic Third from the Sun (Wine in my Hand) and the song Nemesis. The Frost got a lot of flak for their previous album Cold Lake, but I think most fans that didn't like that should like this. It's a return to form with heavier songs than Cold Lake. Tom G. Warrior is a great metal vocalist and his guttural sounds are classic. Recommended."
3,"A surprise for fans who thought it ended with ""Cold Lake""","While ""Vanity/Nemesis"" may be far from being Celtic Frost's best effort, it is surprisingly good, considering the fact that it followed the infamous ""Cold Lake"" album. There is some faster thrash-style material on this album, as well as the more groove-oriented stuff Celtic Frost was occasionally known for (think ""Procreation of the Wicked"" and ""Babylon Fell""). The songs are strong overall, with more emphasis on melody than the earlier albums. Unfortunately, Tom's vocals are not quite as strong on this one, and it brings the album down a bit. Overall, this album is really for the Celtic Frost completist, who already owns the classic earlier material, and wishes to complete his/her collection. Buy the old stuff first, and then give this hidden treasure a try!"
1,The once mighty Celtic Frost reduced to....THIS,"Celtic frost. The name alone sends shivers down the spine of fans of metal, thrash and death metal..But they went soft and weird with Into the Pandemonium. Then they went glam rock with Cold Lake, a horribly misguided effort. Then they regrouped to put out this terrible collection of cheesy and weak ""metal"" offerings. Listening to this makes me sick because I know what Frost was capable of (Emperor's Return, To Mega Therion). So there is no excuse for this pile of putrid vomit."
1,NOOOOO,"I know I'm almost 20 years late in saying this, but about a week ago, I went through my uncle's old LP collection and found this. After listening to about 3-4 songs, I had to put this away. THIS IS AWFUL! This is a slightly heavier Bon Jovi. The only positive thing about this is atleast its not as bad as Cold Lake is. THAT IS 100% GARBAGE.But in the end, all is good, as Celtic Frost released one hell of an album, the epic Monotheist, which I recommend tenfold over this."
3,Its okay........,"Theyre better than Pantera but thats really not saying much.While Pantera just screams and screeches, Celtic Frost grunts and growls. And lets face it, grunting and growling is more enjoyable to listen to than screaming and screeching. At least it is to me."
3,Bien,"Producto recomendado, cumplieron con la entrega a tiempo, excelente calidad. Fue empacado correctamente y de manera conveniente para el viaje."
1,"A fairly boring book, BUT",To be interested in this book you must be a real student of Las Vegas history of the Fifties. Her story is not particularly interesting. I put BUT in the title because near the end of the book is a story of no more than a few paragraphs that is worthy of a movie. It's one of the best Las Vegas stories I've ever come across and I've heard and read a lot.
3,It didn't just start with the Oprah Book Club,"Even if you aren't familiar with the subject you should be able to spotall the inconsistancies and lapses in logic in this book.(not to mentionthe complete fabrications) Dave Berman was the bootlegging czar of Iowa,Was given Minneapolis a reward for keeping his mouth shut etc, yet he also robbed banks ""to put food on the table"". He never went to Minneapolisuntil after he got out of Sing Sing, yet he was also wanted for robbing a post office with 2 guys from St. Paul. He single handedly ran off Al Capone at a time when Capone was in prison. This stuff goes on endlessly.Look; Dave was a rival of the ""Minneapolis Combination"" run by Isadore ""Kid Cann"" Blumenfeld. Dave and his brother ran gambling joints in this area then moved to Vegas to invest in the Flamingo after Hubert Humphrey closed down the after Hubert Humphrey closed down thereir businesses. It was in Vegas that Dave becomes a big Wheel.The truth should have been colorful enough."
3,Hell no,I thought most of this was good. What they did to Moncada though? PLEASE. He would've thrashed Lucita and Fatima. What a serious let down. It should have been no contest. Thumbs down.
5,Exciting!,"It's a cool novel! Exciting, thrilling, amazing! You accompany Fatima al-Faqadi to Alamut, where you get an insight in the structure and inner politics of the Eagle's Nest. You visit a Sabbat invasion in the USA and a showdown with the Lasombra Archbishop of Lisbon. You learn details about some of Fatima's Rafiq colleagues as well as about Clan Elders like Jamal, Ur-Shulgi, Thetmes and Al-Ashrad. Maybe the best VtM book I have read."
5,awesometime,"cant remember if there is 12 or 13 original books in this series, but wow. blows every vampire movie and show right out of the water."
2,Not worth your money,"Badly written. Characters feel indistinct and are uninteresting. There doesn't seem to be a purpose to the story, and the whole novel lacks a purpose. I quit a little more than half way through."
3,Best of the series so far.,"Still, I'm not overly impressed. I did like the character of Fatima; I think she may be the most sympathetic character we've seen so far. It was a nice change for there to actually be a main character that it was possible to root for."
3,"Works, but not very loud","The MP3 player works great, and it's easy to copy music onto it. It's definitely waterproof, and I've used it swimming. However, the waterproof headphones just don't crank out enough sound. I'm not sure if I'm not inserting them correctly, or what, but at our indoor pool facility the volume just doesn't go up loud enough.So if you are planning on using them in a noisy pool, or you need loud volume, this isn't so great. For other activities though, with non-waterproof headphones, it's great."
1,Poor quality,Earbuds died after 2 times. Very disappointed. I would highly not recommend it !!!!I must admit the MP3 itself still works but this is useless to me as i needed something to swim with.
4,The studio did it.,"This is one of Hitchcock's best, not because of what you see on the screen, but because of what he intended you to see. The ending of this movie is not his; don't blame him because it is abrupt or pat. Watch this movie for what it was: a thriller that defied conventions of stardom and played with the leading man image, not the comfortably safe mess the studio made of it when Hitchcock went back to England. This is my favorite Hitchcock movie because of what it was supposed to be. Please keep the studio's butchering in mind when you watch it and think only of Hitchcock's wonderful finale that we will never get to see."
5,High Definition in Black and White,"Strangers on a Train, Wrong Man and I confess are worth the 5 star rating. Suspicion is very similar to most of the movies that Cary Grant was cast in Hitcock's movies. Good but not the same quality as the other three movies mentioned above. A very good buy and a wonderful time for those loving the black and white movies of long ago."
2,Why Did Fontaine Win An Oscar For This?,"Without any doubt in my mind definitely one of Hitchcock's lesser efforts. It's a very slow paced suspsense thriller,which lacks the wit and ""excitment"" of other Hitchcock films such as ""Rear Window"",""North by Northwest"",and ""The Birds"". I'm shocked to say very weak performances by two of hollywood's biggest stars(well,at one time anyway)Grant and Fontaine! And Hitchcock's directing isn't up to the usual hugh standard I expect from him. I really can't understand how other reviews can say so many good things about this film. I'm a big Hitchcock fan myself,but I chose to forget I every saw this film in the first place,and just remember Hitchcock for his several other great films. ONLY watch this if you want to see every single Hitchcock film ever made,or just bored. But stay away from this! Go watch ""Spellbound"",""Vertigo"",or ""The 39 Steps"" instead. Trust me,your better off!"
2,Dated and irritating,"Cary Grant as ""Johnnie"" and Joan Fontaine as ""Lina"" get married after knowing each other for what seems about 2 minutes. There is no sign of romance throughout the movie.Johnnie is fast-talking and witty - only to himself - and he calls Lina ""Monkeyface"" about 30 times too many - once was enough. He also calls his over-acting best-friend ""Beaky"", and ""Beaky"" refers to Johnnie as ""old bean"".Out-dated atmosphere where people ""change for dinner"", etc.Over the course of time, Lina has a ""suspicion"" that Johnnie has killed someone and plans to kill her, too. The ending seems tacked on, and makes a fool out of Lina, and us.Although it contains a few trademark Hitchcock elements, and was Oscar-nominated for Best Picture (and Joan Fontaine won for best actress), this is a dull, dreary bore."
1,Hitchcock at his worst,"I hope this review will warn others before they go out and buy this movie. Its slow-paced, unbelievable at the best of times and the end is so abrupt that I was left thinking ""is it over already?"". I'm a Hitchcock fan but I'd recommend others to give this a miss ( or just watch it on TV!). I don't inderstand the other reviewers who give this a 4 or 5 star rating. Did I miss something? I think not..."
2,A disappointing Hitchcock,"Although Fontaine and Grant are marvelous, and Hitchcock's direction is great as always, Suspicion suffers from a major script flaw. I don't want to give anything away, so I'll only say that the end felt like a major cop-out and, after I saw the feature with comments on the making on the film, and the changes made to the original screenplay, I can confirm that's exactly what it was. A shame, because this could have been an amazing movie."
5,Alfred Hitchcock DVD,I purchased this DVD as a secret santa gift and it was new and cleanly wrapped. It arrived on time and it was just what I ordered.
5,A Comedy Drama that really works,"Suspicion is a great movie for many different reasons. It's very suspenseful; Hitchcock's at top form. But in addition to the suspense it is also a great drama and surprisingly a great comedy as well. Sometimes you feel like you're watching three separate movies, but in a good way. You'll be laughing out loud at the comedy and then the next moment worried that a murder is about to take place. A must have for any Hitchcock fan.Jennifer K. LaffertyAuthor of Offbeat Love Stories and More"
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Suspicion is a very good movie that's utterly torpedoed by a horrible ending which not only leaves a bad taste in the mouth, but renders all the tension and events that had preceded the ending a series of implausible coincidences; blame who you want for the terrible denouement, but don't see this Hitchcock chiller unless you're prepared to be disappointed."
5,Bought this for an elderly friend living in rural Minnesota. Contained all the films she loved from her youth,"Quality was great and it is something someone can keep going back to for good entertainment. Those old classic films are like classic books, they don't go out of style."
4,Underrated gems,Very good price for 4 enjoyable films. The movies look great (dvd remasters) but are housed in a case that stacks each disc upon the next (my only complaint). The photo shows 2 flipper discs ----- but its wrong. It is actually 4 single discs with art work (nice!). Very much worth it!
5,alfred hitchcock Mystery collection,"An excelltent selection of four great movies for the Hitchcock lover! A definite must!!STrangers on A train is a classic, the Worng man another great with Henry Fonda and my personal Favorite is I confess with Monty Clift"
2,I just couldnt get into this,It started off well enough . . . the geeky beautiful girl who was tempted by a guy (I would say good looking but Grant appeared very tired and kinda aged in this movie even though he was also looking young [not so puffy of a face]) to awaken her quest to find a relationship. But then . . .well it just turned into a soap opera . . . the day time soap opera type of nonsense. And from that point I just spared myself the senseless emotional manipulation by turning it off.
3,Hitch Guru,"Suspecion is a great edition to add to your Hitchcock collection. This film has been great acclaimed for the use of its symbollic visual concept with shaply shadows and the penatrating use of lighting. Hithc never fails to show is creative side with the camera which can also highten the motivation for the audiance.Storyline wasnt increbibly gripping like Notorious, also starring Cary Grant, but it still deserves a great review.Kudos."
4,A great work companion,I am a fulltime Flash developer and this book is exactly what it says it is. Projects to get you started in the right direction. Beyond that I'm impressed by the architecture of each project. Mr. Kerman has made his templates as effortless to update as I imagine they could be.major kudos to this book. It's a fantasitic addition to an Flash users library.
2,Satisfactory,"The book is ok. It might not give you the ""punch"" that you need to open your eyes about Flash, but its fine for bigginers who want a hands on approach to learning."
1,Can't recommend,"I wouldn't say the book is ""totally useless"" but the decision the author made to serve up ActionScript without explanation because he thought we ""didn't want to get our hands dirty"" was a bad one. I see in his reply that he says he never claimed to do otherwise, but you don't realize this until you have read two chapters.I would prefer it if he had given us less projects but gone over the code in his .as files for us.Also, the author should understand that no one buys a book to get ready-made projects. We are buying these books to learn how to do these things on our own. If I just wanted a ready-made project I could just Google what I want and find one of the countless FLA examples people are good enough to share online. When I buy a book, its so I can learn to do it myself."
1,"Utterly useless, unless you're already an expert","Ya know the strange thing about the lessons in this book? They don't teach you anything, beyond how to take the lessons in this book.The author apparently suffers from the delusion that everyone understands actionscripting as much as he does. His ""introduction to actionscript"" dsoesn't really explain much, and is remarkable in its superficiality. The author then then plunges into a series of lessons that are long on script, but pretty much devoid of any explanation of what you're actually doing.If you like following pages of directions, and not actually LEARNING anything, this book is DEFINITELY for you. If you're looking for an educational resource that that will allow you to grasp actionscripting, and know how to customize it to your needs, look elsewhere, because this book just doesn't deliver."
1,Deceptive Title - Beware,"This book is definately NOT for beginners. The author assumes you are a veteran Flash designer (which I hope to become someday). I just wanted a step-by-step guide to show me how to animate an object, move it, fade it in and out and make it react like a button to trigger another event. That's all. Once I get that, the rest should come easily. Also, good luck if you own a Mac. The .swf file titled ""gathering_tool.swf"" contained on the accompanying CD will NOT play on my G5 - that's where the tutorial ended for me. There is no indication that the CD is strictly for PC. I can't believe there is a problem with this G5. It's brand new. Maybe I'm just trying too hard. I dunno.I'll go against my better judgement and try the Flash tutorial that came with the app. Then I might revisit this book down the road for reference - or sell it on Ebay!"
1,annoying,The stories ramble on like a drunk friend boring you to tears with long drawn out stories. Even his writing style is annoying. I couldn't read much of each story before I disliked it enough to put it down.
4,smokin,all of the first review is true but forgot to mention great covers of free's wishing well and thin lizzy's opium trail.the band does a great job!
4,Not Bad,"This book published in January 2006 by NASA as NASA Special Publication NASA SP-2006-4317 examines the history of one of the most powerful nuclear test reactors in the US and the only nuclear facility ever built by NASA, the Plum Brook Station near Sandusky, Ohio. When it became operational in 1963, this facility supported basic research for NASA's nuclear rocket program (NERVA). After only a decade of research, the government shut down the Plum Brook station before many of its experiments could be completed. Even the valiant attempt to use the reactor as an environmental analysis tool failed, and the facility was eventually closed. The reactors were unused for nearly 25 years at great cost to the taxpayers until the Nuclear Regulatory Commission decommissioned the reactors and cleaned up the site.As of May 2007, this book is still available from NASA for 27$"
2,It tried and failed,"Wow, they really tried with this movie to attain a certain feel. It didn't work.Buy Dick Tracy - that one worked."
3,Not as much fun as I thought it would be,"First, this movie is beautiful to watch. The way it was filmed is stunning and the special effects are amazing. The story itself harkens back to the days of the pulp science fiction novels and the old movie serials where the plots got more outlandish as the story went along. With all of this I was anxious to see the movie, but it ultimately disappoints. Some of the scenes are poorly set-up and the dialog is very bad at times. Gwyneth Paltrow is terrible as the female lead. This has more to do with the material than her abilities, but it's bad nonetheless. I found her character to be shrill and irritating and couldn't wait for her to be off the screen during her scenes. More time needed to be spent on the story and especially the interactions between characters. Special effects this good are one thing, but they can't make up for a script that is lacking."
4,Great Movie!,"If you want my opinion than just read scott15724's review. He nails it except I would not call the movie a metaphor for the 9-11 attack and/or the Afghan/ Iraq wars.This movie is pure escapism. A movie made today (with tongue in cheek of course) as it would have been made then.The only flaw is the end was a bit anti-climatic.I wasn't crazy about Gwyneth Paltrow being in the film, but she won me over. She stole the show from Law and does a better Lois Lane than Lois Lane. I don't like her real life politics but I do like her movie and her performance."
