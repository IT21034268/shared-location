4,"""Cool Water""","The C/D contained most of my favorite Sons Of The Pioneer's songs. However, I was disappointed that their signature song ""Cool Water"" was missing the last four lines or verse, i.e.The shadows sway and seem to say tonight we pray for water, cool water.And way up there He'll hear our prayer and show us where there's water, cool water.Dan's feet are sore he's yearning for just one thing more than water, cool water.Like me, I guess, he'd like to rest where there's no quest for water, cool water.This verse could have replaced ""Ridin Home"" 1:59."
5,Old West Songs,"For anyone interested in the wonderful nostalgic music of the 1930's into the 1940's, this album is for you. The whole album can be played without ever getting up to change the track number, because it all flows together in a genuine pleasing way. I don't want to even bother comparing it much of the overrated modern music you'll find nowadays. Let's just say your soul will be relaxed while listening to the duartion of the album. I think ""Cool Water"" was their biggest hit on this album, however they are many other great tracks such as ""Wind"", ""Wagon Wheels"", ""Blue Prairie"", and my favorate song ""Ghost Riders in The Sky"". When I think of old time America, when our culture was great and we were trucking along after the great depression, I think of this album!"
5,Cool Water,Great sound--brings back old memories in a smooth sound that is relaxing. I am going to look for more.
2,Rip off - only 8 songs,The music is great. The value is not. This CD is less that 30 minutes long! There are many other CDs collections of the Sons of the Pioneers that give you more for your money.
5,Cool Water,"There is no greater group then The Sons Of The Pioneers when it comes to singing great western music. It includes the classic Cool Water, Riders In he Sky, Tumbleweeds and on and on. Every song a gem. If you enjoy great classic western songs this should be in your collection"
5,"""Cool Water"" album is just too cool","Remembering the songs of the Sons Of The Pionees as a kid, I just had to have this album, come high water."
3,Disappointed,"I have the original LP of the Cool Water album.With great joy I saw the CD available and ordered it.My disappointment: MANY songs were omitted from the cd, songs like ""Maria"", etc.Why did they do that? There was room on the CD for ALL the songs. Grrrrrrrr"
1,Absolutely Horrible,"I should not have, and never will again, ordered music without a preview. This CD is an insult to anyone who thought they were getting an album with some orchestra music in the background to enhance the music, instead what you get is loud absurd sounds which are as loud as the lyrics and it makes it difficult to even hear the lyrics.Do not buy this CD if you expect it to sound like the great songs this group is known for as you won't even be able to hear the lyrics.Shame on you Amazon for selling such trash."
1,Wrong product,This album is incorrectly discribed. It only contains 8 songs. It is only the import version that contains 18 songs. This is wonderfull music performed by a very talented group of musician. I would only suggest buying the imported version.
3,OK,"This DVD is ok. I didn't like the music at first but now I'm used to it and it doesn't bother me anymore. The fake setting is still a bit annoying, the older ones were less distracting and more peaceful in my opinion. Workout is good."
3,Less Voiceover Please!!!,"I like the DVD itself, even if, as another reviewer says, they aren't all traditional poses. They are challenging and I appreciate the variations. As always, the Matrix is a valuable tool for allowing you to create your own workout. I wish more yogas and yoginis would offer it.I enjoy Ana and Ravi yoga, both pre and post blonde hair. I just wish they wouldn't talk so much! Just give us the pose please, then allow us the silence when doing it. For me, yoga is contemplative as I try to tone down my own inner dialogue. So their outer dialogue, their constant interjections, and unnecessary coaching throughout the DVD is really quite distracting and annoying to me.Maya Fiennes is a great example of a teacher who knows enough to explain the pose and then quit yapping. That is also true on a few, but not all, of Nirvair Singh Khalsa's DVDs."
4,Doable for Beginners!,"I have and love doing RaviAna's Fat Free Yoga DVD. When I first saw the poses in this new workout, I was a little intimidated, but once you actually try the poses, they're doable, even if you have to do the modified version (as I did for quite a few of them). My only hope is that your floor is somewhat soft, because some of my joints hurt doing this on my hardwood floor (and I'm in my twenties...)!My only gripe with this DVD is the scenery in the background is a little too fake for my eyes and is also distracting.However, Ana's smiling face is lovely as usual and the music is enjoyable (some of the tunes definitely borrowed from Bollywood, might I add!). I also like how they show side and front views of Ana as she does the poses for a better idea of how to position your body.The cardio aspect is not too strenuous (like you would get in an aerobics class at your local gym) but I did break a sweat and I definitely felt my muscles working."
2,Disappointing,"I don't know if it's me or the DVD but I'm definitely having a hard time getting into this one. The poses don't flow naturally for me and I don't enjoy the music. I LOVED Ravi and Ana's Solar Power, Transformer, and Meditation DVDs'; Body Electric and Boot Camp aren't giving the same immediate feelings of breakthrough. On the other hand, maybe they are making me work through some major negativity blocks. I will try them a couple more times, and if this changes I will update this review; otherwise I think I will put them to rest and go back to the older DVD's."
5,My New Addiction!,This DVD is the perfect yoga session for me. I also love the way that the first part (after warm-ups) entails holding poses with deep breathing. Great for strength building. Works all muscle groups. Then there is a great ab sequence and an ingenious cardio sequence done on your hands and knees. The music is amazing. I love the mantra which Ana sings. It stays in my head all day and keeps me in a good mood. There is so much amazing material on this new one. It's awesome!
1,"LIES, LIES, DECEPTION, DELUSIONS followed by more LIES!!!","I read this book seeking more insight on this most famous of espionage cases. What I obtained, instead, was the most deceitful pack of dishonest manure that I have ever read. And the lies were not even creative ones. Moscow doesn't even pretend that they were not guilty!!! How this book could have been written after the opening of the sealed FBI records, the release of the Venona transcripts, and their subsequent corroboration by the Soviet archives (which unanimously refute every one of Charmichael's inane points) is beyond comprehension. Or maybe the latest leftist strategy is designed to convince us that Stalin really was successful in purging anyone with a semblance of intelligence."
1,Boring for Non-Sociology Majors,"I have Jennifer Friedman as my professor this semester, and she talks just how she writes in her book. Very broad and not detailed. Book is choppy and does not follow a discrete pattern, like my Jennifer teaches in class."
4,Much better then the first,"I bought this volume first and really enjoyed it, it really opens your eyes to all the possiblities and you start to see your own layouts form, it shows you how to take formats from other magazine that now I flip through at the doctors office and get ideas from.A great thing to have with you when your scrapping for that last minute stumper."
5,Excellent source for page layouts!!!,I love all the various page layouts especially categorized by the number of pictures used for the layouts. I'm always looking for new ideas and this takes each layout and provides many alternatives. I also have the first volume and enjoy it just as much!
3,I don't want to go back to school shipment,"The book was great for second graders going back to school...just what I wanted.However, the book was damaged in shipment. I feel that the seller could have done better wrapping the book for shipment, which would have alleviated the problem. The seller didn't offer any reduction in price, replacement book, or any alternative when contacted. Too bad."
4,got to work it in,"fit s great like breaking in a baseball glove once its broke in you'll love it, its the breaking in part that bites"
4,Fills A Gap in the Titanic Literature,"The major emphasis of the book is the United States Senate investigation into the wreck of the R.M.S. Titanic and focuses on the efforts of Senator William Alden Smith (R-Mich.), who chaired the investigative subcommittee. The book describes the thoroughness and determination of Senator Smith as he conducted the investigation and goes to great lengths to demonstrate that the United States investigation was equal to or better than the one conducted in the United Kingdom.The major flaw in the book is its attempt to do double duty as a biography of Senator Smith. The book also contains minor factual errors that could have been weeded out by more careful proof-reading."
4,Good stuff here,I felt the book had an in depth look at the aftermath of the sinking and not the sinking itself. I had always heard this and that but to read it quoted for the transcripts of the inquiry is awesome. Great book.
3,The Glacier View Manuscript,"If you are up for reading all of the material on both sides of this debate, then buy this book. If, however, you are looking to skim it and try to score a few points in an argument, forget it. This is the (academic) book that came as a result of the author studying the subject matter and presenting it to a large group of acedemics from the SDA church. It is not a lightweight book, as it deals in minute detail with the subject of Daniel 8:14. Not for the faint hearted, but one for the serious scholar of the subject."
2,FIND THE ORIGINAL,"Editing continues to take Joel's original works and change them unnecessarily. Seek out the original works. This was originally a series of classes which stenographers recorded by hand, before tape recordings. The essence of Joel's consciousness is in the original words. Sinkler made publishers happy with her changes, but Joel always insisted that he just wanted punctuation and spelling corrections. Our proof is in the efficacy and staying power of the older works, while Sinklers later works have all but been ignored."
5,A MUST read for anyone interested in Spiritual Healing,"""The master Speaks"" by Joel S Goldsmith is, without doubt, the most powerful and effective book ever written concerning the Art of Spiritual Healing. Mr. Goldsmith's methods are not easy(nor are they particularly difficult). There is no mumbo-jumbo or New Age jargon involved that will magically turn you into a healer. Mr. Goldsmith had over forty years of documented healing experience(he passed, I believe, circa 1964; however I may be wrong). The main focus of his work is to know the differences between Psychological healing and True Spiritual healing. He works directly from the words of Jesus as recorded in the King James edition of the Holy Bible and stresses that the full recognition of ""The Father And I Are One"" is the key.I wholeheartedly recommend this volume, and other works by Joel S. Goldsmith, to the serious and non-self delusional seeker.EGP MARTELL"
5,The Master IS Speaking,"This book is an answer to a prayer for me.Thank you for making available a book that appears to be needed in ""this world""Dorothy Henry"
4,Only available recording of Harris Sym. No. 6,"This disc is a collection of recordings that were originally on the Varese Sarabande label back in 1980's. The performances by the Pacific Symphony Orchestra are great. If you haven't heard this orchestra before, this is a great place to start. This is the best recording of Barber's First Essay, and I have several recordings of that piece. This is the only recording of the Harris Symphony No. 6 and, though the sound is not quite as good here as it was on the old Varese Sarabande disc, this is still a mandatory disc for Harris fans and for anybody interested in this composer."
2,Do you know how Oliver Stone attracted people like Lewis?,"When Oliver Stone came to Dallas to film his movie about the JFK assassination, he ran a most peculiar advertisement to all readers of the Dallas Morning News. He asked that anyone who had any kind of story, no matter how ridiculous or far-fetched, call a certain phone number. Yes, that is exactly how serious he was and that is why his movie is filled with implications for exactly 16 agencies to have somehow conspired in the assassination of President Kennedy. Sixteen? And nobody has come forward yet to describe details of this vast conspiracy? If you want to know what really happened, read Oswald's words. The man wrote, interviewed, and told people what he thought. He loved to put his words on paper. Read ""Autobiography of Lee Harvey Oswald"" and ""The Mind of Oswald"" to see his words. Read ""Dallas and the Jack Ruby Trial"" to see why Ruby killed Oswald. Be a truth-seeker, not a gossip-monger."
2,Haven't we met in hell before?,Grim Reaper [was] so bad they are amusing. Kinda remind me of Spinal Tap. I still get a kick out of the title track. See you all in hell my friends! I got my eye on you.
3,Compilation cd.,"This is a compilation of songs from the three other Jon Anderson/Vangelis albums that had been recorded in the early 1980's. If you own those already, there isn't a need to get this one."
2,RE:Review,"Technical dataTotal capacity: 128 MBType: SDRAM moduleContents: 1 piece totaling a 128 MB upgradeCompatibility: Compaq Armada 7400, 7800; Compaq Presario 1255, 1260, 1266, 1267, and other compatible products may existTechnical support: (800) 845-8777, toll free, 24 hours a day, 7 days a weekRemember this is for Laptops"
1,I am very dissatisfied,"I purchased Viking C78128 128 MB SDRAM DIMM Memory for Compaq Products, and when I installed it on my Compaq Presario 1255, it did not work. The memory fit perfectly, but Windows 98 did not recognize it. When I asked for technical help from Viking, I received an email saying that they would get back to me in 24 hours. That was five days ago, and I still have not heard back from them. Let my experience be a warning to future buyers. The sellers of my memory from this website have not stood behind their product, and I am out the money that I paid. I have ordered many products from the Internet in the past, though not through this website, and I have never had service that was this poor."
2,"Same story, different names","Lets write a book and include a omnipotent blue gem, a High'n Mighty sorceress, a male main character with too many bad habits, a child who doesn't speak (but needs a spanking)... lets throw in some gods and lets make it a quest. Of course, nobody can ever solve their problems HERE. They gotta go to the other side of the planet.Oh wait. Eddings already wrote this story. Its called the Belgariad. Oh, and the Mallorean, there was an original.Ok sarcasm aside... the series did introduce a new ""world"" to Eddings' fans, but unfortunately his characters were so predictably like his old that I was getting a profound sense of deja vu.Sephrenia = Polgara (in all but appearances)Sparhawk = Belgarion/BelgarathFlute = ErrandBelliom = Orb of Aldur (yes, identical even to the blue color).C'mon Mr & Mrs Eddings. Use some imagination."
3,As Good As The Rest? Maybe,"Although i like Eddings, and the plot lines are interesting, and the characters very believable and even more rarely, not down right irritating, i don't particularly like reading (more or less) the same storyline, and hearing about the same characters, i mean who does Sephrenia remind you of?So although i enjoyed it, i always had a sense of deja vu whilst reading it. I also found that Edding's need to pair everybody up a bit strange, and it could readlike a bit of a soap opera. This comes out more a bit later, and especially in The Tamuli.So although no where near as good as The Belgariad, it is still entertaining and well realized, with a good set of characters and a new world that is easy to get into. So quite good, though not particularly memorable."
4,A good start for the Elenium series!,"As always at the beginning of a longer series, you need time to get to know protagonists and settings. If you take this time, however, you will soon fall in love with Eddings witty style and dialogues. Eddings is the perfect author for anybody who likes traditional fantasy."
3,"Slow start, but enthralling towards the end.",I started to read the book but found it hard to get past the first chapter. It was easy to give up but I decided to struggle on and found it hard to put down. The characters were believable and the story fantastic and when i finished I went straight out to buy the other books. A wonderful book for fans of the Belgariad.
2,Boring,"A rehash of characters in previous books. It seems almost everyone has the same ""wry"" sense of humor, or sarcasm. I got the second book, only because I felt obligated to finish the story. If its no better, I won't bother with the third."
2,For Audiobook Listeners,"I suggest that you pass on the audible download and try the written book itself.I enjoyed both the Belgariad and Mallorean series, but the reader of the first book of Elenium uses a method that detracts from the story. Usually professional audiobook readers add to a novel, by the way they interpret the character voices and do vocal adjustments that heighten the mood and keep you enthralled while the story progresses.The reader of the Elenium series uses p-r-e-c-i-s-e enunciation, provides no realistic vocal adjustments to help you keep the characters separate, and has vocal mannerisms that keep intruding into the story. I've listened to many, many audiobooks and like in every other profession, some readers are masters while others fall into the range of good through gosh awful.I'm on the first book of Elenium and it's a chore to keep listening. I might just try reading the book, as I can't really make a fair assessment of the novel itself on the audible version."
3,"Same story, different venue","I had rather mixed feelings after reading this first novel of Edding's new series. While it was very detailed and paid a great deal of attention to character development, it seemed to be a repetition of characters from his previous novels.Sir Sparhawk is almost a direct equivalent of an adult Belgarion, Sepherenia is Polgara, Silk is talen, etc etc etc. His men and women act just like they did in the Belgarion/Malloreon.Similarly, the story follows the same flow as did the adventures of the Belgariad/Malloreon. They start in the calm, sedate west and wind up with an Emperor in the east.The books were worth a quick read. If I hadn't read eddings' previous 10 novels (The belgariad / malloreon) I might have enjoyed them more."
4,Very readable epic fantasy,"This was the first of Eddings' books that I have read so I compare it with other epic fantasy I am familiar with (Tolkien, Lawhead and Jordan, among others). In contrast to Jordan, whose characters seem to be acted upon rather than witting actors themselves, Eddings' Sparhawk, like his other characters, is a complete protagonist whose actions make sense and whose motivations are clear. Eddings' writing makes for highly enjoyable reading and obviously comes from a person versed in mythology and medievalism. Not a competitor for Tolkien but definitely Recommended."
5,great read,"i think this is really a great book. I'm not a new reader to David Eddings, in fact, i read the whole Belgariad and Mallorean twice, plus the companion novels. I don't think that this is as good as those, but then again, I've only read this book. It's great, though, and I would recommend reading it any day."
2,a disappionting bore,"As an avid reader of fantasy I must say I was very disappointed by this book. The characters are pathetically shallow and the dialogue is extremely trite. You could read the first and last chapters, skip the middle and not miss a thing."
3,First in an Interesting Series,"I pulled this book off of my BF's shelf out of curiosity. And I'm sorta glad I did.As one reviewer mentioned before, the format is fairly traditional--brave knight must rescue damsel in distress while battling to save the world. That leaves the characters and plot somewhat one-dimensional. You KNOW how the story is going to eventually turn out--good triumphs and hero beds heroine, as Roger Zelazny once put it.The fun in this book and series is the journey itself. I won't say there were any plot twists, but the book moved along at a nice pace. Lots of action, fairly believable dialogue.I'd reccomend this book and series as a light read, perhaps something for the beach or a rainy day."
2,Nothing new here....,"Although David Eddings has written some great books, this trilogy is definitely not among them.I am more than a little disappointed with David Eddings. It seems to me that after developing a certain style for instance in the Belgariad series, he is now trying to sell the same story again, and again, and again... All who has read a number of fantasy books (and especially Eddings') are familiar with the plot here. A great evil god is threatening the world, and a great warrior, a thief, some magic deity or other gathers together to thwart the evil plans. I recognised a lot of the Belgariad in this trilogy, and I think its about time David Eddings came up with something new.By all means, if you loved the Belgariad, and don't mind reading something wery similar, you probably will enjoy this. But if you're looking for a creative addition to the fantasy genre, you're gonna be disappointed."
2,Edding's Diamond Throne alltogether uninspiring,"David Eddings, you've disappointed. The Diamond Throne has all the feel of an author pounding out a book just for the sake of pounding out a book. It's slow-moving, more than a hair cliche, and just plain dull.But the worst thing about The Diamond Throne is its selfish ending. Anyone who suffers through this drab plot deserves a conclusion. It's one thing to write a trilogy. But each book should be a book. Each book should have a beginning, a middle, and an end. Eddings gives us a beginning and way too much middle. Nothing close to an end though.Undriven and lacking imagination. Don't bother with this one."
1,Trite and banal,"This book was a major disappointment. The characters lack depth and the plot is very simplistic and rather disjoint. For example, the major character just happens to overhear the villians detail a neferious plot. Not at all comperable to the BelGariad series(which was excellent). I gave up reading after suffering thru most of this book. The characters are excellent but there is little character development. And the so called plot is extremely childish. This book is more suitable for a 13-14 year old.If your a big fan of the Eddings, then get this series thru the library. If definitely isn't worth you bookshelf space."
1,This is why u do not begin a new series while writing anothe,"There was absolutely no point in even writing this book. The reader gains no information except that the queens sick and who the characters are, which could easily be dealt with as a backgroud in another book. The one star I gave it goes to the exceptional prologue, which is the only thing that did not make me throw the book. Pointless, absolutely pointless. Over 400 pages of pointlessness."
4,Gorgeous,"Not just the women themselves, but the renderings of them. This collection offers many view of what a woman is: young, in her prime, or aging; clothed or nude; even carrying new life within her. These hard-edged black and white images carry the soft curves of well- and un-known women beautifully.My only reservation comes from some of the pictures of children.Jock Sturges'sphotos of naturist families show people of every age, happy and at ease in their undress. Mapplethorpe's unclad children distinctly lack that sense of ease - even small children know what they are comfortable with and, in at least a few cases, their comfort seems not to have been taken into account.Except for that one troubling note, I find this one of the most captivating collections of figure and portrait photography I've seen.- wiredwierd"
5,Buyer,"CD Player that was originally sent was incorrect. Upon notification to seller, we received an immediate response of apology and a new one was sent within a few days.Great service!"
1,"Run, do not walk, away from this device.","Sony, the greedy bastards that brought you Betamax, are back at it again with this digital music player. IT IS NOT AN MP3 PLAYER. It converts all mp3 files into a proprietary code that makes using the files for anything other than this player impossible. Unless you want to have two versions of every song on your hard drive, one for Sony and one for everything else, do yourself a favor and buy a real mp3 device."
1,"""Open"" equals ""closed""","All you need to know about this device is that its manufacturer, Sony, is a music publisher.So they created this device to protect themselves and lock us out of having unfettered access to OUR music that we purchased in CD form.Their software and memory stick technology use the term ""open"" to describe the accessibility of your music, but it's really closed, or at least limited.It works like this: you copy your CDs onto your harddrive. Then, you ""check out"" songs from the harddrive to your memory stick, much like you check a book out of a library. At that point you can only listen to the song from the stick, or your CD. It will be unavailable on your harddrive until you check it back in -- just like at the library. There are also limits to the number of times/or amount of time you can ""check out"" music (I can't remember which -- that's when I gave up and returned the thing.)"
2,"Great Size, Terrible Software","I reject Sony's policy of trying to make everyone use their proprietary format. Yes, you can use MP3 and WMA, but it converts it to Sony's encrypted format. As if they are the MP3 police, you can only download and upload the music several times before it cuts you off. I own this music! I can do as i want with it."
3,Great but has drawbacks,"I love it, it small, lightweight and just plain good looking. Sound quality is also really good. However the major drawback is sony's method of copy right. You will find out when you buy it if you use your own cd's a lot. If you like just plain old mp3 it is great but if you want to use your own mp3 dont buy it."
5,Wonderful!!!,"This CD is one of our favorites!Maria Sangiolo has a beautiful voice and the various rhythms of the songs on the CD make it captivating, wonderful to dance to and sing along!A definite MUST HAVE in a children's music collection!"
2,The quality is lacking,"They put all of the movies on one disc. So as you can an imagine the picture quality is not very good. Midnight Movie gets 3 stars out of 5 it is not to bad if you can get passed some bad acting, Carver is the rated R cut version so it gets 2 of 5. Have not watched The Attic or Outrage yet, but will update when I do"
5,Tummy troubles,"This can be hard to locate in my local stores. I have used this with my 10 month old nearly since he was born. Even with me watching my diet, he tended to get gassy while on breast milk. The chamomile has a soothing effect & he usually drifts off to sleep after a dose. I love it & chose it because it is natural. Too many gas drops are synthetic, which I don't trust. It doesn't really have a flavor & was no trouble to add to his bottles."
2,Life Story,"I bought this book because I am considering writing my autobiography. I found it to be somewhat helpful. There were too many outdated stories from 100 years ago. If you remove the stories the book is a quarter of the size. It did teach me that it's not that difficult to write your own story. The author was right that once you start writing, memories will come back to you.Overall I would not recommend this book. I'm going to do it on my own."
2,Not impressed,Not impressed...mostly common sense not enough information for the price....How to Write Your Own Life Story: The Classic Guide for the...Lois Daniel
2,Not Good,Not beneficial in the least. Nothing in here but common sense. We've already seen this type of advice in countless other books. I can't recommend this book.
3,size 9,"Hi, I don't know why if in this model my size is 9, because I have an old pair, This one fit me a little bit tight. And I don't know if I Can get another pair, but 9 1/2 with the same price.Otherwise I don't know yet how confortable are in the field, besides is a nice modelThanks a lot"
1,Not what it seems.,"This is really a collection of 1950's movie clips that were probably in the public domain (military) even when they were first made. They are out of date, out of style and extremely expensive for what they are.Just because they were made a long time ago doesn't make them classics.Look for something else."
4,Dadgum your soul,"This is a fine collection of songs by country brother acts from the 1930s. Practically all of the acts feature just two brothers playing and singing together (the exception is the Lone Star Cowboys, who have a third guy playing guitar). The CD feature three songs each by six different teams. Many of the songs here are classics that became better known when covered by later performers. The best known act here would be the Monroe Brothers, featuring Bill Monroe, the Father of Bluegrass. There is a lot of good music here. Fans of old time country music should really enjoy it."
5,Two great movies for the price of one!,"Both these movies are classics! Each time you watch them, you pick up on more of the demented humor in them...right up my alley!! Great fun!"
4,Fun Movies,The Addams Family is one of the great oldies from tv. The movies a fun to watch and all family members could sit and have a good laugh. This is when tv and movies were good.
5,raul julia,"raul julia made a great villan in street fighter (General Bison) -- great movie addams family , im too young to remember the original tv show but this is a great movie non the less"
3,it is great movie,to bad raul jula will not be remebered for this movie which in my opinon was his best works for me
4,Absolute Fun !,"Two of my favourite movies on one disc ? This is a great set. It's been said that the Addams family movies are darker than the tv series. That's because the movies are based more on the comics than the movies. You'd think that having two movies on one disc would make the quality really horrible. It doesn't. Both movies were single layer transfers, so there's no compression. The picture is clear and free of artifacts....for the most part. The only time anything is noticeable is during the very beginning of the movies when the picture is really dark. Both movies have trailers which are a lot of fun. If you're a fan of the Addams family, then you should get this dvd. And contrary to a previous review, both movies ARE in widescreen."
5,Two VERY Funny Movies,"I will miss Raul Jullia. I would have loved to see this series continue. Sad, but we still have two of the funniest movies ever made"
2,The Addam's,Okay film. Something silly to watch with the family and compare your dad and mother to the characters in the film.
3,???????????????,the adams family is all right but the adams family values is lame painful to watch and not suitible for children
1,Wrong area code,This dvd is useless for me: it does not play on my player in Europe. I wont buy like this again.
4,love the Adams! :),"Great value pack, only complaint is they only come in English with English subtitles. I like when they come in different languages.. I understand and speak English very well but my husband doesn't so it would have been great to be able to enjoy it with him. Anyhow he's trying hard, but I think Amazon should open up and start selling DVD's that are more complete on this subject. Actually being only in English (audio) wasn't the problem but the subtitles only come in English so it's almost same as if they had come with Close Caption.. :(Otherwise totally recommended if you love the Addams! :)"
4,Very strong and fold on go easy type table,"For the laptop and the monitor setup i have, this is the best table i could get. I love it. Its very strong and its easy to move, fold and go."
3,Fun to play with........once!,"Cute, but my child can't do much with it. She followed it around while Elmo sang and did the limbo a couple of times, after that, it was put in the closet. Cute but not for long."
1,9.98 for a reason,You get what you pay for in this case. My daughter was given this as a gift a year ago and it has been a dust collector ever since. She hates this ELMO because is falls over. He should be called clumsy ELMO. My daughter has the Hokey Pokey ELMO too and that is a 10+.
3,"I agree, I love it, but it does not hold my child's interest","I love the tune, and so do our friends (without children) who visit and like to play with Elmo. However, it does not hold the attention of my 15-month-old son at all, unfortunately."
2,Fall over Elmo is a better name,"The instructions say to put Elmo on a hard floor to ensure it works, but that doesn't make much of a difference. It falls over and the music doesn't last long enough. I liked the Rock'n Roll Elmo best because he had a guitar and played music while rockin'. That was more entertaining for this age group. This is more frustrating -- even me, a grown up, is frustrated with this toy. The limbo stick can get lost easily in the piles of toys not attached to anything. Too much effort between Elmo and the stick. Chicken Dance or Hokey Pokey Elmo look like better choices, but I have not tried them."
4,my one year old tiwn boys love him!,"My one year old twin boys love him- but only for about a minute. he sings the limbo song, and then they go over and knock him down, because when you do, Elmo says, ""OOPS!! elmo limbo'ed too far- can you help him up please?"" and then when you pick him up, he says, ""THANK YOU!!"" Too cute! the limbo stick is useless, but they now know who elmo is and when he comes on the tv screen, they go nuts! Plus, he teaches them that when you help someone, you say thank you.very cute toy. I would buy chicken dance elmo if it's as cute. All that really matters is that he makes my boys laugh."
4,Nurse Tessa finds a family.....,"Blurb:When Nurse Tessa Calvert helps a troubled woman on her radio advice show, she unwittingly lands herself in a fix. For the ""woman"" is the rebellious young daughter of her new boss, A&E consultant James Armstrong -- who is furious with Tessa for her inadvertently inappropriate advice!Despite their explosive beginning, James and Tessa both feel the powerful attraction between them. Soon James wants her permanently in his life -- but first he must discover why such a loving, caring woman is so very afraid of commitment....I enjoyed how this couple talked, no big misunderstandings."
2,I'm torn,"On the one hand, this book is an undisputed page turner, and I couldn't wait to finish it. On the other hand, I didn't like the characters. I can't honestly say that I liked this book, but Dickey does a good job of developing his characters. My problem with this book is that these women are a little too over the top. Even meek and mild Valerie somehow morphs into a character you might expect to see on The Jerry Springer Show.The 3 perspective scheme of this book (Valerie, Chiquita, Inda) didn't work for me at all. I also had a hard time accepting the relationship between Inda and Chiquita.I think the book overall could have used more depth. By trying to detail the lives of all three women, I don't think the writer did justice to any of them. This is a promising first effort though, and I'd be willing to read another of Dickey's books."
5,Warning. . . This Book Is Addictive,"* * * * * 5 Star rating""ERIC JEROME DICKEY is an incredible writer."" His book, Sister, Sister held me captive for 6 hours one Sunday and I must say when he set me free with his words, I actually missed it. The book deals with a number of topical issues but it is not didactic nor is it preachey. In fact, he spins a very funny and unpredictable story set in sunny California. As an aspiring author I must warn you, if you like books that are not written with emotion or books that are not topical or books that do not make you think or books that are predictable, DO NOT READ THIS ONE, because it is addictive. But if you enjoy a book that will take you to another world, one in which you are sure to miss after reading the last page, you will undoubtedly enjoy. . . Sister, Sister."
2,"Valerie, Inda, & Chiquita","Inda-Linda without the ""L"" is Valerie's Sister. Inda & Chiquita became friends when they found out they were f**kin' the same man. Valerie is having marriage problems. I read Cheaters before I read this book. I was disappointed."
5,I forgot how GREAT this book was,"I just finished re-reading Sister Sister. This was such a great book, I did not want it to end. I read it when it first came out, and I will definitely read it again. This is one of EJD's best books. I have read all of his books, and have never been disappointed. I wish I could have given it more stars. If you haven't read it, go get it today. You will not regret it. EJD when is the next one coming out? Peace!!"
5,This Man Can Tell A Story!!!,"I just re-read Sister, Sister for my Book Club and this book is awesome!!! The characters are so real that everyone, male or female, can relate to them. I feel like I know these women, or at the very least I know women just like them.I have loved everthing this man has written and I will look forward to all of his future endeavors."
5,You'll never put the book down until the end!,Mr. Dickey Greetings... I just bought your latest book. I'm sure I will enjoy it as I have your previous two hits. I have passed your books along to co-workers and relatives. I let one of my co-workers read your first book and she kept it needless to say I bought it again and left it with a more reliable source my mother. Keep up the great flow of words you are truly great!Favorite line: You're crazy he said.
4,This reading was very delightful.,"It's good to see a black male in touch with his feminine side. A brother who understand women, their feelings, desires & needs. All black men should read romance novels as well as sports/entertainment mazagines. The real truth comes from within. Congratulations on a very good summary of love."
1,Boring!!!!!!!!!!!!,What a waste of time. I thought that this book was going to be good. It had its good parts but turned out to be a flop. Im sorry Jerome I only finished the book because I paid for it.
1,"Silly, Silly, Silly","This book started off OK, but took a turn for the worse and got very silly and unrealistic when one of the female characters climbs a building to get on a balcony, goes into the already opened balcony door, pulls out her gun, and catches her husband with another woman. Then with the gun still out, she asks for something to eat. She then just leaves the apartment while eating.Some people think this is funny, but I think it is plain silly and a waste of my time!"
3,Bad brothers!,Valerie and Inda are sisters. The products of a mixed coupled relationship. Valerie is fare skinned. Attributes taken from her white mother. She's married and miserable in a six year marriage to Walter. A black man who blames his lack of success on Valerie and what he feels is her lack of motivation. Inda takes her dark features from their father. She was once married to a white male and vowed to never let a man dictate the way she lives her carefree life ever again after finding out he cheated.These two women are taken on a journey of soul searching and a new relationship with Chiquita whose just like a sister after some circumstances force them into each others lives. OK read.
4,Thoroughly enjoyed it.,"Very entertaining story. I thought the characters were well developed and the story flowed to me. Decent plot. Funny, easy, and light. Loved the different points of views used for different characters. Read like it came from inside a woman's head. For me, it was an engaging pageturner."
4,it's a good read,"I really liked this book. It showed the ups and downs of three women and their relationships to one another, friends, and family. When Valerie finally stood up to her man I was proud of her even though she went a little psycho for a second there. Um but I kinda lost her after that. I couldnt' really understand what kind of relationship she had with Daniel. Inda, I really liked her. She reminded me of so many women I know. Chiquita was cool. She pissed me off for a second but she was back right after a while. Over all it was a great read. And for once EJD didn't give you detail after detail about the interworkings of the LA highway system. Thanks EJD. I really appreciated that!"
4,"Sister, Sister - Real Women",I thought the book was enjoyable but it wasn't quite as gripping as I tend to like a good book to be when I'm reading. I need it to hold my interest. The girl's reactions to some of the things that occurred were not always ideal but there was realism overall when things went down. The story did have me laughing in parts but I thought the story fell sort of flat for the ending. I give four stars because it's still worth the read for EJD fans.
4,"An Entertaining, Touching, Tale of Life and Loves","I found Sister, Sister to be entertaining. The personal dialogue was real, although sometimes hard to follow. I was touched by the family relationships, especially between Chiquita and her estranged mom (it made me cry). Also, the bond that formed between Inda and Chiquita, that's a real thing (been there, done that). Only wish there was more genuine spirituality in the characters, not just going to church and singing. It was headed in the right direction though just needs more character depth. Finished it in two days. Moving on to Friends and Lovers. Dickey may be my next favorite author, the kind where you buy the book because of who wrote it not necessarily because of the content. God Bless and much success to him."
4,Sister Sister!,Eric does a good job of entertaining readers with plenty of humor and a touch of drama. I've read some of his other books and this is my favorite by far.
5,Great! A dose of reality.,Once I started this book I could not put it down. Every page was as exciting as the first. The characters were truly believable because stuff like that happens every day. I recommend this to girlfriends everywhere!
3,"Cute decal, Light Scent","The air freshner arrived today and its adorable, just as the photo denotes. The solid part is 4 inches in length and has a nice blue nylon chord to hang from. Is marked as being made in 2003. Only thing is that the actual fragrance on the item is very light. This is probably due to being manufactured two years earlier. The scent that does come through though is rather sweet smelling and nice. Would recommend to those that like the Sesame Street character Grover more than someone who is looking specifically for an air freshner to fragrance a room or large sized truck or van."
2,"Boring, Bland, and ""Out There""","I am a huge Robards fan, but I was extremely disappointed in this book (as well as Midnight Hour). The main reason that I find Robards books to be so intriguing is the chemistry and love hate relationships that develop between the two main characters. And Ghost Moon is simply not it. The entire novel seems to just go on and on without ever really going anywhere. The supernatural usage is getting old. The ""Bad Guy"" is just TOO bad. It seems as though Robards is just trying to incorporate too many ideas into one book and it just doesn't work. What a sheer disappointment..."
4,Ghost Moon,This was my first book by this author.There was a lot to like about this book.I enjoyed the short chapters.I thought the author should have spent less time on what the characters were wearing and the men are ALWAYS wearing khaki or red white and blue in some sort of combination!There are alot of unesscesary characters at times and reference's to them that leave you feeling a little lost at times. Otherwise this is an easy read and a pretty good story.
4,A Keeper,"This book was packed with suspense and plenty of it. The romance between the two characters sizzled. Olivia goes home after leaving nine years before. She had a heated battle with her cousin and her Uncle about leaving home to elope with a roaming cowboy. She and her daughter are invited by her ""Aunt Callie"". ""Aunt Callie"" has cancer and wants to get her unfinished business in order. Seth, Olivia's ""cousin"" by marriage and Olivia have strong feelings for one another that were pushed aside until now. The couple remain forever in my heart and the book goes on my Keeper Shelf. The only reason I gave this book 4.5 stars instead of the five is because of the suspense portion of the novel. It was a tad too grusome for my tastes. The end did suprise me. The chemistry between Seth and Oliva was fantastic."
3,Ghost Moon ....boring,"Let me start my review by saying that I am a Robards fan but, this book was a real yawn. Mrs. Robards is useing the plot of a sicko abducting little girls too much. As original as most of her books are it looks like she could come up with a new plot. She has also used the supernatural far to often. The ghost ruse was good in Walking After Midnight but I just got a feeling of been there done that in Ghost Moon. All in all Ghost Moon is not a bad book just a perdictable one."
4,Ghost Moon is excellent,"GHOST MOON is the first Karen Robards novel I've read (I just happen to see it in the library). I think Ghost Moon is a very good book, good story line. I highly recommend it. (Especially if you also like Nora Roberts and Kristin Hannah books.) The only down side is that I got so confused with the characters... there are so many! I really have to think which one is related to who and who's not. And what's up with Seth's Polo shirts and Khaki Pants... it must have been mentioned at least 50 times and it got kinda annoying."
1,DISTURBING,"This is a bad read. I am usually a great fan of Robards but lately, her books have taken a sick turn. They all seem to revolve around men preying on little girls, which leaves me wondering what has been going on in Robards life. I don't understand this new trend of romance writers writing contemporary pseudo-romances that focus a little too much on gruesome crimes against women/little girls. Don't read this book. I am all for romance and mystery but draw the line at supporting books (and movies) who's main focus is brutalizing women."
3,Didnt care for this one.,"I thought this book was boring compared to the rest of her awesome reads. I thought it died before it began. If you have never read Mrs. Robards, do not start on this book, any other will do."
3,Forgettable,"I don't think Robards is sure what she's writing. If you like a light romance novel with a twinge of suspense, you could certainly do worse. But this novel is bland, and fails as a mystery or suspense offering. It doesn't give you enough clues to figure out the killer until the end, unless you catch one solitary refence somewhere in the middle of the book. But it is quietly and carefully hidden in a multitude of characters that are so undefined that they blend into the background. Don't be tempted to pay retail for this one. If you've read more than 10 romantic suspense novels in your lifetime, then trust me, you've read this one."
2,Grisly romance,"As a blending of romance and suspense it doesn't quite make it. Human taxidermy on little girls is just too gruesome to work in a romance. A relationship between quasi cousins would be ok except that there was more of a sense of adoptive siblings between them which is just a little too close to incest for comfort. I would just as soon not have the villain of this particular profession not that this is particularly unusual. Finally, the relationship between the main characters is neglected in favor of the suspense. While I'm usually a Robards fan, not this time."
2,Disappointing!,"I have read all of Karen Robards books and usually enjoy them. However, this one had a cast of too many characters - it was confusing to keep track of them all. I didn't like the story content or the way it was written. There were so many characters being introduced at first and then nothing more about them, I wondered how they would all be tied into the story.What's with all these ""romance"" authors writing murder mysteries now? If I wanted to read about murders I would buy murder mysteries! I wish the romance authors would write about romance instead of murders.This book was a slow read."
4,Ghost Moon,This is the second book of Karen Robards that I've read. I really liked it. It was intriguing and surrounded by mystery that kept you guessing till the very end. She writes great suspense novels with a warming love story in between. Great book
4,Very good! Kept my interest!,"The only thing preventing me from giving this book a 5 star rating was: way too many characters to try to keep track of. (Leading lady, her daughter, her dead mother, step aunts and uncles, step cousins, step cousins daughter, step cousins fiance and her daughter,maids....etc) She could have cut back a few of the characters in my opinion. The other thing that really started to annoy me was that she must have mentioned at least 30 different times that Seth was wearing Kaki pants. Too descriptive of clothes all the time. However, the plot was very good and held my interest!"
1,stinkeroo!,"What a waste of birthday money on this one. Having read everything by Ms.Robards, this was a real disappointment. Next time I will not buy her book in hardcover, but will think strongly about even purchasing it in paperback! Sick storyline and too many characters to keep straight. What happened to the grandfather? Did he survive?"
3,little disappointed,"Don't get me wrong. Dick Hyman is really great in what he's doing. The pieces are brilliantly performed. But it's not my taste. He's playing 100s of staccatos where Scott Joplin never wrote a point on his sheets thus taking the drive off the songs. Songs and parts of songs that should sound strong just sound way too ""dolce"". All in all the whole cd is too soft and too slow. Yes, Scott Joplin said never play Ragtime too fast. But songs like the Entertainer or Elite Syncopations should in my opinion be played ""faster"" to have a drive. I used to play the songs myself. It's just more fun when you play them faster and louder - with more energy.This cd is for you when you like quiet and mellow music and like to drink tea while listening to it.If you like barrelhouse music - what ragtime is supposed to be - then buy another cd like ""the Sting"" soundtrack or Scott Joplin played by Richard Zimmerman."
5,Child of Appalachian Coalfields,"Sent this book to my 89 year old dad who knows Mr. Byrd and who also ran several coal mines in the 50's. So much of the book is true to every detail - this book tells of a time of hard work, good people, company ownership of it's employees, labor unions, and of times that only few know. It is a very pure piece of American History."
1,Surprising poor quality,"I purchased this set because the cable of my 15 years old Sony's headphone set got half disconnected. I expected far better quality than the Sony's old set. I was surprised by the narrow frequency range and the lack of details of the Sennheiser's set. Apparently, Sennheiser lacked high frequency and the response was not flat from low to high frequency. There were ups and downs. The lack of details made me feel that I was listening remotely, somewhat like listening from the next room. I don't recall the price of the Sony's set. Probably the second highest level but it is 15 years old and still far better than the Sennheiser's set. I have returned the latter. I think the Sennheiser's reputation is comparable to Sony's. I was surprised by the poor quality of the current set."
4,Delivers excellent sound without outside interference,"One of the greatest features of these headphones is the way they seal your ears from the endless droll of computer fans, noisy children, and occasionally dear mother.The sound is clear, and true to form -- just as it was intended to be heard. Other headphones of inferior quality might be capable of ""more bass,"" but the EH2270's bass is punchy and far from muddled. A great asset for the all-around music listener.The $200 price tag seems a bit high, since I paid around $70. If you can find them for under $100, then consider it a great value because few headphones sport the same quality to price ratio.Perfect headphones if the price is right and you appreciate neutrality in your music."
1,Do not buy to use with mp3 player / personal stereo,"I bought these to use with my Creative Jukebox Zen when travelling, but the moment I tested them I knew they were a waste of money. When listening to my mp3 I usually have the volume at 50% - in order to hear music at the same volume with these things I have to set the volume to maximum! Are you meant to place loudspeakers between the headphones and your ears? I don't understand how some retailers sell these at $200."
4,Good buy,"These are a better deal than the hd2200 .... You get a better closed shell (they cut down external noise very well) and decent sound for sennheiser standards (my hd560 were better, but an open design, not as nice to use @ work in the plane etc...). The sound is plain and not too colorful but solid and overall they are very comfortable."
3,Disappointing and Very Unbalanced.,"I was expecting much more from these headphones. They lack any coloration, warmth, and they give a hollow, distant sound. In Sennheiser's defense, they are made for studio use. They reproduce EXACTLY what is coming in to them, but they don't balance it or color it at all. In turn, this makes the trebles sharp and the bass lacking any depth. If you're working in a studio and need to hear exactly what's coming through, get them. If you're using them for home use, avoid them and go with Senn 497's (Cheaper and sound a lot better)."
5,Received was as Advertised,Product received was as advertised and met my needs. Quality and workmanship are good. Coating is durable. Eraly use shows that the holding power is good in ricky and mucky bottom.
5,An Amazing Concentration of Information,"This revised edition of Dr. Owen-Crocker's 1986 book does not disappoint. It incorporates vast amounts of new research, archaeological material, and reenactor feedback and includes many more illustrations as well as reconstruction sketches and intelligent discussion of the available evidence for Anglo-Saxon costume between the fifth and eleventh centuries. A must-have reference for any Anglo-Saxon scholar, as well as for anyone with a serious interest in northern European costume during the so-called ""Dark Ages."""
3,Just okay,I really like this group but this is not their best work. Be sure to listen to the snipets of each song on the Amazon website before you buy a cd!
5,Outstanding music.,"Same as ""The Very Best of Acoustic Alchemy"" I consider very relaxing music while I am driving going home no matter traffic jam and of course listening the CD at home with my family."
3,as good as it gets,"American/English is my 4th and latest Acoustic Alchemy CD which I have added to my collection.Everytime I listen to this CD (while driving or relaxing) the music soothes my soul, I have grown to love and appreciate every song. I would recommend anybody who loves smooth guitar music to purchase American/English."
3,Elevator music,"A pale, half-hearted set. Reminiscient of Positive Thinking from 1998, but without the energy. I can't fault the technical musicianship of the band: they're all super-accomplished. But this album left me cold. Blah."
4,"Great Musicians, Great Songs and Great Sound","Unlike some of the reviewers of this album, I had never heard of Acoustic Alchemy until recently, when a friend recommended them. They did not disappoint. Their music is a fusion of pop, jazz and country, and they are very accomplished musicians. Furthermore, their recording is outstanding; the details of all the instruments are there and the imaging is first-rate. The only reason I did not give this album 5 stars is that some of the tracks seemed repetitious and in several of the songs, the ""na nas"" seemed inane and detracted from the songs. (After all, they are not Paul and this is not ""Hey Jude"".) However, having said that, I like this group enough to purchase their other albums."
3,But the species of fruit never varies...,"This is a great magazine---to get once. Maybe twice. Each page features 1-2 people in their hip fashions. But the stuff...it isn't that spectacular. After so many pages of the same type of fashion, involving long jackets and clothes-over-clothes, high boots or knee-high socks, you feel that it doesn't really matter anymore.If you are REALLY into fashion, and the punk style in particular, then this is fitting. If you want it because you have a love for Japan or fashion is just a thing that you do, then it isn't worth the price for all of them."
3,INTERESTING CD,"I know a lot about Industrial music, and this is a strange cd. It sounds very contrived and not a whole lot like actual music. The cd has no real direction. In other words, this album is lost. Its very randon. It sounds like a whole bunch of different people got together and did their own thing and left it at that. Which is pretty much what this cd is. Bryan Black sings, and a different person from another band did the music. Of course its produced and engineered by Martin Atkins, he's a genius. The sound is crisp and clear. It has great beats and sounds, but it doesn't fit together very well. I like it. It could be much better. Many tallented people worked on it like Ray Watts, but it doesn't sound like they put their best effort into it. However, It is worth buying if your into this kind of stuff. Just don't expect anything spectacular................."
2,just skip to track two,"just skip to track two,listen enjoy,and then put on something else,maybe recoil,or pigface,or jared and the aliens.anything but this studio disaster."
2,Not verry good coldwave album.,"The song ""jet boy machine"" is the only cool track on this whole album. Hellbent is a side project from the frontman of the great Chicago industrial metal band Chemlab. This album, is not anything even close to being as good as a Chemlab album. I was quite dissapointed with this. Oh well."
1,These people must be crazy.,"I read the positive reviews and went out to get this CD, and these positive reviews are way wrong. This album sounds nothing like Chemlab, and it's verry stale and boaring. The only cool song is ""Jet Boy Machine"". I guess for the cheap price Amazon is charging, it's not a bad deal,...but don't expect too much."
3,A reasonable effort...,"If you're an experienced Hellbent listener, this album might be your cup of tea, but if you're just getting this album because Raymond Watts is on it, you might want to think it over a little before buying it. A lot of the songs seem off beat and structured in a weird way. The vocals, especially the harmony on one song, can be a bit annoying too. Hellbent incorporates a theme of pretty much not utilizing any guitars...making it more spacey and more electronic than industrial and I think that maybe if they had a really great guitarist, it would bring a lot of subdued songs out of a relatively low key rut. Oddly enough, as I normally can't stomach Sow, on the track Blo, she gives one of her best perfomances yet...reminiscent of Cry Baby. If you like Haloblack, this might be the album you're looking for."
3,Nice Idea,"The game provides a good opportunity to discuss the importance of helping others, especially when they're in ""trouble."" But there are a few too many elements (if you want to play the game correctly) to hold the interest of toddlers."
2,Recycled magazine articles for a cruise to Baja,"This book was disappointing. It read like a compilation of magazine articles. The book only dealt with cruising to Baja, Mexico, and had little to say regarding mainland Mexico, west or east coast. A very basic, simple book for someone who knows next to nothing about sailing or cruising."
4,great bath mat,I was looking for hotel style bath/shower mat. This is soft and plush - exactly as I wanted. A little longer than expected though.
3,"Good idea, but flawed.","My kitten has loved this tunnel since the day I brought him home. At first he used it to hide in. However, now that he is getting more comfortable he is playing with it instead. Unfortunately every time he gets a little crazy with his play time, the tunnel collapses or falls on him and then he can't play with it until I come over and fix it. I do this 30-40 times a day. I like the tunnel and it is a great idea, but it is flawed in the construction a bit. Maybe a sturdier frame would help with this problem."
1,You won't get it from Pepsistuff!,"Order this on 8/5/08 through Pepsistuff.com & was told it was backordered. Was supposed to be a delivery date of Yesterday-9/15/08. Got an email today, won't be delivered until 11/21/08.....yet it still shows it's available and IN STOCK to order. Don't fall for it! I'm still trying to find out how to cancel it and get the pepsistuff points back into my account."
3,good bang for the buck,"it's a good unit. sensitive to pressure, meaning while playing if you hold it too tight it will throw off the sound. Not sure if it will last over time. I needed it for a quick job and now it sits on my shelf till the next time. This unit is inexpensive and you get what you pay for, I knew that at the time of purchase.It served me well."
1,Too big for dictation - Requires two hands,I had a Sony before and purchased this recorder because of the cheaper price. The main benefit of a microcassette recorder is one hand operation. I have at least average size hands for a male and this machine is too large for one handed operation and its controls are awkward. I find myself distracted from the material I am dictating from to deal with the contols. If you want a dictating recorder get something smaller even if it costs more money.
3,not a good Quality product !,"I guess you get what you pay for ! It's good enough for my needs but I would not reccomend it for someone who needs it for every day use. The sound quality is very poor and you have to be close to the microphone to get any clarity.I must say that although I am a new Amazon customer, I highly reccomend them, they have an excellant return policy and stand behind their products."
3,Handheld Recorder,"I am enjoy using this product, but would like a little change with it. One to help with the way the tape runs on record. Also an indication when it is totally rewound."
1,Olympus has NO quality control!!!!,"I bought this Olympus recorder at a local electronics store (circuit city) and had to return the first one, since the record/playback head had a problem staying in physical contact with the tape. The playback volume would drop down in volume since the head was not snug against the tape during playback conditions.The second one worked okay for about six months, then guess what happened? You've got it - the same tape contact problem that occurred with the first sample occurred with the second. This time the problem was even worse - the recorder failed to record adequately, so that nothing but noise was on the tape. I see that both items were made in China - where quality control is much poorer than either Japan or Korea, at least that's my personal experience.While it worked, it was just ""okay"", nothing to brag about."
4,Great Little Recorder,"The Olympus Microcassette Recorder S711 is the perfect utensil for corporate meetings, fun stuff, and stuff you know you want to remember. At first, when searching I'd looked towards Sony for their microcassette recorders. Sony is also tiny, well made, and worth the price compared to the Olympus. But I wanted to test the Olympus out.Pros-Large, easy to use buttons. Looks SHARP in solid blue!-Allows 2 type of speeds. A 60 minute tape becomes a 120, etc.-From a name brand that you trust-Cheap, but accurate-3 tapes with 90 mins. can hold more than some digital recorders which top $50Cons-No tape counterOverall, I rate the Olympus 4 stars. It isn't too big or small, and it is accurate. It allows you to record with microcassette tapes, and has been proven much better than a digital voice recorder. I'm glad that I own it, and I would like you to have it too."
2,Memory Helper,I bought this to keep in my car so I wouldn't have to try and write everytime I need to remember something while I'm driving. Unfortunately it's cumbersome and not easy to use if you're driving. It's OK but I wouldn't buy it unless you're looking for something inexpensive and not to be used in the car. It's probably fine for classroom use but for driving you would need something different.
1,what a piece of doggie doo doo,"~ okay; it's true, it worked fine when i first took it out of the package, installed batteries and used it for several hours that first day while on vacation. I used it perhaps two more times the summer i purchased it (2010), then stowed it in the canvas bag where i keep all my writing materials.I pulled it out just now, installed FRESH batteries - fairly certain that the old ones were kaput after 2 years in storage - and can't get ANY power. I tried 3 other pairs of batteries (ALL fresh - none that were pre-used) and still; nada.I didn't even get 5 good uses out of this thing. Regardless of how long in between uses - it should power-up with new batteries. I'm very frustrated at this moment and am tempted to chuck this thing into the trash bin. I'll stall that action for 3 hours, until my husband gets home, in case i'm missing something (although i can't imagine what).Anybody else out there had similar issues? Is it a user-error?"
4,Nice Product,Pretty standard micro cassette recorder. Reliable and easy to use. It is a good recorder at a good price. I'd recommend it.
3,voice recorder,I got just what the description said. That is all I wanted.Something simple yet easy to use
4,Microcassette,I haven't actually used it - my daughter has it at college. But it looked like I thought it would and the delivery was very fast.
1,Cheap quality,"The reviews I read were mostly OK, but this recorder feels like a toy. A cheap toy! The packaging looked worn, like it was old. I shouldn't have even opened it, but I did, hoping for the best. It was at this point that I held the item and was surprised to find the quality of the item was cheap and flimsy. I even recorded a little bit, hoping that voice quality would make up for the lack of quality construction. This was not the case. I am returning this item immediately. And why are cassette recorders so pricey? Not satisfied at all with this item."
4,Nice Dictating MAchine,The Dictating device is easy to use and last a long time on the batteries suppliedEasy to find on your desk with is bright blue color
4,Convenient!,Tape recorder was easy to use and is compact enought to fit in my purse. Using it to take notes at meetings....easier than having to write it down!
3,Something to think about,This topic is new to me. This book presents some possible reasons to the similarities between Mormonism and Masonry. It's quite different from some other explanations that I've read. It offers some good ideas to think about.
2,Not Felice's best!,"Ambidextrous by Felice PicanoThis is a tale told in the first person of Mr. Picano's youth, from ages 10 to 13 and his many sexual encounters with both boys and girls. It is a time capsule of life of young teenagers in the fifties.Unfortunately, the book is a slow tedious read and not Mr. Picano's best effort. His homosexual relationship with Richard Victor (Rickie) Hersch is genuine, and a marvel to read, but his heterosexual relationships with Susan Flaherty and Franny Solomon are tedious and not ""real."" One feels like the writer is working too hard to tell his story.His prose is unorganized and jumps from the future to the past in an annoying way. His sense of self aggrandizement is at most boring and unbelievable.To quote Mr. Picano: ""...your first successful piece of writing is your best piece of writing--until you finally out achieve it with another piece of writing, terrifically new and phenomenally well done.' Ambidextrous IS NOT that piece...."
3,Needs more depth,"This is a nice little book to keep on your coffee table or bedside, but it really lacks depth. The Dalai Lama is so good at explaining the meaning of life, I often go out of my way to read his writings. This collection just left me a little flat, no disrespect to His Holyness."
2,had to modify did not fit my truck,"description said it fit a 2001 Ford F150. The box it was shipped in said Ford F250-350. I had to grind weld joints off a housing on the motor and then reuse parts of the old motor to get it to fit. Motor was correct but it came with the wrong mounting,"
3,Book,The book and cd are okay but is not what I expected. I bought it for our womens bible study but I don't think I will use it.
1,Never got it.,"I order this and paid for it. Never got it. I had ordered some other things that day and forgot this was among them. When I realized that I had ordered it and not gotten it, I e-mailed the vendor. 2 weeks later and no reply. DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS VENDOR!"
5,An Unpolished Morse,"Frost is an English policeman in a mid sized English city (Denton) who is an unpolished (Inspector) Morse.He is not neat,dislikes authority (comic elements in both),but is clever,brave,lucky and empthetic withvictims.He is given a new partner in each episode.The acting,photography,music and characterdevelopment are excellent.In series 6,his house has been rebuilt(after the fire) and he takes in a lodgerto help pay his bills (includes a loveable dog).In the first case,he solves an old case (Appendix Man) afterbeing convinced to withdraw his resignation.In the second he solves a case with a dead teenaged runaway and meat processorswho are involved in smuggling and ultimatelymurder.The most attractive feature of this set is the pricereduction which brings it in line with similarDVD sets.One does have to get used to the Englishuse of episode titles which are not very revealing orinformative to US viewers.An excellent series."
5,Love the Frost series,"I discovered Frost a few years ago on A&E and enjoyed the series a lot. I bought the VHS tapes that were available at that time. I now have a DVD player and was happy to be able to buy the rest of the series. I love his combination of toughness when dealing with a criminal and his compassion when dealing with the victims. I'm curious to know if the series is still on the air in England - if so, I'm looking forward to buying the dvd's when they come out. I even enjoy the characters so much that I have bought some of the Frost books. In other words, I'm a real fan."
5,"win, lose or draw game",ive had this game before and that is why i ordered a new one. it is great entertainmen. the product was in great condition (only one corner of the lid was smashed) but im not sure if that was before it was shipped or not. everything else was excellent. highly recommend.
3,"Insightful, disturbing, informed and depressing.","This book links the Holocaust, the Challenger disaster and contemporary issues of public administation, questioning the methods and motivations. It ties in a wide variety of disciplines to give a full and well argued perspective. It brings home the horrors of 1940s Germany to America today. It pleads with the reader to develop an historical conscience. If you work in public administration you should read it. The book has relevance for everyone, but limits itself to the public sector, due to its links with the series on advances in public administration. An uncomfortable, but important book to read."
4,pondery unsuredness,"so, the concept of the book and the basic premise is both interesting and a worthwhile read. People who are unfamiliar with the concept will find this book one they can digest without much problem. My only hesitation is that this book immediately defaults to easy arguments, the Holocaust. I would be more impressed if they had tried to find administration evils that were perhaps more mundane in origin and ones that people can't as easily shrug off. I watched students to easily point out that this example was one that was so extreme that the claim got lost in the glare of emotion attached to the example."
5,A Must Read for Every Student and Professional,"This book is terrific; it should be required reading for all college students. The issues are well-presented and well-integrated. The authors present a thoughtful argument that considers how well-intentioned people can become cogs in administrative evil. The book implores folks to examine those routine work tasks that we don't consider, we just DO. They argue there is a critical need to examine ALL actions for the potential harm it can cause others. It's great to see Public Policy experts put a spotlight on the facts and inspire their own and others to become great citizens and ethical leaders.Bravo."
1,Tragically flawed work,"This work is inviting for its topic and intriguing thesis, but is alas filled with embarrasing flaws in logic if not in fact. Regretfully, one has to read it to believe the incredible connections made by the authors between the Holocaust and the Challenger accident. Even more bizarre is the link between Nazi Germany and contemporary US public policies. Readers should beware."
1,POOR Quality,"I bought this for my daughter to wear for this winter. I order her actual size (3T). It runs atleast 2 sizes to big and the buttons all broke. I can't even believe that ALL the buttons broke just from trying it on. I would love to know if i just got a ""bad"" coat or if they are all like this...... Thanks C"
1,Terrible sound quality,"I have no doubt that these two performances, in the hall, were transcendently beautiful. I got this because I love Horowitz and I love these piano concertos. Sadly, the sound quality is so bad it sounds like there was one microphone, somewhere in the back, plugged into the first tape recorder ever made. There must be other Horowitz performances of these pieces. I will look for them. In the meantime, if you have landed on this hoping for something wondeful, keep looking."
4,great laptop,Its my first laptop and makes me want to never use a desktop again. The keyboard is slightly different but you quickly adapt.Its quick and quiet. The screen is wonderful for photo work.
2,no original OS disks included...,Toshiba does not supply the original Microsoft operating system disks with their computers. This is a huge negative! They only supply recovery disks from which you can only revert your system to the way it was on day one.
5,Classic Ruben,"With songs like Tiburon and Ligia Elena, this album is quintesentially Ruben and should be on any fan's selection. The music is classic Blades and the lyrics are poignant, funny and socially concious. As always, Mr. Blades' insight into Latino culture reverberates throughout his music and offers a better understanding of our dynamics as children of the Caribbean and Latin America."
5,Charming and funny,"I loved this wonderful little book! It's a light read about a 35 year old mother of 3 children--one a baby--who has just gone through a divorce and is raising her children in a large,ramshackle house in the English countryside.Venetia is suffering from self doubt in a large measure but is actually a wonderful mother who puts her childrens interests first before fussing about a tidy house. I'd recommend this charming and amusing book to anyone but particularly to mothers of young children."
4,A Very Enjoyable Read,"I thoroughly enjoyed Rafaella Barker's Hens Dancing. As a mom, I can relate to the joys and trials of raising children. She also deals with the topic of single parenthood and the struggle to balance life in an imbalanced world, and she manages to do so with a delightful sense of humor. This is Ms. Barker's first novel to be published in the States, and I sincerely hope it won't the her last."
5,"Not only for academia, but for all thoughtful women","Introduced during a Women's Studies class (University of Wyoming), I return to this ""researched"" book again and again. My copy's heavily underlined and starred. Here goes a typical quote: (about learning) ""Much time has been wasted (on women's) being good...."" (209) A woman's route to knowledge begins with ""silence,"" goes to passively receiving knowledge from authorities (usually men), then to ""intuiting"" knowledge (explanation of angel and crystals phase?), and to the final (or ultimate) of ""integrating knowledge."" Integrating means combining the intuitive with academic investigation. Along this route, many of us (women) are stuck, pre-distined by our familial backgrounds, or bumping through the educational system. This books gives us more and pre-dates REVIVING OPHELIA--more to measure where we are in our own learning"
3,dated but still relevant,"I bought this book because this is part of my course reading. Its interesting, but because it was written in the 1970s, I had some difficulty understanding the language. In addition, the style is quite long drawn, and I don't understand some parts of what the authors were trying to get at. Having said that, the book is quite thought provoking in a certain way, although I couldn't help but wonder if the research is still relevant totally, since the research is only on women. What about men? Don't they think in similar fashion? Or how about the evolution of technology that has profound impact on the way communication and thinking are done today? Makes for thoughtful read nevertheless."
3,"Ok for a textbook, but wouldn't read for leisure","I purchased this for a class and I will agree with some of the reviewers that a lot of the content does not seem very relevant today. Interesting ideas, but perhaps a litle dated. I have to confess also that this was not really what I was expecting for a women's studies course, so maybe I was a little dissapointed. I am really interested in women's history and the women's movement. This is more of a psychology book and I found it a bit dull and slow going.Note: Did receive book promptly and in excellent condition!"
4,Women,personally the book is more educational than for enjoyment. However there are short blurs in each section that are very interesting. the book was one of the more enjoyable books i have ever had to read for class
4,Nice but not what I expected.,"First of all, this noise cancelling headphone works its job. When I put it on my ears without turning on the power switch, it probably reduces the sound up to 50%. When the power switch is turned on, then I would say the sound is probably dampened to 65-70% from the outside noise.The main reason why I bought this headphone was that I wanted to be free from the noise environment in the usual college dorm. I really should have listened to those early reviewers for this product. Why? It does not dampen the human voices and like other people say, the high pitch sounds are not dampened. I have to agree though that it does kill the low pitch sound. Anyway, this headphone is good for listening to music because it really works for that. What I want to warn you guys is that if you want a complete silence or tranquility, this is not the right product you are looking for."
4,Top value in a fit-in-pocket noise cancelling headphone,"Board plane, put in ears, turn on noise canceling, sleep. Or listen to your movie (on your laptop)or their movie (using adapter that comes with unit) without going deaf competing with sounds around you. It does this and it fits in your pocket too. Sure Bose is best (and hundreds of $$ more), but you'll have to pack and unpack to get at Bose headset. (Oh, comes with three sets of earbuds--I use medium, my wife uses the small)."
4,Good read,"Once again Jacq brings a long gone era to life for the reader. I found his discription of the landscape and culture to be helpful in understanding ancient times, especially the Hyksos invasion and occupation."
4,Kim Waters Soulful Cd,"Living in Waterbury Ct where this cd was produced gives it a special meaning to it. Have seen Kim in concert a few times @ SCSU in New Haven and the music that he blows out of that little sax is incredable just like the title track ""YOU R MY LADY"""
1,Would somebody please get this guy a live band?,"Well, well...another lame CD from the ""King of Drum Machines"". KW is a great sax player, but I wish that he would hire a back up band instead of relying on drum machines and other electronics to produce music. This stuff sounds like karaoke music or something that my 4-year-old plays on her toy keyboard. I do, however, like his rendition of Marvin Gaye's ""Got To Give It Up"", but still it would sound so much funkier if the song were performed by a live band instead of a computer. Anyway, if you like poorly produced ""electonica"", then you may enjoy this CD. Ohterwise, try some Sanborn, Najee, Kirk Whalum or Boney James for your ""saxual"" pleasure."
3,sized smallish,"they advertise this as being ""one size fits all"", but I am 6-0, 185 lbs., 34 in. waist, and the bottom of the vest... well, the V shaped velcro barely reached around.otherwise, a great vest -- lightweight, breathable, and definitely better than wearing a wind-breaker jacket."
1,Failed to detect power supply failures,"I have now had three bad power supplies that tested ""good"" with this tester. These power supplies were all 250W 20 pin power supplies from Dell Optiplex computers (if that matters). All power supplies would turn on, the fans were running, but did not give enough power to the systems. The systems would not even reach post. I'm now guessing that this tester can only detect a completely dead power suppply. Of course that would be pointless to use a tester on. Would not recommend this tester. I also noticed that virtual hideout gave a great review on this tester. My tester is a virtual-hideout edition. Seems like a conflict of interest."
2,"Bad Outing For Big Joe Turner & T-Bone Walker, But Not Their Fault","There is no Pete Johnson-like piano playing on this album, and Turner's sound is radically altered from the classic Big Joe Turner mold. T-Bone Walker barely does any solo-ing on his half of the cd. This disc is a failure; plain and simple. Please check out Joe Turner's classic recordings with Pete Johnson and T-Bone Walker's stuff from the '40s and '50s. Avoid this boring disc like the plague. Perhaps the only reasons this disc gets two stars are Turner's great performance on ""Plastic Man"" and Walker's performance on ""Vietnam""."
4,Clancy's replacement found,"After researching a half dozen authors to replace Clancy, whose work I had finished, I chose Dean Ing and was not disapppointed. Set in the days just previous to the Gulf War, when most people became aware of stealth technology, Ing has crafted a fine story with real characters and believable dialog. The only criticism I have is that Ing's timeline jumps around too much. Ing has a gift for the analogous and characters are easily identified. Since I generally stay with one author until I exhaust their work, I'll be looking for Ing's other novels next. Glad to say there is life after Clancy."
2,a sorry collection of stories,"This is yet another short story collection supposedly edited by Alfred Hitchcock. Well if old Alfie indeed chose these stories and plop his name on the book then, well, he was an old fool. All the stories are uniformly mediocre. I suspect they were never published elsewhere. The book publisher undoubtedly got these stories on the cheap and thought they could make a buck off the Hitchcock name. Well they didn't get a buck off me, .. I paid 50 cents for this book at a thrift store. Even still I feel ripped off.Bottom line: a collection of utterly forgettable stories that should never have published. Pure rubbish."
1,Wrong Name,You can't relax to this cd. To much talking by Bob Hope and Jerry Lewis. And too much clapping before and after most of the songs. Was very disappointed. Sent cd back and haven't heard from any body yet. Will not order any more until I hear from them.
1,Poor recording,"Too much talking in background and Dean dosen't sound like himself on some songs. He dosen't sing some songs like they should be song. Very disapointed in this cd. Out of 44 songs there are only about 6 to 8 songs that are any good. Will send this cd back, not happy with it at all."
5,This is the best.....,"I have used Clinique non-streak bronzer on my face and forearms for years! For some reason, it is only available as a Men's product, but it used to be available as a regular item in the Clinique line for Women. I was told years ago that this is the same product as the Women's bronzer, and it is exactly the same. It does not streak and, most important, it does not come off on clothing. I dab it on my face, lightly rub it in every morning, and wash it off at night. I use it on my forearms when wearing short-sleeved clothing in the summer months."
4,Get yourself thinking,"Unquestionably the book is difficult and the plot weaves every which way around the characters of a small community. There is a horrific tone within the symbolic play of light/dark, water/earth, and the meaning of the double hook."
3,Mixed Feelings,"If this book were any longer, it might not be worth the effort required. However, it's brevity makes it possible to give it the two readings it probably requires (or at least, I required).My three star rating reflects my mixed feelings about the book. It is interesting, but I feel its ambiguity wasn't entirely necessary.All the characters in this book are pretty despicable,which I don't necessarily mind, I just wish I knew more about them in the end. The afterword mentions that Watson cut out a lot of the personal history of the characters in the editing process. I think I would've liked it more if she had kept that sort of thing in.Also, an introduction would be particularly helpful, especially one that introduces the reader to the Coyote myth."
3,The Double Hook- Sheila Watson,"This is NOT the worse novel that I have ever read! The symbolism and imagery bleeds out of this novel and the writing style makes the reading a challenge. However, the same way that Shakespeare's works are difficult to understand there is a reward when you discover the true meanings. When you read this book for the first time take it with a grain of salt and guess at the symbols your probably right. Reading is a personal experience and you can't be wrong if you can explain your view. Don't be discouraged, if I can do it, you too can catch the glory. When all else fails read the earlier edition from 1969 and peruse Grubes introduction, it's pratically Cole's notes."
3,Looking for help,"I have recently read this book and I think it is quite interesting. But some what confusing. I have chosen to use it for a research paper in English. I was wondering if any one could direct me to any web sites or articles that review this book in more detail. I need some help in trying to write about and explain (to me) the function of various ideas that appear throughout the novel. Ie.The function of imagery, superstition, religion, the isolated village. Anything to do with the ideas of guilt shame, responsibility, birth and/or death. I need a place to start and some available literature to make reference to etc. Thank-you to anyone who can help."
1,Avoid at all costs,"How can this book be considered a classic? It makes little sense, the images created are hard to understand. Basically, this off- the beat book is irritating and senseless, and leaves no impact on the reader whatsoever."
1,Hahahaahahaaaa! This Book is so SAD!,"I cried while reading this book,sob!sob!...yeah, no kidding! i actually did, and you know why? because this book is actually torturing me! even after putting a whole lot of effort, concentration, time and sweat.... Pheww! pant!pant!....to understand this book!I don't even know what's the meaning of 'The Double Hook'!The book is so over-descriptive and the words are so hard to understand.In this book, some parts really doesn't make sense at all! That's it! i think i'm gonna go back and cry!aarrrgghhh!"
1,What can I say? It sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!,I read this book and it is so boring and it does not make any sense. I had to read it for english class and I have to answer questions on it and I have no clue what the book is about. I'm trying to read it again but it is soooo.. mind numbing. It is the dumbest book that I've ever read.
1,Can't get past the tenth page,"Don't get me wrong: I'm used to stories without plots, or told in images, or told in very complex ways. So when I say that I have no wish to go beyond page ten in this page, it has nothing to do with the complexity: the book is just bad. Your literature prof may try to tell you it's great, and you may be happy that it's such a short book. But give me a 1000-page Dickens novel anyday over this. I don't care about the characters, and the writing is silly, and tries to be deep. It is not deep though--it's just a very sticky novel and you would get more out of your life by painting happy-faces on your toenails than by reading this schock."
4,Pageant of Europe,"I used this book as a text in college, 50 plus years ago. The author was our lecturer. It is too bad I sold it at the end of the school year. The style is an interesting history book. I am happy to have it to read at my leisure."
4,love this album...,"I was upset at MJ for 'switching' over to country sounds on this album...I kept playing it often in the beginning, and tried to like it...but it just came over as a bias...I like the song, 'It's Only Over For You'...very touching and reminds anyone of their break-up with someone they loved...Out of this album came 3 songs I believe that catapulted him to country stardom...with 2 of those songs going #1 on the Country Charts...Because of his 'switching over to country'in this 1986 released album, I would give it a 4.25 starts out of 5 starts...I still play this **vinyl** album from end to end..."
4,"Early seasons mostly for die-hard fans, but still enjoyable","If you're a die-hard Red Dwarf fan (and I am), you'll want to own this (and I do). If you have any doubts about whether you'll enjoy the show, skip ahead to season 3. These first two seasons are really all about establishing the characters and the premise, and some of the acting feels a little wooden and ""stage-y.""In other words, if I were introducing a Red Dwarf newbie to the series (assuming they'd agree to a marathon viewing session of something they know nothing about), I'd probably show excerpts of episodes from season 1, a few episodes from season 2, and start right in on season 3. And in my view, the REALLY fun, whacked-out stuff doesn't get rolling until season 4.Anyway, all of that said, it's still an incredibly original and fun premise, and even these faltering early seasons beat the socks off of just about anything you can watch on TV right now."
4,Finally available on DVD,"After years of waiting, they finally released the first two series on dvd. With deleted scenes, smeg-ups, and lots of misc. other stuff, they're well worth the money and the wait. I can hardly wait until next year when series 3 and 4 are available."
5,Extras Galore,"The amount of work put into this DVD collection is incredible. Not only were they able to convince all four stars to commentate all the episodes, they also provide the fans with plenty of bonus features. Bloopers, model shots, music, videos, and the featurette RD A to Z. It's only season 1 & 2! I can't wait to see the extras on season 3 & 4!"
4,First rate sci-fi comedy,"Red Dwarf is easilt the best sci-fi comedy series I have incountered, and the first two seasons are the best, those that follow the origional formula before a more to a more sci-fi form. Consistantly funny and well acted with entertaing charactors. Worth watching, and very entertaing."
4,"AAAH, Rimmer!","What can I say except it's too expensive? That's the only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. How could anybody not love the obsequious Rimmer, brilliantly played by Chris Barrie? (I admit I've got a soft spot for him, though.) And Cat! When he steals the champagne from Kochanski's honeymoon suite I almost fell off the chair laughing.This is such great fun that I'm almost tempted to watch them all over again immediately, since the next 2 seasons apparently won't be out until next spring."
5,Red Dwarf is Hear and It's About Time,"I have loved this TV show ever since first saw it when I was a little kid and now that I'm older and able to understand all of the jokes, I love it even more. I have been waiting to be able to purchase all eight of the Red Dwarf seasons some where other than the Red Dwarf website which had split up the eight seasons into eighteen VHS tapes that cost twenty dollars apiece I recommend this to anyone who has a sense of humor but I would like to warn you that the joke are crude sometimes so I wouldn't recommend this for people who are offended by bathroom jokes. I'm proud to see this show coming to America and I think if you have any sense of humor at all you will find this show hilarious."
5,Smeg-tastic,I am a Brit living in USA and was very happy to hear about the US release of the DVDs. I have both series and have not laughed so much in ages. My trusty old Red Dwarf Videos are wearing out from so much use and so the DVD's couldn't come at a better time.By far the best thing is the commentary from the 4 main cast members. They clearly haven't watched the episodes in years and are obviously having a lot of fun remembering what went on at the time. I'm not sure that all Americans will understand some of the words they use (some of them are very London based colloquialisms) but I understood them and enjoyed each episode with the commentary. I haven't laughed so much in ages.It's simply SMEGTASTIC.
5,Purists Rejoice!,"Thank-you, BBC, for giving us these episodes untouched! For those of you who, like me, cringed at the extra special effects added to the original series, this is a treasure! These episodes are the ones we enjoyed watching on PBS when they first made their way across the pond: original 80's mega-ecstasy bliss! I didn't even think these gems were available anymore, but I thank those responsible for recognizing their value . For extra fun, the Japanese version of ""The End"" is featured in Series One - complete with all the added special effects & new theme music. Great for comparison!"
5,"""Breath Prayers"" sharpens focus and spiritual walk!","""Breath Prayers for African Americans"" is an excellent book for ANYONE to add to their library. It teaches you how to be in constant contact and fellowship with the Father, and THAT is awesome. It is a MUST HAVE. I am going to suggest that our church bookstore stock this book. Also, I am going to bless the women in my Bible Study group with a copy. To Edna Jordan, I want to say, ""Thanks for being such a wonderful vessel for theLord!"""
1,Must ask....,"Um....just wondering and have to ask.....why the need to designate ""For AFRICAN AMERICANS""? Does the color of one's skin have anything to do with praying or being in God's presence? Does the soul have a color? If man looks at the outside and God looks at the heart....shouldn't all hearts be the same color? If the book had been titled ""Breath Prayers for Caucasians"", there would be outcry for sure....and it is actually a good book....too bad the title ruins it for me."
1,Glasses too small even for a 3 year old.,"The product description says this is for a four or five year old.The helmet fit fine, but the glasses were too small for my three year old.In summary, only buy this product if you don't want the glasses or you have another kid to give them to."
1,Banned in Korea?,"I can't see a reason why this would be banned in Korea, other than this is a terrible movie. From start to finish, this is just horrible. I couldn't tell if it's supposed to be a satire, black comedy, or just misguided. At the end of the film, the hero chants, ""Namiho renge kyou,"" over and over. If they just bothered to ask someone, they could have found out what the real chant is supposed to sound like. The pacing is so flat, ""Pink Flamingos"" is like ""Road Warriors"" in comparison.Don't soil your brain with this. Our lives on this planet are short enough without wasting a minute on this."
5,review of Hippocrates' works collection,This was an ideal gift for an outstanding college grad; it reflected both material we had studied and the interests of the student. It arrived promptly and was in great condition.
3,Don't waste the money!!!,"My son is a big Bob the Builder fan, and I thought this would be a good bed for him so he would stop sleeping with me. However, the bed only stays inflated for half the night before he is flat on the floor again. Once the air leaves the bed and he gets uncomfortable on the floor he is awake and back in my bed. I should have spent the money on something more durable."
1,whats the secret to KEEPING IT INFLATED,"this is the second bed there must be a secret to the darn un...inflatable bed , my granddaugher has yet to sit on it let alone sleep on it someone call and spill the beans.......beverly"
3,Watch out for rollovers,"While realizing that this bed was for three years and up, I thought this would make a nice alternative for my 2.5 year old son who has stretched beyond the confines of his pack and play. Imagine the gut wrenching fear that overcame me when I went to check on him before I went to bed and discovered that the bed had flipped completely over on him as well as the heating register. Needless to say, he was a bit warm and sweaty, but thankfully that was it, and that was it for the bed, as it will be returned and our search for a portable alternative will no doubt continue. If you think this would be hard to flip, just put the bed on the floor and tug on the loose material on the side of the bed, just as a youngster might do if they roll too far to the side of the mattress."
5,THANK YOU READY BED!,"Both my sons, ages 2 and 4 got these for Christmas. WOW - I love them. We had an ""issue"" with our 4 year old always wanting to sleep with us. Not now - he sleeps in this everynight. I must confess, one night, not only was he in our bed but the inflatable mattress was there too! :-) This was also great when they caught the flu. We brought both mattresses downstairs and they could lay around and watch movies. I know we will use this a lot for sleepovers, visiting grandparents, etc. Definately worth the money!"
5,ORIGINAL!,"This is possibly the quirkiest, weirdest and most original hip-hop album I've ever heard. The rhymes are odd and off base yet stay uniquely in theme for the album, the production is stellar and minimalistic and it's had me grinning from ear to ear on more than a few occations.2 favourite songs:1-800-Suicide ft. KRS-OneNowhere To Run, Nowhere To Hide ft. Don McKenzie, Gerald Whaley, Kurious"
3,Not so much use for MacOS X,"This book does not cover mach with the Apple Macintosh as the book appears to be out of date.It does, however, cover MIG which is available for the Mac."
2,Dreadful sound quality,This movie may actually be interesting... if it was possible to understand what the actors are saying... The dubbing is simply dreadful and it is pretty much impossible to understand what exactly is going on...
1,"Ruined bedding and towels, and had to be fixed at the salon!","I have colored my hair for years, and tried a variety of products. Recently I decided to try Herbatint because I thought it would be better for my hair, as it makes natural claims. Three days and more than 5 washes later, it was still bleeding out onto my towels and my pillow cases at night- permanently staining them. The rinse water would run clear, but somehow it was still rubbing off onto everything. I had to go to a salon to have them use some kind of ""exfoliating"" shampoo to get rid of the problem. Worst of all, I contacted the company to offer them the opportunity to respond to my compaint, and heard nothing. Terrible product, terrible customer service."
2,Weird Colors,"So, I tried Herbatint back in 2009 right before I was supposed to go to court. I used 4M, hoping for a nice reddish-brown color on my naturally dark brown hair. Well, I had eggplant purple hair! It was really shiny, but also freakishly purple. Not wanting to totally write the product off, I tried it again a few months ago as I normally use Naturcolor and could not find 3N Burdock, my normal color. I tried 2N Brown in Herbatint and had Elvira black hair. Additionally, it dried out my ends something terrible. I really like the exrta shine that this product imparts on the hair, but the colors are soooo whacky. Check out Naturcolor as it is a much gentler product and the colors are more predictable."
2,Allergic reaction,I tried this product for the first time thinking that it has natural ingredients boy was I wrong. After a few hours of coloring my hair I couldn't stop itching my scalp. I was so uncomfortable and by the next day I rushed to my doctor's office. My scalp swelled up and I got a allergic reaction. NEVER AGAIN!!
1,Misleading Title,"This book has an over-reaching title and at best is a catalog that describes toys. Placing the words ""special needs"" in the title implies that it would provide specific pointers for helping children with all sorts and degrees of disabilities like CP, visual impairments, hearing impairments, deafblindness, mental retardation, etc. and might at least have a section on augmentative communications. It offers VERY LITTLE on these topics. As for the dialogues, I found them to be of poor quality and contrary to other stuff I have read. Some of the dialogues for a child who hasn't begun to talk have tons of words and lots of adjectives yet later the same book suggests that teaching the concepts of 'up' and 'down' in the same play session might be too confusing for the child. I don't know what the author's Ph.D. is in but I hope it isn't in speech and language pathology."
1,Check your copy carefully,"The book is merely a list of toys, generally commercially available, that might stimulate or help a child communicate. My biggest complaint is with the printing. I wondered why young children (3 - 18 months) had so few notations, and discovered why yesterday... My copy jumps from page 50 to page 83. The pages didn't fall out of the binding - they were not included when the book was bound. So check yours when you buy. I am not sure if this a problem unique to me or not. However, I called the publisher and they sent me a replacement immediately and free. I did not have to hassle with sending back the defective one. Excellent customer service!"
2,Not a Keeper,"I have many titles by this author. But as I am clearing out my bookshelves, I found I never 'read' this book, just skimmed through. Therefore, I am not keeping it. I am not very interested in ' terrible misunderstanding' themes.The back blurb:Badder Than BeforeYears ago, teenage Nicki Lockwood had been the only one in town to see past Travis Halloran's bad-boy leather jacket and tough talk--until she'd seen just how bad he was. He'd carelessly caused her father's death, then lied and denied it. And now Travis was back, ready to do even more damage.To save one of their own, the mighty Lockwoods had destroyed Travis Halloran. And as he'd rotted in jail, he'd called himself every kind of a fool for believing that wealthy, wide-eyed Nicki would know he wasn't guilty. Now, at last, he could prove his innocence. But his proof was worthless because the truth would destroy Nicki--the woman he'd waited forever for..."
1,Money Back Guarantee,"Shadow Pro's web site clearly states there is a 30 day money back guarantee on unopened products. I ordered this for my husband for Christmas and have tried to contact shadowpro to return this item which he did not want. They do not return my e-mail requests, there is no address on the web site. If you call the phone number on his site they say we can't help you and we don't have an address either. I would be truly suspect of any product with this type of service. SSwanson"
4,Very pretty,"I really like the glass. It is advertised as 13""x 30"" overall but it is only 12 x 29. This is for a bathroom window for privacy so the size was a little disappointing. Also on the metal frame there is a paint chip which is not a big deal because I will touch it up but it should not be there. The glass work itself is very nice."
5,"Mediaeval Baebes - Gorgeous, sensual sound!","I first heard this album last year when my cousin asked for it for Christmas. I hadn't heard of them before, and was immediately hooked.Their style of overlapping sounds & phrasing was so captivating that I went on to purchase more of their albums, although this one is still myfavorite.I've given several copies as gifts to other people, and everyone that I've introduced to their music has enjoyed it and found something new to comment on.A must for your CD collection!"
4,Solid album,Good album. Only listened through a couple times so far and its not shaping up to be a new favorite but this is classic Baebes and has everything I've grown to love about the group.
4,As expected,"More of the same, really, so long time fans of the Baebes will be very happy with this new release. A consistently good album, with a few tracks making it to ""beautiful"", and their rendition of ""Scarborough Fayre"" not the saccharine nightmare I was afraid it would be.For those who are yet to buy a CD from the Baebes, I'd recommend that you start with their first release, ""Salva Nos"", which remains their most haunting and beautiful album to date. However, for those of us who know and love their work, have no fear, ""Mirabilis"" is well worth grabbing."
2,Ho Hum,"I am so dissapointed. I was really looking forward to this CD but it just doesn't live up to my expectations. All the songs seem to have the same tempo and sound and it all runs together - I honestly could not tell one song from another. I was hoping for something more like Worlds Blyse (which I love), this just didn't do it for me."
4,Pleasant Music,This CD contains some very enjoyable music. Fun to listen to. I will definately buy more of their CD's.
4,The Spelling Is The Only Problem,"The music is definitly medieval all the way. These ladies were meant be together to perform music from the renaissance era. There ought to be more classical radio staions aired in this country to play this kind of music. Maybe even a radio station to play only medieval/renaissance music? This CD would get a lot of airtime. Sounds good to me! The only problem I have is the spelling of the name of that band. Everytime I go to look them up, I spell it M-E-D-I-E-V-A-L B-A-B-E-S and they spell it M-E-D-I-A-E-V-A-L B-A-E-B-E-S. Aside from the spelling, their music is from the renaissance times. My favorite is Star of The Sea."
1,This is truly bad stuff! Zero rating...if they would let me.,"I cannot believe how this ""ensemble"" has managed to pull the wool over so many. This stuff is truly awful. In addition to the poor singing, the voices have been synthesized and pasteurized through an electronic equilizer -- just as well, it probably actually IMPROVED their gawd awful lack of vocal talent.I must give credit though to the mastermind behind the marketing in managing to sell this garbage to the masses -- pretty cover pictures of pretty girls...a clever name...a nonsense hybrid of new age garbage with medieval music.It really is amazing how a photo of pretty women and the word ""baebes"" can fool so many into buying this stuff."
3,Entertaining,"""The Dark"" is a kind of early ""Predator"" type of movie. The effects are atcually quite good, but of course, when compared to new films, it falls flat. That said, the story is kind of entertaining, and if you are into Sci-fi/horror movies, you should check it out."
1,Amazon Needs To Get Their Act Together,"This was NOT directed by Tobe Hooper. It was directed by John 'Bud' Cardos. They also have movies in Hooper's director's section which he did not direct, specifically, ""Venom"". There aren't even any options to make corrections."
4,Gift for Husband,I bought this as a gift for my husband who always talked about watching this when he was younger. He loved it and was so excited to be able to watch it again.
5,So bad it's good!!!!!,"The Dark is one of those sci-fi/action/thriller movies that is big on talent(William Devane, Richard Jaeckel) and not much else. There is a murderer on the loose in L.A., is it an alien? We don't know! Is it a supernatural monster? We don't know!What we do know is somebody or some THING is killing people at night in L.A. and the only one who can stop him is a down and out, alcoholic writer,(Devane, who is also the father of the killer's first victim), who finds out who the killer is from a clairvoyant old woman. The only saving grace about this celluloid turkey,(other than Cathy Lee Crosby as eye candy), is Richard Jaeckel's typical, but nonetheless letter perfect portrayal of the tough cop,(with a great big .357 Magnum) who's gonna get the killer no matter what! This movie is a must have for all Richard Jaeckel fans! Oh, there's also a blind guy who is seen walking at night throughout the movie who doesn't even get so much as a scratch."
3,"Very cute, but a bit complicated for young girls","My daughter got this Barbie last Christmas, when she was 4 years old. It's a very sweet set--nice that Barbie actually looks like a teenage girl without tons of makeup--but the set up is too complicated for very young girls. I would recommend it for ages 6 and up."
4,To complicated for little ones,"I bought this last christmas for my then 3 year old. Barbie is now with the other Barbies and Krissy is in the Fisher Price playhouse. It was hard for my daughter to get Barbie to hold baby Krissy. The attachment was soon lost. The canopy would not stay attached to crib. My daughter still plays with all peices, but not at same time."
4,New Baby,...The curtains glow in the dark and add us a night light.The crib rocks the doll and plays a song when the baby goes inside the crib.It has a tiny bottle and pacifier.It also has a fabric fastener.You wrap the fastener around the baby and attatch the pin to Barbie's arm.Press the button on Barbie's back and she rocks Krissy.This toy deserves a reward.
4,Very Cute,This toy is fun if your player like to play with barbies. A 3-8 year old would probably enjoy this most. It's crib make's a lullaby when you turn the swicth. It is a very cute and fun toy if your player is a barbie fan.
4,cute,"my daughter (4) loves this - I got it when she was 2-1/2ish as a bribe because she HAD TO HAVE IT and I wanted her to start having her BMs in the commode (too much info there, huh?). It sat on the back of the commode for a week and voila, thank the stars my life was improved!! But really, she's had it for a while now, still has all the pieces, still plays with it. THe bed is amazingly sturdy/flexible and the battery for the music has yet to die (sigh). I recommend it for girls who are Barbie fans."
1,Both Locking Studs broken in about a year,"Got this guitar from local Costco. Looking great, sounds good, till today, less than a year old. Both locking screws on the bridge broke one after another, due to metal fatigue I guess - or poor material used for such an important piece of the instrument. Never happened to any other guitar I played in the past 30 years. This has to be the worst! I only played this guitar a handful times during the year. Just checked on the web, replacements cost $50! Hope this is the exception. I don't know where the papers are so no warranty on this one. Who'd have thought of this? I didn't. Suggest you find something more durable instead.Thumb down!"
2,Crystal stick is better,I recommend the crystal stick over this spray as the spray just couldn't provide the same protection as the stick.
1,THANKS FOR CLARIFYING ABOUT THE QUANTITY,I was wondering myself whether 6 meant the quantity. Thanks for clarifying that. It IS deceptive as written.
2,Natural deodorant,"It is a great idea, but for me it just does not work. I know people who like it, but they must not do any exercising"
2,Doesn't work as well as others.,I used Le Crystal deodorant stone and it worked great I accidentally purchased this one because the names are so similar and it DOES NOT work well at all. I'm stinky by the end of the day even in winter weather. Get the one from France - Le Crystal.
4,Crystal Deodorant - good for sensitive skin/allergic conditions,"My husband has eczema. This deodorant was on the ""non-allergenic"" list provided by the dermatologist. It works without giving a rash or being irritating. It is a pump bottle and sprays on wet. When I use it, I need to fan my underarms to dry it. Hubby doesn't bother. It does not have anti-perspirant action.2 squirts usually does the trick. Sometimes the pump is a little clogged and needs a 3rd spritz. You can rinse off the sprayer to remove any clogging, though."
4,"Great product, seller not so much","The product is fantastic, I would highly recommend it to anyone who suffers with excessive persperation issues or B.O. It will eliminate both after a few days use. No kidding. However don't buy from this seller, mine arrived broken completely in half and I contacted the seller for a replacement and they would not return my calls."
3,If You're a fan of the game this book is worth it,"This book is a fairly easy read but it is packed with nuances and detail about baseball that only a true fan of the game will appreciate. It has some humor and also provides some insight into the life of a man who had to ""settle"" for being an umpire. The only thing really wrong with it is that it was poorly edited and some of the spelling and grammatical errors are annoying and obvious."
2,ok condition not good condition,"I am happy with the book but i would call the condition OK or fair, but not good as advertised."
1,kk,quite possibly the worst book that I have ever read. Johnathon Kiek has written a poor book which is of no use to the world. By reading it you lower your I Q
2,diverse with acountry/folk blues feel,"Recorded at a home studio, just the snipits on the web show diverse influences ranging from country to blues, folk to avantgard. Yeah, that rambles, but its' nice not to to get placed in a box."
2,Disappointed,"Only their two big hits are great on this rather expensive import--""Make it Easy on Yourself"" and ""The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore"". AND THEY ARE GOOD. Also, wish they had included some bio information inside."
2,A Big Let Down,"I started this novel with high hopes....expecting something better than some self proclaimed thrillers I had recently inflicted myself with, but it was not to be.The plot is simplistic and the protagonist blunders from one accident to another.He only manages to succeed in the end due to an unbeliveable set of good luck and stupidity on part of the villians.While reading the novel there was a strong sense of deja vu .... of having been there and done that, especially with respect to the character of Dr Hemlock.There is very little that is original or likable about him.In my opinion Ian Fleming wrote infinitely better novels of this genre, viz. spy thrillers, I have yet to come across any author with a better command over language and creator of more interesting characters than him.My search continues......"
3,Good fun,"If you want four hours of absolute escapism this is for you. Dr. Jonathan Hemlock, art historian, mountaineer and assassin returns. This time he is in London and is coerced into locating films of establishment figures taken in compromising positions with professional women. This will involve lots of killing and other fictional assassin type stuff.It total fantasy and not a cultural experience ,its a very violent James Bondish read but the writing is of a higher calibre.It does slip into total parody in parts and the language dates it but its the perfect airport book."
1,Disappointing,"After reading Eiger, I figured I would pick up the sequel. I guess I was hoping that it would be decent. It bored me to tears, and the characters were horrible.Shibumi was a great book, and The Eiger Sanction is worth reading, but I would advise you not to waste your time with this one."
3,ZZZ,"Big fan of Travanian, but this story takes too long to develop. If I cared about the characters I might have stayed with it, but I wasn't willing to invest the time."
3,A predictable storyline - poor sequel to Eiger Sanction,"While Eiger Sanction bore most of the characteristics of a good spy novel with fresh ideas, this sequel lacks the new thoughts and its storyline is rather predictable and built of stereotypal patterns. Most of the scenes bear strong resembance to other novels and films, such as Flemming. The ending is simply dull and schematic. The style and wit of Tevanian is first class but without the story behind it gets tedious and l'art pour l'art. Read LeCare if you're looking for spy novels at the best of the genre or read Shibumi for much better from Trevanian - probably the real sequel to Eiger Sanction."
5,Nice speakers,"This is a nice setup for a great price. The satellite speakers have a small footprint, but put out good sound for playing CDs or MP3s on your PC.Nice bass from the subwoofer too. The sound is comparable to a stereo system you'd pay a couple hundred bucks for. Unit is small and portable, so you could also hook up this system up to a portable CD player and take it out on the deck, etc.If you're trying to listen to music on the cheap, non-powered speakers that came with your PC, don't even hesitate. The difference is night and day."
3,"product is good, photo misleading","AAVs work beautifully if a lack of venting is your problem. The photos on Amazon of these products, including the competing Magic Vent by Rectorseal, can be misleading. This product under review, for example, states acccurately that it comes with an ABS adapter (ABS is black) but the photo shows a PVC adapter (PVC is white). A Magic Vent product accurately does not mention the adapter and indeed the product came without an adapter but the photo showed the product WITH an adapter. So read the descriptions carefully and do NOT go by the photos."
2,Blase and Ho-Hum,"A disappointment compared to the author's previous works. Less effort was apparent in story development and plot while the erotic aspects of the story were handled in a much more cook book fashion. The author also rushed through character development, again, a disappointment compared to previous work."
2,Boring... little to no character development,"this book held My attention for two chapters..maybe. There was a lack of character development.. the book jumps right into BDSM aspect. keeping the reader a stranger with the main character. The book is heavy on Male fantasy.. Two women bondage,etc... you can find a better read else where."
3,not well done,somehow the film did not tell the true story of what happened .did not find it interesting!
2,"Important, well made but unengaging","Spurred on by brilliant reviews here and the fact that this is a Polish film dealing with an important part of history I thought this film would be a winner.Instead I watched a well made film, with high production value but completely unengaging. Frankly I was bored.I can't really tell what is so wrong with it. The story just dragged on and on. I know my history well and this film added nothing to the experience.I watched it with a good friend equally interested in foreign war movies but for us it was quite a disappointment.Compared to such brilliant films as Der Untergang (Downfall), Ji jie hao (Assembly) and Tmavomodr svet (Dark Blue World) this film has very little to offer. My recommendation is you watch those instead."
3,"KATYN, by Andrzej Wajda","I have just received the DVD from Amazon.UK,this film still being frown upon by the french press authorities which, as everybody knows, are still controlled by the reds.Our first viewing of it(it will require some others before we can thoroughly understand the vision of the director) conveys the unpleasant impression of complete confusion and want of clarity. The habit of Mr wajda to shift all the time from a period or a group of characters to an other, added to the fact that the subtitles follow one another so rapidly, is extemely confusing. The impression of authenticity and horror, in my views, would have been better conveyed had the film been shot in black and white."
5,Numbing and Powerful,"This is a powerful film that leaves one with a great sense of loss. Wajda always wanted to make this film (his father was one of the many Polish officers murdered at Katyn) and I believe that in time it will be acknowledged as one of his masterpieces ranking alongside ""Kanal"" and ""Ashes and Diamonds"" (amongst others). The film doesn't just deal with the murder of the officers by the Soviets in 1940, but also with the experiences of the wives and children, themselves pursued or living in a limbo of uncertainty, and then the discovery (and exploitation) of the atrocity by the Nazis. The irony and injustice is piled on after ""liberation"" - when history is rewritten by the Communists. There are some poignant moments, the brutal butchery, like in a slaughterhouse, or the events around Christmas. This is a moving film that I cannot recommend highly enough."
5,Excellent!,"This movie is very well done, and acted, and the only fault I found, although I was looking for none, was the NKVD use of the Walther P.38 when executing the Polish officers. The Germans themselves were just starting production of this pistol in 1940, after the transition from the Walther HP. A very minor point. Saving the visuals and drama of the executions until the final moments of the film was most effective. The lies of the Soviet murders and cover-up continued for about 50 years. Please note that the Russians also murdered at the same time, any priests, lawyers, and professors, as well as anyone they considered capable of leading an insurrection. Poor buggers! Welcome to the Marxist Paradise."
5,He did it again!!,If you like music that will take you to another level then this is a CD for your collection. The pride of the CD is cut number ten that is labled Parade. It is about ten minutes in length and is totally engrossing. You will love it!!
1,Wow!!!!!!!!,"The producer, director, and actors should be prohibited from working in the movie industry for the rest of their lives. Complete waste of my hard earned ninety nine cents. If you are looking for a terrible film, I would suggest: Movie 43, Caddy Shack II or Ishtar."
4,Neat Lil Indie,"For a movie done on a shoe string budget, FURY is really quite impressive. The opening scenes and music pull you right in. The kid who plays ""Bud"" (Renell Edwards) is a natural, a young Eddie Murphy or Chris Rock. He's charismatic, the camera loves him, and he pretty much steals the show. Decent chills and thrills, and don't ask about the poor disabled kid in the wall."
5,Wonderful.,This should be a primer for all 18th century reenactors. What a wonderful building block!
4,Awesome Grooves,"This CD is absolutely AMAZING! All the songs sorta blend into one another. There are rewviews that say that this is bad, but in my opinion, IT IS A COMPLETE PLUS!!! Buy this CD for sure if you are looking for a great chillout CD!"
2,Needs refining,"Both Enigma and Delirium as well as others, have this particular formula down cold, Dagda however, need to do more work in this area. The same drum patterns throughout as well as a very overused and tired 'pan flute sampled' keyboard sound, make for a boring listening for me. Vocals should also be pushed back in the mix with this type of music, not to the front. I haven't heard any other releases by this band but this was not a good start."
3,"Good, though it's all been done before","I'll give it 3 stars for ""good"", not average or poor, but not great or increadible either. I noticed the sticker on this cd that compared it to Enigma and Deep Forest. Granted, it seems everyone is comparing themselves to Enigma these days in hopes of selling their cd but this album should appeal to many of their fans anyway whom also happen to like Celtic music, simply because of it's style.Overall, ""Celtic Trance"" has a dreamy and mystical sound *but* every song sounds almost the same on this album and and I have trouble distinguishing one track from the next.Neverless, give this cd a listen, buy it if you like Celtic music, and if you do, also check out albums by Stone Edge and Emer Kenny which in my opinion are both a little better than this."
4,Educational,"I think that this book has been very informative, the illustrations are hand drawn, photographs would have been better for some of the descriptions. Overall, I would recommend it."
4,A Reader in Western Virginia,"This is an excellent introduction to Irish Literature, to be read through or just sampled. The selections are long enough to help the reader to decide where they'd like to start in a large body of literature. The perfect textbook for Modern Irish Literature 110."
3,Disappointed,"Having made wide use of the HoC in China - an excellent work - I am sorely disappointed with the volume on Japan. It lacks a thorough review of so many areas. Perhaps I was spoiled by the excellent work on the China edition which covered history, art, science, culture - the whole broad gambit. One could do better with an general history of Christianity in Japan. The bibliographies were terrible - listing only the most basic works, if that. The sections on Protestantism is Japan were perhaps better. The area of the Catholic missions, the whole early history are, in my estimation, poor. Not worth the money I spent on the work. Insufficient at best.Fr. Joseph Lea, M.A., M.Div., M.A."
2,Not worth it,"This software seems like it was designed more for your desktop than your palm. On your desktop, it is a fully interactive map of the U.S. But you can only load a single still picture on to your palm. No zooming, no address finder, nothing!!! If you're looking for interactive map software for your palm, stay away. But not bad for your desktop."
1,Absolutely worthless,This software would have been a marvel twenty-five years ago. I couldn't return my copy fast enough. The details that they say are downloadable from the web are not there. Rather than Streets Maps & Vacation Planner buy a good old fashioned paper map. It is far better.
3,outhouse prints,"cute,easy to frame,colors could have been brighter,they should have sold two for five dollars,it would have been a better deal"
5,Great Grill,"This grill is made good,be careful on installing the warming rack but other then that it is well worth the money,and don't forget to season the grates before you cook on them."
3,No Surprise!!!!!,"I will not truly know how well this item will be until spring.......however, I rated this product a three because it was a Christmas gift which was suppose to arrive in an unmarked box. It didn't and of course who answered the door when it arrived almost two weeks before Christmas??? The person the gift was for, my husband. I could have and almost cried. This was suppose to be his big gift and it was ruined. Also, the box it came in looks pretty rough. I hope nothing is damaged.I hate to complain, but really??? Of all things to mess up on. I truly love Amazon though and will continue to buy from them. But if you have a big surpirse coming....make sure you are the one home to receive it. I wrote this review only because there was no where else for me to say what happened. For some reason everything else I bought would allow me to comment on the shipping, but not this grill. That was also very weird.Anyway, I hope it's wonderful when our weather warms up."
4,Many Parts,"I love the grill. The size is perfect as well as the shelves for holding tools and other grill related things. However, there were so many parts. The instructions were not the best. I had someone help me. If I had not had help, the grill would probably still be in parts all over my dining room!"
4,wrangler charcole grill,"very good charcoal grill,it took some time to break in but well worth the effort,and the flavor is better than gas!!!"
2,Shoulda listened....,"There are good things to be said. The weight is good, and the grates are excellent. The size is perfect. Unfortunately, I have to agree with an earlier reviewer who talked about execution. The machining on this thing is abysmal. I'm not a novice at putting these together; I've had three others, albeit from different companies. This was not pleasant. I had to chisel out holes that hadn't been punched properly. I had to force the barrel to fit on the frame; it was off by about 1/2"". Not surprisingly, nothing fits snugly. I know, you get what you pay for(which was more than what it is now listed for), but my Weber wasn't much more and it's still going strong after 10 years. I doubt I get 2 years with this."
1,Terrible just terrible,"Ok this is a terrible grill for charcoal grilling. You can't keep a nice consistent heat without constant adjustments to the vents, and adding charcoal. You have to have such a small fire that it will go out after 15 minutes just to keep a low enough temperature to not just instaburn the food which makes you have to add coal constantly to keep the fire from going out. I guess that's why the grill is made in 3 pieces so you can easily add fuel to the fire.Do not buy this POS. Save your money and just get an Ol' Smokey. Seriously, you'll be much happier."
3,"Great grill, though it is 435 sq in, not 640","It's a great grill, but the Amazon title is quite a bit misleading. The Wrangler has a cooking surface of 435in plus a 200sq in warming rack. You can't grill on a warming rack, and I think it's misleading for Amazon to call this a 640 sq in grill.That said I've owned this product for 2 years now and have been very happy with it otherwise. Great bang for the buck. My only other criticism is of the wheels, which are barely functional. You really don't want to rely on them to move the grill more than a few feet."
2,"Looked good, but I hope it lasts","I purchased this product from amazon . It looked good and solid and didn't take time to assemble. However, the blackness under the grill is peeling of due to heat. Its a great product, but I hope it lasts"
3,Its ok,I received my grill today and it is great except when I put it together I found out I am missing the damper circle that is needed.
2,cheap-I returned it,I'm not sure it was actually Calphalon-nowhere near the quality of the Calphalon items I have bought locally in dept stores.
5,Well worth the price.,"This is an excellent price for this product. The stainless steel knife is the best part of this set. I have bought numerous grilling sets in the past, and have never seen one offered with a cutting knife. The basting brush, knife, fork, slotted spatula, tongs, grill brush/scraper, skewers, corn holders are all very good quality. What else could you ask for in a barbeque grill set."

3,"Really, really up for it feel-good music","If house music prompts dancing and good times, Rob Boskamp really, really wants to make sure you enjoy yourself. Beyond the boundaries of feel-good glam and unapologetic disco, Groove 2001 keeps you smiling and smiling until your face begins to stretch. Heck, it practically hugs the speakers.Gliding through quality Latin cuts as the warm up certainly hits the right buttons. Club Fiesta ""La Fiesta"" remains an understated medal winner, followed hot on its heels with percussion blast-off ""Timbales"" by Mixmaster. Even an umpteenth variation of KC Flightt's heavily touted ""Voices"" fits within the puzzle.Taken over nineteen tracks, though, the long string of upfont, shiny tunes (and an enthusiastic revival of the male vocal) will challenge most listeners' threshold for happiness. Easy enough to take when dance-pop starlings ""Music All Over the World"" and ""I Feel For You"" drop by, but over an over for an hour...well, if you're up for it, it's certainly up for you."
5,Unbelieveable CD,Could not believe the quality of cd.This cd has so many #1 songs on it plus it has Safe in the arms of love before Martina McBride butchered it! Well worth the money.
3,What is Barbie coming to?!,"My daughter received this as a present from Santa at a Christmas party. The adults in the crowd were in disbelief - What is Barbie coming to!? A cat with a litter box? The packaging says""Marshmallow (the cat) drinks. . . and wets in the litter box. Scoop up the clumps after she goes."" My daughter does seem to enjoy it but I'm not explaining the litter box aspect of it and I am tossing the sand - I can only guess where it would all end up! Maybe I'm old fashioned - but I'm not impressed!"
3,Ditch the sand and it's not bad,"My 3 year old daughter received this from her uncle (not married, no kids) for her birthday. As soon as we opened the box, I saw the sand and grabbed it and threw it away. She has no idea that the kitty goes potty, so that's OK with us. She loves, however, playing with the kitty, the barbie and the box. So there you go. I didn't experience the mess that others had and boy and I glad I got rid of that sand - especiallyw ith having cream-colored carpets!"
3,NOT WORTH $...,We bought this for my little sister(age 4) and it was DEFINITLEY not worth it. The litter sand goes all over the place and leaks through the door. Plus it makes the worst mess any toy could make. The kitty is hard to squeeze to make it pee and the carry case is very easy to break apart sending sand all over the place. The barbie was very cute though (we actually got the brunnete) and marshmallow looked pretty cute too until she got sand all over her.Only if it is on sale buy it. This is worth [the money]for the barbie and then ditch litter box.
2,Wish it came with a vacuum cleaner!,"My 4 year old daughter just loves kittens and Barbie, so when this toy came out it was a ""must have."" I ""must have"" lost my mind when I bought it for her!The kitty kennel turns into a litter box by removing the lid and door. There are 3 packets of ""litter,"" which are really just colored sand. You make the kitty drink water from a bottle, then squeeze the kitty to make it ""pee"" in the litter box. This is where the mess begins. After just a few minutes of play, wet, clumpy pink and blue sand was everywhere! Despite prepping the area with several old bath towels, the sand made a huge mess. Even my daughter decided it wasn't as much fun as she originally thought it would be."
3,WHAT A MESS!,"My daughter begged for this toy and I foolishly purchased it. What a mess! Sand was everywhere and ""kitty"" either won't pee or she pees all over the place. Sand got in kitty's hair and feet and then all over my floor. About four pee's and the sand was all wet. Time for more sand! And it doesn't dry out terribly well, so I'm not even sure we can reuse it. Not such a bad thing, I think. I'd pass..."
3,I am only 11,This is not the best barbie but it is pretty cute the cat really uses the littter but you have to clean up after that and throw what litter away so you know blech
4,"Indispensable, but not infallible","This really is an indispensable book for anyone seriously interested in pottery as an art or profession. It contains lots of great information. It also contains some errors, most of which are little. Also, the rendition of the Chinese character for ""raku"" is ugly and missing a stroke. The title says this is a dictionary of materials and techniques - but it's more than that. It can serve as a jargon glossary, too. Also, some articles seem more concerned about meaning and interpretation and make practically no mention of materials or technique, and in the case of the ""Teapots"" entry, I thought it culturally-biased and incomplete. That said, get it anyway, this book is a must-have."
4,Potters Dict. Review,Could not find a problem or question that was not at least touched on in this book. That sentiment is shared by others that use this important and useful reference
1,Are the authors lazy or dishonest?,"This book is so filled with mistakes that it boggles the mind. Who did the fact checking? The authors claim that the modern Christian right got most of their ideas from Hitler! The authors are either totally ignorant of American history or so biased that they will not be honest. This book is easily the most incorrect and biased account I have ever read. While I share their dislike for the Right wing, their exagerations only make things worse. It could have been an interesting book, but they tried to stretch things too far."
1,Waves of Rancor=bitter resentment/ill will of radical left,"Waves of Rancor is an excellent 5-star book because it is a revealing example of intellectual irresponsibility, extreme left-wing propaganda, and dangerous hate-mongering. The authors appear as bitterly resentful and ill-willed in broadly condemning all conservative talk-show hosts such as Rush Limbaugh in attempting to indict truly extremist and dangerous right-wing voices. I heard Michael Keith on the Michael Medved talk-show add Dr. Laura Schlesinger to the conservatives he does not like. I doubt the authors even listen enough to Dr. Laura, much less to Limbaugh or Medved, to be experts on conservative talk-show programs. They have gone too far with their broad-brush ""paint job"" and have made the same mistake that Hillary Rodham Clinton made in her infamous comment about the ""vast right-wing conspiracy"". I strongly recommend the book as an example of the ""fascism"" of the current anti-democratic left-wing intellectuals."
1,Not worth the price.,Very cheap product. By the time it actually warms up the timer kicks off. It is also very thin and small. Would NOT recommend!
2,quit working after 1 week,"I received this as a gift, and then we went on vacation. I gently used it in the car while traveling, and it quit working within one week"
2,Very dissapointed,Really think and could feel the coild that run through the blanket. will not be giving as a gift as I wanted.
5,Test Strips Duds?,"I have always bought One Touch in the Blue box. I thought this box was blue, but when it arrived it was grey with a black strip along the bottom. OMG! Perhaps I am just addle brained, but they did not work in my meter. So I called One Touch Support Line. After going through different questions, and tests, the lady at the other end of the phone pronounced the strips faulty. So I went to the store and bought more expensive strips. They did not work either. I called the Support Line back. I got a different lady this time, who informed me that after all these years of testing, I somehow got confused and was putting the strips in backwards. Talk about embarrassed. These strips work just fine. In fact, they work just as fine as the more expensive ones in the blue box."
2,"Dates, dates , dates !","Expiration date is too soon. I had requested that they be about mid 2013 expiration. SO NOT SO a GOOD a ,EH !WAT'S A MATTA WIT YOUS GUYS ?"
5,outstanding!,"This book examines Vasarely's masterful course of development through the years. It is complex, interesting, and enriched with 22 black & white and 52 color reproductions showing the quality of his work. A wonderful addition to any artist's book collection."
1,Nice product but not as described.,"I recently ordered 3 of these based on the description, ""Our registers feature steel dampers which are powder coated after being cut to length so no exposed ends exist where rust can form. The dampers are then screwed to the solid cast brass cover so as to be removable for future maintenance if needed..."" However, these are merely faceplates and do not come with a damper, so do not offer the functionality as described.Otherwise, they appear to be decent quality and of solid construction. The faceplate is nicely polished. Of note, the actual outer dimension is 7 1/4"" W x 12 15/16"" L."
3,"1st generation ""biblical child training"" book",Bruce Ray was a Baptist Pastor who wrote this book several years ago. It is particularly wooden in its approach to discipline. Books by the Tripp brothers are far superior.This is one parents should pass on.
1,Concerned,"My husband (a pastor, and now my 'former' ) and I read this book when we were young, with young children. The author is sincere, but sincerely mis-led. It led us down a path I deeply regret. I earnestly ask prospective readers to keep looking for a book on child rearing. One cannot 'un-do' the efforts of early parenting."
1,A Glorified External Disc Reader,"I got this unit to take some of the strain off of my laptop's internal DVD writer and found that 80% of the DVDs I burnt with this unit were ruined. It might be due to the USB connection, but premium quality blanks and a slow writing speed didn't seem to help at all. I lost several VALUABLE presentation files because of the constant errors in writing from this unit. I didn't catch that the drive was responsible until I was backing some data up with a program that does a verification check and the software kept telling me that the just-burnt DVD had failed the check. This happened 23 times before I gave up and returned this paperweight.If you want a DVD reader that can make slow labels with Lightscribe, then this is for you. If you want a reliable WRITER unit, then go get an internal drive for a desktop."
5,Sex Ed 1861,"Written by a medical doctor and historian, ""Sex In The Civil War"" shows that our prudish Victorian ancestors really weren't so uptight after all...in fact, some things haven't changed that much. Sometimes hilarious and always informative, Dr. Lowry covers everything from bathroom invective to antebellum birth control using research gleaned from period medical texts, diaries, military records and of course the soldiers' letters home. An entertaining and educational look at the birds and the bees in the nineteenth century."
3,Incomplete though fairly interesting,"Most people have the ridiculous notion that somehow sex was different in the Civil war, more repressed, less open, less frequent and done in the dark under the covers with guilty consciences. A cursory examination of civil war literature and letters from the time will quickly dispel that notion.Lowry is to be admired for tackling this subject, but he really doesn't reveal anything new. There is much ""padding"" in this book, with unnecessary repetition and extraneous chapters which have little to do with sex.If you're interested in the sexual habits and mores of the time, it would be more instructive to consult marriage manuals of the period which are easily obtainable on the Internet. Lowry barely touches the surface and doesn't really explain much. Perhaps because the simple truth is that sex is sex, whether it's in 1860 or the year 2000."
1,"Uh-Oh, Spaghetti Oh...He's Been Caught","Just read today that the National Archives have discovered that Mr. Lowry changed an Abraham Lincoln document to make it look like that the last thing Lincoln did on 14 April 1865 (the day of his death) was pardon a soldier. Mr. Lowry told the Archives that he did it to essentially make himself important because he was the doscoverer of this amazing document. The statute of limitations have passed and Mr. Lowry will not be charged for desicrating and national document; however, this now puts everything Mr. Lowry has written under a microscope of suspicion. Now his work needs to be taken with a grain of salt. It's really sad when someonne sabotages themselves for a little bit of recognition."
3,Great research source,This book would make an excellent source for an author who writes about the Civil War era. It is very well documented and even includes some interesting photos. It would interest anyone who enjoys reading about the things that people didn't used to talk openly about.
3,The story the soldiers wouldn't tell: Sex in the Civil War,"This book is more than Civil War history, but also a social history of pre and post Civil War America. The chapters are a bit scattered, but the content is intriguing. Not neccessarily scholarly, but interesting history just the same."
4,"It wasn't all picket duty, huh?","Lowry offers a serious, yet oft times tongue-in-cheek look at the sexual behavior(s) of Civil War participants. From addresses of Washington area brothels, to medical examination forms, from excerpts from Walt Whitman's ""love diary"" to insights into the ""self-help"" manuals of the times, Lowry explores just about all aspects of sexuality during the era. Of course, some readers may be offended by the use of graphic language, but indeed, this IS a story about sex!"
1,Romero,The tape was an old Hollywood Video rental. The box was ripped and quality of the tape was bad. I was very disappointed!
5,Good Movie!,Thoroughly enjoyed this movie -- historical.Raul Julia was superb. Good movie to see at the present time in view of current problems protecting our freedom of religion and conscience rights.
4,Romero - Classic Movie,"""Romero"" is based on the life of Catholic Archbishop Oscar Romero of El Savador. He served in the 1970's when the country was going through very turbulent political times. The movie magnificently portrays Romero's inner conflict about the role of the Church in caring for the suffering of the ordinary people or remaining too closely aligned with the State. Romero's change to set himself against government corruption and become a ""man of the people"" was akin to a religious conversion experience which ultimately cost him his life. A beautiful and moving story and so well played by Raul Julia as Oscar Romero."
4,for class,"Interesting account of Oscar Romero. I used it to bring life to a study in class regarding politics in Guatemala, El Salvador, and other Spanish Speaking countries in Americas."
3,"So, so","Arrival of the movie, just in time. Quality of the movie so, so. Other than that, everythin pretty much ok."
4,inspirational,"as a theology student, as a citizen, and as a human being the movie touched me at every level. the transformation story of archbishop romero is not only about an individual hero but touches upon what it means for a church to have a human face. what role a church must play when caught between politics and violence. it is relevant to us today as we face a new global hegemony. the people around the world are being exploited in the name of capitalism and democracy. while, we, the fat americans stand by and watch in indifference the people suffering? some 2 billion people who makes less than a $1/day. will we rise up? will we open our eyes and to see the plight of the majority of humanity outside the boundaries of united states? who will speak for them? who will hear their cries?may i be as courageous as archbishop romero in speaking the truth and to confront the systems of power and indifference."
5,Story of a saint.,"Raul Julia carries the dramatic tension between, on the one hand, the taciturn scholar, reflective contemplative and fearful recluse and, on the other hand, a bishop with responsibility for his people, a prophet with a keen sense of human dignity and a man driven to his edge by the violence of his countrymen. His prescience about his impending death equals that of Martin Luther King."
5,Film plus novel,"The powerful film, Romero, always amazes my college classes. I use it to introduce Graciela Limón's novel, In Search of Bernabé. The two are perfect for each other."
5,VERY MOVING AND TOUCHING BIOGRAPHY!!,"AS WITH GANDHI, THIS IS A VERY MOVING MOVIE EXPERIENCE!YOU CAN'T HELP BUT TO BE TOUCHED AND IMPACTED IN SOME WAY AFTER WATCHING THIS FILM!RAUL JULIA GIVES THE BEST PERFORMANCE OF HIS CAREER!!DON'T PASS THIS ONE UP!!"
4,Heart wretching 3.5 out o four,"Raul Julia gives one of his finest performances ever in this biopic. I have seen many films and this is one that stays with you, and leaves a profound impact. It is a movie about a cardinal with seemingly infinite courage. He fought for the poor, but only through his words. He never resorted to violence, but pleaded for a peaceful resolve. This movie will upset you, and pehaps the plot is a little manipulative (getting you too ""pick"" a side early on) but it is also true. A film that should not be missed, as it is a film about perhaps one of the most unknown but important persons of the 20th century."
5,Another Opinion,I read the reviews before adding my own. I have no criticisms of the movie. The story needed to be told! Maybe it could have been done better; but I think its an excellent movie and an excellent parrable on what is expected of our Judeo/Christian/Muslim beliefs. Any one sho thinks it should have been done better should give it a try. We as a society living in ambivalence between a culture of life and one of death can use all the help we can get.
4,Great movie.,"Great movie. One special feature, a less than 5 min film made at the time of the movie which was good, but there could have been a lot more. Great story though."
5,the best!,"This CD has childhood memories for me. We always used to play this and dance together.... and now that my brother is gone, its just not the same. I just had to get this though, for my collection. A great CD for Rhumba lovers."
4,The Book of Learning and Forgetting,This is a great book that challenges everything we know in our educational system. A must read for educators and teachers to open the eyes to how we all learn.
4,Interesting Read,"Too often in education we get the standard viewpoint of the traditional education system. Whether you agree or disagree with the traditional approach, it is good to read an alternative viewpoint. There is plenty in this book to make you rethink the way you teach."
2,not sure what to make of this...,"Perhaps I would have enjoyed this book had I not recently finished ""We Regret to Inform You..."" (which I highly recommend). I had no sympathy for the female protagonist - found her immature, self-centered, naive - typical of the ""peace-keepers"" and ""humanitarians"" that Gourevitch describes, who have done so much more harm than good. Sarah Stone had an opportunity to enlighten and educate objectively, and it's a shame that she focused on a not very gripping romance instead."
1,painfully bad,This has the distinction of being the worst book I have read in at least the last year. A totally unrealistic love affair fills the pages with the most amazingly perfect animalistic yet spiritually connecting sex (totally unrealistic-I mean every single time!)while trivializing the difficulties between the Tutsis and Hutus.
4,Wonderful the first time...,"The first time I read this one (when I was about ten) I absolutely LOVED it - the way the adventure overtakes Tintin & Haddock so quickly, the Peruvian roads, the mystery and 'hiddeness'of the Inca temple, and the way it reached civilization only in rumours and whispers - but now I've found I've read it so much that the feelings have faded a bit; so, don't overdo it!"
5,WELL WORTH A READ.,"You can't go wrong with Tintin books. I bought most of the collection from Amazon, finding the others elsewhere. I wanted to get them before the new reissues came in, stimulated by the movie. I find the newer, multi-story versions too condensed to read with ease. The original bigger paperbacks really are the way to go. Sometimes the origninal just can't be beaten."
5,Great Explanation of the Science Behind the Seasons,We used this book to discuss the science behind season changes and Winter Solstice with our five year old and his homeschool coop group. The book does a fabulous job of putting concepts into language that kids understand without watering down the information too much. The pictures and diagrams are great for visual learners as well!
1,A Big Disappointment,"Me and my best friends loved the first Raisin book and had been waiting so long for the second one to come out, we were PSYCHED when it finally did. We got permission and had a sleep-over to read it together. But it wasn't the same. We kept waiting for it to be engaging and funny, but it just never happened. Since no one was having any fun, we all just gave up and watched videos. We were all very sad.Tami, 12Witchita Falls"
1,It wasn't too funny,"I liked the first book, Raisin looked cute on the cover. And the kissing scene was good in this book. But, overall, i didn't laugh like i did before. And parts went on and on and on.Sorry, just telling it like it is,Betty"
1,"Raisin in a rehashed ""rewritten"" character originally taken from Harriet the Spy","Harriet the Spy is basically re-written via this new character Rodriguez, in a book put out by a writer who once worked at the same company that put together the Opal Mehta book! So one has to question the reality of ""originality"" and ""borrowing"" at work here."
1,"Blah, Blah, Blah!!!","I absolutely love Zombie movies, but I have to say that this one was one of the stupidest ones I have seen to date! I looked at the reviews left by others and based my purchase on that... NEVER again!I thought I would laugh, I thought I would be grossed out! Boredom was the only thing I felt! This movie was 99 minutes too long! I am sorry that I bought it, I tried to give it to my nephew who also loves zombie movies and he said no way! He had seen it and did not like it either. If you don't expect good dialogue, good makeup or good anything, than this movie is for you. Otherwise, do not waste your time or your money!"
1,seriously,"All I really have to say is wow. I was pretty sure I was watching some high school students final film project, but then I was like nah, even that couldn't have been as bad as this, what ever this was. I wont bore you with the description of the movie cause everyone does that. All I can tell you is if you find it necassary somehow to watch this don't, trust me it isn't worth the time it will take out of your life."
4,Good Zombie Fun,"I enjoyed this movie. Not the best Zombie movie out there, but it is real stupid fun. The end song is so good and funny that it alone is worth the price of the movie."
3,retardead...a must have for the zombie aficiando!,"ok ok so retardead is NOT george romero, hell not even close my zombas! however...if...and i do mean if...you have ever wondered...hey what would happen if a zombie bit a retard? well ask no more my brethern zombie collectors, now you can find out! it actually is a passable zombie movie for 5 guys and ten thousand dollar budget. some good laughs. some good stuff, a couple special effects i hadn't seen before, and for the price, EVERY zombie master collection should have it! i give it 3 stars out of 5, but hey it is low budget. I would go so far as to say 3.5 stars ok. so if you like the zombie movie genre, and are tired of getting ripped off for bad bad movies, buy this one. it only sux a bit! your friend, zombieboy 2009! (i would also recommend ""special dead"" for those interested in this genre)."
4,bloody funny movie,One of the funniest zombie flicks ever made.Has a few minor technical flaws but excellent considering the budget.Dan West and Rick Popko lighten up this genre with thier great sense of humor.And i'm not saying this only because I and a couple of friends were among the ZOMBIE HORDE in the great climax of the movie!DeWayne
1,A complete waste of time.,"This amateurish production is supposed to be funny ha ha, but it isn't at all. A one-note story with very little to walk away with makes this an infuriatingly bad piece of work from the first frame to the end credits.Not funny, not scary, just lame...unless you think grown men saying poo poo, pee pee, caca is funny."
4,So Retarded That It's Awesome!,"Retardead is a zombie-comedy, and I must say that it is the most entertaining zombie film that I've seen since Zombieland. Sure, it's stupid, uneven, and pretty much has no zombies for the first half of the movie. But the second half of the movie is nearly great, with a ton of gore, lots of zombies, and dumb comedy that's also funny. And I'm baffled by the people who gave this a one star rating. I guess they went into a movie called ""Retardead"" expecting it to be high-caliber or something."
4,Dead just got a little dumberer,"MONSTURD flushed, now the town must contend with some ""special"" zombies.This sequel is stupid-awesome!The evil Dr. Stern escaped a messy death from the most brutal bowel movement to ever leave skid marks in the road. Now he continues his horrible research, using the mentally-challenged as his guinea pigs.Think DAWN OF THE DEAD meets GOOD WILL HUNTING, with a super lowbrow humor and an even lower budget. Due to the effects of the hyper-intelligent serum, these slow people get smart and then get zombified?! Uhhh, all righty then...it might not make a lick of sense, but it's one heck of a fun time. Let the blood bath begin...GREATEST. GORIEST. ENDING. EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!4.5 STARS (Let's hope for a trilogy!)"
1,Absolutely Retarded,This was one of the worst Zombie Movies I have ever watched. The Acting as well as the make-up. But for low budget under 1 million I guess it was not bad. At least it had a semi-plot to it. I would not recommend buying it.
5,RBTI starter book,Excellent book to begin an understanding of RBTI. Great information as well as case studies. May be hard for some to understand and/or accept but all truth.
1,WRONG INFORMATION FOR THIS PART,"The AMAZON compatibility list for this part is WRONG. This part WILL NOT WORK in a Compaq Presario 5140, per technical support at Viking. Now I must return the part (after taking my PC apart 2 times), pay postage to return the part, wait for the correct item, and take my PC apart again! This is really POOR service from AMAZON. Also technical support IS NOT VALID 24/7 as indicated by AMAZON. This lack of providing the crucial information is very frustrating, considering that I have always received excellent service for AMAZON"
1,Made my performance worse!,"I have a Compaq Presario 5610 to which added this memory. I bought 3 128mb Memory Chips, which should have made my performance much faster since I only had 96mb before I upgraded. These chips made my performance worse, and I have since taken them out after comparing performance with the previous chips. I would not recommend this product if you have the same model of computer that I have. I am very disappointed, and out over $100."
4,it works,"It works but be prepared for poor documentation (NONE) and no drivers for the mac at all. It simply works, you have to manually go into your setting within the game and configure it but eventually you will have fun with it.It is the only Good wheel for a mac though."
4,A greatest hits collection of Eddie's 1980-87 work.,"This is really a greatest hits collection that includes tracks from (mostly) Eddie's 1984 and 1985 releases ""Palo Pa' Rumba"" and ""Solito"". This is a nice compilation but you'll be better off buying those two CDs (which are indispensable for any serious salsa CD library)."
5,Perfect for My Use,"I bought this off Ebay for $60.00 and I couldn't be happier with it.I am running it @ 4ohms X 100W, powering my Klipsch Forte's formy DJ Rig.Plenty of beef to rattle the house. In fact it was wayyyy loudat 1/2. 1/4 volume is still very loud and looks like it will bemy normal listening volume.I don't know about the units other features, but as far as my usagegoes I'm stoked."
5,Lead Me To The Rock--The Blessed Hope Project,Lead Me To The Rock recording is a blessing to myself & my wife as we play it frequently. It helps us get our minds off of our daily worries & toward the Lord. I would recommend this recording to anyone who would like to hear excellent Christian music.
5,Exellent Praise music!,"I was blessed by this CD. Lots of different styles of music, all songs scripturally sound, and 100% edifying. I would recommend this CD to everyone from the serious musician to the casual listener. Good for singing along or just listening. A great gift for someone to give a non-believer as an ""Ice-Breaker""; a way to open the door for sharing the faith."
3,Not her best but not her worst,"I am glad that I read this book even though it got terrible reviews. While I do not think this is J.L. best book, I do not think it is that bad either. I read it in less than a day. It is a light read. I do have to admit that the twin ""Amanda"" is extremely annoying and too much emphasis is put on her throughout the book. With that being said, if you are J.L. fan I suggest reading his book, regardless of the reviews."
3,"Good, but could have been better!","The storyline is great and had so much potential; however, the characters and story are disjointed and undeveloped. Sadly, it only rates a three."
3,"Not bad, not good","I certainly will never give Johanna lindsey less than three stars,but I was sorely tempted to on this one. All in all, this was not a horrible book, it just had way too much thinking and not a lot of doing on the characters parts. The two lead characters should have had a lot more interaction together for me to honestly believe that they could fall in love. Rarely did they speak to each other in this novel, and when they did, they didn't seem to click together. Passion was lacking, and so was all emotion other than confusion over whether the hero knew who he was dealing with...the good twin or the mean twin. Still, I read this novel in one sitting so it did have some redeeming qualities. However, I would much rather read her regency novels on the Mallory's or her earlier works set in medieval times."
3,not bad,"First off the good points of the story: 1. It has a solid story and the supporting characters you learn to care about. 2. It is a nice romance 3. It has its unexpected twists. Bad points: 1. The whole good twin bad twin thing...wasn't realistic. 2. The heroine was annoying (I mean hiding your beauty so your sister won't get jealous? Come on""In conclusion it was an easy read and fairly good. This is my first book by this author and I'm sure its not her best but I would recommend one to read this book."
2,"Bland, disappointing","I've been a fan of Johanna Lindsey for many years, but this isn't one of her best books. The plot is weak and wanders frequently. There is a great amount of repetition, also. It's almost as if Ms. Lindsey experienced writer's block and chose repetition as a way to help her add more pages.The characters and the dialogue were terribly dull and simplistic, as well. The book reads as if it was written by an entirely different author. What happened, Johanna?If you must read this novel, take the advice of a previous reviewer and borrow it from the library. Don't waste your hard-earned money."
1,Save your money...,"I can't believe I wasted $18 buying this book. I've been a Johanna Lindsey fan for many years & this is truly her worse book yet - it was complete rubbish. The characters lacked personality & I found it impossible to ""connect"" with the main character, Marian at all - it was a very unconvincing story. It lacked humour, romance & the storyline just dropped out about a third of the way through. It was such a bad attempt, I'd put the book down for days until I could stomach reading another chapter or two. Honestly, if you're considering buying this - don't! Save your money - borrow it from the library or something. I certainly won't be buying anymore of her books again."
4,"Okay, who wrote this book??","Maybe JL reviewed it and made some changes, but I doubt that she wrote it. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but not ""JL good."" If this was any other author I probably would have given it 5 stars, but I have read all JL's book and know what she is capable of writing.A few of the reasons I didn't give it 5 stars is as follows:1) The stable scene -- what happened? I'm still not sure. It was so abrupt. Absolutely no sexual tension to lead up to such an interlude; 2) When Chad and Marian admitted they loved each other, I was actually in shock. When did it happen? I actually flipped back through the pages to see what I had missed; 3) Where's the dialogue? We actually got to know them through their thoughts!!The end was very, very good. That's why I gave it 4 stars. Overall, I would recommend this book (in paperback). It was good."
1,A stinker,"I read about 230 pages of the book (in one sitting) and couldn't finish. Took it back to the library. This book was a rush job and I can't believe Johanna Lindsey, of all people, put her name on this!Don't worry we still love you Johanna! Crank out some more Malory books and I'll be happy as a pig in slop :)"
1,This must have been written by Johanna 's no talent twin!!,"I am a serious Johanna Lindsey fan and bought this book at the grocery store instead of my usual way - via Amazon. It is too bad I was not able to see the reviews beforehand. What a poorly written work and a barely plausible story. I am so disapointed in Ms. Lindsey. There must be something else happening here that we don't know about. Was she rushed through this by her publisher? Has she gambled away her writers fortune and desperately needed a quick influx of cash? Was somebody holding her first born captive while they forced her to write this? Who knows? I do know that you should not buy this book - it is a complete waste of money. However, don't ignore Lindsey. Her other efforts are nothing less than amazing! Come back, Johanna!! We'll pay for the little ones ransom!!"
4,A Man to Call My Own,"Not sure why this got such bad reviews. It was a good story and had good characters. The sex was kinda sudden, but not the attraction. They were already building some what of an attraction, by little things. He didn't just jump from Amanda to Marion. Chad had already figured out that Amanda was not nice, and seen thru Marion's disguise. He was pretty sure it was Marion he kissed that night, not Amanda. Marion had also pretty much already told him why she acted and dressed like she did, when they briefly talked that night at the campfire. Anyway I like the story."
1,wouldn't dare to call my own,"First off, I don't understand why Marian would have to ugly down. Her ""Amanda ALWAYS WINS"" attitude made me want to scream. All she had to do was let her personality outshine Amanda's and stand up for herself. Then she'd never want for a friend or suitor. The man was pretty thick and not the least bit attractive. Basically you got a whole lot of boring people feeling sorry for themselves, then you get a lot of this boring stuff repeating itself, and then something somewhat exciting tries to happen but it only makes it feel random and downright unnecessary. The hero and the heroine (if you want to call them that) went from hating each other to making out, to bickering to rolling around in a barn, to ignoring each other to sucking each other's faces, to fighting to getting engaged. It became too much to keep up with. Is this the same Johanna Lindsey who wrote about that loving scoundrel, Jeremy Malory?!?"
2,Too Repetitive: Thumbs down for this one.,"The book is entertaining enough, but not very good. It is very repetitive, with the same things being stated over and over. It does not move fast, and is boring in places. Too much jumping to conclusions by the characters, even more than usual in a romance. This is just another cookie-cutter book. Nothing special. Sorry Johanna."
1,A complete waste of time...,"Reading this book was a COMPLETE waste of time. What is going on? This book was in no way lived up to the caliber of Johanna's writing. The development of the story did not develop and I kept thinking that she wrote this to make a quick buck or to appease the publisher the entire way through. Luckily I bought this in paperback, if I had bought it in hard back I would want some of my money back. Johanna what is up with your writing lately?"
1,WILL THE REAL JOHANNA LINDSEY PLEASE STAND UP?!?!?,"... What happened? What is really going on? I have read all of Johanna Lindsey's book and I have not been this disappointed since ""The Pursuit"". This book was so slow and when it got to the end, I was left hanging. On an average if the book is good I can read it in under four hours. This book took me 3 days and the only reason i keep reading it is because I paid [$$$] for it. Johanna Lindsey is a great writer, I just think her publishing company is hold her back from the same writing style as the Johanna of old.To see her earlier more creative work? Read Fires of Winters. This book is a Johanna classic"
3,Wish I hadn't paid for a hardcover!!,"Gosh,What happened to my fav Johanna ?? Has she lost her scruples and morals for her characters ?..I really was not sympathetic to Marion, she was such a tattle and in a sneaky and underhanded ""I'm concerned"" type of way (I call that passive aggression) Also her I'm the ""ugly"" twin role-playing was lost on me and went on too long. As to the stable ""lovin"" she got... what was that ? Good Heavens. At this point I quit reading and frankly didn't even finish the book.Sorry I coundn't be more positive but I was disappointed."
5,LOVED IT!!,I absolutely loved this book! I am a huge fan of Johanna Lindsey and she does it again with this book!!! I recommend this book to anyone who likes a light romance with some hot scenes included but also if you are like me and love those Cowboys then this is the book for you!!!
2,Could have been a whole lot better...,"My review is going to be right in there with everyone elses. There have been times that I read reviews and then read the book and wondered if they read the same thing I did. But this time I have to agree with others. I did finish the book but it was just ok. The characters aren't well developed. I got tired of the twin Amanda being so hateful and whinny. Why couldn't the other characters see past Marian wearing the thick glasses for disquise and being bullied by Amanda. There was too much repetition in phrases through out the book. The story was slow moving- I skipped pages really bad just to get through it and when I did I didn't miss anything. Sorry, but I won't recommend reading it- too many other good ones out there."
1,"It's ""I couldn't care less!""","This book was dissapointing on so many levels. First of all, the editing. JL used the phrase ""I could care less"" at least 15 times. The correct phrase is ""I couldn't care less""It drove me nuts. That along with the slowest moving story. There was no real conflict. I agree with the other reviewers, how did the barn scene happen? Where was the tension, the emotion? Why not show Amanda's pain? Obviously she had some, she mentioned it twice to Chad.I thought the end was awful too. Where did that come from? Everyone just took the information and moved on.I loved JL, she wrote with feeling. I am not sure who wrote this book."
3,Ehhh....Okay,"While I love Johanna Lindsey's earlier works, this as most of her recent books fell flat. Ms. Lindsey spent too much time in the beginnig telling us how rotten Amanda was and to what lengths Marion hid her beauty. I think Ms. Lindsey rushed to get us to the hero/heroine conflict. She elaborates on Marions distrust of Chad's attentions toward her sister then BOOM! Their doin' it in the stables. Then follows the trite misunderstandings and unspoken secrets that could clear everthing up. If you want to read a novel that exhibits why Ms. Lindsey is a best selling author, I would suggest ""Man of My Dreams""."
1,Don't Waste Your Time and Money!,"I never thought I would ever give a Johanna Lindsey book so low a rating; however, this book is garbage. How many times do we have to read about a good twin and a bad twin? This book is full of flat, undeveloped characters, and the most predictable storylines. Quite honestly, I haven't liked much of Johanna Lindsey's books since the 90's. I can't help but think that she needs to focus on the quality of her writing rather than the quantity. Her latest books appear to be rushed out in a manufactured style of writing."
2,What happened?,"This is the first Johanna Lindsay book I've bought in at least five years. Not that I didn't like her earlier works, I just grew away from them. A friend of mine is a devoted fan and I thought ""OK I'll give her try again"". The cover is gorgeous, the story sounded good but was a HUGE letdown. The sex scene in the barn was great ;-) but Marion just came off as silly and a little childish and her sister as a witch....Neither were really redeaming--the best part was Chad (and his dad!) I never finished it and told my friend to save her money for the paperback :-("
1,Waste. Weak. Worthless. Save your money!,"Thought it would be nice to have... it is not. Too weak to hold up a heavy camera. Too difficult to adjust. Too flimsy to trust your camera too. Might as well use a real monopod or tripod instead. This was a waste of my money. Maybe it will work for you, but it is not working out for me."
2,Too Tiny A Tripod For Me!,"I really wouldn't recommend using this tripod with anything other than the smallest and lightest of digital cameras! It is just so small a thing! Too small for me!Also, pulling out the leg extensions (on mine) is dreadfully difficult! Too tight! It is difficult for me to get good enough a grip on them with my fingertips!Conclusion:If you have a tiny lightweight camera to use with this tiny tripod, it 'might' be acceptable to you."
3,Mini Tripod Review,"This is miniature tripod that's really compact, slips in your pocket. It therefore is a compromise between function and portability. If you've had problems balancing your camera on a rock or log, this will help. If you want something that has more functions, get something bigger."
2,Unimpressive,"Maybe OK if you have a small camera, but it's too flimsy to support an SLR. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing (it's small after all), butVanguard VS41 Flexible MiniTripodis at least as cheap and is sturdy enough to do the job (plus, it's better looking in my opinion)."
4,You get what you pay for...,"The tripod is very small and light, the materials used to make it are somewhat sturdy. Be careful not to pull too hard when extending the legs, as it could come apart. I am taking it on a long trip to Europe and plan to use it a lot. My Canon Powershot ELPH fits perfectly on it because they are similar in size. If your looking for a polished and professional grade travel tripod...move on. This one is definantly made for amature photographers like myself on the go."
3,Extremely small,"This item is very small. I coudn't believe how small it was when it came in the mail. Be careful when mounting an SLR camera, tends to tip over if not careful. Will work fine for point and shoot cameras. Still not sure where the ""Extendable"" wording came from"
3,"Works fine with small, travel cameras","First of all, this tripod has the feel and look of a cheaply made, imported item - that's why I give it 3 stars. I realize you get what you pay for - but hey, it's still cheap product.The legs do not extend - but they seem sturdy and firmly stay in place when unfolded. There is one tightening screw that controls the amount of pivoting and adjustment you can make. The tripod takes up a relatively small amount of space when folded up - roughly 1 3/4"" at is widest point by 4 1/2"".Warning! Don't be foolish and attach anything bigger than a compact camera, or a camera that was designed for travel (I experimented). The reason is the tripod's footprint is too small - if you put a camera w/ a detachable lens or a camcorder atop this pipsqueak the center of gravity will be too high and it will tip over easily - there goes your big $$ investment, all because of a $7 tripod."
1,Poor with D70,"If you like to take pictures of the ground with your Nikon D70, including possibly the tips of the tripod if you are in wide angle, this is the tripod for you. With a 24-120 zoom lens, it is almost impossible to tighten the ball up to the point that it will hold. At the point you think it might hold, you are sure you'll break the tightening knob (using a Leatherman). I think I got it; I think I got it; Don't got it. Probably fine for a point and shoot."
5,Tiny and Terrific,"This tripod does exactly what I wanted a tripod to do: It holds my camera in position so that I can set the timer and finally be in the photos. At last! Now there will be proof that I (the shutterbug) was on the vacation also! It is small and flat, and fits into the zippered pocket inside the top of my camera bag.It holds a Kodak DX6490 digital camera with no problems, and it is quick and easy to set up."
1,Cheap Tripod,"I mistakenly ordered this because I thought I could extend the length of the legs. This tripod is a loser, any camera with a little weight to it makes it top-heavy and it falls over. If you're going to buy a mini tripod make sure the legs extend to a full foot in length. I have one of those and thats what I had meant to buy for my second camera setup. I made a $10 mistake."
3,pretty interesting,"Interesting peek into a subculture. Good not great. But here's something that did grate (heh): The Wall Street desi hanging out with the main characters and being flashy with cash etc. and in his dialogue he keeps saying ""the apple"" when referring to the scene in NYC. The Apple? Nah. No one from here would say that. That's what a Brit boy (the writer) would THINK a wannabe fly banker dude would say. The Apple? No way."
1,crap innit,"If you are a typical sheeple who loves senseless violence, the type of obvious coolness that can only be had by wearing crisp clothing with the latest ridiculous label on, racism, objectification of women, intolerable narcissism, weak plots and inane dialogue, this book is for you! If you are a sensible and ethical person, you might be so offended by this piece of crap that you actually rip it into pieces and recycle it (which is against all of your instincts as a lover of books) instead of dropping it off at Goodwill so that no young minds might become polluted by it. If you are a person of true moral conscience you will probably be incensed enough to drive back to the bookstore and buy all of the copies from the dollar bin to insure that these meet the same fate."
2,"Promising, but negated by an embarassing ending","Londonstani starts out great, with a realistic (realistic-feeling to an outsider, anyway) look at a newly-affluent youth culture getting in trouble in London, along the lines of Quadrophenia or Absolute Beginners (the baddie is a desi Vendice Partners). The first half is great and original, with dialogue reminiscent of The Committments, and the plot thickens nicely, but by the end it dissolves into Scarface cliches and a crying-in-a-rainy-cemetery scene. In the last couple chapters, the plot gets less and less realistic (a typical situation where anyone but a fictional character would just leave town, commit suicide, or go to the police) but still holds together well, and the book would get four stars if it wasn't completely ruined by a cheap, irrelevant M. Night Shamalayn surprise-ending in the last couple pages that negates the signifigance of the rest of the story."
2,Disappointing,"This is a difficult read because it is written the way modern urban youth speak, or rather text message. Substantively, this book is akin to A Clockwork Orange. However, this book will never achieve the imaginative and literary heights of Burgess' creation. The conclusion will disappoint most readers."
5,Great CD from an outstanding series,"The beauty of this compilation is the wide range of atist and song.If it was a hit in the fifties for RCA then it is here, or on volume 1.The Nipper series is perhaps unique in this respect and that is what gives the whle series it graet strength.Often, even when you do not recognise a track from the name on the play list when it comes out of the CD you think ""ahh that one"".This is even true fr the 1920's and 30's compilations in the series.Very entertaining and great value for money the whole set is very well worth owning and you will definitly come across much material not found elsewhere.sound quality is also excellent."
4,Nipper's Greatest Hits: The 50's Vol 2,"I have this cd in my collection. I think is a great collection of the 50's hits, although I was hoping for more early Rock & Roll. But then again, RCA wasn't really a R & R label. The only major rock star to record for RCA was Elvis Presley. I enjoyed Canadian Sunset, Mama Look a Boo Boo, and Shout thoroughly, and of course Don't Be Cruel. I would like to see a Nipper's Great Hits of the 80's."
5,"Be Real, Be Free, Be Love.","Richard West and Jeremy Jones were definately on to something when they made this piece. it's an ""emotional piece of electronica"" as they described in the cd booklet. this album takes you to new levels of emotional awareness. I found it very soothing and relaxing, great after a long hard day. this shamanic piece is not to be missed! ""Be Real, Be Free, Be Love."""
4,concrete shoes and plastic bag helmets,"this by far isn't Dillinger's greatest release. But if any of you don't consiter their full length Calculating Infinity to be one of, if not the best hardcore/metal album at all time, than you have some serious problems. Of course DEP is not for everybody. They are much faster, heavier, more technical and pissed off than your everyday hardcore bands like Atreyu, Poison the Well, Recover, and From Autumn to Ashes. Don't get me wrong, they are all great bands, but DEP is something else. You will either hate it or love it. but dillinger has several things you could look for, amazing drumming, pissed off (screaming only) vocals, and amazing guitars (i'd be very suprised if anyone who says dillinger's guitars are crap could actually back it up by playing anything better)in a nutshell, i would recommend anything by DEP, but if you havent heard anything by DEP, please get Calculating Infinity instead.buy dillinger, slam to dillinger. shut up."
4,"decent buy, supporting excellent local scene","well, i'm glad i have the chance to take the virginity of this cd review. as for the cd, and that is why i am here, well, dep (dillinger escape plan 'natch) is a pretty tight band, and is for anyone intrested in intense, emotional (well, that depends if your idea of emotion is screaming, i mean, mine is at least) powerful music. basically, dep are hardcore, but you could also say they are grindcore. the thing about this cd that makes it so awesome is the fact that these guys have some talent, as opposed to many a hardcore band that just wing it. like they are ""trashing"" or whatever all hardcore style and then they bust into a quasi jazz style breakdown. i mean, it's not your father's jazz and what not, but if you listen, you'll hear what i am talking about. anyhow, buy this cd, it has flair, it has anger, you can be totally legit, i mean, how cool is liking korn rite about now. why front when you can all indie with this cd."
4,If John Coltrane came back as a metal band...,"This is what he'd sound like.This is not your daddy's ""heavy metal"" and is NOT for eveyrone. Proceed with caution and if they appeal to you you will be astonished.I just saw them live and they can actually pull it off onstage."
5,spoons in your eyes,"the sound of satan's answering machine, excluding the beep. so beautiful it makes me want to weep. if i'd had this album when i was 12, i'd be a congressman by now."
1,this sux,"this band is not technical, talented, heavy, or even halfway decent....this bands 'music', and im using the word music VERY loosely here, has NO MUSICAL DIRECTION WHATSOEVER. musical chaos is one thing(see nething by emperor after IXequilibrium) but sh*t like this is not chaotic...its just bad. these guys just throw together bad guitar/bass/drums and have some idiot scream over it(badly as well), and it doesnt work at all. i hate evrything about the entire 'hardcore/post-emo' style of 'music'(used loosely again). 0 stars"
5,The ultimate art rock band,"How incredibly great to hear this album again after all these years. And on a decent stereo this time around! The music sounds incredible, this is the mother lode -- this album is fantastic, perfect, powerful, creative, beautifully produced and makes you dance around the room AND think. Maximum acceleration...Ultravox ought to be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. And by that I mean the ONLY version of Ultravox worth listening to, that being the John Foxx era. Incredible music. Literally perfect. You have a heard a thousand excretable imitations of this music. This is the real thing, the source of the Nile, a piece of the True Cross.Taut, focused, experimental. It just doesn't get better than this. Truly original and creative. Early Roxy Music and the all-too-brief John Foxx era of Ultravox bookend the 70s. Undeservedly unknown. You must hear this."
4,A really good album,"This album is exceptional - it was ahead of its time in use of the electronic medium. Compare it to Ultravox's earlier effort ""Ha Ha Ha"" which had some wonderful ambient sections to it but was much more hard-edged. ""Slow Motion"" and ""Quiet Man"" are two songs that could be classified as New Wave rather that punk, and New Wave is what I'd call the record as a whole. Not that classifications like that are really all that accurate, but it does show the band's move away from aggressive, bare-bones post-punk."
4,memories,"Simply a classic. Had to get it on CD as a necessity to a collection. This was the type of synth rock we used to wish was on MTV. ""Dislocation"" and ""Just For A Moment"" are two of the best songs ever written and recorded. If you are an old Tubeway Army fan like me you will love this CD."
2,There's a demon under every rock....,"Standing alone, a group of like-minded people working together to solve a commonly perceived problem does not a conspiracy make; recognition that ours is a global community with problems that require global solutions hardly requires an epiphany. Samantha does make a better case than most authors of this genre, but I don't think there is a case to be made.One can only hope that Samantha finally turns her attention toward more pressing problems within the Christian community."
1,A far fetched idea that hurts real environmentalism...,"The idea behind environmentalism is caring for the environment, the same is true for Paganism, but that doesn't mean that either carries the other's agenda. Christianity promotes ""the Golden Rule"", does that mean that IT is politically oriented and we should stop it? This book completely ignores the fact that a good idea is a good idea, no matter what other things are associated with it. Think again before you take this book seriously!"
3,"Okay, but..","This book was okay, but not one of my favorites. While I did enjoy some of the suspense (the cliff scene being my favorite) I found it similar to the movie Meet Joe Black and kind of... um... trite? Josh's character was very unbelievable. Of course, the story wasn't meant to be believable, and I realize it ran down the romance-novel vein, but I expected it to be a bit more like her other book, Beauty Sleep, which I thoroughly enjoyed, or like Meg Cabot's Mediator series. I was sadly disappointed. But if you're into the whole all-romance-and-talk-not-a-lot-of-action thing, you'd like it.Also Suggest: Midnight Secrets series, Mediator series, Companions of the Night"
4,Pretty good mold,"I wanted to make Easter eggs using melted chocolate, so I bought this mold. They only drawback is that I wanted a 3D egg so I had to ""glue"" the chocolate eggs together once they were solid...that was tricky. All in all....the mold worked and gave me a beautiful egg!"
4,Worked as expected,"Works perfectly. Gives me two extra powered USB ports.The actual product received was a little different. The picture shows one large connector. The product has two smaller separate ones, but it fits in same space that the large connector would have."
4,pretty choice,These earrings are very attractive. They sparkle! Also they go with both gold and silver jewelry as both colors are in the earrings.
5,Perfect gift,I bought this as a gift for a friend going into boot camp. I then had all of our friends sign it telling him they were praying for him. It was better than i could have asked for. Its a beautiful bible.
5,"Handsome bible, great value","This is a very handsome leather bible series. Each bible contains the excellent (because it is very accurate and highly readable) Holman's Christian Standard translation. Special helps, prayers, and encouragements for policemen, firemen, and armed forces personnel are contained in each bible. The insignia or symbol of each occupation is nicely printed on the cover. It is sad that due to another religion (guess which one?) we now have a large market for bibles for the swelling ranks of the armed forces fighting the cruel and barbaric methods of those dedicated to violence in the name of their god. Onward, Christian Soldiers - and take a copy of one of these great bibles."
1,Not a Catholic bible,"Although this bible has many wonderful features, Catholics should be aware that this bible is NOT A CATHOLIC translation and is missing the 7 books that protestants removed during the reformation. Also, some of the supplemental material is not in line with the teaching of the magesterium of the Catholic Church. Buyer beware...48% of the Marines are Catholic and we don't want them being deceived by this non Catholic bible."
3,Old and New,"I have to admit, I was hoping this book would cover far more new ground than it did. The worst thing I can say about the body of this book is that it simply reclycled most of what Louise Hay already covered in her two books, You Can Heal Your Life and The Power is Within You. That said, the premise of this book, even though science hasn't yet been able to fully explain the practical ""how,"" of how energy is transmuted into the ""matter,"" of objective experience, makes it an invaluable read. For anyone who has moved beyond the cultural mythology of religion and is looking for a Cosmic explanation of why prayer works, this is the book for you. The in depth introduction to Quantum physics and it's connection to the realm of possibility is a fascinating read. It can help to claify confused, unfocused thinking and set you in the direction of being able to co-create with this brilliant, creative Cosmic Mind the life of your dreams."
5,Powerful Book,Spend the few bucks to gain insights that we all know but sometimes forget. This was worth the investment of time to read and a few dollars. Great sage advice written in clear and non-dreamy language
4,Basic But good,"This is an engaging primer on manifestation and the law of attraction. the first section deals with quantum physics and suggests that science supports the metaphysical program offered in later sections. The book provides a program to assist in the manifestation of goals and desires.While there is nothing new here, it is nicely written and accessible. I liked the fact that the third and final section of the book actually provided an outline of basic steps to manifestation with some helpful examples. It would be nice if authors would put in new stories as opposed to relying on the same, old, tired vignettes. This book provides a nice review of the Science of Mind principles for advanced students. Perhaps more importantly, it provides a solid foundation for beginners."
5,Progressive spiritulity,"If you tried Science of Mind, but got lost in the terminology, Shortcut to a Miracle might be for you.Recommended."
5,What a miracle!,"After reading this book, it's really good to know that we can change our lives for the better, as well as be able to create our miracles at will. To have this book being introduced to me is already a miracle in itself! Highly recommended!"
1,Does NOT work with Olympus D-520 as advertised!!!,"I ordered this and picked up at my local Circuit City store. As I left the store I looked at the item and noticed my model wasn't listed. I went back into the store and spoke w/ the salesperson. She looked at my paperwork from Amazon and at the model number on the item and told me that it was the correct item and sometimes not all the newer models are listed on the labels. So, I took the item and hooked up my $350 Olympus D-520 Zoom camera. It fried my camera! I wish I would have seen the other reviews first! I'm now waiting to see if Amazon and/or Circuit City will do the right thing! DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM IF YOU PLAN TO USE IT WITH AN OLYMPUS D-520 ZOOM DIGITAL CAMERA!!!"
5,Excellent replacement,I received the product within in time. Installing it was easy and worked as a charm. Very positive experience overall!
2,Will Never buy another Sony phone,"I'm an addict of Sony products, I can't buy any electronic other than Sony but this will be the last phone that I ever buy from them. I've bought 3 cordless phones from Sony at different times and I am convinced that they DO NOT know how to make a phone with quality reception.The features and the look are always very nice and they're all sturdy and durable but they lack the most important part: FUNCTIONALITY!!!This phone would not even let me place calls at times, it beeps and a message that reads something like ""NO CONNECTION"" appears on the screen eventough I'm standing right next to the base, and even when I do manage to get a connection the reception is terrible.Believe me on this one, I'm a big fan of Sony products but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere when buyin telephones,..."

3,SCOTT FREE,"DEAD RINGER is one of those novels that starts out winningly enough and then sinks into a predictable, sometimes implausible, comfortability that other authors have done better with.Scott Corbin is a serial killer who is executed due to the testimony of one Sarah Hill. Sarah worked with and had a friendship with Corbin, and she was surprised when she realized he was such a ruthless killer. Now someone is stalking Sarah and she swears it's Corbin, but how can it be when he was executed?What follows contains some interesting scenarios and some suspenseful moments. It's not a bad read, just a little too cut and dry."
4,It could be a Lifetime Network Movie of the Week but ...,"...it wouldn't get past a V-Chip.Warning: This story should be rated R or X due to graphic sex & violence.Retired Dr. Charles Smithdeal's 2nd book is again an intricately plotted WhoDunnIt, but without the sardonic ""New South"" social commentary of ""Without Sin."" Convicted Serial Killer Scott Corbin was executed by the State of Texas - but has he risen again to continue his sadistic spree? It reminded this reader of the mere et fille Monkeewrench series, but this one wants to veer off on Harlequin Avenue. /TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer."
4,caliente'!,"I liked the Cher version of ""believe"", But I loved the Spanish version that Mitzie has done. It's cool, I can't wait for her album."
5,Christmas Is...A Percy Faith Classic!,It's been about 40 years since this Christmas album by Percy Faith was released. To this day it's a pleasure to listen to with its rich instrumental selections and voices. The title tune says it all! You will enjoy this for many Christmases to come!
3,Good Songs But They Should Have Digitally Remastered Them! The Sound Is Just A Little Off!,I too had the cassette tape of this Percy Faith Christmas album and updated to this CD and I love all of the songs and my favorite is We Need a Little Christmas. I do have one complaint and that is that the sound doesn't seem to have been remastered and seems kind of low. It's as though they didn't digitally remaster the original mono recordings.
5,Christmas Is.../Percy Faith,"I like anything by Percy Faith, especially his Christmas albums. When I saw this was available, I jumped at the chance to purchase it. It definitely lived up to my expectations!"
2,"Cheesy, saccharine","Take a cue from the album cover illustration -- this is not a traditional, reverential choral Christmas album. I didn't like it, and I don't think it's one of Percy Faith's best at all. Even in the category of more jaunty Christmas albums from that era, it's not even half as good as Ray Conniff's ""We Wish You a Merry Christmas"" album.I'm just saying, know what you are buying when you order this. Preview the music, note the illustration, and make your decisions accordingly."
2,Christmas Cheese,"Percy Faith's Music of Christmas, Vols. 1 and 2 were so gorgeous that I had to have this album, too, but I was greatly disappointed. The cheese content is so high as to make one cringe. The vocal tracks are the worst of the lot because the singers are so vapid. Unfortunately, this is typical of easy-listening albums of the era: no emotion, no feeling, no involvement. They could be singing the phone book and not sound any different. But even the strictly instrumental tracks are lessened by the fairly poor recording quality. Although this album was recorded in the mid-sixties, it sounds compressed, thin, and lacks the fullness and clarity of the Music of Christmas albums that were recorded in 1958! Although Columbia can't change the singers, it could remix and remaster this recording so at least it would sound better."
4,Brings the Christmas Spirit to Life,"I'm an avid fan of instrumental Christmas music, and it's getting increasingly difficult to find CDs that have just the right blend of cheerful and bright Christmas music. ""Christmas Is"" is a well done combination of the types of songs that keep the warm Christmas memories alive and never fails to cheer me up during the holiday season. The verses to the song ""Christmas Is"" are superb and the song reminds me of those snow covered, postcard settings of PA during Christmas. ""Silver Bells"" is a beautiful rendition, almost has a sort of Oriental background. Told my wife if I'm ever in a coma to play me that song!! And ""We Need A Little Christmas"" is also a great song that oughta be just as popular as Jingle Bells. Again, if you like cheerful instrumental Christmas music, I'm almost certain you'll truly enjoy this CD. Another good one is the David Rose Christmas Album. I could only find that available in a cassette, though. Ho Ho Ho!!"
4,Late 80's Post Punk in Great Form,"This is the single album version of Nothing Wrong. I got it because it has 2 or three songs that there aren't on the newer version, the one that also contains the ""Blow"" album. The music found in here is dense and very guitar-driven, with lots of chorus mixed with overdrive. Chris Reed isn't the best lyricist, but he sings his tunes and lyrics convincingly. The Lorries (their nickname) have a very natural and irrisistable groove to their music and you ought to check them out if you like Joy Division, The Sisters of Mercy and Social Distortion. Oh, yes! Chris Reed is still active and played a gig recently somewhere in Europe!"
5,dining room chairs,When I received I was ecstactic they were in perfect condition they got here super soon and were just perfect I loved them
5,These chairs are nicer than the one that came with my Montebello table,"I bought a used montebello table with 4 chairs new off of someone. I need extra chairs and found these. They were the best price around and they are more comfortable that the ones that came with the table. The colors are a perfect match, the backs are a little lower and they don't have the buttons on the back like the ones that came with the table. I actually have thought about changing all my chairs over to these."
1,OK product and horrible customer service,The product was defective (2 front chair legs came with no thread) cannot be attached. Contacted Moshya Home Furnishings. I had to send them pictures and waited for 2 weeks for a replacement. They sent a metal leg instead of a wooden leg (from another chair). Contacted them again and waited for 2 weeks and they sent me just 1 leg. Contacted them again and received no Reponses. The chair quality is OK but the service does not exist. I would not recommend any products from Moshya Home Furnishings based on their customer service
2,Cheap Quality Chairs,"I feel cheated after I received the chairs.The wood that use on these chairs are low quality, you can see the woods are broken when you install the chairs.I am not sure what they put under the seat but it feels wrong, you can feel something cheap under the leather.It said the original price is $499, and I swear these chairs should not worth more than $120 ($60 per piece)."
4,The Price is Right. So is the design.,"These Parson chairs are great for the price, averaging roughly $65 per chair after shipping etc. 2 out of the 4 chairs I ordered aren't completely level. You may want to consider getting a can of cherry finish to polish over leg defects in the wood, and replace the cheap plastic feet with something from Home Depot or Lowe's. I like Parson chairs because they offer real back support, unlike the many aesthetically pleasing dining chairs out there that have wooden or metal back support beams. They look very professional. Leather seating in one continuous piece means the chairs are really easy to clean and stain-proof, unlike fabric cushioned chairs with fancy etchings and beams. You can mix and match these nice chairs with many a dining set."
4,Assembly stinks,"Product is very nice, shipping great, but assembly is difficult had to ream out one hole to get bolt to align with internal threads"
3,"His story, not really about Inca","This is a story about a man and his spiritual journeys in Peru. He spends alot of time talking about synchronicities about adopting his Peruvian children. It's a heart-warming read about someone going through spiritual growth. However, if you are looking for information about Andean spiritual teachings then your best bets are Chamalú: The Shamanic Way of the Heart: Traditional Teachings from the Andes and Return of the Children of Light."
4,Great imagineer and business model info,"This is not a tell all/behind-the-scenes gossip book. It reads like a business venture case file with some interesting bits of Disney design and innovation thrown in. The author gives equal wonderment to the imagineers' genius as to the company's business decisions.Also, this book was the catalyst for a to take a side trip to Celebration, Florida after our last Disney vacation in Dec 2001. The book peaked our curiosity to see Walt's real/intended version for a prototype community of the future."

1,"Does not stick, too short...","This item is very poor quality. I cleaned my lens cap very thoroughly before attaching the sticky part. I also held it in place for a few minutes to allow a good adhesion. However, after a week of very light use, it just fell off. So I had to super glue it back on. Also, the leash is very short. Overall I would not recommend this product."
1,USELESS!,"This is a black string with a piece of elastic that's crimped into a circle tied to one end and attached to a little piece of round plastic with some mounting tape. $1.99? it should have been .01 (with 2.99 shipping). The tape came off after a day. And now it's sitting on my windowsill and sliding towards the trash bin. Even when I had it on the camera lens, it would clink and clank and get in the way. I'm just gonna put the lens cap in my pocket. I suggest you do the same with you $1.99."
4,Inexpensive Protection,"These work well to prevent the loss of your lens cap. They're easy to attach to the lens cap via an adhesive pad, and in my experience they stay attached. Also easy to attach to the camera with an elastic loop, which makes it easy to completely remove the cap and tether when you don't want them in your way. Worth the price."
5,Works Great!,"I really like this product. I have a Nikon D5000 and it always bugged when I had to find a place to set down my lens cap, or try to hold it in my hand while focussing the camera. The Capkeeper eliminated that hassle and I love it. I was worried because on my lens caps there is 'Nikon' written on top which is raised and I feared the Capkeeper wouldn't stick as well. I was wrong, they stick well and have stayed on for the month I've been using them while putting the lens's in and out of my camera bag."
4,Never Lose your Lens Cap again,"I have bought another one of these since receiving the first one. I feel confident that I will never lose the lens cap. Attached it to a 72MM lens cap and it holds it on well. I have attached the elastic part on the barrel of my 18-200 lens and after 2 weeks of shooting and walking around Paris, I found this worked quite well in keeping the lens cap with the camera. I'll buy another when I get a different size lens cap.Only gave it 4 stars since I think it is still a little pricey around $4. It is just an elastic with a plastic piece with double sided tape. I would buy it again anyway if I needed to."
4,"Great , hard to find item","Hunted all over for these after losing my lens cover. These are perfect, inexpensive and simple to use."
1,digital camara user,"The attachment onto the lens cap broke on the first day I used it. The lens on my SLR is too large for other style attachments that connect from the cap to the camara. There must be a better way to attach a lens caps to a camara! Thankfully, I didn't loose the lens cap."
3,Alternative solution,"I don't have this product. The solution I came up with is to put velcro (I used industrial strength) on the exterior side of the lens cap, and on the bottom of the camera (use the soft velcro on whichever of those will be touching something in your camera bag that the hard velcro will stick to). I haven't used the camera much since, but it seems good so far."
5,Perfect Fit,"I recently purchased a Canon Powershot SX20IS through Amazon. The lens cap fits securely on the lens barrel but there is no tether, only a clip inside to attach the cap onto the neck strap, which I don't use. When I saw this item and the reviews were very positive, I decided to buy it. This is THE tether that all super zoom and DSLR cameras should include. The elastic band fits snugly around the lens barrel and the sticky button fits onto the lens cap securely. The tether may be one to two inches on the long side, but better long than too short."
5,Great item,"Love these capkeeper things. This company (A&R) is a great company. The items came quick. They didn't charge me shipping. Perfect packaging and like it stated, the items were brand new. Not used. I have one of these capkeepers for each cap for every lens I have. I got one at first but I have different size lenses and even sharing between the couple same size lenses got annoying. Got one for each now. Yay. So much easier. Don't lose my caps and it's one less thing to be concerned about since I carry so much other stuff when taking pictures."
5,Still 5-stars after a year,"Short and sweet: I bought this item January, 2011 for my Nikon D90. The adhesive still sticks to the lens cap. Something functional for $1.99! I'm purchasing another one for a new lens."
3,Be aware of the size of the lens cap you place it on.,"I've bought this several times and what can I say. It works, so you really can't complain because it doesn't cost alot for this and I would recommend having a backup or two in case the adhesive gives out. This also depends on the size of the lens cap you're placing it on so within reason, 58mm or less works great. I had them stick on for quite sometime and if it does gets loose, use a small strip of gaffer or electric tape. Sticks right back on. I did however tested it on larger filter sizes such as 72mm and I could say that they won't stick on very long. It stuck on for at least several months and gave out."
1,Elastic snapped within seconds,"I received this item, keen to have it placed on the camera and lens cap. Once I placed the elastic band on the lens and after adjusting it a little to ensure it is in a good place, the elastic snapped. Very bad quality. Avoid buying."
1,Poor adhesive!,The cap fell to the ground after 3 times using this cap keeper. I wouldn't recommend buying it unless you pull the sticker off and glue it to your camera's cap using a proven adhesive.
2,Fell off after 3 weeks of use,"I had high hopes for the capkeeper, based on the reviews. However, after only three weeks of light use, the little ""button"" became detached from the foam and adhesive on the lens cap. I'll be buying another one from a different manufacturer and spending a little more, hopefully I'll get one of better quality."
1,Elastic broke installing first time,Total junk. The elastic broke while slipping it over the lens for the first time. Do not waste your money.
4,Life saver,"This is a must for me. I al always putting things down and then forgetting about them. I have had this on my cap for my Nikon D3100 for a couple of months. The adhesive is still sticing to the cap with no problem. I looped the leash around my camera strap so that I can accommodate different lenses with a little extra length. I would recommend this product to anyone. It is such an inexpensive accessory to a very expensive toy, what do you have to lose?"
3,Be Wary Of Quantity,"""Sima Capkeeper 2 for SLR..."" sounded like I was getting two (2) lens caps, but it is only one. Pretty expensive for one; plenty of cheaper alternatives."
1,Don't waste your money,"It was a total waste of money. The length is too short especially for a 28-135mm zoom lens on my Canon 20D.As a result of its short length, I didn't have anything to use to protect my lens cap. A week after receiving the cap keeper and not being able to use it, the lens cap on my lens fell off somewhere in never-neverland. Guess what, not only did I throw my money away on the lens cap keeper, I now have to buy a new lens cap for my lens. What a bummer!"
2,Piece of Junk,"I was excited to receive this item as I have lost two lens caps in the past. As soon as I took it out of the package I immediately attached it following the instructions to the letter. There is no problem with the sticky part staying put on the lens cap. The problem is with the little string that is attached to the elastic band. The second time I removed the lens cap from the camera, the little string disconnected from the elastic. So now I have a little string hanging from the lens cap that isn't attached to anything. This is a cheap piece of junk! Don't buy it!"
4,So far so good...,"I just purchased the Sima Capkeeper 2 and put it on my canon kit lens 28-135. Works great and seems to be sticking pretty securely and although the string is a bit short, it's doable for this particular lens. I'm not so sure it would be long enough for a larger zoom without interfering."
2,Tend to fall apart but at least Amazon replaces them..,"I have one for my 18-55mm and one for my my 55-300mm. They've only been on a few weeks, but so far they're working as I would expect it to!EDIT: A little over a month after I wrote this review one of them completely fell apart. Yeah, I only paid $2, but even for $2 I expect a product to last more than a few weeks. I'm going to see about returning it.UPDATE: Amazon credited me the $1.99 I paid so I could just purchase a new one as a replacement. I just ordered the replacement and another one as well for my new lens...we'll see how these go!EDIT: And yet another one fell apart. The string detached from the band that goes around the lens. Going to request a credit to replace that one as well. They may be only two dollars but I still expect it to work for more than a month."
1,*WASTE* of money,"Gosh darn but these things are cheap. Unlike other reviewers, I had no problem getting it to stick on my lens cap. I cleaned the cap with alcohol prior to sticking it on, maybe that did it.My problem is that they fall apart too easily. I'm gentle with my camera, simply unsnap the cap & let it dangle. One fell apart the first week I used it - the lanyard came off of the elastic strap. I tied it back on. Another one broke within three months of purchase - I tied that one back on, too. Recently, about a year after purchase, one of the ones that I tied back together broke a *second* time.I really don't like trying to clean dust out of the cap when it gets dropped in the dirt. I give up. Tossing them all out & finding a different solution."
3,Typical,"As with most pianists who seem to be oblivious to the rediscoveries of the ""period"" movement, Goode plays the two Andante movements as if they were intended to be played at a deathly slow tempo. But we've known for years that andante doesn't mean slow, and the andante movements are thereby disfigured by Mr Goode, who should by now know better. Any competent pianist can play the allegro movements acceptably; it's in the other sections that the artist is exposed, and Goode fails through sheer (wilful?) ignorance. A pity, because the piano sounds nice, and the pianist refrains from the posturing that disfigures too many recordings where the musician feels obliged to ""give us something of him/herself"" - and what they give is is invariably uninteresting, and always at the expense of the composer."
2,Not for convex surface,"This film did not work for my skylight. The dimension of the skylight is 20"" by 20"" and is a concave surface as seen from the house interior. I tried all the techniques described in the included instructions as well as several suggestions in the product reviews. The film did not cling to the concave surface for any of the techniques I tried."
2,Dog treats,"Some dogs may like these treats but my Chocolate Lab won't eat them. I am not sure why, but she won't touch them. I thought organic would be better for her but I guess she doesn't think so!"
3,Not sure yet,Not sure yet. To early to tell. Need more time to see if it makes a difference. Not taking the full amount a day though.
5,An Enchanting Reality,I am half way through the book and it has been a journey. I have found this book while seeking a place in the world and it has opened my eyes to more important questions of who we are and what this world is like. Narrative is arresting and the poetry is a springboard to further explore the presented topics and themes. This book has been a steady mentor and steadfast companion as we come to grips with the realities we have destroyed and created and consider where we go from here.
1,Very dissatisfied,This product was not as advertised. Absolutely no return information was inclosed.I have made numerous attempts to contact the seller with no response.
5,Perfectly paired with 14 Ginsu knifes,"We got this for ourGinsu 4846 20-Piece Stainless-Steel Knife Setand it fits every single knife (14 of them), including the Cleaver (in the center space intended for a sharpening steel). I don't like pulling out knifes from a tall upright knife block -- I don't have the counter space and I don't have the cabinet clearance. Keeping them in a drawer is easier (and safer in my opinion), but so is preparing food. When you see all your knives properly organized it encourages me to use the right tool for the job. They stay cleaner too. I'm glad I bought this!"
2,Nice look but cheaply made,"Pros:- Nice look and really liked it at first- Perfect for my needsCons:- Broke after about a year - as described in other's reviews - it's held together by glue, and over time, with all the opening/closing of the drawer w/very heavy utensils in, the sides became unglued.- Slots for knives are NOT evenly cut - a little better quality control would have been nice- Too expensive for what it is"
3,"OK, but can't hold as many knives as you think.","It's ok, built well enough, and expands easily. However, you can only put about 8 or 9 knives in it before the handles get so close together that you can't easily grab them to take them out. You then have to try and grab them by the blade to take them out - not a good idea. If you can arrange the knives well enough to put in more, then you'll have to remember that layout exactly each time you put them in or it won't hold them again. Notice the manufacturers picture shows only 9 because more would be too close together. I would not recommend."
4,The Most Complex Mission Ever Attempted,"Journey into space on one of the most important and spectacular Space Shuttle missions ever, as the astronauts share their experiences on this critical mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope. See the first dramatically improved deep space images from Hubble's newly repaird optics.A Must for your Space Video LibraryThis high-quality NASA-produced video program will let you experience the exciting drama of mission STS-61. Starting with pre-flight preparation and a spectacular night launch, you'll join the astronauts in their extra-vehicular activity as they capture, repair, and release the Hubble Space Telescope.The views aboard this mission were among the best ever seen from space because the Shuttle entered a higher than normal orbit to capture the Hubble Space Telescope. See these views first-hand and hear the astronauts describe what it is like to work in space so far above our planet."
2,"Good facts, too preachy","I had to use this book for a homeschooling group I belong to. There's far too much preaching in certain parts for my taste. And it's certainly very PROTESTANT, pointing out that almost all our Presidents were Protestant (how did that work out with Clinton?) and that our country is built on a PROTESTANT work ethic. No mention of the fact that it was Catholics who discovered the place and were here about 100 years before Jamestown ... but all this stuff is easy enough to skip, and you can actually learn a lot about how our government functions from this book. I suppose in many other books, there is a lot of leftist cant, so it's probably hard to find one that's ""Just the facts, Ma'am."""
3,Seems like a waste of money...,The Reishi Mushroom Capsules didn't seem to do much. I added them to my daily vitamins but couldn't justify the added expense in the way I felt or any other noticable difference. Perhaps I needed to take them for a longer period of time but the $20 per bottle price tag was an inhibitor for that action.
1,I dropped a class at Berkeley because of this book,I signed up for a class at Berkeley that used this book. I dropped the class along with many other students because of the poor quality of this text book. There seems to be no logic order to the book. I purchased Beginning VN.Net and learn VB on my own. I feel I got cheated when I purchase this book! Who wrote all of these positive reviews?
1,This may be the worst computer book ever written,This may be the worst computer book ever written. I am sure all the reviews are from the authors or their friends! The author has a way of making even the simplest thing complex! Try another book!Richard BonnMicrosoft Certified System Engineer
1,DO NOT BUY IT,"This book is horrible. I bought this book for a class and ended up having to buy another one. It is horribly written. It confuses you more than helps you understand the concepts. It is too long and too detailed. I am not against detailed books, in fact, I like them, but they need to be organized and well-written and this book is neither.If you are considering buying this book, DON'T buy it. Look for a better one."
1,How could anyone like this book?,"When I first got this book, I was impressed with all the code and the fancy layout. But around half-way through I realized the following:1. A lot of the output was in something like DOS-boxes! Can you believe that. With such a powerful system as VB.NET, they're outputing to DOS-boxes!2. The rest of the time output was to MessageBox.Show(), which is just a very simple standard IO dialog box. I finally got disgusted when the book got to geometric output and, instead of drawing circles, I was still just printing out the values of the radius and diameter in dialog boxes. I thought to myself ""What the hell is the purpose of this? I'm not learning anything!""3. I took a cursory examination of subsequent chapters and throughout the whole book the authors use those stinking MessageBox.Show() functions.Now the book does cover a lot of territory, but I can't believe the authors couldn't do a better job. Keep searching-this book stinks."
5,Fabulous,"This is a thoroughly thought out, well laid out book for those wishing to learn VB.net; Prior Visual Basic experience is not essential but if you have you can get to the topics you want and read-through it at a fairly fast pace. There are lots of examples and these are well illustrative. I wish the examples were more of real-life sceanarios.The book may look cluttered, but it depends on the way you look at it; the different fonts, colors used is quite helpful in making the topic of discussion stand out.Now the best part of the book is if you are cramming for an exam; the tips and the exhaustive summary is hard to beat. For an experienced developer, the summary alone is sufficient many times to help identify possible problems. One minor complaint for completeness is the lack of coverage of packaging and deployment of VB.net applications.Though it is expensive, I highly recommend this book as this is the only book you will need to get started on Vb.Net."
5,Brave New World,"For the first few years in school, children learn about Columbus the hero. You get the ships and the voyage and the alleged discovery. When I taught third grade I would read this book around Columbus day and it was shock and awe with the kids. The thought that Columbus might not have been such a hero created dead silence around my room. Some felt duped by their second and first grade teachers. A conversation really begins to take hold about information and where it comes from and what you should or should not just assume to be true. It is higher level thinking at its best. After reading this book and having the discussions that followed, many of my students began asking many more questions about the other side of every argument. What a valuable lesson! For many of my students it was a brave new world.Chris BowenAuthor of,Our Kids: Building Relationships in the Classroom"
5,New Point of View,"This story takes a completely different point of view of the discovery of America compared to what we are used to. A young Native American boy is very weary of the men who sound like barking dogs. These men who ""come from the sky"" feast with the very welcoming Native American tribe. After being taken by canoe to go to the white man's ship, the boy escapes by jumping into the water. Although he tried to spread the tale, no one would listen to a mere child. The picture bring this captivating story to life. This is an excellent book to use after teaching about the discovery of the Americas."
1,"If people look different than you, be immediately hostile","What in the world? The message of this book is that it is best to fear everyone that does not look like you.Jane Yolen projects current attitudes back into the past.While there is no doubt that European contact with the New World was disastrous for the people who lived here, this book doesn't tell that story. Instead, this book demonstrates that people who look different should be considered sub-human.Beautiful illustrations make the prejudiced message even more pernicious.Try reading it one time through as if it shows a group of white suburban people greeting the first mixed-race or non-white family to move into their neighborhood. If it shocks you that way, it will shock you as written."
4,encounter,"this book is about when christopher colmbus came to america and first met the natives. It shows that they white explorers wernt really that great, and were not kind to the natives. I think that this book is ok, beacuse it shows the cruelty of the englsih exploers."
2,The beauty is in the illustrations.,"I bought the kindle version of this book because I read it last year to my students and they LOVED the illustrations. The colors captured their attention as I was reading the story out loud. I was going to use this in my lesson tomorrow, but I think I will be making a stop at the library first for the real thing."
5,Excelent quality.,The book I ordered came in plenty of time. When it arrived it was in new condition. I am glad that I used this vendor.
3,Ignorance Does Not Make Columbus Evil,"What I like about this book is that it gives the story of Columbus from another perspective, that of the natives. What I don't like is that the pictures portray Columbus as being evil, when I think he might have just been ignorant. He did not deliberately harm the natives. In fact, this comes from Columbus' own diary- ""I want the natives to develop a friendly attitude toward us because I know that they are a people who can be made free and converted to our Holy Faith more by love than by force."" He also made sure that his men took nothing from the natives without trading something in return. Columbus believed these people were being taken as slaves from others in nearby islands and thought he was helping them by converting them to Christianity and taking them back to Europe. This was ignorance on his part, not bad intentions. If this book is used with school-aged children, I would say to introduce it no earlier than grade three or four."
2,Basic Electronic Theory Book That Reads Like a Law Book,This book is manual of approximately 350 pages. Written in 1982 and reads like it. This was written for techs but seems aimed at engineers. The material is very hard to follow and very dry reading. It's not at all clear on Network theorem and Laws with some errors. The math examples are very difficult to follow and doesn't explain the process and mostly uses symbols and not actual numbers in the examples. No explainations for how they derived Norton and Thevenin equvalent circuits for FETs and Bipolar transistors. Explaination of load lines and digital sections are good. There are some pictures and charts to go with the paragraphs but the math examples are in need of some work. Recommend getting a good electronic math book as a companion to get by. The math book I used is list in recommendations. I have a good background in electronics and got this book as a review and though there's information to be learned here it's diffcult to understand.
4,Unhappy with vendor,"Following the purchase, the vendor, BBV Hot Movie Sale automatically enrolled me in their ""so-called"" monthly movie club @ $9.95/month which was charged to my Master Card. Not good. I have since contacted Master Card to challenge three months of BBV charges."
3,crisitsm of Heersinks review,"Ive only just learned of this books from the Westonaprice website, so i cant comment on it. But i can comment on Mr Heersinks review. He claims Appleton is a mere PhD, and so not qualified to write on this topic. However, lack of qualifications didnt seem to bother Heersink in another of his reviews: that of Mortimer Adler's Ten Philsophical mistakes. He wrote the following:'Adler is not a ""professional"" philosopher, but that doesn't make his contribution any less worthy. Indeed, because of its accessibility and wide terrain, this is an engaging dialectic for most of the prominent philosophers from Plato to Nietzsche, One ought 'So, Appleton may not be a 'professional'MD or DO. That does not make her conrribution any less worthy"

2,A one-time read,"I was initially attracted to this book for two reasons: one, the plot description looked interesting, and two, it was by the author of The Duke's Dilemma, which I loved. Unfortunately, this book seems to mark the downward slope of Nadine Miller's work - I've rated her subsequent books at one star.The problem is not so much the lead characters: these were interesting enough to keep me reading. But some of her secondary characters are too incredible for words, and - as in later books - there are plot twists which left me shaking my head in disbelief. There is the hero's other suitor, who seems at the beginning to be a decent enough person, if over-persistent; near the end of the book he turns out to be a near-villain! And the scene in the Viscount's grandfather's house at the end is too farcical for words. Absolutely incredible."
2,"Unlikely plot, becomes ridiculous at the end","Am I destined to hate books Lee Emory loves? At least it might help me recognise which books to avoid in future! <g>. Since Miller is the author of 'The Duke's Dilemma,' an excellent book and one which I notice Ms Emory hasn't reviewed, I thought this one was worth a try. It wasn't.Yes, Miller tries to bring some social concern into a Regency, which when done well does tend to appeal to me. But for some reason the characters just did not appear either particularly credible or sympathetic. The heroine's friend almost undergoes a personality transplant close to the end, and as for the final scene in the hero's grandfather's house, 'farcical' springs to mind.Since the later book of Miller's I've read is even worse, I really wonder what happened to that talent she showed in her first book. I could even begin to doubt that it was written by the same person!"
5,Unbelievable!,"The Butcher Boy is a book which describes many different feelings of life such as anger, sadness, distress, and many more. The whole story about Francie is very unusual and sometimes you wouldnt expect certain things to happen.this book is summed up in one word... BRILLIANT!"
5,"Savage Wit, Wonderful Skill, Unforgettable characters","Like Burgess' Clockwork Orange and Welsh's Trainspotting (the books not the movies) McCabe brings the reader inside the mind of a warped narrator with such convincing style and craft that the reader is left shuddering for days. The end has already happened in the beginning of the novel and the reader sees the why, the how, and especially the details of a boy's descent into black madness. Along the way, Mr McCabe offers a hilarious satire of small-town busybody Ireland. He truly is a descendent of Swift. The characters are real and accurate. He hits the reader on a number of levels. This book, mark my words, will be renown as a classic of modern literature for years to come. Europe's english language writers, such as McCabe and Irvine Welsh, are far greater writers than their american counterparts. Behold this book as an example to American writers. The style is here to stay"
3,A LITTLE TOO LONG. . .AND NOTHING NEW HERE!,"This book proves that blurbs should be taken with a grain of salt. It's an interesting, if not new, technique of allowing an obviously mad narrator dribbling out details of his horrible crime which, in the end, proves to be unoriginal anyway. Sometimes Francie's voice is realistic but most of the time he sounds like an author trying to be clever and it shows. I struggled to get to the end. Whenever I read something ""new"" like THE BUTCHER BOY, I always fall back onto a classic novel to revive my senses. I'm glad I read it if for nothing else than to save myself from wasting my time on the movie. HA HA"
2,Annoying writing,"Although a 1992 Booker finalist I couldn't bring myself to finishing it. The story is from the perspective of a young boy (10-13 range) who lives with an alcoholic father and a depressed mother in am Irish village in the 1950s. The novel traces the boy's slide into delusion and dementia as his world gets harsher and harsher. It doesn't take you long to realize that the kid is messed up, the only question is how far he'll go. While the author has done a brilliant job of writing from inside a young boy's head, I couldn't find enough it to keep my attention after 100 pages or so. A particularly annoying aspect is the lack of punctuation to distinguish dialogue from internal thought. Some passages are particularly difficult and force you to re-read, interrupting the flow of the otherwise good writing. For some reason, the Scots seem to do this type of thing much better."
1,dull,"boring, the ""adventures"" of a stark raving mad looney bin candadate. the end is two dragded out which makes for the boring part."
2,Not for the Stephen King-friendly reader,"When I picked up this book in the bookstore, its cover seemed to suggest murder and death through the eyes and actions of a child. Not quite. This book is mostly a drama, and not horrific in the least. It seems to be a book of laughs in the end. If you are looking for something to tide you over until Stephen King's next release, read American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis. It is haunting and disturbing, everything that The Butcher Boy is not. If you are looking for a children's book, The Butcher Boy is for you."
3,It's different,"The Butcher Boy had its funny moments along with its sad ones; however, the book never really seemed to take off. It could have been made as a short story and would have been a much better read. That aside, Patrick Mccabe uses a unique style of writing that lets the reader peer right into the mind of the main character. I recommend this book if you have nothing else to read at the moment."
5,Audio is the perfect format for this story,"For anyone who loved Angela's Ashes, this is an absolute must-read (in this case, a must-hear.) Where Frank McCourt's autobiography ends on a note of hope, McCabe's novel shows us the unravelling of one young Irish boy's hold on hope, love and, eventually, reality itself. A truly heartbreaking, luminous book perfectly adapted to the audiobook format through the use of McCabe himself as reader and through the introduction of a hauntingly sung Irish ballad which you will assuredly be singing at unexpected moments for weeks following the hearing of this tale. Well worth purchasing"
4,Portrait of Bitter Youth,"""The Butcher Boy,"" I think, is a beautifully vivid and horrific account of an impoverished, devestated youth. And the pig theme, from Francie's vision of his family as pigs to the butcher scenes, have a sick lyrical quality - a feeling of leading the reader into the kitchen, the sty, behind the facades of Francine's world. Also, the book has a distinctly Irish sense of better times long gone: a mood which seems to run through Irish, or Irish-American, writers as diverse as Trevor & Donleavy. Francine's recurring fantasy of him & Joe at the lake is a haunting motif (though maybe overplayed a little near the end.) There are times when the book becomes strangling claustrophobic, & the reader feels absolutely enclosed in Francine's mad pig world, but, as hard as this is as a reading experience, it does make the book unforgettable. A harsh, angry, & horrifying novel."
4,James Joyce meets Catcher in the Rye meets Ted Bundy,"The hard-to-read style of this book could be an attempt to copy James Joyce, I don't know. I'd like a translation into readable English though :) McCabe is no James Joyce, sorry. But his totally degenerate modern mind, filled with tons of trivial facts about modern culture, is worth the price of the book, yes. The TV movie about Ted Bundy starring Mindy's husband, whats-his-name, of Irish extraction, seems a more powerful psychological insight into a killer's mind than this, and I never quite believe the whole thing, or that there is any real Francie Brady. Still, it's the bargain of the month for people looking for reading thrills."
2,"A tedious, though pyschologically accurate picture","The book may be psychologically accurate, but reading it as a story, I got a little tired of Francie. Although I felt sorry for him, I could not identify with or like him as I could, say, Huck Finn, because he lacks Huck's wit, charm and innocent likeability. It might have been better as a short story, but as a novel it seemed to go on and on with a disappointing sameness. I saw no real ""descent into madness"", as Francie seemed half insane to begin with. All that having been said, the book gives a fairly good picture of what can happen to a child racked by guilt and shame, without friends of loving parents."
5,Hilarious and frightening,"Patrick McCabe's novel ""The Butcher Boy"" is in many respects a masterpiece of voice appropriation. Narrated by the protagonist Francie Brady in a distinctive Irish vernacular, the narrative pulls the reader along with its impulsive energy and wacky flights of humour. Francie's world is not a happy one; it is filled with loss and death and the ignominy of having his neighbours regard him as something less than human. In the end, though a fugitive and a social outcast, Francie avoids despair, overcomes his losses, and relishes his revenge. Nominated for the Booker Prize, this novel is a must read for anyone interested in the kind of fiction that confronts the squalid horrors of modern life head on."
2,Sparsely played and puppets a go-go,"I adore Parsifal as an opera. I have seen it in Beyreuth (98 degrees Fahrenheit and in something that approached the back row which was incredibly uncomfortable) I am wedded to Parsifal I love it. That is until I put this DVD in the drive. The swooning overture put puppets (yes, puppets)on the screen. Not long afterwards we got Wagner's death mask, and then some idiocy when all the puppets had Wagner's head ( and with Wagner,although I'm a fan, you always have to take a peep to see if he might be getting the joke, and he usually does not.) This is serious music. The theme - durch Mitleid wissend/der reine Tor however can be reduced to babbling by any bad production. But if any Wagner opera did not need a puppet or two, Parsifal would score. The music is good but the production is Noddy in Walkure-land and should not be shown to any adult - ever. As it is two discs and not cheap, I should have liked someone to have stopped me from buying this bad set of disks."
1,deception,En voulant retrouver l'écoute que j'avais eue en 1982 dans un cinéma des Champs Elysées j'ai découvert que ce DVD ne permettait pas de sous titres en Franais!de plus la qualité de l'image est très médiocre.Je ne le conseille à personne.Jean-Pierre
1,THE GOLDEN TURKEY AWARD FOR WORST OPERA MOVIE GOES TO.....,"Ok.....as you see by the title of this review, i didn't like it. I am a professional musician, I have played in two uncut Parsifal productions and I was interested in seeing this movie. I can't believe it: honestly, the production values put me in mind of a grade school play. You know: ""Oh, Mrs. Jones, if we put a brown sheet on your desk it can be a BIG rock then, and if we put a gold curtain on Jimmie and tie it around his waist then he will look REAL IMPORTANT...and let's show a movie in the background on a sheet with lights shining off it....oh boy: this is a GREAT OPERA to play with....let's put a punch and judy show in it too...."" You get my drift; now, if you really want to laugh at a pretentious operatic film, this is it. This is not the Bergman Magic Flute: this is TRASH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"and 1/2 stars. Certainly worth a peek, but...","I enjoyed this production but I must advise that the listener take a few steps before viewing this extravagent production. First and foremost, read the opera's libretto ahead of time to refresh your memory. Possibly the worst translation of ANY work I have ever seen. The translation is not in a modern english style many times (items like methinks and other words that I think are half english/half german). Must say that if you love the Parsifal story this production will be worthy of your time. Picture quality is pretty poor at times and mediocre most other times."
1,Missing first act.,This tape is missing the first act.....asked Amazon and they said to return it. Tough to do since it was sent to Japan as a Christmas Gift.
4,"Great Production, Shame about the Sub-titles","I completely endorse Derrick Everett's thorough and thoughtful review of this production, but would like to express one reservation about the DVD. The English sub-titles are simply disastrous, employing the worst kind of cod-archaic English, and subverting Syberberg's project. This would be less of a problem if, as with most opera DVDs, it were possible to turn them off - but it isn't. Contrary to the opinions of some reviewers, I think the sound quality of this DVD is adequate to good, but I would certainly be in the market for a new version with better, or at least removable, titles."
4,The book so far has been very useful for my final project,"I am a final year student of Bogor Institute of Agriculture and am takin a major in agro industrial tachnology. I have been reading this book to help my final project. Although I also use other books, I find this one most helpful. Thank you."
4,This book was amzing!,"The book is awesome, i believe that this book was written very welland with a lot of imagination. The author of this book was really into a magical mystireous , eerie kind of world ans as soon as you meet the characters you can't stop yourself from being totally absobred into this world, feeling youreself like one of the characters. This book includs amazing stories that one could not imagine in real life, it gives you a new prespective of how aging and dieing is also part of life. You can never fully live a life without growing up. Being stuck in one year can never be that wonderufl. This book has it all, the mystery the scare factor, the humor , evrey thing. If you are going to read a book i suggest that yuo read this one."
5,The best Lois Duncan ever,"""Locked in Time"" beat ""Stranger With My Face"" and ""Killing Mr. Griffin"" by miles! It builds tension and suspense masterfully and the plot just hooks and reels in readers. The supernatural angle is played up beautifully and the characters, particularly Gabe and Josie, are well-defined and well-drawn. The relationship between Gabe and Nore is amazingly poignant. I loved the ending, it was just such a fitting, moving closure. It just about brought tears to my eyes. A haunting, lovely tale."
5,Locked In Time,"This was the best Lois Duncan book I have ever read. I thought Down A Dark was my favorite, but Locked In Time had obviously change my mind.It's about when a girl named Nore and her stepfather move in with their new stepfamily. But a family is not what is on their mind. Could Nore be safe with her ""family"" if her father goes away for a few days? I don't think so!I would defiantly recommend this book to anyone!"
5,Locked In Time,"I think that this book was one of the best I have ever read. Lois Duncan is truly a talented author. This book brings mystery, suspense, and true teen all together in one book that is hard to put down. I know I would read 3 chapters a night just because I wanted to know what was going to happen. This book is defenately not a waste of time."
5,Keeps you Reading,The Book Locked In Time was definately on my top ten list! Lois Duncan really knows how to keep her reader entertained. It made me keep reading wondering what was going to happen. Whether or not Gabe was going to kiss Nore and what would happen with little Josie. Read it. It was the Greatest book. I wish there was many more like this. Read It!!!!!!!!!
3,Locked in Time or Locked in Boredom,"Have you ever read a book that when you get to the end it just dissapoints you? Well this is one of those books. The plot line seems to be very traditional. I would consider this book to be a good example of a science fiction story. It only appears to diverge form reality by having certain charectars posses eternal youth.This book is about a girl whose mother died and father remarried to a very beautiful woman with two children. She goes to live with them all for the summer, but soon finds out that there is more to these kind hearted people than meets the eye. In fact, they arent so kind hearted at all. They are very deceiptful. Nore soon realizes that she and her father are in grave danger.The story keeps building and building, but the climax is very weak. Considering the events that occur before the climax, just takes away from the ending.Join Nore as she solves the mystery of the step-family from hell."
2,"A suspensful, but poorly written book","This book was o.k. It is very poorly written, and the only thing that kept me from throwing it away was some suspense. The beggining was a real yawn, but I kept at it because I had to for a book report. It has a VERY predictable ending. It's a B- letter grade book. Okay if you are really tired or something."
2,Creepy...,"If you like creepy stories, this one is for you! Lots of twists and turns. It is well written, but the reason I gave it only two stars is because I was expecting something different. Not a bad book for a horror story."
2,Locked in Bordeom,HAving to read the book for English I found this book good with details but not that great of a story. This story uses very trite situations and Gabe and Lis die. The books not worth it
4,"A great suspense, it makes you believe fictional happenings","""You and your father are in terrible danger! You must tell Dad...Nore, are you listening?"" Seventeen-year-old Nore Robbins ignores her mother's dream warning; after all, she has had other visions of her mother since she died. Nore's father, Chuck, is a famous author who remarries a woman named Lisette Berge; a widow with two children named Gabe (17) and Josie (13). But Lisette has a secret about her family and their past that no one knows about. Nore begins to find some very suspicious things in her stepfamily's lovely plantation home, like the marriage certificates in the former slave quarters. But when her father leaves Nore alone with her stepfamily and all the answers, what will they do to prevent Nore from telling their secret? Can she escape? Lois Duncan makes this story very believable and suspenseful; you won't want to put it down."
5,best book,Although this was not my favorite Lois Duncan book.it was still great. Lois Duncan is one of very few authers who writes her books not assuming that children or young adults are stupid. I have read every single one of her books and i hope y'all will do the same!
5,Great and wonderful Book !,"i thought it was a really great book. But, what ever happened to Gabb and Lisette? Did they die? The book was about a girl named Nore, who was visiting her dad and her new stepmother, and Nore's new step brother and stepsister. They seem really strange to her. She knows she is indanger, but her dad doesn't believe her. It was a Great and exciting Book!"
5,Lois Duncan is the best!,I read this book awhile ago but it kept me thinking for a long time afterwards. It's absolutely brilliant. Anyone 18 or under should definitely read this book. I loved one of her other books called 'The Eyes of Karen Connors'. I hope Lois Duncan writes loads more like this. Two thumbs up!
4,Could not put the book down,The mystery as to why Nora's mother would worn her makes you realize to always go by your intuition.The end was sad.
5,"I read the whole thing in one sitting,I couldn't put it down","Nore meets her new step-family, but her good first immpressions of them soon fade when she starts to become suspicious of their intentions."
4,Interesting book,"This was a very good book it left you in supense through-out the book. The ending was a little too dull for me, but it is a great book. Easy to get into and everything i would recommend this book to others"
4,Good but it ended tooo fast,"I really enjoyed reading the book which is about 17 year old Nore who has to live with her new step mother, who seems to have some sort of secret which her and her new brother and sister know about. The ending came a bit too quickly and i found that i had a few questions that were unanswered. I think the ending also could have been decribed a bit more with more detail. Either way though i enjoyed the book."
5,When I started this book I could not put it down.,"The book ""Locked in Time"" by Lois Duncan was a real attention catcher. I could not put the book down. I read it in one night and laughed, cried, gasped all through it. Lois Duncan is the most wonderful author also. I have read many of her novels including Gallows Hill, Dont' Look Behind You, The Third Eye, Ransom, and Daughters of Eve. They all are wonderful and I suggest everyone to read her books."
5,Great book,I've read a few of Lois Duncan's books and I've loved every one of them! This one is one of my top choice.
5,256 Pages of Wisdom for survival in the Brave New eWorld!,"When I first started this book I thought that it was really quite entertaining. By the time I was half way through I found myself e-mailing bits and pieces to friends, collegues and clients. But, it was when I got to the latter part of the book devoted to !eadership that the power of Louis Patler's insight and wisdom really hit home for me. This is where the threads he wove came together to show us how his 300 lessons for tomorrow can be applied to create the kinds of organizations worthy of our loyalty and commitment. Thanks Louis... You wrote one heck of a book!"
1,300 IRRELEVANT lessons...,"I read the book only in part and I wouldn't buy it again. The author tries to ""teach"" with stories and anecdotes. Very basic..."
4,The Slate Roof Bible,"This is a very informative book. Some of the information is focused on historic preservation, but overall a very good reference book."
4,"A ""must-have"" for slate roof home owners","I work for a roofing company that specializes in slate. I can tell you from experience that this book is indeed full of very good tips on preserving what is, imho, the very best roof covering a person can possibly have on his or her home. Mr. Jenkins is absolutely correct in his assertations that bemoan the 'artificial roofing"" we tend to use in this country. The history and the tips expressed are an invaluable resource to those of us who appreciate the natural beauty and durability of a slate roof. My commendations on a fine effort."
5,Unique construction book,"I am not in the construction field but read the first edition of this book because I was researching for a new roof. This book goes into a lot about slate without ever feeling boring because the author ties together all the aspects so well. Often the book will go into history, with facts like first hand accounts of relatives of people killed while working in a quarry. Such tidbits may seem odd in a construction book if you don't read the book, but when you do read it you'll see how everything said connects and helps you understand the topic better. Such pensmanship is rare, and I never thought I'd see it in a book about roofing. You won't regret reading this book if you want to learn about slate."
3,Narrowly written,There is a narrow almost closed mindset in the writers/practioners approach.While he is clearly knowledgable and presumably without peer in North America I don't see how this could be considered comprehensive without including the practice of slate roofing around the world. I would have liked to see a comparison of techniques other than nailing such as use of hooks as well the more recent use of metal battens with minimal headlap. He clearly loves what he does and has a wonderful website but after viewing his website and the videos the book is a letdown.
3,Hard to pinpoint.,"While some of the photography was beautiful, there were a couple of things that I disliked about the book.The first was the fact that I felt like I was intruding. It didn't seem that the people photographed had always consented. [Many Amish do not like to have their photographs taken, because of a Biblical passage.] Some of them seemed like they had allowed the photographer in, but in some photos I just couldn't help feeling that something wasn't right.The second was the layout. I thought the book was very poorly layed out and could have been much more effective if it had been properly laid out. There is a lot of interesting information held within the pages of this book, if you know where to look. [It is difficult to find captions for pictures, etc.]It is, however, an informative guide to the Amish."
1,Classical guitar muzak,"Elevator muzak: soft versions of already soft music, such as showtunes and soundtracks. Just add a dash of classical guitar noodling, and you get this recording.As a fan and student of classical guitar, I feel this recording does the instrument a disservice."
5,A must for English teachers,"I used this all year (along with other resources) as openers for my classes. My kids liked them, actually! A really useful and reasonably priced tool!"
4,My impression about this martial arts dvd...,"Well I can say that this Jackie Chan's film is one of the classic and greatest I've seen coming from a youngster Chan. I expected more participation on Jackie, instead there were several unknown actors that I've never seen in my life as a Chan's fan. I got well impressed by the bad guy performance of Sammo Hung. The guy has great talent making bad boy's role. The only thing I disliked, was Jackie Chan's death. I have the habit of seen Jackie as a Hero and never encounter death but this time, It's the only movie that I found Jackie's character's death. It's worth the buying but in the other hand, if you are a fan that is always accustomed to see Jackie alive at the end of the movies, my advice is not to buy it."
4,Interesting film but has its boring moments too,The action in this film was very continuous but when there was no action sequences it got kinda of boring. YOu can really see John Woo's style beginning to build up. He clearly is starting his signature characters where they start to bond with brotherhood sacrifice and friendship.Best parts: Last fight scene was the climax of the film
5,Great for Fact Lovers,"I flipped through a bunch of books (and someone gave me What to Expect When You're Expecting). But The Baby Center's Guide had the most meat of those I looked at. I'm the type of person that wants the facts written in intelligent terms. The rest seemed ""dumbed down"" in comparison."
5,The best pregnancy book ever,"I am on my 3rd pregnancy. This is the best book for pregnancy questions. It coveres everything you would even think about asking, like what are those sharp pains I am having and how to cope with morning sickness.The proscovers every subjectProvides week by week coverage by other woman who are experiencing the same thingThe consThe only con is that I wish that it would have pictures, I love looking at pictures of fetal develoment."
5,Easy to find Information,"This is a great book for anyone who is pregnant or is planning to become pregnant. The information is up-to-date and easy to find in this large data jammed book. Even though my 'babies' are now teenagers, I still had questions about my pregnancies that had never been answered, but the answers were easy to find in this book. I had not had success in finding the answers before I read this guide. I wish this book had been around 17 years ago."
3,It depends on what you're looking for...,"If you're looking for an anthology of popular and semi-scholarly works on atheism written over the last few hundred years, then this may be worth your money. On the other hand, if you're looking for the best-argued case for atheism available, then spend your money elsewhere (e.g., Michael Martin's, Atheism: A Philosophical Justification, is much more thorough and rigorous). Although at some point I may use this as a supplemental text for a philosophy class on theism and atheism to give my students a taste of the history of atheism (while using selections from, say, Leibniz, Aquinas, and Anselm for the theistic side), I currently only use these essays as examples of either poor logic (e.g. Paine) or of arguments for atheism that have already been refuted. In short, this work is of historical value but it will not offer much to those who've kept up with analytic philosophy of religion in the past 30 or so years."
4,It was a good spell book with added gems.,"No pun intended, the gems are not the gemstones but the relaxation exersize at the begining of the book, embracing the goddess and god meditations, working with the elements section, and using meditation beads section. These are the true gems of this book. The spells were alright. They informed you of the goddess and stone that were to be used. The guides meditations are nice, and poetic. There is a section at the end of each spell that gives you advise on how to further bring the purpose of that spell into your life. My favorite parts were the priestess speaks, they were very uplifting. I will be using the last few sections of this book often and also the relaxation technique that she offered earilier in the book. I am also going to look at her prayer books, her poetry is very beautiful."
5,Quite transcendent in its message,"Knowledgeably written by Galen Gillotte (a ""Solitary Wiccan"" who draws upon her twenty years of experience and expertise), Sacred Stones Of The Goddess: Using Earth Energies For Magical Living offers prose and invocations, guides for incorporating crystals and semiprecious stones into talismanic magic, meditations and prayers to the Goddess. Expressly written for Wiccan and New Age Magick practitioners of all skill and experience levels, Sacred Stones Of The Goddess is deeply spiritual, and quite transcendent in its message. Of special interest are the easy to follow instructions for assembling and utilizing personalized thirteen-stone divination set and instructions for crating and Wiccan prayer beads for communion with the Goddess. Sacred Stones Of The Goddess is an informed and informative contribution to New Age Metaphysical Studies collections in general, and Wiccan oriented ""Goddess Worship"" reference shelves in particular."
3,Back to the Beginning,"While quite entertaining for the most part, it's hardly mindblowing young adult fantasy. Quite frankly I'm most impressed with the design of the books over anything else. However it's a quick read, and if you've read the first three books, it's fun to see how Twig's parents met."
1,The Cover Is The Best Part About This Album....,"... as the music is not as good as you may want or wish it to be. It took another 2 or 3 albums before they got the message that the purpose of making records is to sell them, not to feed their egos. Incredibly enough, thought this album was released in 1971, the cover with the tattooed woman who would have been shocking at that time, barely gets noticed these days when anyone that looks at least 16 in this country can get their entire body permanently tattooed for the price of a good pair of speakers."
5,Indelibly Stamped cd,"Got it for a friend and she was thrilled when she opened it up,the price was right and i was happy to have found it."
4,An Integral Part of the Supertramp Collection,"This album sheds some light on Supertramp's early musical endeavours. Their sound is still raw and bold. Hodgson is still experimenting with his vocal abilities and so is the rest of the band. This album, along with Supertramp(another early album), are essential to any Supertramp fan who likes to know more about how the group had developed its unique sound. Definitely not for a beginner though. If you've never heard Supertramp, you'd better start with Even In The Quietest Moments or Crime Of The Century."
3,Finally - normal clothes.,"My wife wanted a copy of their greatest hits because of one song (Illusion?). But every other copy on Amazon had them wearing some freaky outfit, That may be their thing - I don't know...but it was nice to see them in normal clothes. As far as the music goes, my wife loves it...I'm just not into their kind of music."
4,Atention deaf men,"This DVD has no subtitles. Neither in English, neither in Spanish.Craso error inexplicable."
1,Annoying and unreliable,"Maybe this show appeals to some people, but to me the characters seem like a bunch of annoying, whiny retards. I can't stand the voices of the main actors - two of them shriek rather than talk. Rather than provide comedy that everybody can enjoy, Will & Grace revolves around cliches and gay sex jokes. Debra Messing is the only salvation in the show, but she's not enough to save bad comedy."
5,Great album,Love the cd but it sounds soo much better on vinyl! Great. ........ ..... ... ... . . . .
2,Colors are different from the picture,"I bought this t-shirt for a friend of mine depending on the coloring of the picture but when i received it, i was disappointed because it's sooo different, the upper part (neck and shoulders area) is faded GREEN, however in the picture it shows as if the color is blue-ish grey. So the whole T-Shirt looks odd, with the Green upper part and the purple part (hem area). I'm not so happy with it nor is my friend. but i have to admit the quality of the shirt is Good!"
5,"Very good, helpful book",This book is the first point of attack if I get a problem with my PC. I like the layout of the book - very easy to find what I need. Sensible advice. Calm presentation in a crisis - very helpful.
2,Not the best buy.,"I purchased 5 of these for my therapy dept. Out of that 5, 3 are broken. The plastic is cracking on all of them and they are barely 3 monthes old. I thought I might save a little and buy a different brand but it backfired and now I wasted money on these and have to buy more for them and get the ones i should have gotten in the first place. DO NOT purchase these if you will be using them daily as they will not hold up."
2,Still looking for a decent goniometer,I thought I was getting a good deal when this came with two goniometers. The large one is made of brittle plastic and broke within a week. The small one is so flimsy & small that it's pretty much useless.
2,goniometry,"The goniometers will melt in a hot car. Also the arms are not stiff enough that when you move the range to measure it will not stay in place for have accurate reading, esp when trying to measure a stroke patient with increase tone and measure prom."
2,Did I pay for a freebie?,"If you've seen or used one goniometer, you've seen or used them all. Except this one, which has a big, blue, honking ""Prestige Medical"" logo on the protractor dial. (There's sure no logo in the picture of the product.) This looks like something that would be handed out for free at a trade show. I'm wondering why I was charged for the privilege of advertising for this company? It's too much trouble to send back, and it works fine, so I'll keep it. But if you want a plain-vanilla 12-inch goniometer, don't buy it from this vendor."
2,Flimsy plastic,"I thought it would be made of sturdier plastic, but rather flimsy. Worried it could snap with continued use. Nice size though."
5,Good product - As advertised,"This goniometer is small, easy to carry around, and easy to use on a patient. It can be manipulated easily with one hand."
2,brittle,I put one these in my therapy bag and several days later the arms started to crack and break off . The last set of goniometers are bought were very flexible and never broke.
5,It is what it is,"It does exactly what it does. Way cheaper than going to a medical store or even buying it at my university store where it was like $35. Pretty good quality. Hard plastic. Kind of hard to measure fingers, but there are smaller goniometers for that."
4,good PT tool,"Works fine, just a little rough or sharp on the edges, be careful not to scrape someone's tender skin."
5,Good quality and good price,"I needed this large goni for my first year of PT school. Can't complain on the price, it does the job well, and is a good quality product."
4,Excellent wilderness survival book,"This is a good book on wilderness survival, yet not the best by Nehberg. His best is, no doubt about it, ""Yanonami"". I've read that book about ten times and even ended up memorizing some passages!Manual del Aventurero is about different techniques for survival. Includes lists of equipment, medical description of parasits and other nasties that can be found in the wilderness, etc. Very entertaining and a must if you are a true adventurer."
3,Good overall,"A nice, bright addition to the kitchen. But the instructions are baffling: don't use high heat; wipe the interior clean after each use to avoid rust (in a stainless steel, enameled kettle??), etc. I was alarmed at first but have ignored the warnings without any dire consequences so far. My main complaint is that because the spout is so high on the body and the handle is placed where it is, pouring a full kettle can put a lot of strain on the hand and wrist, especially for those with arthritis or weakness. Time will tell whether the kettle falls apart from my ""rough"" (i.e., normal) usage."
1,Spout opening mechanism broke after only 9 months,"After living with only two reliable Revere kettles in a lifetime, we opted for something more colorful in January 2007. Copco is pretty, but I agree with reviewer that pouring puts pressure on a wrist - problem if you have arthritis. The major problem is that with only one tea drinker in the house, the plastic mechanism in the handle that opens the spout cover broke after only nine months. Seems like a durable body with flimsier plastic in handles. Revere kettle 20 years, Copco less than one. Have email into manufacturer to ask about warranty. Never thought to save receipt on a kettle since mine always lasted for decades. Product description refers to years of use. I'll update after I hear re: warranty."
1,Doesn't fit EX-FH100,"This is a nice case but it is too small for the Casio EX-FH100. And this is the case suggestion that comes up on Amazon when you select the EX FH100. The actual case package explains it is for the EXZ series and ""be sure to check whether it can be used with your Casio camera"" Amazon needs to better investigate their accessories and make better suggesions. We will get a replacement."
1,In spite of Amazon recommendation: Too small,"The case is too small for the EX-FH100 also.This, in spite of the fact it shows up as a choice as an add-on for the camera on the camera page."
2,Too small,"I bought this carrying case for my Casio Exilim EX-H10 camera. Unfortunately, the case is too small for the camera."
1,Casio Exilim EX-Case6,This case was listed with the Casio EX-FH100 10.1MP High Speed Digital Camera. My assumption was that the camera would actually fit in the case -- NOT TRUE. The camera can be forced into the case but not inserted easily. This is NOT a good case for the Casio EX-FH100 and probably not for the newer EX-ZR100.
1,Does not fit all Casio EX Cameras (at least well),I bought this as a gift for Christmas and when we tried to put the camera in it was too tight. If you made a great effort you could get it zipped.Camera is an EX-FH100
2,broken product,It came broken. The light saber was broken off. Also there was no return slip in the packaging. How do I return it?
2,I should have listened and ordered from England,"A fine performance from von Sydow, some dazzling setups by Argento, great music by Goblin, all to no effect because Artisan has chosen not to take original composition ratio seriously. A lousy pan-and-scan. Great movie, lousy edition. A waste of my money. Better than nothing? Maybe that's what the second star is for."
3,Not Good but Not Bad,"I am a fan of Argento. I watched Tenebre when I was 10, the horror still implanted deeply in my mind. I guess people will watch Sleepless either because of Argento or Goblin. Well, the score is just too tame, compared to Suspiria - which is truly a masterpiece. About the murder scenes, I don't find them very horrible and violent. In some way, the special effect is just too gross - the depicated head is obviously a plastic model, the blood in the train muder is too little (compared to Tenebre), the shock is too mild (compared to Suspiria, or Inferno). The only reason I still gave a 3 star is because of (a) Max is a good actor (and famous), (b) the plot is at least with some suspense and twist at the end, though no logic is involved as usual (how come the murderer can go onto the train so soon?) Finally, I do think the quality of the DVD is not that bad, the sound is quite good (thunder, rain drops, etc...), it is not as bad as other reviewers complained about."
2,Argento's style saves the film from being a complete disaster,"An old case from the 80's brings back ex-cop Max von Sydow (Minority Report) who was on the case at the time. The killer was suspected to be a dwarf back then and now as well, so he thinks. Helping Sydow is Giacamo, played by Stefano Dionisi and the two of them are on their own investiagation. While on the investigation, Sydow finally realizes that the killer is using an old childs nursery ryhme in which the killer leaves paper animals and the animals represent the people the killer kills. This thriller's only fuel is Argento's style of direction, although there are a couple unexpected moments and when they reveal the killer but the acting is really bad and some times annoying. The scene where Argento strolls the camera down a carpet, I was waiting for someone to trip and fall in front of the camera. For those Die Hard Argento junkies."
2,Artisan leave Argento Alone!,"Will Argento's work ever be given the justice it deserves. Sleepless as a film is a classic. An interesting story, plot twists, inventive murders all the things that made Argentos earlier work great. Then Artisan has the nerve to butcher his art by cropping the film into a full frame version. Everyone who is familiar with Argento's work knows that his films must be shown in widescreen. How this passed over Artisan ,who claims they are some big new indie film company, is any ones guess. And why can't we have English subtitles? Mirimax, Artisan, New Line and all the others need to quite releasing foriegn films. Leave it to companies like Anchor Bay and Image."
2,US version total rip off!,"I have seen the US version of this film and I feel betrayed! They seriously cut so much out of the Rated-R version and I'm sure the one amazon is selling is censored also even if it does say unrated. Get the dvd elsewhere, perhaps even on ebay. I could not enjoy the video properly. They could of shown this on regular television since it was cut drastically, no gore at all. Murder scenes cut so quickly you did not know what happened to the victims or a even seen a shot of blood until the very end when you see blood dripping from a window when the credits start rolling! So once again, do NOT support the US Rated R version, get an uncut version of this film because you will be missing out on so much!! Do not rent at Hollywood video nor block buster!"
4,Class act!,"Sleepless lacks some of the magic of Argento's earlier films such as Deep red, inferno and Phenomona but is obviously an ""Argento"" film. Good acting and a compelling plot keep the movie interesting throughout. Typically the body count continues to rise at a pace as actors suffer inventive deaths at the killers hand. Camera work is at times superb as the hunted try and out run the murderer and the ""long carpet shot"" is brilliant (see it and you will understand). Goblin provide yet another superb sound track. This film is worth watching a few times to appreciate it properly."
1,SLEEPLESS gets 5 stars..This Edit gets only ONE,"Damn you Artisan Entertainment!I've been waiting months and months to get my hands on the new Argento classic and Artisan not only delivers a weak Pan And Scan copy of the film, they edit out 90% of the violence. The elaborate and dark murder scenes are a trademark of Argento's films and without them, the film is still great but to us Argento fans, it feels like something is missing. It just goes to show that after over 30 years of making great films, Dario Argento still doesn't get half the respect in America he deserves. Anchor Bay should have gotten their hands on this film first, atleast they are respectful to the film and the fans and are not raping good cinema like Artisan. I say rent this movie for now and wait and pray that a director's cut is released in the near future."
2,"Great movie, pity about the DVD","As has been mentioned by those before, Artisan has thoughtlessly given us a full-screen disc which, quite honestly, looks cheap. I've seen better-looking VHS-images.NOTE that the version I saw WAS UNCUT, but I do not know which version Amazon is selling. The disc itself SAYS UNCUT right on it, and obviously this is the one you want (should you want to bother buying it at all). The film itself is rather graphic, and while not a total return-to-form for Argento, it's certainly a step in the right direction after his last few mis-fires. I'd give the film itself four out of five stars, but this horrid transfer gets only one (yeah yeah, I know, I rounded-off my rating to two stars.... I just can't bear to give an Argento film only one star, even with a transfer this poor...!)."
1,What a waste.,"I can't believe that in this day and age any company would put something out this badly. WHY BOTHER? Who did they think would buy it?I just realized that people could take this to mean the movie itself is bad. I LOVED this movie when I finally saw it on my all region player WIDE SCREEN. I was just saying that the American release of this is a freakin' sin. Argento still has it after all this time, he just needs to be seen in the correct ratio."
5,large unstained bracket is substantial,"I ordered this wood bracket to support my laminate laundry folding table in my new house. We stained it like the cabinetry so it matches perfectly. (The other end is not visible so my husband used another piece of wood scrap to support that end.) It looks great, is very strong, and is made well. It is larger than other similar brackets. It took the stain beautifully. This is the one you want if you want a substantial support system that is beautiful."
1,"What year is this, 1995","Reminds me of the fish screen saver from the mid 90's. Amazing animations for that time period. Very poor quality for todays standards. Do not waste your time. Has constant audio of water sound that again sounds about like the water sound from that old fish screen saver from the mid 90's. I think it was included with Windows 98, but had been sold for some time before then.If you have been under a rock for the last 15 or so years and are amazed that there is an internet you may find this enjoyable."
4,A sweet soufflé of song,"It's not deep, it's not lasting ... but it's pure, sugary fun, from beginning to end!As a previous reviewer noted, albums by actresses are a tradition in French pop. Jeanne Moreau made one, Brigitte Bardot made one, so why not Valérie Lemercier? True, she stretches for some of the higher notes, and even loses the melody a couple of times. But that's beside the point. What counts here is the spirit, capturing the artless, breathy, little-girl singing style of so many before her. And Bertrand Burgalat's retro-pop songwriting & production recreates that style perfectly, enveloping the listener in a confectionary bubble that glistens with delicious icing.Not for every taste, obviously, but charming & bouncy to the last bite. Recommended!"
3,Rand McNally 2005 Road Atlas and Travel Guide,"I unwittingly ordered this atlas, not realizing that half of it was a state-by-state travel guide (my error). It is, therefore, quite bulky, and unwieldy to use. Next time I'll read the description more carefully!"
4,Well done but not as good as in the past,"This is better than the lower cost Rand McNally Atlas.What we didn't like is that in prior years, their was more coverage of sites of interest in each state. Now, there are just some suggested regional tours in the front.The book itself is of high quality and easy to read and use."
3,Something different to watch.,This is a fun show to watch and wonder how there going to get out of the woods. Hope they make more of these.
3,Overall a good show for off roading fans,"As a gear head myself, I found this show mostly entertaining. The scenery is great, the Jeep is a beast and the premise is pretty cool. The great part is the Jeep of course and Gary Humphrey, who is basically a Bear Grylls type who fits right into this type of show and situations. The bad part, for me, is the sound dubbing and Bill Wu, the show's gear head. The sound dubbing I'm talking about is revving diesel engine sounds they put over the Jeep, making it sound like the Jeep is constantly revving and its a more than a bit annoying. As for Bill, he's ok at driving, but he's always whining about being hungry, hates the outdoors, and is rarely a team player with Gary. If you can overlook those two things, which in the end I could, its a fun show."
4,Beautiful Outfit,I got this outfit for one of my American Girl dolls a long time ago (when it first came out) and absolutely loved the outfit! This was and still is one of my most favorite American Girl outfits!
1,Poorly Packaged - DO NOT BUY!!!,"After reading a review from someone who said their glasses were broken upon delivery, I made the (idiotic) decision to go ahead and risk it b/c I like the looks of them so much. The first shipment didn't even make it to my house as the local UPS center refused delivery. They could obviously hear the broken glass. In my infinite wisdom, I figured the odds were in my favor, so I re-ordered them. Not a good idea! They arrived broken into pieces.The glasses are shipped in cardboard containers, not individually wrapped or anything. There's a tiny bit of bubble wrap around the cardboard boxes, but that doesn't help. Why would they continue shipping like this when they keep breaking??Amazon took the return easily enough. Still, pain in the rear."
2,Square glass = dribble glass,"I was served in square glasses at a friend's house and must say that they are visually beautiful. There is something about the square shape which is very appealing on the dinner table. However, figuring out how to drink from these is somewhat of a challenge. Drinking from the edge is somewhat risky since there is nothing to channel your water into your mouth. Unless your mouth is especially wide, it is easy to wind up with a wet lap when your drink flows right past the corners of your mouth. Drinking from the corner is more satisfying, but somewhat uncomfortable."
2,Broken twice,"The item itself is satisfactory - when not in pieces!I ordered thhis other glasses of the same collection twice, and twice over half of them arrived broken. (The packaging is not apt for shipment of a fragile item: there is no buffer, i.e. foam wrapping or bubble paper, to protect the glasses).Between both orders, I managed to complete 4 of this model, but I still only have only 2 of the other type!!!IDM@email.com"
1,Glasses,"I was so excited to find a square glass! I was starting to wrap them and noticed a sound. Yup, a broken glass and no time to get another set."
1,All but one glass arrived at my door smashed to bits!,"I bought these glasses as a gift for a friend, only to be dismayed that I had nothing to give when the date arrived. I opened the shipment to find 3 of the 4 glasses shattered and had to clean glass shards off my living room floor and clothing. I immediately called the number I had associated with the purchase to report this, and was told that I would need to call yet another number to complain and seek redress. Hardly the customer service I deserved considering their error. I have yet to find the time to sit on hold again and call their other department to sort out this issue. Very disappointing experience to say the least. I will not be buying from them again!"
5,Good old favorite,I was thrilled to find this old favorite out there on Amazon. I had the cassette tape back in the late 80's/early 90's and wore it down. This cd is compelling and oddly familiar at the same time. Love the music and just love the lead singer's voice.
5,Absolutely a classic album,"Fairground Attraction (First of a Million Kisses) bring a unique singing and classic sound to relaxing music, but definitely not one dissapear into the background. One to have in your collection!"
5,Still an amazing CD...,"I bought this one way back in the 80's and I'm glad to say it has held up extremely over the years. I'm happy to introduce this to new friends and they're always surprised that they haven't heard of the band before. Catchy tunes, excellent arrangements and sweet, sentimental lyrics. I can't remember how many times I've used 'Hallelujah' on a mix tape (maybe as often as I've used Jeff Buckley's version of Leonard Cohen's song of the same name, maybe). Not to be passed over."
5,Moving and Very Powerful,"This is a deeply personal story that moved me far more than I expected. I'm a dad that went through fears of my soon-to-be-born child's health, but never the pain that Brad and Nina went through. Very, very well written. Brad's first person point of view really grabs you into the story. I found myself getting up and giving my kids an extra special hug after I finished each session of reading.A word of note -- be close to a box of tissues when you are reading - male or female; it's that powerful! But realize that the story ends showing the Stetson's strength and hope. Amazingly, you'll feel stronger yourself.Bravo, and thank you for sharing your story with the rest of us!"
4,pretty good.,"a lot of great, unheard old r&r stuff here. Lee Rupe's EbbRecords label was shortlived, but produced some great stuff. The first CD in this series (Ebb Records story Volume 1) has more doo wop and vocal harmony. This is more soulful stuff here. The same kind of stuff can be heard on her ex-husband Art Rupe's Specialty Records label. People here on the East Coast never really got to hear a lot of this music, Too bad. But then aqain, people on the West Coast weren't that familiar with The Charts, or Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, either. So I guess it evens out............"
5,Listen to it!,"This is Parker's masterpiece. Regardless of whatr modern critics have to say, and they are absurdly condescending to Parker's generation, this is a piece that deserves aplace in the standard repertoire. Having sung the double chorus movement, I can't agree with the other reviewer that this is an easy sing: it's not. It is a highly polished work by a master craftsman. Listen to it before you read any critic's commentary on it: you be the judge. People who accuse PArker of aping German models aren't listening close enough!"
2,Disappointing,Sounds like they tried to assemble a case od hundreds to impress the listener. This in an emotional-romantic work and they don't put out any emotion.The recording technical quality is marginal. Don't waste money on this one.
2,new old book,product was worn and looked torn and not pleasant to open and read just by one looking at the cover. My expectation was far from exceeded based on the product description and probably one of the worst used books I have ever purchased. Not quite satisfied.
2,Disappointed with shipment,"I purchased this text for a summer semester Biology lab, and like most college students, was looking for a great deal. Unfortunately, being in a summer semester, there are only about 16 or 17 class meetings in one month, so it is greatly condensed. I ordered this text from Warehouse Deals, Inc. with overnight shipping to receive the text for the next class. It was an extra ~$20.00, but worth it to have the text and be prepared for class the next day without spending the ridiculous college bookstore prices. The text did not arrive the following day, and did not come until the day after, again too late for my class. All in all, the book was in acceptable condition and I have no complaints regarding that. But the shipping was an absolute waste and I have already contacted the company. Amazon offers expedited shipping for a negligible fee compared to what I paid, and I have received things in the same amount of time."
3,Lab Book,This book is written in alot in the first few pages...But I will be able to manage after those chapters. I just wish it was in pencil and not pen!
5,Civil War History at Its Best!,"For fans of the Civil War(American) this book is great. I knew little about the Confederate ironclads until I read Elliott's wonderful book. It describes the history behind the building of this powerful ironclad, about the sailors who made her a great fightin' machine and about her unusual and amazing battles. Also sadly her demise.What happened to one of the few Confederate ironclads not destroyed by her builders? You'll find out in this great book.As to those wondering about the author. He is the third cousin of the brilliant designer of the Albemarle. A truly amazing story."
3,Should get this for the philosophy alone,"I would rate this book higher if regardie had not used the color scheme that he did, for most practicers of Ritual magick and Kabbalah know that the Queen scale colors are traditionaly most important for the sephiroth, which he used, but for the paths he use the Knight scale, or Yetziratic scheme. If you were to be totally correct when makeing an illustration of the tree with these colors the Queen for the sephiroth and the King for the paths would be better. Aquire The Magicians companion by Bill whitcomb for a full list of these and by different authorities. Other then that one thing, the book puts forth a greath philosophy and way of thinking. I especially enjoy his describing what he means by solar and lunar consciousness, and the combining of the two. It helps put you in the proper mind set in other words."
4,good book......,"isreal regardie speaks from mythology when speaking in qabalalistics tearms sometimes that can ether be frustrating or tiresome along with his wording other than that this book is a great introduction exsplaining the seferoth,paths,along with there hebrew connection there are visualization techniques and a wealth of other information as well,anough to keep the mind thinking for a while recommended..........."
3,Pretty good album.,"Helloween is a good German band, and Keeper of the Seven Keys-Part II is a pretty cool and solid disc. I find this album to be just as satisfying and listenable as the previous one. This album's musical direction is hard rock with a metallic and melodic edge. The musicianship, songwriting, and production are tight. Helloween really does a great job with the musicianship. Michael Kiske's vocals are operatic and effective. There are also plenty of cool guitar riffs and solos throughout. There's a total of ten tracks, and everyone of them is energetic and listenable. One track (""Keeper of the Seven Keys"") is over thirteen minutes in length. My favorite ones are ""March of Time"" and ""I Want Out."" ""March of Time"" sports a really nice chorus, and the guitar playing on ""I Want Out"" is infectious. ""I Want Out"" is still a cool song after all of these years--the lyrics to it are also great. The album cover is interesting, too. This disc from Helloween is solid and worth a listen."
2,Overrated,"When I read the reviews of this album on Amazon, I rushed down to the music store expecting to purchase an truly epic metal album. Boy, was I disappointed. Most of this album plays like a kind of rock soundtrack to a Terry Gilliam novel. There are only really two decent tracks, 'Save Us' and 'March On Time' the rest is just weirdly insane babling. The reviewer who said that certain tracks send a cool sensation down your spine, must live in a world of his own."
4,Well Done Melodic Metal,"I've had this release for a few years. I just listened to it from start to finish very recently again, and am amazed by how well done this album is. The playing is extraordinarily good. Michael Kiske has a great voice to match. The production is also not shabby, but very clear and pristine. ""Rise and Fall"" is not only worth a listen, but also pretty comedic. The title track is an example of great guitar skill. Well done melodic metal. German metal at its best."
5,Heavy metal at it's best!,"Only album I like more is ""Master of Puppets"". This one has it all - speed, harmonies, rythyms, pop sounds - a breath of fresh air from the other poser bands."
5,Outstanding,"I have had this tape for years and my tape finally played its last song. I had to replace it with a CD. Music isn't done like this anymore. It is great driving music, great resting music, great music for anything. It is all so well done and even stimulates the most intellectual of minds"
5,Keeper of the Five Stars!!!!!,"The best Helloween album in my opinion is great power metal. I thin this album started the first season of power metal. Part I wasn't so good but this album shows they have a great style. ""Eagle Fly Free"", ""Dr. Stein"", ""I Want Out"", ""March of Time"" are great fast tracks...and all of them are my favourite Helloween tracks. The openers ""intros"" have been always very good and this album doesn't make an exception. ""We Got the Right"" has great lyrics about the freedom. ""Keeper of the Seven Keys"" is my favourite song in this album. It is so long, very religious...I think it tells about Jesus who destroys the power of Satan. ""Save Us"" is a great bonus track...it is also religious...it has sad lyrics. ""You Always Walk Alone"" is so great...it is also quite relious: ""Now When I got the key to open Heaven's door..."". ""Rise And Fall"" is very funny lyrically and maybe musically too.Stars: Keeper of the Seven Keys, Eagle Fly Free, Dr. Stein"
1,Buy the components and make it yourself....,"I should have just built the thing myself. The adapter was broken and extremely fragile otherwise when I received it. After a bit of soldering, it worked reasonably well."
3,One good piece out of three....,"I bought this CD because I heard the trio by Horatio Parker on the radio. While that piece is fantastic (I think it acceptably stands next to the great trios of Beethoven and Schubert), the others are created by and for esoteric academic composers only. I find them flat out annoying to listen to. On the other hand, if you like fingernails scratching across chalkboards and dislike harmony and melody, you'll enjoy 2 out of the 3 pieces on this CD."
5,great-great-great!!,I love this very well thought out and truely meaningful film. The story kept me fully inshouded in the film as the plot turns and twists as well as takes unexpected paths.The characters developed by John Lone and Sammi Davis displays their unique approach and talent in the acting profession.I consider this video a must see for any serious movie buff! Buy this video-buy this video-buy this video!!
1,This Sucked!!!!!!!,"Nothing much is funny, entertaining or worth watching in this movie. I could hardly stay awake. Matthew overacts the part. Garner has no chemistry with MM. The girlfriend from the past is annoying. Michael Douglas plays a sleezy, womanizing swinger type...not believeable or interesting.The movie drags and drags. I was hoping to quickly get through the past and present......but unfortunately the future was no more interesting. Of course the whole movie is entirely predictable.Don't waste your time or money on this one. Not even on a rental, unless you use it as a sleep inducer!!!"
2,BAH! HUMBUG!!,"Wow, I'm sorry Jennifer Garner had any part in this. In the future, Matthew McConaughey should stay in action flicks where all he needs to do is grunt and sweat. No more dialog and absolutely no more attempts at emotional or romantic roles. I really liked him in TipToes but that was a long time ago."
1,JUST ANOTHER IN A STRING OF LOSERS,"FIRST THERE WAS MANAGEMENT, THEN LIES AND ILLUSIONS, AND NOW THE LATEST BUMMER: GHOSTS OF GIRLFRIENDS PAST! IT'S TOUGH WHEN YOU CAN'T EVEN WATCH HALF A MOVIE WHICH IS WHAT OCCURED FOR THESE THREE MOVIES. HOLLYWOOD CONTINUES TO CON US INTO GETTING MOVIES BECAUSE THEY HAVE STARS? IN THEM. OUT OF THE LAST FIVE MOVIES I'VE RENTED, ONLY THE BLOOM BROTHERS WAS WATCHABLE AND ENJOYABLE. PLEASE SEE OUR OTHER REVIEWS IF YOU WANT TO SAVE TIME AND MONEY ON SOME OF THESE LATER RELEASES!"
4,Guilty Pleasure,"I just finished watching this movie. I was torn about getting it because it got some mixed reviews. It was a bit corny, but I really liked it. The main character, Conner is indeed quite the jerk, with few redeeming qualities. But it's not all his fault because he was taught to be that way by his now deceased uncle. The ending was pretty easy to guess, but still it was nice. Overall a good and enjoyable movie to watch. I'm glad I got it."
2,disappointing,"I like Jennifer Garner and Matthew McConaughey and I love good romantic comedies. Two out of three couldn't save this movie for me. It was unbelievable, shallow, tedious, predictable and down-right boring. I was falling asleep part way through the movie so I decided to cut my losses and stop wasting another minute of my life watching this movie."
3,"Same old, same old","I think Matthew McConaghy (while he's one of my favorites) has outgrown these types of parts. This particular movie is a little off the wall. There wasn't much ""meat"" to the story at all. Just a waste of time."
2,Very Disappointed!!!,"I thought this movie was going to be alot better. I watched, and I thought after 30 mins that this movie lacked substance and quality. I was wondering is it going to get better, but even into it for an hour still was disappointed. I saw it because of the two amazing lead roles, and it looked like a great movie. The two lead roles were not enough to make this film worthwhile, and I think they are both very talented. It wasn't them at all. It was just a poor kind of film that shouldn't have been made or if made been written alot better! Im so glad I didn't waste my 7 dollars to see it at the show. It wasn't worth it!"
1,"good, if you need something to knock you out",I have never liked Matthew McConaughey but I love Jennifer Garner so I gave it a chance.But this movie is just bad and an insult to the idea of 'A Christmas Carol.'This just show us what a hack of an actor McConaughey really is
2,Typical Matthew,"I'm going to state a prejudice here. I'm not a big Matthew McConaughey fan. And this was pretty much a typical Matthew McConaughey movie, so that didn't work so well for me.Bascially, for some reason or another someone thought it'd be a good idea to mix a chick flick with a Christmas Carol. Basically, he plays a womanizer the whole movie and then in the last 10 minutes were supposed to believe that he's ""changed"" to be with the girl he always wanted to be with.Just kind of irritated me."
1,The 2nd worse movie I've ever seen,I had high expectations for this movie with such great actors but it was a terrible waste of my time. I wish I had that time back.
4,Cute Movie,"Okay, so this isn't the greatest movie ever made, but it's worth watching just to see Matthew McConaughey! Based on lessons learned from his uncle, he's a ""player"" who can't stick with one woman for very long. The ghosts of three of his previous relationships appear and set him straight. It has some funny parts and overall it was pretty good. Although I can't say I love it, I'll watch it again."
1,I would rate it lower if I could!,"I have seen a lot of movies in my life time and normally I am very easy to please! Even if I did not like a movie I would normally find some good in it! So I am a huge fan of Jenifer Garner (You Know ALIAS) so my wife and I saw this in the drive in. We continued to watch it hoping it would get better...it didn't. For a comedy we only laughed at one part the rest was filled with crude humor that maybe a immature kid would laugh at for hearing the word sex for the first time! Not only was it poor humor but the story line had so much potential but STUNK!!!!! If all you think is funny is sex sex sex and fall into the sex sex sex that's all I can say and think about category than this movie is for you! My wife and I as well as some of our friends still use this film as our inside joke of...""do you remember when we saw that horrible movie...I can't believe we stayed for it."" I really do not see any good in this movie!"
3,"Not bad, but Not Great","Movie was alright, but was not the best of McConaughey or Garners movie career although was entertaining and enjoyable."
4,Could do without the first few minutes,"This movie was quite funny. It was definitely a little different than the actors' other movies but still some good laughs. The first few minutes could have been completely taken out and this would have been a movie I would keep in my collection. For that, it has to go, but most people probably won't care too much about it for it to effect them negatively."
3,not what i expected,"the pace of the movie is so fast, it doesnt give you a chance to get to know the charcter very well. I liked the movie because it was funny and unique but what i didnt like was how fast the movie ends."
5,ghosts of girlfriends past,"I watched the DVD and totally enjoyed the whole thing; esp. the ending. Some of my favorite actors and actresses were in it, which was the main reason for watching it. I have passed it and several others that I have purchased to friends for them to enjoy also."
4,"Cute, funny movie","This movie is good, but not up to Matthew McConaughey standards. Of course, being one of his earlier movies that's understandable. I did enjoy the movie, but am glad I did not pay more for it."
2,The Happy Ending,"On the surface: ""Don't be a jerk, a womanizer, only true love makes you happy and complete"" - that's for those looking for Christmas comedy. Final realization after watching the movie: ""The movie is definitely stupid. But hey, I'm really happy for that guy! He's had a great rich fun life and finally came back to his soulmate to create a family."""
2,DISAPPOINTING TAKE ON 'A CHRISTMAS CAROL'!,"Considering the idea and a good cast, this film is extremely disappointing. The laughs are very few and the romance isn't engaging, so what we are left with is a pretty flat retread of the classic story of Scrooge. This had some potential, but the writers must have been asleep while putting this one together."
2,Review,The audio was off so made it hard to enjoy. My first amazon video on demand and it sucked. Suffered through lips moving and no sound coming out but cute story.
4,ghosts of girlfriends past,"Ghosts of girlfriends past is not suppose to be anything but fun. Everyone quit being so afraid to be yourselves. It doesn't matter what anyone says. If you like something have fun! Does anyone remember FUN. Enjoy every min you can. This film is a great background movie. But then I liked Sahara. It also was just fun. Lighten up hug each other, your children. anyone who needs support. Ask for a hug if you need one. It is not weak to feel the most powerful thing on Earth, Love. Peace to all of us."
5,Movie,I love this movie!! A Christmas classic in my opinion!!! Movie arrived ahead of schedule. Fun for the grown ups in the house to watch.
2,Pretty lame...,"So, I had a feeling I wouldn't like this movie. It looked pretty lame. And Matthew has been in a series of lame movies recently (Fool's Gold, Failure to Launch, Sahara, etc.) It's such a shame that Matthew went from what I thought was a stellar performance in Contact (of course, it was truly a well written script AND I think he did lots of great things with his role) to this. It's one giant cliche, really obvious plot lines, and for no point. And don't get me wrong, I can imagine how difficult it must be to write a romantic comedy in this day and age when there's been thousands that have gone before. It's hard to be original. And likewise, it's hard for an actor to do something that hasn't been done before (or at least not done a lot of in the past). Tons of history and precedence. But at some point, the question should go from, ""How can we make this different?"" to ""Should we even bother?"" If that had been the litmus test for this movie, I suspect it wouldn't have been made at all."
4,Jealousy is the key to anger,"Anna is jealous of her older sister, Kimberly. She realizes that her parents are always mad at her and always proud of Kimberly. She also hates that her sister is always so patient with her and that she rarely gets mad at her. Anna tries to be like her sister, but she just can't do it. Hey - what do you expect from a girl that collects dead flies? When she looks at her sister, all she sees is perfection. When she goes to school, she acts different, but comes to realize that she can only be herself because that's the Anna everyone likes. As her life moves on through the story, she realizes that her sister isn't perfect, and at that moment, it's her time to shine!"
3,It's a mystery how some of these answers were created,"I *love* those figure-it-out mystery stories, where you have to riddle through a situation and figure out what happened. I was very disappointed, however, when I grabbed this book to entertain myself for an evening. The stories themselves are relatively interesting, but when it comes down to figuring out whatever the question is, their conclusions are at time questionable and in some cases downright wrong. The leaps of logic they make to deduce their answers are simply not reasonable. I'd bypass this one and look to some of the other offerings out there."
1,Absolutely NOT WORTH BUYING!,"I love reading mysteries, especially the type where you get to figure out the mystery by looking at the clues. I have read books like this before and I was hoping to be quite entertained by this book. Personally, I can't even understand why somebody would allow this garbage to be published. The answers are not very accurate and in some cases downright stupid. This is the worst book of this type I have ever read. Not only was it badly edited, but it is not even very cohesive. I can't see a child or adult liking this. If it were possible to give this book ZERO STARS I would."
5,A Definite Keeper,"I have read several books on the craft of TV drama development, and this one is by far the most comprehensive and helpful. As someone who doesn't have access to the great writing instructors of the left coast, this book is essentially my drama writing class. ""Writing the TV Drama Series"" is a wonderful A to Z look at what to expect in the rough and tumble world of professional television writing. Thanks, Pamela, for sharing your expertise with us!"
5,Writing the TV Drama Series,"I love this book. It's the first one that told me the truth about how television shows really work and how to write for them. And it has such a conversational, friendly style I wanted to keep reading."
5,One of the Best,"I've read many, many books on writing for film and television, and this is one of the best ones. Worth twice the cover price!"
2,A letdown compared to Chupacabra,"Imani Coppola is without a question a great musician. Her debut was quite brilliant, offering a kaleidoscopic menu of samples and musical styles combined with snappy lyrics...all in all the type of CD that just doesn't grow old. On Afrodite, while the musicianship is tight, the adventurousness that made the first CD great is gone. The album does have a couple of tracks that got my attention, but it's mostly hard funk with a couple of inane ballads thrown in. It reminds a little of Prince's most recent effort, which got great reviews, but I ended up reselling after spinning it a few times. I'm afraid this CD will meet the same fate."
3,Back with a change.,"When I heard Imani Coppola FINALLY made a new record, I had to buy it (even if it meant importing it since it's not available in Europe...). I'm a huge fan of ""Chupacabra"", its ""Put a smile on my face"" catchy tunes. So when I first listened to ""Afrodite"", it was at first a disappointement since it's quite totaly a différent style, I would say quite ""darker"". Not that the songs aren't good, just ""different""! After more listening, it's beginning to sink in, so I put 3 stars 'cause I'm so glad she's back but I have to spend more time on it, I would say this album is ""more difficult""."
3,It's okay....,Not exactly the best book there is to learn linear algebra but it works. I suppose it's more of a supplementary book. I would recommend getting this book as an extra in case your current book isn't sufficient for you. It's quite a dull book in my opinion.
2,A poorly written book,I use this for a linear algebra class. I found that the answers in the back of the book difficult to use and sometimes wrong. There are better books for this type of class.
3,I'm sure it's great...,"but I wouldn't know since I ordered it Feb 8, 2007 and still don't have it. Amazon now says I won't receive it until May 4, 2007. That's a nearly 12 week delay - ridiculous. I included the year 2007 on the dates because the way it's going it might change to 2008. Be very prepared to wait and don't expect much explanation from Amazon."
4,It Needed Something More,"Johnson has written a very different post-apocalypse novel compared with the normal fare. I really enjoyed the first part of the book, but the latter sections didn't draw me in nearly as much. While it's fine to leave some loose ends in this type of book, he left too many.I really feel this should have been twice as long so he could more completely construct his world. I still rated it four stars for the inventive language and writing."
2,Works Ok But Small Shredded Paper Receptacle,This shredder works fine but it has a very small shredded paper receptacle requiring constant emptying. The unit is ok if you just have a small amount of shredding to do each month.
2,Fails to live up to its potential,"While the idea of this album --paying tribute to the influence of Stephen Foster on American musical history-- is great, the execution is ordinary at best. The quality of the recording is also not very good- it sounds as if it were recorded at the bottom of a well."
4,An original voice,"This book, and her first, are well-written, informative, and entertaining. It's written from a point of view I hadn't heard before."
4,Actiontec Firewire Card,"I had no problem installing the card (I guess I'm one of the lucky ones). It works, but the video editing software that comes with it is useless. I'm not a pro, but it took me forever to figure out how to input the video, and now I can't figure out how to edit it (it did not come with instructions). I'm going to buy some other software. There were no bad reviews before I bought this product, but after reading the others, I'm glad it worked for me. However, I would be cautious about buying this product due to other's experiences. Good luck."
1,Horrible product with horrible technical support.,"I own an HP Desktop Pavilion that I bought a year ago. I installed this product with no problems by opening up my PC, inserting the PCI card, connecting the power to the PCI card, booting up my PC, and then installing the appropriate driver. I have the Windows 98 Second Edition operating system on my PC.Then I hooked up my Sony DCR TRV 33 mini DV camcorder, of course using the firewire interface. The ActionTec PCI card failed to recognize the camera. ... the cable provided with the product was bad. ... I will never purchase another product from ActionTec again."
1,This product ...,"I purchased this product and have attempted installation on 3 different computers, all failed. The cd wouldn't run at all on computers with windows xp and the software would install but not work on windows 98se. I attempted to contact the compny numerous times and got no response. I tried downloading from their support page but it was useless. I have researced this product online and found that everyone that bought the product couldn't make it work and got no support from the company..."
1,This book sucked,"Don't waste your time, your money, or your patience. The book is not only muddling and confusing, it is condescending and chaotic. I think the author believes she is being clever by trying to force feed the reader (student)a new way of learning straightforward material. In fact, quite the opposite occurs. The reader is often left confused by her puerile examples and her method. She states that a reader doesn't read their way through the book, they learn their way through it. By the end of this book, I knew less about English than I did before I started. If you have this as your course book for any college course, I pity you. Better make plans to study long and hard because this author isn't going to make anything easy for you.I was hoping for more from this book. What a waste of time and effort."
1,Authored by incompetent person.,"I have no idea how this book was selected as a text for my Business English class. First of all, if you want a good, concise English grammar book, go read ""Elements of Style"" by E.B. White. I wonder what Roberta Moore was thinking when she wrote this book and decided to charge college students [...] for her crap. The contents of the book are not only confusing and mediocre, but also often reflects the conceited nature of this self-proclaimed author. People like her should NEVER author a book. It's because of people like Roberta that Barnes and Nobles are filled with craps."
3,Ok but...,"It was alright for the course but it really should have been alot better. The book can be pretty condesending sometimes in the lessons and some of the names used in sentences are over used like Twileen, what a silly name indeed."
4,Speedy Deliver,"I received textbook before estimated delivery time. There was some minimal writing inside, but overall the book was in good condition."
1,Disgraceful,"This book serves as a shining example of the constant race baiting that the poverty pimps have engaged in, and continue to engage in, over the last thirty years.Refusing to document the reality of society by stating such profound premises as ""white reality is different than black reality"", this book is trash.You would be better served by one of Thomas Sowell's works on race."
4,GREAT 1950'S L.A. DOO-WOP,"EBB RECORDS WAS AN L.A. BASED INDY LABEL IN THE 1950'S THAT MADE R&B ROCK AND ROLL. SOME OF THE SONGS ARE MORE WELL KNOWN THAN OTHERS (BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ BY THE HOLLYWOOD FLAMES, FOR ONE), BUT ALL OF THE SONGS ARE GREAT VOCAL GROUP HARMONY NEVERTHELESS. IF YOU LIKE OLD DOO-WOP FROM THE 50'S YOU WILL ENJOY THIS CD. STRANGELY ENOUGH, THERE IS ALSO ONE SONG ON THIS CD, ""LIVE LIKE A KING"" WHICH IS AN ELVIS SOUNDALIKE. VERY FUNNY!"
5,Best playability!,"One of the most fun sets I've had the pleasure of building. The modularity of the ship enhances its playability. Simply remove a section (or drop it off on the planet!) and you've got a whole new ship. The rover is very cute, and the design is very reminicent of the Space Shuttle. One of LEGO's most fun models."
4,A Strong Cold War Read!!!,"Mr. Smith has managed to bring to vivid life the era of the Cold War with his fast-paced action read ""Black Sea Monster.""Karl Bauer is a merchant seaman for East Germany. When he participates in a rescue at sea he has no idea what he's actually gotten involved in. Not even in his wildest dreams did he imagine he would be in the thick of things by attempting to foil a Soviet plot. But, this is not the only way his life is going to change. His reaction to one lady is going to bring him some trouble. Will Karl be able to defect to the West or will he get caught up in the political backlash of someone elses making?Mr. Smith has crafted a very believable and likeable lead. This story reminded me a little bit of ""Hunt for Red October"" with his own twist and turns. If you are a fan of military action reads then this fast paced read will be perfect. This is truly a high velocity read that will appeal to almost every kind of reader."
1,Bad Translation,"This review is for this version of the book, NOT the novel. This translator uses sentences which do not make a whole lot of sense. I was completely frustated when I had to re-read several sentences many times just to grasp what he was saying. I prefer the Penguin Classics version, translated by Pevear and Volokhonsky."
5,Christmas Gift,"This book was purchased for my grandson, age 16. He is very interested in reading Tolstoy but he had been unable to buy Anna Karenenia because of the cost. When I learned of this, I searched Amazon and found it at a very reasonable cost. He was so very excited when he received it. He was adopted as a baby from Moscow."
2,i wouldnt buy it.,War and peace was brilliant. Anna Karenina isn't. Her character may be complex but it's nothing extraordinary. This book is not a tragedy -- anyone as confused as anna should die asap. Her son's slow and forced forgetting of her is a lot more interesting than her but only occupies a page or two out of 600. There's only one passage here worth looking at for language's sake -- the description of what she sees when she kills herself.
4,Promising,"Arrived with a thumb print on side of cover and creases on lower corners. Maybe this occurred from being pushed into mailbox by carrier. This is a gift for an intellectual grandson who is interested in reading classics. I am also interested, from reading the first few pages online."
2,slow moving and boring.,"good to have the footnotes at the end of each chapter. If you have to plow through this tale, I would recommend this translation."
5,Ibrhim and his Buenos Hermanos have done it again!,"If I could use one word to describe this album it would be SUBLIME!Although there are some dancing tunes, the artistry with which they are executed elevates your soul to a higher level. The theme selection is a mix between beautiful traditional cuban songs like ""Perfume de Gardenias"" and some more contemporary creations like ""Boliviana"" by the always wonderful Chucho Valdez. As well as Ibrahim's first recording, this second incursion into cuban grooveland is an elegant album which clearly reflects the rooted cuban swing of the members of Buenavista Social Club.In summary, a highly recommended title for both, the expert cuban music listeners, and for the genre amateurs."
3,"Should been better, CO`O!","This record is not bad, but it does not carry the quality of the first one. The selection of songs could have been better(I MEAN IT), on top of this the producers have tried to introduce a new unique sound that does not stay legitimate to that of 50's cuban music(and no,I am not talking of an accompaniment that makes it sound better).Ibrahim Ferrer sings, sounds great, and knows what he is doing sadly the producers don't. If you already own the firts album then this one might be of interest, but if you don't own none of his solo records then stay out of this one and get the firt one. The firt record contains great cuban classics, more variation, songs of higher quality, good band, and has a stronger identity of cuba's golden era."
2,A Quick Read,"Worth the time for a quick start; I knew nothing about Belgium when I started reading. The strength of the Xenophobe guides is their short coverage, rather than the insights of the Culture Shock! series. I read this one in about 40 minutes, and it helped me understand some of the key issues among the Belgians. It covered current issues, with very little history, and provided enough background to appreciate some basic aspects of Belgian culture. Although a little light-hearted in its discussion, I feel comfortable passing it on to a Belgian friend."
3,gina d join the fun,"the video is fine, I just thought it would be more than 3 episodes because it says Vols. 1,2,3. I guess I should have read the description closer."
4,Double 12 Volt Socket,"Have Two places to plug in your MP3, voltage Tester or GPS where you once only had one."
2,cig. lighter adapter,The item received wasn't what was listed but I did receive a very quick credit and am very happy with the seller.
2,Lighter plug,This lighter plug did not work with my auto lighter plug. It keeps falling off because the shaft is to long when plugging it in. It will work with a deeper well socket.
2,Did not fit in my car 12V socket,"The shaft is too long for my 12V socket and it would not snap in far enough to engage the metal tabs on the side of the adapter. In my Nissan when I try to push it in it does not go in far enough to hold and snaps back out. In my Chevy it goes in deeper and works for a while, but the shaft is still too long and if I hit a bump it sometimes springs back out and loses contact."
4,A Heady Blend of Philosophies,"Judith shows mastery of important ancient and modern philosophies. In plain language, she spins together many interesting and multicultural ingredients to formulate a cure for the planet. Her recipe is optimistic, but provocative - a great basis for dialogue."
1,Terrible! Completely Biased. Inaccurate. One-sided.,"I heard about bias in academia but that did not prepare me for this book. The bias and political agenda of the authors was so apparent it was insulting to read. They leave out information that does not support their agenda and dismiss little inconviences like the Constituion. Do not belief, for one second, that you are getting balanced information or an accurate representation of party views. This is a sophmoric demonization of everyone the authors don't agree with and the promotion to sainthood of everyone on they do agree with. This book was used for a Masters program but it will most likely be replaced. Strangely enough, most grad students want to make up their own minds."
4,excellent introduction in the United States Congress,"""Congress and Its Members"" is an excellent textbook for any government student wanting a thorough introduction into the actions and events of the United States' Senate and House of Representatives. The discussion found in the book ranges from the differences between the two houses, their procedures, methods of governance, etc... This book is very easy to read and comprehend what the authors convey."
4,"Excellent textbook, lots of examples, and a good read","If you are looking for a textbook for upper-division classes on Congress, this is the one. It is thorough, full of interesting stories and examples, it's not too long, and it's easy to read. Oh, and it has lots of pictures! If you want to know how the US Congress works, this is the best text I've seen."
4,Good introductory textbook on Congress.,"I read this book as the textbook for a course atthe University of Maryland. It is a good text that explains how Congress works. It is very well organized, and tells how bills become law, how members are elected, and the procedures ofCongress.It also contains some humorous anecdotes; however, I did not find the book to be particularly gripping."
1,freaking rip offffff :),i can go to the supply store and get those pumps alot less cheaper. you want to sell a used B&G series 100 for $199 i can get a brand new one for that price
5,Fabolous,"Cesar Vallejo is a poet for all times, interconnected to the stars - and the earth. The translation of his poems in this book seems to be very adequate."
5,He really is unlimited,"God Unlimited is awesome. Especially if you are someone who has the idea that God should fit in ""the box"" but you wish He didn't. Norman Grubb is very good about making things clear."
2,Reef Fishes of the Red Sea,"This text was a great disappointment in a number of respects. It covers only the most common of reef fishes in the Red Sea, with many omissions. The photos are small. Most are about 3""x2"", with some as small as 1 1/2""x1"". The photo quality varies, and a number of them are taken against backgrounds or in light conditions which obscure the fish. Some of the pictures are a frank embarrassment. For example, the Blackfin Barracuda on page 177 & Red Sea Houndfish on page 179 are nearly indecipherable. Which particular fish are given any meaningful description appears capricious, are few & far between, and the detail provided is generally very scanty. Fish with multiple possible names are often identifed using only one.In my opinion, the text by Helmut Debelius, ""Red Sea Reef Guide,"" with 321 pages (compared to only 192) & over 1000 (compared to only perhaps 350)large, high quality photos, and costing just $2.49 more, is a far superior value."
1,Not helpful,The video adds nothing to the Garmen instructions. Not worth the price...just read your manual.
4,A good esoteric study of christianism!,"Annie Besant was President of Theosophical Society at the beginning of 20th century. Theosophy, however concerned by all religions, is based at the origin on hindouism and buddhism teachings. It is in this context that this book takes all its interest. Annie Besant tells us about secret teachings that were given to early christians and that was hidden by the church. Jesus Christ is described as a great master of the great white brotherhood and as one the humanity great teachers such as Buddha Siddarta or Krishna. Whatever the truth is, what impressed me, is that the author gives some good esoteric interpretations of christian rituals such as water baptism or eucharisty. She develops further some initiatic subjects such as redemption, sacrifice, god trinity, sins forgiveness and much more. My conclusion is that it is a good esoteric study of christianism!"
5,Kingston Card Reader with 1 gb sd card,"I just bought a new digital camera that uses sd cards. I was coming from a compact flash system. So, I didn't want to spend alot of money on a new card reader. I did a quick online search and found this one and it also came with a 1 gb card for around $18. I couldn't beat it for the price. I didn't want to go no brand. I plugged it in the usb jack and I am up and running. All very easy. The only weak part is the construction of the plastic door flap. If you have a kid or wife, they will probably break it, you must be careful."
5,best damn thumbdrive i've seen,best thumbdrive i have ever owned. Even has a small storage card to easily and concisely store all my data
2,Looks like a bedazzled paper clip,"The ""simulated diamond cut"" looks a lot prettier in the picture than it does in person. In the picture, there is at least a vague semblance of diamonds. The actual product, however, does not have the appearance at all. Instead, it looks like a fancy paper clip.On a positive note, they are lightweight and would not drag down your earlobes."
4,Mixture of Season 1 and 2!,"We have never seen Season 1 of the Doodlebops and it is quite different than Season 2. This DVD has 2 episodes from Season 1 and 2 from Season 2. The Doodlebops look different in the first season and there is a ""Mazz"" and not a ""Jazz"" (Jazz is way better!!!) In Season 1, the Bops wear mask like head gear with fake ears which makes them a lot stiffer and freakier. Deedee's dress is different too. Bottom line, Season 1 does not hold my 2 year old's attention as well. I wish I had known it was a mixture of both seasons as I might have held off. However, for the price, it is still good entertainment! We love Rooney!"
5,For Doodlebops fans mostly,"My two year old daughter became a fan of this group since she was about six months old. She has four of their DVDs, and she loves them all. However, I find that kids that have not previously seen the TV programs show little interest for the Doodlebops, so the DVD might be good for kids already familiar with the group, but not so good for those who have no idea of who these guys are."
5,Gripping and convicting,"I am continually reminded that there is ""nothing new under the sun."" I recently read the book ""Radical"" by David Platt and included a quote recently while teaching. Afterward someone approached me and asked me if I would be interested in reading an old book he had which dealt with the same topic. This book is a gripping story, written in an older style, centering around the life and times of a pastor in the 1800's to early 1900's. The message or moral of the story will challenge you to consider your life and how you are spending it. I challenge you to pick it up and though it was written many years ago to a much more conservative audience it is just as relevant today."
4,Weird view of the future,"The basic plot is that a man dies, is frozen for 500 years and is eventually revived to find... Contrary to the previous review, the joymaker (not joybringer) is an incidental part of the story, just a gadget that lets you communicate with the master computer (among other things). The real story is about the effect on society of a combination of affluence and ""death reversal"" technology (making them bold in some ways and wimps in other ways). It kept my attention, but was really odd.One unusual part of the book is that it includes an afterward by the author to convince us of the soundness of his proposed future (the book was written in 1968). He justifies all kinds of details, including aliens, but leaves out any mention of what to me was the most ill-conceived part of the book, the future attitude towards murder."
3,premise better than story,I remembered the front and back matter and the story of how he projected the technology from the first dial up computer access. I just didn't care much for the story itself.
3,Because I was spoiled before with a Nakamichi receiver...,"this Onkyo pales in comparison. It is servicable and clean sounding but unfortunately has a tinny, sharp sound. Not much in the way of warmth or depth, even after messing with the bass and treble controls. BUT for the $ ( as my 15 yr old Nakamichi died, despite 2 trips to the repair shop) it is worth it. The customer service from One Call ( where I bought mine via Amazon) is top notch, I had concerns ( no sound came out , intermittant problem, seems to be OK now) and they were very helpful and willing to take return. I decided to keep it, as the price was so wonderful and the sound, as I said, is decent and clear, but I plan to save up and eventually get a receiver that plays with more warmth and depth. This is perfectly fine to tide me over. I would recommend it, just know that there is a sharp, mechanical tinge to the sound."
5,Better than a shelf system,"This is my Dad's profile, but I just want to say that this is a really good basic receiver if you just want to hook up a cd player and tape deck. My parent were generous enough to buy me one and I've never had any problems with it except for FM reception. This is a great deal."
4,A very good book for the beginning investor,I recommend The 7 secrets of financial success to anyone who wants to learn the basics of investment and debt. I find it to be an invaluable reference. Worksheets help you figure out your financial situation and help you begin saving.
1,Not what I expected,"I am really disappointed with this book. It was nothing like I expected. I was hoping for prayer starters for a variety of occasions, this is not that."
2,poor vent,The ventilation did not perform as well as headsweats. It felt like heat was being trapped. Which is not good because it felt like heat stress was setting in.
4,This book highlights the sociopolitical aspect of TG,"This book highlights the sociopolitical aspect of transgender.The author says the ultimate solution of transgender is the change of USA's bipolarism society.In Japan, I think the situation is somewhat different.The bipolarism and homophobia are not so strong.Rather,the phobia for SRS is very strong.The reason is Japanese think the body is as important as the soul and cutting off the part of the body is sinful. So , this book also gave me a chance to think the cultural differences between the two countries."
5,Best Calorie Counting Book EVER,"I had a copy of this book for decades, but finally threw it away because I wore it out!. It is comprehensive and has normal measurements, such as ""cups"" or ""teaspoon,"" not ""medium"" or ""grams."" I figured I would just go buy a new, but different book, but I could not find a good one. The one I did buy aggravated me so much I looked online to see if there was an updated version of my ""old friend."" There was! Nothing compares to this book. Thanks, Amazon!"
5,Barbara Kraus' Calories and Carbohydrates,I had an older copy that was worn so I purchased this one to replace.You know I like it because I worn one out and bought a new one.
2,Good information if you only eat packaged food,"I was really disappointed with this book. I bought it on recommendation of my doctor. I really don't eat a ton of packaged food and things that I would expect to see listed here are not. It seems fairly complete if you eat out at fast food restaurants and use a lot of pre-packaged foods, which I do not. It also doesn't include any food that might be on a more sophisticated palette. I'm no food snob, but I do go out to dinner at nicer restaurants and I would have hoped some of those types of dishes would be listed on this book. Overall, I didn't find it very useful for my purposes."
5,I didn't even know what they were,"I saw this zip-lock kinda bag in a drawer and grabbed one to put a lettuce in, did not know what they were specifically I though, zip-lock need one ! did not know my wife had bought them, well that was July 7 and the lettuce is still fresh in the vegetable drawer of the fridge today is July 31! amazing! put some lemons in another one one week and counting"
1,DON'T DO IT!!,"THIS PRODUCT DID NOT KEEP ANY OF MY FRUITS OR VEGETABLES FRESH, IN FACT THEY SEEMED TO SPOIL MUCH QUICKER THAN NORMAL. I TRIED PRODUCTS IN AND OUT OF THE REFRIGERATOR, AND NONE OF THEM STAYED FRESH AS LONG AS THEY WOULD HAVE NORMALLY STAYED FRESH. I EVEN PUT THEM ON A WHOLE FRESH BATCH OF GREEN BANANAS AND THEY ALL SPOILED BEFORE I COULD EAT THEM. WHEN THE BANANAS SPOILED, IT WASN'T A GRADUAL RIPENING LIKE NORMAL BANANAS, BUT THEY LOOKED LIKE REFRIGERATED BANANAS WOULD HAVE LOOKED. AWFUL PRODUCT, AND VERY DISAPPOINTING TO MY FAMILY. WE WERE LOOKING FORWARD TO USING THIS, BECAUSE OF TGHE VOLUME OF FRESH FRUITS AND VEGGIES WE CONSUME, BUT WE HAD TO THROW EVERYTHING OUT. BY THE WAY, THIS ALL HAPPENED ABOUT 3 DAYS AFTER PUTTING THE FRESH PRODUCE IN THE BAGS."
5,Best fruits and vegetables storage,"I would like to rate this product 5 stars. This is the first time that I used this fresh bag and it really makes your fruit and vegetables fresh for a long time. I have my tomatoes, celery, carrots, etc. wrapped in this bag and it will stay fresh for more than two weeks. I would like everybody to try this product and you will not regret it."
3,"Good for some things, but not everything","This has worked great with lettuce, herbs that I let dry awhile before putting in the bag, peppers. But, I had a cut cucumber in one and it rotted quite quickly. The uncut cuke did not rot. The cut peppers also did not rot, so I guess it depends on the vegetable.Also, I stored some limes in a fruit basket in a bag and my impression is they rotted more quickly than if I had just let them sit.But they are definitely worth it for lettuce and fresh herbs."
2,Not as advertised,"These were OK in the fridge, but as far as keeping anything fresh for extended periods outside the fridge. Don't put too much faith in the commercial on TV. And as far as keeping anything fresh for ""up to 30 days""; forget it. In my experience in the fridge 8 or 9 days tops. out of the fridge 5, maybe 6 days."
3,Disappointed in quantity - not quality of bags,"I have to agree with the two reviewers who talked about receiving 20 bags instead of 30 as expected. I have used Evert-Fresh Green bags for many years with great results, and after searching unsuccessfully for an exact number of bags included in the product description, also assumed I was purchasing 30 bags, since they are marketed in Large, Medium, and Small. Upon receiving the bags, I was disappointed to discover there were only 20, and no large bags. Love the product - the bags arrived in good time and condition, but I did feel ripped off about the description and quantity."
1,Only 20 Bags!!!,"PLEASE NOTE that this product is very misleading! The Evert Fresh (also known as Debbie Meyers) green bags come in three sizes, cleverly called Small, Medium, and Large. Other sites sell 30 bags (10 of each size) for $21 (including postage). I ASSUMED this package would include 30 bags, HOWEVER, this set includes only 10 small and 10 medium bags!! The individual prices would be less than the $19.95 charged for this set. I think the bags are great but this ""set"" is a complete rip off. Buy your bags elsewhere."
1,Not As expected,"I really wanted to like this product because I love pre-ripe bananas, but this product changed the smell and taste of the bananas. The bags had a funny smell before I placed and sealed the bananas in the bag. The bananas overnight were changed to a bitter, unpleasant flavor. When I wrote to the vendor about this, he said 'make sure to dry the fruit before it is put into the bag', which makes sense, but the fruit had been dry. Condensation formed in the bag overnight and never left. The odor of the plastic bag made the bananas smell and taste rancid. Too bad. It's a great idea!"
1,Not Debbie Meyers,"Don't know what happened to Debbie Meyers bags, but these are stiffer and don't seem to be any better than what is now being given in many produce departments."
5,"""Definately a Keeper!""","Superb travel companion for anyone visting or revisiting ""The Big Apple."" (NYC). A nice addition to any travel/tourism library."
1,"Discovering Black New York: A Guide to the City's Most Important African American Landmarks, Restaurants, Museums, Historical Si","I've been trying to get my hands on a copy of Discovering Black New York: A Guide to the City's Most Important African American Landmarks, Restaurants, Museums, Historical Sites, but the price just keeps getting higher and higher. I spoke to the author and she only has 4 copies left to her name and would not part with any. She says that the historical data is the most important and that the restaurants should be called first since business is swift(my word) in NYC. I sure hope that she produces another guide book so that the madness of the over inflated price wars grinds to a screeching halt.I Never was crazy about history, I told her so, now I am curious about her book. This book gets one star reserved until I read it for myself and not at this inflated price. Amazon's price is the bargain."
3,"nice, but not durable","These are cute books which my son (14 months) loves to see and play with. The tape holding the wooden pages together, however, needs serious work. We are now using strapping tape to keep our books (we have three of these) in one piece. That was a bit disappointing."
5,The perfect fusion of country and rock!!,"This is a toe tappin' album interspersed with some great country love songs. This should have been one of the top albums of it's day. But it's like Frank Zappa said, ""Most people wouldn't know good music if it came up and kicked them right in the ---."""
4,Best reunion album,"There have been colossal failures in the past when former bandmates get together after long years to record a reunion album. This isn't one of them. In fact, it may be the best. Not every song is a winner and perhaps half of the tunes are mediocre at best but there are real gems here. The first half of the cd is terrific. Meisner and Young really stand out but the real treasure is in the superb musicianship. ""Nature of Love"" and ""Rough Edges"" are fine rockers. ""Call it Love"" and ""Nothing to Hide"" are great pop tunes. Take a chance on this one, it won't disappoint."
5,another treasure from poco,"Just another great Poco cd,what can I say?I bought this after reading customers reviews.I`m glad I did.These guys could play and harmonize with anybody.Should`ve been huge."
5,loving it,i LOVE this album from beginning to end...with my favorite songs being alteration and using the word...well worth a listen...
5,Best debut of the year!,"With a bunch of quality melodic death bands like Diabolical and Enter My Silence, there's tough competition for the top new band, and i think this band takes the cake. The sound is somewhat like a cross of Children Of Bodom and At The Gates, with the lush keyboards of the former with the more aggressive sound of the latter. sounds good, doesn't it? well it is! (...) :)"
4,"Like CoB, but darker","There are some REALLY good songs on this album, my particular favorites are Alteration and Hades. That being said you might feel like youre listening to Children of Bodom when you listen to this at times. Although Kalmah has a much darker sound and they use blastbeats (which is awesome) their vocalist really blows. Even if I was really into black metal I'd say he sucks. Luckily, I don't care about vocals that much anyway. The guitar solos demonstrate talent but are otherwise pretty generic. The real gold is the songwriting, although repetitive at times, these guys write some really nice melodies."
4,Surprisingly good,"I had seen this cd many times on the shelves but disregarded it because of the cheesy death metal image (monster-like illustration on the cover, photo of long haired, black wearing, mean looking dudes standing in a dark forest or something like that, etc). However when the guy at the cd store told me to give it a try I was surprised how good the band is. It is in the same league as C.of Bodom, Norther, Withering Surface, illnath, ... You can hear every note and every beat of the drum despite the speed and brutality of the music. I haven't heard the other albums but I was told this is their best release. Well worth your money, give it a try."
2,cradle?,"Yes this album sounds like cradle of filth without the extreme high pitch notes on the vocals. If you like cradle, you should like this. Not my cup of tea though."
5,All Hail Kalmah,"The moment I heard Kalmah, I was in complete awe of the guitars...AMAZING! Europeans really know their stuff when it comes to Metal. The rest of the band is incredible too. Though, I've never been a HUGE fan of Death Metal vocalists, Kalmah's vocals blend in with the instruments very nicely. These guys play like they've been playing together FOREVER and they've only released 3 albums (as of now). Get this album or miss out on hearing my new Favorite band."
2,Missing RCA input for record,"I ordered this online, but I didn't even plug it in before I realized that it has RCA video out, but no RCA video in. It can only record off of the antenna. This wouldn't work for what I needed, so I had to return it."
3,Not Enough!,"Liked the whole idea of an EastEnders compilation, but this wasn't enough EastEnders. There needs to be a entire series of DVD's to sate the appetite of those of us without it on TV!"
2,For Women Only,"British sitcom that tries too hard to be funny, edgy, and spicy all at once. This ""retrospective"" has the girls in jail reminiscing all the ups and downs of their last few years. It covers a lot of heavy topics such as child rape, spousal abuse, death, infidelity, etc. My major gripe is that men are all portrayed as devils, buffoons, or cowards."
1,Theta Meditation System,Two CD's were included in this set. They were not the original CD's which should have come under this title. I am very disappointed with this order and I cannot find a way to return it via the website.
2,mostly noise,"When you read something like ""Renew Your Spirit, Gain Insight, and Intuition"" it should immediately raise the red flag. Somebody is selling snake oil in mp3 format. This so called music is more of an annoying noise. Do yourself a favor spend that money on some quality classical music. You'll get a whole lot more enjoyment."
4,Track 2 First,"I highly reccomend any of Dr. Jeffrey's CD's to anyone over-high priced competitors. My one suggestion for anyone buying this CD is if you are going to use it FOR MEDITATION PLAY TRACK 2 FIRST!!! I say this due to a slightly mischievious piper solo about 10 minutes into the first track. This could be distracting at for unwinding. However, I recomend using this CD at night to increase chances of lucid dreaming. Always play track 2 first."
4,Research before you review. . .,"I haven't actually listened to this CD yet but I just wanted to point out to ""smackpixi"" that the idea of brainwave entrainment and the specific target ranges given are not ranges you are supposed to hear -- they are the ranges of activity your brain produces when listening to them, as read by the EEG. A binaural beat, say at 400Hz and at 405Hz (tones you CAN hear), laced within the music causes the brain to produce the difference in values -- 5Hz -- as seen on an EEG. You are NOT supposed to be listening for it, as ""smackpixi"" pointed out, you are physically incapable of that. Perhaps everyone should read up a little more on the subject before making criticisms."
2,Theta CD,It is too short. It is relaxing but it has to be rerun constantly to get into a deeper relaxed state. I am disappointed with it.
5,wonderful!,I have bought several guided imagery cd's for relaxation and have found the voices on them to be irritating or the content to be kinda stupid. So I bought some nature sounds like ocean waves etc and found them to be relaxing but not exactly trance inducing. This cd is amazing. At first it just sounds like a new age cd but when you use it to meditate it pulls you in to a state of very deep relaxation. My whole body felt tingly. I don't think I have ever felt so at peace. I plan on buying all his cd's and using them every day!!!
5,An magnificant recording!,"This cd set delivers the goods. If you're looking to improve your creativity, enhance your meditations, gain insight or just relax, then you owe it to yourself to get this recording. It just may change your life."
3,Not the best,"I found the tracks too upbeat for a truly theta experience. For utter transcendence, nothing commercially available beats Synchronicity Contemporary Meditation (Master Charles) for a true out of body experience."
4,overall good,"I have listened to this CD several times. There are 2 tracks. I really don't like the first one overall. The tones and flute sounds, etc seem more of a distraction and it just doesn't do it for me until almost the end of the track. The second track however I think is fantastic. Perhaps the first track is just to warm you up so you are relaxed for the second? Anyhow by the end of the CD you are in a pretty deep state of meditation."
4,Great for meditation,"There are two CDs in this set: The first contains music that can be a little bit distracting while you're meditating, but I found that it's good for studying. The second, designed to put you deeper into Theta, will keep you sitting lotus style until your legs cramp up, and then some. Be aware that these recordings work by syncing your left and right brain, and that means that you need headphones for the maximum effect. But if you are like me, easily distracted by stray thoughts during meditation, then these recordings will help with your focus."
2,Not Holosync,"I purchased this item hoping it might be half as good as Holosync by Centerpointe. I have to say I was disappointed. The music is mediocre and the effects were for me, were not apparent."
2,THERE IS NO BOOK AND 2ND CD IS FAULTY,"A FOLD OUT INSERT IN THE BOX IS HARDLY A ""BOOK"" AND THE SECOND CD HAS A BUILT IN SCRATCHING SOUND FOR ABOUT 1O MINUTES...OTHERWISE ITS OKAY BUT I THINK THE SET IS MISREPRESENTED."
2,Colorless reading of some grim stories,"To me, the Brothers Grimm's stories are always too grim (pun intended) for children, even for adults. They lack the fine taste and originality in Andersen's tales. Still, they're classics, so I bought this CD set along with the Andersen 2CD set, also from Naxos, for my kids.While this set has the recording volume right, the voice actress is unfortunately quite colorless and boring, making the grim stories even grimmer. My kids don't like these audio stories, and I don't blame them. So we haven't listened to these again since we bought them nearly 3 years ago.Get the Andersen CD set, even though the recording volume on that set leaves much to be desired."
4,Great but could be better.,There must be a problem with indexing at White Wolf and their various gaming systems. This book is quite good at explaining the Camarilla clans and giving insights to how they really operate. But it is poorly indexed. Also I think that WhiteWolf needs to make a bigger character sheet or have more blank lines for abilities and disciplines since they keep expanding what your character can learn. A guide to how to use these new things with older abilities would be helpful too.
5,Get a better inside view,Most Vampire players are aligned with the Camarilla. This book helps the storyteller and players understand their world a whole lot better.
1,Demo applications don't work,"This book has a serious flaw. It includes a demo version of ProfileMaker, which you need to use to create profiles in Lesson 4. Unfortunately, the demo version doesn't actually allow you to create profiles, so you can't complete the lesson! In other words, you really can't use this book unless you spends hundreds more on various software and hardware to actually do the color management."
1,Spend the Money for a Better One,"Simply said, If you want a quiet dehumidifier - don't consider this one. If you want one that removes even several drops of water after running for eight hours - don't buy this one. If you want one with a digital humidistat for setting and / or monitoring - don't buy this one. Just spend a little more money and go to your local Sears / Home Depot / Lowes. This unit has been returned to Amazon by me..."
2,Just Terrible,"Just terrible. It's like trying to get two Panda bears in captivity to mate. If the planets aren't aligned properly, the temperature is too high , or if the Gods are angry it won't work. I did get it to work a couple of times by standing on one foot while rubbing my stomach. It's actually easier and quicker to run back and forth to change your settings. Good Luck!"
1,Good concept but weak remote range,"Most of this product works as it should: the transmitter and receiver do allow you to greatly extend the range of your remote and allow you to broadcast the control signal through solid objects. The problem is the range that the *transmitter* has from your remote, which is about four feet. In other words, you can't use your remote more than four feet from the transmitter because it won't pick up the signal: I suppose you could place it on your coffee table or ottoman, but it needs to be plugged in and it would kind of defeat the purpose of having such a piece of equipment. Don't waste your money unless you can be very, very close to the transmitter when using your remote."
1,These are way over rated.,"I bought these to use with my digital camera that has an infrared remote. At night (less obtrusive radio waves), line of site with no obstructions the unit barely worked at 53 feet. When I closed the screen door, or the glass arcadia door in between the units they did not work. I also tried seperating the units with one wall, about 25 feet between the transmitter and receiver. It failed that test also.If they rated these at 50 feet with no obstructions I would give them a good rating, but 100 feet? I think someone is blowing smoke."
1,Useless,"I have this system set up to control my TIVO for viewing in the bedroom. It has about 3 feet and one wall between them, and it works about 10% of the time. I would not recommend this product."
3,does fine...,"Works as advertised. The angle of view for the transmitter is fairly narrow. It isn't as wide as the one that I had before, but seems to work when I find the right angle to aim and shoot."
3,Not bad if you position them perfectly,"These will work as advertised as long as you figure out how to position them perfectly and don't need your remote to operate more than a few feet from them. I have one of them facing my cable box from about 15 feet away, then in the next room I have one on my office desk. However, unless my cable remote is less than about 3-4 feet from the one on my desk and pointed fairly accurately at the receiver, it won't recognize the signal. So just be close to it with your remote and it'll work fine."
1,Terrible!,"Absolutely terrible. The range on the receiver is only a couple of feet at most and has no width to the reception at all. I have to set it on the end of my bed and make sure I am sitting up and leaning close to it in order for it pick up the signal. I know its not my remote because I have much better range when I had the DVD player out in the open, and I can see the IR receiver flashing on my TV 10 feet away indicating its picking up the remotes signal.This is a complete waste of money unless you intend to put the receiver on a end table right next your chair...just remember you will have to turn and point the remote directly at the receiver if you want it to work."
1,Poor Range and Performance,"The transmitter relies on perfect line of sight and only seems to work when within 1 foot of the Transmitter! The manual claims it has a range of 100 feet? Remote IR extender cable has nice velcro attachment, but signal sends out the bottom requiring it to be attached to an *outside* glass door of any entertainment center.After having a great experience with the Leap Frog extender from Terk that truly did have a range of 150 feet -- I'm very disappointed with Jensen. I will be giving them a call tomorrow to give them a chance to at least fix their product or forget it. I'll report more when I hear what they have to say."
1,Junk Junk Junk,"Tried some from Radio Shack and they did not work consistantly. Bought these at Best Buy thinking that they were a good ""brand name."" They were completely useless. They would not even work in the same room. Get the powermid x-10s, they work great."
1,VERY POOR PRODUCT,"Worked well for the first day....since then, we've tried everything, and this thing simply does not work. Poor piece of Chinese made junk. DONT BUY!"
1,THESE SUCK,"EASY SET UP, WORKED GREAT FOR ABOUT 3 DAYS. NOW WILL NOT WORK WITH REMOTE CONTROL MORE THAN 4' FROM TRANSCEIVER, EVEN WITH NEW BATT. IN REMOTE. TOO BAD, NICE SET UP IF THEY WORKED. WILL RETURN THIS SET.OTHER REVIEWERS SUGGEST MODIFICATIONS FOR THOSE PAST RETURN/WARRANTY DATE."
1,"Waste of money, bad product.","This product is pile of junk. They claim it will work 20 ft from the remote. Try SIX FEET, thats the max distance and you have to aim it directly dead center. I'm very disappointed."
4,Works fine for me,"It is important that you lower one attenna, fully extend the other towards the wall outlet into which it is plugged. With those adjusments it works fine. One small matter is that when I turn on my electical light switch in the room where the transmitter is located it causes it to switch off my cable box. I just simple switch it on again."
3,Windows XP,"I do not think there are many systems out there still using XP as an OS, but the book had a number of good web sites and tricks to offer."
5,Nearly every Windows XP topic imaginable,"Paul guides the advanced reader through nearly every Windows XP topic imaginable giving ideas and solutions practical to typical problems encountered by professionals. Here are a few examples: installations, use, and maintenance, performance tuning, optimizing memory, detailed registry info, pushing hardware profiles to their limits, XP system tools, how to build network bridges between dissimilar operating systems, working with compatibility modes to enable older O/S to interact with XP, device driver rollback, automatic driver update, ensuring perfect printing always, and maximizing XP for the internet, intranet, and security. User Level: Intermediate-Advanced. 1000 pp."
4,Fantastic lavalier,"Just bought this for presentation recordings and hooked it up via audio mixer via USB to Laptop, sound is crisp after a few minutes of practice placing it on a jacket/shirt and really helps isolate your voice during instructional scenes. Phantom powered (total novice but read up and worked it out) so needs a mixer/power source for it to work. Great build qulaity, preamp is heavy and sturdy (clippable in back pocket)Hope this helps enjoy!MR"
5,Great Music! Very Heroic!,"To be honest I only bought this CD for two songs which were the Battle of Britain themes. The rest of the songs are great although it's not music that I would just sit around and listen to but the music really flows well with the action of the movie The Battle of Britain which was what it was intended for.I've recently purchased the Battle of Britain on DVD and noticed that they changed the song at the end of the movie when the credits roll. I didn't like that because the Battle of Britain theme sounds much better at the end of the movie and flows much better with Churchill's quote that they also took out of the new DVD version. ""Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many, to so few."" Get the VHS version and you'll see what I'm talking about."
5,"Excellent, readable and easy to understand.","As a synthetic organic chemist with no previous knowledge of fiber optics, I found this book to be very readable and an excellent introduction to the subject. The author has a gift for explaining topics and concepts simply. I have read the book from start to finish in short periods over several weeks and followed it easily. The book is like a very interesting course and I would very much recommend it to anyone who requires or would like an introduction to fiber optics."
5,Excellent job on the Fleagle gang,"Mr. Betz tells the story of the Fleagle gang in a creative writing style, with the use of various reporters of the time period, which made the book very readable and flow well. Betz also goes into the various law enforecment techniques of the time period and various changes in forensic science used to solve crimes and prosecute criminals. This is one book to read if you like the gangsters period of the 1920s. I higly recommend it.Mike Koch, Author of ""The Kimes Gang."""
5,Masterpiece,"Michael Penn absolutely drilled this one!! Each track is a winner, combining wonderful music and Dylanish lyrics. I believe that this one has it all. This has its place in any music collection, because it really is that good."
2,From Satisfied to Disappointed in a Heartbeat,"This is a basic model which served me well for a couples years of very moderate use and no abuse. Today, when I turned it on, however, it automatically goes to standby (which is essentially ""off"") after a few seconds. I can hear a click after a few seconds just as it goes to standby. I looked inside and there are no short circuits and the problem persists even when all other components are disconnected (indicating they are not the problem). I googled the problem and found that it is commonly reported for the Sherwood 4000 and 5000 series receivers. Into the trash it goes because an hour of my time is all I have to waste on this $100 unit."
4,Quite a bargain.,"I needed I stereo reciever for my garage. Nothing too fancy or expensive. This fit the bill. I would not have this as my primary unit in my home, as it's 'bare bones"". But it's just what I was looking for. Works well, sounds fine, great price."
1,static equipment damage hazzard,"My receiver worked fine until I started adjustng the FM wire loop antenna. One end of the 'T' touched the TV screen, where static electricity is always present to some degree. I heard a small snap sound, like when my hand touches the screen (no current so it is not hazzardous to your health), and the receiver stopped receiving the station I was tuned to, and from there on only picked up one station. Not only that, but my directv RCA receiver box to which the receiver is connected via audio cables failed and I had to buy another one, along with returning this receiver for a replacement. Considerng other reviews here, I would dinitely not recommend buying this receiver, even if the price is low."
5,"My new marriage ""bible""","This is a great book written by an author who clearly knows her stuff as a marriage counselor, has been there as a mom/wife, and has a good sense of humor. I found many insights and helpful tips in this book. I wish I had found it sooner, I think it would be great to read before the birth of the baby though it will be helpful for anyone with young kids looking to make positive changes to their marriage. I marked many pages and will be keeping this nearby to revisit and try ideas from."
5,Appropriate for many years to come,"I got this book when I was 13 (in 1985) and now I'm buying it for another 13 year old. Sol Gordon presents the facts in an interesting and colorful way without preaching and without getting too serious. He includes fun and creative exercises in self-analysis and self-appreciation. Most of all, this book is a refreshing read compared to the kinds of scare tactics used to warn kids about sex and drugs today. He encourages kids to use their heads when making decisions that affect them. Although it looks a bit out of date (due to the artwork and slang) it is still right on. Good stuff."
3,Interesting,"If you've never heard Exseption, you'll be surprised. They were (I believe) a very small group with drums, keys and horns and such. Leveraging the early technologies of the day as well as classical chops. Good background music."
3,"An interesting, although dark look at consumerism","In reading this book for a course on gender and consumerism, I found that many of the points the authors made were true, although they tend towards the pessimistic. While criticizing the control aspects of advertising and consumerism, they play into a ""conspiracy theory"" mindset that the same advertising they're criticizing helped to create. A good read overall, but remember to read it, as all things, critically"
3,Not bad for something reprinted from a 1929 book. . .,"Even though it was not what I expected, this was a good book for anyone interested in sailing vessels. This book is a reprint of a book first published in 1929 so it does tend to look outdated with the photos and graphics looking a little blurry and out of focus. But you can tell from the author that this person was written by someone who really loved sailing ships. The written details are full of enthusiasm and knowledge. Despite the limitations of the drawings, this is still a good book for those, like myself, who enjoy reading about old sailing vessels!"
1,Don't be ripped off,"This disc is made up of practice sessions and other second-rate material. It is made from stolen goods and many of the tracks bear only a passing resemblance to the original songs from the LP's. If you are a Starbuck fan at all, you will be hurting them and yourself by buying this product.Instead, go to the artist's site at Moonlight Feels Right dot com, and buy the disc being sold by the original artist, instead of rewarding and encouraging thievery."
4,music for easy-listenings fans,If you are into soft easy-listening music this album is a good choice. I recomend it highly.
2,this is an ok album,"i agree with most of the people that they should wait for the rerelease of ""moonlight feels right"". i liked ""moonlight feels right"" on this album. i feel both versions have something to offer to all listners. both versions seem to have a different sound . after listening to both, i liked both equally. for all of you fans that were growing up in the '70's, i suggest waiting until blakburn gets done with remastering the origials that were on ""moonlight feels right"". i'm a young fan. i was pretty young when ""moonlight feels right"" was released. but, i will tell you this, i waited hours upon hours for the radio to play ""moonlight feels right"". i really love this song very much. In fact, i like the version that is on the backtracks as well. it is all in a matter of taste."
3,"Hey Bruce, You'd Better Start Sueing Away ...","I bought a seventies collection of hits for the sole purpose of acquiring ""Moonlight Feels Right"",(sorry, can't give more specifics). It said on the cover, ""New recordings by original artists."" I can tell by listening to the sample here that we're talking about the same version, (heavy clavinet sound). It seems to be the only version available anymore. I gave it three stars because compared with other ""new recordings"", it's not bad. But if you don't get a handle on it, might down down in history as ""original recording by original artists""!"
1,A real stinker!!,"Being a Starbuck fan from the 70's I was very excited to learn about the release of ""Backtracks"". I bought the CD and was very disappointed. As one might expect from a 70's vintage analog master the quality is poor compared with today's digital technologies. However, the disappointment is not with the analog master but the fact that the tracks have been altered from the original. Starbuck's major hits ""Moonlight Feels Right"" and ""Everybody be Dancin"" resemble the original in melody only. For some unknown reason this CD contains previously unreleased tracks which probably should have remained unreleased.I can only hope that someday the original albums are released, unaltered, in CD format. ""Backtracks"" must certainly be an embarrassment to everyone involved in its production. If your a Starbuck fan, don't waste your money on this ""dog"""
2,TEASE,"I was looking forward to this release, until I realized it was a collection of alternate mixes and demos. I contacted Renaissance about it and they explained the trouble of finding the original masters. Starbuck has such a unique sound, certainly worthy of reissues. Bruce Blackman has a wonderful wry twist in his songwriting, and a killer vocal delivery. It is a ""hip-jive"" style that is tongue-in-cheek, while being actually hip, as well. Great playing and arrangements, especially the vibe and marimba textures. ""Backtracks"" simply acts as a consolation prize, as we wait in the wings for the real thing. It is the old ""better-than-nothing"" scenario. Still, I prefer to make a mini-disc of the two lps I have (need the third, and Korona), and dream.Someday..."
3,Starbuck: Not a bad Atlanta band,"Hi,I am a musician in the Atlanta area. In the 70s, these guys were actually the ""hot dogs"" around town.They were really very good. As a matter of fact, several of the musicians who were in this band are still performing around Atlanta. Although I was into Southern Rock in those days,I loved this song. I still perform around the Southeast, and ""Moonlight Feels Right"" is one of the songs we play through our sound system during our breaks. I don't know what the album sounds like, but the single of ""Moonlight"" is a great pop hit.I am glad it still sells."
2,Not What I Expected,"Bought this CD for Moonlight Feels Right, and neither one listed on CD sounds like the oldie but goodie. The rest seems to be okay, but had I known, I would not have wasted my money."
2,Did not fit.,"GM used two types of cigarette lighter assemblies, a Casco and a Rochester and they are different design. The one I have in my 1991 S10 blazer is a Casco lighter assembly that has a replaceable element but this product does not fit the knob or the receiver. I tossed it and found a good used cigarette lighter knob and element on the internet. I don't smoke but I like everything in my vehicles to work wheather I use them or not.The GM service replacement lighters assembly are Rochesters and you must purchase the receiver and element/knob assembly separately. If you have a Casco lighter assembly, you must replace the receiver to install the complete GM Rochester service replacement lighter assembly. In most cases of an imoperative cigarette lighter, the receiver is not at fault and the element and knob assembly is toast. Never hold a cigarette lighter element in the receiver to get it bright cherry red hot. That will sooner or later blow the fuse, burn out the element or both."
5,Makes me happy every time,"I've had a beat up old copy of this documentary since I was a baby, and believe me, in the 22 years since, I have loved it well! The beautiful (if dated) photography of these wonderful giants is interspersed with excellent educational and conservational information. A must for kids (though maybe fast-forward through the history of whaling) and ANYONE living in the beautiful Bay Area who wants to know our neighbors off the coast."
4,"Good sound, kinda similair to Crystal Method","Definitely worth to buy, althought not all tracks are really good. Smooth slow breakbeat, liquid samples, for me sounds very similair to Crystal Method. Track 9 is a real pearl."
1,BE FOREWARNED......THIS PRODUCT IS HORRIBLE!!!!,"These so-called ""LUMP"" crab cakes from THE CRAB PLACE, were a MAJOR DISAPPONTMENT, to say the least.Rather than tasting like authenic crab cakes from Baltimore, these pulverized patties of overpriced CAT FOOD came to our door looking freezer burned with dark discolorations.I think this is possibly the WORST FOOD VENDOR in Amazon.com's inventory of gourmet foods. When you write to their customer service department some guy name MATT does his best to ignore you, offering nothing in return for all your efforts.Probably made in a GARAGE somewhere in Virginia, this product is surely not worth the rediculous cost per pound they are charging.The only thing THE CRAB PLACE really knows about CRABS......is apparently from an old gym class Personal Hygiene film the owners saw in High School!!!"
1,This is Brook Benton,"I ordered this CD and was very dissappointed as it was not the original recordings of Brook Benton. It sounded like a remake at a later date by an older person, or an earlier release of his most popular songs by a different person. It was certainly not what I anticipated."
3,Might result in vignetting on some cameras,"Yes, it was cheap. And it worked quite well with my Sony HC1. But on my Canon HF M31 and HF M300s, it produced noticible vignetting. A side-by-side comparison against a Sony wide adapter showed prominent vignetting with this adapter and negligable vignetting with the Sony adapter."
4,sirius receiver,"Nice little receiver, If you don't need all the bells and whistles, this receiver will meet your needs. The only complaint I have is the transmitter isn't strong enough to over ride the local radio channels. The direct connect fixed that problem."
5,A 5-Star Product!,"I brought a pair of these for two of my best friends. They loved them and installed them into their cars as soon as I gave it to them.Sirius is affordable and works with you. A great inexpensive gift that I think anyone in the world would love to have in their cars or as gifts.From what I can review, this product is also inexpensive in comparison to XM radio which cost a whole lot more just for the radio tuner alone. Something you may want to look at as well!"
1,Do not recommend this item,I purchased this receiver to replace the one I had for four years that stopped working. This new receiver is not strong enough to block other signals. I have a hard time receiving Sirius signal on a consistent basis. When traveling even 50 miles I have to change frequency. I feel I wasted my money and should have purchased a more expensive model.
4,Great Replacement Radio,"I bought this radio as a replacement for an older, different brand. This model has more features, a bigger, clearer display that offers more info (song title, channel name, artist, the time, etc). It only took a few minutes to install and the antennae works even when it's left inside of my car. I have over 6 different FM frequencies to use in my area so static and distruptions are a thing of the past. I recommend this unit for a first time satellite user or as a replacement radio as it is for me. The only hassle was with Sirius itself-it took over 20 minutes on hold until someone picked up my call to transfer my subscription from my old unit to this new one, but that transfer only took about 10 seconds. I now have 10 of my favorite channels pre-set and the option to change them at any time. Good product overall!!!"
4,Sirius,Good purchase... Just wish I had a remote with it... Where can I get a remote for this model???
3,sirius,product was easy to install. wish the transmitter selections went a little lower sometimes have hard time finding a channel to use.
4,A Good Unit,"The Sirius Stratus is a good plug-and-play unit that is easy to install and sounds fine as well. Only a few minor drawbacks -- it doesn't come with a remote, which would be handy, especially in the car; it only features 10 presets (other units have 30); the traffic ""jump"" button is flaky; the FM tuner in the crowded LA market doesn't work so hot -- a direct line is much better.Those are relatively minor criticisms (unless you don't have a direct line into your radio and have to rely on the FM tuner) for an otherwise decent unit. If you're interested in Sirius and are looking at a ""starter"" tuner, the Stratus is worth looking at."
3,"Ok, didn't last too long","Car kit fine. Radio's transmitter died after 9.5 months; replacement was factory reconditoned and seems to produce more static. Like a previous review stated, unit can't transmit over partial FM signal and current radio gets over ridden by overhead power lines. Will have to find a way to directly connect to the radio"
1,Not something I would purchase again if I planed on using the FM transmitter,"Compared to older versions of Sirius receivers this is very poor. Even with the addition of the external transmitter antenna hooked up, this unit barely has enough power, ( even with the external antenna less than a foot from the car's FM antenna) for the car receiver to pick up the internally generated FM signal, Any competing FM signal regardless of how faint, compromises the signal from the internal FM Transmitter."
5,Nice,I bought this radio for my husband's truck. The sound is really nice. He enjoys the variety of stations. Arrived on time. What else do you want?
3,Just the Basics,"This is the basic receiver, it's usually about $30-$40. It has no bells and whistles, just what you need to get started. You can not rewind the music or set artist alerts like with the Sportster. If you can live without those features, you will enjoy this radio receiver. You do get the ability to store preset stations. But the biggie is the programming itself. You get everything from Martha Stewart, to Howard Stern. You even get stations like Playboy, BBC, CBC, French rock, even Radio Korea. There is something for everybody along with the typical rock to rap to dance.The box contains just the antennas for your car along with two different mounts, and a power supply cord. So you'll need to buy the home mounting kit if you want to bring it inside to hook up to your stereo.If you like to keep it simple, get this receiver."
1,Customer service is terrible!,"I've been a subscriber since 1/6/06 and the service has gotten worse and worse. All they are interested in is signing up new subscribers, but once you are in they dissapear. I had enough and tried to cancel. Got the run around as usual - I STILL HAVE THEIR GENERIC ELEVATOR MUSIC IN MY HEAD FROM THE TIME I SPENT ON HOLD! Finally had to write the following email to the customer feedback section of their website, since human beings don't appear willing to do anything but push you from one useless operator to the next:You kept me on hold for 45 minutes, made me talk to three different people, asked me 4 times why I wanted to cancel, then hung up on me and never called me back even though I had to give two different people my phone number and personal information. I demand that you cancel my account immediately, and DON'T YOU DARE ASK ME WHY I WANT TO CANCEL AGAIN AS IT SHOULD BE OBVIOUS BY NOW!Save yourself the hassel/headache/money."
4,Great entry level sirius radio,First off i want to review sirius because as a company they are great and have a great product. Their customer support is great and the radios are made well and if not they will replace your radio. This one is a entry level radio so it might wear out after a couple of years but for the price you can not complain
4,Very good,"I got this for a gift, and I think Sirius is superior to XM in many ways, notably in variety of focused stations."
1,Waste of money,"I hate to say this, but this little book isn't worth even the small price. It is just a list of names in alphabetical order, then a list of patron saints. You would do just as well to print any list off of the internet."
1,Bad Choice,"Everything that glitters is not gold!Similarly everything that has Nike written on it is not good!!I bought this item from Amazon for a friend in early 2004. That poor guy had used it for hardly few weeks when the display of it dimmed. So thinking that its a battery issue he replaced tha battery from an authorised shop. Then it worked for another few days, after which it died. It does not display anything at all, let alone keeping time!Since then we have been trying to get this thing repaired, but without any success!!Pure junk in the name of Nike!! Would not recommend any watch of Nike to anyone, you better get a Timex, it may not have ""just do it"" on it but it would at least keep the time!! :)"
4,Good Read!,"I have seen the movie, ""The Man Who Never Was"" and really enjoyed the way it was done. However, it was good to read an accounting of what actually happened, how and when, and how it was able to help the ""Allies"" during WWII."
3,The unknown hero who helped end a war.,"This is the story of a single man's death; and how it helpedchange the course of a war. His body was used, in a ratherunusual plan, to plant incorrect intelligence; causing theenemy to deploy incorrectly for an expected invasion.The man's identity remains secret at his family's request-an act that I, personally, consider a most noble act."
4,fascinating!,this is about a time just before a big allied strike when they were looking for ways to distract the axis. i found it very interesting and loved the parts about making the fake guy's cover story.
1,less than poor,"i bought this HID a while ago and it never came, seller never responded my emails....amazon had to refound my money"
1,Cheap Plastic,"Wow, where do I begin with this one? The thread is made of plastic and it broke off in my tripod mount! I was lucky that it was not screwed in tight and could coax it out with a tiny screwdriver. The light produced by the LED's is in the blue range, and blinding to anything looking in the cameras general direction. If that was not bad enough, the pictures come out overexposed and dead looking. Do not recommend!"
4,bluetooth,"Works well. had some problems setting it up..it wouldnt recognize it ..and it still doesnt ring in my ear..but oh well. works for the purpose i got it for..overall, i like it."
1,I wanted red!,"The company I got this from advertized red, without consulting they sent gray. They could be color blind, or just didn't care. It did work properly, but wasn't red. If you need a red one, go to where you can see it first."
2,"fuzzy, sporatic, uncomfortable...don't buy","I bought this Bluetooth, since my phone has a funky adapter for headsets, and it limits my choices. I have had nothing but troubles with this headset. First off, when I put it on my ear, it is not adjustable at all, therefore does not stay on the ear very easily (and definitely don't wear glasses with it). Second, when I use it the people on the other end told me they hear this high pitched noise that becomes annoying quite quickly. Third, the people on the other end also told me that I cut in and out constantly. These last two make for an impossible conversation. Definitely not worth the money.Also, it did not come in original Motorola packaging even though it was ""new"", yet you were not told this on the page about the product."
5,Best inexpensive turntable anywhere!,"I love this turntable! Sound quality is superb. Features are great. It has a start button so just put the album on and hit start and you're in bisiness! Of course, you can also manually put the needle on too. Just so you know, you will have to hook up the belt and set a equilization switch (depending on whether you have phono imput or not). Follow the directions closely and these two things will take only 10 minutes. I happen to have a phono input on my receiver, but for those who don't, that equilization switch could be a god-send. I like the fact that this turntable is super cheap yet still very good performance. Highly recommended!"
2,Not what I hoped for,"My old turntable conked out on me a few months ago after years of dutiful service, so a couple of montns ago I picked up this Sony turntable. Admittedly, the sound is pretty good, but it's cheap plastic construction, even for the price. It's not adjustable AT ALL. Also, the documentation that comes with it is a joke. I know other reviewers have had better experiences with this turntable than me, and this turntable may be what you need, but think hard about what your expectations are. It may be worth it to pay an extra hundred to get a manual turntable such as the Sony 350, instead."
2,Not bad for a reasonably priced DISPOSABLE product.,"Like most SONY products the PS-LX250H performs well. It is also very reasonably priced.However, like the oil in your car, turntable stylus replacement becomes necessary with time and use. Suddenly, the bargain quickly disappears. The stylus which is only available directly from SONY currently costs $55.52 plus shipping and handling. If SONY would dramatically lower the replacement stylus cost, this turntable would rate 5 stars for it's price to performance value.This model should serve well if only occaisonal, casual use is foreseen or if you don't mind paying $15,000 for an oil change."
5,Great Turntable,High quality turntable. Great for making digital (mp3) copies of your vinyl records.
2,Needs preamp with older receiver,"This turntable gave spotty service; older pop LPs were almost impossible to hear without additional amplification. About six months after purchase, the needle/tonarm started sliding across the record. It's no longer usable until we find a repair shop."
5,Blast from the Past,"I bought this Sony turntable on or about April 30, 2010 in order to play my Beatles records. In my opinions, vinyl is the only way to play the Beatles and this wonderful turntable allows me to do just that. It produces a rich, full stereo sound that blows CD players away. However, I must admit that I also have a good stereo amplifier. This Sony turntable is also priced right. It's very affordable. This product rocks!!! Tom"
4,the turntable that got me into vinyl!,"the sound is suprisngly good but i used the preamp on my reciever instead of the one built in.speed is abit off on this but not bad.you will instantly tell if you like the sound of vinyl more than cd. if you do, join the club!"
4,"Simple, Functional, Just Right.","This turntable, after hours and hours of play, has been just what I needed to enhance my love of music. The arm has an automatic return as well as a push-button up/down toggle, which makes for easy playback. The stylus is worthy, but an update to a higher quality stylus/cartridge wouldn't hurt. The only reason it did not get a 5-star review is for lack of outputs. It only has a fixed RCA out, which does not allow for a broad range of applications out of the box or user-specific cables, but a trip to any electronics store/website will get you a converter to go with almost any application. Otherwise, a great product!"
1,Sony Turntable,"The turntable was defective & didn't work. It wouldn't turn at all. I called the seller, J&R Music World. They said to call Sony. I called Sony & they finally agreed to replace it. I packed it up & sent it to Sony a couple of weeks ago & am still waiting for the replacement (or even to receive any acknowlegement from them)."
4,Very good basic turntable,"I have owned this turntable since 2009 and it is still working fine. It is an entry level unit, so not really for an audiophile. But if you are a music casual listener or closer to the audiophile level, this unit is a good choice. I love this turntable and the fact that it has a preamp (for those connecting to a receiver lacking the phono option). The sound --depending on your speakers -- generally comes out good. Im happy with it. Set up is not hard although, ironically, i spent 30 minutes trying to assemble it. I blame it on Sony technical writers. Other than that, good unit."
4,Just fine.,"Used pretty heavily over the past few weeks. No problems yet. I'm not a aficionado, though, so you may want to look for someone more experienced."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"I started having problems with this player within two months after purchasing. First, the turntable belt came off. After re-setting this, I have had the tone arm jump back and forth on occasion without ever playing the record. I finally got fed up today, and am ordering the Pioneer PL-990 and hoping that I have better luck."
4,First time Vinyl Record player owner and love it!,I have been very satisified with the quality of this product. I would recommend to any first time buyers.
4,Works very well.,I will be brief. It works fine the sound is good. It takes some time to unpack and set the belt to the disc but not a problem. Both ways either using the built in preanp or the phono in your own preamp work fine . It is a blessing for those that do not have a PHONO input on their preamp. The RCA hookup cable short you may need connectors to extend it. My only complain is that the tone arm cannot be locked on the rest position. In California we have earthquakes .....you know !
2,Don't like it,No amplifier so I couldn't event hear the music on the turntable. WOW! Now I'll have to spend more money for an amplifier
3,Great but not stackable :(,"After listening to 7 or 8 vinyls I fell back in love with my old albums - but then after laying down and having to get up every 4 tracks to flip the discs - I recalled a time when I could stack 4,5,6,7,8,9...albums and they would droI'd like to find a stackable unit even though they are ""inferior"". Otherwise this one is great for the money. No complaints on the needle cartridge quality or life span of the cartridge. No slipping on the rubber pad on the turntable. Easy to place the arm on the track you want and the suto functions work great. I wish they had added USB but for purists this rocks."
1,A Waste of Money,"Save your money. My best advice is to avoid this product. I plan to return it. You have to put the turntable together. Specifically, you have to put the platter on the turntable and then try to thread the belt around the driver. That's impossible once the platter is on the turntable. Neither is it possible to put the belt around the driver, then try to re-position the belt around the platter."
1,Sony PSLX250H Turntable,Simply did not work! I wasted my time assempling the darned thing only to find out that it does not work ...
3,What I wish I Had Known,"I bought this for my 15 year old grandson, who wants to listen to his Dad's ""old records""(that's what we called them!). Took it out of the box, set it up, and it wouldn't work. The $79. turntable required ""accessories"" and speakers and whatever else added up to an additional $200.+ ."
1,Is this the same thing that I tried 4 years ago???,I'm sorry that I cannot tell if this product isthe same as a Sony turntable of some 4 years ago.That machine had power supply hum and the thingtransmitted a terrible roar into the reproduction of sound.Sorry also that I bought it. Took it back.
2,Cheapest thing I have ever seen....,"I really didn't need a fancy turntable, but I at least wanted one that you could replace the cartridge with a decent one. There is no way to add your own cartridge or adjust the weight on the tone arm (the weight seemed too much to me - I prefer 1.5 grams or so. And you had to assemble the platter - and attach the tiny rubber band that drives the platter. Just looking at that little rubber band told me I needed a turntable that will last a few years. I guess I was expecting too much for an $80 turntable. I had to send it back and get that $200 audio technica direct-drive manual turntable. I don't really like manual turntables, but at least I can add my own needle and make minor adjustments."
5,transfer old lp`s & 45`s,"do you have a stack of old records with songs that you love & would like to store them on your computer, burn cd`s and convert to mp 3? would you like to do this for about 120 bucks? okay here we go. start with the sony ps-lx250h turntable [fully automatic with built in pre-amp. add the xitel import [includes all yor software todo the complete process. then get a set of sennheiser hd-201 earphones,& inline volume control. you`re all set. oh & all this can be found at AMAZON. ihave just completed 30 hrs. of recording with this combination without a glitch & with crystal clear sound. i am 75 yr`s old & got into computers one year ago & believe me i am no computer expert. i might qualify for entry level. what i am trying to say is this, the package is easy to use ,dependable, & gives excellent results."
2,Good until it breaks on you...,"I bought this turntable from Best Buy a few years ago and it did survive fine between all the moving I did in college, except it eventually half-broke, and ironically, it broke after sitting on a desk for months, not from a move. The motor goes at the wrong speed and sometimes the table needs help getting started. I don't know how common the breaking I experienced is, but if the electronics and mechanics are designed such that things like this happen, I doubt the quality of even a working model.Play it safe and buy a turntable with lots of reviews, and with no ""it just broke"" reviews like this one."
1,The unit dies after a few years.,"I bought this exact turntable twi years ago. I have used it in my man cave to listen to my 2,500-plus record albums. But over the course of time, the turntable developed a short someplace in the wiring inside the unit. It started with crackling noises, so I replaced the stylus. That didn't work. It got progressively worse to the point where the right channel basically does not work. This turntable is junk. Absolute Junk. What the heck happened to the once mighty Sony Corp.? Spend a few extra dollars on a better turntable so you don't have to spend money replacing this junk unit in two years."
3,sony turntable PSLX250H,"Good basic turntable. Can be started by push button, but I prefer manually placing the needle on the record. Very easy to hook up, like the dust cover better than the clear plastic on my old one."
3,Sony PSLX250H,"I am finding it difficult to provide a review, and only do so because of the name Sony. This unit require's an amplifier, and I am having trouble finding one. Amazon does not carry them, and, only after e-mailing them, did I get a list of phone nembers to call regarding an amp. Sell the project, not just the item. Still looking for an amp., so I can plat my 33's."
4,Turn Table,"Some assembly was required, but it was very easy. It was simple to connect to my existing stereo system and it works great."
5,It works and it works well.,"I had to replace an old turntable of the same make and model (my grandson's had experimented on it I think) and found this one for a good price. The original worked well and this one, after listening to Jon Anderson's 3 Ships, works well too."
4,Excellent,The turntable was in excellent shape and perform wonderfully. I like the design. It is the right size to fit the space in my stero stand.
2,Can't recommend,"I can't recommend this turntable. Its cheap junk. I've had it for a few years, but I've never used it much at all. Its spent 90% of that time in the box. In the last month I started listening to more vinyl though, buying a few jazz LPs off ebay. Now when I move the needle to the playing position it wants to retract and stop. I can get it to work, but then it will start doing it again. I opened it up to try to figure out what was going on with it. I can see what's causing the behavior but I don't really know what happened to make it do what its doing. Its like there is something missing. I got annoyed looking at the stupid, cheap design of the thing and just resolved to buy a new one (not Sony) with direct drive that will hopefully last."
5,Perfect for my needs,"Great product.Easy to put together, works perfectly with my twenty year old system.And I love the controls.My old vinyl sounds so good. Many memories come floodng back as I listen to songs I haven't heard in years.And who can complain about the price. A real bargain."
5,Easy to use.,"Easy to install, just plug it in. It works well and simple to use-not a lot of bells and whistles. I just wanted to play my old albums."
2,Decent turntable that actually isn't a good value.....,"This turntable is offered as a low end offering from Sony and, for what it is, it's okay. It will play most records adequately and is sufficient for infrequent to moderate duty.However, the PS-LX250H ends up not being as good of a buy as many would think since this model is merely a rebadged Audio-Technica AT-PL50.You may be able to save a little more money and just purchase the Audio-Technica version over the Sony PS-LX250H (or the Teac P-988 for that matter since it's also the same turntable with different branding).That said, you can also obtain replacement styli for your Sony PS-LX250H and Teac P-988 by buying the replacement stylus for the Audio-Technica AT-PL50 from, well, any place that sells Audio-Technica. The replacement stylus is the ATN3600L, which is a low-cost (around $10 U.S.) conical diamond stylus."
2,thumbs down,"2 issues:1 - New turntable sounded and worked just fine. About 30 days later, there was an audible RPM control problem. The turntable is belt-driven by a small, slip-prone, spindle with no feed-back to control the RPM. I returned the turntable and got a replacement. Second table worked just fine for about 20 records or so. Then, the RPM control problem came up again!2 - No tonearm counter-weight control. This is a crime. Records that play just fine on other players skip like mad on this one. Unless you have records in near-perfect condition, keep in mind that this player offers no tonearm weight control!Got my money back. Sony dropped the ball on this one."
3,"Maybe, maybe not","This inexpensive Sony turntable sounds good, but I returned mine after three weeks. Why? The speed was a problem.The first three times I used it, the Sony sounded fine, except in certain passages it sounded a little flat, as though the speed was slightly off.The next three times speed became a real problem. It might play one side fine, then be way too slow on the next, going maybe 30 rpm.You can't adjust speed on this turntable. It's easy to use; it looks nice; the preamp makes it possible to put it directly into the computer. But if the speed isn't just right, you have no options.It allowed me to see that converting LPs to digital computer files is not that difficult, and they sound as good as the record. I think I'm going to have to spend $50 more and try the Denon DP 29F."
3,"Good player, but rubber band belt is questionable","The turntable plays as it is suppose to play. I'm not an audiophile, but I do have alot old vinyls from the 1970's and early 80's and they played well on this turntable, at least the ones that were not too scratched. Only paid $79.95 so it was a good deal. The platter is 100% aluminum which for some unknown reason influenced my decision to buy this item. The only thing that concerns me is the drive belt, basically it is a thin rubber band. This raises some questionable quality and longevity issues down the road, but other than that it was a good purchase."
2,Works well for a while,"I've had this turntable for about 2 1/2 years now, and it worked well for most of that time. In the past few months, the speed became unstable (an extremely disorienting thing to listen to) and it recently bit the dust completely. The turntable has a number of things in its favor, especially the built-in preamp (can be switched on or off) to work with new amplifiers without phono inputs. The sound is good and the price is right, but it's not a model of reliability."
3,Hinge Broke,I closed the lid on my Sony Turntable and I heard this terrible snap. The hinge jammed and broke. Appears to be a design flaw. Otherwise performs well.
1,Could not assemble it,I opened the box and began to read the directions. They were no help at all. I continued to try but I could not get the belt assembled and therefore was unable to try it out. I never learned whether it worked well or not. I got so frustrated that I boxed it back up and called for authorization to return it. The directions should have been more specific and/or the turntable should have been shipped ready to use.
2,Not What It's Cracked up to be,"I received the package and was very excited to play my first record in a long time. However; it wouldn't work, the turntable wasn't turning. Upon further inspection I realized the belt had come off. Not sure how or why, but upon reattachment, I dropped the needle and was less than thrilled at the quality. It's as if all music is slowed down. There are no speed control functions other than the record size 33 or 45 rpm, so I'm less than thrilled with a lackluster piece of audio equipment. I'm going to inquire into returning it next."
5,Nice Addition!,I'm glad I bought this turntable for my stereo. I'm replacing my 1980 Technics turntable with cracked cover and rotted belt. I want a way to make tapes from my albums so I can play them in my truck. It sounds great and looks good too! What more could you ask for?
4,Good turntable for the price,"I purchased this turntable to replace a failed turntable in my father's sound system. He still has a lot of vinyl that he likes to play from time to time. This turntable is a good buy. It has a built-in preamp that is pre-set for connecting to AUX jacks. It also has a switch to reset if connecting to PHONO jacks. This is not a unit for a hardcore audiophile by any means, but for a budget shelf system and an average music listener this will fit the bill nicely. After years this is still working fine in my father's system."
5,Just like my turntable.... bought one for my friend,"This turntable is awesome. I have one and decided to purchase one for my friend for his birthday. I looked all over for it and found it here on Amazon. My friend was wanting one like mine, so he was super stoked when he unwrapped this bad boy. It plays great. Now to take him vinyl shopping...."
2,"I wanted it to be a keeper, but...","it just wouldn't fit the bill. I purchased this turntable at a retailer and had problems with the manual belt slipping off, as well as errors in speed of play (as already noted by other users, and the factory-set speed control was slightly too fast as well.) After about two weeks, I exchanged it - the second model I received seemed to have the correct pitch, but the hinges on the dust cover were busted out of the box (minor inconvenience) and the player skipped on 4 out of 5 records I would play (obviously, a major inconvenience) - even brand new ones.The player looks great, and the lower price is tempting, but don't buy it - I have spent more time trying to get the thing to work than I have actually enjoying vinyl records."
1,A Real Disappointment,"I purchased this turntable with the intent on listening to my beloved Lp's and burning them straight to CD's. After playing the first LP it began to drag, usually halfway through the first song on the albums. I went online and re-read the manual to see if I could make any adjustments but found nothing. So I just went back to my Marantz turntable that I bought back in 1980 and which plays fine. It has sat for two years without being played and based on some of these reviews it can be connected to the computer so I may break it out again and see if I can find some software to adjust the pitch and/or speed and just convert it to mp3's and then to CD. The Marantz is being used to convert directly to CD now. The only reason I bought it was that I assumed that any turntable built in this decade would work better than one built in the 80's but boy was I wrong."
2,Dont do it!,This table is as simple and basic as they get. If you are really getting into vinyl I would look for some entry-level at about $300+ like Rega 1
2,You get what you paid for!,"I was a little disappointed with this item. I was expecting the item being more sturdy, it seems to me that the turntable is not going to last long. It is not a good buy."
5,I can finally listen to my LP's!!!!!!!!,"For a very long time I had a couple of vinyl's with no way to listen to them. I'm the type of guys that likes new stuff but not the fanciest new stuff. I basically wanted a turntable that could just play my records and I didn't need to transfer them into MP3's or anything. This turntable is perfect for a person who just wants to listen to there LP's with non of the extra features. Its's totally easy to setup but just looks complicated at first. Overall, I am very satisfied with this turntable."
4,Great sound reproduction at a bargain price,"This sony turntable gives execelent sound reproduction for an inexpensive unit, it is so simple to operate, a child can do it once you get past the initial basic assembly. I have read some of the reviews here and can't help but laugh, people seem to forget that they are buying 'Home Audio' equipment not superior professional stuff and while it is fair to expect good quality for your money one should not expect to get maximum benefit from minimum investment, you can't expect your grandma's minivan to perform like a 'Hot Rod', with that being said I highly recommend this turntable to anyone who is looking once again to bring back that feeling of nostalgia that vinyl gives without spending a bundle! As far as durability goes only time will tell. Good luck with your sony products."
1,I'm not impressed,"I bought this item as a Christmas gift for my husband. We assembled it and had the same experience that others have posted--when playing the record it would sound fine at first and then start to drag and vary in speed. Apparently Sony has made a model where many of us are having problems with the belt drive system. I felt so bad that I even purchased this refurbished as a gift, but what can I tell you, I've always trusted the Sony name and thought that this would be the same quality as I've had from the Sony name in the past. I don't know if these were thoroughly tested enough before being certified as refurbished or what--but seriously don't waste the money and time. Just spend a little extra and buy a new turntable. I'm wishing that I would have."
2,Plays too fast/ too high of a pitch.,"Pitch is too high, and you cannot adjust it. Either that or the turntable spins too fast. I should have just went ahead and bought more than a basic model turntable."
1,Can't believe its a Sony,Got this for Christmas last year. I played two records on it and then the belt drive system began to drag. It could not maintain a constant speed on either the 33 rpm or 78 rpm settings. This turntable is a peice of crap. It would be better to spend a little more and get something that will last more than a day.
2,Scraping Bottom,"While this turntable will play your records, the audio quality leaves a lot to be desired. To me it sounded like it was being played underwater and this was through my venerable stereo system that sounded great with my old turntable (which finally ground to a halt). Granted, this is about the most inexpensive turntable available and you get what you pay for.Also, if you are looking for the option of switching in a better cartridge, this is not the turntable for you. It was difficult to determine that from the sketchy information available for this product. If you are shopping for an inexpensive turntable, you are better off to pay a little more and get the Technics (Panasonic) SL-BD20D which does have a P-mount on the tone arm, and though I admit I haven't actually auditioned that product, must sound better than this ""bag over the head"" piece of plastic."
1,"Junk, do not bother","So yourself a favour and spend more. After using an ancient Dual turntable I inherited from my uncle I decided to replace it rather than repair it when it suddenly stopped working. I bought this Sony because I thought it would have to be better, being brand new. It's not. It's the worse turntable I have ever used. Old vinyl which never, ever skipped on my Dual skips on this pile of junk. New vinyl, which I buy still wrapped in cellophane skips also. Sure, some stuff plays, and the sound is decent, but that's not the point. I hate sitting there wondering if the next track will skip and I find myself sighing in relief if it doesn't."
5,Cant go wrong with Sony...,My Father-in-Law is very happy to be able to play his Perry Como Albums! He initially wanted to have his stereo repaired and we found it more cost effective to just replace. You cant go wrong with Sony products.
1,100% Pure Apocalyptic Drivel,"This book is a sure-fire prescription for scaring the daylights out of young kids (I know, I was one of them). Mr. Lindsey's theories have proven to be nonsense (the world was supposed to have ended by now), but you'll never hear Mr. Lindsey admitting he was wrong. He just keeps re-writing the book to eliminate all embarrassments. Just for fun, try comparing the original book to the latest revison. Better yet, read ""End-Time Visons: The Road to Armageddon?"" by Richard Abanes and understand how ""prophets"" like Hal Lindsey have been peddling their apocalyptic nonsense for the last two thousand years. Or, if you want, go ahead and read ""The Late Great Planet Earth""--just don't read it to your kids and scare the crap out of them for no good reason."
1,Save your money,"Misinterpretation of Revelation run amuck! Try reading The Lamb's Supper by Scott Hahn or something, anything that predates the dispensationalist premillenium assumptions of evangelicals since Darby and Scofield et al."
1,Pure Bunk,"I read this book in 1971. It was pure bunk back then and it's even purer bunk 35 years after its publication. All of its ""predictions"" didn't happen. Yet the author continues to be admired in fundamentalist circles. What does that tell you?I see it's available for $0.01. That would be a waste of a good penny."
5,A great stater in end times prophecy,"I found this book to be an excilent start for me into the end times and Biblical prophecy. I believe that Hal has recieved a lot of flac for inacurate perdictions. He is not a prophet! He is only making educated guesses about the end times. I found his ideas to be very insightful. Because of his book, my christian life has been strenghthend and have myself researched Biblical prophecy and end times scriptures since I read the book. This was formerly a topic that I knew nothing about, and now have become pretty knowlegable.I strongly recomend this book to any Christian who is interested in knowing more about the end times. The only down side to his book that I found is that in time it had become dated and some of the current events that he speaks about are alomost forgotten. I think some of his more recent books on the same subjects would be a good compliment to this one.God Bless You! ""With God all things are possible"" - Matt. 19:26"
4,Passed the test of time,"It's been several years since this book piqued my curiosity. It contains the author's interpretation of biblical prophecy. Having recently given it a re-read and finding it's presentations still strong and compelling, I have to say read it. It has relevant information that is definitely thought provoking."
1,Do yourself a favor and dig deeper.,"Since the book wasn't written for entertainment value, I can't give it any stars for that. All I had to do to remember why the Late Great Planet Earth amounts to shallow speculation was watch the movie The Omega Code, for which Hal Lindsey was the ""prophetic advisor."" When you see his views actually acted out, you realize what a pathetically trite and disjointed ending he has concocted for the world. It made me think, ""If this is how Hal really thinks the world is going to end, he ought to be embarrassed."" Of course, The Late Great Planet Earth is where the Lindsey empire began. Someday I'll sit down and reread it for entertainment value."
2,Horrible Scholarship but entertaining,"This is a difficult book to rate. In terms of its scholarship and line of reasoning it gets 0-1 stars. In terms of its entertainment value it gets 3-4 stars. The first time I read this book was about 17 years ago. Lindsey follows in the dispensationalist tradition of C.I. Scofield, a tradition of exegesis that fundamentally misreads and distorts the Biblical text. Lindsey's subjective isegesis and his arbitrary linking of texts together demonstrates the intellectual bankruptcy of apocalypticism and dispensationalist theology.On the other hand, when considered as Science Fiction, this work can be quite amusing. I recommend reading it only if you have nothing better to do and want to get a good laugh."
5,The Late Great Planet Earth,"A very interesting interpretation of the many prophecy's contained in the Bible regarding ""The Second Coming"", the ""Rapture"", and the ""Apocolypse"". A must read for any Christian, and anyone that is curious about the ""End of Days"". A short book that is brief, but makes it's points. Key prophecies before the second coming are the return of the Jews to their country (ocurred in 1948 in Israel), and the rebuilding of the Jewish Temple on the original site (now occupied by the Dome of the Rock). A difficult book to put down until it is finished."
1,I Can't Believe anyone takes this seriously,"This book probably represents the darkest manifestation of the scams and snake oil American dream. Despite the fact that this book originally predicted the end of the world (by biblical apocalypse, not Reagan's) to occur in the early 1980's and has been pushed back every time his ""expert"" interpretation of prophesy failed to come true (the latest occuring in 2000), millions still buy this book and, no doubt, work themselves up into a religious frenzy of renewed fear and loathing. While this book once scared me when I was 12, all i can do now is laugh at the stupidty of it. Trite, simplistic, ridiculous, and insane are just some of the words that could be used to describe this book. If you want to contribute more to Lindsey's favorite charity (himself), then by all means go ahead and flush your money straight down the toilet. That way you can cut out the middle man and place your order with Lindsey directly."
4,He who wins souls is wise,"In the 70's, 80's and 90's in Melbourne Australia God used this book as a mighty tool for evengelism. Many, many people were led to a saving faith in Christ after either reading this book or seeing the movie. Melbourne is rife with testimony of how God used this book to awaken many a soul. I am not saying that the ends justifies the means in relation to theological error; However it did awaken people to spiritual realities and the possibility that there might even BE a God out there who would one day return and judge the Earth. Often people who had no such a concept. I beleive that even the most learned among us will get a 5 out of 8 for theology. Jesus said you will know them by thier fruits, I have only seen good fruits come from this book, and, ""He who wins souls is wise"". Thank you for your work Hal."
5,Late Great Planet Earth,"Perfect transaction. The book is in good shape, and it arrived in a timely manner. The person for whom I ordered it is happy."
1,Please spare us!,"Twenty five some years latter, and people actually still take Hal Lindsy serious? Incredible.... Do yourself a favor... Take the money you were going to use to buy this book, and use it to feed starving third world children. Then read your Bible, without the Schofield notes, and let It speak for Itself. Yes I did read this book, and it was a waste of my time..."
1,Illegitimate Interpretation,"A bestseller in the '70s, this is biblical interpretation at its worst. For an antidote, read ""End-Times"" by James M. Efird."
1,Ooops!,"This book practically replaced the Bible in the fundamentalist church I attended in the 70's and had the whole congregation running scared.What silly nonsense it turns out to be. Completely wrong in every interpretation as the clear evidence of history has proven. The lesson of this book now is to beware of false prophets, but keep your faith in God."
1,One Star - But Only Because Negative Numbers aren't a Choice,"I read this book when I was a kid (I'm 45 now). It scared the bejeebers out of me which I now realize was the whole point. (Fear is a POWERFUL way to manipulate people - ESPECIALLY CHILDREN!) Because there was no one around I could turn to who would explain to me about sensationalism and greed, I swallowed it hook, line, and sinker. I put off planning college and a career for a number of years because I couldn't see the point - after all, who wastes their time rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic? When I think of the years I wasted because of this book, I get really, really angry! This book was NOT an isolated incident - the religious perspective it grows out of systematically reinforces the same ideas.I now have children of my own, and I have quite bluntly told them my story to protect them from such mercenary exploitation.What else can I say but that I hope this man is enjoying his money!"
4,The Late Great Planet Earth,Had been looking for this book for some time. Glad I finally found it on this site. Great condition and fast delivery.
4,"Wrong on the timeline, right on the politics","While this book may have predicted events which did not come to pass in the time frame proposed by the author, a re-reading of this book in light of recent political and social developments in China and the Soviet Union, gives a chilling perspective to watching current events play out on the world stage. Communists whose plan Lindsey allegedly exposed in this book, will most likely be scrambling to discredit the predictions therein, insult the religious fundamentalists who might use the book for perspective, and cover up the true nature of developments on the world political and social stage, and this comes from a bisexual man who has no use for such fundamentalists who condemn gays and bisexuals, but who can see and hear a big truck coming down the road when he's about to get run over."
3,He Called It,Be the book junk or not is a matter of opinion. But Hal got one thing correct- In 1970 he predicted that the Final battle would be between US and Russia Allied vs China and the Middle East. No one in 1970 thought it possible that the US and Russia would be allies- this was at the height of the cold war. Here we are in 2001 with China selling arms to Syria and Iran. Maybe Hal got lucky on this one.
1,What a Load of Baloney,"This book depends upon (count'em) five works from the nineteenth century, all of which have been debunked by scholars. It is a wonderful fantasy. If you like reading fantasy, and can accept it as such, it will be a great book for one to read.However, ask yourself what has happened to Hal Lindsey in the last 36 years: he made a fortune, now owns several homes and luxury cars. Strange way, don't you think, for one to show his belief that the end is near?"
3,"Thought provoking, intellectually challenging!","I too read this book when I was quite young back in the 80's. Although some of the author's ""interpretations"" of prophecy didn't or doesn't appear to be coming to pass, I was never under the assumption that Mr. Lindsay was, himself, a prophet. This book is merely a collection of one man's ideas and what he believes is going to happen. Maybe some of his ""ideas"" have been off (I personally don't believe in a secret rapture) but consider this: In his book, ""Blood Moon"" he correctly predicted that a non-Italian pope would succeed John Paul II and that his reign would be short (Pope Benedict is 78), back in 1996. The next pope (after Benedict) in his story became the anti-christ. We shall see!People need to take/read this book in its proper perspective. It's not the Bible; but it is, in the least, challenging, thought provoking and one man's opinion of how this world, as we known it, will end."
5,Kitten nirvana,"The first 30 seconds, they were a bit afraid of the rattling noise...but now, even my tiny kittens are attacking this like prey (curling up around it, batting it with front and back feet, chasing it around both the hardwood and carpeted floors, and even picking it up and throwing it). They love this thing. I guess all babies like rattles."
2,Images Are Skewed,The images are beautiful but purposely skewed. I have to do alot of creative work in photoshop to use them.
4,Different but still worth the wait,"Anyone who expects a band to sound the same after almost 20 years is crazy. Ronnie and the band have changed with time and while this album does not rock as hard as 1,2 and 3 it still has some great playing and vocals. LAST MAN ON EARTH is a great track. Denny Davey and Glenn sound great. Ronnie is always good. The album has a more blues feeling than the old hard rock sound. I don't agree with the other review on this site that said it was a waste of money. Some people want every thing to stay the same. I say support the artist is you like them and by doing that you try the album and see if you like it."
4,"Interesting study of the ""other"" Japan","This book is a well written, although sometimes meandering, account of the author's interviews with people in Japan who prove that Japan is not as homogenous as we might think. The only problem with the book is that it at times strays from the interviews into philosophical musings that are tedious. but the book as a whole is worth while and a must for anyone studying Japan."
3,Connecticut Valley Furniture,"Beautifully illustrated and composed. A must for the dealer/collector turned on to rare and expensive early American furniture with a regional flavor. Handicapped in a traditional way unlikely to be noticed: unchallenging scholarship that barely passes muster, to bring respectability to a costly, whimsical business."
3,"Good, not great","Good mod for a spare ""fill"" light to get a just a little more light. Trade off brightness and focus capability for distinctly better battery life and near indestructibility. Have had mine for over a year w/o any trouble. As the availability of 1 watt Luxeon equipped lights have increased in quantity and dropped significantly in cost, this swap is only for those who feel it a shame to waste their old light. Perfect for kids. Works fine w/ rechargeable batteries."
4,LED upgrade Kit,"Fairly easy to install and a good improvement in brightness. Less heat and less power consumption has improved battery life as well. Still a bit expensive, but it works well."
3,"Sounded like a good idea, but I'm not that impressed","We have several mag lights around the house and in our cars. We like that they're inexpensive and durable, but we get tired of replacing batteries. So when I heard about this LED replacement bulb kit I thought it would be a good way to extend the battery life. We're fans of LED with our tactical flashlights, so I was sold on the idea.In reality, the LED bulb isn't brighter than the original mag light bulb, and the beam is a wide swath of light. You can't narrow down the beam to pinpoint it like you can with the original bulb. I won't upgrade any of our other mag lights after trying this one. And I'll probably keep this one in my car, where I can use it to read maps or look for something dropped on the floor.It's not horrible, it's just not better than the original mag light bulb."
3,Satisfactory,"The lack of focusing for the light beam is a negative, but it is bright and the (presumably) extended life will be advantageous."
1,Exesively priced,"this product is nice but exesively priced. Isn't better to buy a maglite with led for about $18 something with free shipping, that only this upgrade.For almost the same price you can get the flashlight"
5,Reader-friendly Scholarship,"'In the Heart of the Desert' is a very thoroughly researched book on the writings of the Desert Fathers and Mothers of Christian tradition going back to the time of St. Antony.What makes it really special is how well it is written for lay-reader or scholar alike. This is a book that you will enjoy whether you know a little or a lot about the subject, and it is easy to understand, follow and benefit from irregardless of your prior knowledge of the subject.Chryssavgis captures the peace of the desert fathers and makes it accessible to those of us living in the modern day world, who would like to bring a bit of the 'desert' tradition into our every day lives.Thank you, Father Chryssavgis, this book has been a wonderful read, and an inspiring journey into the desert."
4,In the Heart of the Desert: The Spiritualilty of the Desert Fathers and Mothers,In The Heart of The Desert:Was helpful in my studies of the ancient Mothers and Fathers of the Dessert.They followed a more strict way of purification with truth within themselves.
4,Inspiration and Information,"Having recently discovered the work of John Chryssavgis, I am appreciative of the readability of his books. While the content reveals much about the ancient abbas and ammas, it does so in a way that lets the reader easily relate to one's own spiritual experience. Several colorful and lovely icons are included in the book.This is worth adding to one's library of spiritual books."
2,Coasters!,"Whenever I try to burn audio to these disks, out of a pack of 50, about half turned out to be colorful coasters. Out of the other half that did burn, some tracks didn't play.Although they are very pretty colors, go with TDK."
2,Don't Bother Reading this book!,"When Charlotte goes on a trip to visit her friend Oliver in London shes finds a big surprise waiting for her. It seems that Oliver's mom and step-dad had to go to Germany on important business. Oliver neglects to call Charlotte and tell her that she will have to exchange her ticket, in hopes that while his parents are gone he and Charlotte can go to scottland to see a sick old friend. It sounds exciting and you have to give Ms. Bond credit for her delightful imagery, and painting a creative picture of London and Scotland, however the book lacks a good ending. It feels as though the author got to page 296 and said, ""well that's it I'm spent!"" Through out the entire book you wonder what Oliver's feelings for Charlotte are exactly and nothing actually develops. At the end it just feels opened ended. Not a story where you can just make up the ending but like the author tried but just couldn't finish it. So Warning to the wise just don't waste your time."
4,Okay Book,"This book is about a 16 year old girl named Charolette. She moves to London. This 18 year old boy, Oliver Shattuck picks her up from the airport. They begin to become very close friends. Oliver is living with his great-uncle, Commodore Shattuck. Then his great-uncle dies and Oliver must go to live with his mom. He postpones the trip... See what then happends when you read this book.This book was alright. It was okay, nothing special. It was kind of boring at times. It is a little long and confusing. Read this book to find out what you think of it."
5,Nancy does it again!,"The Love of Friends is the third book in the 'Charlotte and Oliver' Series, as I call it. This one is undoubtably one of the best. I have read every single book by Nancy Bond, and this is one my top three list. Charlotte goes to visit her friend, Oliver, who has moved to England. She soon learns that Oliver has kept something from her-that Paula,Oliver's mother, had told him to tell her to postpone her visit for a week because of a business trip. He did not. Consequentely, Oliver and Charlotte are alone in Oliver's family's London flat, and Oliver has told Charlotte that he wants to go to Scotland and that he wants her to go with him. A poinient and wonderful tale that touched my heart. A definite MUST READ!"
4,Love book!,"I like this book because it is great for kinder gardeners, to refresh what was cover in school in a fun way."
3,excellent book,This is a good book. I got it for my 4 year old and it was a little hard so i went with a pre k book....but other then that I would recommend it. I guess my daughter just wasnt ready for kindergarden work.
4,Great for Review,"Although I would not recommend this book for Home-schoolers to use as their primary curriculum, this book is great for extra practice or to use as a review. For the Price, this book is a combination of workbooks put together adding a little flavor of history and science"
3,Not enough math..,"This book offers great practices for reading, writing and thinking skills. However, there is very little math (no addition or subtraction exercises at all). My son is only 4-1/2 years old and he flew through this workbook. We both thought the book could offer harder exercises, especially it is supposed to be a grade-K level workbook."
1,Poor Hose,"I bought 2 of these hoses, just this spring (2011). One has a crack and is leaking; the female end on the other broke loose. Poor quality. The hoses are very convenient to use, but need to be made better."
1,Very Poor Quality,"I have had this item for less than 60 days and the hose has a very large gash. This is not fixable or usable at this point. I realize the ones that I have purcased for far less at Target only a last a season or two, but at least I can return if it breaks within the first season of use. I am out $40 bucks and very displeased."
3,disappointed,"Fittings are silver colored metal, not brass. The collars at each end help protect the hose from kinking but they tend to slide out of place.My disappointment in this product is partly my fault - coiled hoses of any manufacturer can't be stretched to their full length, and the inside diameter can restrict water flow, so I went for the 1/2 inch hose 50-ft long to be sure it would meet our needs. This turned out to be longer than we really needed (although 25' would probably have been too short), and with a 1/2 inch diameter the long hose becomes a little heavy and unwieldy when pressurized - and my wife is the primary user of this hose.But it works and can be successfully stuffed with two hands into the cabinet storage area without kinking, it just isn't as convenient and easy as I wanted."
2,Loved the 25 ft,"I bought the 25ft last year and loved it, so I bought a 50ft for the front. The swivel base leaks and I cannot seem to make it stop. The 25ft did that for a while but I was able to stop it by moving the hose, but that does not work with the 50ft. The fitting looks flimsier than the hose I bought last year."
1,Short life span!!!,"Bought this last year and was very happy until I had to throw it out because it developed pin hole size leaks...that should only happen after years and years of use, not 6-8 months"
2,DONT LET THE PICTURE FOOL YA!,"No tackle box guide, no knot tying card. Only 4 small lures, which are worth $20, BUT IF YOU ARE BUYING IT FOR THE PACKAGE, NOT WORTH IT. I bought it for the tackle box guide, since shipping was gonna make the guide @$14 total, figured why not spend an extra $10 and get 4 lures and a knot card. Fooled me with the pic. and description."
3,Hmm,"Well, as for the album, it was really good. Definately erotic...very sexy. What drew me to the album was Fantastic Plastic Machine's track... till this day, I wonder if the title came about from the graffiti on the wall in Alex DeLarge's municipal flatblock, 18A, Linear North housing complex in ""A Clockwork Orange""..... very interesting."
5,Great spoon rest.,This is a very nice spoon rest. I bought it along with the matching trivet. They are both high quality and very cute.
5,Inspiring and Totally Amazing...A Must Have!,"""River of Time"" is by far the best, but most underrated and overlooked album that the dynamic duo(The Judds) ever created. This was the last album produced before Naomi's illness was discovered, therefore it captures the girls at their finest hour... Unlike their ultimate masterpiece ""Love Can Build A Bridge"" that echoes the death of their long and successful career. Artisticly speaking, this is the most complete Judd record. It features Wynonna's amazing voice matured and at it's best. This record also includes several Naomi penned tunes that give the album its life, namely the title track ""River of Time"". This CD is worth purchasing for that song alone. It is the most powerful and inspiring song that I've ever heard. The dynamics of this track top even those of The Judds' signature song ""Love Can Build A Bridge"". You have not lived until you have experienced the ""River Of Time""!"
2,could be better,"I have heard this CD from a friend of mine, and had to switch off the music and turned to another cd, will not recomend this cd, at least it could have some more hits on it."
2,Boring,This movie was not funny. I loved the cast and it sucked to see them all in a bad movie. The whole storyline was just very predictable. Really a waste.
2,The writers should be run out of Hollywood,"This movie was a complete and total disappointment. Every aspect of the story was inane from Ryden's job search to her love life to her family's ""adventures"". Not only were there more groans than laughs, but the movie was pretty insulting to the audience. The characters' actions were not remotely realistic and if they were, they'd be pathetic, not loveable.I feel bad for all of the actors (particularly Bledel) who signed on to this disaster. They would have been better off reading from the phone book. Whoever was responsible for this script should be run out of Hollywood. They obviously don't belong."
3,3.5 stars. Exceeded my expectations,"I didn't have high hopes for this movie but I was bored one night and decided to check it out. It actually turned out quite enjoyable. Although a bit cheesy, it had a pretty cute story and several parts I laughed out loud at the humor. ""What'd I tell you about licking people's heads"" ""To not to"" I'm sure it wouldn't be everyones cup a tea but I, as well as other people, found it quite entertaining. The supporting cast (her family) were crazy, funny and lovable. The only negative thing I have to say is everyone else in the movie was a better actor than Alexis Bledel. She's a cute girl but has no dimension outside of her character off gilmore girls. But still the same, I enjoyed it!"
4,Cute movie,This movie is a lot better than I thought it would be. As for someone is graduating college in May this movie is perfect for any student who is not sure what is going to happen. It is a cute feel good movie. As for feminism (which I am a feminist) I don't think it strikes a nerve. It a light-hearted movie should not be taken to the point of reality. As movies are a escape of the real world.
4,entertaining,"It was a cute, no thought movie. I liked it, and would buy it cheap. Some people take movies like this too seriously because of the ""feminist"" aspect of it....don't listen. Its an entertaining, simple movie."
1,LOL,"my friend and i went to see this and we were the only ones in the theater. thank goodness we were because we laughed throughout the whole thing. not because it was a comedy, but because it was so damn bad. honestly, this is the worst movie i have ever seen...lol."
2,Had high hopes but just... eh,"I had high hopes for this movie because the previews looked good... but it was just eh. It was very predictable and the acting just seemed strained the whole time. The comedy wasn't even very funny, it seemed forced. I would recommend watching this for free or cheap from somewhere, and not wasting your money on buying the movie."
3,Post Grad,"Was very very cute, But not quite as good as I was expecting, Not her best movie, but good for background!"
3,Alright,"Not as bad as I thought it would be. It was predictable, cliche, but not boring. Just a simple, cute story. The ending was unrealistic. The best part of the movie was watching Alex Bledel - she plays her character of the post-grad well. The movie wasn't funny though, despite all the attempts at humor. This is a take it or leave it sort of film."
4,Nice movie!,"Post Grad is actually a rare film that attempts to highlight the struggles of a recent college graduate in the current economic downturn. Although the movie is highly predictable and does not offer any shock value, it is high on entertainment. Alexis Bledel is ideal for the role and did a fantastic job while the rest of the supporting cast was alright. Overall, Post Grad is an entertaining movie to watch at least once but beyond that, it is certainly not the type that deserves a spot in your collection."
2,Post Grad? More like .. Post-Bad,Really bad. Stupid. Not funny. Held on to watch @ 40 minutes but just coul;d not bear any more. Really sad because this movie had a decent cast.Who's dog did Michael Keaton run over to be consigned to this?Carol Burnett? Please!
3,Feels flat...,"This review also goes with the MacGregor ASA 12"" softball. They are OK. When you hit them hard, they sound flat and don't fly far."
5,The perfect match,"These two childhood friends from State Street in Mason City, IA grew up across the street from each other. Now twenty five years later they are the perfect match in the beautiful album. The CD solution for a soothing drive home."
5,Enjoy fishing for this one!,This is a lovely well-done excellent recording that you will really enjoy...Mark Fisher and Mark Lawson are both professional and polished performers!
3,Honda VTX,"I like the colors of this, but I am not thrilled with the fit. I have a big head 7 1/2 and it doesn't fit as well as another do rag I bought on Amazon. Material is not as heavy also. I wish the elastic band was sewn completely in the material and not hanging out in the back. I think there are better do rags available for less money. In terms of the pattern (flames) I liked it a lot."
3,Gave away,"Has a piece of stretch material if the front headband to allow fit for multiple sizes. Im not really into that. Doesn't wick away sweat in that part. Would rather have regular material, tie it in the back and it would be a smaller circumference too boot (getting into the helmet). gave it away..."
1,Don't waste your money,"Poor quality and a bad fit. The picture does not represent the product well at all. It has a ""sweat band"" type material inside that I was unaware of and find uncomfortable. I would suggest shopping for one in person."
5,The World They Made Together,"Sobel uses the concept of ""world views"" to support her argument that although the English and the different cultures in West Africa had separate world views, the close interaction between 18th-century Virginian whites and blacks resulted in these separate world views deeply influencing each other. In the 18th century, black and white children played together, white children often had a black woman as a ""surrogate mother"", and blacks and whites often worshipped together. This close interaction reinforced perceptions, values, and identities (world views) that were common between the two world view systems and, with time, the differences between the world views resulted in each world view being influenced by the other until they developed a symbiotic relationship."
3,Nice idea!,"I loved the idea of an ""old time"" way to drink port. These are VERY delicate. There IS a difference in how the port tastes because it is consumed from the bottom (less oxidation) and the ""straw"" causes the port to flow across the tongue for a delightful sip. There is a BIG issue though ... they are not stable at all. The legs are too small, short and too closely placed - these tip over with little assistance! Good port is a terrible thing to waste! Nifty novelty that people notice in the cabinet though and everyone asks to try them."
4,"Cute, but Small","these glasses hold about as much as a shot glass. I expected them to be bigger, but they are still cute and serve their purpose."
5,very cute,"it is smaller than normal wine cup, but it is very very cute. It makes wine tasting more fun. Instruction says hand wash only."
2,the quality of these items was poor,The glass was thin and broke easily. It reminds me why i should never buy items made in China. I regret the purchase
1,winestuff sippers,"I would rate the product I purchased on November 16, 2012 as Christmas gifts, but I have yet to recieve them. Contacted them three times, and each time they said they would be reshipped. Today is December 26, 2012 and I still do not have them."
2,Tiny!!!,"I bought these as a gift for my vino loving sister. Upon arrival these glasses are soooo tiny! I understand they are made for drinking port wine and the concept of the item but they are the size of a child's tea set. However, the item did arrive perfect condition and will make for a unique gift."
3,amack,they look more like little shot glasses u have to be careful with them otherwise they will break would not order I will see how long tI will see how long they will last
1,Porto Sippers,"These sippers arrived intact, minus one cracked leg (which I didn't notice at first) that ruined the balance of a sipper. I thought that they were a steal, but the glass is ugly. It isn't clear, it's dirty. All of this would have been a compromise worth making, but all of these sippers are different. The lengths of the neck all vary, from really short to barely enough. Non of them were broken, just poorly made. I would suggest investing slightly more for an item that wont aggravate."
3,very tiny,"They are extremely cute, but they are very very small. I was expecting them to be the size of an average wine glass, but they are not."
1,More like prank glasses,"These sippers have the legs set so far underneath the bowl that they tip over so easily you'd think they were designed to be prank glasses. The first time we used them, we tipped them over three times within five minutes! (And we hadn't started drinking.) We purchased these because we have had other sippers (perfectly balanced ones from a quality manufacturer) that were quite nice, but broke a couple as they are very delicate, so sought replacements. We gave these away to our college-student nephew, who says he has great fun using them to pull jokes on his friends. Seriously, no matter how careful you are with them, they are so tippy you are sure to have an accidental spill."
5,If you liked the movie and it's music you'll like this CD.,"I've always thought that when you hear a soundtrack and it's a good one, you don't need to see the movie to know what's going on. From the rousing ""A Bridge Too Far March"" to the ""Bailey Bridge"" piece this soundtrack is a classic. I've been after this one in England for ages, and it's a worthy addition to my collection. Not only for the music content but for the Bonus CD-Rom feature of the movies theatrical trailer. I would recommend this soundtrack to any avid collector. A well overdue release.""And the Germans, well naturally they're the badguys!""""Three days they said, we've been hear nine!""These and many other lines come to mind every time I listen to this CD. Buy it!I would also like to say I have been most impressed with Amazons service in providing CDs and DVDs at competitive prices with fast deliveries. ""As you know, I've always thought we tried to go A Bride Too Far..."""
4,Very long awaited release,"After watching the movie many years before, I was very impressed from the music. But I could not get the disc. Maybe 2 years later the disc was released. Parallel to this, I waited for the release of the CD since the medium was introduced. Now it has come true.This is a straight forward war soundtrack with a marching bias. The glorious rhythms representing the advancing of the allied troups are contrasted by slow movements unveiling the coming tragedy. As described above, the unique quality of the score is the marching (in the words best sense) character of many tracks (sample ""air lift""). Unfortunately the melodious invention of the composer is sometimes limited. There is rarely some development in the themes.The technical quality is good but there are sometimes disortions. There is no sound improvement compaired to the disc.My recommendation: buy it!"
5,GRAN DISCO DE UNA GRAN BANDA DESCONOCIDA,"POCOS SON LOS GRUPOS QUE TIENEN LA FORTUNA DE CONTAR ENTRE SUS FILAS CON UN CANTANTE DE ALTURA, TERRY BROCK ES UNO DE LOS TALENTOS MAS DESPERDICIADOS EN EL ROCK,EN ESTE DISCO NOS MUESTRA COMO ADAPTAR SU GRAN VOZ A UNA GRAN SERIE DE CANCIONES COMO WHERE ARE THEY NOW, EVERY TIME YOU CRY, TALK TO ME, Y LOVE LIES DYING, ES UNA PENA QUE LAS COMPAÑIAS DISQUERAS Y EL RADIO NO PROMUEVAN DISCOS COMO ESTE, YA QUE GRACIAS A ELLOS ESTOS ARTISTAS NO RECIBEN EL RESPETO Y RECONOCIMIENTO QUE SE MERECEN,SI ERES FAN DEL MEJOR HARD ROCK COMBINADO CON TOQUES DE BANDAS COMO JOURNEY , ESTE ES TU DISCO, TAMBIEN RECOMIENDO SU DISCO ANTERIOR ""NATIVE SONS"" DE 1987, SON LOS DOS UNICOS EN LOS QUE CANTA TERRY BROCK QUE AHORA ENCUENTRAS EN ""THE SIGN"" Y EN LOS COROS DE VARIOS ALBUMES DE KANSAS DE LOS 80"
3,A little too scientific for the average reader,"I found the theories to be very interesting, but found the author tended to repeat himself. I also felt the wording was a little too ""scientific"" for the average reader. With that said; I still may look read more of his books."
2,"Interesting subject, boring book.","The book is interesting but weaves the theory of evolution into nearly every page. Too preachy on the subject of evolution, genes, etc. Highly sophisticated language, complex scientific jargon used a little too often. Not recommended for the average ""unscientifically-trained"" reader."
2,Hindsight is 20 / 20,"I purchased this item as a gift for a friend. I admit, it has great features, namely, it's portable, It has TV / Weather broadcast capabilities, and its a Sony. For the most part it is a great item, w/ great sound....BUT....it is not very user friendly. The buttons are too close together. The display is way too dark when you are trying to tune in a station, but even more importantly, the display letters are so flippin' small, you need a magnifying glass to see what it says. (which mode you are in) Not one of Sony's well thought out products. Definitely not up to their name. If you don't have 20/20 Vision--Don't buy this item!"
1,Terrible product,"I'm returning this item. The battery compartment will not stay closed. If I pick up the device, or if I move it, the battery compartment comes open. It just won't stay shut securely."
5,great intro to low-dimensional topology,"This is a great intro book for someone interested in low-dimensional topology. It is very clear and well-written, assumes only what you can find in an introduction to topology like Hatcher's, and gives an intuitive explanation of many important results which are a prerequisite for working in low-dimensional topology, although, since it is just an intro, it does not include full proofs. I would recommend this book for someone curious to learn some basic facts, and it's a fantastic way for a new topologist to get introduced to the field. For example, it includes a useful section on Kirby calculus which eases the jump to in-depth works like Gompf and Stipsicz."
4,"Fine, but....","I bought this in like Spring of 1989 and it was recorded in late 1988. When I bought it, I was going to go see them in like two weeks on the Headbanger's Ball tour with Exodus and Anthrax. I thought it was a good cd, I wish it could have been longer. Then two weeks later, I saw them and they played the same exact set in the same order with Michael Kiske doing some of the same introductions. My fault for buying it before I saw them, but now it is kind of like a souvenir from the show because it is very similiar to when I saw them in 89. A good cd and the last testement to that sound for Helloween as that would soon change and it was also the last release with Kai Hansen as he quit in the middle of the tour. Roland Grapow had replaced him by the time I saw them and I was shocked because I did not know ahead of time and I wondered about the future of the band because Kai had done so much of the writing."
1,deceiving,"good guitars and bass - boring, very boring, drums - vocals .... boring, too.the only positive thing was the low price.if you want to know what is heavy metal, please listen to Iron Maiden, Iced Earth (and some other, of course) and you will be IN HM."
4,better than the book,"""Doctor Faustus"" was another book we were forced to read in our AP English class- and it was pretty interesting. But, like always, I learned a lot more from reading the Cliffs Notes than from reading the play.This edition of the Notes really puts many of Christopher Marlowe's themes into a new light and expounds on the overall plot structure beautifully.I found the character biographies to be more than adequate and the plot summary on each act of the play very helpful.Having read Goethe's original novel ""Faust"", Marlowe's version is a lot better- and is even better once you read the Notes. Another superb job, Cliff."
1,Very Flimsy - Bad Design,"I want to start off by mentioning I usually buy products that have several 5 star reviews and there is always someone who doesn't like an item, but I have to admit, this item is not worth the 5 stars.I bought a Summer Infant Bassinet from Amazon just a week prior and my parents were looking for a nicer bassinet for their home. I found this one and thought it was so pretty in the picture, however, good luck getting it to look like the picture in your home.The worst part about this item was the ""pre-drilled"" holes were nowhere close to where they needed to be. The directions were very limited and left you guessing. Lastly, this whole piece is very flimsy, we won't be keeping the canopy on for fear of it just falling over.I would not suggest this product because there are much higher quality bassinets on the market for a much better price."
4,Love it!,Came quickly and was the right color. Had a broken piece but was really impressed the company included replacement pieces
4,Very cute,"Love the bassinet, it's very cute. Sturdier then the average plastic bassinet. Very easy to assemble. Wish the weight limit was a bit higher."
4,Very good coveralls,"For the price I think this product is very decent. The medium I think runs a little big, but it still does the trick. Very good product."
1,Pretty lame..,"Disappointing....I purchased two of these sets at a local retailer for my 6 year old twins. We had them for a little less than a week when the string popped loose from one side of the metal crimper on BOTH BOWS! Of course once it pops out it is impossible to put back and tighten up and it's impossible to get the crimper off the string. I finally cut the string just below the crimper but it was too short to safely knot and put back on the bow. After looking closely, all the youth bows manufactured by Bear Archery use the same method to make the end loops of the string. I will not buy another Bear Archery product, nor would I recommend this to a friend."
3,"Songs from cartoon series ""Mission Magic""","When Springfield was faltering during the mid 70's he did a Saturday morning cartoon series called ""Mission Magic"" that ran for about two years on ABC. During each show there was a song that he recorded that went along with the theme of the show. Here are the songs from the cartoon series. Most of these have been out of print for quite some time. The sound quality is good on the new CD, I'm not sure if it has been remastered or not, but it sounds like it has. Not alot that stands out of the 16 tracks, just bouncy 70's pop. Highlights are ""I Want You,"" Starlight, Starbright,"" ""We're Gonna Have A Good Time,"" and ""You Can Really Do It."" A must for Springfield collectors."
1,Weakest RS album I've ever heard,"My bad: Must've been fooled by the song clips or confused this with another album!This one appears to be someone's attempt to make some easy $$$ by re-issuing a terrible Rick Springfield album which undoubtedly flopped (in whole or in part) originally... if it was ever issued 'back when.'Get ""Beginnings"" if you want a truly fine early R.S. album. (Comic Book Heroes and Wait For Night are pretty good, too)"
4,Good interpretation,"I had the privelege of playing in a master class for her two years ago, and it was one of the coolest experiences I've ever had. She has great insight into performing pieces with stories that you create inside your mind to accompany the music (found this out when our flute studio chatted with her at dinner the night before). Her interpretation of the Copland Duo is one of the more emotionally revealing performances I've ever heard. This is a good quality flute CD and well worth the money."
5,Great!,"The pulse of The Walls of Jericho beats to the music of the characters' intelligence, self-reliance, commitment,and friendship. Although the sting of racism is a central theme, Fisher shines a greater light on the plague of ""colorism"" and its implications in the African-American culture. Ruldoph Fisher has authored a work that affords me the opportunity to teach high school students a novel that does not weigh its reality on the scales of profanity and promiscuity.What a delight! Finally, to help readers with the melodious dialect and slang used by the ever emerging characters, an index of ""possible"" unfamilar terms is provided."
4,Fantastic,"There is only one word I can use to describe this and that is fantastic. This book is very well written and contains a good message about peoples personalities. Not only is this book interesting but it is funny as well. If you read any book in the next few months, read this one."
1,Get another brand.,What a POS. The quality of this is junk. Adds a nice whine when your driving. Easy to install but is bulky and hard to fit in any dash. Get something else.
4,a little confusing,"This is the second attempt for a wiring harnes for a 2004 Grand Am with the monsoon sound system. I first bought the non OnStar harness not realizing that it was also for a non amplified system. The GMOS-04 is the correct harnes but it has more wires than needed because of the OnStar option. It worked out great, you just have to pay extra attention when wiring."
1,Don't waste your money !!!,"This this was HORRIBLE !! Spent $50 on it and it made the BOSE speakers crackle really bad and the volume would raise and lower without warning. The knob that is supposed to adjust the output is worthless. Generally just really poor quality unit. Buy the more expensive one, or just do what I did and get rid of the BOSE stuff all-together....."
1,Worthless,"I was very excited to finally get my new stereo installed when I get a call from the installer. He says the wiring harness is defective. After discussing it with him he says that this model breaks all the time, and is considering not accepting it in the future when a customer brings it in. Now I'm out even more time and money, do not buy."
3,Confusing,Did work... For vehicles that have bose with a factory amplified system you have to give the pink wire 12 volt signal to turn on bose amp much like an external amp or door speakers will not work... Also bulky to put back in dash but does work just fine... 2005 gmc sierra with bose and onstar
4,works good,works good so far but dont like the fact that it displays the sat radio on the dash now other than that easy to install
4,One Thing Could Be Improved,"Just include information on what other harnesses you may need to install everything into your vehicle. I didn't order the steering wheel harness, as I did not know I needed it as well, and ended up waiting another week to have it all installed."
4,Onstar interface,Onstar interface works as expected. I replaced the stock stereo and installed the Pioneer 930 and was able to make the steering wheel controls and Onstar work together.
2,Don't buy this one,"This makes your Onstar and other chimes sound like some toy. Which is very annoying. Seller refused to take it back, now I am stock with this junk."
1,This product does not work with headunits that have 5v preouts.,"I wish someone would have posted this or better yet the manufacturer actually listed it in the description. This interface only works with lower end head units with 2v preouts. If you use 5v preouts you will end up with distorted sound and crackling from the Bose system. So now I'm stuck with this 80 dollar hunk of junk and my very nice avic x940bt. The only recourse I've seen is cranking the potentiometer on the gmos-04 all the way to the max, however this doesn't always work."
5,A sleeper!,"In the late 80's when everyone was focused on the ""hat-acts"" and fresh faces, the Gentle Giant brought forth this stunning sleeper that has went overlooked. No big hits are here but the voice of Mr. Williams is every bit as good as before.""Learn To Let It Go"" is a song about fretting over lost love only to be rewarded with finding that person who made you forget all about the hurt and agony.""One Good Well"" and ""I've Been Loved By The Best"" are two ultimate love songs with a common theme of having the best in a marriage/relationship.All in all, this a great album without a weak track on there."
3,Wrong size,"The description for the product stated that it ""fits most camcorder models"". As our camcorder isn't a new or unusual size, we thought it would fit. We should have researched further, because it didn't fit and wasn't returnable.I'm sure it's a fine battery for the proper camera."
2,Not at all what I needed,This is an old Promise Keepers text that works together with a group of texts that Promise Keepers no longer uses.
2,Poor Quality,"When I first bought this phone I loved it and went out and bought another one just like it, but with an answering machine too. The reception was perfect, but now a year later the caller ID screens on both of them no longer work at all. Very poor quality and durability for a Sony."
1,Not too good!,"At first I was thrilled with my new phone. Then the battery life declined, then the deleting of phone calls on the ID got annoying then the charger decided that it just didn't want to work anymore. By then the warranty wore out and having it fixed was not cost effective. My advice, take a couple steps up or down the Sony price ladder of it's a Sony you want."
5,Excellent Phone!,We replaced our non-Sony phone in our bedroom with this one and we haven't had any problems with it - in fact we use it more that the main phone in the living room! We've had it for about a year I'd guess and now we are looking for the same style to replace the one in our living room! :)An excellent phone at a very nice price... a great buy. :)
2,not very helpful,"Contrary to the other reviewer I did not find this book very helpful at all. This may be due to the fact that whatever I was looking for I did not find in there. If you just need basic vocabulary this book might be alright for you. If you, however, intend to use it for more professional purposes, you might find it not so suitable. It is an interesting approach, but personally I'm happier with dictionaries and learning material from Collins / Pons, who tend to produce books which cost less than Longman's and are better."
2,Dragger,"This gig bag did not meet my expectations. There is no bottom support so when I pull it along, the bottom folds and drags on the ground. Very disappointing."
5,A Must Have For Anyone in Film Development,"Derek Rydall delivers the most practical application to script and story analysis out there. His consciousness and knowledge in the art of screenplay analysis are second to none. Whether you are a writer, a producer, executive, development assistant or aspiring to any and all of the above-- this book is a must have."
1,dissatisfied,"The advertisement states drum KIT, what kit? there was only a drum, which never operated properly, my drum light continues to flash and when I emailed the company regarding this matter, I never got a response(I mistakenly rated this item with a star, it shouldn't have a star).I'll never order from this company again."
3,Money facts galore!,Interesting little book with many facts and quotes about money. I find it enjoyable and a refreshing read.
1,westy1264,"I have read The Total Money Makeover by Dave Ramsey and it is an excellent book. Priceless, however, is worthless. Skip this book and purchase Total Money Makeover which is educational and motivating."
1,Um... yeah,"No matter how old I live to be, I will never understand how so many people can be so stupid as to believe this garbage. The complete and utter disregard (and in fact, hatred for) facts boggles the mind. If you hear something you don't like, ignore it. If there are facts to back it up, ignore those. If these facts happen to be overwelming, commonsensical, and almost hitting you in the face, respond that those you disagree with are liers and have been decieved and that I'm right because my interpretation of a book (written not by God, but by living and falable human beings mind you...) says so. If you really believe dinosaurs lived alongside humans on an earth no more than 4,000 years old you need to have your head examined. Seriously. Stop eating the lead paint chips and get some psychological help. In the meantime, please give your children over to protective services before they start burning copies of the National Geographic or pass out the Kool-Aid to their friends. Hail Tiktaalik!"
1,claptrap of the worst sort,"Great book for those who want to hide from reality, and insist on making sure their children suffer from that same sort of mental illness."
1,I Don't Want To Live On This Planet Anymore,"lol...Dinosaurs in Eden. Where to begin? The Earth is 6,000 years old...dinosaurs coexisted with man. I thought this was a joke at first. I don't have problems with lying to children about Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy, but telling stories about Jesus Horses is absolutely shameful. This belongs in the Onion."
