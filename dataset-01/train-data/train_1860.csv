3,Started out ok....but grew boring after awhile.,I prefer the excitement of reeling in a large mouth bass inBassMasster 2000 over the violence in this game. END
2,"The same book as ""Flea Market Style""","I liked Flea Market Style, by the same authors, so bought this title, too. It's almost the exact same book. At least 12 projects/photos are exactly the same. Since each book is only about 130 pages long, this means both books together only make up one book's material. When I buy 2 different titles, I expect 2 different books. I will not purchase anything else by these authors, since they duplicate their material."
2,sizing is wrong,"The costume is cute, but the sizing is all wrong. I bought a small, which was described as appropriate for ages 3-4. My nephew is 3. The shirt squeezed the life out of him, but the pants were too big. What shape did they make this for? How could a 4 yr old fit into the shirt? They are so opposite in fit that I wonder if a mistake was made. Please check the sizing!!!"
4,I liked it .......,"The game is a lot of fun , that I can't deny . However , a game that lets you commit crimes such as murder , ect...is strictly for older kids . I liked playing it and would love info on a sequeal."
2,Great Price Horrible Ink Quality,"If you've ever used Lexmarks brand before you'll agree with me when I say its anything but great, but this product is no different. I saw the Rhinotek brand double pack for $31 and a single Lexmark cartirdge for $25. I went for the double pack and was severly disapointed. At first the in has more trouble comming out than the Lexmark then after it does it has a wider spay so when I printed photos it make the black eliments hazzy. It also ruined some of my video label by covering the colored lettering with black. So take my advise don't buy this prodct."
1,I've heard better boots...and the tracklist is WRONG!,"The sound quality here is not even to the standard of most bootlegs. It looks to me that Wetton is following in the footsteps of his old KC pal R. Fripp who has been releasing awful audience recordings of Crimson shows for several years now.But at least Crimson's releases get the track listing right.Track 2 is actually Heat of the MomentTrack 3 is Book of SaturdayTrack 4 is Sole SurvivorTrack 12 is Battlelines not Starlessetc, etc....Did Wetton actually have anything to do with this? Bootleggers do it better...It's time for the record industry to offer money back guarantees, because I want my money back for this disc NOW!"
1,Was not what I ordered,"I was ordering a set of cartridges which I thought were all going to be from Xerox and not some refill or cloned product. When I got the black cartridge which showed as being (Xerox 106R00675 Black Hi Cap) online, it was actually some cloned product not even in a Xerox box, and the bag it was in was not even sealed. Anyway, I don't like to be mislead."
3,Concrete review,Video seemed to be a little outdated as there are some newer tools out there for laying concrete but overall the video was was very instructional. I would have liked to have seen some of the things to avoid when stamping concrete.
1,Regret buying this,"There are better shows on cable TV, or PBS for that matter, showing how to stamp concrete. At best this video provides an overview of the process. There is nothing in it about ordering (other than volume calcs.) Nothing about stamp placement and tamping techniques (other than ""be sure they're touching"") Nothing about correcting errors or mistakes. In short, if you can place and broom finish a slab, you already know 95% of what this video demonstrates. (they show how to form a ""radius"" (curve) and how to stake a form for Pete's sake) If you can't place a simple slab you don't have any business stamping concrete.I was really hoping for an instructional video that explained the details of stamping, coloring, staining etc. And I was optimistic that this video would explain the basics of marketing stamped concrete.Don't buy this video it is a waste of money."
1,very disapointed,"I bought this player for my daughter in Feb. of 2000. it broke down twice in six months. The second time I had to send it back I tried to get the company to replace the lemon but all they did was send me a bill. The parts that were repaired had to be made because of lousey workmanship. I would not recomend this player to anyone, especialy at the price they charge for it."
2,Two Thumbs Down,"I hate to join in this chorus of unsatisfied customers, but I'm not given much of a choice. I'm on my 2nd and last Sony Sport Discman. It's been consistently breaking down with either the LCD screen blanking out, the volume adjustment getting screwed up, or it just not working at all. Now, they don't even offer it with a rechargeable battery alternative. I say to SONY--either improve this product, or DO THE RIGHT THING--Take it off the market to not damage SONY's product quality!"
2,not a great product.......,This product was advertised as skip proof and water-resistent and it's niether! You can't go jogging without it skipping every 10 seconds.....and the ESP2 doesn't work at all! It skips just as much when the ESP2 is on! I don't recomend this CD player.....you should definetly look for a better product!
3,Good for a Little While,"This is acually a good player when you first purchase it. You really notice the sound quality and the different features such as ""groove"" and ""mega bass"" functions. The water resistant body is also good for pool side listening. The head phones that are included are not very good ones and are easy to break. They also feel very weak when you wear them. The anti-shock memory could have more capacity but with the locking hood, it helps. This is a great CD player until it begins to age. After a year and two months, mine started to act up. You would have to push play three or four times before it would start. The LCD screen started to blink and go out at times. Eventually you have to put foil on the button inside or else the CD player will not know the lid is closed. Then my motor went out. This is a good player but for a short amount of time."
2,"Display says, ""No disc"".","Mine worked fine for about the first ten months. It was not taken outdoors. It was not dropped. It sat in the family room using two little speakers from Radio Shack where I listened to it while working on the computer. Then one day, out of the blue, I get the ""no disc"" message. It will not work regardless of what I do. I called Sony, but that was not helpful as it is now out of warranty. Therefore, I now have a disc player that will not play."
4,Fun and free to play online with other users,"This game is so fun to play with other people online, me and my friend vs each other over the internet with other people too from all over the world and have tons of fun the only problem is when other people have bad connections then the game goes really slow, that's it's only downside for online another thing is you can only have 2 logins for the game but that's actually for the better ,but besides online gaming the campaigns are pretty good hope this helps."
5,"great game,one flaw",once you pop the game into your computer i guarentee you you will regret to take it out. just go into skirmish and master your skills and then take on the missions.the only flaw to this game is that if you have the mininal amount of mhz. it will take for ever to just get into the game. but still buy it because the gameplay will make up for the time wasted getting in to the game.
5,The best strategy game I have ever seen!,"This is the best strategy game of the year. I agree with all of the critcs saying so. The Command and Conquer series is a great strategy forming game. The graphics would be an 8/10. The gameplay would be a 9/10. The characters are awesome. You will feel the power of GDI's Mammoth Mark II, while NOD's chemical and multi missles will leave you stunned. 38 great mission of pure fun! And after you beat the game play Skirmishes or Made Up Games by picking a terrain or making your own. This is an absolutely amazing game. Pick it up at a store, and while your at it pick up Firestorm Expansion Pack. They cost together like 15 bucks. Cheap for an awesome game."
5,The Greatest of the C+C Series,"I have owned C+C T.S. for some time and I have found how it surpasses all of the other C+C games. First because for a strategy game, the graphics are very good especially if you compare them to the graphics of Red Alert and the first C+C. The sound and music are excellent (I bought the soundtrack because I thought it was so good) I also like the level of challenge and there are no cheats for the game, so you have to use all of your skills. I love all of the units that you can make and all of the buildings you can construct. The skirmish is also a great aspect of the game. The storyline is also very intriguing and the live-action cut scenes are very cool and star some very popular actors.If you are a fan of the series, this is the one you should be playing!"
2,Bargain bin at release,"I wanted Tiberian Sun from the day I heard it was in the make. I thought Westwood had taken the Blizzard route and waited until a game was near perfect to release it. WRONG. This game is nothing short of terrible. You have 2 races and basically the same troops for each race with few exceptions. There are no powerups and no upgrades. I thought Red Alert was an excellent game until Starcraft was released. Believe me dont waste your money on this game. It is not up to par with Red Alert and not even on the same planet as Starcraft or Age of Empires II. Save your cash and get Starcraft or AOE II if you want a real time strategy game. It has deformable terrain which is an interesting idea, thus, the extra star. Otherwise it earns 1 star in all catergories, ecspecially graphics, its like watching an ant farm at work."
1,it sucked,"For god's sake westwood, what were you thinking? THe AI is complete jack and it has all been done before. Give up the action-strategy games westwood. They're a joke now."
1,After a while it gets better,I had been waiting for TS for 2 years i was so hyped up about it i checked numerous web sites on it every day. i got it the day it came out and it was okay in the begining and then got boring It was very dissapointing and was dumb i never even got to the NOD cd the game play got old because it was the same thing over and over again build build attack build build build build build build later on you get commando missions but thats about it
1,What A Let Down,"What a let down C&C Tiberian Sun is. After the great C & C games this is a joke. Earth 2100 leaves it for dead. After waiting so long for it I rushed into the city to buy it when I heard it was finally released, never again Westwood. I'll read the reviews first then buy in future."
1,Not very Different,"oooohhhh ahhh, New Graphics, New Weapons. God, ALL they did was change the environment. The Characters look worse then the original C & C games. The only credit I give them is how well they made the background, the meteor showers, and the Ice that breaks. If you played the original C&C don't bother with this game. If you haven't played the original C&C I guess you can give it a try, trust me there are better games anyways."
2,Terribly disappointing,"Years in the making, and we get a pale shadow of games that competitors shipped years before.Tiberian Sun is a very minor update of Command & Conquer, and while WestWood bootstrapped this genre into glory with the original, this awaited update comes with less than half the class of StarCraft or Total Annihalation.If you liked Command & Conquer & you want more, look to Blizzard's StarCraft or Cavedog's TA. Westwood's just looking to get another $ from you without attempting to improve the original in anything more than trival ways."
5,"oh just great, another 5 stars","This game is a good one. I play a lot of computer games, but this one takes the cake. Outstanding options and online play against your friends or someone in a real tournament game. The only thing next is to download tiberian sun gold from a certain ex-producer, and the game is perfect."
3,A disappointment after Red Alert,"I think Red Alert is one of the greatest games of all times so I was really looking forward to Tiberian Sun. Needless to say, I was disappointed. It's hard to pinpoint why this game isn't as good. As stated in other comments, buy Starcraft or Red Alert if you don't have them and pass this one by."
4,Nothing new but a blast nonetheless,I don't normally play strategy games but this one has really caught my attention. I played the original C&C: Red Alert and I realize Tiberian Sun hasn't brought much new to the genre but this game still manages to be addictive. The cut-scenes are great with possibly the first good acting ever in a computer game. Get a a couple of friends to buy this game for the multi play as that is one of the best parts about the game and it is very satisfying to storm a buddies base. The graphics and sound are good also. Buy it.
3,More of the same,"Unfortunately this game is just a hodge-podge of elements from the other games. There are some interesting new units, and I did enjoy the much larger maps. My biggest complaint is that it is so short. You are just getting to use some of the more advanced units and the game is over. You never get the big final battle like at the end of the last two incarnations. This is by far the shortest game of the bunch. I finished each side's campaign over the course of three nights, about 9-12 hours of game play."
2,Nothing Special,"If you have already played the original C&C and Red Alert, this game will not be too exciting. I just got done beating both GDI and NOD, and I am still not a fan of the new units. All you need to do is create engineers, and the game is simple. I spent $20 for this game, and I still feel that I didn't get my money's worth."
4,Your going to like it,"C & C is great. The best parts about it are: the improved graphics, the excellent in-depth plot, great maps, and the awsome new units. The cons include poor music, and some ""hard to meet"" requirements. This game is not for children though. It includes extreme realism which adds to game but might frighten a child. Otherwise the game is great, even those who didn't enjoy the original might be suprised by this one."
4,If you liked Red Alert...,"With improved graphics, modified waypoint options, better game engine, and a not-too-shabby (not-that-great either) storyline, fans of strategy-based gaming will probably like this release. The online play was a positive experience as well. A good effort by Westwood, and the expansion pack is great as well. 4 1/2 stars."
4,Good Fun!,"Okay I admit it, the two main reasons I bought this game are James Earl Jones and Michael Biehn, whom I believe are bloody great. However, the game in itself is lots of fun. I'm making my way through the GDI games at the moment, and having a good time!"
2,Tiberian Sun: Can it live up to StarCraft?,"The answer is a simple NO! I owned StarCraft and then got Tiberian Sun. Big mistake. A waste of money on my part because the perfect strategy game was already mine! GDI and NOD have so many building exactly the same names and functions with slightly different looks. BORING! StarCraft's three races have all unique units of which can't be built unless playing as that race. Don't be fooled by the graphics, if have $30-50 bucks, get StarCraft instead of Tiberian Sun. If you own StarCraft, use the money on Brood War or whenever it comes out, StarCraft 2."
3,A review from one of the few who never played a C&C game,"Having not played Red Alert or the original, this game underwhelmed me. It certainly isn't as good as Starcraft or even the old Warcraft 2. It is a decent game, but some of the scenarios were poorly designed. All in all the game isn't bad, but there are better games out there to play. If C&C is a franchise you love, this may be the game for you, but my first contact did not impress me."
5,another game for another c&C fan. yeah.....oh I'm sorry.,"Suprise, suprise.....another game out that is ANOTHER command and CONQUER game. Has anyone heard of the hundreds of doom clones. I like C&C as much as the next gammer,but unless there is a major difference as far as the gameplay goes and a HUNDRED more weapons to chose from, this game is deffinetly of my shopping list!"
1,Don't Even Think About Getting This Game,"Getting this game would be a waste of time and money. For halfthe price of this I'd rather get a game that offers better graphics,better realism, and better everything. If you haven't already guessed it's Red Alert. Even though it looks pretty good, after about a week you won't want to play it anymore. With Red Alert I continually go back to try just one more strategy... I think they just sat down and set a deadline for this game and the guys making it waited until the last week to do it. Right now all you need to do is type in the search box up there ""Red Alert"" and buy that game... You will have a way better game and not spend as much."
1,Major disappointment,"Don't even bother with this game. I love Red Alert, but Tiberian Sun has nothing new or original. Go back to playing starcraft or get the new Age of Empires."
2,Great for baby food...BUT,"I bought this after seeing it in a local store. I had read the online reviews on HB choppers and I thought I would give this one a try.It doesn't chop ..it purees. I have a blender for that. I dried to chop some baby carrots, a small tomato and a green pepper. I followed the directions...small pieces, etc. I ended with a nice mush.Cleaned it up and returned it."
5,I love this little chopper!,I have had several choppers in my time and this is by far the greatest of them all. It is compact and so easy to use and to clean. I love that I can chop and store in one step. It is quicker than quick. If you want larger pieces I suggest you chop by hand. For me this is perfect.
1,make a better game!!,They need to make a better game than this.Only 8 boarders to choose from.Only 7 courses.The one who came up with this must be FIRED!
1,1080 BORING!,this is the stuppidiest game i've ever played. I advise everyone not to play it or buy it. It really sucked.
4,A must-have video game for snowboarding fans!,"1080 Snowboarding is a great game. I've never actually snowboarded much myself, but I loved this game! Different locations, boarders, and boards to choose from. It tells you how fast the boarder is, where he or she comes from, and their name. On locations, you can pick begginer, hard, or expert. I suggest startin off on begginer. If your new at this game, (like me) you will fall off your snowboard a lot, and ""retire"", though you can always start a new game. Practice makes perfect!"
4,THIS GAME KICKS [butt] - BEST SNOWBOARD N64 GAME ON THE MARKET,this game is absolutely amazing. it's easily the best snowboard game for N64. the only bad part about this game is the damage because most of the time you don't make it down the hill before you have to retire from too much damage. definatley buy this game
1,too hard not fun,"this game is the hardest game ive ever played, and that takes away the fun. also graphics very poor even for nintendo 64 cannot even recommend for people i dislike dont waste your time or money worst n64 game ever"
4,"Very realistic for video games, but not quite enough freedom","Best snowboarding video game out, but i think it could easily be improved. They should make you have a little more freedom like you do in other types of games. They should also make a season type mode where you go through a bunch of races and stuff. But, if you are looking for the best snowboard game currently on the market, buy this one!"
4,The greatest snowboarder,"1080 is a very great videogame for N64, I really like it. This game is very intense and fun.I think it is intense because you are racing against other great snowboarders and it is always close at the finish line. I think it is fun because you can win levels and do many tricks such as a 1080. The one thing bad about the game is that it doesn't have many snowboarders. This game also has good graphics. The reason I bought this game, is because I love to snowboard. Buy this game it is at a great price, trust me it is the best snowboarding game you will ever try."
4,A Delicate Harmony,"Aunt Safiyya and the Monastery by Bahaa' Taher has the array of expected elements in a novel that takes places in Upper Egypt in the early to mid-twentieth century. There is the narrator, telling the story as an adult with the required air of nostalgia for a lost way of village life. The narrator's father is the village elder, preaches at the mosque, and is held in high esteem by all. The Coptic monks at the nearby monastery are revered by everyone, including Muslims. Everything is in delicate, even loving harmony.When a blood feud threatens to destroy the village's sense of order, the murderer takes refuge in the Coptic monastery, which is considered a sanctuary by all. And around these minute actions, the fate of modern Egypt is being decided, and a way of life is dying forever.Taher's novel makes the expected moves, but with his fresh voice and delicate eye for detail, there is still a remarkable amount of the unexpected in what could have been a very expected novel."
5,Best Football game,EA sports does it again with this realistic football game. The graphics are great and has smooth game play. Francise mode allows you to play several continuous seasons with the same team. I'd reccommend this game to any sports fan.
3,Football Fans only,"I would not really recomend this game for you if you arent a football fan. The graphics are good, but the game is confusing if you dont like or understand football. If you like football and you want this game, it would be pretty good. But if you dont understand football, even if you like it, i would not recomend this game"
2,Much smaller than anticipated,"Great little mat to put over top of a rear floormat, but not nearly large enough for the back of an SUV as a spill mat. Cute and durable though."
2,Not Nearly as Good as Gates of Fire,"I was really looking forward to this book after reading Gates of Fire. What I got was an author more interested in impressing the reader with all the things he had looked up about Ancient Greek history, rather than concentrating on writing a good novel about a very interesting time. No character is more interesting than Alkibiades - yet I never get the impression the author understood what made the man tick, critical for a novel of this type. I found the narrative voice distracting, and the book did not maintain my interest. Alas, I forced myself to finish it, hoping it would get better, but found out it did not to my regret."
3,Gates of Fire Redux?,"While I found this novel to be interesting, I think that it is a bit on the heavy side of historical fiction. This is especially evident when compared to ""Gates of Fire"" (another Pressfield book). ""Tides of War"" is again told from the point of view of a a witness to greatness. . .but, unlike ""Gates of Fire"" the narrator is too far removed from the story. With this lack of connection, the author is forced to fill space and the story loses itself winding through Athenian politics. The author seems to revel in the interminable plotting of the Greek city-state.This is not to say that the book is bad. As I showed with my 3 star rating, this book is an excellent example of this genre. However, a new reader to this field should perhaps begin with Gates of Fire or perhap's Margaret George's ""Cleopatra."""
3,I wanted to like it!,"I was very excited to get this book and believed I was going to like it very much. However, I was sorely disappointed. This book had no real characterization like in Gates of Fire. I did not come to love the characters; to sympathize with them. If I were to rate this on the content, the history and the materials, I would give it 5 stars because the history is very interesting. Unfortunately I am writing this on the writing which did not impress me. Though I still believe that Mr. Pressfield is a great writer and still continues to be!"
2,Is the Tide going out on Pressfield?,"I picked up ""Tides of War"" expecting another good read like Pressfield's previous novel ""Gates of Fire"". I was disappointed.""Tides"" follows ""Gates"" tactic of telling an epic Greek story from the perspective of a lumpenprole. In this case the story of the Athenian hero/scoundrel Alciabides' rise and flame-out. However, there is something missing here, that was in ""Gates of Fire"". Frankly I found this book boring in comparison. I put it down, uncompleted.If you are interested in historical fiction involving Alciabides, I recommend Rosemary Sutcliff's ""Flowers for Adonis"". I read that book twice.Is the Tide going out on Pressfield?"
2,Save Your Money!,"I forced myself to finish this book. I hate it when I read a book just to finish it, it's like I'm back in school. Well, that is just what I did with ""Tides of War"". Pressfield's stilted language is often times hard to understand. You really have to wade through the words to get to the point of what is going on. Which is disappointing because Alcibiades is one of the most fascinating characters in history.One bright spot of the whole book is the Sicilian expedition chapter. Here Pressfield's writing flows evenly and the story begins to take-off. Unfortunately only to have it crash land again with Pressfield's slow story line.After ""Gates of Fire"" this is a large disappointment."
3,Not as good as the gate of fire,"Well, I love ""gate of fire"", which is probably among the top ten books I have read in my life. ""Tides of the war"" cannot live up with that, probably beacause scope of the war and the time frame were dragging long. It is very hard to use first person tale to describe the complex military and political situation during Peloponnesian War. That is why the book is caught in between, neither it was a good story tale from a microscopic point of one person, nor it is good in the sense of retelling history in macroscopic way. It is still a very good book to read, but compare to ""gates of fire"", you will probably be disappointed."
2,Boring ancient history,Usually Pressfield's books are page turners. This one put me to sleep several times. Reading psuedo ancient Greek rhetoric is not my bag for an historical thriller.
4,Unexpected,"I purchased this book expecting it to be like ""Gates of Fire"", which is possibly one of the best books I've ever read, however, it is not. Though it shares some similar themes and nations, the premise of both are the same and yet completely different. This gives you a look at the Athenian way of life and point of view as seen through the eyes of one of her greatest champions. It shows how fickle the people of Athens were and the dangers of true democracy without checks/balances. It reads slower than Pressfield's other works, but is more telling and more applicable to the state of the world today. If you enjoy historical fiction, you will enjoy the read that this presents."
3,"GOOD, BUT NOT AS GOOD AQS GATES OF FIRE!","This new book by Steve Pressfield is not bad, but not bad is also saying not good. It is somewhere in the middle. Pressfield's previous greek epic, Gates of Fire was far better. A much more compelling story better told. This new book has three levels of narration and does not seem as smooth as the prior book. None of the characters really shine through, including the leads. The book is worth the read but be prepared to be disapointed if you expected another Gates of Fire. My advice? Wait for the paperback."
3,Pressfield delivers again...,"The book is great, but I haven't finished it yet. With his other book, it read well and was a real page turner, and then the ending really blew chunks. It was kind of anti-climatic and I expected more. it was like a great sex session and then a bad orgasm...after that you just don't want to try again for a few days ha ha ha."
2,Poor 2nd attempt after Gates of Fire,"I admit that it's unfair to expect another Gates of Fire -- but I enjoyed that wonderful book so much that I had high hopes for the story of Alcibiades. In fact I couldn't even finish it... rambling, confused and, well, not engaging. I will try another Pressfield book to see which of these efforts represents the real author. If only I could read Gates of Fire for the first time again..."
4,Great book,I'm just going to be kind and say that while this book is somewhat anti climactic and just not as good as Gates of Fire I wasn't expecting it to be something that good is just a tough act to follow.Pressfield always does well capturing a narrative flow but it felt like the book could not make up its mind about weather or not it wanted to be a bio of Alcibidies or an account of the Sicilian Expedition. As a result the book feels like it ends in several places only to limp on for another 50 pages. Still fantastic stuff though and Pressfield is still one of the best.
2,Detailed but ultimately uncompelling,"Pressfield's prior book about the Spartans was a fascinating and compelling story. Sadly, this book doesn't share the same qualities. While both are interesting due to the amount of historical detail about life in that era, the narrator here isn't very interesting and is not close enough to Alcibiades to make his actions come to life. His motives often remain obscure and we don't have enough insight into his genius, if he can be called that. The story jumps around a bit which often lets the steam out of the story."
3,"No ""Gates of Fire"", But Good Nonetheless","Some parts of the book are slow and Pressfield tries to add too much detail on battles and on locations. The details on battles are good when Pressfield writes about the emotion and how soldiers feel, but unless you have a good amount of knowledge on Greek naval formations, you won't really understand much.The things that I liked about the book are the narrations between Polemides and Jason. The speeches that the characters give are some of the best I've read. The battle of Syracuse and the last ""book"" in the novel are, in my mind, worth reading the 400-plus page book.The other thing I liked about the book were the comparisons between the Athenian and Spartan societies, how the oligarchic one defeated the democratic one, which is something that can be translated into today's world if you look past some flaws."
2,Disappointed,"One of the best books I have ever read, if not the best, was ""Gates of Fire"" by the same author. I was really excited about this book, but it was really disappointing, too many boring and useless details, a confusing and messy dialogue, extremely boring and tedious to go through.I also don't understand why the author had to use so much jargon, too much of for example, in describing naval battles a, why?I am sorry to say this book was a total waste of time!"
2,This is no Gates of Fire,"If you don't like reading textbooks, stay away from this one. What a disappointment after Gates of Fire! Though it does have a few good parts, the books mostly drags on and on about the most inane details of Greek history. I don't understand the shift in style; Pressfield should have stuck with what worked before."
1,Story telling at its worst...,"I started reading this immediately after the last REH compilation and there could not be a greater difference in story telling. While REH was first and foremost a story teller, Pressfield uses one of the absolute worst devices in his recount of a grandson of his grandfather's remembering his conversations with a client who knew the famous Alcibiades. This, as previous reviewers have mentioned, creates a large gap between reader and story. But why do this? Why use such a crappy method of story telling? I guess it pads the book with unnecessary dialogue. All in all, it's a slow, uninspired, day dream story. So crappy that I felt it necessary to write this review echoing previous harsh reviews.I want my money back."
4,Great characters + great plot + deep and thoughtful themes = great fiction,"I have to go somewhat against the crowd of reviewers on this one and say how much I enjoyed this book. The character and plot development are complex and with great depth. It is a fine work of fiction of any type - a winning plot, 3-dimensional characters, themes that make you think and that have important implications. It is a study in the kind of characters democricies tend to extol and then demonize. Humanity is indeed fickle. As the author Calvin Miller observed, Palm Sundays and Good Fridays all fall neatly into the same week. Humanity in power as a democracy makes for the same unpredictable shifts in favor in unbelievably fast order.For the character and plot alone this is a great work of fiction, the deep themes make it all the more enjoyable and thought-provoking.Mr. Guidall as narator is, in my opinion, ideal for the reading. His voice and manner seem ideally suited for such a novel. Very well done."
4,Detail is Signifigant,"In this attempt to describe the Greek way of living, fighting, scheming and dying, Mr. Pressfield has done an excellent job. He projects the advantages and disadvantages the majesty and the misery of the Greek society of then, now and probably tomorrow. Scheming, ambition, vanity and self-destruction have always been the key features of the Greek nation's leaders throughout history. Each of these great men that have stamped human history with their genius, warrior's spirit and -unfortunately- libido, have their own little tale that makes their successful efforts amazing. Keep up the good work Mr. Pressfield"
4,Engaging and surprisingly approachable,"This is not my typical genre, nor my usual delivery format. However, I was pleasantly surprised by this little gem (if you can call 4 long-play cassettes little :). The characters are all very approachable, very well developed, and highly sympathetic. The story has depth, texture, and detail that sharpens the focus without tiring the reader. Jacobi's narration is outstanding. Throw this in your car, and give yourself something to look forward to besides the evening traffic."
3,the tarnished age,"i give this a rather low score because i had such high hopes for it. i was certain when i bought it that it was going to be wonderful, but such is not the case, unfortunately. i had heard one song before buying it, and that one song was superb, really groovy and danceable, and i was told the album followed its example. maybe, but that song is three times as good as anything else on the cd. the record is all the buzz here in athens, but i find the guy's voice to be extremely grating. and the music, despite it being dandied-up and watered-down white boy funk, it isn't *bad*, just not good enough to cover for the vocals."
5,good as it gets,"The only thing wrong with this EP is it's just an EP. It's more electronic and a little more Tortoisey than their other stuff. Every track is awesome, but the breakdown at the end of track 3 is just beautiful."
4,A great 'live' album!,"There was a period in the 70's and 80's when record companies would produce albums recorded in studios with a small live audience. They would then market the end result as a 'live' (in quotes) recording, thus having the effect of a live recording, without the costs of putting on a concert. I suspect that this record is one such album. That aside, it has some brilliant songs, recalling the Soul Stirrers' golden era with Sam Cooke and R.H. Harris. I first had this on cassette tape in the 70's (which fell apart many years ago) and I search far and wide for it ever since. Now that I found it, nearly 30 years later, it sounds every bit as good as I remembered. This is a worthy CD for any Soul Stirrers fan's collection."
3,A GOOD ALBUM BUT NOT GREAT,"THIS CD WAS ISSUED IN 1995 AS A CASSETTE. I WILL HAVE TO ADMIT THAT I AM NOT A FAN OF THIS GROUP THAT CALL THEMSELVES THE SOUL STIRRERS BUT OVERALL THIS IS A GOOD ALBUM BECAUSE THEY DO A PRETTY GOOD JOB IN SINGING MANY OF THE SOUL STIRRERS HITS WHICH FEATURED SAM COOKE. ARTHUR CRUME, DILLARD CRUME, LEROY CRUME, FRANK DAVIS, AND JAMES DAVIS ARE FEATURED ON THIS RECORDING WITH FRANK DAVIS AND DILLARD CRUME SINGING THE PARTS OF SAM COOKE AND PAUL FOSTER RESPECTIVELY AND JAMES DAVIS HAVING ONLY SINGING ON THE END OF ""HE IS ABLE"". IT IS FUNNY THAT HOW AFTER ALL OF THE YEARS MR. DAVIS WAS LEAD VOCALIST THAT NOW THAT THE GROUP HAS ACQUIRED SOMEONE WHO SOUNDS A LITTLE MORE LIKE SAM COOKE THEY HAVE MOVED HIM FROM LEAD TO A BACKGROUD SINGER. A GOOD ALBUM TO HAVE IN YOUR COLLECTION BUT THIS GROUP CANNOT TOUCH THE GROUP CALLING THEMSELVES THE ORIGINAL SOUL STIRRERS."
1,Don't waste your dollars !!!,"Dennis Miller is a hypocrite and an angry comedian as well as an awful television show host that turned politician. He uses a sensational pseudo-conservative style of venomous insults and loud belligerence to make a buck. He has aligned himself with the right people, in order to advance his limited and uneventful career. He is being used by the media executives to advance their corporate political agenda.His writers have done a good job launching a below average comedian and making him a political ""idiot savant.""Comedians should stick to comedy.Save your money!!"
4,"Of course, this is just my opinion, I could be wrong...","It's a good book, but unlike George Carlin's and Chris Rock's books (which have added extras not featured in their respective HBO specials) these are just the Rants. Nothing more, nothing less."
4,Reading Ranting is Hard Work,"This book kept me laughing out loud while I read it on an airplane. The other passengers no doubt thought I was nuts. Some of the references he uses are stretched pretty thin, but they are entertaining nevertheless. Most of the material takes concentration to fully appreciate, but it is a welcome relief from the Bevis & Butthead humor found so often today."
1,lost in space,What happened to this guy? He used to be funnybut no more. It seems that comedy has been replacedby thinly cloaked hostility. Maybe he'll experiencean attack of conscience and retire.
1,"Et tu, Miller?","I used to love this guy, but after his appearence on Donahue my opinion has changed. It's wacky, and I don't get it. But I no longer believe a lot of these rants are from the heart. I guess it's just that his writers are more liberal than he is."
1,not as funny as the miniskirted McCarthy,"If you can imagine a miniskirted McCarthyite riding a Clydesdale in Tolstoy's Russia, you might be able to fathom the absurdity of this book.Remember: The Right wing tells lies. They want your money so they can buy drugs and gamble in casinos. Ignore them!"
1,Monday Night Mac Arthee,"Ever since Miller was punted from previous gig, he apparently has a lot of time on his hands. Is he bitter? If you can imagine a miniskirted right wing blond riding the Clydesdales in Tolstoy's Russia, you might conclude Miller has been always already unfunny.Remember: The right wing lies. The right wing hates. They only want your money so they can buy drugs or gamble. Ignore them!"
4,Worthwhile Rants,"First, I should admit that I am a fan of Dennis Miller. I think he is intelligent and funny. His comedy takes at least a certain amount of intelligence and education to understand. I appreciate having to think and be somewhat aware of my culture and environment to get many of the jokes.I think Miller's ranting style is funny, too. I can hear his voice as I read the rants in his various books. I even occasionally laugh out loud reading him which is very rare for me.This particular volume of rants (his third) is classic Miller. If you like his style then you'll like this book. Its one weakness was the Clinton/Lewinsky joke came up way too many times. His ability to come up with a unique skew on things is too good to fall back on this chestnut as many times as he does.This is a small complait, though, about what is generally a very funny book."
4,More good rants,"The metaphorically talented Dennis Miller comes through with another fine performance with 'I Rant, Therefore I Am'. I listened to the 2 cd version. I have to admit that I liked his previous audios better. I still got a great kick out of this cd and as usual I think Dennis hits the nail on the head 95% of the time.Keep up the rants....Recommended"
2,Can't really recommend ...,"I have had a few problems with this product since day one. The product comes disassembled, requiring you to insert wire legs into a pipe on each side of the body. This was not easy to do and required bending the body to open a path for insertion. Some strength is required. Assembly complete. To make the product stand as in the image you hold the body cage and push down each leg until it wedges between vertical wires of the cage body. In my case the legs frequently pop out (each side). When the legs are raised for storage/transport, there is no latch to hold them up and the legs naturally fall into a horizontal position (I have taken to using a velcro strap between them to keep them up. Finally, when transporting or using the Risette to pick up balls, the handles (shown as the bars between the feet in the image) rotate around the body to meet flush together above the cage and it's fairly easy to pinch your hand."
3,"A good reference book but poor ""learning guide""","This book is probably the 300lb Gorilla of ASP coding. Similar to many of QUE's special editions, this publication is a compilation of material written by multiple authors. Although I still recommend this book as reference, speaking as a corporate trainer I find the logic and flow of the material a bit lacking for ASP beginners. Many of the topics are arranged in haphazard order. Most of the code examples in the early (framework) part of the book are peppered with VBscript statements that haven't been covered yet...a terrible sin and one that makes the sample code more confusing and almost counterproductive. If you already understand VBscript fundamentals this book would no doubt be helpful but if you're looking for hands-on-learning look elseware !"
3,"A lot of good content, but still leaves a lot to be desired","This book has a lot of good information, but it also has problems. Tons of typos. References to ""the CD at the end of the book"" (there isn't one!). VERY wordy; he repeats basics a lot (e.g. ""an object has METHODS and PROPERTIES"" he repeats this, even 300 pages into the book). The index is good, but not great. Some of his instructions just don't work, when he either leaves out a step or makes an incorrect assumption about my system (e.g. he apparently assumes the reader is using NT Server--in fact, I'm using NT Workstation).In key areas, the book is very shallow. He barely mentions the ""metabase"" that IIS 4 uses instead of the registry. My biggest complaint: The chapter on Microsoft Transaction Server is frustratingly brief--it doesn't even discuss transaction-related methods, such as BeginTrans or CommitTrans.The absence of a CD-ROM is also a strike against it."
1,"This book really deserves 0.5 of a star, at best","I made the mistake of buying the book as well, before consulting the online reviews (I will never do that again). I knew neither ASP nor VBScript going in. Nonetheless, I could tell right off the bat that there were errors on almost every page. At one point, I was even turned off to the whole idea of ASP. This has since changed - I got the Beginning and professional ASP books (Ben Francis et al - 2 seperate books) and they are way, way better. So in conclusion - DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!"
2,Don't waste your money!,"Like most QUE books, this book is practically unreadable. I planned to use this book to practice ASP at home where I use Personal Web Server as I'm sure most of other readers do. However, it pushes IIS so severely that I was forced to buy another book that is easier to read and gives me what I need. It's horrible as a reference too. The index is practically a list of available functions."
1,Wasted my money..,"I like everbody else thought this would be a good choice from the ""Using Series"". I was wrong, the author's makes no point of naming their sample files so you can't test them as you learn or know where you are at at any time. When I wrote to the author (my first time) he wrote me back saying he understood my dilema and responded, give me a week and I will send you the file names.. ""NO REPLY"".. Save your money and buy the Wrok book. Which I did.. provides you with step by step instructions. The Using book asumes you know everything, if that is the case, I wouldn't need the book.. ""Using"" is ""Using"" you.."
2,Could be much more practical in much less words,"The author is spending a lot of words on the things that are not the subject of the book (like using Microsoft FrontPage). The book tells ""you can do this, you can do that"", not ""why you need this, how you do that, why it is useful, what for""."
3,Comprehensive but not well organized,This book is more like a reference type of documentation. My biggest concern is the many typos and errors in some of the examples given. I expected more from QUE editors before releasing a book with so many mistakes to the public.
3,Reference Material....,"Maha, MA, USA I bought this book one month back in Burlington. Author gives lot of information on ASP, VBScript. ADO etc. But i feel this book can be used only by experience programmers... not for beginners. The book starts as a Beginner Tutorial.. but it became A Reference Material for ASP. Has got some information on Transaction Server, etc. but not clear. If U know ASP, this is right one for u to improve skills in ASP."
4,"It's ok, but not organized well it seems","This book is ok, but it needs to talk more about real world examples. The vbscript primer is good, but the book jumps around too much and doesn't seem to be well organized. I also think there should be more examples on using the lowest common denominator, eg., Forms, etc, instead of the Active X stuff."
1,Lots of error,Just don't buy it. The worst ASP book I ever read! Very hard to read and there are lots of code error in the book.
1,A very poorly written book. Do not buy,"I suppose that the first clue to the number of errors in the book is the fact that they were unable to get the author's first name spelled correctly.Be warned that the ASP examples in this book are riddled with errors. I've had to spend an inordinate amount of time figuring out the correct syntax of commands and make sense of the many inconsistencies in the book.It's also interesting that Que books is unable to spell even the easiest of terms correctly (e.g. ""OLE"" is spelled ""OEL"" in some places; ""ASP"" is spelled ""APS"" is some places, etc.)Save your money & your time; you'll find that the WROX books are edited and proofread much better."
1,Bad Code!!,"I don't know why anyone would rate this book any higher than a one if they read the whole thing. Creating your own ActiveX Server Components is the single most important thing about using ASP technology for developers and yet the code offered by the book screws that up! Just look at Chapter 18, page 402, listing 18.12 SCCLASS.CLS. Anyone who understands anything about programming knows about keywords. Just try and use Visual Basic to create the code in the Public Sub OnStartPage method (Set as as mySc.Application <-- Double as vision there).In addition this same routine attemps to create an instance using the ""as"" keyword instead of ""="". That won't happen. The author of this book must be laughing all the way to the bank. Amazon should hire some real programmers to review these types of books before they waste the readers time and money with this kind of junk."
1,A good book if you're not creating ASP pages.,"I was sorely disappointed with this book. There are too many mistakes in this book, in the source code, the examples, and the diagrams. At times, the instructions given are not complete, and skips steps which I guess he assumes people should know. This makes it very frustrating to get anything done. In addition, the index is not very complete, so it's not easy to find the information you want.I am at the point where I'm going to dump the book and just get the book everyone else I know is getting: Professional Active Server Pages 2.0."
1,A shame to our civilization,"this game depicks people being brutaly murderd by swat teams. I think that this is not just only the most violent game i half ever played, but its full of bugs that have crashed my computer a few times. I recomend that parents keep their kids away from them getting use to killing people."
4,ALMOST perfect,"This Game is Awesome in every way except it only has 5 Mguns 1 Sgun and a few pistols, and the storyline moves toooo quickly but the graphics and stealthy music make up for the minor loss quickly. iF You beat R6, and Eagle Watch (like me) then get Rouge Spear"
2,Too Much Planning -- Not Enough Game Play,This was more boring than fun. It took too much time to plan out the missions. And the actual game play with action did not last very long. I thought this game was pretty boring. If you like to plan out your missions it might be fun. But I prefer going straingt to the action.
4,Heart Stopping Action,"If you are fan of nonstop action, a Tom Clancy Fan, or a Paranoid conspiracy freak this game is for you. I play it all the time and never get bored. If you combine the Rainbow Six, Eagle Watch, and the new Rogue Spear you'll get all the tango shooting action you have dreamed of. Around every corner you turn is a new challenge and a piece of action to keep you excited. This game has enough action to stay excited and also has several real life objectives to make the fun more realistic. Surprisingly enough, Rainbow Six the game follows very closely to Tom Clancy's best seller. Some of the mission and names may have been changed, but all in all the plot is very close that of the book. I loved this game for the action, the suspense, and also just because I'm a bonified Clancy fan."
4,Amazing game only educational in terms of strategy,"If you by one game this is it. I have played no better game before it. James Bond, Goldeneye was my favorite previous to this but it is hard to compare.Not very durable because it's a cd rom game. One of the best features is that you plan out the entire route start to finish for your team to follow, sometimes annoying but plenty of default plans. Endless numbers of modifications and patches for the game which enhance the game play."
4,This game will definately set the standard for future games!,"This game is one of the best out there, if not the best. Single player is great until u try the multiplayer on the internet!! It rocks!! Hundreds of people waiting to get fraged. Or team up on Co-op missions to rescue hostages or disarm bombs. Real to life swat team action. Learn to work as a team!! Join clans ! not hard to find games without Lag . You will definatly love it . This other guys review is understated indubidably!"
4,Definitely the best action expierience I've had in years,Rainbow Six is an an action game which tests your tactical skills in a very realistic. Save hostages and eliminate terrorists as you navigate yourself through a 3D accelerated environment. I would highly recommend it.
5,Amazing Covert Ops game!!!,"Rainbow Six incorporates all the elements of a strategy game coupled with the very best of a first-person shooter. Forget about running around obliterating enemies like quake or unreal. This involves careful planning, with enemies as quick and sharp as you'll hope to be. Die, and your operative is gone for the remainder of the game. Ultra-realistic, there are no fancy over the top weapons, but actual firearms used by special forces such as NATO and the CIA. The missions are nail-biting action all the way, with exotic locations never similar to the others. You have the option of playing it 1st person ala Quake, or a 3rd view perspective from behind, which is awesome. If you've got a graphics accelerater card, the graphics and speed bring you even closer to the action. This game sets the benchmark for all other games in its camp. GET IT"
3,Rainbow Six provides a good mix of action and strategy....,"The first thing you will notice about Rainbow Six is it's graphics. While they are impressive the first time around, it will soon become second nature as you get pulled into the addictive gameplay. Offering a great mix of action, strategy, and espoinage, Rainbow doesn't disappoint. After playing through it and beating it, however, i have to admit it has some major flaws. The frame rate can get really grouchy at times, and the action (which is supposed to be very good), is extremely confusing if you haven't studied youre attack plan. A worthy game, though nothing to write home about."
2,Mold,"This product would have been one step up from the previous generation of Oster steamers if it weren't for one very major flaw.Good Points:-it's inexpensive-the electronic timer works really well (this was the new upgrade from previous models)-it's versatile especially for Asian cooking-it works really fastBad Points:- MOLD the steamer's water inlet, that also serves to help you measure how much water is in the steamer, is a great way to collect mold. Currently it is nearly impossible to dry this inlet completely without pushing a qtip or tissue through, and no turning it upside down doesn't help since the inlet's curves are designed to keep water in - which is really stupid.Oster should spend more time testing their products. This should have been fixed before being released."
4,Gift well received,I gave this steamer as a gift to a friend. She just loves it and uses it 2-3 times a week to steam veggies for the family. She likes the healthy aspect as well as the convienence. So I find this purchase a sucess story.
4,Useful appliance,"We have used this steamer for brown rice, which cooks very satisfactorily, and for ""hard boiled"" eggs, a very nice option, as the eggs don't rattle around and risk cracking. It ought to work well for any other steamed food; the only drawback (though perhaps not everyone would consider it so) is that this appliance by default keeps food warm after cooking. If you don't want to risk something being overdone, you must listen for the ""ding"" and turn the steamer off."
4,"This book is alright , just kinda to basic","Celebrate with Fondant is a little missleading , it's just basic cover cake with fondant , cut strips and shapes and put cut fondant on cakes , repete in diffrent patters and ways , I would have liked to see maybe 2 or 3 pages of thows basics , but the rest i would have love to see how to mold shapes , they did show how to make little ""pebbles"" and a bird but thats about it , I really expected for 11.00 less then something I Figure out on my own , to cover a cake and cut out pretty colors and attach in pretty ways. I expected some more fancy things ... but I got it half price so i'm not complaining , just a warrning that if you know how to put shapes on your fondant covered cake , then you might want to serch for a more complex book ... The lession book for the Wiliton fondant and gumpaste seemed to have more intresting things , flowers , bows , swags , ect , i'm sure i'll still enjoy it ."
5,No better book out there,"Of all the gaming strategy books I have read, the Gamble to Win series has been the most helpful and informative to me. These books take you more into the head of the professional gambler than any other. And now, with Gamble to Win Roulette, the author apparently offers a strategy that reverses the casino's mathematical edge. For my money, there is no better book out there."
1,Fallacious at best,"The author inexplicably overlooks an irrefutable fact - namely, that each and every bet on a roulette wheel has a negative expectation. And that no formulation of negative expectation wagers will attain a positive result - period. And probably the height of fatuity is the authors adice to his readership that his system is best played against an double-zero American wheel, which has a house percentage in excess of 5%, rather that a single-zero European wheel, which has a house percentage of a little over 2%!"
1,Vapid Fluff,"I am not a gambler, but I do enjoy the mathematics of gaming. After reading ""The Eudamonic Pie"" (a non-fiction look at Stanford computer scientists using computers to beat Roulette) I figured this book might provide some insight into playing strategy.Unfortunately, it was a disappointment. There are a few useful tips, but they are wedged between dozens of pages of worthless information. Need to know that chips are made of ""high-impact plastic"" or that you need to show up at the casino with a bankroll? This is your book. If you want to actually develop strategies to beat Vegas, save the $15 and check out any number of good Web sites that dispense gambling advice."
1,"nothing scientific, just words","Any book holding the word ""win"" in its title is a waste, especially for roulette. It simply ignores the mathematical facts. Besides, the approach has nothing scientific: just a personal system that will never work over the long run. Moreover, the author suggest that the house advantage will be waived (another proof of total lack of mathematical knowledge). For understanding how the roulette really works get a book on mathematics of roulette (I recommend Barboianu's book). As for increasing your chances to win, it is better to bet more rather than buy this kind of ""how-to-win"" books."
3,did not help me,"book is written in very interesting way, so you keep reading, it also has some nice examples, teaches caution, but I am not sure if it is practical. well at least with me all this tactic will apply only if your minimal bet per number equal minimal bet per table and bets on red, black or any other groups bet is equal to 5x minimal table bet. And at tables where minimal bet is 25 $ you need to sit at table with about 1500 in your pocket and ready to gamble all those.bottomline, I can not regret the purchase, but I did not win money either. :)"
3,You can win,This book had some legitimate advice for roulette. I would recommend it.I would also recommendbeawinner dot bravehost dot comExcellent advice for roulette
4,pretty complete,"This book shows you all you want to know about colours. It's not truly scientific but it showed me the best and most of colour-theory. I had some trouble with the science-language but hey, I'm Dutch, not a native ""American"" speaker! The only thing that I would change in this book is more pictures, and all in colour!"
3,Great coffee table book,"While I won't go to the trouble of selling this book, I do regret having purchased it. There are many other texts that do a much more nuanced and cogent exposition of the relationship between color and culture. My future use of this book will be as a visual reference, i.e. to refer to the various paintings and other works gorgeously reproduced in color.Otherwise, Gage's Color and Culture as well as Color and Meaning are best used as ""intelligent"" coffee table tomes."
5,Highly useful for experienced developers,"What I really like about this book is that it is cheap compared to its competitors. The author does not waste paper with wordy sentences that is only meant to take up space to create a 1500+ book to justify a price.The author explains three things in depth and better than any books I have ever read (and I have read lot of SQL books): Index optimization, query optimization, and locking.These three topics are usually for advanced SQL developers who must performance tune a complex database. This book is not for the beginners. Having said this, if you want to be a serious database developer, this book will put you ahead of your competition. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to be or is a database developer."
2,"Very good introduction, light on actual tuning","This book contains very clear introductions on how SQL server 2000 works, what are the important design considerations for creating a database, and has tutorials on the various tuning tools. As an introduction on SQL Server workings, it is very good. However, it is also very light on how to actually monitor and tune a real system. The tuning checklist is generic and many of the items are only applicable to designers, not someone who administers databases that may have been in existance for years. If you read the entire book, you can pick out handy items, but it does not give tuning examples, does not tell when to get concerned over particular parameters, nor go into which parameters (from the many supplied by the performance monitor) are really the important ones. As such, I did not find it much help in my daily activities as a DBA. I found ""SQL Server 2000 for Experienced DBAs"" by Brian Knight to be much more helpful."

1,Outdated,"I was very disappointed to find that even though ""2002"" was part of the title, nothing in this book was current. I strongly recommend Taxes for Dummies. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,Lack of depth,"I purchased and read this book. I felt it was too full of generalizations as I was expecting more specific examples. So I next visited the IRS website to read the real stuff. Now the real pain started - I found could read most of the book(excluding the ""Dick & Jane"" examples) on the IRS website FOR FREE!"
2,Not for the average person,This book does not provide what the title indicates. Was very disappointed as I had expected this book would divulge some little known info for tax breaks. Unless you own a business or have tons and tons of money invested I would pass this by.
3,good price for a good book,"good price for a good book, every small business owner, especially on the Internet needs to know this info."
2,Didn't answer the questions I had,"I read this book at Borders Bookstore. While the book is helpful for those who fill out forms and want a general understanding of the new tax codes, it like many books of its type don't deal with the constitutional principles of taxation. Otto Skinner who wrote The Best Kept Secret is the only one I've seen who does this. So, this book is good to a certain extent, but the reader is no where closer to getting beyond the confusion about direct and indirect taxes."
1,Totally amateurish coupled with very poor acting,"This movie is a total waste of time. Very poor and stilted dialogue coupled with laughable acting makes for a stupid viewing experience . You end up not caring one iota about any of the ""characters"". The ""movie"" is simply a vehicle to show a lot of depravity, and a lot of the violence is so superficial that it really isn't believable. I had to rate this movie, so I gave it one star, but it really deserves 0 stars."
2,"Facts about everyday life, very little introspection","I was disappointed in this book, which is full of detail about THINGS but short on information about Amish beliefs and the author's inner life. We learn how many quarts of strawberries were picked on the family farm, but there's nothing about the history and beliefs of the Amish community, or about the author's own spiritual life. I had hoped to read a rich exploration of his values and beliefs, and the inner conflicts and challenges he must have faced when he went ""out into the world"" to go to college and medical school. There is a lot of genealogical detail about the people who were important in the author's life, but they are only thinly characterized. The writing style is very plain."
4,Relaxation time.,Very good book. first with this author for me. It was interesting and will read mopre of his books.
2,Not good for travel,"The collapsible design of these headphones is excellent. Unfortunately, the acoustic design is not up to the same standard. These headphones actually exacerbate the engine noise on some airplanes which defeats the primary use I have for them. I traded headphones with the Bose owner next to me on a flight and the difference in noise reduction was significant and decidely in favor of the Bose model. My son now uses the Sony headphones on the ground but I use Bose headphones for my airline travel."
4,John,"I have used these units for about a year now. They work as one would expect with the noise cancelling being about as good as any in this category. They are light and fold up nicely for easy transport. This is their main adventage over the Bose units. On trips, over three hours, these Sony units can start to get a little uncomfortable on the ears, this, I think, is where the Bose units may excel (not personally confirmed). Given the significant price differential between these and the Bose units the MDRNC20's provide good value while giving the listener a good audio experience."
2,"Good sound, but problems and too expensive","When I first ordered the headphones, I recieved them in the mail and they did not work, the wires or connections were messed up, I could only hear music out of one of the earphones. So I returned in in the mail. They sent me a new pair and the new one worked, it sounded really good. The only complaint, it put a lot of pressure on my ears and it bothered me if I listened to music for longer than an hour. Then after having the headphones for a year, I had the same problem that I had with the first pair. I could only hear music out of one earphone. I take care of my headphones and don't see how this could happen again unless these are not made very well. These are expensive headphones, you expect them to last a long time, but they didn't. Right now I'm trying to find out if I can replace part of the Headphone and see if it works."
3,Not what I'd hoped for.,"I bought these thinking they were the ticket to noise-free, pleasant air travel. They fall short for two reasons. The first is that they just don't cancel that much noise. If you're not listening to music and just compare the difference between having noise cancellation on and off, it's just not that great - partly because of the technology and partly because of the fit. To quantify this, the noise canceling Sony headphones give 10dB of noise reduction whereas the passive David Clark H10-00 headphones for roughly the same price give 24dB just because of the better seal. The second problem is that they generate noise of their own. If it's not that noisy to start with they actually seem to generate a slight buzz. So I'd recommend either getting a pair of earplugs, or a set of headphones with a better seal."
2,Very uncomfortable not worth the Money,I have found that I can not wear this headset for any length of time (30 minutes or more)without it becoming uncomfortable. The sound reduction feature barely works and the music is only fair.You can get better for less.
1,Good... when they aren't broken,"They worked great for a couple of months, but now I can only hear music through one ear and the noise canceling won't even turn on. The warranty isn't good, so I'm out of luck there. If I wanted a paperweight, I would've dug up a rock. These are worthless and a waste of money."
4,Sony MDR NC-20 Headphones,"The headphones were shipped neatly packed with all the attachments.The headphones were used on a recent automobile trip they cancelled the road noise, and made the use of my portable dvd very enjoyable..I would recommend the Sony MDR NC-20 headphones. If there would be any cons I would recommend a volume control on the headset cord. Over all nice serviceable unit."
1,junk,Noise-reduction is useless - in fact I found it made noise worse on a plane. Regular sound quality (e.g. listening to CDs) is ok.Can't believe I paid so much for what I view as a pair of regular headphones...
4,Excellent - A Must Have,"Don't bother buying the Resource Kit - buy this book instead. It explains the architecture and lets you know upfront what is and is not currently available in the 1.0 release of the product.Hacks to provide functionality that should have been in the product are covered (although with strong warnings about no support from Microsoft).If you've suddenly been handed a project involving SharePoint, buy this book! It will save you many hours of grief."
1,Too hard to understand,The book is way too over. I have 5 yrs exp. with 3 in web dev. Still could not make anything out of what the author was trying to convey. The book does not have a practical approach to the usage of the portal.
5,on my top ten list,"Anyone who feels entitled to vote or participate in any way in public policy should be required to read this book. It shows clearly how ""feel-good"" laws with kind intentions can lead to mass deaths of innocent people. Governments during the 20th Century killed 4 to 5 times as many of their own citizens as did criminals, yet governments always try to limit arms possession to only police and military (except perhaps registered ""sporting"" firearms) in order to protect us from criminals. Sadly, so many in the U.S. spend more time watching televised sports or shopping for new clothes than they do reading history, so we march down the same path as so many others. This book at least defines that path, and after reading it, leaves us at our own peril."
3,Kind of slow,This game is good for people who want a relaxing video game. It is a very good video game for children. It seems to be especially appealing to girls.
1,I didn't like the game:believe it or not,"the game's okay, although i don't think making the charactersin 3d was a very good idea, plus at some points game gets outrightboring,and all the main characters smoke... although the game will crash sometimes, and it might get stuck, overall, the game is pretty much okay if you don't count crashes and how the characters act and look... END"
5,Great games,"I had problems with it at first - crashing but then i installed the patch that i downloaded and it worked great. The game did remind me a lot of the Monkey Island series. Although monkey Island i'd say had the best music. Grim had ok music. Game was funny and at the end i wanted more- i finished it too fast (i shouldn't have used those cheats). Really recommended, I wish there was a part II."
3,The other side of the medal,"It is a very good game, and challeging too, but at some points it will get stuck, plus you only get to use keyboard, plus some places are a bit buggy, aside from that, it's a pretty good game, though"
4,Full Auto 2 - Great but not the Best,I like this game a lot; I would have given it 5 stars but you have to play the career mode to unlock more weapons and cars for Aracade and multi-player modes. To me this knocked the game value down since I bought this game for the sole purpose to play against other opponents. So instead of playing each other immediately we are now trying to complete most of career mode to unlock more cars and weapons; to me this is a waste of my time and energy. The game is fun once you have 50% of it unlock and well worth the money; though it would be nice to start off with more than 2 weapons and 3 cars.
5,Fantastic,"Full Auto 2 is an extremely fun car combat game. There are both racing modes and ""gladiator"" modes. In the gladiator mode you drive around a map with the objective to gain the most kills/least deaths. The online play is great, complete with leaderboards. The skill of some of the online players is impressive. The soundtrack is great, graphics look good, the campaign mode has a good storyline, and the variety of cars and weapons is terrific. I highly recommend this game for anyone who owns a PS3."
3,online gladiator mode is great,"I can understand some of the negative reviews. The racing mode is not my favorite. Sometime about the handling does not feel right.However, online gladiator mode is awesome. The destructive environments are cool. I like how you can crash into buildings and objects and see them destroyed.This is a good alternative for people who dont like FPS with blood and gore.The only problem with online, is it can be hard to find some people online"
3,Not certainly was I expected.,"At the beginning the initial cars dont help nothing and are almost useless, and unlocking new ones its a difficult task cause you'll have to spend hours and hours. There is a cheat option menu where you can input several ones, buuuut, just two of them seems to work."
1,SUCKS!,"Ive been waiting forever for Twisted Metal so i was looing for some kind of racing shoot'em up destruction... you know what im saying, but this game bites. No wonder i had never heard of it. Dont waste your time, as im not wasting another minute writing this review."
3,"Okay, I guess",This game could have been a lot better.Racing games where you shoot each other isn't exactly a new idea.Basically this is a boring single player game. You play single player to figure out the abilities of the game and to unlock other cars for multiplayer.Only one problem. Multiplayer online is horrible.This was a rushed launch title. It would be best to forget that it ever came out in the first place.
1,Would rather play the original twisted metal,"I'm not entirely what exactly the game is about, I haven't gotten very far in it because it is so hard to get interested in. Vehicle handeling and far from any other racing game, not in a good way. The destruction tactics aren't all that neat, and graphically is disappointing as a PS3 title. I suggest getting a PSONE and playing the original twisted metal before wasting your money."
3,dont like packaging!,"I got this item as a Christmas gift for my Godsons, so I havent actually played the game, I really hope it works, however, I do not like the pack it came in; plain black case, but again, you get what you pay for, so as long as it works, thats fine by me!!"
1,the game never worked,simply because i never got to play it when i got it piece of the drawing on the game was scratch off this game does not work. what would happen here would i get a new one or would i have to carry this further
2,Don't waste your time,"This game is pretty terrible. It's one of 3 games I purchased along with my PS3 and I played it maybe a total of 6 times.This wasn't due to lack of wanting to play, but because each time I played I'd end up so annoyed and infuriated that I'd put it down for another week.The graphics ARE nice, but there are slowdowns and it just isn't very control friendly. The races are atrociously hard, usually too hard to be fun, and there's rarely anyone worthwhile to play with online.To top it off the game save file would get corrupted pretty often (no I did not turn off the console during HDD access). This is the only game this happens on so I think it's just buggy.Don't waste your money or your time, you won't be able to sell it for more than $20 at your local game store."
3,Full auto 2: battle lines,"I didn't give it much of chance, so don't go my me. I just think it's not very good."
3,Let the good fun roll...online,"I have put about 3 hours into this game including offline and online play. Online play is fun especially gladiator and Cat & Mouse. Destructible environments make the title more ""believable."" If this game were completely online, this game would be 4-5 stars.The offline career mode is the only way to unlock the entire set of weapons and vehicles. There are several cheat codes to help you on your way. 5FINGERDISCOUNT and 10E6CUSTOMER are among them.Now for the reason for the 3/5...You have to unlock the vehicles and weapons in career mode/cheat mode before you can use them online. So when you go online after playing 5 minutes of career mode with your smokescreen and machine guns be prepared to get blown away time and again by the folks (eg. 13 year old kids) with their homing missile and flamethrower.The long and short of it: This game is a good rental or buy if you have a few friends who also have the game."
1,Jinnah's apologist does him disservice.,"As a Pakistani, I was very interested when this book came out and was quite disappointed. Mr. Ahmed quotes mainly from limited and usually controversial sources. Many of these are more recent biographies and commentries rather than historical accounts from the period itself. When he does mention the exact nature of information, his interpretations strain credibility.So my advice is not to bother and read something different, like Wolpert's several books on the subject."
1,It takes on too many things at once and Jinnah gets lost.,"While the author tries to talk about Jinnah, he also tries to talk about South Asia in the same breath. In addition to that, he tries to portray typical stereotypes about how Muslims are ""kicked around on the world stage"" and how Pakistan must accept itself as a ""lesser partner"" in South Asia. He takes on too many things at once in no particular order, and then tries to propogate the innuendo that Jinnah fought against. Is that the way to write about the founder of a nation celebrating its fiftieth anniversary? Certainly not!"
3,Still unconvinced about the need for Pakistan,"An interesting book, no doubt. The author is trying trying to convince us that the odds were stacked up against Pakistan from the beginning, and it never really had a chance. He talks about the ideals of Jinnah - clearly a good man, but was he misguided? I was unconvinced even after reading this book of the real need for Pakistan. There has been such a lot of blood split in both India, Pakistan and Kashmir and for what benefit? I believe tht much of this could have been avoided with a united sub-continent. The author finally outlines some of Pakistan's disasterous history since 1947 - just reinforcing my belief that Jinnah made one big mistake. Daniel Green 16/3/98 ddg@markimp.co.uk"
2,A disappointing finale,The band's reinterpretation of Pictures of an Exhibition is the only track I bother to listen to on a regular basis. The album is a great disappointment compared to Black Moon - which marked their return after an absence from the recording studio as a trio for more than a decade. It's unfortunate that this could very well be the last studio albums we see from one of the best progressive rock bands to come out of England.
5,612 Series Louvered Door Multimedia Cabinet - Solid Oak,This item is simply gorgeous. It came packaged very tightly so that the cabinet could not move inside the packaging. It is truly a fine piece of furniture and we are going to order another one soon as we need one more. I am very impressed with the Leslie Dame furniture. I would recommend this to anyone. All you do is put on the feet and put in the shelves and you are done. We love it!!
4,Serenity,This is an awesome hard metal band. And wow they're from my ancestors land..Finland! They are just as good as Metallica and Megadeth...
4,The unique voice of Finland!!!!,"Definitely, the third solo album from Timo Kotipelto shows that his composition has improved, achieving move beyond the monotony in which fell on some songs from his two previous albums.Stratovarius's voice shines with his ballad and songs like ""Once upon a time"", ""Sleep Well"" and ""Mr. Know-it-all"". This special edition is notable for its beautiful booklet and packaging. It's expensive, but highly recommended!"
2,Don't judge Crais by this effort,"Robert Crais has written several Elvis Cole novels, which I have read and immensely enjoyed. He has always mixed a good measure of humor with the serious elements of his plots and his characters and made it work. Elvis Cole and Joe Pike are the best detective duo since Spenser and Hawk were created. Maybe better. This book is something else altogether. It has a dark plot and even darker characters. The bombers, bombing victims and bomb squad detectives that people this novel are collectively a sad bunch of misfits, cretins, liars and losers. They are all basically unlikable and the distinction between the good guys and the bad guys is blurred. I managed to struggle through Demolition Angel, but if this were the first novel by Robert Crais I doubt that I would ever read another. Fortunately, I know for a fact that Crais is one of the very top fiction writers out there, and I will no-less-eagerly await his next effort."
1,She lit a fresh cigarette,"You could play a drinking game with this book. Slam a shot of gin every time you come across the sentence, ""She lit a fresh cigarette."" That's the one possible way to enjoy this dreary novel.The ""heroine"" is an unlikable lush who smokes like a chimney. Her love interest isn't who he claims to be, and by that I mean he's even duller than he appears at first. The bad guy isn't even interesting.The writing is flat and dull. The plot just plods. I listened to this as a book-on-CD and by the end was wishing someone would detonate a car bomb to put me out of my misery.If you have a few spare hours seriously, go stare at the wall before you pick up this dreadful book. Better yet, go light a fresh cigarette."
1,Woe was me...,"upon completing this book. Unidimensional characters abound in this highly disappointing novel. Had I not read Crais' work before - and enjoyed it greatly - I would have dropped this book mid-read and written it off as an amateurish attempt at a thriller. However, I did complete it and my advice is to save your $."
3,Bring Back Elvis,"Being a big fan of Robert Crais, I really wanted to give the new character of this novel, Carol Starkey, a chance. But I really found myself not caring about her or her problems in the least until things heated up well toward the end of the book. The style of this Crais novel, told in the third person, didn't have the endearing or humorous quality of previous Elvis Cole novels. Good plot here but feels like we're going through the motions to get through the story. Maybe Starkey needs to spend some time with Elvis to lighten up a bit (even Pike's more fun)- or maybe she just needs a cat. Still waiting patiently for the next Elvis Cole adventure."
2,Crais takes a trip to Clicheville,"I will not whine that Elvis Cole and Joe Pike aren't in Robert Crais' latest novel, ""Demolition Angel,"" because I'm sure every writer needs a break from old characters. Plus, it's always interesting when a male writer's main character is female. However, why is it when the protagonist is female she must ALWAYS be attracted to someone who comes into the picture, not to mention grieving over the lover that she worked with who got killed? Crais descends into ""romantic suspense"" territory about a third of the way through ""Demolition Angel"", and the book never recovers. Also, I found it funny that all of the Internet postings and chat described in the book were perfectly spelled and punctuated. Crais obviously has not spent much time on the Internet recently . . . ""Demolition Angel"" is a middling effort by a very good writer. Hey, everyone's entitled to a speed bump, right?"
4,Expanding his reach,"While not up to the level of his last Elvis Cole- Joe Pike adventure, this new creation allows Crais to go where he has not gone before. The best reads seem to be those that teach the reader something new. Crais educates us about bomb makers, their sources and fetishes. A new female lead shows that Crais is not stuck with one character. His focus in the last two books hints that perhaps he is bored with Elvis, but he is never boring."
3,Not his best work,Unlike many of the posts here I did not think that DA was one of Mr. Crais' finest works. I am only half way through the book and so far it is mostly about the lead characters many flaws. I hope the plot starts to pick up. Also unlike the the main posts here I have read every book written by Mr. Crais and I am a huge fan of his other works. I just do not think that his brilliant humorous wit comes through in the lead character. If you like Crais try Harlan Coben.
5,A Shattering Thriller,"If you haven't read Robert Crais you are in for a hair raising ride in the fast lane. Demolition Angel is a pedal-to-the-metal thriller that jolts you from the get-go and dosen't letup until its ahead-on finale. Carol Starkey, an ex-bomb tech, gets reassigned to LAPD's Criminal Conspiracy Section. While battling her inner fears, she embarks on an investigation involving the bomb death of a fellow officer. Caught on an emotional roller coaster, Carol must not only overcome adverse hostillities, but do battle with a demonic mind not seen since Franis Dolarhyde slithered off the pages of Thomas Harris' Red Dragon. Mr. Crais has woven a tale so shocking it will keep you turning pages well into the wee hours of the morning. An unforgettable read."
5,"Great book, beginning to end",This was a great book. I had not read any Robert Crais books prior to reading Demolition Angel. I liked the book well enough to explore other books by Crais and am in the process of reading them now. Great book all the way through.
3,I Just Can't give it 4,"I tried to give this book 4 stars, and couldn't do it. I guess I just don't really care for Carol Starkey. Yes, it's a dark novel, but she's just too tough to be believed!! Even when she does warm up to someone, she doesn't warm up. There's no vulnerability here, and we need that in order to develop a liking for her. Even before I read the author's bio, I knew that this author had written television screenplays. This book reads like a screenplay. It's fast-paced and gritty, but there's little time for plot development, and the ending is rushed. This book just didn't do it for me, although it is exciting enough. I'll wait to see it on television."
4,Impressive,"Although not as good as his last novel LA Requiem, for a standalone thriller this was more than satisfying from Mr Crais.Carol Starkey at times can be a little hard going due to her depressing outlook on just about everything. Having said that, this is more than made up by the truly marvellous character Mr Red, who for me, actually makes the book worth reading. I did enjoy it however and am just about to begin Hostage. If it's as good as this, I'll be more than happy."
2,Shocking decline in the level of Crais' writing,"His last Elvis Cole novel was the best thing Crais has ever written. ""Demolition Angel"" is the worst thing he's ever written. All too obviously it's written in a way to try to sell it to the movies. The characters are very broadly drawn, when they're drawn at all (often supporting characters are the faintest of sketches), and the lead character is so brassy and angry that she's repellent. You WANT her to blow up.The situations are simplistic, the plotting pointlessly tricky, the villain utterly unbelievable. AND Crais thinks Tagamet is merely a powerful antacid. He uses lots of Los Angeles street names without capturing anything remotely like the flavor of the city.The book reads as though it was written in a way carefully calculated to make it a best-seller, and completely without the spirit and sense of involvement that he'd been slowly and competently developing in the Elvis Cole series. This is a disaster."
2,"great author, but","I love this author, with the Elvis/Pike series. But this one about the female dectective they work with, I just could not get into her character, and was ready to borrow a cigarrette just to burn the book!"
3,3 stars is generous,"I read Hostage a few years back and found that to be a TRUE keep-you-awake-all-night compelling read. I finally got around to reading Demolition Angel and figured it would be as good, if not better, based on the premise. Unfortunately it fell far short of my hopes and expectations. Too much of the character development was overly drawn out; at 375 pages, the book perhaps could have been cut down by a good 75 of them by simply not being so thorough in that development. Where Hostage just seemed to flow at a great pace, this one was nearly laborious to get through. Good plot and good characters - but just not enough to rate above 3 stars. Two and a half would be the most accurate rating in my humble world."
3,MR. RED,"A substantial mystery thriller, however with not too much character substance other than the famed Mr. red. He is Obviously the best character in the book. starkey is great but, she is an extreme bore. Mr. red, although not much of an explored character has the most intriguing personality with a strong mentality for destruction. It is apparent that this book is nothing without a great anagonist like him."
3,Full of suspense and action packed.,"This book is easily read, very smooth in style, and full of entertainment.The villain is not described in enough detail, so we are unable to savor the pleasure of hating that character, but Detective Starkey is quite realistic. She is our main character, and she has never gotten over a bomb that killed her LAPD bomb squad partner/lover and nearly killed her as well three years ago. Now she is faced with an inner turmoil, having to face the old trauma and add to it the possiblity of it all happening again. The story wasn't strong enough though, and I think this author could have added more emotion. All in all a good plot, nice characters, and very easy reading."
3,"Mr. Crais, Whither Goest Thou","Another of my favorite authors has fallen under the curse. Like Tom Clancy, Crais gets me hooked with a series of best sellers then decides to change his approach. In his latest book, I struggled thru the first 50 awkward pages strictly out of loyalty to his past works, hoping against hope he would somehow develop this new central character into someone interesting. Then, I gave up and went onto to another book."
2,This book sucks,"I'm a fan of Robert Crais but this book sucks. It's very bad. It drags on and on with an incredibly dissapointing conclusion. Of yeah sure, it's kind of interesting about the bombs, but it was a bad book. This is probably the worst Robert Crais book there is. If you're interested in Robert Crais read the Two Minute Rule."
4,GOOD FOR A FOUR!!!!!,"Starting a new character, Carol Starkey, Crais takes you through the horror of working the bomb squad. Starkey was a bomb squad technican but an explosion that took her partners life and nearly ended hers has gotten her assigned to the Criminal Conspiracy Section. A bomb has gone off killing another technican, Starkey is on the new case. She has two partners, Beth Marzik, who she does not get along with and Jorge Santos, a real good cop. The have to catch the bomber before he strikes again. Special Agent Jack Pell, with the AFT shows up and they are all sure he will take over the case. Pell is sure the bomber is Mr. Red. A man they have been after for a while. The book will hold your attention. You won't want to put it down once you start. Did Mr. Red set the bomb? What about Pell?????? Can Starkey continue to live on gin and tagament and still function well enouth to catch the real bomber?????"
4,"Cool, in a warm sort of way","Robert Crais obviously knows his craft. His descriptions of bomb making and disposal are well researched and the physiological frailties of the characters are intriguing. No one in this book is perfect, which is good, as it's realistic.Carol Starkey bears the pysical and mental scars of a career she desperately wishes to resume with the bomb squad. Currently a detective who smokes and drinks too much for anyone's good, she gets caught up in a case that pulls her through her past experiences and makes her face up to reality. Mr Red becomes an obsession she shares with rogue ATF agent Pell, but at least she finds a balance in that obsession and eventually finds the key clues to breaking the case.This is a compelling story with good characters and excellent technical detail. I thought the last 30 pages got a little cliched for my liking, but will definitely check out some of Mr Crais' earlier work."
4,could have been better,"Unfortunately, Elvis Cole is not in this novel. Instead we get a new character-former demolition expect and cop, who was so traumatized by the explosion three years ago that she can't exist without booze and pills. Give me a break. He goes on about this woman like she is some tough chick. R. Crais must have led a pretty sheltered life. Story itself is not bad if you don't pay attention to the struggles of the main character and don't count the number of pills she is popping."
3,Made to be a movie,"If you're looking for a nice light read that's well-written, this is just the book for you. Just don't expect to be dazzled. It should be no surprise at all that this book is being made into a movie.I will repeat what some other reviewers here have said about the characters. They're not very likable. You go through the entire book, and don't really care much whether the main character lives or dies.If you're new to Robert Crais, I'd strongly suggest that you wait to read this book until you've finished the Elvis Cole series. Go check out 'The Monkey's Raincoat'."
4,Pretty Good Crais Thriller,"Crais can be uneven but I'm happy to report that Demolition Angel is one of his better books. Starkey is a good character, well developed (as a character, that is...)and some of the other characters are well-done also. The suspense of this fast-moving novel is sharp and (fittingly) explosive. My only criticism is that like other Crais books, things get a little bit wacky at the end -- but Crais by no means is the only author guilty of this. I suspect that writers of this genre often do such a good job of creating a complex and riveting plot, that when they get to the end, they don't know how to get out of it. So they kinda go around the bend. But, all in all, this is a good book and, like others have said, you won't be able to put it down."
3,Not your typical Crais,Was basically disappointed in this Robert Crais novel. I am a big Crais fan and thought all his books would be great. But was let down with this one.
2,demolition angel,"Demolish it, for allI care. I can't agree with the majority of the reviewers, who really seem to have enjoyed this book. I don't like Carol one little bit, so I really can't be bothered to find out what happens. Maybe I'm grumpy because I also miss the old Joe and Elvis. Maybe Mr Crais needs a holiday. . . ."
2,For the Completist,"A lot of money for two mixes of one song. All together, the two tracks have a total running time of 5:55. If it were cheaper, I'd give it one more star. The first track is the ""original Abbey Road mix."" The second track is the ""movie mix."" The liner notes say that it was ""produced by George Harrison"" and ""recorded 1967 at Abbey Road studios during the WONDERWALL sessions.""The song features a piano intro that (oddly enough) recalls the Beatles' version of ""Real Love"" on Anthology 2. The song is pretty good. A Procul Harumesque song reminiscent of ""Blue Jay Way."" It features heavily ""phased"" recording throughout. I am a big Beatles fan . . . but I cannot tell for sure whether George is singing background vocals. It might be him . . . but it might not. The Remo Four were a fellow Liverpool band so the accent seems to match George's but I don't know if it's him."
1,Seems to me your book is a copy of someone elses,Its a shame the credit of this book does not go to the right person....I won't buy this book
4,Everyone should start with this!,"Lots of spreads and an index of every card, it even gives you different aspects on reading cards, such as the financial and spiritual.This should be with everyone when they read."
5,A Tarot Spread For Every Need,"This book is great! It has so many Tarot spreads that I can't imagine a situation a person might want to do a divination on that wouldn't be covered by at least one of the spreads in this truly useful book. And since this book is not about any particular deck, you can use it with all your decks.(I have about fifteen different decks.)I especially like the spreads that use lots of cards. They allow you to really explore a question in-depth!I'm speaking from personal experience here. NEVER DOUBT THE ACCURACY OF THE TAROT AND FOLLOW THE ADVICE IT GIVES YOU EVEN IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT!"
5,GREAT BOOK!!! OFFERS MORE THAN JUST SPREADS,I HAVE RECEIVED MY BOOK YESTERDAY AND STARTED READING IT ALREADY. THE BOOK PROVIDES INFORMATION ON THE HISTORY OF THE TAROT AS WELL AS ITS USAGE. IT IS VERY HELPFUL. iT ALSO PROVIDES VERY INSIGHTFUL AND THOROUGH MEANINGS OF EACH OF THE MAJOR AND MINOR ACARNA CARDS. THE FUNNY THING IS THAT IT ACTUALLY PROVIDES MORE INFORMATION THAN THE BOOKS OF THE TAROT DECKS THAT I CURRENTLY HAVE!.LOL. THE SPREADS IN THIS BOOK IS MORE THAN ENOUGH. YOU CAN USE ANY OF ONE OF THEM MORE THAN ONCE. I AM VERY GLAD TO HAVE PURCHASED THIS BOOK!
5,Power tarot: More then 100 Spreads,"I thought it was pretty good. This is for a more advanced tarot user, and not a beginner."
5,A wonderful resource.,"I originaly ordered this book for the spreads. However, when I got it, I found that I was using it more for the information about the different meaning of the cards. I was able to do the financial spread and then look up the financial meanings of the cards."
4,Lots to Review,"There are many, many spreads shown in this book; however, I was expecting to learn of the questions one may ask of their meaning or learn of Why those spreads are used. But, being the ever-curious, I figured I'd let my Intuition lead the way! Great choices, though!"
3,Book With Unfulfilled Potential,"I'm sure this book will be useful to me at some point but I bought it thinking it would be chalk-full of spreads. Instead 2/3 of the book is about the cards and card descriptions. Granted, these descriptions are under categories such as ""Romance,"" ""Work,"" etc. which does help but it's mostly at a beginner level. If I had known how small the spreads section would be I would have bought it used, which is my advice to you. As for the spreads themselves: Quite a lot of them seem like ""fluff"" while a only few are on the useful side."
5,A Memorable Book,"I must have listened to this book 8 months ago, and I'm still impressed with the tension and powerful writing skill displayed by Palmer in this book. I work at a major LA hospital, which made it all the scarier for me. We've had doctors shot by irate patients and live with metal detectors and security at every door and in the middle hall emergency room. Our experience with violence was real, but the terror and violence portrayed in The Patient was certainly realistic, and the medical science revealed in the book seemed believable."
3,"Decent plot, annoying reader.","The Patient has a pretty good plot that will hold your interest, but this reader has a distracting accent and seems to have a minor speech impediment. I don't know why she was chosen to read this, but I will avoid buying anything else she narrates."
2,"A page turner, but....","A good read for the medical suspense genre, but I was somewhat dissapointed by the lack of credibility for the characters. The egomaniacal chief-of-staff; the evil in spades bad guys; the strong but too-sensitive female lead...extremely broad stokes, but, hey, this is not the place for Dickens or Shakespeare.. enjoy the read."
2,Brain-Dead Fiction,"Unless you really, REALLY get into brain surgery as a backdrop for cliched villians, inane dialogue, and the same kind of action done to death by countless other novels, skip this one."
1,lacking in character,The characters lack credibility and substance. Another example of an author substituting technical knowledge in the medical field for good writing.
4,4 1/2 stars. Great read,Must go along with the consensus in that this is Michael Palmer's best book to date. This fast paced novel grabs you by the greens and straps you to the gurney. A well researched story line combined with realistic characters makes for a very enjoyable read. I particularly liked Alex's odd snacking habit...Highly recommended
4,A solid medical thriller,"I was new to Michael Palmer as an author when I picked this book up but he did not disappoint. The medical descriptions and dialog are real as they can get without bogging down to much in the details and the character development is excellent. The plot is a bit contrived but still believable. Having a notorious criminal getting an operation to change his appearance is one thing, but to have a known world terrorist operated on for a brain tumor and the lengths he goes to have the delicate surgery was a fresh take on the subject. I could easily see this being made into a movie as it moved along at a good clip, kept you guessing along the way and had a character you'd love to hate (the chief of surgery). The book has several subplots which kept your interest throughout and moved the story along. All in alll a very good read. I'll definitely be reading more of Michael Palmer's books in the future."
5,An Exciting Read,"This is a highly plausible medical thriller,well paced with a few unexpected twists and turns.Perfect for reading in the Southern Hemisphere in front of a warm fire.Good vacation read in that other remote hemisphere"
3,Written with the big screen in mind.,"I am not a fan of this type of literature-- books that are written as if they were adventure films. Since I don't like the entire genre much, I may not be the best judge of the merits of this one. If you want non-stop action and depth of characterization is not a priority then this is a book you will enjoy. Even for a straight forward adventure romp, I found the story to be contrived. Would even an international terrorist want his surgeon to feel at risk for her life while she's performing delicate brain surgery? Shaking hands come to mind. I got about 3/4 of the way through, well into the climax of the novel and I realized I didn't care what happened. I have read adventure novels that, while they din't rank on my top 10, did propel me through to the end. This one didn't."
4,"Great Suspense, Nice to Get into Intelligent Characters","A real relief to read suspense that is not just about the action and exposions. No sex, no sexy women, no smoking guns. Just intelligent people stuck in a suspenseful situation and dealing with it as real people. And an author who doesn't assume all his readers are stupid and will not understand. I will read more from this author, cannot wait."
1,ANOTHER,'Nurse/Doctor Jane goes to Hawaii' book. My first Michael Palmer book and my last. I didn't finish the book because I don't really care who wins or loses.
5,Michael Palmer scores another medical thriller!,"A feisty neurosurgeon, a rogue CIA agent, a Carlos-like terrorist, brain tumor patients, an unbearable surgeon, and a robot device named ARTIE are the stars of Michael Palmer's latest thriller -- his best in years. We're drawn into the dangerous world of cheap death, the horror of brain surgery (what can go wrong usually does go wrong in this novel), and into a wonderful main character's life, Dr. Jessie Copeland. The surgery scenes crackle. This book kept me up until two A.M. It's that good, folks!"
5,But Ya Gotta Be Patient...,"Slow start - great middle and good ending. A nice page-turner that, when you're done, you wish you could pick up another and keep going. The characters are believable; the plot plausible. This was my first read of a Palmer novel, and I can tell you I will be seeking out his others to catch up on this excellent story teller's works. Buy it now!"
4,Another great Medical Thriller!,The Patient is another great one from Michael Palmer! His characters are well thought out and must be cloned from some of the people I work with! I guess I wanted a little more sappy love from the neurosurgeon and CIA agent...so I gave it 4 stars...but it was worth my time!!!
4,Rx: A Better Recording,"I see some fellow reviewers of the audio cd version registering complaints about the production quality and the performance of the female reader. I prescribe the unabridged cassette version from Recorded Books. Reader Paul Hecht delivers a virtuoso performance - the giveaway being that his interpretation of the female characters, the key players in this story, are all completely believable. And a variety of accents are handled convincingly; listen how subtly Hecht meets the challenge of one character that he, reading as narrator, describes as having a ""hint of an Irish brogue"".A long recording at eight cassettes, I was still interested enough to listen to the 9th which was a recorded interview with doctor/author Michael Palmer. For the readers who had a problem with the ending, it was interesting to note that Palmer says the denouement is the one part he doesn't plan in advance; he lets it flows naturally from the characters."
1,Dangerous Shoot From the Hip Methodologies,"The methodologies advocated in this book are for managers who don't mind shooting from the hip and living dangerously. This can be the only fair assessment as the author does not cite a single reference (although there are many authors in this field and the domain is not new), the methodologies are developed based on what I call ""farmer math"", and the supporting logic for the methodologies is fraught with logical errors, fallacies and oversimplifying assumptions. This book was written for clients as a marketing tool, was not peer reviewed by people knowledgeable in the field, and was printed by an unreputable publisher (visit their website at [...] and you'll find a website selling storage sheds!).There are many books out there that are clearly written and have methodologies that won't get you into trouble. You've been warned."
5,For savvy teenagers,"Who needs another health guide for girls done in pink and white - or one that tells young women what adults THINK they need to know? ""It's About Time"" is straight talk from ten urban teens. It's readable and packed with personal stories and useful information."
5,Starcraft,This what makes ppl so crazy for the new game Starcraft II (wings of liberty).Starcraft is the best game ever. i love it soo much
3,Freddy Fever!,"I kind of thought the NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET the series was cheesy, but as a fan of Freddy, I still liked these episodes."
4,What happens when scientists get greedy with their projects,"This book describes the activities of a group of scientists involved in microbiological research aboard the Enterprise. What's intriguing is a murder mystery with several elements: another Betazoid aboard the Enterprise besides Troi; a disagreement about a scientific discovery that the Betazoid wants to sell to a higher bidder;an angry young woman seeking revenge; a revisitation from the Kreel (from ""Strike Zone""); murder and a trial with Worf as a prosecutor. In short, a nice novel you can absorb on a plane to California. Here's a neat tie-in to another STTNG novel: If readers wonder about why the transporter complained of infection in ""The Last Stand,"" the answer is that the transporter was fitted with the biofilter that was invented by a ""Contamination"" character!"
3,Kindle version is a travesty.,"I am shocked at the poor quality of the ebook version of this story. Punctuation is completely missing except for periods at end of sentences. Spaces between words are nonexistent many times per page. It's seems to have been typed by a novice and edited by a five year old. I love the old STNG books and was excited to add a few to my Kindle, but trying to enjoy the story is very difficult with the distraction of an unreadable text. BUYER BEWARE. The publisher should be refunding all $ spent on this!"
1,Bad formatting and bad customer support,"Let me start by saying that the story itself is great. I'd give 5 stars on the story and the paperback version.The problem is the Kindle edition. DO NOT BUY IT for Kindle!!!!! It is missing all parentheses around character dialog. It's completely unreadable. I've wasted 2-3 hours already with support with no resolution. I get emails that it's fixed, but nope, it's not fixed yet. All support wants to do is give me a refund and pushing me aside. Very poor showing on Amazon's side."
4,Could there be love in the air.,"Counselor Troi and Lt. Worf working together? Sure they do it everyday, but not like this. This alone could have set the stage for their relationship in All Good Things. Talk about things that make you go Hmm"
5,Descent,"Peter Telep, I believe, is a great writer. I've read this book several times over, and have been equally impressed each time. Each time I climbed into the cockpit of the Pyro GX in the book, it made me want to load up my copy of Descent and play the game like it was in the book. A great novel all around. You won't get bored with this one. I am currently reading Stealing Thunder now, the sequel to Descent. I recommend getting all three novels in the series, Descent, Stealing Thunder, and Equinox. You won't be disapointed."
4,"stunning,I felt like I was flying down those tunnels","Good book,A must read for any sci fi fan I myself being a marine and reading about marines of the future really gripped me.I cannot wait for the next book.I am a big computer gamer and this book really brought substance to the game that I had so enjoyed,so much that I loaded it back up on my computer and played it again.Thanks peter keep up the good work Sgt adams USMC"
5,DESCENT IS OUTSTANDING !,Having played Descent when it first came out in 95 I felt that noone could do a book. But I was wrong. Author Peter Telep has made a great game into a great book. From the begining of the first chapter to the last chapter. I could not put the book down. Back to playing Descent.
5,Fantastic,"I loved this book. I could not put it down once I started, and I took 4 hours out of my Sunday to read the last 150 pages. The strong points overrode the weaker points. I would have loved to see the breifing scene from the game, and would have liked more action, and thought it would have been cool to have more chapters from that Supervisor droid's perspective. (Like, chill dude!) But, the conflict between Dravis and Ornowski was great. Keep up the good work."
4,Best Sci-Fi Action I've read in a long time,"Telep's ""Descent"" combines great adventure with explosive action and believable characters. The multidimensional plot within the characters made this book a constant page-turner. If it wasn't for school, I'd have read it in a day!The only reason it got a 4 was because it needed some slightly better editing."
5,Hell Of A Book! Welcome to Descent.. Prepare for the Worst!,"-Strap those Shakers into your pyro, load that Gauss cannon! PREPARE FOR DESCENT!-Descent is one of the BEST books I have ever read. Being an addicted Descent player and having a site about Descent, I felt compelled to read it as soon as I heard it existed! Its really detailed, and gives me a new feel for the Descent world, now when I play the game, I always sorta think of it as a story :)I read it in 3 days, and cant wait for Stealing Thunder!!Even if you havnt ever played the game, its so descriptive that you wont miss a thing!I recommend this book to any serious Descenter or someone just looking to read a GREAT Sci-Fi Book!Amazing Book, Congrats and Thanks, Peter![PTMC Transmition Ended] {TySoft OUT}"
5,"Very well writin action packed,",REALL REALLY REALY GREAT! Action packed and not just blood and guts. Good story. Can't wait for Stealing Thunder!
5,Awesome...,Definately one of the most interesting and entertaining books I've read. Mr. Telep took a good story and turned it into a great story. If you've played the game you will love it. If you haven't played the game you'll still love it. I had never read a book that was based on a video game that wasn't real bad... until this one. This guy has some serious story telling talent. And I'll snatch up the next book in the series as soon as it's released. Great Job!
1,waste of time,"This book seems like it was written by a fifth grader. Like , the bad boy marine rolled his fighter over and was getting ready to fire his rocket!. ...Or... , Am gonna haft to kick butt now. Because hey , it's what I do.. This book is so poorly written that I found it to be a waste of time and money. Way too much money infact.. Buy it for your kid in grammar school , maybe they may like it."
4,They Gobble It Up,"I switched to this product recently. I have a large Tin Foil Barb, Bala Shark, and Silver Dollars which really go for this stuff. My only issue is it sinks very rapidly so they end up getting most of it off the tank floor. I had been using a similar product from Top Fin, but they prefer this."
2,terrible product.,"So i bought this for my dojo loach,pleco and cory catfish and only the loach likes it.The problem is,its very messy.The second you place it in its already disintegrating.It takes under 1min until the food becomes uneatable and is all mushed up in my gravel.And my loach isnt a very smart creature and it takes time to find the pellet."
2,"Fish like it, but too messy","The ingredients are good, the price is fine, and the fish like it. The problem is they are much too messy. The pellet floats for 3 seconds and then sinks rapidly. It then expands within 10 seconds and begins to fall apart. And with shrimp pulling at it, and tetras ripping at it, it COMPLETELY falls apart into dust, which then gets kicked up into the water, falls through the gravel..... ewww. Then I have to go in with the turkey baster and suck it up. It's too much hassle to just feed the fish. There are better options, I like the hikari sinking food."
5,Fish love these pellets,"I initially bought these pellets for my pleco, but soon found that all my fish favor this food the most. I had bala sharks, angel fish, tiger barbs, a blue gourami, a pleco, and an occassional beta. They all went for these pellets first. Only the frozen bait cubes are favored over these pellets.After a water heater malfunction, that boiled all my fish (arrrghhh), I began again with african cichlids. Initially the cichlids went for the cichlid pellets. As they grew, they now eat the shrimp pellets first, and then the cichlid food.I would highly recommend these pellets for most community tanks, plecos, or african cichlids."
1,Ingredient list is incorrect.,The first ingredient in these pellets is wheat!!! I'm looking at the package right now. WHEAT???? These are supposed to be SHRIMP pellets not wheat pellets. Might as well throw a hotdog bun in the tank. My fish won't touch them.
4,Good product but don't buy it at Ozbo's...,"I find that near the end of using this product, there is an awful lot of powder left over that would probably pollute you aquarium water. Ozbo sent me product with a best by date one month prior to receiving it! I don't want old product that has sat in some warehouse for several years and passed off as 'acceptable'. I sent it back unopened immediately and bought some HBH shrimp pellets instead using Amazon Prime. Much better outcome. Steer clear of Ozbo if you can!"
5,My Platinum Blue Angel Loves It,"My angelfish, Goldman, is not as swift at his tankmates when it comes to getting to the food I put in their aquarium.So I give him a few of these shrimp pellets each day, which he really enjoys.The rest of the fish enjoy them as well, including my Panda Corys."
4,bottom feeders love it,Great for hungary bottom feeders!! The upside down catfish really thinks it is great. It came in a short period of time.
5,Fish Like it,A tank full of loaches and catfish really prefer this over the product specifically designed for them. I will buy another.
2,very slow,"I found this book to move very slowly. In fact, I had lost interest in the book about 1/4 of the way into it, and I had to force myself to read the rest of it. The only character I thought was interesting was Monty...the dog."
2,Must love dogs and cheesy romance,"Do you like romance novels? Do you call your dogs your babies? This is the book for you. The thriller aspect of this book is far overshadowed by the romance portion, and the annoyingly repetitious mentioning of the dog could possibly drive most readers over the edge. This was my first Johansen novel, and it most certainly will be my last. Two stars for actually wrapping up the story without leaving too many loose ends."
5,Love Moves On,"John Logan, billionaire and once lover of Eve Duncan. What happened to him after Eve chose to make a life with Joe Quinn? We liked him.And then there was Sarah and Monty, her dog. They too played a part in Eve's life. What happened to her?Find out the answers in The Search."
3,The Search,"I enjoyed Iris Johansen's book The Search, very much. The story is gripping though sometimes a little far-fetched, but her characters Sara and her dog Monty are excellent. A problem I found in the book, though, was in the beginning there was an earthquake in Turkey and Ms Johansen had a young Turkish girl clasping a cross necklace she was wearing around her neck. Turkey is an Islamic nation, and the percentage of Christians who live there is very small, and they live almost exclusively in the two major cities. She may have left many people with a very false impression. A little research would have saved her from this mistake and the sort of unsettled feeling it gave me for the rest of the book."
2,This a romance novel thinly disguised as a thriller,"I bought this book expecting a thriller with good action. What i got was a romance novel centered around a search dog with an IQ that would rival Einstein (now I've used a dog or two in my books, but never to this extent). Anyway, if you want a romance novel with a lot of unrealistic action and improbable situations, this is the book for you."
2,the scary search,"My title is ""The Scary Search."" My author is Iris Johansen. The important character is Maggie. The genre of this book is mystery. It's about Maggie and her dog searching for a little girl, and it takes two days to find this girl. The little girl was playing at school and somebody snatched her from her school. She's thirteen years old and has two sisters and two brothers. Maggie said, ""The guy that took her, I think he wants to deal with the police for money."" The guy said, ""I want to make a trade for one million dollars tomorrow at six o'clock at her school."" I really don't like the book because it's really boring and I'm not interested in it. There's two hundered and ninety eight pages in this book. It's very easy, that's why I didn't like the book. I do not recommend it because I don't like the book. ""The Search"" was a horrible book."
5,Loved It,This book had me reading into the night. Johnasen always is a name to rely on for an exciting read. I have read all of her books and as usual I can't wait for the next one. Johnasen always brings a little something to the table for the reader that is hungry for adventure and thrills. I would recommend this or any of her books for a satisfying read.
4,Nicely Done,"I enjoyed this book. Being an animal lover, I surely related to the bond that Sarah and Monty had together. I also related very much to her independent character and ""set in her ways"" point of view. Her need to help people no matter what was admirable and believable. Just look at the people from Sept. 11th. The fact that she became involved with Logan is totally understandable. The story keeps you guessing and I like the way it was pulled together toward the end. The villian, Rudzak, could have been just a bit stronger in my opinion. All in all, I truly enjoyed this book. I will ""search"" out more of her books in the very near future."
2,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed in this novel. I was expecting a murder mystery thriller. Instead, I got a porely written novel which suddenly turns into a romance novel in the middle of the mystery portion. So, if your looking for a good mystery novel try another book."
3,"High on Romance, Low on Mystery","Maybe I should have started with the Killing Game, but I didn't. When I saw the marketing line, ""If you like Patricia Cornwell, then you will love Iris Johansen..."" I thought...great! After reading this book though, I have to say that it is more like a ""fair"" Catherine Coulter book than a Patricia Cornwell. It is a fast read (I am one of those people who never not finish a book), but a little too much on the schmaltzy romance (does anyone fall in love this fast?) and not much on the suspense. I probably will try the Killing Game, just because I want to give her a second try."
3,Thriller to romance?,"This was my first Johansen book, and in the beginning I was pleased with it -- strong female character able to fend for herself, the interesting S&R sideline, difficult locations, dealing with the tough emotions of death from disaster. And then, out of the blue, it became a romance novel. The rich guy had to save her, she's no longer her own person, it's all about the guy's first wife, he's dragging her everywhere against her will -- to me, it was a total let-down. I kept hoping the wolf would chew off Logan's foot or something and Sarah would rediscover herself, but alas, they're getting married and she'll be a billionaire and never have to break a fingernail again rescuing orphans out of mudslides. Blech!"
5,love iris,I always get such pleasure from reading Johansen's books and was not disappointed this time. If you are a fan of hers or not it is one book you should read.
2,authors should either know their topic or research carefully,"Its obvious that the author knows very little about Columbian forests or gunfights or poker or dogs. This book might charm readers who enjoy romances and who have never been in a jungle, never played poker, never gave thought to the way battles are actually fought and have no experience working with dogs. I normally enjoy books about dogs, but I made the mistake of reading The Search immediately after reading one of Susan Conant's mysteries. Susan Conant's dogs have personality and seem real. The dog in The Search never seems real."
1,"flat dialog, and unpleasant ""hero""","I quit this book 50 pages in-here's why:I'm a regular reader of romantic suspense-this book doesn't even get into the story until 40 pages in (and it's only 311 pages). It just doesn't grab you. The story-the heroine being forced into a search mission by the hero-an unscrupulous businessman-uninteresting, and not inducable to wanting to continue the story.The hero is your typical hero for some romances-tough, self made millionaire-but this guy is a user, and will use any means necessary to get what he wants-not a high recomendation for a romantic hero.the heroine is bland and one dimensionable-and that's saying something for a modern heroine that is a search dog rescuer for the ATF! Her ""psychic"" connection is a bit far fetched the way it's written.The biggest miss was the dialog-flat and dull. The interplay is very repetitive and simplistic.1 star and hopefully another Johanson will be better."
5,Just as good as the rest!,"I was so excited to see that the story of Logan/Sarah/Monty/Eve/Joe/Bonnie etc. had been continued!Just like the previous books about this group, The Search is definately a page-turner! The character building is lessened in this ""episode"" because we've had two books to get to know everyone; so it leaves room for Ms. Johansen to tell the story...and what a story it is! What I enjoyed most of all was finding out the history behind John Logan which helped explain some of his actions/thoughts from The Face of Deception and The Killing Game.I would be absolutely thrilled to see more about this group hit the shelves!"
5,WONDERFUL!,Loved this book and love the character of Sarah. The relationship between dog and owner is amazing while they go on this search. Great book and great author!
3,good but not great,"i love iris johansens books - and the characters. i quite enjoyed this book but found it short and lacking some of the depth of her other books. still, worth reading !"
1,feminist propaganda,"Give me a break. I can't believe this book has gotten such positive reviews--well its a free country! From the beginning, the book seems to be uninspired. A woman and her dog (a very smart and sensitive dog) are forced into a search--in the Colombian jungles-- for the kidnapped employee of a billionaire buisnessman. Now, just think with me for a moment. If I were a billionaire would I be so all fired ready to force a woman and her dog to find my kidnapped employee? I don't think so. I think if I were a billionaire who wanted to find someone in the jungles of Colombia, I would hire an ex-navy seal or army ranger to do the job. But of course, in our times, feminism finds many outlets in fantasy and illusion (such as THE SEARCH) because in the real world, women are not sent into jungles with a dog to find a kidnapped employee. Instead, good old fashioned rugged men are sent into that kind of situation."
3,The Search,"I really enjoyed reading the book ""The Search"" by Iris Johansen. I think that it is a well written book. The vocabulary is very well used and not hard to understand. I think that Iris Johansend did a very good job writing this book. It is interesting and sometimes suspenseful. It keeps you wanting to read on."
3,Disappointing,"I have read three of Iris Johanansen's books which I thought were pretty good. The Search, however was very disappointing to me. It seemed to drag on so slowly especially in the beginning. Although there were several interesting plot twists, I still felt the overall book failed to keep my interest."
5,Xenia makes me believe!,amazing album from start to finish. Xenia is a real life doll! with her haunting sweet voice & little girl lolita style she sends shivers up my spine! did you know she has her own fashion line too? check out limecrime.net to see her amazing creations.BUY THIS ALBUM! it will make you believe too!
2,Only Get if you already have understanding of Tomcat,"This book is mainly a list of params and file structures. It is only for someone that already has admin earlier version of tomcat. If you are looking for a book that will teach you how to admin tomcat 5+ and have never used tomcat or setup tomcat then this is not a good book for you.I would only recommend this book for a review if you are already a tomcat admin with some experience, else find another book that shows examples and explains tomcat in a more logical manner.This is another example of a book written by a techy that knows the product but should never publish a book."
5,Caffeinated introduction to Jakarta,This is a rocket ride of code and configuration to get you right through a walkthrough of Jakarta from soup to nuts. There is little exposition and the work is fairly short. If you know what you are doing and you are looking for a complete walkthrough then this is your book. If you are looking for a reference then this is not it.
3,Brown and the feministic view,"The content of this book is useful in a research aspect. I have used it for a British Literature class the focused on Restoration Literature. Brown's feminist views on Swift's writings seem a little obsurd, but she does do a superb job representing the main feminist perpectives on the literature she criticizes."
1,Only for weird taste guys,"Although the game technologies used in half life might be good, this game requires weird taste to enjoy. Too much violence, and full of ugly, disgusting things. I had only uncomfortable experience from half life.This game is a typical example of technically biased game but totally lack of sense of beauty. The reputation seems to come from game industry that wants to simply sell it."
4,The ending sucks!,"This game is THE BEST PC GAME EVER, bar-none. Awesome story, great graphics, etc.... Sorry, though, the ending is very disappointing. From Xen on, the story turns stupid. It's like pitching a brilliant perfect game for 8 1/3 innings, then cheesin' out to the number 8 and 9 hole hitters and giving up homers on 0-2 fat fastballs down the gut... Still, the previous 12 or so levels make up for it. AWESOME!"
4,"The game is best of this year, it realy shows hard work.","This game will leave you on the tip of your seat for hours and still for many more hours.It has real thinking enemies horrifying monstrosities and exccelnt graphics, and thats just for first player mode. The game has easy multiplayer acces to internet or network play.Just a few click and your shooting.It really does deserve the GAME OF THE AWARD 1999!!!"
4,Good for gameplay for a long time,"This game is, without a doubt, one of the best on the market today. Not only does it set the standerd for one-player gameplay, but it also provides much multiplayer fun as well. It does so not only with main-game multiplayer action, but ""Team Fortress Classic"", included with the game, my personal reason for buying several copies for me and my friends. This is a game played over the internet with many other people, allowing features, weapons, and fun galore for he who seeks it. So work extra jobs or pawn jewelry to buy this game, you won't be sorry."
5,Great game!,"This game has taken FPS to the next level. If you liked Resident Evil, you'll love this game. There are a lot of similarities but Half Life's atmosphere and realism are a little better than RE's. In summary, it's a fantastic game."
3,I don't know about this one.................................,"I love unreal series but, when I played half-life....well....I guess it just has no adventure to it I mean the graphics are just okay....same goes for sounds, music cool....gameplay boring............pckeybpard controls comfortable, but I think this game is just okay...........not worth it to me, I ran it on my new state-of-the-art-dell computer, I'm not sure about this one, but I haven't beat it yet, so when I get farther into the game, I'll add-on to the review!"
4,"Looks good, but be prepared for headaches running it.","Many people are having trouble running the game, specifically those like myself with the Diamond Monster 3d voodoo video cards. In addition, the game when launched seems to think that I want my internet connection window opened, so it does it for me, and will crash the whole works if I do not close the connection window before going further with the game. This takes a little doing, since the window is not visible behind the game screen. I think the developers could have done better."
2,Not enough information,I recently order this video and am very disappointed. I am a beginner and the video doesn't seem to cover enough information to make me confident in finishing concrete. There is very little detailed information. James Beville appears to be working at a job site and just explaining what he is doing to someone who happen to be videotapping it(not very professional video editing). There is no information on how to avoid problems such as scalling or cracking. The video is about 30 minutes long making it about a dollar a minute. I found more information for free on the net or spend your money on a good masonry book which will probably be less.
2,Too Brief ...His way the only way,"For someone with no knowledge this video would be of some help. However, he shows no use of reinforcement in the driveway paving. Depending on your location (southern USA) you might not need it but here in Ohio it is critical. He makes no mention of stone as an underlayment which in areas with severve cold helps to prevent one area of the ""slab"" from raising above the surrounding pieces. Unfortunantly, I have not found any videos which are as comprehensive as this one. (Which isn't very good) In conclusion, if you're from a warm climate, this will serve you well."
5,Dog shampoo,My wife has been wonderfully pleased with this product. It leaves her cockapoo soft and shiny. She says that it the best she has ever used.
1,A Waste of Money,"This DVD is produced in a very amateur way, and anyone who has even a basic knowledge of word processing already has the ability to do all he covers. The only piece you may not have is the third part, which tells about the UPS program to upload, print and mail your newsletter. This single piece of information is certainly not worth the cost of the product."
1,Grand Scam,"this book is a very tiny book and not the full size two hundred and some pages real book, it is selling for ten times the suggested retail price and seller plays games with you when you attempt to return it for a full refund,"
3,Small bok of classic french cuisine,A very Small but important book for its insite into a historic kitchen. Recipes are detailed and useful to the experienced cook.
1,Cooking w/Soul for Gastric Bypass Patients,"Most of the recipes are not original recipes. I am a great cook and have seen and used the recipes before. Most of the recipes are not for weight loss patiens, too high in fat and sugar.Lewis Bernard"
5,Good Cookbook!,I've only tried a few of the recipes but the recipes that I tried are easy to prepare and very tasty. I am planning on trying more of the recipes in the future.
1,Shipping & handling charges are retarded!!!,"Be careful!If you buy more than one of this product, they charge you $4.99 shipping and handling for every single one separately.The product is supposedly $1.10. But if you need 10 of these, they charge you $49.90 shipping & handling. Oh, by the way, all 10 will come in the same box, because all 10 show under the same shipment at checkout. But they will still charge you $49.90 for shipping and handling.At first, I couldn't decide whether this was plain ""retarded"" or whether it was another invention of a marketing genius to milk customers. Since it is on Amazon, I will go with ""retarded"" for now.If the 10 pieces come in 10 separate boxes, it is even more retarded!!!"
1,Did not fit the socket,This adapter did not fit the electrical socket - plastic on the edges prevented the adapter from plugging into the socket.
5,meditative and minimalist,"In a world where shiny art and shiny costumes are the norm, its a refreshing change of pace to find a graphic novel like this. A quick read, this is a wonderfully heartfelt story of untraditional love and human relationships. I hesitate to call it a 'coming-of-age story' because that would seem to denigrate just how beautiful this story really is. The characters are real and the minimalist brush lines are expertly placed to convey the perfect emotions without the clutter of unnecessary crosshatching or gawdy computer coloring. I read Big Clay Pot and find myself relaxing from the sometimes overwhelming chaos of daily life. Easliy one of the best things I've read in a while."
3,"Nice design, beautiful and easy to assemble","Assembled easily if you have basic plumbing skills. Nice, solid design. My only issue is the water pressure did not live up to explanation. I drilled out the water flow inhibitors and it is a bit better but still not strong enough."
3,"Some filler, some killer","The way this novel started out, I figured I'd be on a reading binge comparable to a Switters peyote trip. I was hooked by the crazy characters and mesmerized by the build-up and eventual journey into the Amazon. Unfortunately, that turned out to be the peak of my buzz. The Pike Street Market art girls scenes dragged on a bit too much, and that was tame in comparison to the laborious stretch of time in the Syrian nun convent.However, I'll never abandon a Robbins novel because his prose is always too engaging. Despite losing a pulse-pounding plot, Robbins can always entertain with his creative metaphors and stunning imagery.I'm sure I'll pick up the next Robbins novel. I just hope he finds some substance to help liven the pace."
4,Four stars only by comparison,"I have gobbled up, drunk in grand gulps and even sucked deliriously on the words with which Tom Robbins graces our world. Fierce Invalids... being the latest journey Mr. Robbins describes was certainly not lacking in dilectible bits of yummy prose. Do not be dissuaded by Mr. Robbins' change in style (similar to Half Asleep in Frog's Pajamas) he explores a character in Fierce Invalids... that demands, rather undemandingly, to be learned from and loved. Switter's message is timely and any lover of Tom Robbins should enjoy this bumpy, technicolor ride. I give this book only four stars, not because it is in any way an inferior work as works of fiction go, simply because Jitterbug Perfume is still holding the five star spot in my heart. Thrill me again Mr. Robbins, I'll be reading."
1,Attention English Teachers,"Save yourself time and money. Read the summary above for the so-called story. Switters is an uninteresting, alcoholic pedophile with a fascination for run-on sentences and strings of useless adverbs and adjectives. A high school English teacher will recognize the style, (or lack of it). Imagine a 5,000 word essay assignment. The child is stuck at 4,000. He then uses the built in Thesaurus on his word processor, and strings as many adverbs and adjectives together to get to 5,000. This tedious story rambles along with a character we don't care about doing things that are so contrived that only a drugged out dullard would consider. This book was a true waste of time."
2,Even Tom Robbins gets the blues,"I have read all his books. So, I was keen on reading this one too and I bought the book.But, this book neither sparks my imagination nor excites me with robbins touch. I had to struggle to read. Ultimately, I have given up. I don't know for sure whether I don't understand the book or this book is not his best."
2,ah well,Maybe Mr Robbin's Guru status has gone to his head...or Im just older....who knows...the edge seems to be gone in this one....nonetheless. I have enjoyed his writing in the past...and as for Switters...gee. He seemed like such a shmuck...but maybe he was supposed to be a shmuck...who knows......I wish I would have bought it in paperback.....
3,A Verbal Ramble,"Our fierce invalid has stirred interesting ideas with wonderful metaphors into a goulash that overflows its dish. Tighter editting would have made for brighter, more continuous, reading, and about 150 fewer pages."
4,Beauty to the Beholder,"So some die-hard T.R. fans find this book pedestrian, maybe they should get out more. It's definitely worth a read. Sure, the books ""insights"" and ""parables"" don't cause the reader to pause and wonder...""hmmm, could that really be true?""...like some other T.R. works. But, the clever reparté, witty metaphor, nearly 3-dimensional characters, and tightly-packed narrative are worth the ticket price into Mr. Robbin's Neighborhood."
4,Suzy is Hot,"This book starts off great, but doesn't get any better. Switter's journey in South America is engaging and hilarious. When he comes home and wants to bang Suzy, that's entertaining as hell too. But then the book loses steam. By the time he's in the convent, the book kind of drags. But this book is worth reading nonetheless. It's steeped in humor, philosophy and adventure. I highly recommend it."
2,Diluted prose,"This book was my introduction to Tom Robbins, and it left me unsatisfied. It seemed to me that he attempted to advance the story (and his philosophizing) by throwing images and similes at the reader, and hoping some stuck. The result is frustrating -- Switters is a tedious travel companion who talks too much and says too little, and descriptions that fail to resonate at first (""too damn vivid"", ""fierce, hypnotic green eyes"") do no better when repeated. Don't take Pynchon's praise too seriously; ""Fierce Invalids"" lacks the intensity, depth, and humor that ""Gravity's Rainbow"" achieves."
2,What a waste of creative genius,"He may have a gift for gab and the eloquence of his pen is amazing but, really now, the subject matter is a complete turn-off. When he got to the anal sex with a nun, I had to wonder just why I was reading such trash. Too bad he couldn't clean it up because the gratuitous filth added nothing to the story."
2,Could have been so much better,"I have read a few of Tom's books, loving Jitterbug Perfume the most, and this one the least. Had a few moments, but not as great a work by a long shot. Only for die-hards, unless you've got a lot of time on your hands. Read his other books first, and this one only if youmust."
2,Yawn...,"I owe this, my one and only Tom Robbins experience, to a monthly book club. I'll admit it -- I didn't finish it. At the time of our meeting, I had only 20 or so pages left. And since that time I just can't bring myself to finish it. I just don't care. I usually feel a dutiful responsibility to finish every book I start, let alone one I've invested myself into for several hundred pages. But I just have no inspiration to finish it.I found it tedious and full of tangential diatribes on one subject or another. I'm told this isn't one of Robbins' best books. It'll be awhile before I'm willing to invest my time in giving him another try."
5,Tom Robbins' Best Book,"I have always loved Tom Robbins for his wonderful and quotable turn of phrase. However, Feirce Invalids tells a very compelling and deliciously interesting story that takes the reader from Seattle to South America and finally to the the Middle East. The character line-up includes the wheelchair bound CIA operative, a sexy teen-age temptress, a saucy excommunicated nun, and a guy with a pyramidal head. This is a great read and I would highly recommend reading this one."
2,"Remarkable Language, Tired and Derivative Characters & Plot","Tom Robbins was on a roll all the way through Skinny Legs and All. Then came Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas, which, although it felt a bit like Mr. Robbins felt that he had to write SOMETHING, still had that old magic about it. Now comes Fierce Invalids. The characters are not only two dimensional and anoying, but one (Masked Beauty) is straight out of David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest. The plot is ridiculous, but not quite ridiculous enough, and then the ending is--of all things-- astoundingly safe. Now, the man can write, and that talent has not waned a bit since Another Roadside Attraction, but he seems to be only writing because it's his job. This is too bad, because his talent remains remarkable and unmatched. Would that the muse of inspiration would once again fall upon him. I have confidence that she will, but until then, we have to deal with the likes of Switters and Suzy."
5,Worth the five year wait...,"Fierce Invalids Home From Hot Climates fuses humor, plilosophy, and morbid curiosity into one massive, pulsating, unstable mass, and when it explodes, you can't put it down for all the cocaine in California. Read this novel if you a: Find the word-play of Pablo Neruda exciting, b: Feel the whole world takes itself to seriously for a species that just recently realized the earth was round, or C: Want to find out what is feels like to be a God."
2,"Move Over Tom, Christopher Moore needs this spot !","Even Cowgirls Get the Blues -- 3, Another Roadside Attraction -- 2, Still Life with Woodpecker -- 2, Skinny Legs and All -- 1, Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas -- 1, Jitterbug Perfume -- 2.These are not ratings, they are how many times I have read each book. Get it, I am a Tom Robbins fan! Tom, Tom, Tom, what's the deal? Switters is an interesting enough fellow, I love the use of ""vivid"", the settings are interesting enough, meeting the ""blue nude"" was a stroke of complete ""Tomness"", but WOW, as a whole FIERCE INVALIDS FROM HOT CLIMATES is really lacking. I kept waiting for the novel to jell. It never did. I would have enjoyed another 100 pages to bring things back together. The wind-up of the book was sloppy and amateurish -- I have come to expect SO MUCH MORE from you! What a let down after waiting so long for a new book. And to think I bought it in HARDCOVER!"
2,Kept waiting for something to happen.,"The author spent a good amount of time on creating interesting characters, and clever (sometimes excessively so) dialog, but seems to have forgotten to add a plot."
3,Disappointing Recent Offering,"Robbins most recent offering is deceptive and ultimately disappointing. It's like the hardwood floor in my living room. It looks solid, level, polished. But as soon as I start across it, I notice the scratches and dips; I hear the squeaky creaks and ominous groans. Metaphors aside: 1) The book's plot wanders and stalls in a thoroughly nondelightful manner. The journey itself seems aimless and pointless, and no sub-plots provide relief. 2) The male characters are selfish and short-sighted and not very interesting really. Some protagonists you love to hate. Switters just bores me. And Robbins can't seem to deny him anything. 3) The female characters are bland and restricted. A babe buffet for middle-aged men. Result: Robbins' use of language (as fresh and agile as usual) is not enough to make me overlook the basically disappointing content of this book. (P.S. What is with the annoying repetition of the title phrase?)"
2,Can you say Long-Winded?,"Tom, Tom, Tom.What happened? Your other books started off and got moving. This one languishes in the South American Jungle like so much slowly decaying vegetation. Switters is about as uninspiring a character as any first year english major might crap out after staying up all night with a pot of java. Where is the brillance that starts 'Still Life with Woodpecker?' Where are characters that I can care about like Bonanza Jellybean or the Chink?I'm a hundred pages into it, and have yet to read anything that gives me hope. I'll finish slugging through the book because I find it hard to believe that Tom Robbins could put out complete crap, but I'm going to have to take a couple of six packs with me to make it through."
1,I gave it a Fierce try,"I picked up a few of Tom's books recently. It was just the urge to read an author whose work I'd been familiar with only by name. I had been warned about Tom's liberal use of simile and metaphor as I tore into Still Life. That was an amusing read on the beach. But it all got to be too much to handle in Fierce Invalids. The clever and amusing passages were fewer, and certainly farther between. We made it to about page 220, and were somewhere in Iraq I think, or wherever our jaunt led us from Turkey. ""The desert spread out before him like a giant pizza."" Or something like that. Oh brother. ""Siwtters sweltered, but did not sweat."" I gave up."
1,I'm just not his target audience anymore...,"...BR>This book just bites though. It can't be good that I was seriously wishing the protagonist would just get killed, in a painful way if possible. If I read one more fat old man's theory about how young teenage girls are little sex machines, I'm going to scream. It seemed Tom was trying to normalize his main character's serious sickness by repeatedly (and I do mean repeatedly since he has to say everything 4 or 5 times in this book) explaining that it's all society's fault that 36 year olds aren't supposed to sleep with 15 year olds. So that's gross. Then you add the fact that the plot is moronic and apparently nobody actually edited this thing or suggested he tighten it up, so it draaaaags in many places.The whole thing makes you want to take a shower and never read another one of his books, even if they are cleverly written."
5,A sexy step-sister and feet with no blisters.,"I've read all of Tom Robbins' books and this is a great one. If you don't have a warped sense of humor, don't bother. It really gets the wahoo juice flowing."
2,"Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom","Hate to say it. I REALLY hate to say it. I did not like this book. I couldn't get into it. I really wanted to, I normally LOVE Tom Robbins and was so excited to find he had written a new book. But the characters are not as vibrant as the others. What happened to characters like Gwen and Larry from Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas? (My personal favorite Robbins novel.) Frankly I made it 100 pages in and put it down. I never got interested and it just didn't hold my attention. Such a shame..."
2,Less IS more,"You ever meet someone at a party who seems to be telling you everything he knows? Such a person winds up coming off as not knowing much.Tom Robbins knows much, but feels the need to type every nano-thought he has. If anyone has a moustache, you can be sure that an essay on lip hair isn't far off. If he stares out a window, a meditation on windows is just around the corner.If comedy is all about timing, Robbins is the comedian who barrages his audience, assaulting them. It's like a heavy metal guitar solo. Lots of notes, played fast, but hardly musical.I dug ""Roadside,"" ""Jitterbug,"" ""Woodpecker,"" et all... years ago. Now, Robbins' writing reads like the novel Frasier Crane would write.It's too bad, because I really had good memories of those earlier books.I won't revisit them, however, for I suspect that the style I enjoyed then might prove irritating now."
2,in love with himself,"I wish the author loved himself a little less and loved his readers a little more. I found myself skimming over pages of fat, looking for the meat."
5,A Work of Genius,"Tom Robbins' imagination is wild. He offers a story containing events both ordinary and profound, combined to create an awesome adventure worthy of being shared. CIA agent Switters overflows with vivacity and charisma, offering a glimpse into the world of the 'living', in the truest sense of the word. Just another delectable read brought to us by The Master!"
5,"4.5 stars, a very bizarre book but very interesting","Fierce Invalids Home from Hot Climates is a very bizarre and odd story about a weird CIA agent, and Robbins said that he was inspired by a page in a CIA member's journal entry. Switters, the main character, is very interesting, since he must never set foot on the ground or it will lead it his death, and he goeson interesting missions, including finding out the secrets of the Fantima prophecy in Asia, and sexual experiences. This was my 1st Tom Robbins novel, and Fierece Invalids is a good place to start if you want to read his work."
5,Another Robbins Wonder!,"I eagerly awaited the publication of this book, and while it is not my favorite Robbins writing, I was delighted by reading the adventures of errand-boy extraordinaire Switters. From the Amazon to a convent in a Syrian oasis, Robbins once again creates some amazing characters and circumstances, while throwing in a dollop or two of wisdom, and, as always, presenting it all with a lot of humor. Robbins always speaks truth and his words are a pleasure to not only read, but savor. It took me longer to read this book than any other I've picked up recently, but this was intentional. I enjoyed the pace, the mysteries, the surprises...but most of all I enjoyed the words. Robbins has fun with language, and hence, so do we. Put me in the Switters fan club, for I too love those fierce invalids home from hot climates."
5,perfection,this is the book of books. if you read the one star reviews on this page you'll see people who have read every other tom robbins book and hated this one. that says it all. if you really understand robbins you will not be disappointed.
4,Great Adventure,"This is my second favorite Robbins novel. Though he can get a bit carried away with his obvious devotion of young girls, women lovers, pyramids, the moon, and extreme exotic escapades, this book will definitely make the reader feel as though they're being carried right along for the ride. The cultural aspects of this book are witty and informative, from the Amazon jungles to the dry deserts of Africa, and the ever-Robbins-present Seattle, Washington. There is no dancing around the plot in this novel, you dive right in and get to work. I felt it much longer than most of his work, but it was very enjoyable. Nuns, schoolgirls, and wheelchair bound ex-government officials make this a very exciting and adventurous read."
3,"Great Characters, Great Dialogue, Not So Great Premise","Walking into this story is like walking into a carnival. The characters are bright and interesting. The scenery grabs your attention. And there are lots of bells and whistles to amuse you as you make your way from page to page. In this story, the carnival is the characters and Mr. Robbins' fantastic use of language and dialogue. But when I finished the book, I wondered where the payoff was. Although the book was a pleasant diversion, I could never make any real connection with the story."
4,a pretty darned groovy read,"First of all, I really liked this book. HOWEVER, using the other Robbins books as a scale, I'd put it on a par with ""Another Roadside Attraction."" It wasn't as dizzyingly intricate as ""Jitterbug Perfume"" or ""Even Cowgirls Get the Blues."" However the protagonist, Switters, (refreshing that he was a HE) was more likable than Gwen the Yuppie in ""Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas."" This book is a must for Robbins fans. (by the way, why o why isn't our man Robbins more prolific?)"
5,Fierce it is!,"Fiercely funny, fiercely wise, and the most unusual characters and plot you can imagine. If you love things off the beaten path, mixed with a little sex, a little libation, and a lot of humor this book is for you! And somehow world religion is involved. Tom Robbins is a philosopher/theologian that sees the world from a different angle than the rest of us. And he never misses a chance to laugh at how serious we take ourselves. People of the world...relax!"
2,poor man's vonnegut?,"oh i think so. on robbins-scale i give it a four, but it lacked everything i find interesting in any other book by any one else with any real kind of talent. this is terrible. it's so meaningless, it's drivel."
3,Doesn't live up to my robbins expectations,"I would say that I'm a big Tom Robbins fan.And a huge part of my adoration of him comes from his amazing female charecters. So when I picked up this one and realized the main character was a guy, I was kind of dissapointment.The dissapointment followed me throughout the entire book, which still has the tangly and outlandish plot of a classic Robbins, but I just couldn't fall in love with Switters and therefore didn't fall in love with this book either. Switters is no Sissy Hankshaw or Ellen Cherry."
2,"Either Tom's lost his touch, or I've grown up.","I was a devoted Robbins fan beginning back in the late '70s but was unable to make it more than a fifth of the way through this book. I've got an undying nostalgic affection for Tom and his over-the-top writing style, but he seems to have become overly self-conscious and precious about it. Or it could be the fact that I'm 40 years old and stopped smoking pot years ago . . . I tried very hard to like this book, but found the characters unreachable and the prose ultimately unreadable."
5,Great audiobook,"One of the best audiobooks I've ever heard. Howlingly funny and yet poetic prose, read clearly and with meaning.Buy it."
5,Hooked,"Fierce Invalids was my first Tom Robbins book. As I read it I constantly found myself facing a vivid and masterfull expression of everything I believe in myself. The plot is hilarious, the characters are improbable, the language is out of a master's workshop. I never enjoyed a book more and I wished it would never end -- dragging my reading out as much as possible.Never mind the plot. Read the book for its beautiful and unabashed use of the English language and to understand how to arm yourself against the powers of organized mind-manipulation.Thank you, Tom."
3,Better than nothing,"Anything that Tom Robbins writes is better than almost anything that any one else writes. However... What is up with this Switters? I really didn't find him interesting or enlightening, just verbose, pompous and self absorbed. He didn't develope as a character through the course of the book. I'm not sure that I ever got to know any of the characters very well. Maestra? Should have been more about her. Suzy? Two-dimensional. Domino? We only see these women from Switters perspective, which is, to say the least, not very flattering.And where does Switters end up, back in the Bangkok bargirl scene, having learned nothing from any of his three gals.I guess my biggest complaint is that this book just wasn't much fun! Too many hard to follow monologues from Switters. He may be interesting in real life, but he does not deserve to be one of Tom Robbins main dudes."
5,Wonderful,What a clever little book. In such stressful times it is nice to read a book that has humour as well as some very helpful information. It will be at the top of my holiday gift giving list.
5,A funny & insightful book at a serious time for America.,"This book turned out to be better than I anticipated. Bush stories, Bushisms, politics in America, things to tell our children (""We survived Nixon; you can survive the Bush years."") For all of us who felt numb when Kerry lost, who cannot believe what Bush is doing to our economy & country, this book offers humor and hope. Worth reading & sharing with others. Buy it!"
4,informative and comic,"This little book is silly at times and interesting at others. It is exactly what it says it is. 250 Ways. Albeit some of the ways are drinks to get you by, example ""banana swift boat"" (hardy har har) but other points are actual, valid points. We all know Banana Swift Boat isn't going to get us through the next four years but it's fun to read. But for the more serious, the book gives you organizations to join in order to stay politically active over the next years despite setbacks. I think the best part of this book are the little Bush stories scattered throughout. They are absolutely funny and for me made the whole book worthwhile. I like to show them to my friends. Overall it was a good read but just not enough substance for me."
2,"ok,so what","I was actually surprised to see such high ratings for this book. yeah it's comedic and witty but it's a little bit over the top and after reading it about half the way through the comedy gets old and witt seems more like a person overwhelming disdain for Bush. Even though the book is a more than a bit extreme, I can see the book being useful some weeks and even months after the election, after that i find it useless. Personally the author seems like a an overly bitter democrat who's letting out some aggression that exploded after the 2004 election. I myself sympathize with the author and share some sentiments but some of the stereotypes were just too much and over the top to appreciate. I do admit that the jokes and the Bushisms did serve"
4,Best sander,Best all around sander I've used. Use proper grits or paper may grab and come off and let machine do the job without adding pressure. Works great on dense hardwoods or light softwood. Dust cup could be improved to stay closed.
5,"Sheer Class, A Masterpiece, Oakenfold is God! A Must","Once in a Lifetime a Genius Comes along and if u were listening to this CD then you have just witnessed the biggest Genius of them all - Mr Paul Oakenfold. There is No one out there that can mix a CD which makes you listen to it from start to finish, except Oakenfold. The tracks mix together with such precision that you think they are all the one tune, before you know it the next tune is playing. Cream shall never have another Cd of this quality ever released again and neither will anyone else. The Crowd in the background add to the Magic of it and it makes u want to be there. Tracks such as tilt - Butterfly, Skydive featuring Jan Johnston, Breath in you - Tekara, Children, Rendevous and every other track add to the Journey that is Paul Oakenfold. It makes you want to be at an oakenfold Set and I have had the pleasure of being to him 3 times so I know exactly what the crowd (only there aint one there) are feeling. Oakenfold is God!"
5,Trippin' Pumpin' This CD is GOD,"Probably some of the most beautiful music I have ever heard in my life. Wait, not probably. Definately. I discovered Oakenfold with his Essential Collection he shared with Fatboy Slim. At first I thought it was some washout, but god did I ever swallow my words.Oakenfold serves a delightful dish of steaming music beats that is sure to take you to your own personal never-neverland and back. This is like having your own personal little rave.For music this good I would pay 50.00 (thankfully it was 30.00).If you're considering this album, then quit considering! Go get your grubby little hands on it, and float away!"
2,very very dated,"Hoping this CD is amazing upon many effusive reviews I ordered it and bitterly noticed this was a very very dated and disappointing track selection from the past, and personaly found that live crowd very annoying recorded on the disc. Another sad thing was the CD's sound quality. Sound engineers should have paid more attention to it.However some tracks are still good enough but who wanna spend so much bucks to hear a few good trance tracks."
5,No one can touch him,"I'm a big trance/electronic music fan. I have works all from Sasha and Diggers work to Seaman's and Oaky's previous works etc...But the CD that all got it started for me was Oaky's Tranceport. So after sometime i finally decided to come back to him. I put off this CD for a while mainly because of the price but man oh man do i wish i would of bought this set earlier. From the first track it grabs you and never lets go. Oaky takes you on a non-stop emotional rollercoaster. This set has everything you could possibly wish for, from energetic tracks that you can't help to dance to, to tracks with an awesome groove, to some of the most amazing vocals i have ever heard ( Track 4 on CD 1 ""Shine"" is absolutely mind-blowing and sent chills up my spine. ). Out of all of the sets that i own (And i do own quite a few and growing ) this set is flat out pound for pound the best set out there. Oaky absolutely destroys all competition and walks away from this set as truly untouchable."
5,Nothing but class!,"After reading all your reviews and being a fan of Oakenfold's music i had no other choice but to order this cd. Order it from the U.K that is. I'm telling anybody who is a Paul Oakenfold fan that this CD is a must. Don't be afraid to spend the cash. This CD is worth every cent you spend. Mysteryland, Butterfly, Skydive and Dream Universe are favorites."
4,Banjo-Kazooie for Nintendo 64,"This is an all-around fun game with some obstacles but getting through the game is not that difficult. The characters in the game make funny noises and my favorite character is the bird, Kazooie. The bird does a whole lot of work more than the bear. The story line of the game is really cool and it's a lot of fun getting through the different levels."
5,Wish they make a DS one,"I really love this game a LOT. It was a LOT of fun. Me and my older sister just LOVED playing this game. But then because of space issues and because nobody plays Nintendo 64 anymore. I got rid of Nintendo 64 and all of it's games. Again, nobody plays Nintendo 64 anymore. It's an old out-dated system and all the new games would go to Nintendo Wii or 3DS. :( So, I really hope to see this game resurface. I would like to play it all over again. and I don't see how anybody could get tired of this game. There were so many games that I loved in 64 that I would love to see all over again. The younger generation have no idea how much they are missing out on the good old games. :("
3,It's easy...,"Banjo-Kazooie (weird title) is a video game in which you must collect puzzle-pieces, music notes, aliens...lots of stuff. It's quite easy, and to an expert gamer (not me) it is probably beatable in maybe...3 hours. To little kid's it may be difficult (5-10 year olds) but older children may enjoy it's smooth layout and easy navigation. The graphics are good, they are no comparison to PS2 graphics, but they're good. The object of the game is to open up ""note doors"" in order to progress through the game and ultimately to Gruntilda (the main boss) and to beat her. Overall, Banjo-Kazooie is a good game for a boring afternoon...if ya ain't bored...then, uh, play something else. Banjo-Tooie is better."
3,Horrible,"I felt this game was boring. Atleast at first. It has great graphics, but I feel that the game is way too hard and its a waste of time. It gets boring very easily.Sorry, but those of you that disagree must be more into the game... personally I didn't like it."
1,BROKEN,"I got this Game for my little sister for Christmas, she opened it up, popped it in the N64 and it took us a while to get it to even start... after that, we found out you could not save on it. also the tag was very very worn, it looked like they grabbed it off of a truck or something! im super disappointed, especially since i payed much more than this game is worth."
2,"Great graphics, but graphics don't make it fun","Rare has done a great job with the graphics, but they left out one important detail: gameplay. This game just isn't fun to play. I'd much rather play Mario 64 again."
1,Don't Buy this game,"Banjo-kazooie a game(games are supposed to be fun) Althoghh this game is boring, tedious. Just stick with DK64."
5,Platform at its finest,"This was the second game that i bought for N64 and i must say that is prob. the best game that i have bought yet, ( i know own close to 10 i think ). the graphics in this game are awesome, the story line is cool, and the side puzzles are fun. i would recommend this game to anyone looking for a challenge. there is nothing that i can think of that is wrong with it. just an all around great game."
4,"Fun for young and ""old""","I'm 32 yrs. and bought the game 3 days ago. It's almost more exciting than Zelda. Hardest part is the swimming, this is absolutely nothing like Mario64. Great graphics and certainly a good story to it. Absolutely no regrets in buying this game."
1,Annoying Sounds and Characters,"At first the game is alright, but the characters talk for a long time and all you could is listen. Also there is many annoying sounds. There isn't a lot of adventure either. Unless your around 5 years old you would not enjoy the game."
1,"Campared to the sequel, this is about 700 times better...","When i rented this i returned it after about a half hour. It's the worst game i've ever played besides the sequel or donkey kong 64(which is basically Banjo-Kazooie with a different liscense). To like this game, I'd say you have to have the brain capacity of a dead cow! I appologize to all dead cow enthusiasts for that comment, let me correct myself. You'd have to have the brain capacity of a dead snail to enjoy it. Once again I apologize for the dead snails who wouldn't even like this game."
5,What a Great Game!,"This game is a great game! It can be enjoyed by the whole family. Unlike other games it is a pretty non-violent game. Who wouldn't love a cute bear and bird? Banjo(the bear) set's of with is buddy Kazooie(the bird) to rescue banjo's cute little sister, Tootie, after she is stolen by the evil witch. Together Banjo and Kazooie go through fantastic worlds to eventually fight the witch in a battle of wits and logic. This game helps teach team work, cordination, navigational skills, logic, and memory. It is a total blast for all ages!"
4,Awesome,No box or book as the description said so I got exactly what I was looking for. Plays perfectly and arrived in a very short amount of time. Kudos!
4,DO NOT BUY FROM SELLER apex_media. THIS GAME DID NOT WORK,"I was looking very forward to playing Banjo-Kazooie only to find my cartridge completely unable to work. I didn't have time to play it when I first got it and now that I do, trying to start it up proved useful (my rating of the game only pertains to memories of playing it as a child). Don't buy from this seller apex_media. Now Amazon says it's too late to return and get my money back so I guess I have nothing to do but spread the word about this guy selling broken items."
4,A satisfying sequel,"Sequels tend to be risky things: all too often, they fail to live up to the original. And while THE WEAVER TAKES A WIFE is a very hard act to follow, the author has nothing to be ashamed of in BRIGHTON HONEYMOON. The ""new"" couple's story is somewhat slow in getting started, but the author's wit is as sharp as ever, and keeps the reader turning pages until his/her interest is fully engaged. I understand Ms. Cobb-South has a third ""Weaver"" book scheduled for next year. I, for one, can hardly wait!"
3,Not quite as good as its prequel...,"When I finished reading THE WEAVER TAKES A WIFE I couldn't wait to read the next in the ""series,"" BRIGHTON HONEYMOON. While I quite enjoyed this book it just didn't seem up to par with its predecessor. The writing is good but the characters aren't as vivid as Mr. Brundy and Helen. Overall, I enjoy Ms. South's writing and can't wait to read her next book."
1,Scary,"Although the illustrations are captivating, the story line is eerie and sad. Luckily, my grand daughter is not yet reading so I can change the plot line as we read it."
3,Sex ed for preschool?,"I bought this at a Scholastic sale for my preschool class. Thank goodness I read it first before reading it to the kids. Yes, the repetitious phrases, the counting, the rhymes, the illustrations are all quite good. Then it ends with a one little fish waiting for another they love each other now one is a father and another is a mother. I can just hear my curious kids ask - how did that happen? And why are there 10 more little fish? Great book - but just be prepared to answer some rather tough questions, or be prepared to just skim over that part."
3,nice colors but...,Nice colors but not enough value for price paid. There are better books that I bought similar to this. Review my books and you'll see which I was impressed with for my toddler.
5,Love it!,This is an adoble book with delightful artwork. It will be one I buy for any small child or for a baby shower.
4,Curry flavor! Cheesy goodness!,"A curiosity for world music aficianados and a must for serious Shania fans, this album is worth owning for the kitsch value alone. With sitars and tablas adorning insanely catchy melodies and relentlessly upbeat lyrics, it's a Bollywood soundtrack from an alternate dimension. Several songs much blander in their pop and country incarnations benefit greatly from the Indian treatment. ""I'm Jealous"" is lovely and the otherwise awful ""She's Not Just A Pretty Face"" gains an unexpected poignancy. There are also splashes of dub reggae, latin guitar flourishes, even some Celtic-sounding tin whistle and fiddle on ""(Wanna Get To Know You) That Good!"". Overall, a deliciously guilty pleasure."
2,Half as Good as Original,"Blue disc sounds strangly like the music from Tetris. My favorite song from the green and red discs (""Nah!"") is quite possibly my least favorite song on the blue disc. I got the same feeling from listening to this as I got when I learned the truth about Santa. It's a shame too, since blue is my favorite color. I'm glad I downloaded the songs instead of paying for the album. If you, however, crank up the volume when you play Tetris, you'll love this album for the beat and the cleaver lyrics throughout."
5,Former teen dance queen grows up...,"I must admit that when I first heard Lynda's 3rd album, I was a little put off since I was such a huge fan of her two previous efforts. This album is very different from the trashy dance music she was known for. This album really grew on me and is now constantly in my cd player. A much more evolved sound, very deep and the vocals I've come to love from her. I am also glad that she is finally getting the international recognition she so deserves, as she's scored a hit single in Spain and is now finally getting a US release. Fave track: Maldita Timidez."
4,Great Mexican pop!,"Mexican singer Lynda FINALLY gets a US release of one of her fabulous CDs...""Mi Dia De La Independencia"" is a bit of a change from her previous two CDs, and we find her aping Shakira on some tracks (funny since Shakira slavishly imitates Alanis Morrissette). There's still a lot to enjoy on this CD, but we can only hope she gets back some of her own identity on the next one!This is a good taste of Mexican bubblegum pop, something we don't hear enough of, even with the supposed ""Latin explosion""."
5,So smooooth!,"Bought this in the store because of the price. It was already charged when I took it out of the box. So what the hey, decided to test drive this baby! Shaved my legs, arms and bikini in a few minutes. I was really impressed at how smooth my arms and bikini area got. I was worried because I heard that electric shavers dont get as close as razors but I am pleased. Smooth and quick, I can live with this!"
2,"Not bad, but not great shaver",I purchased this shaver as I can no longer use a razor blade to shave my legs due to medical issues. The shaver tends to 'chew' up my skin and it takes many passes in order to cut the hairs. I've used it for one month and noticed that the blades are already dull. I will be looking for another razor soon.
3,Electric Razor,"Not too bad for an electric razor. It holds a charge nicely but when you put it on the charger, you have to move it around a bit to get the connection made. Also, it seems like it is getting dull faster than the the one I used to have."
2,Seems good at first,I ordered this because of its good reviews and I was totally happy with it for less than a year. That's when it stopped charging. Think of this razor as a throw-away.
3,"Good razor, but not usable for international travelling","The result of the shaving is ok. In general I prefer a wet shaver and therefore I mainly use this razor for the bikini area, only. It works quite good, but I have more skin irritations than compared to my Braun shaver I am using for many years now.One big negative point: The power supply supports 110 Volt only. Therefore this shaver is not designed for the use for travelling to Europe or somewhere else where 220 Volt are used. (I also checked with Panasonic: they don't offer any alternative power supply for this device.)"
2,Great until....,Fabulous razor until the head rusted and until it stopped charging. I'm very disappointed.
4,"highly satisfactory, but maybe I'm picky","This is an excellent product. It does everything it's supposed to do, but maybe I had high standards. The trimmer which pushes up often snags my hair, especially along the bikini line, which is where it is meant to help mostly, and I often end up with a little blood, probably from the snag pulling at my hair so hard.Also, you have to use it slowly if you're looking for a close shave. It isn't as close as a regular razor, but it NEVER has given me irritation or bumps, and I ALWAYS got that with my regular razor. I can also shave daily now, which I was never able to do before because my skin was too sensitive and I would end up with horrible razor burn.I find it works best slowly, in the shower, with shaving cream, on your legs and armpits. Not bikini. I'll stick to my old razor for that.Overall, great product, but after reading 35+ five star reviews, I guess I was expecting something perfect."
3,Good shaver. Not Excellent,"This shaver is good for its price. It lasts long enough on single charge. But does not give close shave as blade. Nevetheless the shave is pretty neat. You need to be bit careful with the trimmer, it can chew up your skin if run over your skin very rapidly."
2,Does Not Last Long.,"I purchased this over a year ago and it worked great in the beginning. Although it's a bit loud to my liking, it did it's job on the legs. After a year and having to recharge so many times, it pretty much lost its mojo. Now that I try to recharge it and power on, it doesn't do anything. After a year of using this electronic shaver, it got weak and served no purpose. Time to switch to another brand..."
4,I'm glad I got it,I'm glad I got this shaver-I no longer have to make sure I have extra cartirdges on hand. It works to my satisfaction- wet or dry and it does the job- Alice
5,"the next best thing,,,,","I have never really liked shaving my legs, messy and usually getting nicks or having some burning for the next day.I haveb tried several electric razors over the years and was never quite satisfied with the result, (they all left stubble) but I recently purchased the panisonic electric razor and can hardly believe the close shave it gives me...... almost like a real razor, but without any discomfort......I would highly recommend it to all women and the ease of use - I can do this while watching tv and always feel comfortable now.carol"
5,Reliable and Convenient,"I bought this a year ago and it's great. I use it both dry, and in the shower with shower gel, so I no longer have to buy shaving cream. I won't get into the details of my personal hygiene here :) but suffice to say that I am very satisfied with this, and can't imagine going back to waxing or shaving with razors. The bikini line feature is very useful as well."
4,Good razor,"This razor turned out to be just what I wanted. Not bumps no irritation, shave was as close as my other razor, hair grew back slower, worked great for bikini/armpit area."
3,Not as close as expected,"I have an old electric Remington shaver (corded, can't use in water) and thought it would be nice to upgrade to one that would theoretically get a closer shave and could be used in the shower. Although the feel of this in the hand is nice, I have gotten several ""razor burns"" when trying to get a close enough shave. The Panasonic does do well in the water, and is easy to charge.The drawback to this razor, to me, is that my 25 year old dry Remington does just as good a job as this Panasonic. I really expected that there would be some improvements in electric razors over this time period.I would NOT buy this again, given that I already have an electric razor."
4,Heartbreaking,"You must read this book slowly.I could only handle about 30 pages a day. Not because it isn't a good book. It is. The characters get in your head and stay there. They will stay with you after you have finished the book. This is one of the best written books of the last 5 years (that I have read,anyway).However,I can't give this book 5 stars because ultimately it is just too bleak.Nothing good happens to anyone through 432 pages.Unless you're Dickens, good writing can't stop a really depressing story from wearing a reader out.I liked this book,really, but it was too devestating to read quickly. I felt I had to take a break to recover after each session. I work across the street from the WTC so the last 50 pages were particularly difficult to get through. This is not really a criticism though, more of a warning for those considering reading this book.It is a difficult but in the end a rewarding and unforgettable read."
2,I finished it but.......,"This is my first ever review, and it's because I feel quite strongly about this book. The writing was good, the characters were usually interesting, etc., but there was nothing that tied them together, except that they lived in the same building in NYC. It was hard to maintain interest in the characters because they only appeared occasionally and not in conjunction with the others. I did find the descriptions of NYC and the World Trade Center's attacks poignant."
5,a novel of characters,"Between Two Rivers is something different from the usual adventure story or chick lit, a novel that really invests in characters and how they change over time. It’ll be a long while before I forget about the tenants of Echo Terrace, from the all-knowing concierge to the dying frozen-food magnate in the penthouse. And the writing is as smooth as silk."
2,A gay bodice-ripper !,"As expected from this series there is plenty of sex. Jack Gorden introduces some novel ideas (straight sex, watching rutting deer, hermaphrodites) but ultimately I was diasappointed. The bookish Christopher and his Irish bit of rough didn't ring true and some of the scenes were unintentionally comic. Readers should note that less than half the novel is set aboard the ship...the rest in London and rural England. But I don't want to sound too harsh. I wasn't expecting great literature and the fact that I didn't get turned on may be a purely personal reaction. I still think ""Conquistador"" is the best of this series."
4,Clever way to dump your man!,"The cover of the book was what immediately caught my attention. As I read the back cover, I thought this was a clever way to end your current relationship and to be guilt-free when you start your new one. But the question is, are you truly guilt-free? All in all this was a good fun read. Prudence and her friends make this a drama-filled search to finding a new wife for Reilly. But we really can't judge Prudence.... we all have once or twice thought ""what if"" about the one who got away."
3,The Wife Of Riley,"I only gave this book 3 stars because Of the way it ended. Although I guess it was inevitable how it would turn out. I did think she deserved the outcome, as she didn't realize what she had until she lost him(her husband).I was hoping she would come to her senses, which by the time she did it was to late!!"
1,Skip It,"I forget who recommended this book to me, but I can not read it. I started it, expecting a fun, light read--which maybe it is. I do not appreciate the author's style, which is to add spaces in between paragraphs and character's quotes. I found myself getting a headache reading it as it just does not flow smoothly because of this weird style. There were also a few misprints in the first few pages (an incorrect name of a character as they're being introduced, then it says ""High Heffner"" instead of Hugh Heffner). Just annoying. When I got to High Heffner, I gave up. If I'm going to read a light book, it needs to be easy to read."
2,Premise not developed,"The premise for this book seems as though it could make an interesting story. Unfortunately, this is not well developed. The story seems to touch lightly on dozens of things and doesn't have any depth or feeling to it."
5,Sinful Fun for the Married Woman!,"Though very happily married, I thoroughly enjoyed this hilarious book about infidelity from Jennifer Coburn. I loved Prudence's inner voices (her Conscience, Guilt and especially her Inner Male-you can imagine what THAT tells her to do!). I could easily see The Wife of Reilly being turned into a hit movie! Read it and laugh out loud while your husband's channel-surfing. Then pass the word on to all your female friends, especially New Yorkers. The Wife of Reilly is witty, wicked, and great fun!"
5,Great story and very funny! I highly recommend!,"I loved it! If you like Jane Green, Marian Keyes or even if your just a female you'll LOVE this book! I laughed out loud and could completely relate to so much of the story even though I'm very happily married. The main character was very likeable and I couldn't wait to see what she did next. I can't wait for Jennifer Coburn's next novel!"
1,I really wanted to like this book...,"I wanted to like this book, but it was ...just truly awful. This sounded like a great premise - wife has found someone else and wants to find a replacement wife for her husband.Based on the reviews I thought it would be sort of madcap crazy, but funny. What a disappointment!! It was just clunky, with dumb people and totally implausible situations. The heroine, Prudence was unlikeable. I deleted it from my Kindle, but regret the time I spent reading and hoping for it to get better and start making sense."
1,Hated this book,"I am glad I got this book for free or I would be asking for my money back. The main character in the book is self-centered, immature and just plain awful. She has an affair on her husband of eleven years with a man that treated her like garbage in college. So she suddenly decides that the scumbag is the love of her life and she should find a wife for her ""poor"" husband. I mean how can her husband survive without her? She shows such arrogance and a lack of respect towards her husband. I don't think that she ever truly loved him at all. He was just someone that agreed to marry her. I have never truly hated a book as much as I do this one. I love to read and I probably read at least 3 books a week on my Kindle. This is one book that I will never go back to and if I would have bought the paperback or hardcover I would have burned it in effigy."
1,Don't waste your time,"After two chapters I was tempted to put this book down and forget about it. But I finished it with hopes that I wasn't wasting my time. By the way of totally disregarding marriage vows and committing adultry to confessions of a past abortion to doing drugs, I was disgusted with this book. The author attempts to make things that are wrong in society acceptable to make her weak character seem more human. If you have a high moral character this is not the book for you."
2,With Friends Like This...,"The prose is well written, but the protagonist is absolutely unlikable. The problem is not that she's flawed. The problem is that she is incredibly self-involved and self-serving. Her behaviors are cruel to others.This isn't a horrible book, but I was left wondering why anyone would choose to be friends with this woman."
2,What?,"I don't understand all the glowing, positive reviews. Well, yes, the book was well written and the characters developed somewhat well. But he main character, Prudence, what a despicable human being. I couldn't even connect with her on any level. none whatsoever. She is totally self absorbed, only barely finds herself by the end of the book, and is the most selfish person ever depicted. Thank God I got this as a free book, I would have been sorely disappointed otherwise. I skipped through many paragraphs of uninteresting and unnecessary dialogue about the characters inane lives."
1,Boring,"I couldn't even finish this book it was so boring. To many details about nothing. Sure it was free, now I know why. I really tried to finish this book but onlu reach the 5 chapter and I couldn't go on."
5,great for the non-chicklit reader,"i'm not deeply into ""chick lit"" -- as that term is typically used -- but i thoroughly enjoyed ""wife of reilly"". it has a darker-than-usual sensibility and a nice, snarky sense of humor."
3,Average at best.,This book was more like a bad made for TV movie on Lifetime. Absurd plot and timeline and an even more ridiculous ending.
4,Fun read,"Flawed, always in a frenzy, fabulous character in Prudence, the heroine. The book is actually part 1 and part 2. I liked part 2 a lot when she starts to realize who she is and what she had done to end up where she is. Her friends are really great, anyone would be lucky to have a bunch like that. Maybe some spin off books about them would be really fun."
4,Decent read,"I got this book as a free offering and enjoyed it as such. I may or may not buy another book from this author again. Honestly, the story line was a bit too dramatic for my taste."
3,Good,"Good info. Easy read. Nothing to rave about but as a free kindle download, I enjoyed it. Would recommend to anyone."
1,I'm so disappointed in this book,"Reading the book description and reviews I had high hopes for this book. I was expecting a funny entertaining read, unfortunately it was anything but that. Another reviewer said the ""the main character in the book is self-centered, immature and just plain awful"" and I have to agree wholeheartedly. She realy is an idiot. There is NO ONE on earth that could possibly be diluted enough to have the same ideas, thoughts and plans as this woman. I thought that maybe once she finally told her husband she wanted a divorce, everything would get better.... but it didn't.I'm the kind of person that finishes every book I start, even if I don't particularly like it. This book is so awful, boring and honestly just stupid, I can't even finish it. I bought the book in March and have been trying to read it every since. I read 80% and I just can't go on, it's too bad. There really aren't enough negative things I could possibly say. If I could give the book 0 stars I would."
3,the grass - isn't always greener,"When you act on impulse and deny a piece of your life to better ""fit"" into a new vision / version - and deny all that you are or need - you get a mess. And sometimes you aid the mess along. That is exactly what the main character, Prudence, does to herself, her friends and her husband.Dialogue was wonderful, you can actually read this aloud and it fits neatly into a discussion at the corner table at the coffee shop. The premise ? Oh who hasn't wondered about that old ""love"" and 'what if' - most of us leave that at that stage.The most interesting transformation/character development was in Prudence herself - seeing her lose the shell and remove and become more fully a woman and a person and less of a character of the yuppie female.Thoroughly enjoyable, and despite the outrageous situation - something you can almost see as a viable option. Almost. Which is what good fiction does."
2,This women is a disgrace,Women like this deserve nothing in the end. But being a story she made out ok. The only part I laughed at was her car ride with her fiance best friend on their trip to the ski resort. Don't read this story unless you can relate to cheating on your loved ones.
2,I was expecting funny,I kept hoping this book would get better better but it did not.The plot line sounded good but it feel flat one it's face.
1,I couldn't finish the book,"I tried. I really did. I just couldn't bring myself to get more than a third through the book. I just couldn't find anything to like about the main character. I could go into details, but I'm not going to waste my time on a story about a woman I can't stand. Maybe the story is funnier later, but it's not so far."
2,"The story line had possiblilities, but didn't come through",The main character was unlikeable and the story dragged. I gave it 2 stars because it the grammar was fine.
1,A Wife for Reilly- yeah poor guy,"This was not worth the time to read beyond 1chapter. I read the entire book in awe of how awful someone could be! Kind of like a train wreck! The heroine was self absorbed,beyond reasoning! Ugh.So many reviews were from authors I like.I don't get that.THERE are so many great books out there, don't waste your time onthis one. It's beyond awful..! If I could rate a minus star- it would be minus 5."
2,"I wanted to like this, but...","the main character was SO self-absorbed, and didn't exhibit any growth. It's not really a romance -- more women's fiction or chick lit. Prudence is really shrewish and her friends are so cardboardy that I finally forced myself through the end and was left with a sense of ""meh."" I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, though I might try another of Coburn's books, just to see if this was a one-off and her others are better."
3,Easy to follow recipes!,"I own several korean cookbooks, and when I cook many recipes from those cookbooks, Some of the foods that I have made did not taste like an authentic korean foods that I had in korea, either from korean families or in korean restaurants. This book also does not contain very many recipes inside. But, I like this book is easy to use, because you can put it flat on the counter."
3,Lee Wade's Korean Cookery,This is a good cook book for Non-Koreans or Koreans who would like to learn to cook Korean dishes. I found the receipes a bit on the weak side but was able to adjust easily with a pinch of this or a pinch of that. I recommend people do the same and experiment with it. The ingredients are easy to find because the author replaces a lot of the hard to find items with easier substitutes. I really like how the authors continued Mrs. Lee Wade's efforts to finish this cookbook.
5,we love this!!!,this racquet is the best item ever. we have grain moths we had a hard time getting rid of and it worked on those. Ther real test was when fruit fly season came and it worked wonders! I had to come down to get them but in no time the fruit flies were gone. my husband had me buy another one so we are always ready no matter where we are in the house...
3,"Cheap, not powerful","Both of them broke within 2 weeks of buying them. Get one with D Batteries if you are going to get one and buy several at once, they're going to break eventually no matter which brand you buy."
2,Very powerful but dangerous,"This swatter can kill very large bugs because it holds a larger voltage difference than other electric swatters (I know because there are 3 different brands at my work).However, the other two swatters have the protective screen. This has no protective screen and thus you can accidentally shock yourself or electronic equipment.If you want a fun way to kill cockroaches then get this. If you have pesky flying insects get a protected screen one (like from Hunters Guide)."
1,It did not work.,We had to return the insect terminator. We put batteries in it but it DID NOT work. Our money was refunded.
5,"Real People, Real Awesome Movie","This film was actually taped in my community. Many of my classmates can be seen in the sale scenes. I still remember the buzz going around the town about the film. I love it, and if you love it to, feel free to visit Anita, Iowa."
2,COMMIT TO THE INDIAN,I love anything on the blackhawks but was a little disappointed with this dvd. Iwas looking for more old footage of the playoffs and there was a lot of people talking about the team so it came off like reading a book. OK but no great shakes.
4,Heartwarming,"This is an anecdotal style book that uses many personal stories to illustrate examples of lovingly interacting with your children and giving them appropriate responsibilities. It is not a practical, how-to manual, and because they are not professional writers, it is a bit slow in parts. I nodded my head in agreement with many of the ideas. I would like to have read a few more practical strategies vs. general ideas. I would recommend it to readers who hope to integrate faith and parenting."
5,An excellent summary of good-parenting techniques,"This is an engaging and well written book. While the author's techniques are not always easy to implement, it is difficult to imagine how such techniques would not result in children to be proud of"
1,well written but too preachy,"I was hoping to find more practical, hands-on suggestions, but there were too many references to prayer, trust in God, etc. That's fine and I'm glad it works for them, but I want more problem-solving solutions, in the vein of case studies and postulates, rather than anecdotes and answered prayers."
5,"This is my ""bible.""","I have read all of the books by Almaas and am in the Ridhwan school. This book is both brilliantly articulate and comprehensive. I often go to the index and scan it at this point. There, I will find a word that catches my attention, and turning to the page where it is addressed will open a universe of meaning for me. My only difficulty with Inner Journey Home is that this is my third copy. The others have come apart at the seams from my use."
5,Great album,"I grew up watching this movie and so did my husband, so I decided to give it to him as a valentine's day present and we both love it!"
4,Great soundtrack but cheaper on company website,"I adored this movie as a child and I wore out the cd...and my own vocal cords (attempting to sing along). I'm now in my late 20s and I still love singing along. Even as a young girl I could appreciate a handsome man with an amazing singing voice. ; )It had been years since I listened to it--but the instant I did, all the lyrics came flooding back, as if I just heard it yesterday. If you're a sap for musicals or just really good music, you'll enjoy this.Just want to let you all know, it is cheaper to buy the cd from the Featured Films for Families webiste than on here. Amazon will probably frown upon me saying so, but there you have it."
5,fluids and electolyte madness,"I have found this book to be very helpful in understanding the fluid balances. When in nursing school we did not spend much time (one day in lecture) covering fluids and electrolytes, now that I am practicing I find that I need to understand the balance as it effects everything. This book has been really helpful, very good reference."
5,Excellent book!,What a great book and so easy to read. It helped me understand the material in class. Can't get enough of reading it.
2,Incredibly boring!,"This entire series of ""Incredibly Easy"" books should be called ""Incredibly Boring""! I've found all of them to be useless in keeping my attention or in helping me to remember. There is nothing memorable about anything in these books."
5,A great aid in learning....,"There are many different types of learners, and while my text was often hard for me to understand, these books have been great ""helpers""....often I would read the text, come to these books, then go back to my text and have an ""Aha"" moment....I highly recommend this and the Pathophysiology book at this point in my education..."
4,Confused Nursing Students Start Here!,"In my first year of Nursing school I had a professor at the ""nation's largest women's college"" who tried to teach us 'the basics"" on fluid and electrolytes and on ABG's. Well she either did a really horrible job, or all 80 of us are really too stubid to have been accepted there :) This year the school 'recommended' this book. We all got it. From the first sentence in Chapter 3, it seemed like my entire mind cleared up. I could not fathom that this subject could really be this easy. In short, I passed the first test we had without having to disturb my own fluid balance at all! Get this book, whether your professor know's how to teach it or not, this will help you through the craziness of nursing school."
5,Very helpful for nursing,"I got this book because I was having a hard time with the subject in my first year nursing classes. I feel like it helped alot by breaking down the subect into simple bites and going over each electrolyte, imbalance, and common medical causes individually. I definately feel that it helped me to pass my exams that year. In short, a great review book if your having a hard time with the subject."
5,Excellent source!!!,This a great book for understanding fluids and electrolytes!!! Couldn't get better and easier than this!!!!
5,Great supplimental resource.,"I'm in my last year of nursing school and this book has been wonderful. It puts the harder concepts into ""Kool Aid"" terms for an easier understanding. I highly recommend this book to those who struggle with Fluid and Electrolytes."

4,Ford does much better than the Edsel,"This is definitely a quality book. It is a very well developed story with interesting characters. The story builds very well and the conclusion is satisfying. I would recommend this book to any avid mystery reader. I am a big fan of Robert Parker, Robert Crais, and Harlan Coben. While Leo Waterman doesn't have the sidekick that the hero in those books does, he has much the same demeanor as Spenser, Elvis Cole, and Myron Bolitar. The wit isn't quite as snappy, but still enjoyable. These are only minor comments and what prevents me from giving the book 5 stars, don't let it prevent you from reading this book. I have a ton of books, but I am sure that I will pick up another one of Ford's novels sometime in the near future."
3,"It comes with a nice phone cord & reel, but didn't work w/XP","I'm a computer technician and bought this for a customer's computer, but when I installed it, it did not work with Windows XP. I read of a few other users online that had the same problem, so you might want to avoid this card if you have or will have XP on your laptop."
2,CRAM THE GLAM!,"GLAM BAM THANK YOU MA'AM-VARIOUS ARTISTS: At least this campy compilation of GLAM goodies gets it half right...romper-stompers SLADE, SWEET and the always creepy GARY GLITTER make the glam grade, shouting out bona fide classics like CUM ON FEEL THE NOIZE (more subtle and satisfying than the QUIET RIOT retread), the percussive BALLROOM BLITZ, and sports arena anthem ROCK & ROLL PART 2. JOAN JETT's role model SUZI QUATRO and the ever tasty MOTT THE HOOPLE are also welcome choices, though one could quibble about the inclusion of punk godfathers LOU REED and IGGY POP. German synth-popper KLAUS NOMI's wretched version of DING DONG THE WITCH IS DEAD doesn't belong, nor does the ""glam"" in name only ballad GLAMOUR BOY by THE GUESS WHO. The eclectic, electronic BRIAN ENO also feels outta place here, especially when T. REX and DAVID BOWIE (whose SUFFAGETTE CITY this disc nicks its title from) are missing in action. It seems that all that glitters is not necessarily gold.RATING: TWO LIPSTICKS"
5,An antidote to the immense stresses of 21st century life,"Two accompanying audio CDS offering guided meditation, stretching advice, and relaxation techniques complement Stress Management Made Simple, an excellent antidote to the immense stresses of 21st century life as offered by author, medical doctor, and stress management instructor Jay Winner, M.D. From learning how to manage anger and frustrating, to improving the quality of one's sleep, to simply better enjoying one's day, Stress Management Made Simple is an easy-to-read, ""reader friendly"", highly recommended addition to Self-Help reading lists , Self-Improvement reference library collections."
5,A Real Winner!,This book is a real winner! The book and 2 CDs are amazing. You will feel the stress leave your body as you read or listen. I have read the book and have incorporated many of its elements into my own pediatrics practice. Buy a copy for yourself and another for someone you love. A great value! Be sure to check out www.stressremedy.com
1,Dr. Winner's book / CDs are not winners!!!,"The first few chapters of the book are fairly good in the discussion of stress management; however,the remaining chapters are nothing more than a retelling of ""highly effective people"" books. Dr. Winner's 2 free 6 minute sample exercises on his website are identical to the ones on the CDs, and he repeats (in the exact same words) those exercises using different titles to lengthen the CDs. The free sample exercises on his website are gimmicks to enhance buyers. Don't waste your money!"
3,A mixed bag,"The plot revolves around a young man whose father was a Soviet agent exposed by way of a House Un-American Activities Committee hearing and his efforts first, to live down the trauma this introduced into his life, and then to redeem his father's memory. While working as a research assistant he receives a request from his father to meet him in Prague, then suffering through the aftermath of the Prague Spring of 1968.The book falls into three distinct parts, a plodding and interminable prelude, an exciting and well written middle, and an implausible and unsatisfying ending. The middle probably makes the rest worth reading."
4,Another wonderful book by Kanon,This is what I hoped it would be from reading his other books. You have to like the subject matter. The history. The Cold War. McCarthyism. It's the character development and interaction that kept me reading. The dialog goes on and on but I didn't get tired of it because it made the characters real. Kanon has a unique style that really grew on me. It helped that I liked the characters too. I even became sympathetic to the supposed traitor. I look forward to his next book.
3,It Loses Steam As The Story Moves Along,"I found the book very good in the beginning. It appeared it was going to be a first rate thriller. The story begins in 1950 in the McCarthy Communist witch hunt era & moves through the Vietnam & peace protest era of the late 60's. There was tremendous potential in that era for an excellent Cold War spy thriller. Unfortunately Mr. Kanon missed the mark.I found the book became tedious & predictable, taking too long to unravel it's story. The ending was only OK in that you can see much of it coming. Compared to a very good start, the ending was rather flat. There are parts which are completely improbable. The J. Edgar Hoover meetings as one exampleI found myself scanning through pages just to finish the novel."
3,"Slow start, but hang in there","I really enjoyed Los Alamos, so I was looking forward to reading another book by this author. This book managed to overcome a general rule I have with any book. If it hasn't really captured my attention by the end of 50 pages I cut my losses. In this case, it took about 100 pages (about 20% of the book), which provides background info from the main character's youth. The information is important to the overall plot, but could have been accomplished in less than 50 pages. Not sure why I stuck it out, but I'm glad I did. The book picks up the pace, providing a decent amount of suspense. Although I liked Los Alamos better, it probably had more to do with a setting I thought was more interesting. This is a good book, but I'm not sure if I read it first I'd be all that interested in reading other works by the author."
4,divided loyalties,an historical novel of the not so distant past. the red scare with hoover setting up his own police state in an ironic emulation of the ostensible enemy. a family is torn apart by the then prevailing zeitgeist. prague behind the iron curtain is skillfully brought to light.
4,Well-written: What do you want?,"Good spy story, great setting, sense of place, but above all, wonderful, thoughtful turns of phrase that make you read whole paragraphs out loud to the person next to you. I wish novels came stamped with a code that indicated that pleasure was within."
2,Predictable outcome with lost potential,"I feel a need to warn those readers who don't read past the first few reviews to take your time before ordering this book. While Kanon's first book, Los Alamos, may not have won prizes for literary writing, it was intelligent, creative and instructive. The Prodigal Spy had so much potential. The story could have happened, the characters could have been real. But the final result: hackneyed dialogue, unbelievable characters, and an ending I guessed after the first chapter. The best parts: the lasting pain of the McCarthy hearings, a reminder of FBI abuses, and the excellent descriptions of eastern Europe. Keep trying, Mr. Kanon. I'm still intrigued enough with your innate talents and insights to try the next one."
3,Historical spy thriller?,"The time frame and historical perspective made this book a little different. The story unfolds slowly and sometimes the author has characters withhold key facts so that the book can add 20 extra pages of filler, making the story unnecessarily drawn out. As the story finally approaches its climax the pace picks up but the majority of the book seems unnecessarily slow."
5,Hot Cold War Thriller,I read this because author Lee Child recommended it. You will not be disappointed--felt like old times settling in to read a John LeCarre novel. Enjoy!
2,GLACIAL PACE,"The writing is excellent and characters are rich BUT the plot moves at such a glacial pace that after 250 pages not a lot has happened!!! And your eyes start to glaze over and you truly age!!!! LOL. I read some of the other reviews and they gave it 4 stars with a ""predictable ending"". Well if it's so predictable and obvious, why give it 4 stars?? I think if the pace of the book was better I would have rated it higher too, but at this point I don't even care to finish it."
2,The Prodigal Spy,"Excellent writing ruined by an all too predictable ending. If one does not figure out who ""Silver"" is by page 220, go back to the fundamentals of mysteries and read ""The Hardy Boys"" series. However, the last three pages was an unexpected twist I had not counted on.The only reason I granted two stars was because the begining was so intriguing and wonderfully structured. I really felt the pain the young Nick went through.Over all, no go."
3,diappointing,I loved Joseph Kanon's previous novels. This one was very disappointing. Dull- no plot to speak of. Seemed like he couldn't come up with a storyline so he used old spy masters stories.
4,Good read,"Not as good as Los Alamos, but definitely well worth reading. Couldn't put the book down after I started."
4,The Prodigal Spy,"""The Prodigal Spy"", by Joseph Kanon. The author talks about a little kid, Nick, who was trying the best to help his father, Wolter Kotlar. A lot people were accusing him from being a communist. It's a Wonderful book full of mystery, suprises and loving between father and son, husband and wife. I recomment this book to every each of you. Joseph had done a great job to evoke the feeling from a son toward his father. It's an Excellent book."
3,Great product/update,"I have had to get up at least once every night to urinate over the last four years and I would get a total of about 3 to 4 hours of uninterrupted sleep during that time. Since I started taking this product a week ago, I'm getting at least two more hours of sleep every night before I have to get up to urinate. May not sound like much but six hours of uninterrupted sleep vs. 3 or 4 is a BIG difference - particularly in how you feel the next day. Would definitely recommend this product to anyone!!Unfortunately, it quit workin well after a few weeks"
5,Great results,Tried a few prostate supplements before being turned on to this by a golf buddy. Saw noticeable results after about two weeks. Definitely getting up less in the evening and less general discomfort overall. Would recommend to anyone suffering from BPH or looking for a preventive supplement.
1,Didn't do a thing for me,I pee a lot. It's what I do. Been checked by the doc as recently as 3 months ago. Everything was good so maybe this didn't help me because my problem is not linked to my prostate. I'm sure it goes back to my troubled childhood... as all problems with the world do.I figured I'd give it a shot since it wasn't outrageously expensive and got some good reviews. Maybe it'll work for you. Maybe not.
4,Playstation heaven!,"Crash warped was really neat. Though it was very similar to all the other crashes it was my favorite. This time you get new villians and new partners. I enjoyed this game alot. And now that its price has lowered I may even buy it. Though it was similar it was sure different. I would compare this game to Bugs Bunny lost in time, because if you like that game you are going to like this. You see I can't tell you wether to buy it or not but it sure kept me up all night trying to beat this game."
5,Excellent replay value,"Haven't played any of the other crash bandicoot series, but I must say that this was a ton of fun. It's just a colorful adventure game with really amazing replay value. Definitely recommend it!!"
3,Crfash Bandicoot: Warped,"This was the very first Crash game I played. I don't think ,other then the save, that it's better than the first one. I have to say that N.gin is always an awsome boss. The battle of N.tropy is a phenomanon and 1/2. Uka Uka is also a nice little battle. But, I don't like the motercycle levels. The time trial is ridiculous, and the gems are almost impossable. I love the first game and all the other games, but the first one will always be a favorite. Don't get me wrong, even though this games is not the best so far in the series, but it's very well done concerning secrets. I love a game that has secrets. Here's a cheat, in level 14 on the left side o f the screen, smash a sign with a cross-bones on it in stead of a directional arrow. It will take you to a secret place. ..."
4,Only one prob...,The game itself is great. The only prob is that the first five levels are mind-numbing compared to the rest of the game. If your not a video-game master mind like the person who wrote the first reveiw... you won't get anywhere in the game.
5,The Bandicoot is back,"The Crash games for playstion are very fun games,even better than the mario games. Out of the Crash seires I think this one is the best. There are alot of thing you can do and the bosses rock. The story line is the best in this game. It takes plase after Crash2 were Dr.Cortex ship falles down on a temple, wich releses a demon mask. The mask that pertected crash in the first two games stats talking and tells crash that the evil mask is his Brother and his plan to build a time machine to get crystles todestroy earth. The replay vaule is high and the gamplay is fun, you won't be able to put this game down for awile."
2,Not Easy,"I bought this game about a week ago, but it was not easy for me. Sure I'm not a Playstation expert like some people out there that love this game, but if you are looking for a fairly easy game evolving into a challenging one, this game is not for you. Unfortunately, I took the game back. But I did exchange it for other Crash Bandicoot games, and I am happy. I hope I was helpful."
3,i played this game at a cousins house,i played this game at a cousins house but i dont play games as long as i use to any more i love the level when i play as his sister and ride a tiger
4,The best! But hard.,This game was really good even though I didn't beat all of it. I love all the Coco levels (favoring the china ones! Pura is SO cute!) This game has alot of freaky mindboggeling levels. I recomend it to any expert PS player.
5,A typical Crash Bandicoot game with excellent graphics.,"The lucrative phrase ""free-roaming levels"" is a misnomer...Crash is still VERY limited as to where he can explore; however, there is a little more variety since Crash & Koko can ride different vehicles (a la Tomb Raider II & III). The graphics are definite eye-candy and the bosses (fortunately) seem to be a little tougher. Also, the game gives you different goals to accomplish so if you want perfection, Crash: Warped has more playability than the other 2 games. If you are a fan of Crash or platform-type games, this is a definite must have!"
4,"Good, but too ""kiddie""","Awesome graphics, good gameplay, but this game was too juvenile and stupid for my tastes. Too much effort went into making Crash Bandicoot and the villains in this game comical and ""wacky."" The result is really annoying. The cutscenes with the stupid American cartoon voices were the worst part. Normally I am not against ""cutesy"" games but this one just annoyed me."
4,A must-read for every potential freelancer!,"I bought this book hoping it would answer a lot of my questions about freelancing. I am pleased to report that it did. This book is well thought out and organized. I only wish it would discuss a little more about the financial aspects of freelancing (i.e., where to put the money for maximum benefit after you make it!)"
5,sexy splash,"Love the A custom line, but especially the shimmer and quickness of this splash...very nice and quick, it is great for any type of music!"
4,Excelent!!!,"It's a good watch, but if you're going to buy an automatic watch, don't forget the winder."
5,Good value for your money!,"Having recently purchased this watch for an every day wear, I am impressed with its appearance. I get at least one positive comment daily on this watch."
5,none better,"Danu is one of the most talented, grounded groups there is. these young folks play and sing like they've been doing this for 100 years! it's just in every fiber of their being. it's in their blood and memory. these cuts let you hear the instruments in their purest form- it's beautiful."
3,Danu's Up in the Air,Up in the Air focuses on each band member. Great to complete a Danu collection.
2,not a happy camper,"Bought a New George Forman, Could find the one Like I had, which i Liked, but all the Teflon came off after 3 years..So bought this one the Teflon is great, but it burns burgers on half and way under cooked on other side, grease drips past this new kind of tray...the old design was better, but needed a new kind of Teflon coating...I gave it 2 stars because it cooks half of burger, then have to rotate it"
3,"Quality machine, but small and hard to clean","This grill is very well made and sturdy. It heats quickly and grills just as it should. However, the back hinge does not allow for thicker pieces of meat so you end up getting a piece of meat that is over cooked at the back of the grill and under cooked at the front of the grill. Also, the grill plates do not come out so you have to find a way to clean the grilling surface without getting the rest of the machine wet. Most importantly, this machine's grilling surface is only large enough to fit one medium sized filet or chicken breast at a time. Buying a slightly larger machine with removable grilling plates would solved most, if not all, of this problems.Foreman makes a good machine. it seems that it will not break easily."
4,George Foreman GR11WSP3 Champ Electric Grill is great,I was once again very pleased with this just large enought for the two of us grill. This is our 4th one and have valued each one of them.
2,just doesn't get the job done right,It could stand some redesigning and quality control in the manufacturing process. El cheapo!
5,Love it!,"I live on my own and don't generally cook much and generally have avoided cooking meat at home at all, but this little grill has made it so easy! It's small so it stores easily, yet it easily cooks one or two chicken breasts, burgers or small steaks, so is perfect for one or two people. It cooks everything easily and I never worry that the food is over or under done. It is also easy to clean--just wipe it with a damp sponge and dry it off and it's ready to go for the next use!"
1,Customer support,No response from consumer support. Amazon list as Mac compatible but box does not. Just wanted clarification because I have a Mac.
4,Comfy!,"They provide enough comfort for my feet but are slim enough to use on dress shoes and boots, although I would replace them every month or two."
3,Doesn't quite work on audio,"Franken's ""Stuart Smalley"" is probably his most brilliant character, and the short bits on SNL are absolute classics. But somehow it falls flat on tape without the visuals and Francken's mugging.Perhaps those who are more intimately familiar with the self-help culture will find it funnier. For me, it seemed somewhat lifeless."
5,Great product for a great price!,"After doing research on which brand of pressure cooker I should buy, fagor had been on my lists to buy. After searching online, and reading the reviews, I purchased this set since it was a perfect size and the price was just right. I am so glad that I got these, and have used it almost everyday! Cooking brown rice in the 4qt comes out perfectly, in 20mins, and I'm also experimenting with more recipes! Just recently I cooked frozen chicken thighs, for my soy sauce chicken, and it took 16 mins for the dish to be ready!"
3,I wish they had shown the inside cover in the pictures,"This is a very nice notebook. I bought a few to write memory books for each of my three boys, and therefore was hoping that it would be presentable on the outside as well as the inside. The outside is perfect, but the inside cover is a blueline advertisement, and quite unattractive. I will try and submit my own customer image so you can see it yourself and decide whether you would like to look at it every time you open the book or not. The other things I dislike about the notebook are the words ""Date"" on every upper right corner and ""Page"" on every lower right corner. I would prefer something cleaner, and therefore, I will be returning the product."
4,"Great Notebook, a few things to consider","Loved the notebook overall. I originally bought the notebook because I liked the idea of the tabs that I could use to organize it into sections. Where this fails is that when you tear out the labels (via the pre-perforated line) it leaves about 1/32 of a page which is of a higher gauge paper. This causes the notebook to have a hard time being held open at first. After that, it kind of becomes an annoyance for folding pages in half and putting them into the notebook like a folder. The Blueline advertisements and self-love write-ups on the inside get a little tiring as well. Also, any medium nib fountain pen users out there might be a little careful when purchasing this notebook. Using Noodler's Sequoia Green it is not possible to write on both sides of the page without making both sides unreadable. This is possible with AT Cross ballpoints and Pilot G2 07. Works great with both. Would highly recommend otherwise."
2,OK but not too sturdy,"I think all products like this depend on how you use them. I keep my notebook open on my desk all day taking notes and flipping back and forth from prior notes.For this use the cons are:* Thin cover bows and won't close flat after weeks of use.* The pages are thin and the corners roll up and fold over with repeated use.* Date and Page tags on each page are wasted space for me.* I would prefer 8""x10"" size instead of the 7.25"" by 9.25""For me the Pros are:* Paper is nice to write on with Zebra Sarsa 0.7mm black. No bleed through.* Ruling is about 7mm per line which is ok for me."
4,well worth the moeny,"Well worth the money. Only drawback is that 96 pages make it look kind of thin. I would have opted for something around 200 pages. Also, the label sheet is great but put this in the end and not the first page."
1,Poor quality rip-off of Heinlein,"This book is a repititious account of thousands of ships blasting thousands of ships with little detail or tactical considerations, interspersed with Admirals pontificating on their noble self-sacrifice.At times there are sections that are nearly word-for-word copies from Heinlein's Starship Troopers.I enjoyed 'Crusade' and 'Insurrection' from the authors, but this entry is simply awful filler."
5,FANTASTIC,"I READ THIS BOOKS ABOUT 2 YEARS AGO,SINCE THEN I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR SEQUEL.I RECENTLY EMAILED PUBLISHER(Though we have no release date for it, David Weber & STeve White have started working on the sequel tentatively titled, The Shiva Option.)THAT' S info, I GOT FROM BEAN BOOKS (UPDATE 7/10/2001) BOOK OUT BY EARLY 2002 PER PUBLISHER."
4,"Good fast paced story, but needs a sequel","Not much to add to the other reviews but having read this book for the third time I found the story just as interesting as the first time. I also find myself waiting for the next book in the series. However, I am afraid this may not happen as two years have passed since In Death Ground came out."
4,Exellent,"Great book, on the order of crusade and Insurection. I was disapointed in the ending, IT JUST ENDED. Where is the rest of the book?"
5,Space combat gallore,"Mr. Weber did not mind killing off main characters in this book. I like that. It gives the story a more realistic feel. I feel sorry for the humans and their allies in this novel. The bug's R & D department is vastly superior to the good guy's. Soon (in two years at most), the bugs would even up the battle technology field then overwhelm them with superior numbers. I wonder how or if the good guys can win faced with such a daunting opponent. I agree with the other reviewers. This novel begs for a sequel! If Mr. Weber is reading this, please write the sequel soon, and I wouldn't mind it at all if the sequel is longer and contained more furious combat than this novel."
3,not the best,"Weber & White like to make things explode. If you like lots of explosions, you'll like this book. If you like telegraphed plot turns (see page 459 for an absolutely classic example of Famous Last Words, just for one example) you'll like this book.It'll do for light reading. People looking for serious work should look elsewhere."
5,The penultimate space opera,This is the space adventure that puts all others to shame. I have waited decades for a decent space movie in vain and finally found the perfect science fiction adventure in a book. This book rocks!
4,"Not a bad book, but not the best of Weber either","The universe of the Federation always makes for an enjoyable read, but in this book, Weber makes (for the first time since I've been reading him) the mistake of thinking that bigger is better. 'In Death Ground' reads like a laundry list of battles, with no intimacy. It's hard to feel in the middle of a battle with thousands of ships, and Weber just keeps adding more to each chapter. By contrast, the final battle between only two ships in Weber's 'On Basilisk Station' is one of the finest ever written. To Weber - give up on the big stuff, or write it from a more involved perspective. To the reader - It's worth reading, but not the right introduction to this fine writer. If you've never read Weber, go buy 'Crusade' or 'On Basilisk Station' instead."
4,Not Bad But...,I read the book and found almost in the same vein as Starhip Troopers. Except that these Bugs are of the space traveling kind. The problem that I had with the book is that you really never get to know the Bugs. I guess the next book will deal with contacting and communicating with them.
2,Copy of Heinlein,"A good space opera IF you are familiar with the Starfire game series, which has great appeal if you are an accountant. At times gripping, the characters are often shallow and the rip-offs from Robert Heinlein's ""Starship Troopers"" (soon to be released as a motion picture, what timing!) are nearly word for word. Excellent if you like varied descriptions of nuclear detonations"
4,The sequel! I want the sequel!,"I loved this book and I just could not stop reading it, but... the book finishes just in the middle of the war and there was no warning of that. It has been three years since the authors wrote it: when shall we read the sequel?!"
1,flameless pillar candles - do not work - very unsatisfactory,"I purchased 2 sets of candles and neither worked - the company Pier87 was very apologetic and resent the order however the replacement order was incorrect and also did not work. I was given a full refund courtesy of a very helpful customer service person at the company, however it took several phone calls and emails to get the UPS return labels and then they only sent one although I had 2 packages.I would definitely not recommend these candles"
2,return policy,"Unfortunately, I do not recommend this e-retailer because their return policy is worthless. While I understand the need to charge the customer for shipping fees, I do not feel that a restocking fee for 3 small candles (we're not about talking about large or oversized items here!) makes sense."
1,hoooorrible music !,"this was the worst album i have ever baught! this man cannot sing for anything. and the album was dreary and sad to listen to. i ended up throwing it out of my car window the same day. what a shame. who gives people like these record contracts? anyway, i wouldn't give this album to my worst enemy.jim baron's music is something that you would torcher people with. yuck yuck yuck. hey people take my suggesstion, if you wanna be entertained,then don't buy this album. if you wanna send yourself to the graveyard early then by it."
1,Hard book to read,I had to read this to help my son and this was one of the worst and hardest books to read. I didn't see the educational value in assigning this book when it was a very hard book to retain. I would not recommend this book.
1,breaks easily,"My cats love the sticky hand but it is made out of a cheap, Chinese copy of Sorbothane. Yes, it is made to stick to things, but the thin rubber cord isn't strong enough. It breaks easily. One of them snapped in 5 minutes."
2,Best Ever Treats,These freeze-dried liver treats from Pooch Passions are the best ever. My little Shih Tzu and Lhaso Apso love the flavor and texture. They race to their beds at the end of the day to get Pooch Passions treats. (I used Gimborn beef liver treats and wasn't satisfied with them. I even wrote the company when the quality of the treats deteriorated and over half of a bucket would be unusable.) The quality of Pooch Passions Liver Treats is consistently high. These Pooch Passions treats can be cut in half for tiny little guys like mine. I'm 100% satisfied and recommend these without reservation. Pet test them yourself with your dog and you'll soon be buying them in the large 21 ounce bags as I do. BEST EVER TREATS!!!!
5,dogs love it,"Our dogs love this dried liver and it is hard to find, we were thrilled to find it and to buy enough to get it shipped for free. Can't say we have tried it as it is pet food but our dogs love it."
2,Offensive to Southerners,"As an Atlanta native, I found the first 150 pages so boring and offensive I returned the book to the library. The attempt to replicate the southern dialect was boring and tedious to read. Atlanta is a very cross cultural town and very few individuals carry on as Wolfe implies.With books like this written about the South, no wonder everyone else in the world thinks of us as uneducated wilting magnolias with nothing on our minds but what we are going to wear to the next ball! This ain't Tara, Scarlett. Wolfe needs to return to his roots and ingest what the South is in 1999."
4,Almost Historic,"Moments ago, I finished Wolfe's latest work of fiction, a book filled with great characters, wonderful narrative, and many--many--pages.After reading the last three chapters just this hour, appears that the author decided to write ""only"" a great book. This was discouraging because.........If Wolfe had turned the last three chapters into 200 more pages of well-developed plot lines and logical conclusions, this work could have been THE GREATEST NOVEL IN AMERICAN LITERARY HISTORY.Who cares about the National Book Award when you can own history????"
1,I'm going to kill the member of my book group who chose this,"I never would have finished this piece of drivel if I didn't have to discuss it with my book group this Sunday! I always joke that I never buy a book with an embossed cover. Now I'll add ""or with a die cut jacket"". I've never read Wolfe and will never do so again. There were some kernels of interest but I was insulted by his assumption that I need help understanding his prose. Add to that the never ending descriptions that seem to be there so the costume designer of a forthcoming movie will know exactly how to dress his cardboard characters, and you have a disaster that doesn't even have the good grace to have a reasonable ending.I love long books and I treasure description but this book is a joke! A very bad joke. Shame on you FSG."
1,Gross,"I had read good reviews of this book in Amazon.Com so I thought it would be good. What a surprise to find it an exact reflection of all that I don't like about our society and choose not to focus on. Violence, cruelty, ignorance, and boredom await you in this sorry tome."
3,amethyst ring,"It is a very nice ring, but the amethyst stone looked brighter in the pictures online. I was expecting a very purple stone, but it is rather translucent. Overall I am satisfied, but I wish the stone was darker"
5,Joyita de libro,"Este libro es una verdadera joyita. Desde que compré el primer ejemplar en una librería en mi país (la Filosófica de Caracas) no dejé de seguir comprándolo para regalárselo a mis amigos, especialmente a los que sólo creen ""en lo que dice la Iglesia"". El tratamiento que Emmet Fox le da a estos temas es tan excelso... que no dudo que haya más de un cura por ahí basando sus sermones en este material!Mucho lamenté cuando, por la situación actual en mi país, este libro dejó de estar disponible a los venezolanos. Con inmensa alegría recibí la noticia de que ahora está disponible AL MUNDO ENTERO a través de Amazon!"
3,Good book...for beginners,"If you already max out your 401K plan, pay yourself first by investing regularly and already have investment in stocks, you will not find much new information in this book. As other reviewers, I would have given it five stars if I were a total rookie to investments. One book I found very inspirational is Rich Dad's Guide to Investing, which take the ""get rich"" subject to higher levels, including that of entrepreneurship and IPO."
3,Step #1 &#65533; Subscribe to my newsletters.,"No, it was not that obvious, but throughout the book the author keeps on referring to the newsletters that he publishes, which by the end becomes very annoying. Overall a good book for a beginning investor. I found a big number of good points. One of them was against day-trading, where the author suggests that if an investor jumps out of the stock with a 50% gain, he or she will miss a possible 1,000% gain.Also, the respondents' comments were quite inspiring. On the negative side, Carlson attempted to provide information on some of the DRiP's, which is very time-based and will become obsolete very soon.Do not expect this book to replace Millionaire Next Door."
5,This book is a good investment!,"This book shows you how to achieve millionaire status without having to tie up all your time and money in your own business. You don't have to spend a lot of time implementing these steps. Just forget about asset allocation, stay 100% in stocks during your earning years (and maybe after), and pick good stocks and stay with them. These steps are clearly laid out. If a person follows them, she will be successful. The author printed several interviews with successful investors to show how the steps work for them. They also show you how you can tailor the steps to suit your personal style. I think this approach makes sense for at least part of your portfolio. It'll also make it easier to sleep when the Nasdaq plunges on the latest Fed tightening."
5,Highly Recommended!,"One hundred and seventy millionaires can't be wrong, can they? Probably not. That's why you should pay close attention to the simple wisdom of Charles B. Carlson's book, which analyzes the investment habits of 170 members of the seven-figure club. The results: Millionaire investors buy fundamentally strong stocks, pay little attention to market timing, never trade on news and maintain a dedicated buy-and-hold philosophy. Carlson straightforwardly presents these financial principles for a financially unsophisticated audience, complete with lists of organizations and companies to contact for further investment information. Profiles and examples of successful investors like Warren Buffett will keep you hooked, even if you tend to nod off at the first mention of a PE ratio. We [...] strongly recommend this book for its unintimidating style and logical methodology."
4,Some Good Advice for Everyone,I was intrigued by this book. I found it interesting and informative. Plus the millionare bios at the end of each chapter were very interesting. I just wish that more information had been supplied surrounding the methodology and raw data found in the survey that was used as support for some of the basic philosophies.
1,There's a word for this.,"It's called ""post hoc ergo propter hoc,"" and it's an example of the fallacy of believing that things are the way they are because they're supposed to be this way, when they're really this way only because they can be this way and they don't happen to be any other way.The fact is, in any population of tens of millions of investors, many will go broke, but many will get rich, due to simple random-walk statistics applied to random fluctuations of the markets.The best ten bucks you make this year may be the ten you keep by not buying this book."
4,Practical advice,"This book is practical, easily understood, well written advice on accumulating money. Many of the steps and tips are simple and common sense, but it is helpful to have them all in one place to teach or remind one of how simple it is to accumulate a large amount of wealth. For most people, our greatest difficulty is ourselves. It requires disciple and restraint to cut back today to have tomorrow. As we follow these steps, it becomes easier and easier to build net worth."
1,"No news here, just repeats information from other books","Nothing original or new in this book. These stories have been told better in books (specifically The Millionaire Next Door). Only one person will make seven figures from this book and that's the author. If you want to become wealthy, pay off your credit card debt, max out your 401(k) and invest in some good mutual funds instead."
3,Not Bad but...,"Not great, either. Some of the advice will be sound for some readers but NOT ALL and some of the information useful to most readers. This is a book for investors of below-average knowledge but useful to remind the reader that there are ways to screw up your finances that are not financial, per se.Still, an interesting read but this shouldn't be the only book on managing your finances and investing that you read.WR Curiel, author ofThe Debt Whisperer"
5,MACH 3 TURBO!,"I love these razors. They are cheaper than the Fusion Blades, and give me a very close shave without any razor burn."
5,THE BEST SO FAR!,"How long must we wait for the next one? Don't take a vacation Ms. Peters, I'm on the edge of my seat!"
4,Excellent reading,"I have read quite a few of the Amelia Peabody mysteries, and I have enjoyed them thoroughly. But this book is the best by far. I am so glad that the book focused more on the young people Nefret, Ramses, and David than just the adults. I hope this trend will continue in later books."
3,Not quite up to par.,"I love the Amelia Peabody novels by Ms Peters. I hope she writes at least 20 more Peabody novels. BUT this one wasn't quite as charming or quite as funny as the previous novels. Everyone seems to blame Nefret but I think she is o.k. I think Ramses needs to be a bit more like his younger self, more outspoken and outrageous. And Amelia needs to get back more of the old spunk. Anyway, I still enjoyed this and will continue to read this series, just didn't enjoy it as much as the earlier novels. And I still hope that one day when I'm visiting Frederick I will have the pleasure of meeting the author."
4,A Wonderful Rendition of Egyptian Mystery!,"Seeing A Large Cat was Elizabeth Peters at her best. The book is truly intriguing and quickly draws you in- I couldn't put the book down!. The annual excavation trip to Egypt looks to be pretty boring exploring non-noble already discovered tombs in the Valley of the Kings. But knowing Amelia, something is bound to happen- and it did! A 15 year old mummy in a ""new"" tomb, dangers galore, and a long list of exciting suspects forms the basis for this excellent Amelia Peabody mystery. Good Gad, you've just got to read it!"
1,Blah and bah,"This series has lost its spunk and spice. The adventures of Amelia, Emerson and Ramses were a favorite, and I looked forward to seeing how Ramses developed as he aged. I usually don't like series that add a kid for who knows what reason, but, brat that he was, Ramses sseemed to fit. I envisioned many more great reads. Unfortunately, Peters ran out of steam with the stupidity of the mythical land that Nefret came from. Please! Nefret has been a major drag. She is nothing more than an eraser smudging and draining the life from the Emersons. ""Cat"" is a hodgepodge of unreasoned stew. I will give the series another opportunity, but, probably, not more than one."
1,Such a bore,"The mystery was boring, the characters tedious, and continually having events re-examined from someone else's point of view was a yawn. Why has a mummy in silk underwear been brought to the Emerson family's attention? What is the connection with the mysterious American millionaire and his man-eating daughter? By the end, I didn't much care.The Peabody novels have been going downhill as the series progresses, and I think the essential reason is that the author loves her main characters, the Emerson family, too much. They are perfect by default, no matter how reprehensible or stupid their behaviour, because they are the main characters and her beloved creations - it is only others who can be at fault. Rarely does anything truly bad ever happen to them, and if it does it is because of their ""virtue"" and ""nobility""."
5,Excellent book,"All the Amelia Peabody books are first rate books and this one does not disappoint. Amelia Peabody against all odds carries on an excavation, thwarts the villain, and keeps her family from certain doom."
2,I don't believe I finish this book,"If you think that in this book you will read something interesting about the ancient Egypt, you are completely wrong, the main story of the book is the diary of Amelia Peabody, but I don't think that if someone writes a diary will write what think another person, you can't do that, you just don't know what others think.Basically the book is the story of an assassin who killed his wife ten years or so before this story, it really is boring and boring."
3,good book,"Yes, I was required to read this book as a World History Project. I found it semi-hard to read becuse the characters. The characters were very hard to tell how they were related to the main character, Amelia Peabody. I also picked a book sounds like it was in a series of books, so I picked a hard book to start out on. It was a little hard to start out in the beginning but after getting through the first chapter it got much better. I thought overall from reading other summaries and the readers opinions I liked the book."
4,Very good,"This stand holds my rather heavy casio 88-key piano, but is far more portable and far lighter than the stand that comes with thie instrument. It was easy to put together, and the color-coded stickers on the product were very helpful. It is quite sturdy, and I felt confident putting the instrument on it.But the x of the stand is awkward when you sit down. I have long legs, so it was not as big a problem for me, but when another keyboardist went to use the stand, he had to sit too far away from it (so his knees could avoid hitting it), and he ended up being very stretched out as he tried to play. This also makes using a pedal far more of a chore than it should be. That's why the product recieved 4 stars instead of 5."
5,Worth the extra price,"I got this because of the easy clutch release since I would be transporting this stand frequently. Works like a charm, adjusts to whatever height I want so easily, and is nice and sturdy. Only downside is the little rubber feet sometimes come off. I just stick'em back on..."
3,not is stable in a small keyboard,"is secured with screws so it get to loose, only recomended for the heaviest keyboards because in a small one don get secure"
4,"pain to assemble due to bad instructions, but would buy again","It took several attempts to assemble it properly over the course of about 30 minutes maximum, but the product is solid, sturdy and stable. Would definitely purchase again."
5,great video,great fantastic brought back memories i got it for my 18 year old to watch and she even liked it
4,Just what I remember,Good shipping. Nice to watch what I remembered from a very long time ago. Amazing to see how technology changes; this was pretty amazing at the time.
3,"Claymation Christmas is Great, the others...","I really enjoy Claymation Christmas. With that said, I never remembered seeing the Halloween and Easter programs, and I wish that I had never watched them on this DVD. They're nothing like the Christmas program.Even if I had enjoyed all three programs, I don't think the price should be more than $10 for this product. The quality is terrible because nothing was remastered, and the running time of all shows is only about an hour. I don't know how they came up with the price on this one.Regardless, I don't know of any other legal way to acquire this program unless you're able to buy a used copy, and I can't say that I expected really great quality. So, if you're a fan, try to get it used. If you can't get it used, $20 won't usually break the bank, but I don't know if I'd buy it at that price again."
5,A Priceless Holiday Gem!,"Claymation Christmas is worthy to join the pantheon of holiday entertainment classics! From a creative standpoint, it is nearly peerless in its ability to generate WOW! moments, such is the level of creative brilliance behind the presentation of Claymation Christmas' various vignettes. And, if one has an appreciation for the dedication and demands in producing stop action animation, then certainly CC can be appreciated on that level, as well. Will Vinton & Co., the creative masterminds behind Claymation Christmas, have indeed produced and bequeathed to us a Treasure!Not to be missed, Oh fans of Holiday fare. Now get thee a copy and marvel at the mastery that is Claymation Christmas!"
3,Superb and Awful,"Contains three shows. I bought it for the Christmas special, which I absolutely love. The Halloween and Easter episodes are nasty, in my opinion, but not that different from some of the other Halloween type shows I've seen, so I'm sure plenty of folks probably would enjoy them. The purchase is worth it to me for just the one episode that I love. The Christmas episode is a delight to young and old."
1,Awful,"The christmas special was very good and I really enjoyed it and sharing it with my Kids and Grandkids. It was something that I had on video and enjoyed for years since it's initial airing. But even the younst of my kids could not watch the holloween and Easter specials. No wonder I had not heard of them, horrible. THey were a mess of pointless plot and poor graphics. Awful. Do not buy this."
2,Will Vinton's Claymation Holiday DVD,"I expected this DVD to be primarily of the ""California Raisins,"" which is what I typed in on the Amazon search engine prior to finding this DVD. It was not. It was of Clamation characters. As I searched through the three videos on the DVD, I never found the California Raisins, although they may have had a minor feature role. Very dissappointing if you're a California Raisins fan."
4,Loved it,I loved the Christmas one as a kid. I'd never seen the Halloween or Easter. The Halloween it hillarious but the Easte is a little wierd. It's still one I'll watch every year.
4,clamation christmas,"The Halloween and Easter part is sort of stupid, but all that is out weighed by the Christmas edition. I loved the Christmas show as a child and still love it as an adult!! I highly recommend this Christmas story for adults with children. Heck if you don't have kids buy it, it's hillarious!!!"
5,Will Ventons Claymation Christmas Plus Halloween & Easter Celebrations,When I was a kid it was an annual event to sit around the tv and watch the Christmas Claymation. I missed this show and was more than excited to find this on DVD. I actually bought 3 sets so I could give a couple as gifts to my family.
5,A Wonderful Classic Christmas Memory,"I remember when this Christmas special first aired on television back in 1987. I fell in love with the beautiful songs and amazing colorful backgrounds. Now that I own this Chritmas classic on DVD, I can relive those special memories over and over again. Be sure to get this to add to your own special collection to enjoy with your family, friends or just to yourself. It will make you feel like being a little kid again."
5,A Childhood Gem,"The Christmas special is even better then I remember and with the Halloween and Easter specials added on top of it, this is a wonderful way to relive a bit of your childhood and share with the children in your life."
5,childhood memories!,haven't seen this in many years!! so glad I found it on Amazon! It came in a timely manner and was in great condition! It was so great to watch this all over again and still remember it like it was on tv just yesterday! Thank you and keep up the great work!
5,I look forward to watching this every Christmas,"I love this claymation video! It's full of Christmas songs and carols sung by fun claymation characters. ""The Carol of the Bells"" led by Quasimodo is hilarious, and you'll be tapping your feet to ""We Three Kings"" sung by three camels. Two dinosaurs host the show and they are really fun to watch. Fun for all ages!"
5,The only Christmas special I've ever loved,"I am dreading the next format shift, because there's no way I ever want to part with this Christmas special again. Rex and Herb! Margot Pontoon and Rudolf Nerves-on-edge! We finally find out the meaning of the word wassail, and, yes, it has something to do with snacks. Kinda."
4,Claymation Christmas,I was so excited to get this DVD. It used to be a favorite of mine when I was a child. It was in great condition. Thanks for the quick shipment and product.
5,fun!,"Our kids grew up watching this video multiple times. Years later we enjoy it even more, and appreciate the artists' work with a new eye. Very entertaining!"
4,Christmas,"The Christmas dvd is tremendous and well worth the price. The easter and Halloween dvds are not so good but since they come together, you can watch the Christmas one over and over again and just let the other 2 gather dust somewhere!!!"
4,makes me remeber being a kid,"I used to watch the christmas special with my brother and sister when we were little so I bought it to watch it with my 3 year old son. He didn't like it so much (not sure if it was due to his age or what), but i enjoyed it still"
4,Bought it for the Christmas special,I was not a big fan of the Easter or Halloween specials. The Christmas one is awesome though.Reminds me of childhood.
4,Excellent family classic.,"My family has always loved the Claymation Christmas movie, and it has become somewhat of a tradition to watch our recorded copy of the movie each year. Unfortunately, the copy is quite old and has deteriorated greatly, so it has become increasingly difficult to watch the movie each year. Now that we have this classic on DVD, our tradition can live on for many years to come and delight future generations!"
4,just like I remembered when is was released,"I had video taped this from TV back when,and when I saw it was available on DVD I had to get it.I will say the Christmas show was why I bought it.Just love those California Raisins.I had not seen the Holloween or Easter shows so I was curious to check them out.I was slightly disappointed in the Halloween show,and The Easter show is fine.If you collect video's, you might want to skip on this unless you just have to have it."
3,My thoughts.,The package came in good time. The movie was sealed up and never been used. I think that it is a little pricey for what it is though. I just wanted the Christmas special so I paid for it. I really think that this item is over priced and the shipping was a bit much for an envelope mailer. But overall I'm okay with this product.
3,Great Animation,"I have always loved the art work of Will Vinton. I loved the Christmas special since I first saw it in the eighties. The other two stories on this disk are kind of lame, but buying the dvd is worth it just for the Will Vinton Christmas."
3,Love The Claymation / Poor Quality,I was really bummed about this purchase. Our video of the Claymation Christmas was dying and the video quality was very poor. Plus our video player is on its way out the door. Sadly it appears that someone ripped the DVD from a video tape rather than a master from Will Vinton Studios.
2,Quality,The quality of the movie was not that clear. It look as if they copied it from a really old tape that was kind of messed up. Some parts would look real fuzzy.
5,One of the best,This has been a favorite in my family for years. It's a fun video to watch over and over. I'm so glad it's back in print - I jumped through hoops ten years ago trying to find it!! Get this - you won't be sorry!!
3,"Great Christmas Special, sub-par DVD","If you are a fan of the Claymation Christmas special and want a copy of it on DVD (seeing as it gets very little if any playtime during December now days), then this is a great DVD to have. Unfortunately, it includes the Halloween and Easter specials which are nowhere even close to the same quality as the Christmas special. If you're purchasing this expecting to get 3 quality shows on 1 DVD, don't waste your time. This purchases should be made strictly based on whether or not you like the Christmas special."
3,One third great,"The Claymation Christmas video is great, but the other two (Halloween and Easter) are absolutely horrible! The Christmas video has great songs, is humorous, and ideal for kids of all ages. The Halloween and Easter video aren't funny, aren't well made, and are so bad it was actually embarassing to watch them.5 stars for Christmas, 1 star for Halloween, 2 stars for Easter -- that averages out to a slightly less than 3."
3,"Good show, bad DVD","I purchased the Will Vinton's Claymation Christmas DVD for my wife, and while she was happy to be able to see the show again, the DVD was disappointing.I can understand the video and audio being a bit weak since older, ""made-for-TV"" show, and there was no remastering involved, but they didn't even bother to make the audio the same level between the three shows (it includes a Halloween and Easter show). I think it was in the Easter show, the audio fades in and out between loud and barely audible."
4,A little clay slab of nostalgia,"For those fans of classic 80's nostalgia or those who enjoy unique animation, this is definitely worth checking out. The Christmas special is certainly the best of the bunch, featuring an absolute must-hear version of the California Raisins doing ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"".When I put this in, I was the only one watching it. By the time it was halfway through, the entire family was all engrossed and enthused. Very fun stuff."
5,Rare find & awesome DVD,"I have not been able to find this old Christmas special in a good while. The old VHS we recorded of it was basically destroyed over the years and have been looking for a DVD of it for quite some time. Its a little pricey for a DVD but seeing as not many if any other merchants carry this its well worth it. Its a good deal too because it has the Christmas, Easter, and Halloween specials. If you saw this back in the late 80s early 90s on CBS and loved it and miss it, this is your chance at having it on hand for your holiday viewing pleasure and for nostalgia's sake."
5,A Christmas Classic!,"I am SO glad I found this!!! When I was a lad, we'd watch this for a few Christmas' in a row... then it dissapeared. Thanks to Amazon, I've got it and have just loved it!! It's not Christmas without it- featuring the ""Bellharmonic Orchestra"" ... ""Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer"" in a cool 60's style and the best arrangement of ""Joy to the World"" I've come across! ""We Three Kings"" still steals the show!"
4,Claymation Christmas,"I had seen the claymation Christmas special years ago once on TV. I never saw it repeated. I had enjoyed it enough to order the video. While it is a secular special, it is not ashamed to have clearly religious carols as part of it. Excellent video."
5,Feel good fun.,"My kids and I love this CD, and we've had it for a couple years now! It's timeless with pretty, beachy feeling music. Can't miss for a drive to the beach, or a fun day soundtrack."
4,A lot of Fun,The lilo and stitch soundtracks are a lot of fun for grownups and kids to listen to together. Not as good as the first but very fun.
5,great for kids luau,Had a luau for my son's 5th birthday. The music was great and the kids just loved it. Made the party a hit!
4,Great Buy,"Everyone should have this book in their personal library. Whether its difficult issues at the job, within friendships or relationships, Difficult Conversations: How to Discuss what Matters Most will assist in your approach to resolving those critical issues in your life: great book."
3,Sort of mid range,Moderatly satisfying can take to long to make point and would benefit from bit more investigation of why what works works. Ok read but you will need other sources to really understand at the levle of what should you do as situations vary.
3,A Difficult Book to understand!,"I don't know if it was that the book was not well written, or just that the thoughts seemed disjointed, but I had a very difficult time following the ideas. First of all, it is really hard to digest the fact that I may be at fault for all of the issues I need to have difficult conversations about. This book would have us all believing that we should not only always look at the other person's side, but often sacrifice our own views and desires in the interest of making a difficult conversation easier. Secondly, I am sure there must be a better approach than this. I had to strongly disagree on many occasions with the author's recommendations because when I applied them to my own life, I found myself having to make excuses for wrongdoings that others did to me! Definitely not for people with low self-esteem!"
4,well written,"I read ""Getting to Yes"" by the same authors and found this just as well written. The only reason for loosing a star was that I found it somewhat thin on substance and somewhat repetitive from ""getting to yes"". But it is well structured and their analysis is on the ball."
5,Great resource for coaches,"Being a new corporate coach, I am always looking for resources to use and share with clients. This book has proven to be a very valuable reference personally and professionally. In fact it is becoming somewhat dog-eared from use. The insights and models have been useful for my (sometimes difficult)conversations with clients. Additionally, I share the techniques with clients and ask questions based on the book to help guide the client's development with having better conversations. Conversations are at the heart of all relationships, and are often overlooked in leadership development. For those who are ready to make some significant shifts in their leadership and relationship skills, or help others do so, this book is a great tool."
5,Very Helpful!,"I didn't think there was any help for my difficult conversatons, so I was surprised to find this informations so thorough and helpful. The material is very well organized. ""Difficult Conversations"" gave me real, practical strategies that have made a big difference in my ease in bringing up tricky conversations and working through them with positive results. Everyone in my family has agreed to listen to the audio program, which will be a big help in our communication. I highly recommend it."
2,Warmed Over Cognitive Therapy and Action Science,This is watered down Action Science material a la Argyris for the general public. Just another book length marketing brochure for several drop-out consultants from the Harvard Negotiation Project--shameless self-promotion.
5,The best available book on workplace communications.,"I use the concepts presented in this book every week in conflict resolution sessions in the workplace. Every person involved in any difficult relationship at work, at home, at play (who isn't?) would benefit from a thorough study of this book."
3,audio needs better narration...,"I have the audio version. While I like the message of the book, the audio cd needs work. The speakers are boring speakers and hard to keep interested in listening. There's like 2 male voices and 1-2 female voices. Keeps jumping around."
4,Recommended by a teacher in a How to Deal with Difficult Personalities,I've lent it out before I have read it but am looking forward to reading this as soon as I get it back. The teacher said of the entire book list 20+ - this was the most important book to get.
2,I've seen better books,"I think this is a very important topic that definitely needs to be addressed. I think the authors do a good job, but I do have a few problems with the book. Although I can learn how to overcome conflicts, I still feel like conflict is approached as a problem. I recently picked up another book on this subject: The Coward's Guide to Conflict by Tim Ursiny. I loved Coward's Guide because it approached conflict as an opportunity, which I think is a tremendously positive outlook. Staying positive is one of the greatest challenges in dealing with conflict."
2,Impractical. Over complicated!,"Despite the overwhelmingly positive reviews here on Amazon, I really cant appreciate the value, usefulness or practicality of this book. The proposed framework, that each difficult conversation is really three (The ""What Happened?"", The ""Feelings"" and The ""Identity"") Conversations, is complicating rather than helping to solve the problem. You may think I am a contrarian or a poor communicator. However, with my very positive experience (and reviews) on books like ""How to win friends and influence people?"" by Dale Calegie, ""Get anyone to do anything and never feel powerless again"" by David J. Lieberman , ""How to talk to anyone?"" by Leil Lowndes and so on, I am obliged to warn potential buyers, in particular regular readers of relevant books, of a big disappointment."
3,Good but not the best advice on the subject,Ordinary. Okay ... not what I was hoping for in terms of strategies. Seems to retain victimhood and lack of ownership on the part of the one who has taken offense.
4,Difficult Conversations,"I received the book later than I expected, but the quality of the book was not bad for the price I paid for."
2,kindle price more than paperback,"Kindle price more than paperback ?curious how these are prices are being set.I bought more ebooks, and none paperbacks.i guess ebooks could be priced more than paper copies, except that i cant resell ebooks."
3,Some good points,I bought this book for my daughter but I skimmed it before I gave it to her. Has good points .
5,The steps work,"This was an instructional book for a class I took on mediation and negociation. It was immensely helpful! By practicing the steps and working them into a variety of scenarios, the reader can begin to see success in their communication."
4,hand percussion,"....this is a reasonably priced wood agogo/guiro. it would be preferred to play several to find 'the one' with good tone. as is, the smaller side tone is deader than the lrg side.drill a 3/8 hole and add to your percussion tree....."
2,A Dissenting Opinion,"I adore Georgette Heyer and snapped this one up with much anticipatory glee. At last, I thought, someone will give this author the respect and scholarly attention she has long deserved. Instead I found the author gave up on scholarship somewhere around the second page of Acknowledgments and instead settled for a compendium of previously published reviews. Yes, there are several rarely published short stories (although not ""previously unpublished"" ones, since I had already read them) and a few republished pieces by other authors. Certainly if a newish reader wants an extended bibliography of Miss Heyer's works and doesn't mind the having plot endings routinely given away without warning this book might help set the chronology straight. I can't help feeling cheated by paying for something I could have well researched on my own. The one bright spot is that my disgust sent me back to the bookshelves to read ""These Old Shades."""
2,Poor quality,"My daughter loves Backyardigans. When I found this pillow case I had to get it for her. Unfortunately the quality is very poor, but she doesn't seem to mind. And as always, Austin (my daughter's favorite) isn't on it."
5,great gift,My wife has always wanted a wheelchair Barbie since she was a little girl and wound up in a wheelchair. I was really pleased by her reaction Christmas morning.
1,Not so good,"The dog treat arrived almost powdered, rather than in nuggets, so I have given it to my dogs over their feed rather than as the training treat I intended."
5,Great-for-Training Treats,"Either chicken or beef freeze-dried liver is a great training reward for dogs, and because it has such a strong flavor, it's also great to mix with crushed pills if a dog refuses to take medication in other ways (like my dog who hates peanut butter and cheese). My dog goes crazy for these treats, so I buy large quantities. But I suggest starting out with small size bags until you know your dog will like these treats as much as my dog does. The only down-sides of using freeze-dried meat is that dogs can only eat small amounts at any one time, and the handler MUST wash his/her hands afterwards. I have found that Pooch Passions treats are very expensive, compared to other freeze-dried meat treats, but I feel that this brand is well-worth the expense."
3,Number two was better,Twisted metal one was good. Two was awesome but now three isn't very good. Sure there are new people and new levels but it's not any better. If you like the series then get this. If you're not a fan rent it!!
1,just plain terrible,"TM3 is one of the worst games I have ever played. TM2 is probably the best playstation game around, which was my basis for buying TM3. The characters and the descriptions of the cars are sooo cheesy. Some of the race tracks are pretty cool but they are small. The cars in this version are also incredibly difficult to control. The Rob Zombie- and-friends soundtrack is ok but after playing the game for a while the repetitive songs get annoying. 989 studios ruined this game. I do on the other hand recommend Twisted Metal 1 and 2. They are great.(since they are done by Singletrac)"
3,989? Doesn't compare to Vigilante 8,Single trac is gone 989 now run the TM .It's fun but mediocre . Cars flip over . YOu drive find weapons shoot and that's it. What about depth? IN v8 you are limited to weapons and can shoot special attacks by pressing combinations .Pros:FunSpectre and thumper in this gameTMCons: Car flipsTM:SB abd TM2 are betterScore: 7
2,Fell way below #2 but a little above #1,"TM3 i must say was quite dissapointing. The main reason for this is beacuse the characters...There were three good characters in the whole game, the rest were poo piles. Also, the levels were too small, and there wasn't a lot to blow up. In TM 2, one of my fav things was taking down the eiffel tower w/ a remote. That was sweet, especially if an enemy was residing in the tower at the time. You just can not do that in TM 3. The graphics also, were worse than 2. I just do not understand how you can make a 2nd sequel to a great series and have worse graphics than before. But of course, 989 studios, the ones responsible for the absolutley horrific graphics of the psx nba shoot out series, were behind this game. The only good thing i can say about this game is that it is a tad better than the first and that it can become a little addicting, as each game of the series can. All in all, the best for psx in TM2, dont waste your money on #3."
1,wait a sec they call THIS piece of s---t a game???,what the [cleverly disguised swear word] r u guys thinking these graphics are worse than the [cleverly disguised swear word] atari made when it first came out. have lost ur senses (hopefully only temporaily) you guys can go s--ty n--e yourselves!gameplay= 0sound= 10 (the only good part)graphics= -10 (like i said b4 the [forceful inhalation]!)overall= -10
4,Good Game!,"Overall, this is a very good game, save some of the minor details that don't bring the game down that much."
1,A worthy warning...... Don't buy this game!,"Trust me, Do not buy this game. I am the local TM lover and know-all. I bought TM4, TM2, and TM3 (sadly I can't find a copy of TM1) After i bought TM2, I was looking forward to cool characters, cool battlegrounds, and semi-pixated graphics. I found none of these things. There are only 4 new characters, Club Kid, Auger, Flamethrower, and my favorite new driver, Flower Power. The levels, especially Washington DC, is a small open level, which is no fun. The North Pole is annoying, and I hate the boring London level. The graphics are cheesy, and 989 studios tried to make them look too real. The cars flip over with every tight turn you make, when another car hits you, or you drive onto a hill. This game is not realistic. This game should have 0 stars and is a disgrace to the TM title. I warn you, do not even look at this game. It is the worst. The car combat genre is in shame."
2,Twisted Metal 3,"Twisted Metal 3 isn't very good compaired to the other sequels (1,2,4,And Small Brawl)for it does not have good graphics and is to slow. Though it does have new charecters even though most don't show up in 4 (HammerHead,Roadkill,Spectre,ect.)This is an all around not good game.)"
3,Okay graphics but horrible handling...,"This is the beginning of the END as many people have said. I have yet to play Twisted Metal: Black on PS2, but the firing of the guns sound like those pop-things that you used as a kid (kinda weak). Twisted Metal 2 was much, much better and was more fluid...What do I want? Twisted Metal: Black to be converted to Playstation One...from what I've heard, the game has finally returned! :)"
2,Vehicle combat at it's worse!,"For all those fans of the Twisted Metal series and expecting a great sequel to Twisted Metal 2, you're not going to get it. Done by 989 Studios, not even the original team SingleTrac, TM3 is pretty much a slight improvment over TM2. Being a big fan of the first two I expected 989 to do a halfway decent job. I was wrong, it was the worst. It didn't even feel like you were playing Twisted Metal anymore other than the name. They lost the control of the originals, and the gameplay seemed more boring. Unless you're a collecter of games that is the only reason to buy this games. Other than that, stay away and play Vigilante 8 or Rogue Trip."
1,HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!,"I cant believe how much this game stunk, by far the worst in the series i mean 1,2and 4 were off the hook.It was actually fun in 1,2,and 4.The maps are WAY to small and isnt even a challange i beat it in like a 2 months with even the worst characters,so dont buy, rent!"
5,Why such poor ratings?,"I mean, sure, it wasn't all that good, but it wasn't all that bad either.It was awesome.Buy it.You might like it, you might not."
1,The beginning of the end,"This was where Twisted Metal went wrong. 989 Studios took the license from Incognito (formally Singletrac) and butchered Twisted Metal. If you want to play the good Twisted Metal games, buy 1 and 2. Don't forget to pre-order Black though, because Incognito is back in charge!"
1,The worst piece of garbage I have EVER played !,"I was a huge fan of the original two twisted metal games, so of course, I rushed out to purchase the third in the series. BIG mistake. Rent it first, if you can, then have a bottle of lysol to get the horrible stench out of your playstation when your done. Try not to vomit too much after you realize that you wasted your money to play this terrible, TERRIBLE excuse for a video game. Stick with Rogue TRip, the _true_ Twisted Metal Three. In any case, I heard TM4 was pretty good, but I don't know. 989 Studios also made that one, and I've lost my faith in them after TM3. Good Luck..."
2,stick with twisted metal 2,this game is putrid. twisted metal 2 is a superior game. the 989 studios version of the game can't hold a candle to singletrac's original playstation masterpiece.
1,If you played the series...,"...in order as I did and were old enough to discern the difference in quality between the first two and this game you may despise this game as much as I did/do. My main problem with TM3 is that it has terrible physics for a fast action game. Flipping over every two seconds during high adrenaline moments was not fun for me. It felt too loose, like every car was some giant 70's mobile or something. In my view the best Twisted Metal experience can be had with TM1, TM2, and TM: Black. I also highly recommend Rogue Trip, the game most of the same developers made after making TM2."
4,Perfect for any Freddy fan!,"If you like Freddy because of his way with words and his talent for FX-laden deaths, this tape is defintely for you. No pesky plot or realistic dialouge gets in the way of the gore! Robert Englund looks like he had fun with this one! For people who enjoyed Nightmare 2, or Freddy's Dead."
2,It's My Party,"Get past the tenth rate acting and cheap production values and you have a not too bad (not even decent either) entry to the all too cheesy, piece of crap TV series. The first half of this episode truly sucks as it spoofs ""The Exorcist"", but the second half isn't bad. The second half deals with Freddy's graduating class coming back to Springwood for their high school reunion and just finding out that the kid that wore that dirty red and green sweater all the time is not only dead, but a vicious child molester and murderer. One of his peers, a Hollywood horror film screenwriter, decides to exploit Freddy's story for the screen (it would make an excellent movie right?). For the Nightmare completist. Anyone looking for quality, look away."
4,I love mine!,"I've been using this for over a year, and I love it -- so much so that I've ordered three extra bulbs just in case. My wife thinks its neat and shows it to people. I mostly use it when my wife is driving during a long distance trip home. I read to her using this light. Sure, it could be lighter or brighter, but it is sure a handy light for reading."
3,So-so,"I thought this would be perfect for me, since my wife sleeps early and I read in bed. The size, etc. are great. Forget about using batteries with this. Worthless. The light's too dim, and the thing falls out of the book.With the adapter? Much better. The light is still not bright enough. But overall, it's a passable device if you really need to read in the dark without disturbing your spouse."
5,From the manufacturer&#65533;,"Dimming lights are often caused by drained batteries. NiteOwl offers 5-6 hrs continuous burn time with 2AA batteries, so if you're close to that amount of time, you may want to try replacing the batteries. Avid night-time readers should consider purchasing the AC or DC adaptor! If you continue to experience problems with the product, or have product questions, call Lumatec's customer service line at 800-776-7945. It's a great product and continues to be the most innovative on the market today! Enjoy!"
1,Don't try this at home!,I bought one of these when my old light died and was very disapointed. It ripped several of my books and didn't light very well. Plus getting the battery case open and closed takes is almost impossible. I recomend people do not buy these. They're not worth the trouble and batteries.
3,Great idea but not all it could be.,"This is a great concept that falls a bit short in realization. The on/off device is smooth and the light extends and retracts smoothly and well but the two of these that I have are very uneven in light intensity when using batteries. The light will vary from quite dim to bright and is best for only about 20 minutes after inserting fresh batteries. The optional plug-in converter, which I bought after unsuccessful attempts to get decent service out of 2 AA batteries, solves the problem. However, now there is a power cord attached to the power converter. The upside of this arrangement is that it is much lighter than the battery pack. In the end, I think a AA battery flashlight will work as well or better, but one does have to hold it."
1,So ineffective I threw it away.,"The lite was too heavy for use with paperbacks. You have to hold it in place or it keeps falling out. Also, you only get a few hours of reading from a set of batteries, and where I bought mine you couldn't get the AC adaptor. Additionally, the bulb dims periodically and you have to tap on it to make it brighten. It was so ineffective and frustrating, I threw mine away! A great idea that falls way short of expectations."
4,Bedroom curtains,"Nice kitchen or bedroom curtains, medium weight fabric and not see through for privacy. I had to order a double set of to accommodate a wider window and the are all the same length. Good value nice color"
5,Back to the Boardwalk,"Songs that bring you back to the beach! From famous hits to hidden treasures...this anthology takes you to the Boardwalk with the waves and the sun. A great collection of true beach music. Put on your shades, lie back and listen to the fun."
3,semi fun in the sun,"Beach music is required where I live....and this colection sure has some surf fun music. But not really enough good old songs to make this worth my while. Get it if you want certain beach music standards, but otherwise a so so cd."
3,Disco beach?,"I don't understand how this anthology relates to the beach. I'm not knocking the songs because the 50s R&B and 60s soul songs are excellent, but there is no connection to the surf or sand. It is really stretching it when the songs get into the 70s with disco bands like Tavares. This compilation is similar to the Motown and Stax/Volt box sets which, under their criteria, could have been labeled beach music as well. Get it for the music, but you'll have a hard time convincing your friends that this is beach music"
1,Mancala travel game,"I wanted a small travel version of this game. I didn't realize quite how small it was going to be! The ""stones"" are the size of aquarium gravel. I think it is going to be way too easy to lose the stones. It's pretty hard to move the ""stones"", even for the 8 yr old that I was playing with, so it wasn't fun to play. It made it too hard to play. I'm sure the wood and tiny stones are durable, but possibly quite ""loseable""."
1,WAY TOO SMALL - great game when larger,"I am an elementary school counselor. I had a larger version of this game that was also called ""travel sized"" but it was MUCH larger. We all love the game at our school, kids and staff alike.This version of this game (as previously noted by another reviewer) has such tiny ""pieces""/""stones"" that even my tiny third grade girls were unable to play with it. They said the pieces and compartments in the game were too small and it was too difficult to play. They chose another activity because of this problem. Also, the tiny ""stones"" will be very easily lost and very difficult to replace...unless you have TINY pebbles near where you live. The ""stones"" in this are smaller than most pieces of asphalt that crumble off of roadways. I'm SERIOUS.Go for a larger version!!"
3,"It Takes Small, Sure Fingers...","Mancala is a great game to play anywhere, so I was excited to find a travel mancala set to take to the beach. The board itself is well built, solid with a good hinge spring to keep it shut.My main complaint with the set was the stones, which are painted micro-pebbles of varying sizes. Although the irregular shapes contribute to the faux-authenticity of the game, they are extremely hard to handle, pick out of the small board holes, and distribute without dropping into the wrong hole. There is also a strong possibility of having your carefully held fingerful of stones fall away completely, scattering across the floor and initiating a completely new kind of game!My second problem with the set is the instructions. There are several variations on Mancala, and this one is obscure and hard to understand. No other options are presented for the players to use.Skip this one, set aside a little extra room, and take a full sized board with real stones."
3,Disapponting rendition,"Mancala is a classic strategy game that is easy for young children to learn to play. I purchased this travel version to save storage space in my house. Alas--the stones are too small for little fingers. Most of the stones are really pebbles. Although there are plenty of extra stones, they will soon be lost. The stones could and should have been larger."
4,terrific book!,"i picked out ""who dun-it"" from the beginning, but that didnt take away from the fun of it! i did enjoy this one and the more i read, the more i'm sure ive seen the movie. is it all in my mind, or has this (or something very similar) been made into a movie?? another good one from nora ::smile"
3,Wasn't the best,This wasn't the best Nora Roberts I had read but then not the worst book I've read. It was enjoyable enough but other books written by Nora have been more indepth and interesting. Little Mills and Boons for my liking however would buy her books again.
3,Sacred Sins,"I absolutely love Nora Roberts but this book... not so much !! It's written more like her ""alter ego"" JD Robb... :-("
2,Slow and mild,I didn't enjoy reading this one as I did with other Nora Roberts works. I certainly took my time to read it and congratulated myself for tolerating it till the end.
2,Not my favorite Nora Roberts by FAR.,"Think it's depressing, but will continue to read it off and on to see if the killer is who I think it is. In the meantime, I'm leaving it at 52% on my Kindle. Have skipped over much of the filler fluff."
2,NYPD TV Episode,"This is like watching one of the cop TV episodes. It was cute, and I didnt figure out the killer to the end, but still I cant reccommend this for someone to purchase. You can read it on a long flight."
4,Page Turner,"Nora Roberts is the type of auther to keep you in suspense and unlike other romance writers, she always gives the reader little twists and turns that you don't expect. This book is a page turner!"
2,Is there nothing new under the sun?,"I'm really getting weary of formula fiction. You know, the theory that opposites attract and live happily ever after -- well, after they've stopped the crime spree and saved their city from a psychopathic killer.I'm not against romantic stories about rough-around-the-edges cops and the women who love them...I just wish authors could add a new wrinkle or two.This book is perfect for the beach or when you've been in bed for a few days with a cold and don't want to tax your brain. But, good fiction, it's not."
5,sacred sins,"was sorry to find i already had that book,really wish they`donly release ones that were new or say was previously released"
4,A real Page turner!,This was my introduction to Nora Roberts and I will continue to read her wonderful books. Anybody that has been wanting to read a wonderful book just pick up a roberts book.
2,Sacred Sins,"So Nora goes Hollywood. If this was my first Nora Roberts novel it may have been my last. If this a new venue count me out. What a major disappointment. Spare me a political message. Do what you do best, romance. What if Ms. Roberts had a loved one who was victim to ""the preist"" would she feel so compassionate? How outrageous!"
2,Sacred Sins,"Not Nora Roberts best work, most of her books I can not put down, I had no problem walking away from this book"
4,Good Thriller/Suspense Novel!,"Girls are being strangled and left with a priest's amice around their necks. Detective Ben Paris has the job of finding the murderer. Dr. Tess Court has been asked to consult, giving a psychiatric profile for the police. But, when Tess receives a call from the killer, things in the case and her new relationship with Ben start to get sticky. Will Ben be able to protect Tess? Will Ben and Tess find the murderer before he gets too close?Nora Roberts' psychological thriller/romantic suspense novel is well-plotted and the characters are well-devised. It leaves you on the edge of your seat until the last page. This is not a light-hearted mystery, but a story so intense, one moment I felt the pull of love between the main characters. In the next instant, a tear rolled down my cheek during an unbelievably sad moment."
3,more of the same,Nora Roberts continues to write interesting mystery/romance novels. This one is no different. Mixing the brusque cop and the thoughtful shrink. Easy reading.
1,Slow Read,Love Nora Roberts. She is one of my favorite authors but this book does not do her justice. It was a slow read. Took everything I had to finish it. Very disappointing.
4,Easy read,Found it an easy relaxing read and I was unable to pick the culprit but I was able to pick the ending.
3,Good book,"I expected much more from this book. It was good, but nothing outstanding. Nora Roberts has better books than this one."
5,Nora Review,"As a Kindle version it was delivered promptly, another great book from this author that is recommended for reading especialyy for ladies"
5,Great Video about the life of Nikola Tesla,If you want to know about Nikola Tesla this is the video to see!! very in depth and informative video from PBS!!
3,"Mostly larger images, but still a good resource","As a graphic designer with a soft spot for period illustration, I love to collect the Dover books that feature Victorian and old-time copyright free images. I used a number of the images in this book, but since some were part of a larger scene and/or somewhat muddy in quality, they all needed a bit of digital touchup. I realize that the images are vintage, but it's hard to use them when the lines run together and some small details are little more than blobs. The large size of most images reflects their original use as multiple-vignette posters, but again this makes it difficult to isolate a single image from the larger overall scene. To conclude on a high note, it is a valuable collection of antique circus images and I do enjoy having it in my library. My client is also pleased with the amusing images I was able to glean for his website...."
3,Last Song On trailer,"I dont know if this drove anyone else crazy, but, the song at the end of the trailer for the movie is ""Here is Gone"" by the Goo Goo Dolls"
4,"Good Sountrack, but does not flow well with movie","This is a soundtrack is good, and worth the $. However, the tracks are not crafted well into the movie itself. The only songs that actually worked with the scenes were the love ode ""Promise Ring"" by Tremolo and Beth Orton's cover of ""Wild World"". The upbeat songs in the sountrack are nice, but do not overlap in the movie well at all."
3,Shiloh Season,"I think that th is is a interesting book because two people that aren't to fond of each other become friends because of a dog named Shiloh. My favorite part about this book is when Judd, Shiloh's old owner that used to treat him like dirt, crashes and Shiloh saves him by going and getting his new family. All in all it is a pretty good book."
4,"This is a pretty good book, and I recommend it to all ages.","This is a book report on Shiloh Season by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor. I am doing it for my reading class. This is the second of three books about Shiloh a dog. It is about a kid who worked for a man named Jud to get Shiloh from him. When the kid gets Shiloh, he treats him well, unlike Jud who treated him bad. When Jud gives Shiloh to the kid he gets lonely and starts drinking a lot. He gets drunk and tries to run over Shiloh but instead runs off the road and crashes. People try to be nice to Jud because he crashed and got hurt bad. Finally, one night the boy visits Jud with Shiloh. When they get there for the first time Shiloh licked Jud's hand. I recommend this book to people of all ages."
4,Top Caliber Sequel..............,"Once again Phyllis Reynolds Naylor has delivered a fantastic family story. Her writing style makes you feel as if you are part of the story. The story is full of family values. As a native West Virginian I love to hear mention of the West Virginia towns of Clarksburg, Wheeling, Sistersville, Middlebourne, St. Mary's, and of course Friendly.This sequel to Shiloh finds Marty adjusting to his life with the beloved beagle he saved from an abusive owner. Marty is concerned that the owner may still try to take Shiloh away or worse try to shoot him. Marty struggles with his conscience in dealing with Judd Traverse. At times he can't stand him and; yet, he also can't help but feel that Judd is the way he is because he does not know any other way to act, that know one has ever showed him love and respect. Marty is determined to show Judd that all people are not bad.The story did to seem to end abruptly.We are excited about reading the next book in the trilogy."
4,Shiloh Season,"I think that th is is a interesting book because two people that aren't to fond of each other become friends because of a dog named Shiloh. My favorite part about this book is when Judd, Shiloh's old owner that used to treat him like dirt, crashes and Shiloh saves him by going and getting his new family. This is a great sequel to the first Shiloh book. All in all it is a pretty good book."
2,review for Shiloh Season,"Shiloh Season is about a boy who has problems with his neihbor, Judd Travers. Judd is probably a 40 year old man. He drinks and drives and hunts in the wrong seasons. One day Marty cought him hunting in the wrong season and made a deal with Judd that if he did'nt tell anyone he could have Shilo. I would not reccomend this book to young children because they might not be able to understand it very well. It was'nt one of my favorite books and did'nt really cacth my attention. Don't waste your time and money if it does not sound interesting to you."
4,Runner's friend,"I use these at the gym and also for jogging outdoors. They keep you foot sung but not tight. They also let in enough air to cool your feet, preventing smelly sneakers. The sole is a tad tall, but in a couple of months I'm sure I'll be glad they ""were""."
3,It is only Okay,Not very exciting because there are no colored pictures so it doesn't do justice to some really fancy guns. Sot of dry historical reading.
2,"Sometimes fun, most often not","This game seemed like it would be an interesting and fun way for my friends to spend an evening in a different way. Most of us like thinking and problem solving games but the questions in Mindtrap are more often than not the kind that are based on some sort of logical twist or trick and not very analytic-- some cannot be solved without making some sort of absurd assumption, a feature which I would think the question writers could have avoided. This game can be fun for awhile but it ceases to be enjoyable a long time before anyone can come close to winning. It is much better to just ask questions and see who can come up with answers in a more informal way, the unevenness of questions makes fair competition impossible."
3,was it a dark and stormy night?,grabbing questions pretty liberally from the small paperbacks of 'lateral thinking puzzles' this box of goodies puts a question and answer on each card and provides a roll of the die (marked with 1-3 dots) to move along a simple path to achieve victory.I've played it a number of times now and feel it's not difficult enough to be a challenge. I think there's only been one puzzle that has had me beat and that goes for my partner as well.If you enjoy these kinds of puzzles then this is OK - I bought it on special as I don't think it had sold too well. At full price I'd have keenly felt the price whenever I played.
3,It's Okay,"If you like thinking a lot and are good at making up far-fetched stories, this is a fun game, but it's kind of boring unless you get into it."
4,"A very good,durable toy.Really gets your brain working!",Mindtrap is a game that consists of really challenging puzzles.I would recommend it for over 12's.It is good fun trying to get the answers & finding out what it is after you puzzling over it for a long time.Highly recommended.
2,Should not fall under trivia category,"Although the game is interesting, it involves more logic and problem solving then anything else. I was expecting a, ""Trivia"" game with a new twist, but instead I got things like, ""If Jack saws a piece of wood into two equal pieces, how many pieces would Jack have to saw to make 8 equal pieces."
5,An educational fun trivia masterpeice without limits.,"We have often just left a few Mind Trap cards sitting idly on a table. Without thought, anyone nearby will pick one or more up. It becomes a conversation peice. It doesn't have to become score keeping contest, but rather an interesting conversation ice breaker as one person after another takes their turn quizing others. Parent & children alike are facinated, strangers break the ice & the question without fail is, where did you find this game. Ours came from Creative Teaching, a teachers & puiblic teachers supply in Solana Beach, Ca. five years ago. It alway's pleased us when anyone would walk off with some cards. It was just OK. END"
2,"Maybe it's just us, but...","Maybe it's just us, but we didn't find this game very challenging. The puzzles are of the ""you are in a house with an all southern exposure; a bear walks past a window, what colour is it?"" type. You move along a track. You answer questions from a card. If you succeed, you can roll a die for the number of spaces to move and then give the next player a try, or you can move one space and get another question. We played two teams of two. We never rolled the dice, and combined we only got one question wrong.Oh, and to answer the puzzle, a house with an all southern exposure would have to be on the north pole, so the bear would be white."
2,"Interesting, but Boring","Mind trap is very fun at first, but after about ten times playing it, it's just annoying. You get a bunch of cards with puzzles to solve on them. To be honest, I memorized the answers to all of the cards in about 1 week. Not very interesting. It got a 5 for durability, because it will last forever (because it will only be played about 20 times)"
1,Don't like riddles,"This game is very different from some of the other suggested items in this category which claim to be similar. This game is mostly riddles, which were difficult. Several friends I tried to play this with didn't like it either. The questions are like this ""Bob went for a walk without bringing his raincoat or hat or umbrella. How did his hair not get wet?"" The answer is - it wasn't raining.And that is one of the easier ones. Most are so far out nobody could guess the answer. If you like riddles, you would like this game."
2,overpriced and silly,"The premise behind this game (questions that don't involve trivia) is interesting, but the game really falls flat. The questions are all either ridiculously easy or impossible, with nothing in between. It can be very frustrating when one player gets three easy questions in a row, while someone else gets all the impossible ones. The other problem, and this is a big one, is that lots of these questions have more than one logical answer, so how to you give credit to something that sounds reasonable, but isn't on the card? This game claims to be requiring ""outside-the-box"" thinking skills, but then puts you right back in the box with the limited answer choices.Also, why should a game that consists of a bunch of paper cards cost $ ?"
2,A complete waste of time,"This has to be one of the most idiotic games out there. Often the answer is impossible to get using the information you are given, other times the answer is so weird you'd never guess it. My husband and I are intelligent people and yet we just end up frustrated and annoyed, and usually give up before the game has ended."
2,Frustrating and irritating,"Instead of clever and entertaining mind-benders, the questions and their solutions in this game are largely contrived and obscure. A few questions are so easy that you wonder whether they've crept into the wrong game, while most of the rest are so contrived as to be unanswerable. Not a good family game as it leads to frustration and boredom while waiting for participants to try to guess the solutions. Also the game allows no room for the possibility that alternative acceptable solutions exist if not the same as the one given. I do not recommend this game for family fun."
5,Kikyo returns and Sango finally arrives!,"The first two episodes feature the main story of this DVD. Kikyo's back(again), and it leads into a major confrontation between her, Inu-Yasha and Kagome. There's some real drama going on, and this scene really starts Inu-Yasha's problem of choosing either Kikyo or Kagome.The third episode introduces another major character into the series, the demon slayer Sango. We see how her life ends as she knows it, when evil <expletive deleted> Naraku does something really heartless. What it is, I'm not saying. It's pretty much the typical good Inu-Yasha stuff fans have come to expect. Now that volume 9's out, I'm going to try to buy it as soon as possible."
1,I Feel Violated.,"I have all the Inu-Yasha DVD's up to this one, and they are all excellent. I preordered this one and have the next 2 on preorder as well. Inu-Yasha is one of the most entertaining series I have seen in a while. Here comes the but. BUT the quality off this DVD was terrible. At full screen on my pc all kinds of terrible lines show up in the picture. It looks much worse than any VHS picture. I tried it in my player attached to my TV and it has the copy protection fade that none of the others have had. I have an old TV so I have to run the DVD player through the VCR. Furthermore the first thing that happens when you put in the disc is it plays a minute long commercial for Ranma1/2 This is also a first for the series. I think I'm paying enough for these without having to put up with commercials. I am going to contact the publisher, VIZ entertainment, and complain about the plummeting quality. If I don't get satisfaction from the company I will probably cancel my order."
2,Product Good - Seller Unresponsive,"I bought this product for my grandma. She asked me to get her a large cuff, so I ordered the large, but a medium was delivered. I emailed they replied,"" This item comes packaged in a box and the large cuff is included within. These were never repackaged. Please give us the bar code on the box.""I emailed ABC will the barcode and no response. I waited four days and resent the message and no response. This happend in September. I ended up just ordering a new cuff. I was really disappointed and will not order from them again.The product itself seems decent. My granmda has not had any issues, though she does not love the style of cuff. But it seems to give accurate readings and is easy to use."
1,No work,"Pressure is not accurate too low or too high. Cuff is too wide for shortish arms,so too tight near upper arm to also fit around elbow area."
5,Excellent product,This blood pressure monitor is very accurate. I compared it with the doctor's reading at his office when my pressure was taken. I have purchased several monitors and this comes the closest to an accurate reading. I would highly recommend it.
4,Works great,Works better than the Omron product that it replaced. It is easier to wrap the cuff around the arm and quicker to give you a reading than the Omron product. I would have given it 5 stars if it had the memory feature.
1,Seller was less helpful,Seller was less helpful in trying to get me the product as a gift that I've ordered for my aunt for out of town. Poor customer service in which UPS held it and eventually i was force to return the product and lost my shipping fund from the order. Don't think I'll buy from here again.
1,Second Unit ... Second Failure,"What good is BP machine if it is not accurate? There are a few devices in this world that need to be accurate and a BP monitor is one. This is my second fault LifeSource. The first one was replaced by the retailer and this one lasted all of a few months before the readings went bonkers... they would go 170, then to 148, finally to 162 in one setting taking three identical posture readings... New batteries? YES ... Abuse of the machine? NO ... LifeSource is poor quality? YES... Recommended? NO! Finally, dealing with LifeSource and their warranty process is time consuming and to get a replacement unit expensive... They charge $10 to ship you another unit plus you have to return your old unit to them ... $8-10. So figure time and $20... FYI"
4,good home unit,"Important to note, while many ""medium"" cuffs are small on adult men, this one fits most. You only need the large if you are obess or lift weights regularly for bulk."
5,Taking care of your health,"Purchased this unit to replace an identical one that I""ve had for years. The price has halved in the ensuing years, and the quality is still tops. It is a fantastic easy-to-use unit."
4,Blood Pressure Monitor,"Read a lot of reviews, and chose this model because of the positive comments. Works well and has been certified accurate compared to our doctor's instruments."
5,This album is absolutely gorgeous,"These guys are seriously my favorite band right now. This is an absolutely gorgeous compilation of music. It is deep, sorrowful, reflective, lonely, quiet, hopeful, and breathtaking. Seriously, folks. I think I even cried when I first heard this and I'm not much of a softy. I went all the way to Chicago to see these guys - they are the best undiscovered band I know. Well worth the investment. I give it 6 stars on a scale of 5."
5,The Six Parts Seven take my breath away......,"This is a great album from start to finish. An instrumental album which can be described as neither post-rock nor math-rock. It is filled with guitar driven epics that are flavored with a hint of cello and piano. The songs come off unflawed and sincere, unlike some of the works of the more pretentious, so called ""hip"" artists, who wish they could come up with something this brilliant. No lyrics are needed!!!"
3,Pretty trumps predictable,"3 1/2Quite decent instrumental rock can sometimes be like an Explosions without the Sky, especially when dawdling away on guitar melodies that go nowhere. Usually though, all is rung in, and layered out nice enough to earn a place in your second-tier post-rock CD section."
2,Mundanely vanilla,"How can you call sweeping crescendoes pretentious? I might be wrong but Beethoven employed sweeping crescendoes to his emperor concerto and I really dont think Beethoven was very pretentious considering he died broke and unrevered. Back to the point at hand, this album is dull and uneventful. It aims to be pastoral but never evokes anything from its sound beyond tepid instrumentation and monotonous, atonal undercurrents. Its slow to develop and is a far reach from average. Remember, talent does not always equate with creativity and innovation. Try Eluvium or By the End of Tonight instead, you will be much more pleased with the results."
3,"Sweet Sixteen, Approaching Middle Age","There is not nearly enough of the music of Tomas Luis de Victoria on CDs, nor of Francisco Guerrero nor Juan Vasquez, nor any of the great Cathedral composers of the Golden Age of Spain, the 16th Century. Thus, on one hand I'm thrilled to see Harry Christophers and The Sixteen undertake this huge recording project, apparently all the motets of Victoria. Unfortunately, however, they're doing it poorly. They used to have some energy in their voices. Their recordings of Handel and Monteverdi were never my ultimate choices but they were worthy contenders. Now they sound more tired than The Tallis Scholars. They seem to equate sanctity with lethargy of tempo. The sum of four or more voices on a part is often less focused, less rich in timbre, than a single voice, and in this performance of the Lamentations of Jeremiah, by Victoria, each voice sounds like a committee."
1,overpriced-returned them,I thought they were sending 25 sets of A-Z dividers. Only one set...way overpriced. Returned it.
3,Not a Deluxe Version of Yahtzee!!,"I have always enjoyed playing Yahtzee and wanted to get a nice version of the game. I decided on the Deluxe version because I liked the idea of having a tray to use to roll the dice in and from the picture it looked like it would be a good quality product. Boy was I wrong! The game is of course the classic game, so I won't knock the game itself. But the tray that this comes with is very flimsy. I had expected it to be a solid plastic tray but it is not. The rest of the game is fine, but because I had paid twice as much for this deluxe version, I thought I would be getting a better quality product than I did."
5,Yahtzee makes you YAHOO!,Yahtzee is a wonderful game! (Actually it has been a wonderful game for a long time!) It's a great party game to have around and/or a perfect game for the family after dinner! It's devastating when you don't role good but it's SUPER when you do role good. Yahtzee gets 5 stars from me and two thumbs up! If you don't have Yahtzee then get it now because it should be in every household. It's a tradition! Thanks for your time! (_8^(I)
5,HICKSON IS MISS MARPLE,"SAME AS ALL HICKSON'S MISS MARPLE. AS IN MY OTHER REVIEWS, SHE IS THE BEST MARPLE EVER. ALL MOVIES IN THIS SERIES GIVE YOU A GOOD MYSTERY."
3,it's ok,I know the reviews say that this is the best Miss Marple movie but I liked the one with Elizabeth Taylor & Rock Hudson better.
4,+Bueno,"Otra muestra de la versatilidad del maestro Gustavo Cerati. Un buen album, para demostrar otras alternativas a la banda latinoamericana"
3,Book Summary (not review),"from the back of the book:Instinct warned her to avoid a man like Nick!But as he was the new owner of the vineyard where Shannon rented a small cottae, their meeting was inevitable.Life hadn't been easy for Shannon. Supporting her young orphaned niece had left her little time for male friends and someone like Nick was totally beyond her experience. She quickly discovered he had the power to disturb her emotions and she realized the danger of allowing him into her life.Nick Stanich, however, didn't wait to be invited. He took over, commanding and demanding. And in spite of her best intentions, Shannon soon found herself responding!"
4,Surprisingly Fun,"When I first saw War Games in the store, I thought it would be a lame Command and Conquer rip-off. I was wrong. After borrowing it from a friend, I changed my mind, and now I own it. In War Games, you control a group of vehicles in each stage, and you can play as NORAD (human) or WOPR (robots). However, it's not like Command and Conquer or other strategy games where you select a unit, then choose an action. You actually have full control, sort of like an overhead-view, strategy based Twisted Metal with a whole lot of different vehicles. Check this one out."
5,Really pulls you in!,"This fourth of the Rev. Merrily Watkins mystery series is a fine example of a book you just want to hunker down with. I particularly like the fact that Merrily is not perfect, even as a member of the clergy. But you have to read to find out why!"
5,Well Written Book!,This Book is Well Written by several highly esteemed Scientists. Worth a read most definitely!!
4,"Interesting, but....","It's a little hard to see how Mary Daly can even be mentioned with a great genius like Virginia Woolf, especially when one considers that Woolf was able to make a new rhetoric apart from patriarchal language, while ""theorists"" like Daly have only succeeded in questioning contemporary discourse. Nevertheless, a worthwhile book that, when dealing with a major figure like Virginia Woolf, deserves to be read."
5,magnificent,"This book dares to include three of the very greatest writers of the century. Mary Daly is the incredibly courageous voice of contemporary radical feminism, Woolf is still valuable for her essays, and Adrienne Rich is a truly visionary poet who has changed the way contemporary discourse is conducted. A wonderful book."
3,No problems with product,I had ordered the soap hoping it would fit a wooden container with a lid that I own. It did not. There is no problem with soap or its use.
3,Shaving Soap,"The soap smells good, and fits the soap holder, but I have not used it yet since I had an open bar a shaving soap I wanted to use first."
2,Unsung heros,"This is one of those books that I could not put down until finished. It is a tale well told--unfortunately for the wrong reasons. There is no question that these people should be honored but not at the price of compromising today's ongoing intelligence efforts.The author seems to feel that ""the peoples (relatives) right to know"" trumps any need to protect ""sources and methods"" and national security. He attributes all attempts at secrecy to a desire to hide blunders. And he feels that certainly anything that happened over 30 years ago has no need to be withheld. For an opposing view I would direct readers to most any non-fiction book on ""intelligence tradecraft."" You can search that term on the Internet and get a good book list. ###"
3,All over the place,"I bought this book because I love everything covert. This book tried to explain the deaths of a handful of CIA employees. Some of the stories offer some insight on their lives, others only sugar-coat their lives. You can tell that in order to have the victims families participate in the book, Ted Gup had to make all of these guys and girls look flawless. I agree all of these people are heros because they died for their country, but not all of them were saints. I found this book hard to follow because the author jumps around quite a bit. Overall, an interesting read, I am glad I read it."
2,Finest example of journalistic mediocrity!,"The only reason why I managed to finish this book is just so that I can write this and say: ""After reading this book...""The style is characteristic of ""Washington Post"" and ""Time Mag"" - each true hero is patronizingly framed in a human interest story format of Yello' Jo School of Journalism.Each story seeps with condescension and thinly veiled anti-CIA political slant. Gup would have done better by declaring his bias. Instead, his personal contempt wafts through his writing like a foul odor through caramel coating.So... after reading this book I am firmly convinced that in a line-up of truly bad journalists, Gup would be solidly in the middle."
5,What an eye-opener.,"Though this book leaves you yearning for more - information about the lives, family and operations - the stories absorb you right in. The hard truth of these covert operations coupled with the interviews of family/friends bears a broad spectrum of opinions.It's a really good book, particularly if you know very little about the CIA."
4,A True Book of Honor,"Having just completed F.M. Bailey's classic Mission to Tashkent (out-of-print), this book was a wonderful continuation of the lives and trials that are the pricetag of intelligence gathering. Mr. Gup's book is well written and seemingly very well researched.Forget James Bond, Derek Flynt and Jack Ryan. Reality, as usual, is far more compelling than anything Hollywood can offer."
2,Familes of CIA Agents,"""The Book of Honor"" is an extremely well written account of the lives and families of CIA agents who died for their country. Unfortunately, the author spends more time describing the homes where these heroes grew up rather than the circumstances under which they perished. Not only does it not place enough emphasis on covert operation (or the reasons for them), the book is written from an antagonistic perspective. Throughout the book, the author continually takes jabs at the CIA and U.S. covert operations community. There are some interesting historical facts lightly sprinkled through out its pages, but not nearly enough to make it worthwhile. If you want a little action and insight into the lives of individuals as CIA operatives, please look for another book to read. If you are looking for mundane letters between boyfriend and girlfriend or mother and son, this book is for you."
2,Depressing,"This is a depressing book.It's entirely about all of our people who were caught and killed....No happy ending, no success stories..EVERYBODY gets killed...a real downer."
1,Asleep at the Switch - Gup,Many brave men and women have paid the ultimate price for their country. The stars on the wall at CIA Headquarters represents some of them. It is sad that Mr. Gup does not have a clue.
5,Fascinating!,"We have all seen or read James Bond, Jason Bourne and Austin Powers. But what do spies do, really? What are the very real dangers they face day in and day out. Inside CIA Headquarters is the Wall of Honor, with 102 stars carved into the marble signifying a CIA employee who died in the line of duty. Because their exploits are classified, they and their deeds are nameless to the public, until now. This book covers the circumstances behind several of these brave individuals' sacrifices that have been declassified by the CIA. This stuff is not just riveting, it is real life. It is a fitting tribute to those who protect us every day from enemy attack, working anonymously, and are never thanked for their service."
2,slow and with a slant,I haven't read the book but the 6 hour audiobook was fairly slow for what could have been much more interesting considering the subject matter. It seemed like the author really has an axe to grind against the CIA. The stories seemed overly focused on any mistakes the CIA made. The author lost credibility with me when he said he was the one who revealed the presence of the secret nuclear bunker that was to be used by the US Congress in the instance of a nuclear strike.
4,An X Windowing Primer,"An Excelent way to start Your X Programming. With this book You will learn the basics of C-oriented X Windows, that is initializing and showing windows, catching and handling events, and overview the usage of some interesting X-utilities as well as the usage and creation of some advanced utilities (such as widgets and toolkits)..."
5,Missing letters,I have the Scrabble Deluxe Travel Game and I am missing one letter A and one letter R. I would like to know the e-mail address for Milton Bradley Company so that I could have the letters replaced. Thank You.
1,I hate this game.,It's just like filling out a crossword puzzle. It's boring. Also you have use words that are in the dictionary. What's up with that?
4,"High Price, Low Durability","I love to be able to travel with Scrabble, especially when the game is small enough to pack in an overnight bag. As soon as I opened the game to pack it for my long trip, however, I was disappointed to find the latch that closes the board didn't work; I had to use a rubberband to secure it. In addition, the paper backing warped easily. Having purchased the game in another state, I couldn't return or exchange it. The game's durability is very below par for its price, and doesn't qualify as ""deluxe."" Bottom line: Travel Scrabble Deluxe is a great concept in a convenient size, but poorly executed and overpriced."
4,Terrific Management Training Tool,"As an Org Behavior professor, I found this book to provide great examples relating to the high costs of employee chun (in terms of ""dead time"" spent in rehiring events while the manager's competitors with low-employee turnover can focus on revenue generating productivity). Other costs involved with high employee turnover include the manager's reputation as a leader, lost customers and damaged morale of ""survivors"". In the super competitive, downsized work environment today, retention accountability can no longer be ignored.The author provides research examples that supports the need for managers to make employees feel apart of the organization, go home at night feeling appreciated, excited and he provides ""best practice"" strategies being used by managers and organizations with low employee turnover.A great management training tool that provides interesting examples and stats to capture the attention of managers!"
4,Tomorrow is Today,"If you are at all concerned about the rapidly changing tide of business and its' affect on the workplace this book should help. Less than a year ago it was difficult to acquire and maintain top notch talent. This book gives straight forward advice on how to do just that. However, it goes much further in developing ideas for enhancing the workplace and making it a favorite destination. Good talent will always be hard to find. Greg Smith's obvious concern for employees and his desire for their success is supported by excellent case studies and examples.Here Today,Here Tomorrow is a solid resource which, once read, can be referred to repeatedly for sound excellent advice on how to run a company both ethically and successfully."
4,Good but not great,"Topping is always original, witty and high on irony. Reading his books can be more entertaining that the programme he is commenting on. For this reason, this is an excellent buy and well worth every penny (or cent) you spend. Topping writes a detailed account of every episode, yet more importantly he discusses issues that are raised, and is not frightened of being controversial or critical. While this is highly recommended, if you want to see Topping at his best, read his guide on buffy. It will blow you away."
5,"Love it Is the best, Is so wonderful","My daugther and I love this product; we are really white so went we use this product we get a beautiful color, I realy recommended the price is not bad and the smell is my favorite thing of this product, and love how the shimmer looks on your skin it looks like went you are in the beach and receive that beautiful glow with the sun, love it I realy love it.... Hope you cant tried and see what I am taking about. God Bless bye"
5,Don't Pre judge,"I have bought the CD since my last review and now form a different opinion to the one I had when I had only listened to the sound clips. CDs' 1 and 3 are early recordings of Claudio Villa at his best. CD 2 is a later work with more predominent backing, maybe a bit over orchestrated for the lovers of his early works. CD 1 and 3 suffer in sound quality in comparison to CD 2 BUT the songs are wonderful. The Collection is worth the price just for CDs 1 and 3."
3,Great Vocals But !!!!!,"Pity, to me it sounds like the original vocals, but a ""new"" inferior (jazzy) backing track has been laid over the vocals. If only they had left them alone, because they were perfect as they were."
2,Invicta watch,"I had to return this item. The automatic function on it was broken. They did not have another in stock or I would've re-ordered it at the time.It looked sharp, more of a dress watch than a typicle everyday watch.I would've kept it but to wind it manually every other day didn't sit too well with me.The back was see-thru (nice-feature) but unfortunately that is how I knew it was broken. I have another watch similar to this make and it looks and feels good on the wrist.I would've given it 4 stars if it worked."
3,celtic religion,"information was dry and really hard to keep on task when reading. Not my cup of tea, some useful info though when i could make myself read it."
5,I CANNOT DESCRIBE IN WORDS HOW MUCH I LOVED THESE BOOKS!,"The ""Shiloh"" trilogy itself is the best, I mean BEST books I have ever read in my LIFE! I'm not kidding! They were terrific! I felt like I was IN the story. The writer, Phyllis Reynolds Naylor, should get the ""Best Author of the Millenium"" award (there isn't really a ""Best Author of the Millenium"" award, but if there was one, Phyllis Reynolds Naylor should get it!). Do you hate books? If so, these ones will certainly change your mind! I don't know how I will find a book as good as these...*sigh*.This series is in the order of: ""Shiloh"" ""Shiloh Season"" and ""Saving Shiloh""NOTE: If you don't read these books in order they were written, they won't make much sense..."
3,If you want to read this go ahead,"The book I read is Saving Shiloh. This book is the third Shiloh book of its trilogy. This book would have been better if I would have read all the books first. It was a good book because it had a little bit of everything. I would recomend this book to anybody as long as they read the first two books. This book is sad because Shiloh, the dog and also Charies best friend dies of old age. The summary of this book is that a boy and his friend heres about the police finding a dead body. They think Judd Travers ( A always drunk hothead) did it. Charlie ( the main charicter) has to worry about his dogs safety and protect him. The main reason he would not let him go. Is Judd was in a wreck and is a very abuseive owner. He also used to own Shiloh untill Charlie worked real herd to get Shiloh. And Judd wasent about to let a 12 year old boy get his favorite hunting dog.Did Judd killk that man youll have to read it and find out."
1,A complete waste of time.,"Summary of Saving Shilough: An idiot boy who has no grammer sense ranting on about how his poor, suffering dog was abused by his previous accursed owner. Then he finds out that his old accursed owner isn't so accursed any more. This is an extremely boring and pointless book. Honestly, any book where the main plot is about a boy who simply can't stop feeling sorry for his dog and wishing his sister would ""Fall into a hole and take the dirt with her (traslation: go to hell)"" is a pretty worthless, time-wasting book."
3,Saving Shiloh,"I give the book ""Saving Shiloh"" 3 stars, but at least it is better than the first book. The book is about a kid name Marty, and he has bad grammars. He loves his dog very much, which he got from some old mean looking guy, and it looks like he loves his dog more than his oldest sister. Also the book is like a mystery since Marty and his friend tries to solve the mystery of a murder.The book is sort of boring once in awhile, since all they do is talk, talk, and talk some more about Shiloh. When there is action like when something big is happening, that is when the book gets interesting. I like the book because it shows the action with great detail, and I could already picture the scene in my head."
5,The Jacket,Great book on how children can become influenced by how their parents treat others. It was nice to see how the young boy over came his diversity on his own. Great influential book for children.
5,Don't listen to the negative comments!,"Some people feel that dEUS have sold out with Ideal Crash, but don't listen to them. This is the sound of a band evolving and exploring new territory, and the payoff is fantastic. Like any great album, you need to truly listen, not just play it in the background. Give it some time, and this will become an indispensable recording in your collection. Every song has a different feel, much like their previous albums. However, this new record shows a more refined, focused band. Each song conveys a beauty much more prominent than on previous recordings. Just listen to the opening guitar on ""The Magic Hour"" and you'll understand. Don't pass this one up!"
5,a great cd!,"When you first listen the cd , you may think that it's not so good. But if you listen it after and after then you can't give it up! Instant Street is my favourite!I listen it maybe 10 times again and again! Ideal Crash and Sister Dew are the other succesfull ones. Everyone must get one!"
4,Great Surprise!,"It was a great surprise for me to find a band like Deus. Their music is fresh and inventive and their lirics paint a full picture in your head. The Ideal Crash is, from start to finish a whirlwind of new and interesting sounds. I had not heard a more elaborate (without pushing it) effort to make new music since Radiohead's OK Computer. The guilt ridden Sister Dew is haunting and the rest of the songs are full of melodious surprises, such as the uplifting Instant Street. Get this record!"
2,not to be used with flash,"Wide converter lenses normally make sense to be used indoors where space is limited. But the WC-DC52a can hardly be used there, because its big diameter results in a very big shadow on each flash-lighted foto (in addition the Powershot S1 IS doesn't support external flashlights).So buy this lens only when you want to use it outside!"
3,Item described is not item shown...,The item's description is not the item pictured. I ordered the potting bench after just looking at the picture. The item I got is much more like the potting bench with he lattice top and no covered tub area for potting dirt. It's nice - but be carful and check to see if it is the correct bench before putting it together. The item number and description of the item i got all match to order - it's just the wrong picture.
5,Geez,"Conservative's are the thinest skin people on earth, but the thick headedness also.The analogy in another review's comments about M. Moore ""misrepresenting history"" Yet, didn't Mr. Moore offer $10,000.00 if anybody could prove facts wrong or twisted!--9/11, Point is if you don't see issues in the vary same light as they do then your all these wonderful things they attribute to people who see's things differently, your, ignorant,dishonest,biased to a fault,muckrackers,etc,etc,etc.So the 1 star reviews are some of these very people they are---""People who when faced with the choice of changing one's mind or proving there's no need to do so, usually get busy on the ""proof"". THerefore their reviews are useless."
5,Definitely worth the read!!!!,"Wow, what a story!!! I will definitely read more novels written by Amy J. Fetzer. Victoria, a Bounty Hunter from the future and Chris, the Sheriff back from a Colorado town back in 1872 makes the perfect couple. Victoria got dragged back in time chasing a killer. The villain is evil and the wait for him to go down keeps you on the edge of your seats throughout the story. He's sharp (he sees through Victoria's many disguises), and though at a disadvantage against 20th century police know-how, he holds his own. Victoria and the Sheriff falls in love. The writing is absolutely superb. Great story. If you like time travel and historical romance, then this novel is definitely worth the read!!!! A very enjoyable read."
2,Not For Me,I didn't feel any great connection to the characters and felt the story overtook the book.
4,Great for the Money,"I bought these to measure dry chemicals. I wish they were labeled with the actual measurements instead of cutesy ""drop"" and ""pinch"" because those labels don't do me much good. I remember the measurements but I always second guess myself so I had to make a chart that I keep with the spoons.They are nice and sturdy and easy to clean. I knocked off a star because of the useless labels."
2,Very disappointed,"I bought these about a month ago. I was disappointed that one of the spoons was labeled ""hint"" instead of ""dash"" like the other ones which you can buy, but that was my fault, I guess, because I didn't read the description closely enough.But I was really disappointed because these ended up getting rusty on the handle after sitting in the dish drainer for a couple of days.I have another set (of 3, one of which is a dash) which I've had for months which has never gotten rusty. I'm very sorry that I purchased these."
3,a solid average,"useful tools, average quality.The bowl portion of my set were all bent at different angles and NONE of them had the top of the bowl flush with the handle (so that it's not possible to scrape off clean level measurements).that said they will do their job acceptably and i needed ' tsp size since my main set only went down to .somebody else figured out that these each are the size of the previous one so:1/8th1/16th1/32th1/64th.I will be putting on actual labels with my label makerYou won't be unsatisfied by the function, you may be less than awed by the form. They will 'get the job done'. I will keep them out of standing water based on other's comments about rusting.-awr"
3,It was okay...,"These measuring spoons were purchased to measure ingredients for skin care product. They were alright, kind of flimsy. Could be better."
2,These spoons didn't measure up!,"I bought these spoons hoping they would provide accurate measurements for certain meds I need to give my dog, ie, 1/16 of a tsp. However, once I received the spoons, I saw to my dismay that they have ""cutesy"" measurements, like ""pinch"" and ""hint."" These terms are very relative at best, anyway. I was looking for spoons that measure, rather than spoons to help me define references in recipes. I am still looking for spoons that measure REAL measurements. These were a waste."
2,Kalff - Limnology,My professors chose this book for a 4000/5000 level limnology class and it reads more like an undergraduate/high school text. I don't believe Kalff did a thorough job explaining concepts because he tried to oversimpifly the concepts. Wetzel's LIMNOLOGY is a much better text.
1,didn't work,"This product didn't work. Did not remove urine odor. Cat continued to urinate on carpet after it had been sprayed. Have tried other products,also & they didn't work either. Stubborn Cat!"
1,Misleading Information,Product was purchased in order to keep pets off of a certain item of furniture and the advertisement seemed to fit the bill. Instead it is a product to keep cats from spraying urine in a certain spot-------wasted my money!!!!
4,"Works, and doesn't stink!","I tried a few other products, and they really didn't work. Most of them also smelled horribly!This product works well, and it's smell isn't that bad at all! I did have to spray it nearly constantly to keep my cat away, but after a couple of weeks, he got the message and didn't need me to use it for a long time!"
2,Doesn't Work with our 4 Cats,Sorry to say that this product doesn't work with our 4 male cats. In fact they are attracted to the smell and spent a greta deal of time investigating the area where we used the product.
1,Awful Book,Not much of anything of worth here really. A rather embarrassing attempt at writing a book by someone who is clearly a legend in his own mind.
5,A book to share,"This is a book to share. ""It's o.k that you don't know...but once you DO know, you have a responsibly to share the information"""
2,Big Time Disappointment,"O'Reilly starts out strong as he describes his rise to fame but it doesn't take a genius to make a list of what's good, bad and ridiculous in America. He has some interesting perspective into certain issues but overall I'm struggling to find anything that I gained from this book."
1,I'm so sorry now that I helped fund Bill O'Reilly,"Ok. I admit it. I purchased this book for my Mother because she leans towards the right and I thought she would enjoy it (she didn't, particularly). I should have read it first without purchasing it. ARGHH! It's just more of the same conservative skewed look at life as they view it. I will keep looking for the fact-based conservative book. This wasn't it."
1,Poorly researched,"Like Mr. O'Reilly's television and radio shows, this book is brimming with facts that are either misleading or flatly untrue. A bit of checking on his sources serves to reveal the lengths to which he'll go in order to deliver something sensationally unbelievable: he simply makes it up.Whether Mr. O'Reilly's information is bad or he's deliberately misleading, anyone looking for an informed, factual read would be better off going elsewhere."
2,O'Reilly Really Loves O'Reilly,"When I finished this book I realized that there was no way I could love O'Reilly as much as O'Reilly loves O'Reilly. You cannot accept everything he writes as fact. Some good points, however."
3,Not all I had expected,"Perhaps it is because I am such a huge fan of The O'rielly Factor (TV show) that I had such high hopes for this book. I was let down however. We all know O'rielly is a great interviewer, but that doesn't mean his insight into every issue is necessarily correct. I found much of this book to be common sense, and the rest to be purely personal opinion. Which of course is fine if you are looking for O'rielly's opinion on a wide range of issues. If, on the other hand, O'rielly is not your first choice of people to ask for dating advice, then you too may be let down. Don't get me wrong, this is a good read, and O'rielly fans (and probably the haters too) will enjoy reading it. I was hoping for a thorough investigation and report on the American system. What I got was a bunch of opinions on a bunch of issues."
1,"Thought provoking, but too forcing","My main qualm with this book is how the author claims he is simply expressing his opinion, and says that each person is entitled to his opinion, however he will then slam you in the face (figuratevly speaking, did I spell that right) that his opinions are right, and that it does not matter what others think. He never will flat out say it, but he will make it clear that he does not care about other people's opinions and that the only right person is himself."
3,Pithy isn't the word,"As O'Reilly himself would put it, this book is pithy. Anyone on a reading level above the 8th grade may want to look for something with a little more substance. Is O'Reilly a simpleton? No, he's a Harvard graduate. He just seems to be dishing out common sense in a language that everyone can understand. The book is short; not even 200 pages. I would recommend it to teenagers and maybe young adults. However, anyone over the age of 22 should know this stuff already. If you are looking for informative and interesting social commentary for adults, I recommend ""The Ten Things You Can't Say in America"" by Larry Elder. This is much better reading material."
2,Stick to TV,"O'Reilly is entertaining on TV, but when you take away his interrupting privileges, he doesn't have as much to say as I had hoped. I read this book expecting Bill to expand upon the views he mentions on TV (Jesse Jackson, Hilary Clinton, etc.). I figured the television format just didn't give him enough time to articulate about these issues, and that the book would give him the time he needs to present a detailed argument. Bill doesn't even mention these issues till the last few chapters of the book, at which point he barely glosses over them. The bulk of the book consists of Bill telling the reader how to raise children and interact with friends. Bill really doesn't tackle any issues in this book. He's more interested in having a Hallmark moment with the reader. Despite my disappointment with the book, I will still enjoy watching Bill get into a good shouting match with Neil Cavuto."
1,A Valiant Ignorance,"To borrow a phrase from Shakespeare, O'Reilly displays ""a valiant ignorance"" in the writing of this completely ridiculous book."
1,The Control Freak Factor,People are not allowed to spin but O'Reilly is allowed.People are not allowed to omit truth but O'Reilly is allowed.People are not allowed to beat up other people but O'Reilly is allowed.People are not allowed to have selective memory but O'Reilly is allowed.People are not allowed to preach their philosophies but O'Reilly is allowed.
5,A True Patriot,"Every American patriot should buy a copy of this book and give them to their family members before the elections. You must make sure they read it, too. It is a great book! No one in your family will want to be a liberal after reading this book. He tells the truth in a way that no one can argue with. Also don't believe the sex lies that the liberals are putting in the news to ruin O'Reilly's reputation. If you watch his shows and read books like this then you will know that he is deeply religious and that he values his faith above all and because of this it is IMPOSSIBLE that any of these liberal sex lies are true. It is just a bunch of lies from the Kerry people who are a bunch of stupid idiots who want to destroy our freedoms and ruin the United States of A merica. Do yourself a favor and watch FOX only and boycott all the other channels. O'Reilly is a true Patriot."
1,Don't support him,"This guy is a jerk. His views tend to be extreme, selfish, and/or mean-spirited. He will tend to appeal to tough-guy types, who are failing and need a scapegoat.Send a message that his hate, lies and ugliness are not acceptable by not buying this book. (Buy Franken's book about him instead -- more accurate, enlightening, and much more fun to read!)."
4,O'Reilly Rules,"Just like his other books, this one is classic O'Reilly. Whether he makes you mad or you agree with everything he says, O'Reilly has many valid points about America and it's RULERS. Great Stuff, as usual."
1,Worst of the Sixties,"Hey, Woodstock Generation! Remember in the mid sixties when you were starting to grow your hair and explore new frontiers, the uptight conservative teenagers in short sleeved button down shirts who sneered ""are you a boy or a girl"" while leering at your sweet braless companion? Or the a**hole crewcut high school coach who'd been a clerk in the army and hated the peace movement? Well, that's Bill O'Reilly in a nutshell: arrogant, ignorant, vicious, cowardly, sucking up to the rich and successful while putting down anything different. Surely nobody looks up to this clown as any sort of moral authority; his sole appeal is that he publicly airs and shares the narrow, bigoted, hateful attitudes of his miserable viewers."
3,"""Here A Friend There A Friend""?","Bill: I am always amazed with your argumentive state of mind, and your abilities to calm them when you have pushed someone to the limit. now for review, I found the book to be interesting, although at sometimes somewhat boring, because you ""after all"" could have made alot of unmade points about your charactors thatwere left undone.lora--Parkersburg, WV"
4,As un-PC as it gets,"Bill O'Reilly creates a vision of life that most of his critics hate simply because it contains too much unpleasant truth. This is what makes his show so thought provoking and interesting even when you disagree with him. The life stories included in the book are also interesting, and on a wide range of topics, not just politics.And while his opinions are all over the place, even sometimes (gasp) liberal, he usually backs them up with evidence. A fine effort from the toughest interviewer out there."
5,A good blueprint. But some people can't handle the truth.,"Okay, this isn't the absolute truth, it's a matter of opinion. I am 24 years old and just had one of the biggest shocks and upsets of my life. If only I could have read this book 6 years ago! Well, I'm young enough still that I can do a lot with my life and Bill really creates a great blueprint for that. If you don't agree with it, fine, but some of the media critics hate it because it contains a lot of truth. Bill, we need a sequel."
4,"I confess, I'm an O'Reilly addict....","...so how could I not read his latest and greatest? It's very well done, esp. if you want an overview of O'Reilly's perspective on everything in life. He has a great writing style I think, very much like the way he speaks on his show. He fancies himself to be an ""independent"", but I do think he has right leanings which is fine by me. Buy this book and read it in a day. Help out Bill who doesn't want to lose his high ranking on the bestseller's list. ;)"
1,Riduculous? You have no idea.,"There's very little that's more ridiculous in American life than authors like Billy here. How can you seriously have any sense of self worth, when you live off the hatred you breed around the world?"
5,On the Mark in many Ways,"Yes, he is opinionated, but he is also truthful about our country and its moral fiber. Whether he is a liberal or a conservative, it doesn't really matter, as he has many splendid ideas to offer in helping our country get back on track. Thank you, Bill. It does indeed take a family, not a village."
3,Entertaining...,"Bill O'Reilly's book is pretty similar to his television show. Many of the points he makes seem to be pretty much common sense, but of course there are many people in America that seem to lack that basic virtue. Most of the book is entertaining and good but the chapter on the Child Factor is excellent and should be required reading for all people who intend to have children or do have them!"
3,The O'Reilly Factor,"I watch O'Reilly every night and I recommend this book to everyone, young and old. He is one of the few in the newsmedia not afraid to ""tell it as he sees it."" He is a hero to me!!"
5,book,"a good book that tells (sadly, and goodly) the truth of what america is really like. i really liked it a lot and i also watch the show. its kinda cool how it iterupts with little bulletins with ""this just in"" with famous qoutes."
1,O'Reilly -- Completely Ridiculous Gasbag,"The biggest difference I can see between Bill O'Reilly and the Big Fat Idiot is that Rush is by his own admission addicted to drugs that have seriously altered his behavior and thinking patters over the years. We don't know what exactly it is that makes O'Reilly so idiotic, but who cares.O'Reilly publishes a lot of books because the same 500 people buy them, then some nut group buys a skid full and gives them away as door stops at the meetings of the local Bund.Please Gasbag O'Reilly. Sue some more people like Franken. Show you've got cojones and stick it out there -- so you can get it cut off like Franken whacked you. You got laughed out of court and we'll all still laughing at your supreme silliness.Get the Nazi Broadcasting folks to back you again ... so you can demonstrate just how ridiculous you are. No content. Just noxious air moving through the rectum from a liar who stands up then and points a finger at someone else."
1,Not Impressed,"I checked this book out at the library out of curiosity because I had seen O'reilly on tv and always wondered how such a rude person could represent a news station. I wasn't impressed any further after reading this book. This book is just more of his close-minded ideas. On tv he cuts people off when they are presenting the facts, this is not accurate news. I go to the news for facts, and I look at peoples records of what they have done. I don't recommend this book unless you are just curious what makes this guy tick."
3,He's not that bad for a conservative,"I like Bill O'Reilly though I consider myself a staunch liberal. He is always using truth and is not blinded by partisan idiotics like Sean Hannity or Rush Limbaugh. I tink he could tone down the Clinton bashing though. Sure Clinton didn't take many risks or push things forward while president, but hey, while he was in office the economy was great, we weren't locked in a bloodbath war without any help, and we weren't under constant fear. The same cannot be said about our current president."
1,"Go, Bill","It's a shame other news interviewers do not tune into Fox News and learn from Bill O'Reilly, the master. I am so sickened by questioners such as Jim Lehrer of PBS who ask probing, incisive questions with no heavy dollop of either sarcasm or attitude. Where is the entertainment value in that? O'Reilly's book is, like his show, short on insight and facts, but loaded with warm, nourishing bluster. Go, Bill! Really."
1,Bias and ignorant,"After listing to this mans show talk about something that I actually have knowledge of, it brings to light how horribly bias and ignorant this man really is"
1,gr,"What a pos this book is. No wonder o reily put out a new one every month. They're all crap. Please stop buying his books, he plays a character on TV, he's Harvard educated, even he doesn't believe the crap he spouts. He doesn't even write these books he hires interns to write them."
1,You should get paid to read this book...,"This guy is a clown! This must honestly be the worst read of my life. Is like buying a really big brochure to his TV program with a lot of non-sense into it. If you have no self-respect and beliefs of your own, then but this book and install O'reilly's ""stupidiest"" beliefs in your mind. Otherwise, read something else at least for respect to your time."
5,A breath of fresh air,"No, Bill O'Reilly may not be perfect, and he may not be polite (at least not all the time), but at least he is honest. We are at a time when we all need to be honest and say things like HEY, public aid isn't working, politics is broken with a bunch of self serving rich lawyers (who really care very little about the middle or lower class), and the supposed charity system also isn't what it seems.O'Reilly cuts beyond the usual rhetoric that we are blasted with every day and gives us some hard facts. I also liked that the facts are usually backed up by numbers. Yes, this book has a great deal to do with O'Reilly's opinions on the subjects he deals with, but at least it is an informed opinion, and not a bunch of self-serving bull hockey. I appreciate that.Thanks Mr. O'Reilly, and keep up the good work."
3,The Factor in print,"There's something reassuring about Bill O'Reilly on his Fox News show, The O'Reilly Factor. He views things in black or white, right or wrong, with little in-between. You know where you stand with him - whether you agree or disagree. There's no beating around the bush.His book is much in the same vein, except with personal history and opinions thrown in.Some of his rants are hard to swallow, especially if you fit into one of the categories he's ranting about. For instance, I drive an SUV and had to roll my eyes at his comments about SUV drivers.He repeatedly throws about his working-class parentage and background. I have read somewhere about how many millions he makes at Fox News as well as his going price for being a keynote speaker. The guy is raking it in now, so the working-class hero stuff gets old fast.However, he's worked hard to get where he is - so more power to him.As for the book, if you enjoy his show, you'll get a kick out of the book, too."
3,Overly Pedantic,"Bill O'Reilly is terrific as the host of the O'Reilly Factor. He's a good interviewer who doesn't suffer fools gladly or put up with prevarication. This book, however, is something of a let down. Sure, there are a few sections where he recounts interview segments and/or comments on celebrities or politicians, but for the most part this book is filled with antecdotes from Bill's life and his alternately witty/smug observations. These could be interesting but they're smothered by his tendency (at least in this book) to talk down to the reader. Overall, the book is an easy read, somewhat amusing, occasionally insightful, and entirely preachy. If you like that kind of thing, check it out. It was too much for me or too little."
3,Factor Fans will be Disappointed,The lukewarm reviews are correct. O'Reilly departs from the style his pithy talking points memo in writing that reads like a memoir at best and like incoherent ramblings at worst. Those who watch his show for its freshness will find the subject matters drab. Those who watch his show for its news commentary will fund this book irrelevant. His show gets 5 stars. But buy Larry Elder's The Ten Things You Can't Say in America instead.
1,"Very, very, simple and uncontroversial","I was hoping O'Reilly would take a stand on some controversial topics, but instead his book contains mostly advice that absolutely no one in the solar system would ever disagree with. Don't do drugs, keep your promises, and save money. These little jems are certainly important, but Nancy Reagan, Mom, and Uncle Whoever have already told us.BTW Bill - I don't care whether or not you like Chinese food or the Doors. Nobody cares. Your book was a big disappointment"
4,I would recommend this book....,"I would definitely recommend this book, even if you do not agree with many of O'Reilly's viewpoints. I think that this book has a very strong voice, and due to some of the controversial topics that he discusses and his very strong, and obviously unyielding opinions, the text encourages the reader to think about aspects in American life that are being dealt with and experienced daily. Though his organization is not extremely clear, the book is still easy to read and not too difficult to follow. His points are rather blatant and his direct tone is a refreshing change from the typical, politically correct and sugar coated text that is often read in other political literature. He also includes many personal stories to add to his opinions, which sometimes make him seem egoistical, but also makes the book more personal and more enjoyable to read."
5,WOW Sums up American Society,"The book was very interesting. I read it pretty much in one sitting and it talks about everything in society. He breaks it up in different categories such as class, media, race, dating, etc. The book was funny and made me think a lot and for the fans of the show I think they will love it."
2,very thin book,"You won't get a lot of reading out of this bookette.At just over 200 pages it doesn't justify the price.But on to the minimal content,O'Reilly is supposed to be amusing and insightful,but this book doesn't give much evidence of either.Basically banal,a mile wide and an inch deep,the book is an ode to irrelevence and someone cashing in on their 15 minutes of fame.His observations of class,politics and the like are pretty much on the mark,but he reveals absolutely nothing we didn't already know.It is a fairly enjoyable read but not anything worth reading twice."
1,a ridiculous read is what it is,"Perhaps never, in the history of mankind, has anyone written such a lousy book. I now feel I must rip my eyes out lest I receive another like it."
3,It was right to the point,"I liked this book because it's just like the show, clear and to the point. It was also entertaining because of Mr. O'Reilly's humor. I identified really well with most of his opinions, althogh it got really drab because it was lacking a lot of outside opinions. In short the reader only reads about his point of the argument."
1,The elevator doesn't go all the way up,"Although I agree with some of O'Reilly's opinions and disagree with many of his conclusions, this book is ultimately a flop. It is a book of great width but no depth. O'Reilly rants about his likes and dislikes, but provides little supporting information, no evidence or research, and zero philosophical support for his positions. Take religion, for example. Here is a chapter that is not worthy of the ink it took to print it. O'Reilly proudly proclaims faith in a deity because there's just too darn much stuff science can't explain. That's it. That's as deep a thought as he can muster. To use such a flimsy premise as justification for worhsip of an invisible power reveals how shallow and ludicrous O'Reilly's logic is. Such thinking places him just one step ahead of those who once sacrificed virgins to appease the volcano gods. No thank you, Mr. O'Reilly."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,Bill O'Reilly's too pompous to enjoy in print. Don't waste your time like I did on this book!
3,So-so book by TV commentator,"This book was somewhat autobiographical, for the most part. Some of the stories are boring, while others are fairly exciting. Politically speaking, Mr. O'Reilly offers some good insights and solutions to some problems that face society today. Religiously speaking, a large portion of his opinions are contrary to the teachings of the Catholic Church. I got kinda of bored during the middle of the book, reading it for the sake of finishing the book, and no other, but he regained my attention during the last three or four chapters."
1,Do not waste your time.,"This man gives all right wingers in America a bad name. A real bad name. This book is filled with nothing but lies and ridiculously partisan opinions that don't seem to find any basis in reality. I don't know who to feel worse for: O'Reilly for being such a hypocritical egomaniac with no heart, or me for wasting my time reading this book."
1,The Over Simplification Factor,"This book is very simple and has few ideas. The negative is that one doesn't get much out of reading it. On the positive side, one can read it extremely quickly. In fact, you can read about 5 pages and you will pretty much have the content of the entire book mastered. You might enjoy this book if you find self congratulation by the author to be of interest. Too simple and boring for me."
4,Great reading!,"If you enjoy Bill O'Reilly's ""The O'Reilly Factor"" on television, you'll enjoy reading this book. It is very easy reading. I didn't want to put it down. He speaks in layman's terms and covers many facets of the news, throwing in his views (of course). He really gets you thinking on both sides of the topic and has a way of persuading you to agree with his views. He gets you to open your eyes and see the picture.I love his style of writing. It's more like a discussion than a narrative documentary. I look forward to reading other books of his."
3,Entertaining,"Some of O'Reilly's points are very well-made, and his point of view is interesting on some topics. The verbiage and writing style throughout the book are a bit simple (which may appeal to some). Overall, I enjoyed the book. The book seems to be a autobiography as much as anything else. Take out all the anecdotes and O'Reilly's ""I had it so tough"" life stories, and the book would be much shorter. Perhaps, however, this gives perspective to his ideas. I enjoyed Larry Elder's book more-""Ten Things You Can't Say in America"" (though it's a bit more scholary)."
3,Balancing Act,"I think Bill is a master at balancing what he wants to say with what he has to say in order to keep a large following. He knows his inconsistencies are just that, but he has obviously read ""The 48 Laws of Power"" so he knows that if he admits he's libertarian he'll lose the audience that he's desperately trying to wean. Bill should read ""The Illuminati Manifesto"" asap."
1,Demagoguery,"First off, I'm not a foe of O'Reilly nor am I a fan of his or his show on Fox news. I rate this book poorly because it is of the same nature as his program. It's predictable and totally composed of recycled themes and right wing slogans (you can predict the whole book just by reading the first chapter). Its virtually an amalgam of bumper stickers. There's nothing wrong with being conservative, as long as you've reasons for that viewpoint, but this is mindless composition of the lowest calibre. Unless you can't get enough of his shtick, don't buy this book. You'll find nothing provocative or interesting in it. This work is for those who only wish to read things which well reinforce their a priori views. As such, it is worthless."
1,O'Reilly should just stick to television,"As a regular viewer of ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" I appreciate Bill's no-nonsense, direct style. He's one of the best interviewers on television, and I enjoy watching him. Reading his book, however, was a waste of my time.In this book, Bill is preachy and unimaginative. He advises us not to disclose our sex life to the world. He tells parents to discipline their children. He reminds us that materialism can be bad. He rarely stays on a topic for more than a page, and he writes at a third-grade level (if you have ever read any of his weekly columns, you'll understand). In short, save your money."
1,They wouldn't let me leave 0 stars...,"Honestly, I would really love to hear that apollogy you owe us ALL Bill. I guess you're far too much of a coward to live up to your word..."
1,"Love the Show, but this book is ebay fodder.","I love ""The Factor"" and O'Reilly's in your face ""factor this"" style, but this book left me hanging. I was under the delusion that this book would talk about politics and current issues of the day. But this book seems to be confused in its focus. At times it is biographical giving details of his work history, and his upbringing, which to be honest I found the first chapters of this book to be depressing. Then it drifts off into what I guess is suppossed to be issues, but he really takes no stand either way. His chapter on Religion is the most wishy washy hogwash I've ever seen. And finally this book ends with a high school like who's cool and who's not list. Which includes everyone from Madonna to The Grateful Dead. Anyway I'll stick to the show which is definately more exciting than this book which I have determined will become what I call ebay fodder."
1,A mistake,"O'Reilly's big mistake was in making his book just like his T.V. show. Journalistic writing and pithy T.V. talking head shows are two differnet things. This was his chance to prove his journalistic integrity and maybe flash some of that Harvard education. However, this man is not stupid. He was smart enough to know he could cash in on the vulgar and ignorant masses. This book was a disappointment."
1,"The O'Reilly Factor: The Good, Bad, and completely Ridic....",You will be disappointed if you hoped to see less of the emotional and bombastic TV performance and more of a demonstration of well written jounalism to counter the stilted TV personality. If being mean spirited and bitter works as a life style for you then this should be an entertaining book to read and justify your own predjudices. Even the issues I agree with the author about made me feel I really need to rethink my beliefs given the narrow minded logic employed by O'Rielly. Certainly not a book that will be remembered in history as thoughtfull.
1,Tell me something I don't know.,"Too bad OReily didn't have a good Editor. He could have said it all in 1,200 words or less. OReily reveals nothing new and is down right boring. I have seen better written, edited and formated books by self publishers."
1,"Scary populist, not a conservative","I bought this book to get a better insight into O'Reilly. I try to watch his show but Fox News is such an overproduced Hollywood monstrosity I can hardly stand it. On the plus side it sometimes takes a more conservative view of the news (though far less than people would have you believe). I had been given the impression that O'Reilly was the new face of conservative commentary in America and I bought this book to see what he had to say.Let's make this short: O'Reilly is about as conservative as Stalin. Just because he bashes liberals like Clinton doesn't make him a conservative. If you listen to his actual politics he's as far left as they come. So what if he more of a national socialist, whereas the Clintons are international socialist. The are both morally bankrupt concepts that do not deserve the time or attention of true freedom loves.Take it from me and skip this one."
2,Disappointing...,"O'reilly has a very interesting and semi-informative newsprogram. This book is not interesting and not informative. Hisblatent plugs for his novel and his TV show went way overboard. Iexpected a book about the subjects he discusses on his shows. I waslet down. Instead I heard O'Reilly continually trying to claim he isworking class. ...There are a few good chapters where he deals withcurrent affairs and politics but the bulk of it is ""How to lead abetter full-filling life"". Stick to politics O'Reilly. NOTHINGlike the Factor new program."
1,SURPRISINGLY BAD,"Although Bill O'Reilly seems to be a decent individual, I was thoroughly disappointed with this book. Most surprising is that Bill O'Reilly could have gotten as far as he did in the journalism business while being such an aweful writer. I try to finished every book I start even if it's not all that enjoyable to read, especially if I'm going to criticize it later. But I've read several different books by political writers all over the spectrum, and Bill O'Reilly's book is by far the least enjoyable to read and certainly among the least inciteful or profound. An alternative title for this book could be 'A list of Bill O'Reilly's opinions excluding any significant analysis or reasoning'. This was a BORING, UNENJOYABLE book. If you feel you must buy this book because it is too important not to read you're mistaken as I was, but buy a used copy so you can save a buck. Whatever you spend it's too much!"
1,Where did this writing style come from?,"I must say, first of all, that I am a semi-quasi fan of Bill O'Reilly's FOXNews show, The Factor.However, when it came to deciphering his ramblings in book form, I must say that I grew quite confused. I never finished the book, I wasn't able to.Mr. O'Reilly jumped from topic to topic, point to point, and then back again so quickly I was unable to derive the logic of the book.What may work on Television, which I usually enjoy, just did not cut it for me in written form.At some point, I hope to be able to finish the work, but I must say it will have to be at a point and time in my life where thoughts and logic run awry."
1,An Outright Fraud,"I have to admit to being a little let down. After reading the lawsuit filed against O'Reilly at the Smoking Gun in which it is claimed O'Reilly subjected his co-worker to repeated instances of sexual harassment and spoke often, and explicitly, to her about phone sex, vibrators, threesomes, masturbation, the loss of his virginity, and sexual fantasies. Knowing of O'Reilly's tastes I was willing to shuck out a few dollars for his take on the ""completely ridiculous in American life""...unfortunately all I got was this smug litany of the usual right wing gripes with the usual disregard for context and proportion. Indeed I say this book is an outright fraud since Bill apparently had more interesting stories to tell than this pious hokum."
2,"Gossip, self-help and 6'4'' of egolatry","Factor in : Gossip, self-help and 6'4'' of egolatry. If you like it or if you need it you're going to find it on the book.You can think about the book as an eight hour long O'Reilly show without guests.I read it thinking that as it comes from a journalist it would have some interesting information. Instead it's opinionated. I'm happy I could borrow it for free from the library. I would hate have spent my money on it.Anything good? Well, I kind of like the way he ridicules the SUVs.Leonardo Alves - December 2000"
3,"Self-serving, mere opinions, dishonest to himself","At the beginning of the Audio CD, Bill claims to not be right-wing, or libertarian, but as any mature adult by CD #2 of 5 will be able to deduce, Bill is quite right-wing and quite conservative in his views.CD#5 toward the last 20-25mins is unbearable. It is just a laundry list of his opinions (e.g. about celebrities mostly), that anybody could spew in the same fashion, and he presumes that the listener is already hanging on every word and judgment Bill is making. He did not back up his views, and definitely lost points with me for writing so much filler in his book. Marginal 3 stars out of 5."
3,Not as exciting as hyped,"O'Reilly has a good attitude and takes the moral high-ground. I liked his values and opinions. I do think he took a little poetic license when recalling his childhood and it may not have been as tough as he wanted one to think. His book is similar to his television show, he gets you worked up on a topic and then leaves you flat without giving his thoughts on a solution."
4,The O'Reilly Factor,Very Enjoyable book if you are moderate Middle of the Road to Conservative with the extra Common Sense Gene! If you are Ted Kennedy or Hillary Clinton you will probably whine just a little more than normal if you even finish the book. Bill pulls no punches and speaks the truth.
4,Interesting,"Although this is not one of his favorites, my husband found this interesting. He enjoys watching O'Reilly on TV often."
3,Alright book from O' Reilly,"This is a very good political book. I enjoy watching his talk shows, especially during when the elections were going on. This book is great. It discusses current issues like sex, drugs, parents, etc. But the book gets a bit old after awhile because O'Reilly is so arrogant, claiming so on and so forth how he is the greatest reporter alive. After about 10 chapters, i was pretty burnt out from reading it. but it does have some good material and points out some good things, and bashes people like Jesse Jackson and Hillary Clinton. I reccomend this book if you like his talk show or show an interest in the politcal field. otherwise, stay away from it."
5,Brutally Candid,"Perfect book. While I can see how some people may react to O'Reilly in the sense that he is very frank and speaks his mind, this book was refreshingly charming and open in how it deals with the state of politics, cultural, interpersonal relations, child-rearing and how life in America was once lived. Basing a lot of his opinions, of course, on his experiences, O'Reilly is precise and to the point. Bing. Bang. Done. It's playful and deadly serious at the same time. And it's a nice read, allowing you to think, to murmur, to ""tisk-tisk"", and to respectfully disagree. Kudos."
1,Far cry from the O'Reilly factor,"I get the impression that somebody may be ghost writing books for Bill. I personally agree with him on some of the points, but disagree on many others. Although Bill claims to be a true conservative, many of his statements do not agree with what America is all about"
1,truth,"This book is revolting. I ordered for a second perspective on the current state of affairs, and literally vomited all over the pages after the first chapter. Of course, this made returning it very difficult. Save yourself the trouble, and don't order this masterpiece of bigotry and pure ignorance. The world will look back on this book as an embarrassment of human kind."
5,you're about to enter a no spin zone!,"from the most powerful man in primetime comes this great book, that is a quick read, mainly because you just can't put it down. as always, o'reilly doesn't hold back! but far from just the political issues that dominate ""the factor"", o'reilly also takes a look at other important social issues, like dating and friendship. here is my own ""most ridiculous item of the day""; that people still think of him as a memeber of the ""vast right wing conspiracy""! get real people! the reason bill o'reilly is numero uno is because, as always, he is fair and balanced. good job o'reilly!"
4,O'Reilly Factor,"I'm normally not interested in books other than theology, history, or philosophy. Of course this book doesn't fit any of these categories, yet I enjoyed reading it because it lead me to think further on each issue. Each chapter of the book focuses on an issue without going too far into it. It's brief and too the point. That way, I was able to read what he said and think for myself. O'Reilly said himself that he is an independent thinker, and I believe this book encourages us to be as well. He tells us what he thinks, and we decide what we think. One other thing I appreciated about The O'reilly Factor is that it is written in a way that keeps your attention. Several times I heard myself lauph out loud."
5,More words from the king of straight talk.,"Mr. O'Reilly's TV show has us glued to our sets nightly for his honest, frank and pragmatic views on the culture we share. Now, these thoughts are available in book form, and his penchant for slaughtering every one of our sacred cows continues. He doesn't pick political sides either, heading right up the middle in his efforts to lambaste both Democrats and Republicans with equal venom. Take that Martha Stewart! Take that Bill Clinton! Take that hypocrisy and bipartisanism! There's someone new on the scene, and he's talking loud, and he's telling the truth!"
1,"the idea is excellent, it pulls corks faultlessly but breaks","For just over a year I simply adored this way of opening all my bottles of great French wine. It coped equally well with both new corks and old crumbly ones. However one of the plastic parts then broke and it was completely useless so in view of the very high cost I cannot recommend it and have gone back to struggling with my old, cheap but reliable corkscrews."
2,Item failed within two months,"I bought the unit after reading these glowing reviews. At first, it performed (very well) as advertised. But it started to operate with ""a screw loose"". I couldn't fix it, and after a disaster where wine splashed all over, the unit hit the round file."
2,Screwpull Lever Model Wine Opener review,"My wife and I love the product when it's operating properly; however, the problem enters when the corkscrew wears in that you can't find replacements at retailers who sell the Screwpull product. This is obviously an integral part to the operation of the unit so even though I have enjoyed the product I wouldn't buy it again because of this difficulty."
1,Great for the first few months.......then breaks,This is just not worth the price. The plastic parts need to be all metal as the plastic quickly wears and the opener ceases to work correctly. Wouldn't buy another one. My recommendation.......spend your money on some good bottles instead.
5,A must have for wine drinkers,"I have owned this model for years (and given it as gifts) and it is by far the most versatile opener I have had. It has a ""wow"" factor when guests see me use it. Simple design, and requires little effort to open a bottle. No twisting, tugging, pulling or damaged corks with this opener."
1,Don't bother,"Worked fine for about a dozen bottles, then broke. Same thing happened with one my mother-in-law bought for herself. I would not recommend."
1,Broke after limited use,"My Screwpull Lever model broke after opening roughly 40 bottles over 1+year. Locked up and when I pulled a little harder it stripped a gear (the notches into which the gear meshes are only plastic.)I suspect the lockup during the twist-cork-in -then-lift-up cycle was due to worn part within the screw housing.In any event, it's unacceptable for something this expensive to fail withsuch limited use. At the very least, the gear mechanism should be stainless steel vice metal-plastic to provide better wear.Plus, we just talking about a stupid corkscrew. How hard /costly would it be to build something decent vice a piece of overpriced yuppy crap??"
5,"Fastest, neatest way to open a bottle of wine","I received this as a gift last year, and I love it! Myprevious favorite was the Screwpull pocket model, but this one is much more fun. Works well on most any cork, except an old, disintegrating cork. Your friends who have not seen this wine opener in action before will think it is a fun parlor trick."
3,"Avoid this release; get ""Singles""","An incoherent hodgepodge. No logical track order on this or the related Smiths Best II. The songs are good, but for a two-CD set, Sire records has criminally overlooked some of their best tracks. Still, mediocre Smiths is still better than great Bon Jovi."
5,The best of 80's alternative,"The Smiths back in 1982 helped pave the way for the British alternative music scene. Being only 2 when their debut self titled album came out I have only recently been able to appreciate the influence they have made on modern day alternative music.I bought this album as an introduction to the Smiths and Morrisey, and I have to say I was very impressed with what I heard. It's hard to find a bad song on the album - panic, hand in glove and half a person are my personal favourites.I agree with other reviewers who say this album is a good introduction to the Smiths, I am now in the process of getting all their albums. Buy this you won't be disappointed."
5,simply wonderful,"You know you're listening to a great lyricist when the words of a song run through your head, but you've completely forgotten the tune in the process. Morrissey's songs here are not only intelligent, but simply hilarious. This is my first Smiths experience and I can't wait to buy more of their discography."
2,Keys for midgets,The keys are so small you still have to use the stylus. J/K but really they are tiny and it causes you to mistype alot. However it is very well built and seem like it would last a long time.
5,Excellent Mini Keyboard!!!,"I really like this keyboard, very useful since I don't like to use the Grafitti text input method because I think that I'll scratch my screen (I really take a lot of care to not scratch my screen).Highly recommended!!!"
5,The Best Reason NOT To Have Atomic Weopons,"I first read this book when I was living in Spain in the 1980's. It gripped me from the first page and held me until well after I had finished it. Since returning to the UK I have re-read the book several times.I feel this book should, no MUST be read by every politician and military leader who has their finger on the ""button"". If it doesn't make them stop and think of the consequences of what their actions could do then they do not deserve to be in the position of power and trust that they are."
4,A different take on Nuclear War,"I found this book at a local library, and it caught my eye. I took it home and I was suprised. It is not your typical Nuclear War book. It takes place some years after a Limited Nuclear exchange between Russia and the United States. It follows two men, and there journey across whats left of the United States.They interview a number of different people all across the country and find out what effect the war had on them and there communties.I thought the idea of the US becoming basically a divided Third World Country interesting, and kind of disturbing.This book isnt for action lovers though. There isnt any action in it, but it wasnt written to be a action book.It is smart and well written, and I highy recommend it."
5,A realistic look at a post-collapse America,"While Warday was written in the 1980's as a speculation on what would become of America in the event of a limited nuclear war, it's actually an honest, accurate glimpse of how our country and other countries would behave after a collapse of the American system. If you substituted ""economic collapse"" or ""environmental catastrophe"" for ""nuclear war"", then this book would be an excellent study one our nation's fragility and lack of preparation for disaster. Warday shows us a broken America without all the illusions of wealth and power we cling to today. It shows us an America incapable of securing its own borders or maintaining its own infrastructure. It shows is a fractured, fragmented America set upon by former allies bent not on assistance, but merely strip-mining the last of our resources as some sort of payback for years spent tolerating our outlandish behavior.Warday doesn't show us a future America. It shows us America now."
4,Dated but chilling,"Yes, the book was written in 1985, and it's definately slanted to the left, but it is still a chilling story that seems more relevant with our current political climate. You may find yourself wishing for a bright side to this story. Maybe you can find one, because I couldn't. I believe that Strieber was able to get his point across, however."
1,this WILL happen if we deploy a shield,The terrifying thing about warday is it envisages the inevitable result of what would happen if the US tried to put a system in place that could stop a russian attack. any russian premier would be criminally negligent not to launch an attack before it was deployed. ask yourself; would the US allow Russia to get in a position where it could destroy the US without retaliation? of course not. with the latest attempt to launch a missile defense system we are back to the dangerous 80s.
4,Very well thought out book,"Another reviewer was right, there really is nothing to compare this book to. It details the journey of two journalists in a post nuclear US.The level of detail is impeccable, as is the way the book goes to lengths to show the human side of the war. The ""interview"" sections of the book were great, letting each person give their own experience of the war and aftermath is thought provoking.Whether you like the post-apocalyptic genre or not, you should give this book a chance. It's fiction, but not sci-fi by any stretch of the imagination. Very much a ""What if?"" book. It stays with you."
4,Solid,"This is a solid project by a group that continues to churn out solid projects. Front Range is a very good group from the western U.S. that has been churning out fine CDs for years.Bob Amos is a very good songwriter and he has become known for writing songs of mystery and death (life after death) and ""Silent Ground"" is one of his best. This song was written in the tradition of ""Long Black Veil"" and it is great. Telling a story of a love that has died and the eternal love that still lives between them. ""Dust Devil"" is a great instrumental that showcases the band.This is a good CD and if you like bluegrass you will enjoy this band."
2,Can't hear Whitney's voice at all!,"I have to admit that Whitney's mother is a GREAT singer. I really think so. I expected that Whitney sang duets with her mother, like ""I know him so well"" in her 2nd solo album. But she was just a back vocalist here. And I can't hear her voice. I'm really disappointed. I like Cicy. But this album is not what I expected. SORRY!"
1,DON'T BUY IT,This is a Cissy album with Whitney singing back-up. You can barely hear Whitney. Whoever marketed this was very deceptive. It is a complete waste of money unless you are buying it for Cissy.
5,MY LOVE IS YOUR LOVE,"Whithney is a gift sent from above, she is the best. The song blew me totally away,it is amazing."
3,Secrets of grave doubts,"This book was about two boys that thought that it was kind of strange that a millionaire like Otis Canby could just die. So the two boys, Lester Cunningham and Wally Brenner went to investigate this mystery. They both soon new that a ""certain"" boy did everything for his millionaire uncle but got nothing for it, while his uncles nephew gave him nothing but grief, but still was put in his uncles will for millions of dollars. So a boy finally got sick of it and...I kind of liked this book, it was suspenseful and has some things that you wouldn't expect."
5,As important as the three R's!,"O.K. - MORE important than the three R'S. I say this as my brother, who knew his three R's enough to graduate and work in his field as a physician, now, after 21 years, sits on the other side of the planet - ""meditating"". We have all his school stuff - very impressive - but he doesn't have himself, I don't believe.MAYBE had he been schooled in the material of this book...........like my children certainly are. Thank you Conway and Siegelman !!!!!!!!"
5,As important as the three R's!,"O.K. - MORE important than the three R'S.

Thank you Conway and Siegelman !!!!!!!!"
2,Too Hard,Why do developers contiue to insist that the best games are virtually impossable to complete? Instead of using pro-gamers as play testers they should use regular people. The game looks good and plays well but unless your a vidio games freak you wont be able to get your moneys worth out of this game.
2,"Ok, but not great","Compared to the other Tomb Raider games in the series, this one is somewhat of a disappointment. Yes there are more weapons and moves, but the difficulty level is much too high. You might find yourself in the middle of a level saying, ""Uh..where do I go?"". It's nearly impossible to know the routes through the levels without some kind of game guide. Also, some levels require you to travel very far to find one item or key or switch, then walk ALL the way back to the beginning to use it. This makes the levels tedious and boring. The cut scenes look pretty bad as far as graphics go. Very square. The heads bob when characters talk, but the mouths don't move! Pretty funny actually. The enemies are pretty cool though, especially the raptors and crocodiles. The music is cool, and the plot is kind of interesting. I wouldn't recommend this game unless you are a die-hard Lara Croft fan and absolutely must see her gigantic---well, you know."
3,"Good game, but the worst of the first 3 Tomb Raiders","After the pure joy given us by the first 2 Tomb Raider games, perhaps the 3rd in the series had expectations that were impossible to meet. The entire series is still the class of action/adventure games, but for folks new to the series, I recommend either of the first two games MUCH more."
3,Fun...Sometimes,"It's not that this game is bad, it's just too hard. The levels consist of timed events e.g. flip a switch and run to the other end of the level before a door closes.The graphics are good as is the music. The story is non-existent though. Something about aliens, and it includes one of the worst and shortest endings in all of Video Game history.It's fun yet frustrating.Graphics: 8/10Sound: 7/10Control: 7/10Fun: 4/10"
2,Annoying!,"I love all of the tomb raider games but this one was really bad. The most frustrating aspect of this game are the saving crystals.Unlike all the other game where you just go to the pasport at will, you must collect crystals in order to save. This did not increase the difficulty of the game at all. I just found it annoying. I returned it to the store and got Tomb Raider The Last Revelation which I am very happy with."
1,Tomb Raider III Galactics Review,"I was so happy when I ordered a new Tomb Raider III video game, and received it on time. When I received my package, and opened it, I was very disappointed because my product was damaged and looked like it had been stomped on by children. This was my first time ever ordering merchandise online by Amazon for Galactics. I can say on honestly, on a positive note Amazon and Galactics resolved my issue immediately which I appreciate very much. I wish I had the opportunity to play the game I always wanted as a child."
4,"The hardest in the TR series, but still fun","TR3 presents itself as the programmers appearing to show off. Game play is fun, and it is easy to master. The analog control on PSX stinks, though. The only useful part is using the right stick to look around. Trying to move with the left is almost impossible. I am currently playing TR's 2, 3, and 4. When I get stuck on one, I go to another. TR3 is the only one I have ever had to buy a strat. guide for. It is much harder than the rest of the series. They did recover the folly with TR4, though. All in all, it is a very fun, and still realistic game. I am 3/4 of the way through it, and still loving it."
3,this is tough,"I have to admit that the level of intensity in TR3 is excellent. However, I took months just to get out of Level 1! Fortunately, I had the strategy guide, which really helped me with the tricks and secrets! :-)"
2,could b a lot better......a lot,"tr3 isn't difficult..u get nowhere in this game for hrs at a time + that isn't challenging. TR + TR2 were just hard enuff this one is too frustrating. worst part is making jumps w/o knowing if you'll make em. just jump for it + hope u make it. if not let game take 5 minutes 2 reload where u just were + that's assuming u were able 2 save it where u just were. if not spend 30 mins getting back 2 where u were + then try the same jump again only 2 die again. reload again! game should let u save anywhere. the computer ones do, why should the lack of saves available dictate how difficult a game is? who wants to play FF8 all the way thru w/o saving, or saving only after u complete a CD? the GFX in tr3 are good. play control is ok. lara is still difficult 2 control at times. this game shouldn't be 5 stars or 4. it lost 1/2 star for the savegame nonsense + 1/2 star for play control."
4,Very durable,"We always have a problem with the paddle & ball toys, that is the ball always gets seperated from the paddle. My son loves that toy, but it ends up in the trash within days.THIS toy, however has stood the test of time. He got it for Christmas this year and still plays with it and the ball is still firmly attached to the main part of the toy."
5,Just what I expected.,Bought this for my husband. He watches TV and at the same time flips this in the air. Catches it nearly every time.
1,Doesn't last.,I used this punching ball for about 15 minutes per day for 9 days at which time it would no longer hold air. That comes to 2.25 hours before failure. I've written and my wife has written to the company. We were told they would get back to us in 2-3 business days. That time is now long past. Extremely dissatisfied with durability of this product.
4,4th edition,"This book has a lot of information, the cd backs up the information. It's very interesting you can live (pass) without the cd. But study hard"
2,Stickers are NOT as advertised.,"The stickers in the picture on the Amazon web site are NOT what you get sent. I bought the set for the cute Halloween sheets but they were not even included in the set I was sent.Here is what I got: 5 sheets of American flags, 5 sheets of plain red hearts, 5 sheets of red and purple hearts, 5 sheets of plain green shamrocks, 5 sheets of leprachauns, 5 sheets of Easter pictures, 5 sheets of fall pictures, 5 sheets of Thanksgiving pictures, and 8 sheets of Christmas teddy bears. Who wants 72 stickers of Christmas bears? If I had known what was really in this pack, I would not have bought it."
2,the genetic family history,this book is out of date and does not reference autoimmune diseases in relation to rheumatologic disorders such as lupus and leaves out any family genetics in hispanic disorders.
4,Found on road to Mt. Baldy,"I found the gloves by the side of the road. I am buying another pair as these are a bit too snug. Turns out I am always looking for a glove that isn't too bulky but has decent protection from the cold. Dexterity seems to be the priority here, but these should work well for the type of conditions that I usually recreate in. The neoprene seal around the wrist is notably well executed. I use them for skiing, snowboarding, and as gardening gloves. I think they would be ideal for cold weather cycling. Their is a snap on the wrist, as to attach to the jacket I guess."
2,Lutherans mistaking a mission statement as mission,"This book is a wonderful book which calls the church back to remember the power of the Biblical narrative found within worship--particularly in the sacraments. But unfortunately, it mistakes this proclamtion of hope as missional, even if the message remains within the walls of the worshiping space.My dictionary has 12 definitions for ""mission,"" everyone of them implies an action. This book rarely talks of Christian mission as an action. For these writers mission is simply the declaration of justice and hope God gives the world--which is taking place within a worshiping community. There is little sense of actually taking this mission statement out to the people who could benefit from it."
3,Not one of my favorite Metzger books.,"Well, it has all the Metzger elements that make for a fun read: cute animals, cute kids, a sweet romance, silly secondary characters, funny moments that can make you chuckle, good dialogue. Hey, some of the animals are even pigs. Who would have thought? A pair of cute twin girls and their pigs made for some funny moments.But still it's not one of my favorite Metzger Regencies. It was too full of silly stuff going on, almost trying too hard to entertain. Cutting down on some of the incidents in the book would have improved it for me. Although Metzger is known for her mayhem and madcap moments, some of her books get a little too carried away for me."
3,Read This Review,If you r a gavin degraw fan this is a pretty good but i would say it should be sold for a cheaper price. You could buy Chariot w/ Chariot Stripped and get 3 of those tracks on this CD. But the thing is that you get all of the album art and the music video.
2,CD music,"The CD arrived in like new shape and therewere no problems playing the music. Nothingwrong with the seller, would purchase from again.I found that beyond the hit song I did not enjoythis artist but this a personal preference and donot hold the seller responsible."
3,Trombone Bag,"Protec DELUXE TENOR TROMBONE BAG. This bag is okay for Non-Marching band gigs. I would not place it in a bus compartment or with other band instruments that can be tossed around. The bag has minimum protection and so great care needs to be taken when traveling. However, it is spacious inside and will accomodate most Tenor- Trombones with F-attachment."
3,Basic at best,"I was rather disappointed in this book. The tips are mostly quite basic (although a handy reference if you don't have a similar book) - store things where you use them, make the kids help clean up. I didn't feel that it lived up to its title of 'the organized *parent*' but was more of a general organizing book."
5,A parenting bible.,I should have read this book sooner!!!! From A to Z this book will help you budget your time better and be more efficient. Thus giving you more time for your family and yourself. The suggestions and tips are very helpful.A great reference book to keep on the shelf to pick up again and again.
5,Practical Help for Packrats,"As a single parent, I thought I knew every time saving organization trick in the book -- but not every one in THIS book! I found the segments on space organization (closets, bedrooms) particularly helpful, since I have limited space and tend to be a packrat. What I loved best about the book, though, is the non-judgemental tone. I half expected to feel guilty about all of the things I HAVEN'T done, but Tinglof's wit and style immediately put those fears to rest. Even better, the ability to choose between ""Major Tune-Ups"" and ""Quick Fixes"" allows me to tailor her suggestions to my own life and ever-changing circumstances. Bravo!"
4,TCDC52B on Canon S2 IS,Works extremely well. DOF you will never ever get on a large sensor. Only difference from wide open to F8 is DOF - sharp wide open. I shot bees from about 6 feet at 600mm equivalent. I get a 300mm to 600mm range without vignetting.The lenses did collide so only a 4 rating.Fixed with a filter with the glass removed for a spacer.The low price is for real. Buy two.Don't forget an adapter tube and a filter for a spacer.
3,"Nice laser, not so great of wireless mouse","Well constructed. Bright laser pointer. The wireless remote for moving PowerPoint and other presentations is very touchy. At times it will not advance to the next slide, at others it advances 2 slides for one click. Not very reliable for use as a wireless mouse when giving presentations or teaching ."
4,Contemporary art,"Ok, I do hope you're not anywhere close to seriousness when buying this video. That said, dude, its good. There's nothing like this. You get these 80s pinups in trashy bikinis shooting from ingrams to m16s and aks. They don't know how to shoot, of course. They get beaten by the weapons many times. The scenery and filming is completely f*c*ed up for todays standards, which only makes it better: you can see duct tape holding things together, and the ""models"" (ah-ha) struggle to seem to be enjoying themselves, giving you their best 80's gazes. The soundtrack....oh well.No wonder Tarantino and all others used it. It's four star simply because this is so bizarre that it disturbs me to think of it as perfect. But it is."
3,A blast from the past,"I used to own a copy of this on VHS back in the day; we nicknamed it ""Rambimbo.""Now it's available on DVD, and just in time for my birthday wishlist. Score!"
3,A Little Dated,"I would like to see Lenny update this video quite a bit. It has a very very 80's feel. The girls, outfits, hair, music, and videography are too dated. The concept, however, is pure gold. I would really enjoy a 2005 version with some modern day hotties. Maybe some belly shirts, pierced belly buttons, etc. Would also like to see some more variety. Maybe a tuner show type Asian babe, some Spanish blood and even some Ebony beauty would really make this a great new version. A goth chick would be interesting too. As Scott Ferrell would say ""shake it up"". Rock & Roll #3 is fun and interesting, I would just like to see a new edition. I'm sure Lenny could even get Uncle Ted to loan him some of his tunes and even that magic Nuge commentary. That sucker would sell a million copies.."
3,"Tall, loving and a Marine","The reviewer from Ontario, Canada has written the plot description. I liked this book, just not enough to give it more than 3 stars. One of the things that annoyed me was the sex they had in the beginning of the book. The premise is that Angela decides to have a 'one-night stand' with Dan because that's what he does. She gets so carried away with the sex that she ignores the use of a condom by asking him if he's healthy! This is a guy she just wants sex with because of his reputation for 'one-night stands' and she takes his word that he's healthy. Not believeable. That said, the rest of the story is OK and both Angela and Dan grow to realize that they can risk love for the joy it brings."
5,GREAT GAME FOR ANY WRESTLING FAN!!!,"WCW/nWo Revenge is the perfect wrestling game for even non-wrestling fans. The battle royal is the best, even if you get kocked over the top rope you still have a chance to back in the ring. The Sting and Goldberg entrances are awesome. Also fun about the game is the tag team title mode. Its easiness to control your person in tag team action is great. It also fun to play as th team of Harlem Heat (Stevie Ray, Booker T.). The only problem with the game is the handicap match which is very hard to defeat. But getting over that one hurdle the game is great."
4,COOL GAME/ GREAT FOR 4 PLAYERS,"I REALLY LIKE THIS GAME. IT'S FUN FOR ALL AGES, AND IT NEVER GETS OLD. IF YOU'RE A WRESTLING FAN, OR IF YOU'RE JUST LOOKING FOR A GREAT GAME, BUY WCW/nWo REVENGE."
2,i was realy disapointed with this game,"After wcw/nwo world tour I realy expected THQ to improve on their next game.However when I borrowed this game from a freind I discovered that it realy hasn't improved at all.All the moves are way to easy to perform[you just bash afew buttons and you can come up with a powerbomb or a piledriver]it doesn't take more than a brain-meltingly simple combo to get out a special[or finisher if you prefer]. Not only that but the graphics are realy chunky and badly detailed.When WARZONE looked so great you would expect them to spend a little more time making it visualy appealing . Its not atotal failure though,there are loads of characters and moves and its nice to beat up on Hollywood Hogan or Goldberg for once instead of Kane or Stone Cold. Apart from those few good points its still trash so if you realy want a wcw game I would wait for the promising looking WCW MAYHEM from EA instead."
1,Boy this game really really reeks of sweat and idiocy,"The music is cheesy. It sounds like punk rock in elvator music style.Giant stupid guys who say ""OOOOOOHHHH YEAHHHHH!"" and ""YAAHHHHHH"" every two mila-seconds. Bad wrestler names like Kidman, THQ Man, and Han Zo Mon.The controls are punch and grab. Thats it. 2d crowds who move their hands up and down are in the background. The best part is making the wrestlers look dumb in costume select mode. It's so pathedic it's funny. Melting butter by breathing on it is more fun than this..."
4,Possibly the greatest wrestling game of all time,"For an older title, this game is very good. The ring enterances are improved, the play control is very easy to master but still has a lot of surprises, there's a very cool Quest For the Best and Royal Rumble mode, a Spirit meter instead of a life meter, and tons of awesome wrestlers. The costume change mode is more in-depth than World Tour's, too.There are a few flaws, however. The graphics, although improved over World Tour, are still a bit blocky. The animation's kinda cheesy (although WAY better than the hyperfast or super slow Acclaim WWF games.) And if could have used more game options (all it has is Singles, Tag Team, Handicap, and Royal Rumble.)Overall, it's a good buy, especially if you have friends playing with you (as a multiplayer it eats Goldeneye's gun tag for lunch.) So far, it's my fave wrestling game, it's definately better than Warzone, Attitude, Nitro, and Mayhem. I'm hoping WWF2000 will top this one, though."
5,What a game!,"One of the worst things happening to me was when the WCW was destroyed. I never actually owned this game, but I practically rented it every day ! I don't remeber much of the game, but this game was sooooooo good! My favourite thing is that it has all the old classic wrestlers, for example: Disco Inferno, The Giant, Kevin Nash and my personal favorite is Mortis! The last thing you are doing buying this game is wasting your money. It is plus it's money's worth, a great game. Unfortunatelly, I only have XBOX and my Dad won't let me get an N64! I am soooooo annoyed that I can't play WCW games anymore."
5,Awesome Game,Great Game One Of The Best Of N64 Next To Paper Mario And Zelda OoT Ofcourse Anyway Buy It If You Have A N64 And Also Get wCw Nitro For PS1 Anyway BUY THIS AND NITRO AND THUNDER ALL FOR PS1
4,WCW/nWo Revenge,"Pretty good game, especially considering when it was made. One of the first wrestling games to have the grappling system used today. Not on No Mercy's level, but probably the best game WCW put out."
2,Will we ever get a good wrestling game?,"This game starts out with a good premise. You can win all the belts. Great. So, you go through and win the belts and themn the game is basically over unless you want to go through the monotony yet again. The choice of wrestlers is very good though. The battle royal mode is a disappointment. It takes forever to win but when you do nothing happens. Basically it says, ""You won."" What fun is that? Any gamer will win with any wrestler regardless of size. When will we see a game where the actual storylines and drama of wrestling come into play? I want to see a wresltling game get away from the arcade aspect and focus on the stuff that keeps us coming back week after week. Maybe one day the programmers will figure it out."
5,Super..,"Greatest wrestling game ever, to this day. Not only does it feature the best wrestlers from the greatest time period in all of wrestlings history, but that greatness translates into the game. Fun, and very real controll like features. Can't say enough how great the game is."
4,Pretty good!,My husband needed a new case for his sunglasses and this one has worked well. It does a good job of protecting his glasses especially as he was taking them in and out on our vacation to Florida. This case stands a good beating.
5,5ive are absolutely fantastic and they are HOT!!!!,five is absolutely brilliant. their cd is hot and so are they. they should definently keep making albums cuz they got it goin' on!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Battle Bummer,"I don't like this. It's just finding other people's ships. I mean, it's just like the game of memory!!! That game stinks. I don't like this. (Sorry if you like this game a lot)"
2,I don't think so,Battleship deserves 2 stars but only for the idea. It's so hard to learn how to even play the game. I don't own it but have tryed it and belive me it's not the ultimate classic.
5,Original is Best!,"One year we bought our son the electronic battleship game. This was a big mistake! It was very difficult to operate, so that the opponent could get on with their turn. Also the pieces kept falling apart. This is the same as the original battleship game which is great fun! Don't try these new electronic versions, as you will find it as disappointing as we did. This is the one you want, and it's great fun!"
4,Great game and solid fun!,"Unlike the new and ""improved"" version of the game, this version actually has fitting pieces that stay where you put them. The separate boards let players sit comfortably across the room unlike the new one-board version that forces players to huddle over a bizarre octagonal single board with pieces that fall out constantly.This is a great game for 6+ year olds and teaches strategy, coordinates, and some basic logic. Fun!"
4,one of the best games of all time,"you probably have played it or have seen the commercials at some point in your life if you are older than 20 at least. It is fun and can go most anywhere. Turn off your TV and open a board game, any board game and get your kids involved for some fun and surprise; some personal interaction too.. LOL"
2,Not Worth The Effort,"I bought this to play with my five year-old daughter. I tend to prefer games that can include more than two people, but I thought that this would be good for teaching some simple strategies. Unfortunately, the game is just too boring. While my daughter easily understood the game play, she and I both were done after just finding a couple of each others boats. It just takes too long and doesn't compete with the many entertainment options.As for construction, I will confirm other reviewer comments that the build quality is poor. I remember that in my old game, the pegs would sit firmly in the holes. Now, with a simple move of the board, pegs can fall down, causing you to lose your place. They also don't sit well in the boat pieces. I also received a number of crooked pieces, making them useless.I can't imagine how anyone wouldn't be disappointed by this game. You may get a few good rounds with it, but don't be surprised if it quickly ends up in the closet collecting dust."
4,Fun Battleship,We have never owned any other version of Battleship so this one seems fine to us. I like that all the parts fit into the cases for easy clean up & travel.
4,old school fun,"I bought this for my kids ages 9,8, and 7. The game is sturdy, and not too hard to understand. I love the pull apart consoles so they can take them pretty much anywhere to play so they don't get bored with it."
3,"Still a Fun Game , Current Version is Cheaply Made","Based on nostalgia for my own childhood, we got this for our soon-to-be 6 year-old for Christmas. I wasn't sure if my memory wasn't serving me properly or not, but other reviews here seem to confirm what I thought: the current version is very flimsy and cheaply-made compared to the older versions from years ago. The pegs easily fall out of their holes. The letters and numbers are hard to see as they are the same color as the board. That said, my son really enjoyed his first time playing, although he needed help from an adult navigating the grid. I do believe if the letters and numbers had better visibility he would grasp this sooner.I recommend finding an older version of this game on eBay or somewhere."
4,A great little logic test.,"This game is a classic and it really gets kids thinking about plotting the possibles and probables. They don't even realise it's educational as it's such fun. The design makes it a perfect travel game. A great one to get out when the chorus of ""are we there yet?"", is driving you crazy and playing ""eye spy"" is making everyone loose the will to live rapidly!I even get away with playing my knid of music without the children moaning or noticing!"
5,Battleship,"Most people say battleship isn't very educational. It is because it teaches kids how to use graphs, and it teaches them about war. It is a very fun game. I always loved battleship and I always will; It will never get old. Battleship lasts your life and stays fun all that time."
1,Warning -- I was sent the new cheap version of battleship,I order and spent the money for this classic battleship so that my husband would play happily with my son. We already have the new battleship which is cheaply made and is readily available at Target for $15. I spent $25 plus $10 shipping to get the classic version pictured. Well it came today and it was the new cheap version. I did not order this so I called the number for the company listed above. Strange that they don't take phone calls only emails. I will not pay for the Classic Battleship that I didn't receive. If Amazon can't work it out I will be filing a dispute with my credit card company and already talked to them about it. Anyway don't order this!!!
3,Battleship Tip,"Battleship is a really fun game if you think outside the box and hide your battleship on the carpet instead of on the board. However, this strategy carries a significant risk of physical violence from fellow game players(such as siblings) when they discover your ruse."
3,fun game,great toy for 8 years old. The battle over the sea make kids excited. But I expect more logic training from the game and I didn't find much.
4,Where are the ships?,Find the oppones ships on the grid and get a hit or miss. Try to find all five of your opponets ships before they find yours.
3,My new battleship game,"I have been wanting this game for a long time. I like the idea but my only problem is the game responses. It is hard to understand when a ship has been hit. You only can tell if it takes longer or says more words. What they say I have no idea but it isnt like You made a hit, or not. You can only play this game when no one else is speaking in the room."
3,"Fun Game, needs better design","I have to agree with several prior comments concerning the marking pins, they are a poor fit and a simple bump can cause the pins to jump off the board - can we expect a seven year old or even an adult to not bump the board ocasionally? Also, I had to file down the ships pins so they would fit into the boards holes - I don't recall having these problems when I was a kid. Too often the game companies rely on history to sell a game, then deliver an inferior produt."
4,Battleship - always a classic,"My 6 year old loves this game, of course he does it's battleship. Game is made more poorly than I recall...."
4,Perfect For Any Day! All Hands On Deck!,This was one of the most interesting & fun games of all times! We were known to play for hours when all the cousins got together for the holidays! We looked more forwrds to playing battleship than we did Grama's Christams Pudding! Of course if we could've kept up with the pieces Grama might not have taken our pudding away!
5,Still a great game!,"I used to play my much-older brother with my mom's old Battleship game (from 1971, still with most of the original packaging!). I even won some of the time, which was really nice because Older brother usually won everything! As was mentioned in the editorial review, the flaw of the pegboards' tendency to shift and lose their pegs is the only thing I ever found to dislike in any edition. The rules are simple enough for younger kids to learn, but older kids and adults can go more in-depth with strategies of hunting for and placing those little plastic boats. :)"
4,Ship...Sunk!,"Can you sink your opponent's ships? Battleship is easy and hard at the same time. The easy part is guessing where your opponent has placed their ships; all it requires is your voice! The hard part is figuring out a successful strategy that will win you the game...my strategy is to guess every other square, since none of the boats are only one square long. Keeping track of where you have guessed is fun, for some reason. Possibly because I enjoy being organized. The red and white pegs can easily be spilled or lost, so I recommend being careful when using them.Overall, this is a great game! I recommend it to people who enjoy fun board games that require good strategies."
1,Pegs fall out of the holes!,"My son and I enjoy playing Battleship - it's a great game. But I have to give this edition one star, for its fatal flaw: the pegs fall out of the holes very easily. This is mildly inconvenient if you want to suspend your game and resume later, because if you try to fold up the game board, you'll lose your pieces. But the pieces are so loose, they can fall out if someone just bumps into the table. One false move and you lose the whole game. I guess this is true of lots of games, like chess, but Battleship, with those pegs in a vertical surface, is a special case. There's no excuse for making pieces that are the wrong size."
1,This version is a piece of junk.,"Somehow when I decided to buy the more expensive version of this game, I expected higher quality and a better experience.This version that cost $70 including shipping, is a piece of junk. I looked at the $15 version over the weekend at a local store, and it is of much higher quality. This version is cheaply made and the pieces and pegs do not stay in the holes. What fun!Certainly the last time I will buy this type of item on Amazon."
4,Fun and educational,"My 6 year old enjoys playing this game, as did I when I was a kid. Heck, I enjoy it now. It's a good educational tool as well: it teaches the concept of a grid, spatial relationships, and strategy.One criticism: the pegs can fall out of the upper grids (used to track your ""shots"" at your opponent's ships) too easily. One decent thump and they can fall out in bunches. It is a good idea for each player to track the other player's misses in their lower grid so that when catastrophe happens, the pegs can be restored."
5,excellent,needed out door wire to run speakers to the front of the house(110'). The quality and insulation was great. great sound . I need more for the back............
1,Avoid,"One of Mal Spooner's other fund the Mavrix Growth Fund had the fourth worst 5 year return of all mutual funds in Canada ( as of Fall 2004 ) . It lost 28 % per year every year for the last five years . For every 1,000 dollars you had invested five years ago it would be worth 180 dollars today . Now he thinks he is a guru in rocks and oil . Incompetent , reckless gambler without a clue about investing period ."
4,Big Bird's Color Game,"Great book!!! My first copy has worn out from so much use!! I use this book in an educational setting. Useful for identifying colors, object use and functions, recognizing object characteristics. Very easy to expand upon with several age groups."
5,Read Over and Over,"There are just some books that a little one choses as their favorites, ""Big Bird's Color Game"" is definitely one of those in our household.In this book we have different pages with objects of different colors on them. On one page everything is red, on another page it is green. Big Bird describes something, and asks what is he thinking. The little one must guess. It is a good interactive book and one children enjoy guessing over and over again.Shirley Johnson"
1,Don't waste your Money,"You cannot patent something that occurs naturally in Nature. Therefore some people have bound an alcohol radical to a vitamin C molecule and patented it as Ester-C. It is my understanding that it is no better than naturally occuring Vitamin C, just more expensive. The alcohol burns off when absorbed. Notice they don't say it is better,just a new way to deliver Vitamin C. I'm sticking to the ""just-as-good"" rose hips version. Ask your medical doctor if you don't believe me.Gunner May,21007"
3,"Amazing Graphics, Boring gameplay",The weapons are awesome but the huge maps and boring objectives make this game extremely dull. Perfect Dark and Goldeneye all the way. Definately skip this game.
2,Turok 2: Lost in Caves,I guess that it had been a while since I had played Turok I and so I went out and got II. The graphics and action are very good but the downfall is that you have to keep backtracking into former levels (that I often don't remember from playing a couple of days ago) when you acquire a needed piece of the puzzle. This has caused me to quit the game out of tedium as I cannot unlock a level and have grown tired of back tracking to hidden areas for the needed keys. Mind you I say all this even with a gaming guide open on my lap as I play. So unless you are really dedicated/obsessive (I could see doing this when I was 15-18 years old) I can't advise wasting your time with more aggravation when you are just looking for a couple hours of escapist fare
2,Turok: Dino-Bore hunter,"I agree with everything in the review titled ""disappointing"". I haven't bothered to get to the end of the game. It's not worth it. The graphics are amazing; so what! The movement, control, and aiming are the worst I've encountered in in a 1st person shooter/rpg. The monsters are trite and boring; they were much better in the first Turok which was a far superior game to this commitee- designed mess. Acclaim went out of their way to give you more gore, splatter & agonized death throes. When you accomplish the annoyingly inane --but not mentally challenging-- tasks, you are left with the hollow sensation of having wasted alot of energy to accomplish absolutely nothing, and the frustration of loose control lingers. Don't waste your money; more importantly, don't waste your time on Turok 2."
3,same as #1.,"you run around,look for extremely hard to find switches and wander some more then well you know look for switches and well you then its ummmmm wander some more.then somewhere in the midst of all this maddening insanity,a cool monster will jump out and you get to waste his butt with a dynamite lased arrow.then its back to the wandering."
5,It is Horrible!!!!!!!!,"Turok 2 is one of the most tedious and boring games I have ever played. Not only are there no human enemies but all of them are really unrealistic enemies like huge human-dinosaur hybrids. I have to admit that the graphics are incredible for N64 but other than that and the realistic portion (you can blow enemy's heads, arms, and legs off with the more powerful weapons) The game offers levels that are to large and do not have enough save points. Another thing that bothers me is that you cannot use any of the good codes like all guns and unlimited ammo and invincibility."
5,Welcome to the War,"This game is very awesome. The graphics, the characters, the weapons, and the music are all top rate. Turok 2 probably has the best graphics of any other system or game out there. I have never seen anything like. The music also makes me think I am listening to some huge band playing. The first Turok was good but Turok 2 is 10 times better. Though this game is extremely gorey. And as a plus side from all of shootings that has been happening here, this game does not contain any humans beside your character to fight. All you fight is dinosaurs, dino-hybrids, monsters, and nasty spiders. This game is my favorite from all the games I played. Only Zelda is better."
3,The game doesn't compare to rare's goldeneye,Turok 2 by acclaim has one of the worst most boring one player games in the universe! The game although doesn't have such bad multiplayer mode. Although I feel goldeneye's is so much better... The only goose thing about the game is the frag tag mode where every body tries to get the monkey.
4,interesting,"Mia herself comes across as a bit quirky, but nothing worse. This is definitely a revenge book on Woody Allen... The pithiest line about Allen in the book is by Maureen Stapelton, ""He isn't shy. He's antisocial."" Allen does come across as possibly sociopathic. Franky, I'm a Beatles freak, and got the book just to read the chapter about Mia's experience meditating with the Beatles at the retreat in Rishikesh, India. She enjoyed their company, and that chapter was great fun to read, and I recommend reading it to any Beatles fan."
5,Not your typical working mother,"After reading ""What Falls Away"", a fascinating autobiography, I have the deepest respect for Ms. Farrow. She convinces me of her sincerity and integrity. Myself a mother of two who works outside the home, I grant Ms. Farrow the status of femme extraordinaire to have raised 14 chidren, some of them disabled, while succeeding as a stage and screen actress. I was disappointed that she conscientiously omitted any description of her sex life with Sinatra, Previn, and Allen. The saga of her fallout with Woody Allen literally gave me nightmares. The memoir's Appendix, which contains the final NY State Supreme Court ruling of Allen's child custody case against Farrow, is a triumph of the judicial system."
4,Review,"I had the privilege of going to school with Mia Farrow from 7th to 8th grade in Beverly Hills 90210 where she was precocious and keenly intelligent. Her book What Falls Away was poignant and brutally honest, and I applaud that effort. The work she has done with children and for children is monumental. I will always regret that I lost touch with her when the family moved to Spain."
5,A true survivor!,"There is not a lot to add to the reviews already given here. I really enjoyed reading this memoir of Mia's life, and look forward to how the rest of her life plays out. She was born into much more richness than many of us had, but her life shows that she was not immune to many disappointments: from the Polio she had as a child to the ultimate betrayal by Woody Allen. I was pleased to see how important her family was to her, and how important her children continue to be to her. What caused her more problems than anything was her poor choice in men, and in that failure she is certainly not alone. She is a true survivor as well as a woman with a very big heart. I read the book on vacation so quickly, I had to buy another book to read. And, then I even had time to read it again. Like it or not, Mia tells it as she sees it."
1,Too much bashing,"It's a beautifully written book, which reveals a lot about her past which is sad, and not revealed in such detail before. But the degree to which she bashes Woody Allen, including very personal details about his life, was excessive."
5,"This is the best Dub music, I have ever heard!","Cool!Try to translate the song called: ""Tekerd!""This is the real meaning of life!Great music, from the land of paprika, gulash, and telisalami!!!My favourite is ""még még még""... Its about sex, whoaaaa !!!! Enjoy it!"
4,Solid math textbook,"I'm a little torn on what to say about this book. On one hand, I have a huge amount of respect for this book. On the other hand, it's not an easy book to learn from.I have no doubt that if people work through this book, they will be very knowledgable and skilled in the areas covered. It is, however, a slow, tedious, sometimes frustrating process. The authors are clearly proficient at math, but their style is pretty dry. It's a ""just the facts, ma'am"" approach to instruction. It would be nice to have perspective, interpretation, and helpful guidance in addition to straight math. It's kind of like reading a technical manual. I prefer a more engaging presentation."
1,"For mathematicians, by mathmematicians","Frankly, I found this text way too brief in its coverage of topics prior to being bombarded with questions. There isn't much good to say about this book other than providing lots of problems to work. Save yourself the money and buy a ""10000 problem"" text instead."
5,Christmas Gift,Bought this for my son who just started his first corporate job. We are both Dilbert fans and he loved the gift. Beanbag was delivered on time and as described by vendor.
5,Must Read,"The ""On-Time, On-Target Manager"" has a pure, yet sophisticated simplicity that makes it a must read in a complex world. Very empowering!"
1,Not a well-focused book,"While the book touches on some interesting points about procrastination, it only skims over them. The points that it elaborates on are the very obvious and well-known ones to most people.This book is only good for those who lack basic common sense.The story it uses to get the points across to the reader starts out interesting and ends up being ridiculous."
4,Turn Your Kitchen Into a Lovenest,"What's sexier than a little kitchen romance? With the Erotic Magnetic Poetry set, every kitchen encounter can be amazing! With lots of fun words, you can create naughty messages your loved one will see every time - or as a little foreplay, you can create together what you can do later. If there aren't enough of a particular word or just can't find the right one - be creative - cut 'em up to mix and match so you have what you want! Happy playing..."
3,Quick shipping but food was very stale,"My dog loves this food, but for the (expensive) price, it should have been fresher. She's small, it was very hard for her to chew, I had to break it up for her. It's not usually this stale."
3,A Promising Future,"I lived in Yukon Oklahoma for a year and I actually got to know these guys. I was friends with their managerand partied with the band. I saw them on numerous occasions at clubs. The band, consisting of college students, has quite a good sound and song writing ability. My personal fave is Girth, with Pause to Pray and Moment of Silence in a close second. I recommend this CD to anyone who likes alternative music. Tey are not heavy enough to be considered metal, but give them time."
1,Way Too Obscure,"I am compelled to echo previous reviews for this game. In the market for a movie trivia game that did not require a DVD player, I found that the choice was limited to Movie Mania, which, I discovered, relies too heavily on generic quotations from relatively obscure films to be entertaining to a general audience. I am a film buff, as are most of my family, but we joke now that a perfect example of a question would be Q: ""Help!"" A: The Tommyknockers. Unless you want to bore your fellow players, save your money and move the DVD and TV into the game room."
1,Ha Ha Ripoff,This was not even 4 pages long. The information was not helpful to me. Don't spend any money on this. It is a ripoff.
3,Coleman Expandable Water Carrier,"Bought this for our trip to Philmont. Good, but not great product. Spigot leaks when holding water ... so water leaks out. Spigot also leaks in air when compressed ... so the carrier expands on its own ... and since it was being carried in a backpack, this was an issue."
4,Perfect,"Bought this to pack in my backpack (75L) for camp water on outings. Works great! Folds down to a nice size, pretty flat so i find it fits perfect either smashed down at the bottom (since I have a bottom access panel for quick getting-to) or up against the front smashed in front of my bivy and pad. 2.5 gallons is just enough for about a days worth of water (2 dehydrated meals, coffee, tea, and drinking water), or one rinse bath (cold though). The valve is the only reason it got 4 stars rather than 5 - it's pretty cheap plastic and could crack off if you drop your pack or smash it too tightly. Overall though, it works perfectly and is great for my backpacking trips."
3,Sounds made up,"It sounds like she took all of her experiences and applied her snotty yet endearing attitude in retrospect and ""spiced up"" what really happened. It is amazing that so many people didn't think she could be a model. She's pretty- but why does she think she was the first ""super model?"" She was not."
1,spoiled,1 word for this book SPOILED...She just spoiled the image behind the face.Miss Janice: you should'nt be so ugly to those girls on top model. I really thought you were cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,"Most egotistical ,self-absorbed, shallow piffle ever!","Good night, but this woman is madly in love with herself!! In nearly every photo caption she proclaims how fabulous she thinks herself. But I found this book to be ultimately rather sad. It's written by someone who spent their entire life thinking that all that matters is the outer shell. And apparently surrounded by people who think the same. Pathetic, sick, sad, horrifying ...perfliction indeed."
4,"Everything about her is fake, she's a bitch, and it makes for fantastic reading!","Janice is on top of the world in this book, and she might come off too-bitchily over the top for readers who haven't read her first memoir, No Lifeguard on Duty. In her first book, she reveals a lot of childhood abuse, personal pain, addiction, and turmoil during her super-life. For fans of that book, Everything About Me is Fake is wonderful because it shows Janice back in the game, on top of the world, and it is one heck of a read.In short, this is a love-it or hate-it book. I loved it and found it bitingly funny, life-affirming, bitch-affirming, woman-affirming, deliciously decadent, and wonderfully revealing. Janice cracked me up while coming off as very ""real"" (not fake in any way). Highly recommended to people who like to read about the larger-than-life lives of interesting people."
3,Some parts okay.,I was a fan of JD...you could certainly hear her in this book. Some points were interesting others were loud. I needed a break many times for her voice bc it was too much in one sitting. Good book that's completely opposite from most of our current lifestyles.
2,not so good...,The book was choppy. It didn't flow nicely like No Lifeguard on Duty (which I loved). It just felt somewhat disconnected. I'm a bit discouraged to buy the last book from her. I can't belive the difference between the first one and this one! And it cost too much!!
3,Everything about her....,"is purely fake but it was a cute read to read when there is nothing else to do! There is a lot of fowl language so if you are offended by that, it's not for you. And be warned that it's a lot of talking trash about certain people!"
3,Get that Spotlight over here!!!,"I read and loved Janice's first book. A sassy model with a unique perspective on life, it made for interesting reading. But she has nothing new to say here. So she rambles. And brags. And drops names. But she does add a few beauty secrets and coming from someone who should know, those should be taken to heart.But in the end it's a book of nothing. It appears she made money on her first book and now wanted to revisit the ATM machine. But you've got to offer a compelling story. The first one is. This one isn't. I'd take a pass on this one. It is a short read so if you decide to buy this, your time investment won't be too bad. And another positive is it is so lightly written, you can almost multi-task while you're reading the book."
5,"One hot read abot a ""hot"" chick.","I am a fan of Americas Next Top Model, and I enjoy how Janice Dickinson puts down the girls. When I heard she had a new book coming out, I looked forward to reading it for weeks.Wow. This woman had a life! ""Everything About Me is Fake, and I'm Perfect"" is awesome. Janice was a very beautiful women, and I couldn't believe the stories I read in this book. I laughed and cried through the whole book.This book is ten times better than her firstbook, ""No lifeguard on duty. I read it in one night. I just couldn't put it down."
4,Great story to read,"Janice's self proclaimed ""supermodel"" title has always been in question by people in the business for years. Because of that rumours spread to not take her seriously and that everything that comes out of her mouth is garbage. Wether or not whats said about her is true, the book is wonderful. A great story to read if you want to know what models really do to look the way they do. But a warning, sometimes Janices arrogance can drive you over the edge"
1,Is she for real?,"I liked the first book, it was an interesting look into her life. This is just a narcasistic account of an aging model who really has not done much with her life. She is addicted to plastic surgery now and not drugs anymore --good for her. After reading this book with its dropped names, erroneous dateline and focus on her makes me wonder if she truly got of drugs or if this book is an after effect. It was boring and really a waste of time."
5,Come on :),Janice Dickenson doesn't hold back and what else wold you want from a biography?Great candid read and I appreciate the honesty...say what you want about Janice...this is an honest story!
4,It's hard to beat whiteside router bits,These bits came in chip free and function great. After a year of use they appear to have a longer life than cheaper bits.
5,EXCELLANT BITS,These are not your harbor freight bits. These are 100 percent American carbide steel made in America to exacting standards. I tried one out on some purple heart and it cut through like hot knife through butter.
5,Rogue Squadron RULES!,"Rogue Squadron is one of the best games I`ve played in a while. The graphics, sound, and all of the action makes you feel like you are right in the movie. It has all of the ships that were in the first three movies and there are codes to get other ships. All of the levels are full of action and you never put the controller down once you have started playing. You can play Rogue Squadron a million times and it will still be fun. That is why I think it is one of the best games I've played."
5,The best Star Wars game yet!,"This game is ace. From the moment you blow the first Probe droid to smithereens to the second you blow the last enemy to bits this game enthralls you. The missions are great, although at first some seem boring, when you get to about mission five it gets a lot tougher and better. You get to fly five craft, X-Wing, Y-Wing, A-Wing, V-Wing plus a Snowspeeder which you can take AT-AT's down using the tow cable like in Shadows Of The Empire. There is hundreds of enemies ranging from Probe Droids to Cloud Cars to AT-ATs. Something that isn't in the first three films is the AT-PT, All Terrain-Personel Transport, which are tougher than the AT-st's but not half as hard as the tough as nails AT-AT's. From start to finish this game is great, and the medal system lenthens the game a massive lot, you have to replay the missions to get Gold medal on all levels to access secrets like the Millinium Falcon, T-16 Skyhoppers plus Battle of Hoth mission. This is a great game."
5,Rouge Squadron,"What a great game! It has great graphics, action, and color. If you are a piloting game fan this is a must. There are five ships all with many cool weapons. This game also has many levels so it will take you a long time to beat. This game has the characteristics of a winner. BUY IT!"
5,"Date 2006, to this date MY FAVORITE GAME EVER!!!","I have got to be honest even if it means sacking my reputation. I have never played a game so much before in my life. I only own the N64 still for this game, I have thrown out all others. This game brings such a Movie like experience along with great missions, craft, and imperial action that I have never seen anything to its likeness. You have got to get this game under all circumstances if you are a Star Wars fan."
5,You don't have to be a hardcore starwars fan to like R.S.,A fast high pase flight sim. With a viarty of vicleals to chose from. If you like starwars you will love rogue Squadon. If you dont like starwars you will still like it.
5,Rogue Squadron is an Excellent Game!,"Rogue Squadron is one of the funnest games that I own for my Nintendo 64. It is exciting to pilot all of your favorite Star Wars starfighters. And yes, you can bring down a walker flying clockwise, which the ""cons"" sections says you cant. just use your right airbrakes. And against another thing in the ""cons"" section, even though its not the real voices, the voices of Luke Han and others sounds pretty convincing. If you are a Great Star Wars fan, you should buy this game. It has excellent graphics, even without the 4MB Expansion Pak, and its easy to catch on to. The storyline is also authentic. The gameplay is great."
4,I want a space battle!,All the missions are land missions and they get boring after awhile. This a good game to play when your bored. It's one of my favorites. Not close to Colony Wars though. If you like Star Wars buy this. It is a good space battle game. It would be nice if a battle took place in space though. I give RS *Bulls-eyes four womp rats* four stars.
5,Rogue Squadron: A good flight and fight simulator.,"Star Wars: Rogue Squadron is a fun gaming experience. Flying some of the best known fighter craft in the history of the movies is enticing enough, but for the true gamer, it is a challenge to master. My only comlapints are that there are no space battles and no multi-player options. Asside from that, it is a rock solid game."
4,Good buy...,My sons are forever looking for deals on video games for all systems. Amazon is their favorite place to look. They received this game and have no complaints.
5,"Fantastic, Wonderful, Star Wars Done Right","You have to understand that for me, the same as for probably scores of other kids and kids at heart, there was just about nothing closer to my heart or more thrilling to my imagination than the prospect of being a starfighter pilot in the Star Wars universe. Which is to say that there could not have been a game that excited me more, simply by the prospect of its subject matter. The amazing thing about Rogue Squadron was how good it was. Gameplay, graphics. It was not just a subpar product with a Star Wars sticker on it (there have been plenty of those, in the videogame sphere and beyond); it was a well-designed, terrific, replayable game in its own right. So for me, it was a brilliantly enjoyable gaming experience. I have been using past-tense verbs, because I sold all of my N64 gear years back, but for anyone looking for a good N64 game or a first-class Star Wars experince in particular, Rogue Squadron *is* a very fine choice."
5,Rogue Squadron is the best Star Wars game for the N64,"Rogue Squadron. Every Star Wars fan knows the elite starfighter group of pilots. Now you get the opportunity to experience what it feels like to hop into the cockpit of an X-Wing,Y-Wing,A-Wing, V-Wing, Millenium Falcon, T.I.E. Interceptor, and the Naboo Starfighter. As you fly through over 15 missions, ranging from Tatooine to Mon Calamari, you'll earn ranks in the squardron<the highest I've gotten is Gold Leader>. With each mission you complete, you'll earn a medal<bronze, silver or gold>and be promoted. Do you have what it takes to buy this game, and prove you've got what it takes to be a top fighter pilot?"
3,Way Too Easy,When I first got this game I loved it.But after two weeks I had beat the game and had golds on most of the levels.It felt really weird flying an X-wing over land.It was like flying a car around in the air(witch you can actually do with a code).But I have to admit the ships are great and with the expansion pak the graphics could not be better.A must have for Star Wars fans.
4,N64 to the limit!,"An exiciting, fresh, and all the rage game. The best Iv'e seen yet! Graphics for this game are superb. Sound, also plays a part in RG. They actually talk in this one! Passcodes, biographies for the pilots, and special FX work hand and hand to make this awesome. Also, good freedom of your ship make this one fun and hard game. Fly as Luke Skywalker over Tatooine, Imperial terrortory, and much more. Each mission is jam packed with Imperial scum. And with five space crafts( not counting the secret ones), I defintely reccomend it."
4,The force is with this game.,"Trust your gaming feelings. If you are a fan of the trilogy, then you will want this game."
3,Finally a not too easy game,"Not too easy because those, more experienced in the video game world, need more challenge and this one definitly brings it to you. Missions to make you learn how the real thing would be like and rewards to keep you wanting more. Certainly non-repeating this game brings a lot of excitement and the cheat codes give you even more portions of the game, once uncovered they renew this game for much more fun. So if you want to experience the Star Wars universe this is the one baby."
2,Not that loyal to the movie,"Rogue squadon is somewhat fun to play but the majority of the missions are hard to beat. the 3D enviroment is cool looking and on some levels there are places you can see that are straight out of the movie such as Jabba the hutt's palace on Tattoine.The main problem i have with this game is on the Hoth and Deathstar mission.(use password DEADDACK to get to them)on the Hoth mission you wrap a cord around Imperial walkers to trip them which is tricky to do. As for the Deathstar mission, the scenery is wrong. In the movie Luke fires at the exhaust port at the end of the trench, in the game the target is on the ground. But that's not what bothers me most though, After you hit your target it just says ""Mission Complete"" They should've had a cinematic sequence where the Deathstar blows up. That doesn't happen in the game which leaves you feeling angry and unsatisfied."
4,A Must-Have for Starwars fans.,"If you are a true Star Wars Fan, then you must have this game. The story line is real good, and it actually gives you plenty of information from the movies. The special effects and graphic detail (with the expansion pak) are real good.I think that two of the major cons are that 1)the game does not have a multiplayer mode and 2)I really expected more from the ""Death Star Trench"" level. The truth is that that level has NOTHING to do with the Death Star trench run. Rebel Assault's level is much better."
4,no time to read,"i will read this later when i have some time, it looks very interesting, and i cannot imagine that it is not!"
1,One of the worst books I've ever read,"Full of awkward stereotypes, what could be a decent chick lit book is marred by poor writing ridiculous & silly characters . There's some real emotional content there but it's buried inside inanities. This book actually made me angry."
3,so-so,not the best book I've read but not the worst. if the book wasn't free i might of liked it less. The hero wasn't really fleshed out a whole lot and somehow we are supposed to like him by the end without really knowing him.
2,Easy and entertaining.,Easy read and fun. The story depends on the foolishness of the characters and is not a well woven tale but it was entertaining.
3,Cute book,A great book to pass the time....the ending was surprising but was very sweet... and a quick read with memorable quotes...
3,Not bad at all.,"Yes the climax quite literally ""theatrical"", but I liked the parts where there is a reflection of how real friends are. Mona and ""Groana"" are both people I can relate to in some of these parts :) Am willing to read another book from this author."
5,Need an escape ? This books' for you !,"Loved this book...read it in a matter of days, as I couldn't put it down. Coburn develops Mona and the other characters very well - there is a side of Mona that probably everyone can relate to...I found myself just busting up laughing amongst Mona's antics..especially when she stuffs her bra with ""temporary"" breast implants. They fall out of her shirt, onto the desk of her future husband...Her response is that they're ice packs and she has a breast infection ! It is hilarious. There are some sad moments to the book as well, in relation to Mona's family history and the tragedy she went thru' as a child. I dont' want to give it all away. Bottom line: Buy this book. It's touching in parts and also very funny ... I highly recommend it."
2,Reinventing boring,"I am one of few who did not like this book. It certainly was not the worst book I have read and I breezed through it in a couple of days, but there were parts that were so entirely unreasonable I just wanted it to be over. I know its fiction, but it wasn't believable fiction. Plus the conclusion was a joke, and not a laughing with you joke, rather a laughing at you joke. To her Credit, Coburn made the other characters very likeable. Coburn has great potential, I just felt that she was pushing her charcter in a direction that no real person would go. Though she was REinventing Mona, so maybe I just didn't get it."
5,Still Smiling,I read this book about two weeks ago. It is a hoot. I've smiled. I've laughed. I've been shocked. Overall a great book to read.
2,Long winded but cute,"This book should have been much shorter, I'm not sure why the author dragged it out so much. It's about a girl who wants to discover herself in order to the guy but there are all these other stories twisted in, it becomes a odd soap opera of people."
3,It was good....,I liked the story line...however there was WAY to much detail in this book. I mean it would be going good in today's time then bam next chapter it was about her childhood...sometimes I thought it was frustrating so I would just skip over it. I like to know a little about the past just not ever second of it. However I wish they would have put more into the relationship of the dog and Mona. I would have liked to know kind of what was going on they his mind from time to time besides his little rants...it made it difficult to realize that they could be more than friend. Other than that it was good and not a complete waste of my time so that's a plus.Always a Romantic xoxo
3,Really cute,"I was with this book up until the very end, it was over so abruptly, I was was like WTF??? The book was so funny and witty throughout and then the part after the theater when everyone professes their love for Mona was great, and then BAM...over..preggers...family. Great book, terrible ending!"
1,The worst book!,This is without a doubt the most awful book that I have ever read. The story idea was cute and could have made a fantastic book...but this book was just horrible. I have no idea how it can be considered a romance novel. There is not one ounce of romance in the entire book. There is no way that a reader would think that Mike and Mona have fallen in love by the end of the book...and speaking of the ending it was a completely ridiculous and unrealistic ending and frankly it wasn't even funny. I don't usually write reviews and I usually give ever book I read atleast 3 or 4 stars even if it was just okay...if I could have given this book less than 1 star I would have. Please don't waste your time!
4,"Fun, fresh... chick flick","It was a fun story, good timing, funny allusions to the whole man's world, woman's world differences. I would recommend it to my friends, is the kind of story that you can watch in a movie with popcorn!"
4,Fun,"Fun, quick read. Yes, it's predictable, but it was an enjoyable read. I actually couldn't put it down & was bummed when it ended."
3,great potential,"So, I don't intend to make this a negative review, more of a neutral one. I felt after reading this, like it would have been a really good book if it had been less of an outline and more of a novel. Throughout reading this book I felt it was a case of the author telling the reader everything instead of showing them. You can tell someone about an exciting subject all day long, but it will never be the same as experiencing it for yourself.I thought the concept was good here, but I never really thought it lived up to the potential it had. I would have felt a lot closer to the main character if the author had given her more dimension. I didn't hate this book, but it wasn't the great book I thought it could have been."
2,Disappointing,"I thought the book would be a fun, relaxing read. It was simply ok. Nothing more. A predictable, mediocre story with a strong need fora better editor and proofreader. (The typos kind of drove me nuts.)"
2,Disappointed,The story. Began nicely although a little too cute. I was really disappointed with the rapid ending. As the writer got bored.
4,Another great book by Jennifer Coburn,"I loved Wife of Reilly and it's original story. While Reinventing Mona isn't as original, it's another book that has you turning pages and hoping it doesn't end. Reading about self-described ""boring"" characters like Mona can be boring, but not here. Mona is funny with a great voice, and I loved her friend Greta. I think Jennifer Coburn writes books that everyone can enjoy because her characters, while not perfect, are just so darn fun to read about. I'm already looking forward to her next book."
1,The WORST,"I cant say that I wasn't disappointed with this book. I had high hopes for Mona, but this book was so dull I wanted to cry. I try my hardest to make it to the end, and unbelievably I did. The ending was laughable, and not in a good way. One of the WORST I have ever read."
4,Cute and fun!,A quick read. Different types of love coming together in a sweet story! Very enjoyable and entertaining with a silly twist.
5,A good read,"Good girl with a tragic past dares to take risks. Mona and her new friends are quite the odd assortment but it works.It was funny and touching at the same time. The lesson is , help someone and good karma will come your way. I loved this book."
3,Wild sided!,"Defiantly didn't see something's coming in this book. I think my mouth fell open and I snorted when I laughed too. The only thing I would have liked less of was the look backs of her past . I thought they were too lengthy , and I would have loved to have seen more details on the relationships that grew at the end of the book. I really enjoyed the wicked sense of humor of the characters ."
4,Funny,I liked this book. Mona is likable and the story kept me engaged. I will look for more books by this author.
3,interesting,"still reading it, but hard to keep me fully interested at all times, but something nice to enjoy during downtime"
4,Fun book,This was an amusing read and I really laughed out loud at the ending. A light holiday read or when you are sick in bed.
4,Good read,Reminds me of the movie with Katherine Neill. But still a good read. Wrapped up a little quickly at the end.
4,Funny and keeps you guessing,"Great book. After reading one of her books, I immediately downloaded her others. This book has a refreshing storyline, but also the comedic romance that you're looking for. A relaxing read that kept me engaged - something that is important!"
4,Reinventing Mona,This was a good read! A little slow to start but easy to continue reading. Even better that it was free!
2,Reinventing Mona,"Good story line, but fails to deliver. Characters are not fully developed, and readers are often ""told"" what happens or how a character feels rather than ""shown."""
4,Reinventing Mona,Would recommend this book for a light read. Sometimes it is a little over the top and unrealistic.but the ending is just great
3,Good Story,"Poor Mona has been through a lot in her life. She was raised on a commune and lost it all in an instant when the bus-load of family died in a bus accident. From that day on Mona was sent to live with her Grandma in San Diego, where life was quite different for her.Now her life consisted of maids and private school and a complete lack of self-confidence. A year after her grandma passes away, Mona decides she's chosen her future husband, Adam, and all she had to do was reform herself into exactly who he would want to marry. It turns out she find herself along the way and really doesn't need Adam or his uptight ways and perfect, storybook family to make her happy.This is a cute and funny story that points out that all you have to do to be happy is be yourself and have the people you love around you!"
2,"I gave 2 stars for the first half, and zero star for the rest.",The idea of the book could have made a fantastic story. But it wasn't. The beginning of the book was good but the ending was the worst part of this book. I just hate it. It was ridiculous. It wasn't at all worth my money.
2,Dull and flat,I'm 58% done and so bored that I just can't finish. It has gone from interesting to silly to boooriiing. The author continually inserts herself by explaining and over describing. This makes it so hard to lose yourself in the story. I should know by now not to listen to gushing fans who give everything 5 stars. At least it was relatively inexpensive.
3,REinventing Mona,"The author kept telling about things that happened in the story in the past tense, without ever letting the reader be in on the moment.Also, there was no sex."
4,Reinventing,"Great story,lots of laughs. Kept going until the end. Mona wasn't all that bad for a nut case .recommended reading."
4,Cute!,"I like this book! It had some laugh out loud parts, however, it was a little predictable, but I really enjoyed the characters. The most disappointing thing that I noticed was that the story line was much too like the movie ""The Ugly Truth"" with Gerard Butler and Katherine Heigl. Still a cute story, though."
5,this is a great show,I bought this for my mother and watched it to see if it worked I love this show still looking for season 3 and 4
5,Awesome Series!,Great show! Great price! One of the best series every made! Buy it today! You will not regret it!
5,Early Edition - Season 1 and Season 2,"I sure wish I could get the entire series, but it is not released yet. CAUTION - Do not order the series from other sources, I did, and found out the hard way that they are recorded right off the TV. Terrible picture, out of order and clips of commercials. It will be worth the wait to get it directly from the source when it is released."
4,"Early Edition, Finally on DVD","When these come out, I can finally do away with all the VHS tapes that I recorded the series on back when it was in cable reruns.It was on the worst night of the week on CBS, but it set the standard for this type of time manipulation show. It had all the great episodes - like when the cat ran away and led Gary to his predecessor's dying girlfriend. Or the girl who could see the future, and then saw Gary come in and change it.The show lost something when Fisher Stevens left, and was replaced by Kristy Swanson, but it was finding itself again in the final season.I look forward to collecting these long awaited DVD season box sets."
5,One Great TV Show of the 90's But Why the Stop?,THis is one of the great TV shows of the 90's. Better then most of the trash on now. Season one and two are out. Great I have them. And love the show. Now why the stop? It has been like a year now. Where is season three at?Please CBS. Get with it... Give us the rest of it.... Got it?Still looking for seasons 3-4 and 5.. ??????
3,Different,"Not what I expected but interesting. I was hoping for more of a story but this gave a very good insight as to what was going on to the lesser characters who were involved in the battle. Some though I had heard a lot about, Lee, Bullregard, so I didn't hear anything I hadn't heard before. It was still educational and entertaining. I wish more people knew what others had gone through and sacrificed to provide them the liberties and freedoms they are so casually throwing away today."
5,Civil War DVD,"Being an avid Civil War person for many years, this DVD was excellent due to the fact that many short stories (many different battles went on during the Gettysburg campaign) I did not know nor ever heard about. I could study the Civil War for the rest of my life and not know it all!!!I would strongly recommend this DVD to anyone that is a Civil War person that wants to know more about Gettysburg."
5,Another way to Jenga!,1. Tape as many Jenga sticks together with masking tape on one side to support a favorite picture that you would like to turn into a special puzzle.2. Have your child find a any picture they would like to turn into a puzzle (even a favorite photo can work.)3. Glue whole picture to opposite side of masked taped Jenga.4. Shellac and allow to dry5. Use excto knife and cut the picture apart.6. Remove tape and voila`--your own hand-made puzzle!Even toddlers can put a 5 piece puzzle of an animal or fruit together and they love creating their own puzzle! Enjoy! Aloha!
4,"Fun on its own, but better when combined with other games","I played this game a few times over the years, and it's fun, but not exactly something I felt compelled to own.Many years later, I came across Jenga again, but this time it was combined with a horror/suspense role-playing game. If you like playing RPGs, but don't like being held down by stats, die rolls, and rules, I'd suggest checking out the Dread RPG by Impossible Dream (tiltingatwindmills.net).Whereas in other horror and suspense RPGs, you can say ""my character is feeling scared"", in Dread, you can look at the swaying tower and feel as scared as your character is.Now a Jenga game is a ""must-have"" in my game closet!"
