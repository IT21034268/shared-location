5,good,"this cd is awesome. tho i wont say its an improvement from wiretap, they do experiment a little. tracks 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8-10, and 14 are all good tracks IMO. but the stand outs are tensioning and while oceana sleeps."
1,They could learn from Mars Volta,"Okay....with the break up of ATDI, It is pretty obvious that all the talent went to The Mars Volta. These guys don't suck. They are just boring. They sound like every other band I have heard before that is out there making music with no uniqueness really. People think just because they can play an instrument that they can get a deal and start a band. This is what Sparta did just like all the other 500 bands in the industry who all sound exactly alike. The MArs Volta has tried new things and these new things have separated them from the 500 other bands. Like Tool, Led Zepplin, Pink Floyd, And Queen...Mars Volta tried something different, which has gained them a great amount of respect. Sparta? I can name a million other bands similar."
2,Mars Volta VS Sparta,"Mars Volta wins.I could leave the review at that one line but to put it another way, 15 years from now almost no one will remember Sparta and Mars Volta will still be considered a seminal band."
2,Wha?,"I don't get this CD. I listened to it, listened to it again, chased my cat, cheeseyfranks, with a Salisbury steak TV dinner, listened to it again and nope, nothing. It's more average rock by bands that Mark Knopfler should put over his knee and whoop with a copy of Procol Harum's Las Vegas comeback effort. It's junk. Kroll was all about Sparta about 6 months ago before a telemarketer talked him into some psychic network. He now tells me that my oatmeal may jump up and start singing showtunes if my aura is not in line. Anyway, Sparta is a waste of time only Saved by the Bell, the pre school years, can compete with."
3,Cut that City,Sparta's Porcelain and Wiretap Scars is nothing compared to The Mars Volta's Frances The Mute and Deloused in the Comatorium also Tremulant Ep. Um how can anyone say that Sparta's albums arer better when The Mars Volta puts most excellent bands to shame.
5,Best Werewolf book Yet!!!,Being a avid werewolf fan I also bought this book cause of the cool cover. Gary does an excellent job making you care deeply for the the main Characters (Kyna and Cyrus). I did not want to finish the book and just wanted it to keep going and never end. I have searched for another book that would stand up to this one as far as the werewolf part and romance. I have not found one yet.
5,1939 Story of Diego Rivera's Life and Work,"Bertram Wolfe's original 1939 story of Diego Rivera's life and times. The book contains many great photos of his murals, both wide shots and close-ups.

The book contains 420 pages.I hope this helps in your decision to purchase this very detail, wonderful out-of-print book."
1,Cheap Plastic Design - Breaks Easily,"I have flowen model rockets for over 40 years now, and the parachutes that Estes is making currently are an embarassment to the company! They are made of cheap plastic instead of nylon. The plastic often tears away from the cloth cords, and the cords tangle easily. Added to these problems, the chute often does not fully deploy if the plastic chute is not powdered to make it less ""sticky"". And forget about launching in cold temperatures as the plastic has a ""memory"" and often fails to open in cold weather.Estes plastic parachutes, no matter what size, are a disaster to be avoided. Pay la little more money for a nylon parachute and it will last as long as the rocket.Jim Konedog Koenig"
2,Not worth it,"A lot of work clearly went into this book, but not a lot of information. If you're looking for info, some of the web references are the wrong addresses, the book is about 220 pages (double spaced) with about 100 pages that are reprints of ""checklists"" - i.e., does your child prefer to be warm or cool when studying? There are references to other people's work (admittedly there's not a lot out there) but it seems only anecdotal original work, most of which is repeated numerous times and is generally the same girl identical twins. For those of you out there looking for answers, they're not in this book."
1,Unreliable,"Be careful when ordering this product. I do not know the quality of this item because I never got it. I've waited over a month to receive it but I never did. Amazon had to cancel the purchase. Beware when you order this item that it might come late, if it comes at all."
2,Memory Pak Failed on me ..,"At first impression, I loved the HyperPak ... however - after about a week's worth of using, the memory side of the pak became corrupted and crashed on me - and the rumble side sometimes goes off on its own tangent and does whatever it wants to.The rumble, however, is still operational and a great feature - the 2x rumble really makes games come alive ..."
1,Poor Quality Product and Poor Service!,"The poster arrived quickly, but it was very poor quality. It was blurry and was obviously a photo of the real thing that was then blown up on a copy machine. I emailed the supplier multiple times with no response. I called and was given instructions on how to return the poster. Sent it back, but no credit to my account or acknowledgement. I finally gave up, which is what they probably expected. Won't do service with this supplier again."
1,Just for Collectors,"This DVD should be labeled as ""Collector's Edition"". It's the first recorded by Bill Gaither and it's completely different that Homecoming as we know today. Video and audio quality is poor. It's just a group of friends singing around a piano. There are times when mic cable is in front of camera!"
5,Beautiful,"I have 4 kids 2 with a disability and this song melts my heart everytime I hear it and gives me so much hope.I really cry everytime I listen to it.When you believe,miracles do come true."
3,Symbiotropin,"I'll have to agree with E. Winkeldude. There were quite a few tabs in my box that were either spoiled brown or rotten black goo. As far as effectiveness in muscle grouth, I don't think I saw anything (but I only did one cycle). The taste was okay but you need nearly frozen water to drink it. I could say between this and some other things I was taking at the same time, I slept all right and my muscles felt well rested for the most part (even after hitting the gym every day). However, I won't buy it again. It's way too expensive to get the little result that I got."
2,Product may be spoiled...hit or miss.,"I had no issues with my initial order. The first box was 100% useable, so I went ahead and ordered two more. What a waste! Second box had 4 bad tablets...ok, not so good but I overlooked it. Last box: about one out of three effervescent tablets were spoiled, and by spoiled, I mean there was either a brown smelly and badly decomposed tablet or some nasty rotten black goo in each of the packets. I can't speak to the effectiveness of this product yet, but I was hoping that it would at least be useable! Bad batch perhaps, but TWO boxes!? Unfortunately, I missed the product return deadline by less than two weeks because I didn't discover the bad tablets in time."
3,Not sure if this worked,"I took this product as directed and didn't see any significant gain in energy, muscle or strength so not sure what this product does for the price they charge."
4,Lots of information,"I had been looking for a book like this one for a long time and this one fills the bill. However, you're going to need a magnifying glass to read it- the print is REALLY small. I guess they had to use a small font to keep the book a reasonable size, but it induces more than a little eyestrain if you read it for more than a few minutes at a time."
3,Miss Loleatta,"Here is the Philly sound paired with Loleatta's distinctive, gospel stylings. The disc includes 3 blues ballads and 5 danceable, soulful tunes. A bonus 12"" version of ""Hit and Run"" is included. While not as smooth as Gamble-Huff productions like Harold Melvin's ""Bad Luck,"" O'Jay's ""I Love Music,"" Jean Carn's ""Was That All It Was,"" Thelma Houston's ""Don't Leave Me This Way"" or Lou Rawls' ""You'll Never Find,"" nor as dance-fuelled as other Salsoul numbers like Inner Life's ""Moment of My Life,"" First Choice's ""Let Me Down Easy,"" or Holloway's ""Catch Me On The Rebound,"" this album contains a nice selection of disco."
3,"Very good quality, received fast !","Good quality, received quickly. It was hard to find in stores, so thatwas a great find!!"
1,Not bad except ?,I was dissapointed to find that In Hell was not on any of the disc.I thought I was getting three movies but dont know what happened?
2,Unimpressive and unhelpful,"I purchased this book to help me with ideas for homeschooling my children. This book is the longest in my collection but it is the least informative. The first 100 pages or so deride the current efforts of public schools, yet offer little advice except ""turn off the television"" and ""read to your children"". The most interesting and helpful information in the book was taken directly from the Core Curriculum Series, which is a useful resource for parents who want to ensure that their child is receiving a good education. This book is preachy and redundant."
4,Good Analysis / Poor Solution,"This book provides a good overview of what children should learn year by year, subject by subject, and how parents can help them achieve their educational goals. One reviewer complained that the authors overemphasized the importance of limiting T.V., and reading to kids, but I am a teacher and can tell you that many parents don't bother to take those basic but crucial steps with their kids. The authors offer a good analysis of the problems with public education today (which both parents and schools can contribute to), but their main solution to the problems of the educational system is standardized testing. As a teacher in Texas, where high-stakes testing rules the public school system, I have learned that placing such overwhelming emphasis on an annual test does not raise the standards of students' educations; it has actually caused too many schools to teach to the test, cheat, and neglect the needs of gifted students in order to prep the slower ones for the tests."
2,A good yarn,A reasonable read. Good story line although I expected it to be about captain cochrane himself. Worth a look at.
4,from hi to lo,"I'll declare from the outset that I haven't seen the film, so I don't know if the music unfolds on the disc in the same order as it does in the film. My guess is probably not, and therefore the (much less interesting) orchestral score wouldn't drag the chain like it does on the cd - which is very much an album of 2 distinct halves. The initial block of country, country swing, ""novelty"" and tex/mex tracks move along very nicely until the disembodied dynamics of the orchestral movements grind towards a finale. Still, the format does make it easier to switch off after the first section, rather than skipping tracks here and there. Hey, maybe that's why the distributors did it that way. Doh!!"
4,Using Borland Paradox 7 for Windows 95 & NT,"After several months of searching, as this book was already out of print, I finally located a used copy and it turned into the best buy for me in a long time. With an extensive index and related subject references at the end of each chapter, navigating the book is easy. It's size is enough to make most readers weak in the knees, but if it's treated more as a reference book to be used as the situation arises, you'll soon reserve a place of honor on the desk for easy reach. Most of the instructions are easy to understand, even for beginners like myself. There are some areas I've avoided for when I feel more comfortable, but that is a very small portion of the book. I do sometimes wish the examples were a little less basic to help take the reader beyond the very simplest concepts of database management. But, then again that's what really makes this book so helpful in the first place. After two years of regular use, I still refer to it for a refresher."
5,Screen Issues Nonexistant,"I got a Creative Zen Vision for Christmas and I'm been sold since. First off, Apple's iPod (I have a second generation version and I just sold my Nano) has a great design and easy-to-use interface but honestly, I don't think the sound quality is all that amazing. Reading about Creative's products, I was interested to hear if the sound quality really was better than iPod. The reviews were true - sound quality on this PVP is simply amazing. iPods lacked bass, this player thumps on my Bose QuietComfort 2's. The screen is large enough to watch videos on (I watched several when I flew back to school). The player is meant to be held in your hand and as mentioned... it's meant to play portable video, not to as a replacement to the home theater. Check this player out (or the new Creative Zen Vision: M) before you drop money on the new iPod. You won't regret the decision."
4,Good product,"Have had this for almost a year now.Pros:The battery life is good.FM radio and recording.Video out.Removable batteryCan also double as a portable hard disk for photos during travel (bought the flash card adapter for SD card use)Cons:The video angle can get irritating as you have to look straight at it but when (if) found, its very good (but not as good as PSP)I would recommend this over the iPod as I've used both. Its also easier (and MUCH faster) to transfer videos to the Zen than to the iPod."
3,"Like the idea, but product has issues","I love the look and the idea of the Creative Vision, but I've had quite a few problems with mine, and it's only a month or so old. First, the device kept freezing up when I plugged it into the computer. I finally figured out that the USB cable was faulty. So then I got another USB cable that's OK. So then it worked fine for a month or so, at which point, now it's started to freeze up for no reason. A few days ago, it just froze when I was viewing photos on it. Today, it froze when I plugged it into a computer under its flash drive function. When it's not having any problems, it's a beautiful device, and I love it. But it's flaws are disappointing..."
1,Barely Better Than The Previous Version,"I had my Creative Zen Vision for all of about 3 hours. Having previously owned a 20GB Creative Zen Portable Media Center and being completely unsatisfied with it I was really hoping that Creative had gone the extra mile and learned from their past effort. Well, 3 hours into things I discovered they did a few things right but one thing horribly wrong. The screen quality is just plain awful. If people are finding a decent angle at which to hold their's then that's great, I couldn't find one at all. You'll spend more time fidgeting, trying to find an optimum angle than you'll ever spend actually enjoying a movie on the thing. It's simply a cheap lousy screen.The rest of the unit is fine. The construction is solid, the interface very easy to use (though the included software isn't all that great), and even the sound is pretty good - but let's face it, we buy these things to watch movies on and if they can't handle that then what good are they?"
3,missing piece,My husband and I thought the puzzle was very beautiful and fun to do. The reasons for the three stars was 1.)there was one piece missing and 2.) The way the puzzle was cut was sometimes very difficult to tell if two pieces really went together or not when the colors were so close. Often times we would put two pieces together only to find out later that they didn't go together.
4,"A big F for Family and for fun, fun, fun!!!","This was one of the best books I've read all year. I loved reading about all the family members' personalities, some of which were very familiar. My favorite part was the reunion itself, when all the main characters were together. There was more fun stuff going on at the end, at the wedding of a cousin; plus a big surprise at a family meeting. After the reunion the story turns to resolving the personal crises of the cousins in romance-novel fashion, with some overly long, somewhat repetitive love scenes. But the general theme running throughout the story is a strong sense of family that can bring tears to one's eyes. It's all about love."
4,A Family Reunion,Excellent book. Lots of twist and turns and it shows the love of family and how love is the glue to keeping any family together. I love Brenda Jackson's books and this one is another one of her well written novels that I thoroughly enjoyed.
4,"Good book, but not so great ending",This was the first Brenda Jackson book I've read. I was really into the book the whole time but was greatly disappointed in the ending. It seemed to me as thought the author put a lot of details and drama throughout the book and then such a flat/dry ending. Overall a good read. I do recommend it.
5,True Family Pride,"A really really great book. A true page turner. Written in Mrs. Jackson's usual style that is uniquely her own. I strongly suggest you pick up a copy and after pick up ""The Savvy Sistahs"". (the sequel that tells Brandy's story)"
4,Good book for the prepared reader,"This is a reissue of a 1964 work. MacIntyre provides a new introduction that critically reviews what he sees as the strength and weaknesses of the book. The book itself, however, is unchanged from the 1964 text.Beginners will find this a difficult book to work through. MacIntyre presumes the reader has a basic understanding of the ideas and philosophers he discusses.But for those with adequate background this is a wonderful book, full of many insights. Be warned, though, this book is not a neutral review of the subject matter. In this book MacIntyre lays the groundwork for his own particular version of ethics (developed most fully in After Virtue).Much of the book is dense and part of it is, arguably, poorly written. But it is worth the work needed to get through it."
2,Not a lot to recommend.,"This series is my first experience reading Moorcock. I am usually an avid reader, but I kept finding myself making excuses to do anything except get back to this book. The characters lack sympathy and depth. There are plenty of battles, but the plot stringing them together feels stale and sketchy. I'll probably finish the series out of sheer stubbornness, but I wouldn't recommend this book or the series to someone who is not already a fan of the author."
4,Super Reader,"Hawkmoon, Duke of Koln, is a resistance leader in the fight against the Dark Empire. Knowing this, the Mad God, with the power of the amulet of the Runestaff, arranges to kidnap Hawkmoon's wife, Yisselda.The Eternal Champion has no option but to try and get her back, even in the face of the Mad God's power."
2,Meandering and pointless,At least it has the saving grace of being short. Our two heroes wander aimlessly from adventure to adventure in a series of dull vignettes.
5,Leave your sanity at the door,"Seriously - take this film for what it is, watch some of the best actresses ever chew the scenery and enjoy! Don't expect anything too profound - but watch the faces! Just watching Emmanuel Beart pout is worth the cost of the film alone. This is a film in love with the idea of woman but appalled at the reality. Understand that and all else becomes clear. I rate this as one of my top 50 films because I enjoy watching actors act with subtle changes in facial expressions - only the most skilled can do it (without resorting to stock expressions a la Keanu Reaves)and this film is filled with some of the best.Oh by the way of you are a fan of cheesy French Rock and Roll I deny you not too hum along to the first number. The UK DVD has the full version of this as an extra."
1,hello kitty is better,"Oh dear. If 7 brides for 7 brothers is one of your favorite movies then by all means buy 8 women which is equally silly. Life is Weird and so is this film directed by Francois Ozon who should have been kicked out of the academy for this one. Arnaud De Moleron, the set director, should never be employed again. The set is so ugly is steals attention away from the silly action and songs in film. Fanny Ardant is beginning to look quite piggy in the face although her figure is still fine. If the intention was to make a movie in the vein of 1950s Hollywood drama/musical this film fails on all accounts. Unless you are a die hard fan of someone in the film don't waste your money."
2,Mainly for movie addicts,"On first sight this is just a whodunnit: during a roaring snow storm the man in the house is murdered and the 8 women who are left behind all have had a reason to murder him. The cast is impressive (where else do you find 8 superstars together in one movie?), but the story line is rather thin.This is because the story is not the major feature of the movie, but the references to other movies and genres are. Unfortunately, when you are not a movie addict (I admit I am not), most of the references will go unrecognized and what remains is a lot of over the top acting and childish, and often not very well sung,songs. A movie which will be certainly enjoyed by people who have a good knowledge of movie history, but it was not for me."
1,Awful,"I dozed off part way through the film and then after watching another ten minutes just turned off the DVD player. The film seems to be aiming to be a comedy, but fails utterly. It can not be anything else except for a very weak (dark) comedy."
1,Not good,This is exactly the type of movie I'm trying to avoid. I have no idea how I came into possession of this but keep it far away from me.
2,Whodunit? A french Version of CLUE,"I don't know how to review this honestly as I am split down the middle. In all honesty it reminds me of the American film ""Clue"". Everyone is stranded in a big house, one person gets murdered, and everyone has a motive. I didn't like the musical numbers and really the film didn't hold my interest very well. I did get a kick though when the mistress arrives, sees her dead lovers body, screams, then runs to the firplace and starts singing and stripping off her clothes while singing lines such as ""When the bill comes, you have to pay"".Watch ""Clue"" instead, it is much more entertaining."
1,SEE 8 1/2 WOMEN INSTEAD,Imagine getting snowbound in a cabin with 8 WOMEN (Universal) and a dead body and then have to witness each woman sing and dance (badly) as they tell their story. Who dunnit? Who cares! A whopping French dud. See 8 1/2 women instead.
2,"Half the substance, twice the cheese.","Oh, my was this awful. It was a desperate-to-be-different movie with corny dialogue and even cornier subplots. The characters are two dimensional and are all arrogant in one way or another(other than the maid). You just can't have a ""wacky"" and risque movie; the mediums simply don't mix as is proof in this film. I am a fan of our ArtHouse movie theater, and attend regularly, but this movie was one of the worst I've seen there. I would not recommend this to anyone."
1,Oh no - I had to end it!,"I agree with the others that gave it one star. I was expecting a much different movie. It was trying to be different, quirky, and funny and it was none of these things. I did not care about the characters because there was nothing of substance to care about. I realize it was a comedy that was supposed to be light and funny, but it did not make me laugh, in fact I was cringing at the performances especially the established older actresses. The songs were awful or maybe it was the bad singing and choreography. I am no movie critic and so if you want to risk the money be my guest. But, I rarely turn off a movie half way through and this I had to - booorrrrrinnnggg!"
1,As bad as Moulin Rouge,"As a non-traditional student (having taught French for over 20 years before returning to graduate work)pursuing a doctorate in French, I`ve seen a lot of fine French films. 8 Femmes isn`t one of them. For a charming musical, for example, see Sous les toits de Paris directed by Rene Clair in the early 1930`s. The forgettable songs in 8 Femmes are stiffly rendered by actresses who can`t sing and can`t dance. The drama of the murder plot is oddly juxtaposed against giddy females singing about, well, who knows what? The songs are not organic to the movie, just added on at odd intervals so each of the eight ladies gets a chance to demonstrate her non-talent. Where is Ginger Rogers when you need her? And you need a score card to keep track of all the ladies who are in reality lesbians. The scene with Fanny Ardant on top of Catherine Deneuve was, well, beyond words. Kindly run, do not walk, to the nearest exit."
3,"5 stars for the movie, 0 for the DVD","I just received the DVD and It's awful. It doesn't contains any extras (I wouldn't count the theatrical trailer as one). But that I was expecting. What really makes this DVD awful is that it comes with the option of Spanish subtitles, but since the English subtitles can't be removed, using the Spanish subtitles means watching the film with 2 subtitles (I don't know who came out with that idea), which also means seeing letters over the actresses faces.If I hadn't loved this film I would be returning this DVD."
3,bare bones dvd edition of gallic fluff,"This is a silly bit of fluff but it is fun and looks great. How could it not, with so many terrific French actresses all playing to stereotype as the wife, sister, sister-in-law, mother-in-law, cook, chambermaid and daughters of a murdered man, stranded on an estate and gradually coming to the realization that there is a murderer among them? A 1960's mise-en-scene and appropriately gorgeous costumes cannot entirely make palatable the songs or the plot, such as they are.DVD extras, there are none. You can see the French with English or Spanish subtitles. (Unlike another reviewer has said, there is not the option to select ""8 Femmes"" and see the film without subtitles. In addition, the Languages screen does not let you change the settings except to ADD Spanish subtitling -- at the top of the screen!) The only extra is a trailer. Paltry fare indeed.Worthwhile viewing only if you are a devotee of French cinema."
4,Outrageous - a Must-See!,"Having caught this cinema release in Dec '02, I was counting the days until I could get my hands on my own copy! I had the girls in work dancing to the internet soundtrack - what a riot!AND WHAT A CAST! Eight beautiful, sexy and wonderful actors.Vanilla DVD a little disappointing - What I would have given for interviews, especially with Catherine and Fanny!A MUST SEE!"
2,Doesn't Work!,"For all the famous names in this movie, soomething better should have come out of it. It was predictable from the first, and the twists and turns were just silly. They couldn't leave the estate, although one of them managed to arrive from the outside. Just about every one was involved in something illicit, or at least in something strange. Lovers were talked about but not really discussed. The biggest bombshell involving supposed incest was discussed by just two of the eight and nothing was made of it. This movie was just an unrelated bunch of snippets that just doesn't work."
3,Watch it for the actresses only,"The constant catfights, tirades and ""shocking revelations"" became really too much at some point. Worth watching if you're a fan of these great actresses but the plot is one of the worst I've ever seen.It's a shame, because the characters are captivating. If the movie had sort of taken a turn about halfway through and left out all the subsequent absurdity, then it could have been great."
3,Wacky and Kooky,"Okay, this is the Euro ""whodunnit"" of the Decade. Alright, we have eight women (they even throw one in who suffers from cardiac arrhythmia just for hilarity) who end up in the same house for various reasons only to discover that a mystery is unfolding... (I don't want to ruin the ending so I'll stop here.)"
1,more than bad,this is for sure the badest and most boring film i have ever seen (i swear).8 women in one room for more than 5 minutes is by far too much.and everybody has to sing a chanson.this is horrible !
1,Femme Fatales or Very Lame?,"Terrible direction, terrible writing, it almost feels like the director didn't know what he was working with. Although this movie wanted to be in the same race and quality of the movie CLUE, it fails to realize that the plot and characters are incredibly riculous and not funny ha ha but funny stupid. It was a total watse of good celluloid."
5,So pleased...,I've loved this movie for the longest and I'm so glass that it was available. Great customer service from the vendor and a quality product. So excited to add it to my collection.
5,"Amazing, powerful, respectful patriotism, exceptionnal,","it announces the dawn of a terrible war. Nick has landed a new REFERENCE work here, I'm sure he will get lots of high level soundtracks to do in the near future.This soundtrack is immensely powerful and moving. I strongly urge you to listen to it on a powerful system with deep bass capacities!.I HIGHLY recommend it. Repeted listenings is unavoidable, it's so much deep and moving. the movie itself was reference imho."
2,we were soldiers original motion picture score,i bought this cd for one song on it sgt. mackenzie and i was disappoint that the it was broken up into three parts on the cd
5,Great Companion to the Movie,"Like the movie, this score draws the listener into the feel, action, suspense and drama of the story. Like all great scores, this too is great to listen to while reflecting on the events of the movie/true events, and/or prepare you to see it again."
2,We Were Solidiers,"Loved the movie, love the music. However, there are 17 tracks with different titles but the song is the same on each one. Very disappointing."
4,Workout - not instructions,"They aren't entirely clear this isn't a linear follow up to the first DVD in the ""Series"" which is focused on technique and movement. This one is more of a straight up workout dvd that is presented over 3 levels depending on your own fitness level. It's not bad and I do hope the series comes back."
2,HARD!,"I'm a good hoola hooper, but when it comes to the super advanced stuff that they are doing..NO WAY! Popped it into my dvd player once, I don't even know where it is now. I was so hard!"
5,Modern spirituality at its finest.,"Perhaps the finest spiritual book in print, Kazantzakis' _Zorba_the_Greek_ simultaneously praises the spirit and the body, affirming human existence like no other tale around.Alexis Zorba is a hero the likes of which haven't been seen since Odysseus or Sinbad the Sailor. He combines gruff physicality with love of life without falling into the selfish hedonism one might expect. Zorba is indulgent, but never in such a way that his character is destroyed.Zorba incarnates the soul, both for himself and for the reader. The ""Zorbatic"" theology provides for the world a God and a belief in that God that refuses to deny life, never turning against what it is to live."
3,Translation Trouble,"Really, this is a wonderful novel. The only reason why I give it three stars is that the translation is awful. Clearly the translator either cannot appreciate the wonderful langauge of the author, or he has no appreciation for the possbilities of English prose, or both. A new translation is sorely needed for this title."
5,Zorba?,"On several unrelated occasions through college and a bit afterwards, I was told by various folk that I ""was Zorba,"" or was like Zorba, or was ""a Zorba"". I knew of the reference, but having never read the book did not understand its implications. I recommend this book not because I subsequently found the comparison to be flattering (I did), but rather because Kazantzakis is able to grab hold of grand romantic themes - youth, idealism, nationality, tradition - and really give them a solid drubbing. Similarly I would recommend ""A Hero For Our Time"", by Mikhail Lermontov. Good, earthy, bookworm-bashing timepieces, both."
4,"Classic, Must Read","Alexis Zorba is one of the most highly fleshed out, full bodied characters of all time His philosophy and random acts of ""insanity"" may very well change your way of thinking and of living life."
3,Mixed feelings,"The story of the friendship of two men, and the different ways they experience life. One through, living, through real and personal experiences. The other through observations, reading and writing.I still don¡t know how I feel about the book. I have mixed feelings about it. I¡m very impressed that this book, written years ago, contains ideas and thoughts which are so advanced, or should I say timeless, which continues to apply to today¡s world. However, I admit that I have to struggle with the book,the language, though beautiful, can be quite difficult to follow and there are many ideas which I do not agree to, in the modern world, of course, they will be looked upon with distaste, particular how women were viewed at that time."
5,"endearing character, lilting prose, eternal questions","Zorba is perhaps the most memorable of characters. His ethos and pathos speak to each of us. He is ebullient, passionate, bruttish and fragile. He is alive with the questions of humanity and the pathos of Greek heroism. It is sad to finish the novel. Comforting to find him waiting in its pages."
3,Zorba the Greek by Nikos Kazantzakis,"The narrator is an isolated figure who prefers to experience life through books. His personality it juxtaposed with Zorba who does not have time for books, as he is inunduated with the sensual pleasures of life.Zorba is in direct contrast to the Pauline teachings of the western soteriology, and in particular the Roamn Catholic Church. As Zorba encourages a Catholic Priest to embrace ""his devils"" and burn down the monastary, the reader starts to see how the novel is a statement against the establishment of the Pauline church. Kazantzakis uses Zorba to explore how western ideas of Christianity can lead to an unproductive lifestyle."
3,"Zorba, the essence of life","The whole book is a dialogue between Zorba: an incidentally found Greek friend and the Englishman.Zorba tries to explain what life means to him and howmuch different is this from what his friend understands from life.His message is clear:life is short and fragile and paradoxically this tragically short time, contributes to its beauty.If life was indefinite the meaning of everything would be different to us.We have to do our best for there is no other chance to live once again.The Englishman is somehow overly serious on everything and does not consider the fact that nothing in life deserves such seriousness.Zorba teaches him some important lessons which can not be found in any book.He shows to him how to enjoy genuine aspects of life like love,music and eating.Zorba is in fact reflecting the mentality of Greek people. This mentality is in sharp contrast with the rest of Europe, specially England: where his friend comes from."
2,Pretty Good...,"I wouldn't go so far as to call it brilliant. Zorba is a refreshing and likeable character, but at times i felt that he was a bit too preachy, his dialogue a bit overly pedantic. The story to me felt a bit too long and choppy, with not much of a plot. But there are a few interesting and beautiful moments that reminds us to enjoy life to the fullest. Like I said, not a brilliant book, but pretty good nonetheless."
1,This is a classic?,"I received this book as a gift from a friend who raved about it. I gave it an honest try, but I found this book unreadable. Maybe it's the translation from the original Greek text, but the sentence structure was very hard to follow. That being said, I found Zorba to be the type of person I would actively avoid spending any time with. Longwinded, drunken, sexist, and generally unpleasant. The narrator was annoying in his hero worship of Zorba, also. This book gave me a headache, and made my temples throb. I only gave it one star because Amazon doesn't allow negative stars. I found it to be awful."
5,Jessye Norman is simply unparalleled!,"Instead of referring to Jessye Norman as ""Diva"", we should refer to her as the ""Supreme Diva"". Her interpretation of French and German repertoire is unequalled. Miss Norman's rich, oceanic voice enraptures the listener. Buy this recording...you will not be disappointed."
4,"Bose Are Great on Planes, Fair On Trains,Poor w/ Cell Phones","I have had a pair for over a year. I travel to Europe quite a bit and have been very pleased with them on planes. They really help to make air travel tolerable. However, on trains (Amtrak, MetroNorth) they pick up a slight buzz every once in a while. Also, if my cell phone is powered on and within 1-2 feet of the Bose, they pick up a buzz every 5 minutes - very annoying and makes the Bose almost worthless. Bose technical support responded with a polite, ""... There is so much potential for electronic pollution that it is nearly impossible to create an electrnoic product that is not subject to some kind of interference."" For $299, they should be able to eliminate the interference or be more upfront with their potential customers. Or at least, engineer them so that you could use them as regular headphones w/o the noise reduction on.If cell phones are allowed on planes, I would not recommend this product."
3,Good Sound / Poor Manufacturing Quality,"I live in Asia and travel alot. I love the headphones, but I have had to have two sets replaced due to the breakage at the arms within two years. Part of my job in Asia is to reduce our costs on equipment, but clearly the oringinal design was flawed on a basic engineering stress design you would not expect from Bose. My third set they replaced for no charge has a design change, however a company such as Bose should admit a major problem and have a recall or replacement, at no charge.If you have the the orignal model it will break."
2,Poor build quality - too bad.,"I've owned a pair of QC2's for about a year now, and after about 6 months they started making an annoying squeaking noise if I wore them while walking. Then this morning, I went to put them on my head, and the headband cracked, making them pretty much useless.I've had $50 headphones built much more solidly than these."
3,Alex,"IAs a few others have said, the sound quality is great imo especially with the noise canceling activated. Unfortunately the material is cheap and the earpieces broke both of after extended use(about 2 years)."
3,"Great sound, but shoddy material is a scandal!","I want to endorse what others have said. The sound really is great and gets the most out of mp3 players, but mine broke the third week I had it. The ball-and-socket where the earpiece attaches to the headband seems to be the Achilles heel. A small crack was enough for the ball to come out. My attempt to reinsert it was successful the first time but didn't last long; the second time the entire housing split into three fragments. I hope they've corrected this in the 3 and 15 models. For the time being, I'll stick to earbuds."
1,Go with Sony instead,"with regards to sound, this is a very good headsetThe noise cancelling features are very good ---- unfortunately, the 'phones suffer from discomfort and priceI compared these headphones, head to head, on an airplane, against the Sony MDR NC20, and there was no difference in sound - both performed excellently, and equally, within the airplane environment ---- however, the Sony ones were more comfortable and MUCH cheaperDon't even waster your time with the Bose Quite Comfort ---- grab a pair of the Sony's and you'll fall in love!"
2,Defective Plastic,My Bose headphones are extremely lightly used. This is the second time the plastic has broken on the headphones. My husband has had to duck tape them. Bose wants to charge me $100 to replace their defective product.
2,Good headphones until the buzzing started,"I am reviewing the Bose Quiet Comfort Series 1 headphone. I got this set as a gift and used it occassionally for travel. I found the headphones too bulky to take with me most of the time. Still, I found the noise cancelling to be great and enjoyed the sound quality. Unfortunately, the headphones began making loud vibrating noises after about a year (and 15 total hours) of use. Bose will fix them for $100 or offer me a credit toward a trade in on the Series 2 of $112 (I would pay $188 + tax vs $300). I am not impressed enough to pay this for a new pair."
2,"Good sound, but flimsy construction","In my opinion, the sound quality is quite good. However, as other reviewers have pointed out, these headphones are not durable. I have been treating mine with plenty of care, but today, 6 months after my purchase, they simply fell apart. The headband broke in two places: on both sides, one just below where it says ""R"", and the other side just above where it says ""L""."
5,Very good headphones,"I am overall very delighted. The headphones are sitting tight on the ears, are comfortable for hours, even if you wear glasses. The mentioned pressure is negligible and at least they produce a warm and pleasent sound. I listen mostly to classical music, so, I can't say much about other categories. With my Ipod they sound great, also with my PSP. I like the feature to disconnect the cords and have a cordless noise canceling device. I tested it in the parked car with the engine on and the A/C running on high. It is as advertised an oasis of silence. I compared them to my AKG HEARO 999 AUDIOSPHERE I, which was twice as much, and I like them more. They are well manufactured, there is no jiggle, and the carriage bag is very nice. Afterall, I don't think they should be used on skateboards (for security reasons!), or in the gym, they are too expensive to risk a damage."
5,Excelent,"These earphones are fabulous! For my, noisy enviroments aren't a problem anymore. Once you put them on, you are the only one in the room! The earpieces are very comfortable."
2,good sound but non-servicable,"The sound quality is good. However, do your research. There is a design flaw in the headband whereby the plastic covering on the sides will crack after 2+ years of use. Turns out, after contacting bose, the headphones are neither factory nor user serviceable. You can exchange them in for a new pair at $100 cost. That's right, if anything breaks whatsoever, you are expected to buy a whole new pair. So instead of just stocking spare plastic headband parts for $2, bose wants you to pay $100 for another pair once these fall apart. I don't know about you, but for $300, I expected them to last a bit longer."
4,No contest if you are a frequent flyer,"I have owned a Bose QC2 for a couple of years and I can assure you that your money is well spent if you are a frequent long haul flyer. As a business traveller who takes more than 100 flights a year, I have tried various types of phones (noise cancel/regular type of various designs - over the ear, in-ear, behind the ear, etc. from Sony, JVC, Panasonic, Grado) and this one comes out winner hands down. If you are an audiophile and do not have requirements for noise cancellation, go for a Grado. But don't leave home without a Bose QC2 if you are a road warrior.P.S. 1) I find QC2 more comfortable than QC3 on long flights.2) Most airlines now offer decent noise cancellation phones on business and first class, but they come with proprietary connectors...so, if you want to listen to your own stuff, stick with the QC2."
2,Wait for the better version,"Bose is supposed to have a good reputation in innovative audio technology. But, this attempt at ""Acoustic Noise Cancelling"" is a misnomer, in fact, plain misleading. It may reduce some engine noise in the plane, but you hear everything else, including screaming chidren and chatty passengers. The idea is good, but the technology is nowhere there. I'm returning mine back."
1,"no highs, no lows, must be bose ... but worse, no quality","headphones need to withstand at least some not so ideal conditions. my AKGs and Sennheisers have survived more than 25 respectively 15 years of use. sometimes they got dropped or i fell asleep while wearing them. and they still serve me well 'til this day and still sound perfect. not so the Bose set i bought in 2004. in 2005 the plastic parts holding the ear pieces to the frame broke. i fixed them on one side just to see them break on the other. then the plastic skin covering the foam padding started to come off. apart from being annoying, the chemical stench coming from the foam was sickening. i gave up on repairing the set and just recently tossed it in the trash bin promising myself never to touch Bose, ever, ever again. i am happy with a cheap Koss set now that at a fraction of the price sounds about as good and it still works."
1,worst investment,"Paid $300.00 for these about 5 years ago. After about 2 years of light use the ear pad vinyl fell apart and the head bar rubber padding became very sticky, comes off on your fingers and gets on everything. The replacement ear pads don't fit into the frame well and come out easily. The overall quality of sound and durability was very disappointing. I found several over-the-ear clip ear phones for under $10.00 to be superior in every way, including comfort, quality stereo, and I can use these cheaper ear phones when I'm sweating/exercising: don't try that with the Bose headphones! The Bose headphones didn't really cancel ambient noise. I don't use them anymore."
2,"Cheaply made, not worth the money they ask","I've had these for a couple of years, used them infrequently, and always stored them in their protective case. The sound is great, but the shoddy materials will soon make them unusable. The hinges on the ear pieces are cheap plastic and will break with even minimal use. Check out all the complaints ([...]) and give serious thought before buying these. It seems that not only is the product inferior, but the customer service is even worse."
1,Short in headphones,"There's a short in the Bose headphones I bought from this vendor, and I'm going to have to have them fixed. I'm not particularly happy. The headphones work well in the short periods when I can actually hear through them."
4,Quality Bose product,"As usual, another quality Bose product, however it is tired and has been replaced by a newer version of this model which I understand is more effective at canceling out noises."
1,Poor Plastic Quality - Brakes Easily,"The sound quality is pretty good and battery life OK but the quality of the plastic used is REALLY poor, the structure complex and fragile. The head-band brakets will brake where it encloses the size adjustment ""sliders"". When that happens the headphone comes loose and the headset is unusable. The peace of plastic could be sold for a few dollars for a quick fix but in fact you have to get through the repair cycle nightmare and it costs a lot ... not a good deal, I am now looking for something different I can use while sleeping on the plane!"
1,Good but shoddy!,"The noise canceling feature works well and the sound is good. However, the cheap plastic they are made of breaks easily. First one side broke but I managed to tape it together. Then the other side broke and was not fixable. You would think that something so expensive would be more durable!"
5,Bose knows,"my set of Bose QuietComfort 2 Noise cancelling headphones were purchased at a kiosk located in the heart of the Denver International Airport. i had heard of such noise cancel products and the use at the airport and on the flight were the perfect tests. this was over ten years ago the technology had only recently been made available to the public after years of perfection worn by pilots, maintenance workers and all who required phonic protection. The sound quality blew me away as i heard nuances in old familiar recordings i had never noticed and i could even run the vacuum cleaner without interference. The thing that really sold me was the genus of a design that allowed for the ease of replacement of the sound cord, the one part which always seemed to wear out or loss of signal because of weakened wiring, when meanwhile the speakers themselves are perfectly operational. Instead of losing an entire unit for replacement you can simply replace the cord. Perfection. Thank you"
2,"Excellent Audio, Poor Physical Construction","I've owned my pair for close to four years now and they are starting to physically deteriorate. The sound quality is excellent, as is the noise canceling. I used these in an office cubicle environment and later in a computer room, and the performance on my iPod is outstanding. But at this point the plastic upright on each earphone has broken and needs to be held together with wire ties, and the rubber cover on one of the ear pieces has worn through. Granted, I use them almost every day, but they don't see rough use - and this isn't the type of endurance I'd expect from a $300 product. The two year warranty isn't long enough to address these issues.UPDATED JANUARY 2009One of the ear pieces finally cracked at the pivot point and simply fell off. When I contacted Boise they did offer to replace them with a new set for $100."
2,"Fragile - suitable only for the Bubble-Boy, not frequent flyers","I am on my second pair of Bose QuietComfort 2 headphones - and like so many in the other reviews here both mine broke. The first time they broke I paid $100 for a replacement pair, and the replacement then started to crack in the same place as my first pair! So I quickly pulled out the black electrical tape and effected a repair before they completely broke again. My self-back-patting was shortlived however when they broke completely at the swivel joint, while I was wearing them. I treated these headphones with the utmost care and they still broke. I fly a lot and the noise cancelling really helps reduce the fatigue from the engine roar so I will try another manufacturer, probably Sennheiser. I always found the sound quality to fine, not great but when you're on an aircraft you don't expect much. But I do expect something that costs $300 to be able to stand up to the rigours of everyday life."
3,Comfortable but expensive and lower than expected quality...,"I got these as a gift to wear at work (in an extremely people-noisy environment). They do a better job than any other headphone I've tried. They are the MOST comfortable headphone I have ever worn. That said, I've had to exchange them twice. They are pretty fragile for the price - but the Bose store near me has exchanged them both times without a problem. (The only hassle is finding time to go over there.)The battery life is not the best, but I can live with it. I don't like the idea of having to have the noise cancelling feature ON (using battery life) to just listen to music, though. There are times I could use this headset and not need noise cancelling - but that is not an option, which it should be for $300.00.I've had mine for 3 months and am happy with them, other than the issues listed."
1,"There's much better out there, people!","Tried one of these in a Bose store, oh my God it was a joke. Drums sounded muddy and boomy at the same time, highs were shrill and unnatural, and voices sounded completely hollow.The Sennheiser PXC-300, at 2/3rds of this Bose's price, blows it out of the water in all departments: noise cancellation, physical comfort, and most of all, SOUND QUALITY.Me, I'm no hoity-toity ""audiophile""---but I do have friends who are audiophiles, and they do plenty of headphone listening, contrary to the previous reviewer. In fact, many audiophiles will tell you that a two hundred dollar pair of quality headphones can easily surpass the sound quality of a two thousand dollar pair of speakers!To be fair these Bose headphones sound slightly better than the under-100 dollar competition by Sony and Phillips. But compared to my Sennheisers at 2/3rds of the price, they're toast."
2,from a reader,"I was delighted to get a copy at last.It started of fairly well,getting realy hard to read toward the end.Being such a long time hunter in the African bush I wondered why he could not fill the book with his exciting experiences.Which I am hoping he must have plenty. One thing I must mention here I am sure John Taylor is a proffessional butthroughout this book I am greatly disturbed abouth his continiues comments good and bad about the other great elephant hunters.I personaly think that,it takes a lot away from this book and its reading pleasure."
5,A great historical novel,This book covers Grant's life from when he was young all the way though to his death. The book showed us what a complex and interesting person Grant was. I truly enjoyed reading this book and found it very hard to put down. The book draws you into Grant's life and lets you experience his life's triumphs and tribulations. Anybody who likes good historical fiction will enjoy this book. My brother also read this book and really enjoyed it.
5,Grant in all his Glory,"When I first bought this book, I thought I was taking a chance. But from page one, Robert Skimin takes you on a wonderous journey of one of the most interesting men in US History. It starts out with a few stories from U.S. Grant's early childhood and moves to his years at Westpoint, to the Mexican War, to his life during peacetime. Obviously the main part of the book is dedicated to the Civil War, but that is to be expected. Skimin takes you to Fort Henry, Donelson, Shiloh, Vicksburg, and the Wilderness Campaign. You have Lee surrendering to Grant and the Grant's life after the Civil War, including his scandal-torn presidency. Skimin keeps the book interesting as you follow the life of Ulysses S. Grant. This book is a must read if the Civil War or this point of history is even of slight interest."
2,Yet Another Blah Grant Novel,"Ulysses S. Grant was a complex, fascinating personality who led a dramatic, multi-faceted rollercoaster of a life. Why hasn't anyone been able to write a decent novel about the guy? ""Ulysses"" accomplishes a near-impossible feat: It succeeds in making Grant look dull. His life is presented as a series of brief, disconnected, uninvolving scenes, the personalities are as flat as my computer monitor, and Skimin's idea of plot and character development is to get Grant drunk on every other page, even at moments when not even his hostile biographers accuse him of getting plastered. Poor Ulys deserves better. Calling all talented dramatists--here is your next project!"
3,what do you expect for the price,"30days in...this backgammon is tearing at the corners and you can see the cardboard. I havent been rough on it becuase another review said she sent it back after examining the pointy corners that were going to wear quickly. Well, i thought quickly meant about 1yr. if you have beautiful wooden or leather furniture, i would not recommen leaving the cheap clasps fully open as they will scratch or rip your valuables. the chips are thin and have extra space in the holding slot; you can play no less. the out side is gray with black strip. i thought it would be black. i was disappoint by this. maybe i missed something. the quality is terrible... but i got a gammon set and i can buy another on next year. sorry i dont see a place to upload a picture. i think i will opt on the 15"" size."
2,poor quality.,"I sent this set back within seconds of inspection. The corners were already dented, the glue holding the thin felt in place on the sides and corners had already failed. I went to my nearby store and purchased a much higher quality set for the same money. this is not a good set for any serious backgammon player."
2,"Nice board, very poor quality","Pro:Nice size, a bit smaller than tournament size, slim attache.Nice colorsCon:Durability/quality is poor. Stiching on one point is defective, there is a large discoloration in the felt, and one of the dice is disintegrating."
4,backgammon game,"Seems to be of good quality, good game board. Price could be lower though as on most things. I paid the price because it was a gift."
4,Great Family Game,"Backgammon is a great game to learn and play. My son is learning fast and beating dad already. This board is a great size for all ages, the pieces are weighted well and prvide good gameplay. The vinyl seems durable enough for home use and should provide years of fun. Very good value."
4,Only one problem with the backgammon set,"I purchased a new backgammon set and it arrived in perfect condition. The only problem I had was the black pieces. They were somehow discolored on every one. This problem was not present on the white. Everytime I play it the black pieces bother me. I would like instructions on getting another set of black pieces. I feel that I should not have to pay since this set was not cheap. Please advise.Thanks,Gary H."
4,Backgammon Attache,"This backgammon set is beautiful and if you like backgammon, then it is a great addition to your game repitoire and worth the value."
4,Backgammon is fun,"This board is not a top of the line board by any stretch. With that being said, it is was the least expensive in its class. We use it at the beach quite a bit and so far it is holding up well. I worry that the outside cover may get torn when it has been sitting in the sun all day (it tends to get soft). My wife and I enjoy playing against each other... well mostly I enoy it! Winning is fun. Anyway, I suggest this product if you need an inexpensive board that you are not using as a display piece."
5,"Cream All The Way, Baby!","In regards to Eric Clapton's recording, many of his songs after Cream, though extraordinary, lack the incredible guitar solos that are on this CD (I can't speak for his stuff before because I haven't heard very much of it). I never knew that rock could be done this well before I heard this CD. ""Sunshine Of Your Love"", ""White Room"", and ""Crossroads"" are definately my favorites. I think ""Crossroads"" is among the best performances Clapton has ever done. Buy this CD, its the best."
4,The only thing missing is...,"...The cover art from Disraeli Gears and Wheels of Fire! Great music in a compact and complete retrospective. The youthful energy of these takes is balanced with virtuosity. Whoever heard a bassist play guitar-style like Jack Bruce? Or a drummer play as conspicuously as Ginger Baker? And, of course, who ever heard a guitarist wail like the young Eric Clapton? Everyone should own some album with Crossroads on it. As a song not included here says, ""Those were the days."""
1,Save your money!,"My rating is not a reflection of the greatness of Cream, rather a forewarning to prospective buyers of this compilation. Before purchasing this compilation, consider that there is a vastly better one available for near the same price! ""The Very Best of Cream"" features all of the tracks presented ""Strange Brew"", an additional 8 tracks, and more extensive liner notes. Also ""The Very Best of Cream"", released in 1995, was the first Cream best of to be released exclusively on CD, and is mastered using Apogee's UV22 encoding that vastly improves the sound quality of the original songs, and the songs on this album. Save your money and get it instead!"
5,Great Band,"This band had a unique sound.I originaly got into this band because Kiss always mentioned this band as one of their favorite bands.As i am a huge Kiss fan,i am curious at time to listen to their musical origins.I knew Sunshine of your love and White Room.But the rest were not known at all to me.So i decided to get a copy of their best.Man i was not disappointed.Got right into it and couldnt stop playing it.Some songs seem to be addictive,probably recorded them on tapes made out of hippy weed.This collection is a must for fans of Clapton, Bruce, and Baker and the great rock of the late 60s. .Great stuff this,and i reccommend this band."
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS cd is awesome. I understand the parental advisory on it. They swear like madmen in this cd, yet I still like it. I heard ""Stick 'Em Up"" on the radio, but that's not the only reason I got this cd. There r many reasonz I got this cd, but it would take me 4ever to state them all. There r a ton of awesome songs on this cd like ""Tarfur"" and ""Weirdo"" besides ""Stick 'Em Up"". I HIGHLY suggest this cd to ANYONE who likes rap-rock."
5,Good stuff,"I bought this CD because I have heard the single Stick 'em up several times on the radio the lyric ""Im on the mic like a facist"" really jumps out and grabs you. The whole CD is really great, a good mix of hard rap metal stuff and a few slower balladish songs. Quarashi really reminds me a lot of 311 (think ""Down"") with a little bit of Cypress Hill mixed in. Good stuff, it sounds really smooth. If you like Linkin Park or 311 or any other rap/rock stuff you will like this. (I dont really care about Limp Bizkit anymore, most everything on Chocolate Starfish or whatever is just bad, their act is getting old)"
2,hmmm...,"Would I recommend it? Yes, but try to get it used. Also I would definitely buy their next in hopes that they may ""find themselves"" with a more well defined sound. You catch a bit of a sense that they are trying to be the Beastie Boys on another level... they need to just try to be Quarashi but they clearly aren't entirely sure who that is. The first track is by far the best on the album in my opinion, it absolutely rocks but the rest of it doesn't have the teeth that track does. If you like this first track don't buy the whole album for it, the entire album is only 41 minutes."
1,Only 1 thing even slightly remarkable,"Okay, I knew going into this CD that it'd be heavily rap influenced after hearing Stick Em Up. I was extremely disappointed. It's basically all rap. They just get some people who are not even listed as part of the band to play an occasional riff on the guitar or provide background bass. The only thing that made this CD worth it was ""tarfur."" it's supposedly the first rap song written entirely in Icelandic. However, Quarashi makes Limp Bizkit sound like Metallica, Quarashi is so heavily rap. I wouldn't recommend it, cuz they're not even very good MCs. I picked it up for 10 bucks, but I wouldn't pay any more for it if I were you."
2,below average,"i found this cd to be quite generic. the music, to me, was bland and lifeless. equal parts rap & singing, the vocals were predominant in the mix. the music was ok, heavy and slighlty melodic but i just never got into it. music should scream through your stero and say LISTEN TO THIS but this cd failed to grab my attention."
2,kind of cool at times,"i like quarashi's sound, it's fun and enegertic. but it doesn't really move anywhere or explore any possibilites. i think they have some real talent but these guys seem too content just throwing out obscene expressions like a bunch of 15 year olds that have finally gotten a hold of the main office's pa system. i have to say that the people who try to push these guys as sounding like korn are TOTAL MORONS. quarashi sounds sort of like the beastie boys on steroids...that's the best comparison i can think of. if you're not really looking for anything deep or particularly inspiring but instead want some mindless music, quarashi is fun. but if you have enough of that in your collection already, skip this one."
5,A Must Have CD,"In this world of lame metal/rap fronted by bands such as Limp Bizkit and Kid Rock it has been hard to find new original music. However, Quarashi's ""Jinx"" brings a whole new and unique sound to music. Their first single ""Stick'em Up"" is full of heavy guitar laced over some hard hip hop beats. Each song on this album shows the talent and range of Quarashi. Whether it's their harmonies, rhymes, beats, rock ability, or powerful lyrics there is definitely something for everyone on this album."
4,Can't Wait for Earl....,"Having read wilder Sisters, Bad Girl Creek and Now Along Came Mary I'm waiting not so patiently for Good Bye Earl! My favorite so far as been Bad Girl simply becuase I feel like I ""Know"" the characters...to me they are so typical of they way good friends see eachother, need eachother...and just know eachother. Mary was great with the added characters and dogs! Maybe someone will give me Earl for my birthday!!!"
4,Book in excellent condition,The book was delivered to me quickly. It is in excellent condition INCLUDING the dust jacket. My only issue (it is minor) it is in LARGE print. I do not require large print books...it's a little weird to read. I reviewed the description of the book and it does not mention it being a large print edition. I have no plans to complain or return the book. :)
3,Love the Bad Girls,"While I did not enjoy this as much as Bad Girl Creek, I still found it a good read. (I absolutely hated the way this began. What a shocker.) The characters are still as wonderfully flawed and we have added a new main character, Mary. And we have gotten some new insight on Rotten Rick. The Bad Girl books are about true friendships. Don't you wish we all had a Phoebe or a Ness in our lives?"
4,Another great one!,"She has done it again! Another great book in the Bad Girl series. It is true, although we don't get but glimpses here and there of our fav girls, we do get enough to feed the question of what is going on with each of them. This book only took me a couple of hours. I can't put them down! You won't be able to either! Enjoy!"
5,"great book, worth the read for making bows","If you are going to make a primative bow, this book is a great read. The book is to the point, easy to read and gives you the knowledge needed to make your first bow. Although there are many books written on to make a primative bow, this book is one of the most recommended."
4,I think you should read this.,"I think it was a very good book, especially if you are interested in Indian crafts or building a bow and arrow."
3,nice,These are fairly well made for the price. They do feel a little silky - but still synthetic. Nice medium weight. Tends to run very small. Would buy again.
2,Miss this one,"I like Faith Fairchild, but the author really missed on this one. It was boring. It had a weaak plot. There was little to figure out. Try another one."
5,Elli Review,"This is a really good book, it really brings to mind things that no one could have made-up, its just way too horiffic, but it DOES open your eyes to what power one man can have, and how people follow the majority, not standing up for others."
5,Limpy knows his stuff!,"Limpy takes the guess work out of sausage making. This book should be in every kitchen. From simple to complex, Limpy covers it all. I've tried some of the other sausage books out there. I've yet to find anything as good as this. Limpy brings you into the 21st century with his techniques. Some books are so out-dated you could make people sick. Limpy hides no fact or detail. You can trust him to show you how it's supposed to be done. I've been cutting wild game for over 15 years. I've come to rely on Limpy's book to guide a successful wild game processing business / sausage making business. Thanks for the wonderful book Limpy. Also, thanks for all you gave in Vietnam to make sure the rest of us could live free! Great book!"
4,Informative and Helpful,"Having this book for a couple of years now,and trying about 70% of the reciepts I find it on par with most other beginner books. If you follow the directions you can turn out some outstanding tasting and quality sausages with limited equipment or in depth knowledge."
4,Content of CD,"I was a bit disapointed by the CD, I thought it would be much more music that could be recognized from the movie. When I heard the 1st track movie scenes flew across my mind, but that was the only one! Maybe exept for track 13. If you like french rap, this is CD gr8. If you just want the movie music, get the 1st and 13th track somewherelese..."
3,Good Underground French Hip Hop,"You can find a good selection of french hip hop on this soundtrack. Unless you're from Marseille, most artists on this album could be considered as underground. It means that you won't get cheesy songs that give a bad reputation to french hip hop. Rap from Marseille can really hit you hard ! This album is good but for a better french hip hop compilation, I'd suggest Taxi 1 Soundtrack... It's way better."
2,Ok with some design problems,"Am trying to make due with it since I purchased. It's overpriced by $7 compared with the Spartan Sports Talking Pedometer (almost the same product except different colors for plastic). The stride mechanism also sticks occasionally and I have to shake the device to get it to work.I agree with previous comments - there are some problems. It's too easy to accidentally press the button on top that turns on the very annoying music, and it's too easy to accidentally press the button on top that turns the alarm on, and it's too easy to accidentally press the big button on the front that will speak the number of steps and distance you've walked."
5,My Neice Loved it,"I don't draw, and have no idea about this stuff. But I heard my 16 yr old neice took an art class and became interested in charcoal sketching. Gave it for Christmas and her face lit up like the tree. Was the perfect gift in this case."
2,ok,"It is a decent little kit, but not worth the $ you pay for it. Little disappointed, could have used more in the kit."
3,not much of an art set,This was for my grandson. The set was small and in an unimpressive container. The set contained only a small amount of drawing pencils.
2,Gag gift,"Purchased this DVD as a gag gift for my brother. He and his girlfriend watched it and said it was kind of raunchy. It was a good gag gift, but maybe not the best to watch."
3,A few yucks,"The movie had a few yucks in it. Personally, I think it is the same genre as Borat, only a little funnier overall."
1,Sticky yucky mess,"Deodorant control works by gluing you pits shut. Seriously, this stuff was sticky and nasty."
2,Greek myth for todays reader?,"I struggled with this book from the very beginning. I look at all the 5 star reviews and wonder what is wrong with me but the book was boring and never went anywhere. I found myself wading through a lot of unnecessary verbiage that only made it all go that much slower. And the story itself didn't grab me as being worth the read. Maybe I'm too impatient and want the writer to get to the point and have a little excitement, but I didn't find it as one of Lewis' better books even though it is touted as that. I'm not a great fan of Greek mythology and often struggle with Lewis' writing so the combination of these two did me in from the beginning. His writing didn't help me ""see"" what was happening, nor why. I guess I don't appreciate what the world calls ""great"" writing."
5,"An ""ancient"" story's trenchant comments on modern identity.","Upon my first reading of this book as a rather fundamentalist Christian teenager, I was disappointed with its seeming lack of an ""overt"" Christian message. During my second reading (and following a conversion to Roman Catholicism) approximately 15 years later, I was moved tremendously by protagonist Orual's tendency to clothe herself in defensive strength rather than yielding to faith. The book suddenly seemed very ""modern"" to me. I smiled as I wondered what Lewis would think if he were able to see (and indeed, hopefully he is) how accurately the book he wrote some 30 years ago reflects the struggle of women in the '90s. There is something deep lurking in this spare and somber prose for female AND male readers. If you have ever longed to plunge into mystery, to learn to balance your ultra-rational side with the faith-filled portion of your soul, then I strongly recommend this book to you. (By Lori Pike, on a friend's E-Mail)"
3,Till We Have Faces,"This is not anything against C.S. Lewis as a writer because I am a huge fan of his Narnia series. This is just a note of caution to the reader, I am an avid reader of mythology and the story of Cupid and Psyche is one of my absolute favorites. It has to be said that anyone who truly loves that myth should be forwarned before reading that it practically has no resemblance to the myth and is told from the viewpoint of one of Psyche's older sisters. I came to the book with preconceptions and was severely disappointed when I read it. I could not even completely finish the book."
2,I didn't think it was that great.,"Maybe it was because I didn't know the story of Cupid and Psyche before I read the book- but I was not overly moved by this book. I especially did not enjoy Part II, when I just kept wondering, what the heck is going on??? Thank goodness that Lewis included the summary of the traditional myth at the end- it might be helpful to read this part first."
3,I disagree with anyone that says this story has nothing to d,It does give an explanation of why Psyche was prompted to see who her mysterious husband was. The book just needs to be taken in the context it was written. A good read but I was a bit disappointed with the ending. Typical strangeness of C.S. Lewis but too cryptic and drawn out for me.
4,A good book that falls short of greatness,"The book is brilliantly written as long as it concerns itself with Orual's passionate indictment of the gods. It loses its power, however, when Lewis falls prey to his tendency to preach. Part 2 undermines the rest of the book first by telling the reader what to think and then by couching the lessons in an implicitly Christian moral context. In this way, it is reminiscent of ""The Last Battle,"" a coda which mars the otherwise enjoyable ""Chronicles of Narnia."""
4,Not the usual CS Lewis,"Having heard much about this book from a Wheaton professor, I finally read it with an expectation of receiving great insight. For that, I will have to re-read, I think. There are hints of truths, some of which I know I missed, since I am accustomed to didactic presentations. Didn't quite realize until the end that it is indeed a retelling of an old myth. At any rate, it is an interesting read, even if taken only superficially."
4,A powerful novel,"You may find this book slow-going at first, but stay with it. As Orual begins to ""find her niche"" she develops into a fascinating character and a strong protagonist. I thought this novel was extremely moving and highly enjoyable. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys C.S. Lewis, mythology, or a story featuring a strong and likable female protagonist."
5,Better ten years later,"I recently read Till We Have Faces again, having read it with disappointment over a decade ago when I was still in high school. After my first reading I sold or gave away my copy of the book, thinking I would never desire to read it again. I'm glad I changed my mind and gave it a second shot. It is a gripping tale which probes deep into the soul as it explores the destructive fruits of self-centered love and the need for reality in facing the deformities in our own souls. I couldn't put it down and plan to read it again in the future. Needless to say, I will hang on to this copy . . ."
3,Review of Till We Have Faces,"Not what I expected but still a good read. Unlike some of Lewis's other works, this book does not have such obvious links to Christian theology since it is based on Greek polytheism. However, the book does deal with the theme of how our limited knowledge of God and ourselves means we cannot often understand why difficult events in our lives happen from a theological perspective. If Lewis's Narnia books are a fable version of ""Mere Christianity"" then ""Till we Have Faces"" is loosely a fable version of ""The Problem of Pain""."
5,wow and ouch!,"probably one of the most incredible books that I've ever read. Read most of his works, but this one is incisive and piercing every time I revisit the agony of reality it presents. ""Lekhem panim"" in hebrew refers to the bread of G-d's presence, but literally translated is ""bread of faces"" and resides in the Holy Place. Something that we need for the nourishment of our souls, and CS Lewis is definitely the consumate baker."
1,This myth needs to be retold again,"This book is extremely hard/boring to read. If it weren't for the fact my book club decided on this book for December, I would have given up a long time ago on it."
3,Interesting but Flawed,"In ""Till We Have Faces"", C.S. Lewis has created an entertaining, thought provoking reinterpretation of the Greek myth of Cupid and Psyche. The myth, in his hands, becomes a Christian parable and an apologia for a transcendent god who remains unseen and unheard. Like his friend, J.R.R. Tolkien, I cordially dislike allegory. He has some interesting things to say about selfish love and authenticity, but the story drips with self-conscious wisdom and profundity. It left me with an aftertaste of narcissism."
5,"amazing, brutal, challenging","C.S. Lewis is so good at mixing faith with stories. Maybe that's why his stories are the most gripping. This retelling of Psyche and Eros is unpredictable and very moving. If Narnia is for children then ""Faces"" is a teaching fable for all adults."
5,ONE OF HIS BEST FICTION BOOKS!,"UPON THE CHORE OF MOVING ALL OF OUR STUFF TO ANOTHER CITY....I had the job of selecting the ones I will keep. When I came down to Till We Have Faces, I looked thru it till I realized that it was only one I had failed to read! So it will be my next read after unpacking!I have enjoyed the first few reviews here printed! I believe I have More C.S. Lewis than any other Author! It seems that my favorite ones have been The Four Loves, The Seven Storey Mountain, The Asian Journal, New Seeds of Contemplation, CONTEMPLATIVE PRAYER, DIALOGUES WITH SILENCE! AS I RECALL BEING IN LOUISVILLE, I DROVE TO THE MONASTERY OF GETHSEMENE and I saw the little house in which he spent time in Solitude writing.When I sat in the Choir for Morning Prayers, plus later in the day for other times of prayer, I realized the Power of Silence & Prayer connected to the litergy of Chants & Hymns! I surely returned to my Prison Chaplain's office with renewed Vigor!Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood"
4,If you have eyes to see...,"You will really enjoy this book. Lewis is one of those rare individuals that is able to express the truth with clarity and power, and you can feel it in your heart. I found this book to be beautiful and exciting and believe that one day we will all have faces."
1,Did I mention tedious...?,"Boring, snoring, not in the least alluring...obvious, sophomoric and terribly uninteresting...Oh yes, and did I mention tedious ? I'm sorry, but this book was torture from beginning to end (in my humble opinion). With a background in both Classics and Religion (to some degree) I very much looked forward to reading this book & liking it. There is just something about CSL's writing(s)that does not resonate with me, and I cannot say exactly what. I've read other works by him & felt much the same way afterwards. Perserverance is not always a good or noble thing I suppose, as the time spent reading this book could have been better used in more enlightening pursuits.Similar sentiments have been expressed to much greater effect (for me)in a number ofplaces...from the Bible to the classics to poetry, music, opera etc. *JTQ"
1,A REVIEW OF TILL WE HAVE FACES A MYTH RETOLD,"Sadly , and with great disapointment. If i am honest i will have to say that this is the most boring and awful book i have ever read. Like the last commenter i had to put it down well before the end. the title should read ""a truely boring book""i am an avid reader. I love the classics. but this has nothing in common with the real myth and the book is distressing. i found myself wanting to slash my wrists because it was such an awful and boring hysterical book that never takes off. I kept reading because of the comments of other readers. However i could not carry on and had to put this book down. I dont think i have ever read such a boring and moronic text."
1,Incredible book. Kindle edition has LOTS of typos,I have read many of Lewis' books and this one outdoes the power of Perelandra. other reviews will give you some of that flavor. The content is five stars; the Kindle edition is so sloppily done that it goes past a mere annoyance to sometimes interfering with what CSL was communicating. Needs a proofreader and a re-release available free to previous purchasers (like me).
5,HOLY MOLY!!!!,"I read this book at a time when I was starting to really dislike C.S. Lewis, but when I read this book I fell head over heels in love with him all over again. This book is PERFECT!!!! All the book is terrific but my favorite parts always fill me up with such joy!!! And oh my dear Lord in heaven, the ending!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!! I was just in ecstasy over the end, which was by far the finest and most well-developed conclusion EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Till We Have Faces is a book of such psychological profoundness and depth you could sink into it and never find an end to it's meaning. I'm still not out of it yet and I don't to be."
4,A chameleon (in the best possible sense),"If you've read the reviews, wondered why everyone raves about TILL WE HAVE FACES, stick with the book till Chapter Ten. It's a little sluggish till you reach Chapter Ten, but make no plans once you turn that page. You won't put it down after that point.I am amused, I think, by the rigid assertions of some reviewers, as to what Lewis was trying to say with this tale. If you are put off by any of those assertions, ignore them. Plain and simple, don't listen to what a single person on here says the book means.Because the first time you read it, you'll understand it one way. The next time, after you yourself have grown, changed, aged, oh sigh, yes even matured, you will understand it another way. You will identify with one character more than another depending on who you are and are becoming, you will read the philosophy/theology differently depending on what you believe at that moment.But -- once read, it's likely you will read it again."
2,First-time disappointment,"Up until now, I have never been disappointed in a book by C.S. Lewis: fiction, fantasy, non-fiction-all top-notch, gripping and beautifully told. I found the first person narrative of ""Till We Have Faces"" to be thoroughly unconvincing-it never rang true to me as a story told by a female protagonist. The language seemed unnecessarily stiff, even allowing for the style being imitative of epic prose. I would discourage anyone from reading this book as a first contact with C.S. Lewis (it's probably interesting as an anomaly for readers who are well-acquainted with his work.)"
4,great book!,"This book was great. i read it for a book club and that helped me to understand the meaning of it all, but it was enjoyable to read as well!"
3,"Same Stuff, Different Cover Art","Wasn't this originally realeased as a limited edition called ""The Originals"" in the summer of 1976? Altough this is a great ""starter set"" for new KISS fans, for me personally, I'm bored with all the retro stuff...3 stars..."
4,Great product - customer service not so good.,"Of the 12 lights I bought, one didn't work. I'm still waiting for the company to tell me how to get the broken one replaced. I'll change my rating when that happens."
4,Rechargeable LED light,Find it interesting! 1st night I had it the power went out for a few minutes and the emergency light came on. I am impressed.
1,Great Concept - Lousy Product,"I purchased two of these little lights several months ago. The concept and operation was terrific, but within a week one of the LEDs on one of them went out and then the whole unit started flickering badly. I e-mailed Datexx about a replacement and they have ignored me.I don't recommend this product. Datexx chosing a lousy Chinese manufacturer is a mistake anyone could make, but ignoring a customer with a problem is unforgivable."
4,Easy to work with it!!!,"It is really easy to work with it.You can create and write wherever you want, using the whole space or half of the card.Perhaps it just doesn't have a variety of clip arts available, but a least you can import pictures from anywhere.It works perfect well with Avery cards, you just select the model number and print."
4,Good program with nice graphics,I was able to make some nice business cards using both my own photos and the program's graphics. Labels are nice too. The only problem I had was the program having all the types and styles of cards and labels I could purchase. I struggled a bit figuring out how to print on some sheets. It would have been nice to have better directions or help subjects in order to answer my questions. For the price it is a good program.
2,The price was good but it cost more to ship it that the cost of the item.,I am not satisfied with this product. When i loaded it on my cpu I loaded the label part first. When I attempted to load the print shop portion the program stopped working and locked my computer up. I finally had to unplug the cpu and re-power it up to get it running again. I removed the Printshop version and tried to remove the Label portion but could not. When I tried to do some labels on the program I found it to be more complicated that it should have been. I spoke to a friend and she said she had the same problem with Printshop and it took her son-in-law five days to fix the problem.
2,Basic labels,I purchased this to create labels for gifts. I found it easier to create the labels with the templates that come with the labels (Avery). So I'm not using this product at all.It might be ok for DVD labels. I didn't try that.
5,"I'm no scholar, but this is just lovely!","This was my first experience listening to music from such an early period, and I was spellbound. I'm not qualified tojudge the scholarly accuracy of the performance practices, nor can I compare these to other performances of the same pieces. I can say only that the music has an unearthly beauty of a kind which is not found in later music. The vocal style is different from what we find in baroque, classical and romantic choral pieces. It has a profound purity which comes, at least partly, from an absence of vibrato. There are eight composers represented, among whom Josquin and Palestrina are the best known. (One of the composers is Giacches de Wert, who, contrary to the Amazon listing, is not the conductor! The conductor is Christopher Jackson, and the ensemble is the Montreal Studio of Ancient Music, if I've translated the French correctly.) A beautiful recording. It was my first CD of ""early"" music, but it will not be my last!"
4,The title says it all...,"Truly, the music on this CD must be what heaven sounds like! The ""Tulerunt Dominum Meus"" is outstanding. The only thing that could be added to this CD is a translation from Latin to English. Even so, not knowing the meaning of the words will not keep one from being transported in ecstasy while listening to this gorgeous music."
4,"Beautiful, Unhackneyed Music","The opening Gombert Lament is a stunner, as is everything on this disk. It is recorded in a live, but not muddy, acoustic which really puts a beautiful ""glow"" on the proceedings. This would have gotten 5 stars from me except for the lack of texts and translations."
2,Didn't work for my Tenia Versicolor,It may work for some but not for me. I used this product for about 8 weeks with no results.
4,It works,"I have been using this shampoo soap, along with a coal tar shampoo for the past several years. A dermatologist recommended that the use the ZNP bar and the coal tar shampoo to treat dandruff and an itchy scalp. It works."
5,gone with the flakes!,If you have flakes anywhere on your body znp soap will get rid of them and leave your skin baby soft. I have been using ZNP soap for 30 years and hate to see it unavailable. one bar lasts a very long time. about a year! Please bring the soap back!
4,Got this for school,"I had to get this book for class, not really one of my favorite books, but I did learn a lot and it has helped me both in class and at work. I got it shipped very fast and it came in great condition."
1,The Worst,I hated this AC adaptor so much. It seems like it only works when it wants to. Sometimes it works perfectly but other times it turns on for a second and the turns off. DONT BUY IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY.
4,it's pretty good,it works pretty well if u don't plan on using it for more than a couple months . it BREAKS EASLY . Even if it is turned off during a thunder storm it has a chance of breaking.
5,As expected,I have used the product before and ordered on line for a better price. It arrived in a timely manner as expected.
3,Good but not great,I have previously given The Big Prize and Monsters Under The Bed 5 star reviews by this wonderful band. This one is not as good and they do try and update their sound with mixed results. I understand the need to sound relevant in today's world but If It Ain't Broke Don't Fix It. This band is awesome and the re-release of this CD Dreamland was much better. Check out the above mentioned CD's or the bands 2 CD greatest hits if you want some great rock and roll.
1,Don't bother!,"I love this group's early feel-good canadian rock n' roll, but I stumbled onto this album in a music store in the mall. With excitement, I sampled all the songs and to my disappointment, I still can't figure out what the hit was suppose to be. It's really terrible so don't bother. Just stick to their old stuff. Their 80's stuff rocks!!"
2,Could Be Better,"I think the plot of this movie was the difference between being loving and being selfish in an unberable and confusing situation. The plot and Christian perspective was a bit limited and could have been further developed. There were a few special effects that occured with more frequency as the movie progressed. These were better than I expected, but could have been better. The whole movie seemed a bit amateurish but I appreciated the Christian perspective it portrayed."
4,"Great Episodes, but... lackluster DVD","These episodes are all hilarious. Squidbillies and Aqua Teen Hunger Force are my favorite adult swim shows and I am disappointed that both shows have decided to switch to a single DVD release format as opposed to the 2 disc sets that they had in the past.What does this mean for the buyer?-Less episodes per set this time around-Key special features are missing. There are no commentaries on this 3rd volume. The ""squidbilly circle jerk"" (which was my favorite special feature on the first two volumes) doesnt get another sequel. It just feels like there should have been more features.-The packaging is not as deluxe as it was previously.It still deserves a high rating though because they did manage to pack ALOT of stuff onto one disc, but it is a step backward from the first two volumes."
5,Great!,"Great movie, got to my home very fast, could not be happier with the quality of the DVD as well!"
5,Early is the man...I mean squid,"Really hilarious, but must watch from season 1 to understand all the characters and the point of the show really."
3,Not Season 3,"I love squidbillies, but this is not season 3, this is season 4. Season 3 had 20 episodes while this only has 10. It would get 5 stars but this isn't actually season 3."
3,:(,"Upset this cost the same as the other two seasons that had two discs. The price has gone up on the first two, but they were about $15 when I bought them. The others had cool boxes/artwork, too. Love the Squidbillies, but where I'd give the first two seasons a 5 star. This lack luster dvd gets a 3."
3,Evocative Shakespeare,To your joy you can find beautiful old english songs of he shakespeare era. Nice selection but incompleet. Recomended for those intrested in Shakesperean plays as well.
2,"too bad, it looks like fiona's selling out",i liked her first book witch : a magickal journey alot. she took a chapter out of witch: a magickal journey also titled 7 days to a magickal new you added a few new things and made it into this book. save your money and just get her first book it has the same material as this plus tons more and if you already have her first one don't even bother with this. it's a cute idea but it looks way too much like she was just trying to make a quick buck reproducing old material.
1,I should like it but I don't,"I would like to think that I am always supportive of Australian talent, but in this case I am not. This book is highly impractical in the main. I mean really, who could devote 7 days to working on a magickal new self. It's a lovely idea, but just so self-centred. The amount of money you would have to spend to fossick around for all the bits and pieces she says you need, urgh you'd need a lie down after that. Ok so she sort of redeems herself at the end with a small section on what to do if you don't have the time, but it's a token chapter.The other thing is that most of the text appears to have been borrowed form her other publications, and the picture on the front, whilst very cutesy, she is a pretty lass after all, is a real-turn off to a serious Wiccan practitioner.Sorry Fiona, not a great buy or unique read."
1,What a rip off,"I order alot of merchandise from Amazon. But will have real reservations about doing so again. This product I did not realize was not from Amazon and so difficult to return I said lesson learned and kept it. But I will think long and hard about using Amazon again. This product was marked with a sticker that said $0.75 I was charged $3 something and then $3 something for delivery and that was suppose to be free. So I paid $7 dollars for a $.075 book. Not happy next Christmas I will just hit the stores and remember this expierence. Before I told friends Amozon is great so guick and easy , now I say watch out what you are getting some things are a real rip off."
3,It's a cute book.,"It's a cute book, and I think our little one will like it, but I'm not too crazy about the illustrations. They are very simplistic and not as detailed as I was hoping. It's mostly just pictures of the child, which is fine and helps with the sign language, but the pictures should also help tell the story, such as pictures of the spider being washed out or a water spout... I'm glad to have it and we will surely use it, but I'm not sure I would order any more from the same company/publisher."
5,Skull Bones Watch,My husband absolutely LOVED this watch. He rides a motorcycle and is very much into the skull theme. It works great and it looks awesome on the wrist.
2,no steel toe,These are good enough work shoes but are not steel toe as advertized. DO NOT buy if you need steel toe.
4,Scandinavian Cheese Assortment (2 pound) by igourmet.com,The recipients of the gift of four Scandinavian Cheeses were pleased and offered thanks for the items as well as for the considerate effort.
2,news broardcasting radio or TV,"I am the radio communications broadcast fans, I want to reference or informations about this. If you dont pardon I want the books of reference news broadcaster Radio or TV"
5,Best Banjo,This is one of the best bluegrass CD's out there. It's 7 years old and I continue to listen to it. Scott Vestal produces some of the tastiest banjo I've ever heard(and I've listened to Bela and the rest forever). Each musician is a master on their instruments. The beat is immaculate. I've been a banjo player for over 25 years and this is one of my favorites.
4,Batman Begins,Great Movie! Much more serious and well done than the recent Batman movies. (Except for the first two done by Burton)
2,Poor Streaming,"Movie was great! The Amazon streaming was horrible. Several times the movie would stop to buffer but wouldn't restart on it's own. Several times we had back up and and restart the movie. Picture quality was good but streaming compared to NetFlix, Hulu etc. Amazon has a long ways to go before I'll buy another movie through your system."
4,Good movie,"I watched this movie after watching ""The Dark Knight"" and ""The Dark Knight Rises"" so that may be why I gave it the 4 stars...Personally, I would've loved a bit more action and I'm partial to Katie Holmes as Rachel- I liked Maggie better...And this is super long!! I had to force myself to sit and watch it after the first hour and half lolBut it is a good movie!"
3,Not new,The DVD was not new and had been rewrapped to be given that appearance. Was shipped fast and the DVD does work
3,"Great Movie, but Falsely Advertised","I purchased this Blu-ray movie on my trip back home during the holidays to watch on my PS3 once I had returned. I had specifically picked this movie for two reasons: the first being it is very well written and directed. The second reason being an odd one, but one that is very beneficial to my household: Japanese is offered both in voice and subtitles in the Blu-ray version. My wife being Japanese would be the background behind that choice. I was very dismayed to find out that this is not the case, despite being advertised so. I was able to find every other language except Japanese. Had this been any other customer, I am sure it would not be a big deal. Unfortunately, it being one of the main reasons I purchased it, I will try and get my money back as soon as possible. Despite that drawback, the movie looks wonderful in High Definition."
4,The Truth Behind the Myth,It is exciting to finally reach an understanding of why there is such acharacter called Batman. We are taken into the life and times of BruceWayne whose personal expierences are responsible for his dedication tofight injustice and bring brightness into the lives of people who arebeing preyed upon by unscrupulous villians. This crusading Dark Knight isaided in his quest by his loyal butler Alfred.
3,"Alright Movie, Bad DVD","I thought the movie started out slow with ""Batman"" not showing up to about an hour into the film but all together an alright film. But I am mad as all get out because I bought the widescreen version from Wal-Mart and then came home to find out that it has no special features. I came on here to find out what was up with that and found that Amazon has a 2 disc version for sale that my Wal-Mart didn't have. I just don't understand why they would release a movie on DVD these days without special features. It has become a common thing for every DVD to get special features especially big name movies like this. There should only be 1 version of a new DVD released so that people don't' buy the wrong one by accident like I did. So now I have to go and spend another $20 to get the 2 disc set. Anyone want to buy the regular version for $15 you can get me on Yahoo Messenger. My name is niner4life8."
5,Movie Perfection,"It's rare you find such a treat in the theatres these days. Disappointing acting, unoriginal stories, and recycled plots create a crapfest of bad movies. However, The Dark Knight shows us we don't need to be this way. Heath Ledger, rest his soul, was truly at the top of his game and all the choices were excellent actors. The story line, while obviously somewhat recycled (forgivably so), is as original as its going to get, and the whole movie is carried off without much in the way of flaw. Granted, you can pick things out that are ""wrong"" but all within the realm of suspension of disbelief.In any case, the movie is worth owning just for Ledger's performance!"
4,Great price on a good movie,"I bought this movie for basically the same price it would have cost me to rent it, so I cannot complain. I am not going to offer you a review of the movie, there are better places to find that; I am just going to recommend that, if you like this movie or think you might like this movie at all, it is better to buy it at this price then to rent it for a buck less."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:The best Batman movie yet made (including The Dark Knight), Batman Begins suffers only from a miscast Katie Holmes and an extremely over-the-top Tom Wilkinson as it portrays Bruce Wayne's transformation into Batman about as realistically as possible; a superhero movie for the modern age."
5,BATMAN TRULY BEGINS,"EXCELLENT!!! I wish I could forget all the other Batman movies, even the ones that Tim Burton directed. Although Michelle Pfeifer was pretty hot as Catwoman. If only ALL Super Hero movies were done like this movie. In my opinion this was even better than Spiderman. Even women that I know who don't like super hero movies love, that's right, LOVE, this movie. It is basically a character driven drama with action. And for once, the villains don't upstage the main character as they did with ALL the previous Batman movies. If you are looking for a Super Hero movie that has it all, look no further. THIS IS IT! I can't wait to see the Dark Knight this summer!!!"
4,good batman not great,"what i mean by this batman movie was better than the other twos batman batman 3&4 i think this batman movie is better that following the comics than the 4 batman movies that before it i think as far (micheal keaton,s verison of batman he,s nail ) bale verison not as doesn,t follows the comics and ra,s al Ghul has a pit that makes him young ."
4,Great film ecxept...,The drugs. I mean a Batman movie about drugs. That's all movies are about anymore. Drugs. Can't people come up with something different than drugs. None of the other batman movies were about drugs. Just this one. This was the only flaw of the movie. If the next Batman movie is about drugs in 2008 then I am going to be so mad. Christopher Nolan needs to come up with something other than drugs. And then the train fight. This is pretty much a copy from Spider-Man 2. Correction there are two flaws. Otherwise it had a dark story and great special effects.
1,Problem with 2nd disc,"Like other reviewers, I had the same problem with the second disc. I sent it back not ONCE but TWICE, so in all I tried 3 copies of the movie, and the second disc still would not work on any copy. This movie is great, but DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION, unless you want a DVD that doesn't work. They really need to fix this problem."
3,Did he ever pull out the chainsaw?,"I'm not sure I like Christian Bale as Batman/Bruce Wayne. Everytime I see him, I await for him to pull out a chainsaw and start slicing people. Yes, I'm referring to his role in American Psycho. A role he will never be able to escape, in my opinion. He has looked menacing in everything since that movie. And Batman Begins is no exception.I miss the interpretation of Michael Keaton. Before 1989, no one would have fathomed Keaton as Batman. He was predominately a comedic actor. But he made it work. He was slightly off-kilter and bumbling, but could still kick butt when it was time. He understood the balance and the difference between Bruce Wayne and Batman. Something none of the others could.I'm not going to even comment on them casting Katie Holmes, a girl just barely in her mid-twenties playing a D.A. We seem to be witnessing the same problem in the latest Superman movie with Lois Lane. Hollywood, there are women in their thirties around."
2,Great movie but no bonus features on this version,"I liked this movie and I'm a big fan of widescreen, but I was very dissapointed that this version did not contain any bonus features, except for a theatrical trailer. No ""making of"", no actor bio's, no commentaries, etc. Also, this version does not contain a scene index. The only inserts are a symantec software rebate coupon and a Batman collection catalog. Very cheap packaging. I'm surprised the case was plastic instead of cardboard!"
2,Boring,"I dont know why people like this movie so much. It takes forever to get going. I know it has to setup a backstory but its still really boring. Doesnt even feel like a batman movie.It barely shows the villians. Way to much dialogue and not much action. Even the batmobile scene through the city isnt exciting. It goes like 25 mph. The blu-ray pic quality is not top of the line stuff compared to the best. I looks kinda like a upconverted dvd. Watch the preview of the dark knight on the disc and you will instantly see the difference. Also the ""League of Shadows"" storyline is laughable. Haveing just seen The Dark Knight a few days ago, i can say that it easily a 5 star movie. It starts right up and it entertaining throughout. 2 stars is for the movie not the bluray"
3,does anybody else remember when you could read a whole comic book cover-to-cover in under a half hour?,"while its a cut above the val kilmer or george clooney movies, i still found myself watching this and thinking ""show me something new"" -- & i am not referring to special effects. christian bale holds promise, but so help me: why do these filmmakers always think they need 2 & 1/2 hours to tell a 1 & 1/2 hour story?"
2,Did we see the same movie?,"I couldn't wait to see this movie because of so many good reviews. But .... Without having read the reviews or other synopsis', I wouldn't have had a clue what was happening in the movie. There were so many flashbacks in the middle of scenes you never knew where you were. I like Christian Bale,but his fine acting was lost in the fancy editing. And as for Katie Holmes, her acting was like a piece of cardboard. Thank goodness someone loaned me the movie and I didn't have to pay for it. What a disappointment. Sorry, because I know the other reviews are great, but you must have been watching another movie."
4,"The Dark Side of the one they call, ""Batman"" A new side of the Bat Critter!","I watch the movie on Standard, but I finally watch the HD DVD version. Although the movie was ""Ok to par,"" the HD version is awesome and at times it is brilliant, yet at times it was just ""OK,"" I have it for my HD Collection but it doesn't top some other HD DVD movies (Seasbicuit or Phantom of the Opra). I love the dark side of Batman and that made this movie a little better than a playful hero. I'm happy with the purchase and its a good collection for your HD's."
5,Great Flick,Where it all began. Amazing movie with a great two movies following. The last movie (Dark Knight Rises) relates back to this movie a couple times so good idea to see this one first.
5,This is how you start things off,What can I say that hasn't been said. This first movie of the trilogy is great. Great effort was made to really explore the Batman psyche. They explore what and how does a man become Batman. I don't think you saw Bruce Wayne in the Batman costume in the first 30 minutes of the movie. This more than made up for the previous Batman movies. As a Dark Knight fan I loved this movie.
5,good movie,if you love batman then you will love this movie! we did for sure. it was awesome and we will keep watching it over and over!
5,Batman,This was a gift. The person who received it just loved it. Great detail due to the blue ray. A must see for Batman fans.
3,Great production almost saves bad movie,"Bonus star for great production.The movie itself is slow, boring, cliched and beyond ridiculous. I couldn't wait for it to end."
4,Great Movie,This movie arrived within a couple of days. Very good packaging.I am very pleased with the order I placed. Thanks so much!
5,"Love this move, the HD is awsome",Would have paid even more for this as I love the new batman series. The HD is very nice and I watch it repeatedly.
1,Abundatrade ripped me off,Right in the middle of the Batman Begins DVD I received from AbundaTrade the movie froze and wouldn't pick up again until 2 or 3 scenes before the end of the movie. I will never purchase anything from AbundaTrade ever again.
1,"Senseless violence, bad dialogue.",After the first 30 minutes of senseless violence and stilted dialogue I could not bear to watch the rest of this film.
1,shockingly bad,"i would never have imagined in a million years with all the supposed tlc focused on this flick, that it could have been this poor. it's outrageously bad. the plot...wait what plot? when you see ninjas jumping around closing ranks on bruce, and if you don't fall asleep after the first hour or so...you'll get to 'enjoy' the same disjointed plotless cra#$est that i unfortunately paid to see.AVOID"
4,Great conclusion to a great series,"A great conclusion to a great series. If you enjoyed the first two films in the series, this a must-watch."
3,Average Introduction,"Of the three latest Batman flicks, this one is probably the most visually interesting. However, it lacks the ""comic-booky"" feeling (good examples are Superman and The Crow) that I prefer in movies of this genre. The acting is not terrible, but Mr. Nolan needs to find stronger female leads. Overall, it was entertaining, but I won't be watching it a second time."
4,Batman Begins Takes Me Back to the Beginning,"Reminds me of the first edition Batman Comics which I think I read in 1938. If not - that's close. Christian Bales is very good as a sometimes bumbling, sometimes over wrought emotional character out to revenge his parents' untimely deaths. Learning how to be a caped crusader and implementing the many tools on his belt to do battle against evil was something that should have been revealed in other Batman feature films. Michael Caine plays Alfred very well. I first saw this movie on TCM or AMC. Liked it well enough to add to my DVD collection."
4,"""Good Batman Film!""","Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldmanand Morgan Freeman star in this 2005 action film basedon the comics. After his parents are murdered, BruceWayne becomes a vigilante hero of Gotham City. I likehow this went back to the dark roots and Christian isgood in it. This dvd set has nice picture and soundplus neat extras. I recommend this good Batman film."
5,Great entertinment,Wonderfully entertaining. Nothing that will stay with you forever like with Lost or Battlestar Galactica but worth the price of a rental. Katie Holmes is particularly good in this.
4,upgraded Batman,this is a good movie of how Batman got started and in this day an age of technology and how he learned how to fight and fight an group of people that think the city needs to die.
3,"""Limited Edition Gift Set"" Ain't Worth It.","Of course, this review refers to the regular DVD edition, as the BD gift set of the film is apparently loaded with goodies. As it is, the only thing THIS one is good for is, once you remove all the postcards and zip drive (nice that I now finally have one, but what the heck is it doing in this?!), you can use the box to hold both the two-disc ""Batman Begins"" DVD and the two-disc ""Batman: Gotham Knight"" DVD. The latter is more of a special feature-style thing, anyway, rather than a real stand-on-its-own feature."
5,Best Batman since the original.,"Thankfully the terrible Batman movie streak has come to an end. I wish to ignore every Batman movie since Batman and Batman Returns. As far as I'm concerned those original 2 and this version are the only ones worth watching. Bale is the best Batman, with all due respect to Keaton."
4,chaosprincess,Christian Bale IS BATMAN I think he was the best to have played the super hero of the past. I think after the orginal Batman the others were poorly written and somewhat of a bore. I mean Val Kilmer and George Clooney there talants are best used in other films such aa Val Kilmer's performance in THE DOORS which he was incrediable in. Lets face it girls would you just love to see George Clooney in those scrubs playing the ever so sexy and slighty turlmoulus Doug Ross on ER. Bale gives something to the charcter that the other actors have not been able to do creditability and mystery.
5,better than war of the worlds,This is the best movie so far of 05. With dissapointments to both star wars and war of the worlds I decided to go and see this. I was impressed in this movie. You get more of the story of bruce wayne training and learning to be a better fighter to then become the dark night. And don't listen to these other people because this movie is not boring. This has a story and it has great action. If you want to see a gret movie than go see this movie. Or if you want to see crap then listen to the nay sayers and watch fantastic four. But you won't regret watching this movie.
3,"Entertaining, BUT an average action-movie...","...where all's been done and seen before, so where all the ""Best movie ever!"" or ""Fantastic!"" comes from, well -personally I have absolutely no idea. It's a good movie, it's mindless fun -fantasy, and that's all. The beginning of the movie reminded me instantly of ""Highlander"" (the first one of those), the rest of it could have been inspired by a thousand other ""dark"" action-movies (""The Crow"" as an example). So take it easy now, Batman-maniacs. Bale is a good actor, and ""suits"" his part -Oldman sadly wastes his talent (my favorite actor), the same goes for Freeman and Caine. No disaster, but nothing remembarable here. I couldn't help feeling that the script was missing something. And from the beginning it is in such a hurry, and at the same time this is quite a long movie. Not a good combination. In other words; Highly overrated, but entertaining. And worth seeing. I'd rent before buying though."
5,Sweet!,I honestly expected less when I wathced this movie. Best Batman ever....loved the Scarecrow and the plot. Renting the rest of the trilogy tonight!
4,Good Batman movie,"The movie seemed dark at first; but has a good storyline, kept me on the edge of my seat and Christopher is so good looking!"
1,It sucked go see War of the Worlds instead.,A lot of people told me that Batman Begins was good but I didn't like it. The first hour was too long and slow without Batman and it was all about Bruce Wayne training to becoming Batman and Batman did not show till the last hour. I'm not really a big fan of Liam Neeson though he's boring but what's really the point of this Batman movie there's nothing exciting about it. It really wasn't surprising to me. Christian Bale did make an excellent Batman and his voice really fitted as Batman but the whole movie was just not good. Wait for the DVD don't see it in theater. That's all I have to say. I thought War of the Worlds was better than Batman. Batman Begins really sucked.
1,I'm astounded,"at the ratings. This is one of the worst films I have ever seen! Terrible acting, storyline and special effects! I actually threw it out. It makes Kilmer's/Clooney's versions look good and Keaton's looks like masterpieces!"
1,A Bore,"I watched this movie when it first came out and thought it was really boring and disappointing. I generally like Katie Holmes and think she was fine in the movie, but Christian Bale was lousy and so was the plot and direction of this movie. If you just want to see a series of technical movie stunts followed by a few mildly romantic scenes surrounding a plethora of neurotic, self-absorbed dialogue, psychosis, and horrible directing, then you might be interested in watching this movie."
3,I like my Superheroes Comic Bookie,"I like my Superhero movies to be just like the Comic Book, so I'll tell Christian Bale the same thing I told Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer and George Clooney---> You Sir are no Adam West!!! ha ha"
2,what!,"It thought this movie was going to be cool,but the beggining was so boring i fell assleep! But the end was cool."
1,Am I the only one?,"Am I the only one who didn't like this movie? Why this was so critically accliamed is beyond me. It was all...bleh. The action, the characters, the acting, the dialouge......it was all bleh. Sure, it may be the best Batman movie, but that's not saying much at all. The talk was that this was going to be a dark and realistic movie. I just saw it as another silly superhero fare. I guess I just don't like superheroes. If you want an interesting and dark action flick, check out the Bourne series. Batman is just for little kids and comic book fans."
5,"nice movie, especially compared to the ones from the 90s","i mean even with an all star cast they turned out to be a joke. This is how batman was supposed to be interpreted, i know there are many sagas of the comics, but the newer ones all have a darker theme to them."
5,Great fun!,Had not seen these so got them to watch on a long flight. Enjoyed the flight even though I had to sit in the middle of a row.
5,amazing movie,"Great movie composed of an amazing story and good acting. Batman Begins is one of the best Batman movies up to its release and is followed by an equally enjoyable film, Dark Knight."
3,Technical errors,"The movie was awesome. I definately recommend the movie, but be wary of the 2 disc set. I had the same problem another reviewer had; the special features disc does nothing. It comes up with the WB logo, and some other legal jargon and then nothing. i have tried it on my DVD player, and two computers. even upon returning it for another copy, the second disc refuses to play.the movie really is great though, and this review is only a concern about the features disc technical errors. =^.^="
5,Batman Lives!!,Damn good movie with a great cast. Christina Bale IS Batman and Gary Oldman (I am a HUGE fan) breathes life into the Commissioner Gordon character. I can not wait for the sequel!
4,Excellent Movie,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Great effects, very good plot line... well worth the money and a good change from the previous Batman titles (which, I thought were very good -- hey, it's from a COMIC BOOK)!"
3,Batman Begins,"This first of the Batman Trilogy is the weakest in terms of performance & story however, I recommend watching this in order to get to the third & final of the series. They simply get better, improving in the actors cast, performance & story. It comes together perfectly. Go ahead watch all three back to back, we loved it."
4,Christian Bale is such a hottie.,"Since the final movie in the Dark Knight trilogy came out not too long ago, I decided to get myself up to speed on what had happened so far before its release. And boy am I glad I did. Christian Bale is HOT and I loved seeing him put through his paces."
2,good movie awful product,i love this movie my problem is with the quality of the product the case is useless and doesnt hold the disk in place this led to the disk freely thumping around while it was being shipped and is scratched all over it looks like its been used.
5,My Blu-ray discs collection begins with this.,A great Blu-ray disc with which to start a new Blu-ray disc collection. Can't wait to see the Black Knight when it comes out later (probably around X-mas).
5,The best Batman yet.,"To date, this is the best Matman movie yet. I must admit, I was a bit apprehensive since the Batman movies of the past seemed plain out cheesy, however, Batman Begins proved to be the exact opposite or it's predecessors. Starring Christian Bale, Batman Begins is more ""true-to-life"" than the one's of the past and emits a dark, goth, atmosphere. More Underworld-like (the movie). You have to see this for yourself."
3,Good movie but... Katie Holmes was definitely a wrong choice.,"My wife and I really enjoyed this movie. It was everything it was cracked up to be. Good effects, good action... It would have been a great movie had it not been for an insipid performance by Katie Holmes. There are countless other female actresses that could have played that role better. (why oh why?) Try as we did to suspend disbelief and give her a chance to play her character in the dramatic scenes... we never were able to get over the eerie feeling that Dawson's creek made it somehow into the script. She's just not ready for the big screen... Perhaps a few more films might do it. It's a sad case as I would have probably bought this film had it not been for her lackluster performance. On a more positive note... All the other characters and actors were superb."
5,I'll try to keep it short,"Ok, here it is in a nutshell, this is almost like a watching a Batman documentary, no over the top villians, no goofy sidekicks, just the complete origin of Batman. Very good acting and well paced, this movie is the polar opposite of Batman & Robyn."
5,"Fun, well directed Batman film","What a great cast... Christian Bale, Tom Wilkinson, Cilian Murphy, Liam Neeson, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and the greatest living actor today... Gary Oldman. What more could you ask for?This movie introduces the beginning of Batman, as well as introduce two new villains from the Batman live-action franchise - Scarecrow and Ra's al Ghul. It has a wonderful mix of comedy, drama, and action, as well as a very nice ending. Gotham never looked as beautifully depicted as Nolan has done. You won't be disappointed with this movie."
5,Incredible,"Absolutly incredible, Batman Begins is one of the best films ever. Placed upon the shoulders of Blue-Ray, Batman Begins is even better with incredible sound and amazing picture quality."
5,Well worth a better version,I already had a regular version of this great film but is was well worth the expense of buying a blu ray version. The excellent quality of the rich colors and super sharpness of the blu ray version was worth the expense. I would recommend this blu-ray disc.
2,Ninja Batman????,"Bruce Wayne trained as a ninja? He could single-handedly defeat all the other ninjas, including his mentors? He got all his weapons and gadgets from an inventor in his late father's company? Where did he park his batmobile when he was fighting thugs and rescuing his girlfriend? How did he drive the batmobile there without being noticed in the first place? The ninjas were going to kill him, but when the giant beam fell on him, they just left him alone, to be rescued by the butler???They tried to fit all the pieces in, but ended up leaving too many holes."
2,GOOD FILMS DON'Y CANCEL OUT OTHERS!,"THIS FILM IS UTTERLY TERRIBLE IN THE WAY THAT IT CANCELS OUT THE ORIGINAL BATMAN MOVIE AND BATMAN RETURNS. TURNS OUT JACK NAPPIER DIDNT KILL BRUCE WAYNE'S PARENTS, IT WAS SOME OTHER BLOKE. THAT IS THE MAIN THING THAT BOTHERED ME ABOUT THIS FILM. ALSO AT THE END THE JOKER SEEMS TO BE HANDIN OUT CARDS. DONT THINK SO. NAPPIER FELL INTO A BOWL OF ACID AND TURNED INTO THE JOKER. HE ISNT THE SORT OF GUY TO GO THROWIN JOKER CARDS ABOUT. VERY STUPID. BATMAN AND BATMAN RETURNS ARE THE BEST BATMAN FILMS MADE. KEATON MUST BE OUTRAGED CUS I WOULD BE IF I WAS HIM!"
2,Blank- Man Begins,"Batman Begins would've been a better movie had it been it's own original character. Although comical at times and the constant changing lead actors playing Batman (i.e. Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer & George Clooney), the consistency was there. Batman Begins and doesn't quite offer an insight as to what you're watching. Is he in Tibet? Okay, halfway in you find out why he was locked up. Batman Begins tried to be darker than it was. The unimpressive BatMobile (Hummer, dune buggie dragster fusion). Maybe the new generation of kids will enjoy this. But as a new twist on Batman, 2 stars. As a standalone hero, Begins would deserve maybe 4 stars."
1,CRUMMIEST I EVER SAW,THIS MOVIE SUCKED BALE SOUNDS LIKE FROGGY OF OUR GANG AS BATMAN - FIGHT SCENES SOLID CRAP - BALE HORRIBLE BATMAN - WORST I EVER SAW - IF I COULD GIVE IT A MOON INSREAD OF ONE STAR I WOULD MOON IT!!!!
1,BORING BORING BORING,"BORING,IT'S ALREADY BEEN ON FOR AN HOUR AND NOTHINGS HAPPENED,I'VE HAD TO STOP EVERY 5 MINUTES BECAUSE I'VE BEEN SO BORED,THE ORIGINAL SERIES WAS SO LIGHT & FUN..THIS IS PAINFUL."
1,Don't Waste Your Money or Your Time!,"Boring, dragged out, thought it would never end! This movie is terrible!!!!! NOT fun like the other Batman movies!!!!!"
3,I love this movie but,"If you already have the actual movie then the gift set is not worth the money. it comes with a bunch of extra cardboard, a USB, a dark knight sneak peek disc(which is really just the latest trailer) and all the same features that are on the double disk version. I'm sorry i pre ordered it. That was the third time I bought this movie.however if you haven't see the movie then absolutely buy this!"
5,A comment about the fight scenes,"Pretty much everything has already been said about this fantastic movie, which raised the comic book adaptation bar well beyond X-Men, or even Spiderman, has been said; so there is little to add.I noticed a lot of people complain about the fight scenes. They are quick, confusing and chaotic. This is EXACTLY like it is having a bunch of bats swarm by.That is the intent of the fight scenes and it is very accurate.Other then that the major complaint is that this is not a brain dead movie. There are plenty of movies to keep the mouth breathing, knuckle-dragging Budweiser crowd happy. Not every movie needs to be mindless. Go watch Die Hard or something."
5,great action movie,"I loved it, the action was great . And it kept you going all the way.You should really buy this movie .It is very good."
4,"Good, but...","This sure was a good movie, but Michael Keaton still makes a better Batman. Everyone else is just an immitation of Michael Keaton's Batman role."
4,Made me a Christian Bale fan,This movie made me a Christian Bale fan. He is a fantastic actor and will someday be recognized as great. The special effects are super and the story shows how a person of wealth can be socially valuable. That is a nice twist or departure from demonizing those who were born into wealth.
4,"Cool movie but NOT ""THE BEST EVER""","I know you recent movie goers have just come out of the theatre recently. I did too. We're charged up but don't get out of control. Get a Bat-grip on yourself. The BEST Batman movie was the 1989 Tim Burton original. Batman Returns comes next and Batman Begins is somewhere around there. The Schumacher ones,while not being superb, still have their moments.The Batsuit did make Bale look sometimes like FATman. The Batarangs were rusty looking and not cool enough. I like the action sequences and how the story circled on fear. The early training stuff seemed to go a little too fast.All in all, Batman Begins is a good movie. I just think people need to think twice before they label Bale better than Keaton. HEEEELLL NOO!!! :O"
3,Average,"""Batman Returns"" may satisfy aficionados, but it it won't create converts. As a comic book adaptation, it is average. Those who are not particularly enthusiastic about the genre will most likely just watch as the movie goes by, unwilling to be fully drawn in to the fantasy universe of Gotham City in ""Batman Begins"".The special effects are decent and the City looks real. The acting, however, particularly on the part of Christian Bale, is near non-existent. As for the training sequences, the story is bland, stale and sometimes unexplained. The fight choreography fails to impress, as the editing is too heavy-handed.Unlike the rest of the Batman series the script of ""Begins"" tells the story of Batman as a boy. The story of Boy Bruce Wayne is in line with the movie as a whole, as it is interesting in some some regards and unconvincing in many others."
4,Love it love it!,"What a great start to a hopeful new trilogy. It was a little long, but easily the smartest of all the batman films today. I very much look forward to the next one."
4,Really good Nolan re-boot,"Batman Begins was a really good film.It gave us a good look on how Bruce Wayne became Batman.Nolan brought back the darker Batman that we all loved from the comics,along with a few new villains which we've never seen in a Batman film,before this one.I was really happy how Christian Bale played Bruce Wayne/Batman.He brought back that seriousness to the role that Michael Keaton had.I thought Ra's al Ghul was a great villain.It was kind of a letdown though,because we did not see much of him in the middle of the movie.Just at the beginning and more at the end.I was not very happy with Johnathan Crane/Scarecrow.I didin't think that a guy putting a potato sack over his head and gassing people was very scary at all.Overall though.This is still a great film and I highly recommend it,if you've never seen it."
3,"May be my Blu-Ray player, but...","...I did everything I could to get the latest software updates to my BDP-S1 Blu Ray player in preparation for this disk. By the time I did all the updates I had the very latest software right off of Sony's website. It looked great once I finally got it playing (which took 3 or 4 attempts for some reason - again may have been my player). However, I had to watch the entire movie before finally seeing the DVD menu with the extra features. I really wanted to watch the Dark Knight movie preview right away so that bummed me out. Also, once you finally do get to it, the menu looks very hastily put together. It just had a very rushed, ""beta"" edition feel to it. Normally I really don't care about the bells and whistles on DVDs, but I had an exceptionally difficult time dealing with this disk, which is a bummer because this is one of my all time favorite movies."
4,Good movie,Good movie. The first obscure movie of batman. It really makes more credible the hole batman story. Need to be seen in blu ray.
5,Batman is da Bomb!,"What can I say, Christian Bale is the best Batman yet! Remember when Clooney tried it?Hah! Buy this DVD here and save some bucks!"
5,Great BlueRay,The blue ray is great and the added comic inside is cool. Great first movie of the series. I have The Dark Knight and obviously awaiting the 3rd
5,Batman Begins,The Dark Knight Series is by far the best Superhero movies I have ever seen!!!! Loved every minute of it!
3,Good but no captions,Good movie and good quality. Unfortunately subtitles and close captions were unavailable and that made it very difficult for my husband to follow the plot.
5,good storyline,"This is not just an action movie, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the story was interesting and kept you watching."
4,Exciting to watch!,One of the more attention holding movies that I have recently watched that it made me watch the next in the trilogy.
3,Bat Man,A great movie. A great way to begin the trilogy. I perfer this movie ove the dark knight rises. However it wasn't perfect.
2,BATMAN BEGINS blue-ray DVD (SPECIAL FEATURES),"The movie is great, that's why i bought the movie, but i also wanted to see all the special features, that's the reason i bought it a blue-ray dvd for this movie.Unfortunately a lot of these special features are not working. They appear in the special features menu screen, but when i press their link, the dvd tries to load the segment, but then it returns to the disc menu screen with out showing the short. It happens with the following special features: Batman-The Journey Begins, Shaping Mind and Body, Gotham City Rises, Cape and Cowl, Batman-The Tumbler, Path to Discovery, Saving Gotham City. Other features such as The Dark Knight IMAX Prologue, Digital Batman work fine.It is a shame that most of the special features do not work, i am dissappointed with the quality of this product."
4,Classic Batman adventure,Classic Batman adventure that delivers with style. Now we can watch the Dark Knight next. We enjoyed it even when we were home sick.Good Job!
4,Batman Begins,Great Beginning to a Trilogy!! Recommend to others to watch the trilogy of Batman. Comes full circle when you see the 3rd Batman movie.
5,I love this movie,"The new Batman movies are awesome. I love Batman, I hope they come out with a third movie soon."
5,Thanks Nolan,"Terrific introduction to the Dark Knight legend. This movie and its sequel assured that Mr Chris Nolan did the best job ever with the caped crusader movies. I already own it in DVD but had to buy the BD version. Specially with a less than $10 price, it is a MUST buy."
5,Great!,Great Movie and great quality dvd! It fit nicely into my collection. I can't wait for the next one to hit theaters!
5,Movie more true to the comics,"finally, a batman movie true to the comics.i didn't like the 4 previous batman movies but i loved this movie!! i'm picky when it comes to batman but this one remains true to the character. i have the deluxe edition dvd and its great.highly recommended for ""real"" batman fans."
4,Best Batman Film,"This is the best version of Batman to ever hit the screen. It beat Tim Burton's 1989 version all to pieces and back again. It is dark, stylish, and true enough to the comics to make die hards happy without alienating moviegoers who are not up to speed on the comics. Think of it as a wink wink, nudge nudge by use of character names only comic readerswould know.The cast is absolutely superb. Christian Bale brings just the right amount of tormented soul to Bruce Wayne, Michael Caine is perfect as Alfred, and Katie Holmes is as pretty as always. Add in the usual fantastic performances by Morgan Freeman and Liam Neesom, and you have the best comic book based film ever.Please suppot this film so we can get bigger and better movies featuring comic book characters."
5,Christian Bale as Batman,This is by far the best Batman series I have seen. It is closer to the dark comics I read as a child and I am looking forward to the second movie The Dark Knight.
5,I'm so funkin' excited about this flick I wrote a song 4 it!,Here's the link---> audiostreet.net/phatsk8traxjentaki76The song is called BATMAN BEGINS (2 get FUNKED UP!)Check it out & holla back with any comments!This flick is going 2 be awesome!
2,Movie was great but Amazon's streaming on my ROKU was so poor it was hard to watch,The streaming was so poor I eventually gave up and searched for the movie on my Verizon FIOS where I watched the last 30 minutes on TNT (with commercials) where it was also playing.
4,A Great look at the Origins of Batman,I purchased this movie a few weeks before the Dark Knight debuted in theaters. I give it a 4/5 star only because there are almost no bonus features whatsoever on this disc. It is the movie only. Otherwise this is an excellent film for any comic book or batman fan.
5,Batman Begins,This was one of the greatest batman movies i ever seen prior to the dark knight. At first I did not think I was going to like it. I mean afterall I always thought no one can do batman as good as Micheal Keaton. Christian Bale proved it he can do batman in his own way. I reccomend everyone to watch this and the sequel to it The Dark Knight.
5,Great Beginning,This is a great transfer. And the 5 minute prologue gives you a sweet taste of how great The Dark Knight will look on Blu ray.
5,The Dark Knight Returns,"This is the Batman movie I've been waiting for! Tim Burton's Batman was my favorite until now. The storyline, the action, the sets, acting, this movie surpassed all of the previous batman movies, especially the most recent Joel Schumacher ones which were horrible. The actors picked for Batman and Ras Al Ghul were perfect, as was Scarecrow. This movie is true to the comic book, thankfully, showing it was NOT the Joker who killed Bruce Wayne's parents. It has that mood you must have for a Batman flick, without a type of pseudo-universe created for him like the Tim Burton movies. Too bad Halle Berry didn't wait for this film to become Catwoman. A better director and costume would have made her the ultimate Catwoman.Finally, a director that doesn't base his movie on the campy 60's tv series. I'm already waiting for the sequel."
1,BATMAN BEGINS (2-Disc Deluxe Edition),I was suprise to recieve both dvds being DISC 1 - Feature Film & no Special Features.Your FEEDBACK features did not have any column with product defect !
2,Batman begins bites,"Once again, way way way overhyped! I really expected this to be the best Batman movie yet. OMG was I wrong! I had to fight to stay awake through the first hour, it was so boring. I think Christian Bale sucked as Batman. It's hard to even express how stupid the Batmobile looked! And what was with Batman talking like dirty Harry? The best parts of this movie, were shown on the commercials. If Christian Bale plays Batman in the sequel, at least I'll know not to waste any money seeing it."
1,Terrible quality streaming video!!,"Don't waste your time or money. The movie quality is very fuzzy, that is, when it does play because it buffers and stops constantly. I have a cable modem and do not have this problem with YouTube or Netflix. I reported this problem to Amazon and they gave me a $5.00 credit, but that was over a year ago and the problem is still there. I'm going out to get the DVD of this now."
2,It kind of sucked!,Sorry Batman fans but I didn't like the movie much because it didn't show Batman till the last hour. I wanted to like it I really did but how can you people sit through and watch the first hour without Batman? The last hour was great but the first hour to me was kind of slow. I was about to get up and go home because the first hour was really boring and no Batman because it only showed Bruce Wayne being trained to be Batman. Christian Bale made an excellent Bruce Wayne and his voice fit the part as Batman but the beginning was too long and I really wanted to see Batman to show up but he didn't till the last hour. I liked the original Batman movies better but Batman Begins sucks.
5,batman as nature intended,"gone are the campy over the top villans of the last movie series. no adam west silliness either. here we have a story in which we can suspend our disbelief and actually get into the character of bruce wayne/batman. the previous celluloid batmen were little more than cardboard cutouts, but this one lives and breathes. i was a bit skeptical about the new batmobile design but after seeing it in action i am now a believer. i hope this is the beginning of a long and fruitful franchise for the venerable dark knight. the bonus features on the second disk were informative and enjoyable with several mini-documentaries about set and costume design, action sequences, and a very nice segment about the comic writers and artists that were the most inspirational for this film. the bonus comic is also a nice addition to the package."
3,Keep Makin'em Super heroes movies,"When we say we had enough of super heroes movies, here comes ""Batman Begins', to change our minds .Good script, a story well known ,Very good acting by Chritian BAle ."
3,Interesting but Bad Acting at Times,"Batman Begins is an interesting look at the formation of Batman but some things about the movie is bothersome. Overall I'd say Christian Bale does a pretty good job of portraying Batman but his dialogue delivery is just horrendous at times. The worst occurence of this was when he interrogates that guy on the rooftops and hes all pouting trying to look real mean but just looks ridiculous. And the way he asks him the questions is pathetic in that deep grawl like ""Whooooo""...""Wheeere"" its just pretty bad. That scene alone damn near ruined the entire movie for me. And then Katie Holmes is just crap her role is completely forgettable. I think they probably chose her for this role since she has that innocent look about her which would fit with the character who is idealist and pure despite all the corruption of the city but shes just terrible."
2,I'm not sure why this movie got good reviews,"I'm not sure why this movie has gotten good reviews. It was not good. The dialog was awful, the plot ridiculous (we have to destroy it in order to save it). I wish Liam would stop taking on mentor roles.The final scene was physically impossible (swinging under the train as it was moving. just ask yourself how he swung past the pylons that held the rail up)"
3,Batman Should End,This better be the last Batman movie they ever make. Their have already been four Batman movies and now a fifth on when will Hollywood make something orginal. To me Batman is going out of style and nobody watches the cartoon show on the WB. Morgan Freeman is in this movie I think he is good actor. I saw previews advertised on TV it looks good but enough. A horses breathes fire in theis movie.
3,Too long,This movie was geared for the teen crowd. Plot was ok but drawn out. This movie could have been made it half the time and been a much better movie. Way too many fight and chase sceens and too much filler (less is more in some cases). Did they pay the director by the minute? It's an ok movie but if you want a deep or intellegent movie this is't it.
4,"Incredible film, above average blu-ray","Batman Begins is an all time favorite of mine and one I wanted to have on blu-ray. The transfer is excellent. At 1080p at 73"" (Mitsubishi 2008 DLP) the picuture is stunning. No macroblocking in fast scenes (like in the DVD release). Audio sounds amazing in 7.1.However the extras are a bit slim."
4,Great but not that great...,"Batman begins is a great movie, there is no doubt about that as I'm sure you all know. That's just it though.. its the only thing great about this set. The postcard picture's are nice but whatever you know? And the comic is alright but it doesn't really have any of the character's you wanna see, it's just the bank job from The Dark Knight so it's no big deal. In the end I can only recommend this movie the the truly HARD CORE hard core fans of the new batman movie's. For me (a fan of batman but not a hard core fanatic) just the blu-ray it's self would have been a better buy."
5,Tied for best movie,"This is my favorite movie with Star Wars Episode IV Return of the Jedi. It's a dark movie and a tiny bit scary,but it's still great! In the end Batman fights the Ducard in a great battle on the train. It's a great movie!"
4,Dark and entertaining,"Darkness, evil, and corruption...thats what you'll get when you watch this movie. But for all the turmoil in Gotham, there is one beacon of hope, though this beacon is quite dark himself. Bruce Wayne, played by the talented Christian Bale, is Batman, a hero for the people w/ his own set of problems...dating back to his parents murder when he was just a boy. Throughout the movie he tries to deal with these issues while saving Gotham from ""the bad guy.""The special effects in this movie are incredible. Plus the batmobile just kicks a**. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone looking for some dark, moody entertainment."
4,A Serious Batman,"Batman Has always been one of my favorite comic heroes. This movie departs from the somewhat whimsical, goofyfied villans of the last few installments and returns to a more serious feel. It explores how Bruce Wayne evolves into Batman from his Ninja like training to his cool gear.His mentor becomes his nemesis in a great finale. This is a really cool movie. I am an amature film maker so the ""making of"" features on the dvd are a real education. My only critique is that some of the fight scenes are shot so in tight that you don't get a good look at the action."
4,Batman Begins well!!!,"It's no Dark Knight, but then again, what is...anyway, still better than all the ""original"" Batman movies. At least the quality of the video is great."
5,Batman Belongs,Great addition to my DVD collection. Shipped fast and was in perfect condition when it arrived.
5,Excellent,"The film is wonderfully written and beautifully shot. Nolan is perfect in the Bruce Wayne/Batman role. He plays the irresponisble playboy well, and is very credible as the fighting machine known as Batman. The movie takes its' time getting him into the Batman suit. A friend of mine who was watching the film with me and not that familar with the comics thought it dragged a bit in the beginning. I have to disagree, but I have read Batman comics since I was 7. This version of Batman seems more alone the lines of the Frank Miller version of the character. A bit on the darker side, it is a more believeable hero for our current world. This is a great character piece as well as a terrific action film. Worth picking up."
5,Forget what you know...,"If you've seen the first 4 films in the Batman series and go see ""Begins"" expecting for it to expand on what you already know, you're in for some disappointment. If you're a fan of the animated series, before Robin/Nightwing and Batgirl of course, this is for you. Batman is dark, mysterious, and drives a car that looks like a Lamborghini and a tank's love child.I'm looking forward to the next movie in this revamped series. This is how it should've started 15 years ago, except Christian Bale was probably still in elementary school back then. I hear he's also interested in sequels, so keep it coming!"
4,Buy it!,"Don't expect any bat junk like ""shark repellant"" in this one. It's darker than Tim Burton's and it complexly makes you forget about all the other modern incarnations of PG rated goffery. This film has a great build up and a great explanation of things. Bruce works hard and fails continually, we get to see him develop and suffer and most importantly we get a great new Bat Mobile.The only problem I had with this film is that the scarecrow just seems unnecessary. The movie worked so hard to present a new kind of realism that seems detracted from one that stupid mask appears. Henri Ducard was a good enough villain and the scarecrow just seemed to get in the way.Still all in all, this is a great picture - one that you can easily watch over and over."
5,This one should be off the heazes!!!!!!!!!!,"Batman and Batman Returns rocked solid and Batman Forever and Batman & Robin ah, they're crap. This one should be the best yet! The first time I saw a prievew for it ah, it was ok. But when I saw a 2nd I was freaken excited! But my main question is... WHO WILL BE THE VILLAIN? IT BETTER BE JOKER OR ELSE I'M GONNA CRY(I'm joking)!!!"
5,"it's better than batman,returns,robin,forever!!","but i think if you want dark,scary,violent get this one but i like fantastic four too but maybe they're just if you're in the mood for the OPPOSITE ok? so it's excellent and i like this but i like fantastic four too!!"
4,"Good, but I'm confused","I did like this Batman movie a lot! I now own all of them (except for the Adam West movie). But there are a few holes in the story that left me wondering.In this first movie, Bruce's parents are killed by the Joker, that's why he wants Joker dead! But in this movie, they are killed by someone else completely.The story keeps changing about how he fell into the bat cave as a boy. In one movie, he falls into the cave while running in angst over his parents death. In Batman Begins, Bruce falls into the bat cave while his parents are still living, and while he's playing around at Wayne Manor.There were a few other things that led me to believe that keeping to the same storyline isn't that important to different directors. But overall, a good film to add to your Batman collection."
2,More Hollywood Garbage,"I get sick of the same tired faces. I know these ""stars"" have to make a living, but they should learn a trade, like carpentry. I watched the usual explosions and shootings and got bored after 10 minutes. Overkill as usual."
1,NO JAPANESE SUBTITLES,"I purchased this item, as advertised, with Japanese subtitles to watch with friends who do not speak English. When I received the movie and put it in to watch it, it DOES NOT have the Japanese Subtitles. It was very disappointing."
3,not very good but better than batman and robin,"alot of people have been saying when this film came out that it was great but to me it wasnt that great, batman begins had problems in it like every time theres a fight scene the camera is always shaking so you dont know whats going on plus christian bale has to be the worst batman because no affence to christian, he was good in american psycho and the machinist but christian has to be the worst batman because he does that stupid gruff voice, I dont want to bash on batman begins to much because it isnt the worst batman film made (that would be batman and robin) but batman begins had alot of flaws that were fixed in the next film dark knight."
3,batman begins is a little too weird for me.,this movie does NOT have any jokes at all!!!! why? the other super hero movies have jokes why not this one? like: spider-manfantastic four the teenage mutant ninja turtles movie all did but this? nope not a single joke at all oh well i never really liked batman anyway
5,WIsh it were the first Batman,"I just watched Batman Begins and all I can say is WOW!!!, this is ""THE"" Batman movie. Its to bad this wasn`t the first of the Batman movies. Its well written with lots of action. The first of the movie is a little slow but the rest makes up for it. If your looking for a couple of hours of good entertainment get this movie."
5,What other Batman movies???,"I heard it once before I went to see the movie. ""Once you see this one, the others will not exist..."" It's true.The best part about any of the first movies to me is the fact that Jack Nicholson played the Joker. Beyond that, those first movies cannot hold a candle to this film.Dark, cynical, brutal, wicked... All describe this version of the story. The way Batman was originally intended. Christian Bale does an great job of portraying this character. This movie actually shows us Bruce's transformation and hardcore training he goes through in order to become the superhero we all know and love.I got to see it on IMAX too. Outstanding!!!"
2,No more...,"Rehashes the same 'moral' question about vigilantism as any Batman movie, but without action or laughs. The whole corrupt city being saved by a rich man is so simplistic and trite as to appeal to only the most sycophantic libertarian.Holmes' character is totally pointless. Bale, who is obviously talented after 'The Machinist', is emotionally flat. And the great actors of Caine and Morgan are left on the sidelines- one to explain emotion and one to explain gadgets.I wish I hadn't seen it as it erases some of my memories of Keaton and Bassinger and Nicholas in a movie that had thrills and laughs..."
2,IT ISN'T FULL SCREEN IN THE BOX!!!,"I was so disappointed when I ordered this from Amazon! I hate widescreen and having the picture cut so I specifically ordered this so I can get FULL SCREEN! I opened the movie which said Full Screen on the front, only to find out the DVD inside was really WIDESCREEN! How could Amazon do that!? I wonder if they're just reselling movies. Very careless on their part and I would return it except I already threw the receipt away because I had assumed Amazon would get it right. Don't think I'll use Amazon again."
1,terrible,"positives:1 christian bale is the best batman to date2 morgan freeman is in itnegatives:1 the movie is from start to finish: horrible2 no plot3 once again, they throw in a couple of bat-villains in poor undeveloped fashion4 katie holmes is fuggly5 morgan freeman is too smart to be in movies like this6 you have to pay at this point to see this movie...wait until it graces the rarefied air of hbo and you'll thank me because you can change the channel to underwaterbasketweavingweaveoff2005 or just go to sleep in your la-z-boy (anything is better than this snooze fest)seriously though i can't believe how bad this movie was"
4,highly recommended,"good film. absorbing. Bale and Holmes have good on screen chemistry. Christopher Nolan nailed it. As a fan of comics, this is what I imagine it to be."
4,A real beginning for the franchise,I felt that this movie depicted the Dark Knight as he should have been in previous attempts. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and will probably watch it several more times.
3,FOR THOSE HAVING BLURAY ISSUES,"First of all, great movie.Now, for those of us who have had issues with their bluray copies as I have, try this: The minute you see the FBI warning, press the ""menu"" button (make sure you press the right menu button. You want to get the the movie's menu. Not your bluray player's menu.). That works 8/10 times.I've bought three different copies of this movie. 2 directly from amazon.com brand new and sealed!!! On my third try I bought it used in ""very good"" condition. Still wouldn't work so I just started playing with the buttons and discovered the trick. For all the hassle I went through, I went with a 3 out of 5 stars. Sorry WB. You messed up when pressing these blurays.Hope that helped.Other than that stupid issue, this is a great movie with a great origin story, great acting, music, action... you get the point."
5,$7.99 Blu-ray & Rental What More Can I Say,"I recently decided to start increasing the size of my blu-ray collection, by mainly getting some of my favorite movies. Batman Begins is by far one of my favorite movies and an amazing retelling of the Batman legend. Amazon definitely had the best price for the combo you get in the deal. For $7.99 you're not only getting the blu-ray, but you are also getting an on demand rental from Amazon. I have not used the rental yet, but saw it pop in on the Roku box. Movie came in just a few days and the quality could not have been better.Pros:- You get the blu-ray and a rental, so you can watch right away- You can't beat the price, unless you get it used somewhere- It's Batman and it's awesomeCons:- NoneOverall great movie and great price. Well done Amazon."
2,"This movie was never that good.,",I also do not know why they bothered with this limited edition gift set. The extra disk does nothing except waste your time.
3,"Amazing image quality, but...",Stunning image quality but the box is very poor! the blue box is full of holes! I didn't understand the reason! I never saw a blu-ray with a box like that. Veeeery weird!
3,its worth the $,i got this for like 10 buckskinda forgot i had itbut the picture is sharp and truesounds good i wasnt a huge fan of theprevious batmans but these are awesome
3,Part 2 of my Batman Begins review part 1 is on the Batman Begins 2009 rerelease DVD reviews 7/10,Look for the 2009 release on page 2 or just look in my reviews. I was naming off some flaws of the movie another 1 is Scarecrow taking basically a backseat to Ra's Al Ghoul but yeah I like this movie not as much as the Tim Burton Batman but Batman Begins is better than that sorry ä** piece of s*!t Batman & Robin. Chris Nolan your a d@** good director you did a good job.
3,"After watching ""The Dark Night"" this pales in comparison.","It's a good movie but ""The Dark Night"" is much better. Not saying that this wasn't good but I guess that I got spoiled watching this after ""The Dark Night"""
3,Great special effects but?,"Ok I am going to rant a little.I thought the movie was good for an action film,but for a Batman movie ,NO.They always have to change things that are from the the original story,Why.OH I forget,it's artistic license.BULL .Someone said that this makes the joker more real,like batman is real in the first place,he is a fantasy character,no human can do that stuff.they should of left the Joker the way he was.People can still read between the lines and get the hidden meanings.You do not have to make him more human for us to get it.Quit changing it,like making Raz al Ghul as Batmans teacher in Batman begins.How about making the movie for us not your artistic selves.Become a painter if you want to be artistic.Well at least the cartoons usually stick to the original story line.I said I just wanted to rant and this gives me a chance to say how I feel about these producers and their artistic talent crap."
4,Better than the last two movies.,Fantastic come back for the film series with Christian Bale as the Cape Crusader starting his war on crime. Christopher Nolan recreates the series with a dark mood that almost rivals Tim Burton's first two Batman movies but he does lack the flare and the bravado that Burton brought to those films as well as the underlining sense of evil that Gotham had in it's core. Nolan meanwhile does give a sense of realism to the madness of the city and it's hero and that's where the movie big surprise is. I think that this is a great come back for the series and I hope there will be a sequel to it to see where Batman goes from there.
5,Step away children,"First of all every time a superhero movie is gonna come out marvel,dc,or any other,kids are always the first in line to go see it but just cause this movie is rated pg-13 doesn't mean it's for kids not like they can't see it but you know.I mean really this batman(which is the best)is how he really is.Batman has always been a dark character who has anger,wants revenge,whether is to kill or bring them to justice and truly this is not a character children want to look up to.He's like the punisher only that he doesn't use guns but cool gadgets and they have the same intesions.This movie is waaay different from any of the other batman films(""and george clooney as batman,ARE YOU KIDDING ME!"")it takes it more serious and is just a movie for grown ups(not like there's blood,nudity,or anything else)but really once you look at this batman film you will see it really MUCH MORE MATURE,THE WHOLE STORY AND EVERYTHING,BALE RULES!"
5,IT BEGINS....2005!,"I've followed this film's production for a good while now. This movie will reboot the Batman franchise. The story will be a treat for Batfans non-Batfans alike.Judging from his interviews, Christian Bale is taking this role very seriously, even dedicated it to his father who passed away the end of last. This man will become the new embodiment of Batman/Bruce Wayne.June 17th everyone...it Begins!!!"
4,Much better than I thought it would be,"I'm not a Batman fan but I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I ever would. The movie has a good story and it fleshed out the main character better than I anticipated. I also like how they didn't use popular villains and still had an excellent story. This moody and thrilling film is something that I'd recommend to both fans of the comics and newcomers alike.While the story is good, its not complex enough for me to give it a 5/5. Nor is the action something to brag about."
5,Can't decide whether I like this more than TDKR,"I'm in the odd group of people who were not that into The Dark Knight. Christopher Nolan did Bruce Wayne very well. His Batman however, felt a little generic. It wasn't bad, just far less interesting than his take on Bruce Wayne. Batman Begins has more Bruce Wayne than Batman, which is a very good thing for me. It depends really. What do you like more? Bruce Wayne or Batman?"
5,OUTSTANDING !!!!!,We had movie night at my sisters new place after i told her how great Dark Night Rises. too my surprise my little sis has never seen any of the new Dark Night series. This was a great time for all of us.
4,Good Movie,I liked Batman Begins because it gives an in-depth description of how batman became batman. I would reccomend it to anyone who likes comics.
4,No Digital Copy,This could have only been better if they had included a digital copy to the purchase. They have digital copy available through vudu for the last movie only and that kinda sucked.
1,Use your money on something else!,"My 2 and 1/2 year old loves Bob, so he played with this for a little while. Tired of it quickly, as the magnets are not strong enough to hold blocks together to have any real pretend play. Seriously, every time he tries to open the door for Bob, the whole house falls down. The blocks are so light weight that his wooden block set is more fun to build a house with. Buy the Bob the Builder lego set and stay away from this set!"
3,It's okay but could be better,"My son loves the magnetic blocks because they stay together and don't topple like plain plastic or wooden blocks, and they have unique shapes, not just square. And he loves Bob and Wendy. But it's hard to get the little dormers to stay on the roofs and hard to get the roofs to stay on the wall blocks, if you're trying to build the houses as shown in the picture. And the door you see open behind Wendy in this pic is ALWAYS falling out of the door frame, and it's hard to put it back together. The blocks and trees are nice but the roof and door pieces aren't that great. But he is always playing with this set, so I give it 3 stars overall."
2,"Dreadful Quality, like all the Bob playsets","We have the Bob Toolbox playset, and it is junk, too. The only good thing about this set is that you get Bob and Wendy, and at least they don't break. If your little one likes Thomas the Tank Engine, buy those playsets instead. They are so much better made that it is ridiculous. They cost a bit less, too. The take along Bob vehicles are nice, but the larger talking vehicles, junk as well! My four year old loves his Bob the builder toys, but they are a huge pain because the design and quality are shoddy. You do need to know that before you buy. These are not toys you can set up and feel confident that they will get hours of trouble free play. The pieces fall off, some of the pieces do not fit properly. It is annoying, but kids love it."
1,Poorly Made,My 2 1/2 year old boy is obessed with Bob the Builder and construction. These blocks are junk. The magnets hardly hold the bricks together. Not enough pieces to make anything. Very poorly designed. Roof pieces will not stay attached. Don't waste your money!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Save your little Bob fan a truckload of aggravation,"My 2 1/2 year old son is a big Bob fan, and when I first heard about the 'click bricks' idea, I thought it would be great for toddlers and preschoolers. Not so. Only certain areas of each brick are magnetic, and they don't fit together in any intuitive way. It's impossible to build the structures you see on the box using the magnetic points as anchors, so basically you're just piling plastic bricks on top of each other that will fall over at the slightest touch. That makes it pretty frustrating for a toddler who wants to do something as simple as opening a door so Bob or Wendy can go into a building. This toy was a big disappointment. On the bright side, he can play with the Bob and Wendy figures in our Fisher Price house, and we've been building Duplo houses for them. Unless you want to deal with a frustrated and disappointed toddler, I'd recommend avoiding these sets!"
1,Really - Read the reviews.,"I read the reviews and still bought this and the shed for my bob the builder fan. This stuff really is terrible. My son wanted over and over to build the house as shown on the box - it can't be done.You just can't build anything - not even the face of a house. Not even because the magnets do not hold but because there aren't the right shape bricks.He uses the bricks now as Skip's load but surely there are cheaper things for Skip to cart around! Also the Bob the Builder Shed is terrible - I super glued it together in the end as if you just touched it, it fell apart. The vehicles and die cast characters are A+++ but the other stuff is utter rubbish. Get Wendy and Bob on e-bay!"
1,"Lacks Safety, Durability","Issue 1 - The magnets are not secure. One piece ( a yellow sign, came apart and the magnet fell out. Either of my children (age 29 months and 7.5 months) could have choked on the small magnet.Issue 2 - The idea of magnetic blocks sounded great. After attempting to play eith them, my 2 year was a little frustrated, as was I. We couldn't build much. He has found it easiest to lay the pieces end to end and make lines, not buildings. It doesn't leave much room for creative play."
5,Still playing with it....,"My son got this toy for his second birthday and he's still playing with it nearly two years later. When he first got it he did have a hard time building anything with it, but he loved the Bob & Wendy figures - they went everywhere he did.Lately he's been building all kinds of elaborate structures with the bricks and is not limited by the fact that the roofs don't stay - he uses them for ramps and decks and other things. We never tried building the stuff on the box, so I can't really say if that ""works"" or not. All I know is he's gotten a lot of use out this toy and we're considering buying another set."
1,Choking Hazard Beware!,"My Daughter pulled apart the ""tree trunk"" that came with this set and the tiny magnets inside fell out along with very small plastic parts. She is almost four but still put the ""candy"" in her mouth. We ended up spending half the day getting her checked out and now must watch her and her brother to make sure they did not swallow a magnet (one magnet is missing). she is not generally rough on her toys and this came apart way too easily. So if you have children under @ 6, beware. Only let them have this if you are right there with them at all times. If I hadn't been right there my child could have died."
2,Could be better,"I've had this windshield mount for a few months now, and while it works, I can't really say that I would recommend it to anyone else.As the other review said, it shakes quite a bit while driving. However, that is bearable compared to the real problem--the pivot head is just not very sturdy. Hitting the smallest bumps on the road, or even just turning, could cause the pivot head to swivel, leaving your PSP in a slanted position.The pivot head swivels while driving whether or not I have the PSP docked in the windshield mount, so it's not an issue of weight. I end up having to adjust its position every few minutes, which is not exactly the safest thing to have to do while driving."
3,Nice mount but....,"this is a nice product, but the only thing that i dont like about it is that it shakes too much, so you cant really watch anything while you are on the road. if the Arm would be smalle maybe it wont shake to hat much."
1,Rod Stewart And The Faces: In Concert,"This DVD of Rod Stewart and The Faces In Concert is a total BOOTLEG. The cover is with Ronnie Lane who was not in the band during the recording of this concert. This DVD is the final concert with Keith Richards. I'm sick and tired of companies putting out concerts with different covers of the same ones you already have. It's like bait and switch. And I am a number one Faces fan and this is a load of BS. And for those looking at the Rod Stewart and the Faces: Live In London, this DVD is the DVD featuring Keith Richards in his final concert, different cover. And honestly, this is the weakest show of the Faces I have ever seen because of Tetsu. You cannot even hear his bass in this DVD. I have a bootleg of this DVD that's a better quality than this one. Please do not put money in the pocket of this company, the only good thing about this is the cover.Yours truly,Number One Faces Freak."
4,Arkansas has electricity!,I would have given this 5 stars if the audio was re-mastered in 5.1. although it sounds like what you would expect from a 1970's concert. It's great to see one of the best country rock bands from the 70's in a live show. Tommy Aldridge could be the best double bass drummer of all time so he is a show all by himself. For those of you who have always loved 'Raunch n' Roll' this is a must for your collection. I still can't believe they do there own version of the Beatles classic 'Taxman'. It's also cool to hear a live version of 'Jim Dandy' which is not on 'Raunch N' Roll'. If you are a 'Black Oak' fan this will leave you yearning for more.
2,Worked for a year,"This was a handy device which worked nicely to trim nose and ear hairs on this aging head. But after one year of not that frequent use it just died. Until it died, I did enjoy it. It's a bit pricey for 12 months of use."
2,This does not fit certain bikes,"It would be nice if they specified in the description of the product that it will not fit a number of different styles of bikes. I have a carbon frame bike that it won't even come close to fitting because of the size of the downtube. It also will not fit an aluminum frame bike my daughter has for the very same reason. Because of the cost to return, I kept it and gave it away to someone with a standard butted steel frame. I am disappointed that it didn't work for me and I wasted my money. Again, the limitations of this stand should be included in its description."
2,For The Old,"I have 2 very modern bikes. The frames have oversized downtubes. One frame is aluminum, the other high-end carbon. The bend on this stand (where it hooks around the downtube) does not fit either frame. Would recommend this to someone who rides steel frame bicycles. It is ideal for those that have smaller diameter tubes.For the modern bikes, this product is USELESS."
5,Works great on my Diamondback Hybrid,Haven't had any issues with the size of the frame. It is larger then a road bike frame but fits fine.
3,Useful but not a repair stand replacement...,"i bought this hoping to have a really cheap repair stand. it works pretty well, except for anything related to the bottom bracket. the bottom stand is too narrow for my bike (KHS Flite 100) and shifts from side to side.sometimes, it is even hard to put the bike on straight. as a display stand, seems fine. wish the build quality was a little better, but as a repair stand try something else (unless you're really cheap and don't mind the hassle of a bike falling over on you)."
1,NOT for Trek Mountain Bikes,"I just received this stand and went to try it on my Trek 4500 and did not fit, not only did it not fit, but put some scratched on my bike :o(. So now I'm stuck with this stand that will most likely not do anything for me. It's not worth returning it. I paid $8.49 for the stand and the same for shipping. $16.98 total. It will cost me about $5 to ship it back so I will only get $3 back after it's all said and done which to me is not worth it.If you plan on using this on a Trek Mountain bike look elsewhere, it will not fit and will scratch it. :o("
4,Buy it,"Works. Simple product to use. Must be careful in nesting the bottom bracket to make the bike stand straight. I hook it on the down tube, lift the bike and slowly move it forward as I let it down. That helps rotate the stand under the bottom bracket. Need to watch carefully that it is nested properly and not up toward the hook."
2,"Not even adaquate for older, round downtubes","These Sunlite/Pyramid BB stands have a notorious habit of shifting under the bicycle it is suspending, rendering the bike ever so slightly angled to one side or another - but just enough that a misguided poke will send the whole mess flying to the floor.I once exhibited a series of vintage and modern lightweight road bicycles at a show wherein these stands were provided by the event organizers. I had the foresight to bring chainstay/seatstay hook stands (even then, not the best - crank mount stands are my preference) for my personal bikes, which served their purpose as intended during the event. On the other hand, we nearly lost a Cinelli MASH to one of these BB-shell stands, and had a few close calls with the other bikes as well.I might use one of these in an emergency, but I would not rely on it. Neither would I expect the vinyl-coated hook to refrain from damaging a thin, 1970's-era paint job - or a current-era clearcoat, for that matter."
5,In use since 1989.,"Bought one 21 years ago from my local bike shop.Used it to hold my bike up and as a work stand.Doesn't work well with over sized tube bikes since ""hook"" is too small to hook.Rubber came off awhile ago, but replaced with duct tape.I don't think I'll ever need to buy another one since there's nothing to break or fail."
3,Not the best.....,"...but still a lot better than other rock/power pop albums around.I'm mixed about Action Pact. One one hand, Sloan have actually have put together an album that sounds cohesive. They've tossed out the Beatles obsession from Navy Blues and One Chord to Another for an AC/DC and Aerosmith obsession, courtesy of Patrick Pentland and Chris Murphy, who pen nearly all the songs. Even though Jay Ferguson contributes only two tracks, one of them, ""False Alarm,"" is the best (and catchiest) on the album. But there's nothing from Andrew Scott, who has supplied some of the strongest (and more piano-driven, art-rock) tracks on previous Sloan releases, and I think that hurts Action Pact.Overall, Action Pact is tight and slick. Having seen them live way too many times, these songs sound a lot better live than on record. Personally, I think that wearing the Beatles on their sleeves was a better fit."
5,Sloan are aging well..,"This is their best album since ""One chord to another"". It's very hard to find an album that rocks as consistantly as this one. Although, they don't experiment as much as they used to, this album is a keeper. If ""The rest of my life"" dosen't get your feet movin' and your pulse a racin', nothing will. Will the rest of the world take notice? This is one of Canada's best kept secrets. The secrets out!"
2,Discouraging,"I've been spoiled by Sloan and their virtuosity on their earlier albums, with different sounds and experimentations, while still incorporating their terrific knack for writing melodic and memorable tunes. One review I read (outside of Amazon) said that the songs on this CD ""gel like no other Sloan album"" as a unit, or something. Another not so praiseworthy way of expressing that thought might be to say that all the songs sound the same. I LIKED the different moods, with vocals and songwriting from ALL the members. It kept me interested and affirmed to me that Sloan was one of the best bands, all around, period. I hope this cd's production isn't a sign of where the band wants to go. They're still falling between the cracks, with songs that are probably intended to be radio-ready, but in this case, just aren't that special. I await their next cd...ummm...anxiously."
2,Hmmmm,"As a US fan, I was certainly irritated that this was not released in the US and that I had to pay $23 for it as an import. This irritation was compounded when I sat down and listened to the album. This is not a bad album, for most bands it would be a solid effort, but I expect more from Sloan. What this album lacks is variety and subtlety. Most of the songs are just a little too straightforward. Other reviewers have commented on the repetitive guitar riffs and lyrics, and I agree.If you are big Sloan fan, you will probably want this, otherwise its a coin toss."
3,"Good for what it is, but sometimes it just doesn't compare.","This album is very straight-up guitar-driven rock.Unfortunately, if you're looking for the a mix of all the band member's different styles, you won't find them here. There's a lof of mechanical guitar rhythms and riffs that can get highly repetitive. Usually you can tell the member's songs apart by sound alone (not including their voice), but that seems to be absent at many points. Andrew doesn't even have a song of his own on this one.""I Was Wrong"" is pretty catchy in itself. Patrick always seems to pull one out of his sleeve.In my opinion, they could have challenged themselves a little more. If you want a wider pallette of songs, go back to Between The Bridges or Pretty Together."
5,Just don't buy there other albums....,"I had not heard of Sloan, till I found this cd at a listening station. I felt it rocked enough to buy it for $23 or so, and I was right. I love every song with the great guitar work and tight vocals. The last track was very trippy and reminds me of a 3 minute Monster Magnet song (if you're a MM fan you'll hear it. In short the album was awsome.Then I went back and bought two of their previous albums, Pretty Together and some other one. That was a mistake. I'm glad they've changed their sound to this album, and hope it continues. Their other works are NOT my cup of tea. Soft/lame/ NO good guitar, etc. In short, there was nothing special about them, no good hooks.If you want a rockin cd, this is it. If not, buy their old albums and not this one."
2,Major Disappointment!!!,"As an Independant Consultant and Solution Provider, Small Business Server was an ideal candidate to add to our arsenal services being offered to our small business owners. To support it we would need some quality technical resources available to us to continue to provide high quality support and I was hoping the Resource Kit would do it. I was complete let down by it's lack of in-depth technical information and seemingly lack of direction. It is nothing more than a product overview. Thumbs down on this one!"
2,I don't know what this book 's target is.,"I have finished this book with only 2.5 days.I feel very disapointed because this book mainly tell you what the features are avaliable in the Small Business Server 2000.This book hasn't tell you how to use them, how to deploy them.The style of the book is many titles in a chapter, but there is only a few words talking the title.I feel that the author is saying like ""There is Remote Access Service with SBS 2000. Then bye bye.""This book is too details for manager/decision maker, but not enough for administrator, so I don't know what this book for."
2,No Substance,"I was expecting something similar to Office 2000 Resource Kit, a very good resource. but instead this book is not at all helpful for anyone who has never installed a server product before or been exposed to network issue decisions. Luckily I come from a Unix/Linux background and could understand the jargon and over emphasized subjects covered in this book. Active Directory is nothing more then an overblown address book (however, it is most useful) it's coverage is overdone in my opinion. Save your money and use the Server help documentation that comes with the product."
1,Sales Brochure,"This book is absolutely useless. It only provided information normally found in a sales brouchure. There was no technical content. It only told you what you could do with SBS, not actually how to do it."
2,Good thing that I didn't rush out and buy the DVD version...,"Thinking that I was missing out on a new release of vintage James Brown,I am so glad that I didn't buy the DVD-Body Heat because I already have the VHS, ""James Brown, the Lost Tapes"". I would have been upset to learn that the DVD is the same as the tape. I am constantly looking for new unseen performance material from Mr. Brown while he was in his hey-days, the 60'and 70's."
2,a triumph of theory over clarity,"This is a book laden with the falsely technical jargon of theory. There may be worthwhile ideas here hidden beneath layers of obscurantist prose, but the game did not seem worth the candle,"
5,weight jacket,i use it alot and i enjoy it and i put xtra wieght in the water bottle pocket for more resistance and i just love the product and i can eve add a weight where the velcro strap is
3,U get what you pay for,Weights hurt your body when strapped tight to your chest/stomach. I run and this does move a bit too much but I guess you get what you pay for I weigh 160lbs male
3,A good vest with weak velcro,"The overall vest was good. However, on the elastic portion where the sewn on velcro begins seemed to be a weak area. only after a few uses it began to tear. To keep the vest from moving around during a workout, I would pull on the elastic straps to get a snug fit. The elastic strap is what began to tear on both sides. Maybe this could be reinforced with velcro sewn on the entire straps. Thank you."
2,Other reviews not helpful,"The weights in my old weight vest have started to desintegrate so it was time for a new one. The price is right and other reviews were very positive. On reviewer who said she was 5'2"" found it too short. I did not think this would be a problem for me because I am considerably taller, 5'7"". However it is too long...sits on the hips rather than hanging from the shoulders and ending at the waist line like my old one does. I do not think it will be very comfortable so I am sending it back. Also, I thought the illustration I looked at showed it as black. It is white, not attractive (How attractive can a weight vest be?) and will probably look dirty very soon and have to be laundered a lot."
2,okay vest but..,"I had bought this vest primarily for pushups but when i tried it on i had noticed that most of the weight was positioned on my mid to lower back area. i was concerned that a.) it may end up causing my form to be compromised and b.) i may also end up ultimately injuring my self or at the very least not reaping the full benefit. otherwise i supposed itd be an okay vest for other exercises that didn't matter if it hung a little low eg pullups, dips.. maybe.. i would NOT recommend this for running or even walking unless you keep your back straight and have perfected your form as you may injure yourself with the lower center of gravity and weight. so at the end of it all i decided to return it and go with the ""mir short style vest"" that was twice as much but was designed with (virtually) all the weight on the upper back and chest area (which may in fact be superior to most vests out there..) hope this helps!"
2,weighted vest,"I bought this vest for my husband who is an avid runner. he had to return it, as he found it to be uncomfortable. it moved around too much as he was running."
5,Great for Getting in Shape and Staying that Way,"Don't think walking is intense enough for you, but running is too intense? Well you can always walk with one of these ten pound vests. This is just super for building up your endurance and believe me, when you're trekking miles away from civilization, carrying everything you need on your back, that endurance you've gained by wearing this vest when you didn't have too really pays off."
3,weight vest review,"I thought this was a good vest for the money. However, as a small woman, I find that it is a little too large for me. Also, since I am using it in hopes to building bone mass in my spine, I wish some of the weights were higher up on my shoulders. But overall, for most ""medium"" size people, this is a good value for the money."
4,Does the Job,"Okay, I am a female and have been walking for more than 10 years now, and needed to step it up without a gym or in home machine...After my first try of this vest, I realize it makes you hotter because of the material its made of which is vinyl-like. So be prepared to heat up much faster when wearing this vest.My shoulders are what notice the weight the most- I figured that. They get sore within the first minute of wearing the vest. But then again I also do not use a backpack to school for that same reason-- I have weak shoulders that get very sore very quickly.But those are the ONLY 'negatives' to this vest-- otherwise I wouldn't even notice I was wearing it at all!I just hope it helps me to lose my extra weight. :)"
3,Walk Vest,I like the walk vest. It is a little big for me. I just make the velcro really tight around my waist. I have been using it for a few weeks and it makes my workout harder.
2,Something went wrong...,"Music is what happens between the notes, someone said. I read Communion, I listened to the audio book reading by Roddy McDowell. As skeptical as I am inclined, both versions got me and gave me vibes of high weirdness. While I listened and read, I bought it. So when I got hold of the video, I was hopeful. But FILMING it and making it a visual treatment hit a brick wall. I watched, found myself saying every few minutes, 'oh give me a Break!', or 'You can't be serious..' I believed Strieber's account LESS after watching. A reading, either on paper or listening to a story teller, reaches inside the mind. Film is for the eyes, visuals first.If you want to test plausibility, take the mystery out of the shady corners inside the mind and put it out front, under lights and cameras. If you can translate it, you might have credibility left."
2,"I'm waiting for a sequel called ""Confirmation""","Ok alien abduction flick. I always like Chris Walken no matter what movie he's in. Maybe if this was made more recently we would have gotten more specifics. You're not sure if something happened or not, but maybe that's what abduction is. Why are the aliens always so ugly, aren't there any planets with good looking aliens? And their not very sanitary, that spaceship looked dirty and so did the probe thing that came out of the wall, do they clean their instruments before they shove them in us? They don't look very healthy, or very clean. Oh well, Enjoy!"
1,Weirdest movie ever,it only had a hint or a flavor of the book. I actually read the book which is really good if you like freaking yourself out. The movie was nothing like it. The movie was just one of those weird 80s things
3,Very Interesting similarities.,"The product quality is fine. I purchased this move to compare with ""The Fourth Kind"". Very Interesting similarities."
5,Confirmation that Christopher Walken truly IS weird!,"Great film. Walken is the only person who could have played this guy so genuinely. In my view, this is the weirdest, most convincing alien abduction film out there. Unsetling, yes. Go see it because it asks more questions than it answers, which is why we like these films, correct?"
4,Christopher Walken scarier than the aliens,"Christopher Walken is scarier than the aliens, but the film manages to stir up some creepy paranoia at times. The scenes aboard the spaceship (or whatever it was) were a little weak, but in the cabin and in that long spooky school hallway were well done."
3,Communion (Special Collector's Edition) (1989)-Just OK.,"Communion (Special Collector's Edition) (1989) was a three star production in this reviewers opinion. Both Christopher Walken and Lindsay Crouse were excellent, but little else is noteworthy. I will say that the film had several near moments, but always came up short of what could have been done."
3,Weird but not bad,"Not a bad movie but alittle different, by all means it's no fire in the sky but if tour into this kinda thing then it's worth the buy."
2,"interesting, but weak - too much like a B movie plot","Among other weaknesses, it was clear that the author didn't know San Francisco very well. That should have been a warning! Too many cliches, not enough depth at all- this could have been a rich disturbing story, instead it was one dimensional and rather juvenile. Dissapointing"
5,You can find 15 minutes a day for Donna,"When you get an exercise video, you're never quite sure if it's going to be used once or twice and then just collect dust on your video shelf or if it's one you will use over and over again. The Donna Richardson 4-Day Rotation Workout is one you'll use over and over--I promise! She focuses on upper body, hips and thighs, buns and abs, each within 15 minutes. (You can certainly do more than one segment per day if you're so inclined!) This includes warm-ups and cool-downs. It's a do-able workout and in 15 minutes you'll feel like you did something good for yourself. She also emphasises correct form/posture/breathing for doing each exercise which is very important, too. If you're interested in toning your body and spending 15 minutes a day to do it, I recommend this video."
4,Great Workout Video!,With only fifteen minutes to spare anyone can exercise. Donna does a great job of giving you a really good workout. Her high energy is catchy. Only thing I did not like about this video were the annoying comments from the two women exercising with Donna.
5,Great Exercise Video!,"February, 2003This is an excellent toning video. Donna provides very specific, comprehensive workout routines that quickly and effectively tone all the problem areas of the body--arms, abs, buttocks, and thighs. The exercises are intermediate level, including warm-ups and cool down exercises all in a flexible format that allows you to focus on any part of the body you choose in a variety of different ways. I use this video everyday and alternate it with either one of Donna's ""30 Days to Firmer Arms and Abs"" or ""30 Days to Firmer Thighs"". That way I get a complete workout everyday along with the fat burning exercises offered in the 30-day videos. If you use these, you will lose weight quickly and safely."
5,Great Instructor!,"This is a great workout for all levels. Beginners can start with no weights, intermediates can go for small weights and as you progress you can add ankle weights and heavier dumbells. You can break the video up into 1 segment a day or do any combination. Its great because each segment has it's own warm-up and cool down. I recommend this video because she is a great instructor and very motivating."
3,Good tape for the beginner.,"A great tape for busy folks as each segment is only 15 minutes. A good morning workout, but more suited to the beginner than someone used to doing exercise a few times a week."
2,"Great film, bad print","This is an historic film version, but the print I just purchased from Amazon is of very poor quality. If you go to Netflix, a much better print can be viewed streaming (and it's free to Netflix subscribers). This version for sale on Amazon should be retired. Amazon, please do something!"
1,"1*2*3* Rent, Don't Buy This Canker-Blossom","1 Star for the DVD, 2 for the director, 3 for the cast: I originally saw this for a Shakespeare in film class at U.C. Berkeley 20 years ago, and it's a ashamed that copy wasn't borrowed for this transfer. But even a clean copy wouldn't help this poorly edited ""art"" film. Hall was definitely trying to aspire to arty French and Italian films of the time, but it doesn't work. As for the acting, the women are great - the men cardboard. Helen Mirren's first major film role as Hermia is fun to watch as is Diana Rigg's Helena. It's also pretty fun to see a 35-year-old Judi Dench as the bare-breasted Titania. Ian Holm is way over the top as Puck and a future playing villians is apparent when you see David Warner's attempt as the fair hero and lover. Mirren's second romp in the forest as Titania in the 1981 BBC production is far superior. Buy that one, then rent this to compare the two for fun."
2,Midsummer Night's Dream,"We were dissapointed to discover that the DVD that we got was the same format and picture quality as the original VHS. I believe there is a restored version, we streamed a good quality full screen version from Netflix and I will be looking for this on DVD."
1,NO Close-Captioning!!!,Falsely advertised: this DVD does not have close captioning. I called up Water Bearer Films and they confirmed the DVD does not have CC or English subtitles available.
2,This is the kind of piece that makes people think that they don't like Shakespeare,"This play is so much fun, but you wouldn't know it from this static, phoned-in production. There are some good actors here, but it feels as if someone said, ""You're acting in film, so just pull it way back."" Dull, lifeless. Find the very fun 1968 RSC film version directed by Peter Hall (also with Mirren, but this time as Hermia) and see that instead.Beware: Several reviews here of this version are from reviewers who didn't watch it, but saw Mirren's name, and assumed it to be their beloved 1968 RSC production. It's not."
1,not ready for prime time players!,"very odd version. wanted to show my english class and that did not work out well. good for a few laughs, however."
1,disappointed,"I guess because it was offered to me as ""free"" my Amazon Unbox viewer became corrupted and I was unable to re-install. I expect better from Amazon."
1,Sucks,"This books sucks. Mind you, there are over 350,000 aspiring actors. The majority of them have been told and rehearsed on how beautiful and talented they are.Only 10 new actors are ""broken in"" each year. This book sucks."
3,OK,"This set especially the 2nd half in thay other lawyers were going to court in place of Perry Mason, disappointing..Probably the last of them I will buy."
5,Fantastic,"Perry Mason Season 6 Volume 2 is fantastic and the wait for the next Season seems a long one. Beautifully restored disc and is giving great pleasure. Roll on the rest of the ""Seasons"""
5,The quality is good.,"The quality, clearness, stories and diction are good. If you enjoy a good court room drama, I recommend these series."
5,I'm very happy with this as well,There were no problems with this either. I watched each DVD and all was well. I was both able to hear and see them clearly. So far that hasn't changed. I'm well satisfied. You couldn't be doing things any better than you already are.
4,These chicks rock!,This is a great little collection of Rock tunes. They're kind of like Veruca salt meets Area 7 (another great Austrlian band). Hope to see these guys live after listerning to this cd! Well worth a listen.
2,Dated,"I borrowed this video from the local library. The video could be used to teach beginners to classic cross-country ski provided there was an experienced instructor doing narration, otherwise you may put the class to sleep. The footage consists of long and repeated shots of a single skier traditional skiing, to soft almost hypnotic music in the background. The video is somewhat dated in its technique, equipment and filmmaking, and would be hard pressed to compete with modern videos the likes of Warren Miller (Alpine), Christian Begin (Mtn Biking) or xczone (cross-country skiing)."
2,Good but it ain't warren miller,"This video, like many before it, have prefered to depict the activity as quiet, restful, and meditative. This video is useful to teach beginners to classic ski provided you have an instructor doing the narration; otherwise you may just put the class to sleep.Today the consumer has MTV... Warren Miller (Alpine), Christian Begin (Mountain Biking) and xczone (Cross-country) films-videos to choose from.I found Cross Country Skiing by Jeff Nowak in the library. Compare with some modern titles... you be the judge."
3,Technique video - old school presentation,"This is an instructional video geared towards an enthusiastic beginner to novice classic skier. If you are a keen cross-country skier starting out then give this video a try.Not exactly something you can show to non-skiing friends, the presentation of nordic skiing is very old school. You will have to upgrade to another video at an intermediate level for better instruction and motivation."
1,Doesn't even come close to fitting,"Bought it for my 17"" MacBook and it is inches too big in both dimensions. Can't use it without cutting it down and then you lose the cutouts that allow the cover to close. The company never responded to emails about returning or exchanging.A total waste of money, will never buy from this company again. Bad product and absolutely no customer support!"
1,Don't waste your $$$$,"Would suggest this unless you are in an environment were dust/sand/etc is a major concern. It does cover the keys and for the most part fits, but the typing experience is horrible."
4,Great product.,"I was hesitant to buy this for my new MacBook Pro, but I'm glad I did. I took a little getting used to, but it fits very well over the keys with minimal typing interference. It's not completely transparent so it does cloud the key symbols a little bit, but not enough to make them unreadable in normal light or when the backlighting is on. I don't have any problems with it sticking to the screen (I have the regular, not glossy screen) when the cover is closed. This is cheap insurance for your computer. Liquid spills into the keyboard of a laptop computer are a disaster. The repair will be very expensive and will not be covered under warranty."
4,"Great for protecting your keys, but...",This Keyboard protector is GREAT for protecting your keys. It actually feels really good to type with also. I wouldn't have any gripes about it if i didn't have cats. They cat hair that is floating around my house all the time gets immediately stuck to the protector and is difficult to get off unless you take it off and wash it. I'd have to do that almost everyday if i wanted to keep it cat hair free...Otherwise it's great and i would highly recommend buying it.
4,"Good, just touch pricey.","I picked up an iSkin for my MacBook Pro and I think it is great. It fits well and has a good feel about it. The keyboard backlighting is clearly visible under low light conditions. My only gripe is that it seems a little pricey for what it is. Still, I think it is a good investment for a laptop."
1,The iSkin stretches w/in a 2-3 month period,"I LOVED the iSkin for the first 2 months. Then, it stretches, bubbles over the keys, and doesn't give a good fit. I'm very disappointed. The Apple Store has returned mine a couple of times now and have deduced it just gets heated and stretches. They will take it back now and offer a store credit. I would love a skin that works."
3,"It does the job, but ...","I have a couple of apple bluetooth keyboards for which I bought the ""moshi"" keyboard protectors thatapple sells. These are fantastic. Unfortunately, I could not find one that would fit my (older) Mac BookPro, so I bought the ""ProTouch Keyboard Protector"" by iSkin ...Well, it works, but it is rather thick, so rather than fit snuggly over the keyboard, it sort of floats aboveit. In addition, it makes seeing the letters on the keyboard keys harder. It is transparent, but not crystalclear. With low lighting, it becomes a bit of a pain to see the keys, so I remove it then (and refrain fromhaving coffee or anything like that within a few feet from the keyboard)."
1,Disappointing fit,I was really looking forward to using this product given how pleased I have been with the iSkin covers for both of my iPods. The iSkin cover for the MacBook Pro does not fit well over the keyboard and as another reviewer mentioned it makes the keys hard to read. I plan on returning this keyboard protector.
2,DOES NOT FIT THE NEW MACBOOKS,"does not fit the new 15"" june macbooks or 17"". the F-Keys are in the wrong place, it fits a Tibook g4 BUT NOT THE NEW MACBOOKS BE WARNED. I sent back and had no problems getting my refund and they responded they DO NOT HAVE THE MACBOOK CORRECT SIZE. you have been warned. I give 2 stars for their customer service. understanding no questions asked."
3,Protection vs. Visibility,"If you are like me and enjoy having a cup of coffee sitting next to your laptop, then this is insurance against a catastrophic spill. The big downside is that this keyboard protector seriously reduces the visibility of the keys. At a desk I find this tolerable but if the laptop is balanced on my knees, angled slightly away from me, then it is very difficult to see the keys. Obviously if you're a touch typist this is not going to be so much of an issue.On the plus side I really like the silky feel of the keys under the protector. Its plastic also seems to have an anti-static effect since less dust seems to be transferred to my screen from the keyboard when I close the laptop.The protector that fits the older MacBook Pro will also fit a PowerBook G4 (but not the new late 2008 model of the MacBook Pro)."
2,VR,"Well first of all I dont think anybody should judge Roger, If they did their research they would know what happened, Once Dead was ok a few good tunes but overall it all sounds the same. For the Human Sacrficie Album Mulligan's Stew is probobly my Favorite VR Tune."
4,Excellent Value,"Got these to put in my camper, great for a low watt system. I am surprised at the bass response in these little speakers. I wouldn't put them in a high power system (they are rated at 75 watt) but for a low watt system they sound very good and look great too."
1,You get what you pay for.,One of my Pioneer speakers broke so I took the cheapest path and bought Jensen. I should have known better. The magnet on the Jensen is 1/3 the size of the one it was replacing. I installed the one speaker and before I installed the second one I decided to try it out. Not only did it sound terrible but it blew within five minutes. Keep in mind that I have a standard Kenwood 40x4 head unit without any extra amp and I had it turned up up about three quarters. This speaker is week and as I stated in the title you get what you pay for.
3,Smaller than I thought it would be,"The lampshade is cute and goes well with the decor in my baby's nursery. It's a lot smaller than I thought it would be, though, and hooking it over a lightbulb is semi-annoying. You have to stretch open two metal prongs and hook it over the lightbulb, which requires you to be delicate in order to avoid breaking the lightbulb."
3,Are they worth the money?,"Twinlab Twinsorb CoQ10 may well be the most expensive CoQ10 product on the market. The capsules are huge. They are supposed to provide enhanced absorption.I tried a bottle and, after a month, I didn't ""feel"" any difference. So, I went back to ordering Twinlab's less expensive, 100mg capsules."
2,"Schlocky Fifties horror at its ""best"".","Let's face it, this is not a good film. But it is undeniably fun, due to the outrageous situations, ripe dialog, and at least one good acting performance. As the lecherous and totally rotten mad scientist, Donald Murphy is very effective, and it is surprising that he was not in more films. And as the sincere elderly scientist, Felix Locher is terrible, but enthusiastic. Director Richard Cunha injects a few nice touches here and there, but you have to look closely to catch them. And did anyone on Earth ever watch a film like this in the hope of hearing and seeing two crummy rock-&-roll numbers performed? The most amusing moments are Dr. Frank's instant ""explanations"" to conceal the fact that he has built a monster in the basement, and that it is now walking around the neighborhood. (The one about a lost puppy is priceless.) Worth a look for horror fans."
3,"""B"" Happy","Typical 50's ""B"" silliness. Add a star if you love this stuff, and subtract two stars if you liked ""Sleepless in Seattle""."
4,Two monsters for the price of one.,"A mad scientist builds a female Frankenstein type monster (though it looks male) with the help of the late Dr.Frankenstein's beautiful teenaged daughter and his former assistant. All the while Frankensteins daughter is being fed a secret formula that transforms her into a hidous Edward Hyde type creature at night. A very weird movie with two mnsters, so you wont get bored. Lots of fun from the 50s. During this period Universal's old classic monster films were being rereleased and shown on TV. So a lot of smaller studios decided to release newUniversal style monster movies. FRANKENSTEIN'S DAUGHTER falls into this catagory. Others were FRANKENSTEIN 1970, INDESTRUCTABLE MAN and THE WEREWOLF"
2,"depth, but not 3d","i bought a system like this today (razor 3d the ultimate 3d experience) and have tried 3 dvds with it, used all the different settings, and so far it offers more depth perception, but is definitely not jump-off-the-screen 3d. i was disappointed"
1,a disappointment,"I heard so much about this book but it has so little. Pseudo-intellectual language, undeveloped characters, a few nice parts. Not at all what I expected, and not particularly sexy."
3,So So,"One thing is true. This book is smarter than your average erotica. But that doesn't make it hotter. I found that some of the language was a little bit ridiculous, (I've never met a soul like Andres online)and the sex scenes never quite involved me. It was, perhaps, a little too ""lofty"" for my baser tastes."
3,I thought it was only decent. (Sorry...),"I read the reviews and was very excited about getting this book, but then I found it disappointing. The main character was not terribly likeable (maybe that's just a personality clash between her and I, though) and the plot didn't seem to move very well. Honestly, I can't really remember any true specifics with what I disliked, but I definitely remember the general annoyance and disappointment I had afterwards. Maybe I'll re-read it and write a more coherent review later... *grin* All in all, it wasn't worth the money I spent on it, though I WOULD agree that it was worth the time spent reading it."
2,a thorough disappointment,"Well, it starts out well. The conceit of email sex is skillfully done. In fact, the sexy emails are the only good thing about this book, and when the author unwisely moves away from them, about mid-way through the book, the entire thing falls flat. Aside from the emails, the book is filled with unbelievable characters engaging in anatomically dubious acts described in trite sentences - over and over and over and over. By the end the book has degenerated into a mash of plot-driven pseudo S&M.;Other people's reactions to this book are proof positive that the genitals and the brain are not connected."
4,Morroccan tales,Paul Bowles was a great writer who also did us the service of translating many Morroccan writings. One of these writers is Mohammed Mrabet. This little title Mhashish was put out by the City Lights label many years ago. It contains tales largely revolving around the use of kif (or hashish as Americans would call it) It is a delightful collection of tales. Mrabet is a talented writer. He draws up some tantalizing tales that delve into the positive and negative of this state of mind. It is a good introductory volume for the novice (admittedly I am a novice myself) of Morroccan literature. Mr Bowles did us a great favor in translating numerous works by Mrabet. Let us pray to Allah that City Lights finds it in their hearts to reissue these fine collections of exotic literature.
3,3 stars only for 50th Anniversary edition,"Just a few comments on this 50th anniversary--supposedly FINAL--edition of the translation:1) After 50 years Anscombe STILL did not fix the snafu in section 412 where she forgot to translate a parenthetical. She was informed of this in the 1950's!2) To change the translation of ""Lebensform"" from ""form of life"" to ""life-form"" after all these years is unnecessary and stupid. It rings too much of biology and Star Trek.3) To change the pagination, by which all references to Part II and inserts to Part I have been made for 50 years, is an unnecessary bother.4) The translation has NEWLY-INTRODUCED typos in sections 38, 41, 47, and then I stopped counting. How is this an improvement?Please bring the older editions back in print!"
4,Great for anyone even considering the military,"At 31, I was considering the military. I thought it would be something to join and have a job. However, this book gave me the inside of what REALLY goes on in the military, Good and Bad. For me , this book really helped in making my decision."
4,Living Angel,"There is a wide variety of Latin on this CD: some smooth, some stacatto, some furiously fast, a Rumba and a merengue. One track in particular, though, is interesting: Lejos de Ti, which sounds like a track I have called ""Yo Naci En Puerto Rico"", which is attributed to Hector Lavoe in most places on the Web. However, the quality of the music isn't as good as elsewhere on the disc, in part as the crowd is more than slightly boisterous; the other songs are not live. If you like Canales' sound, this is a good place to go for it"
3,----Ho-down---,"--nice cover art....great selections....though impressive, --tempos too fast to be enjoyable"
5,Shaping Seattle Architecture,"A fabulous history of Seattle in word and photograph. It is a Who's Who listing those that gave Seattle her flavor and distinguished character. This is a must read and study for all native Seattleites as well as for newly arrived residents. The buildings: commercial, residential and schools show the step by step progress that the city has made through the designs of noted architects. From 1853 to date the book covers Seattle's development. It is a first class read and study."
3,Literally falls apart,"This is an excellent book that covers its subject admirably. I enjoy flipping through it both for the information and the nostalgia it affords me as someone who is proud to have once lived in the Emerald City.The problem is that the pages fall out. My particular copy is not bound terribly well - and I am not the type of person who treats books roughly!Alas, the book is not 'bound' to last."
4,Good Story,"This is a very good story of women relationships, set in the old timey rural South. Charlie Kate was a tough character, but I guess that is what it takes to survive, especially if you are a woman taking care of yourself and your family."
2,STRUGGLE OF WOMEN,"I was disappointed in this book. I am searching for a book that is equally as awesome as 'A Virtuous Woman', but it looks like Kaye Gibbons isn't going to give it to us. In this book the women are survivors because they have to be. I was disappointed in the cold, compassionless character of Charlie Kate. Her character shined through her words and actions: beneath that arrogant surface lay a very insecure, unsatisfied, unfulfilled, and angry person. I can understand why she didn't have a man: who would want her? Her hatred of men, I think, was more of a jealousy. She had no compassion, so she tried to make up for it in her 'intelligence' and 'literacy'. She tried to hide behind those midwife skills. Although the book was long, it was shallow and I expected a deeper plot."
1,"This book holds few ""charms""","I was vastly disappointed with this novel. I had read and admired ""Ellen Foster"" and was optimistic when ""Charms"" was selected by my book club. Unfortunately, the plot was facile, superficial, and unbelievable -- a fairytale with pretensions to reality. The characters were stereotypes, drawn with the broadest brushtrokes, with no remotely ""human"" qualities. What qualities they did have were repellent, a trio of do-gooders with no compassion for human failings other than their own. In short, I found this novel insultingly smug and sanctimonious, the kind of novel that gives Southern literature a bad name."
2,"This book is not another ""Ellen Foster""!","What a desappointment! As soon as I finished reading Ellen Foster, I was hungry for another book by Gibson. I am sorry to say Charms of the Easy Life did not give any insight of teh characters, they are treated very sketchy, I could not have any feelings for any of them (I adored and admired little old Ellen). This book is boring, boring, boring."
2,disappointing read.,"This book started off well and you really got a feel for this wonderful and special older woman who was a healer and the central character. As the book progressed it became a struggle to read because of the other characters and their inter-relationships. It simply never came together for me.I have, however, enjoyed other Kaye Gibbons books."
1,BAD: DONT READ!!!,I had to read this book for my school's reading list. It was by far the worst book that I have ever read. There was no plot at all. All of my friends also thought that it was bad. Even some of my friend's parents thought so too!! My final word is DONT READ IT!!
5,Great Book,This book is easy reading that takes you back to a simple time. Has a 1930's or 40.s feel to it.
5,A taste of the south comparable to Welty,"Gibbons' Charms for the Easy Life captures the lives of three generations of southern women. The tale is interwoven with humor, compassion, and Gibbons' brilliant style. The power of this novel transcend the mere power of the written word - it changes and enriches the reader."
2,I'm clearly missing something here,"Not being a woman, or a midwife, or a semi-witch, or a southerner, I'm sure I missed something about this book. It wasn't necessarily bad - I can appreciate the craftsmanship of the text - it just really didn't speak to me on a personal level. Still, not a bad read for a rainy afternoon."
3,Not the best book ever.,"I had to read this book to do a review on for a college class. It was okay, but not one that had me staying up late at night to get to the end. I thought the story shouldn't have ended the way it did. It just seemed like it wasn't finished."
4,Wonderful and Powerful !,I have read several Kaye Gibbon's novels and found this to be a wonderfully passionate and emotional novel. Charlie Kate represents a forward thinking woman who was not afraid to care for sick and desolate people of that era. I found much substance in the novel. I am in the medical profession and felt that Kaye Gibbons did her homework regarding herbal remedies and medical treatments that seemed appropiate. Take time to read this novel it is worth it!
2,Cinderella in the South,"This story is more than a little farfetched -- quirky unlicensed but sought-after physician grandmother enlightened enough (in the U.S. South, in the 1940s and 1950s) to give abortions and do CPR on colored folk -- silly mom -- plain young girl who has no exposure to males in any form or at any age, who suddenly falls in love with a rich privileged handsome guy with curable war wounds. It instantly blended into a dozen or so such chick-lit feel-good southern stories I've read over the past decade or so, and like them left not a trace on my brain or imagination."
3,A very nice read,"This book is a kind and gentle read. There are no startling insights or life-altering observations, but it is worth reading because it does speak of values and ethical behavior. The grandmother is a strong woman whose opinions are revered and who doesn't tolerate fools. She is unfailingly consistent in her outlook and mission, which is to help other people - with or without their consent. Her daughter is lonely and well-meaning, and the granddaughter is growing into herself and her beliefs with help from her grandmother. This book has charm."
5,This is one of the best books I have ever read!,"As a librarian, I am always looking for books that appeal to a variety of our clients, as well as, a book that I will enjoy. This book is absolutely wonderful! It moved me by the strength of Charlie Kate and weaving of the tale of war, romance and a coming of age for Margaret. I have read this book 3 times within the last 4 years and the ending always moves me to tears. This is a fabulous book."
4,Southern Spunk,"This book is about three generations of strong southern women. My favorite character by far was the grandmother and matriarch, Charlie Kate. She is a self taught healer, and treats her patients with a combination of common sense and tradition. Charlie Kate is feisty and isn't afraid to speak her mind or take on the powers that be. I also dearly loved the relationship she has with her granddaughter (and of course it made me think of my own grandmothers often)."
5,Great,"Charms of the Easy Life was an eventful filled book that left me wanting to know what happened afterwards, How Sophia and Richard went on with their lives, and if Margaret ever goes to college and what happens with she and Tom. Not only does this book excite you with backwood practice of medicine but it also intrests the minds on if the medicine would actually work. It is the story of three women, defied by men but encouraged each other to continue life and live it to the fullest. It is worth reading and passing on to a friend"
5,So good I always own two copies...,"I like to keep a second copy of this book handy in case I need to recommend it to someone. I don't ever want to be without it. The women in this story all live on in my mind/heart long after the last time I read it. I was not crazy about Ellen Foster when Oprah went on and on about it...I always thought she should have chosen this book.I guess if you're ""forced"" to read this for school I would recommend that you have a quick attitude adjustment first. Having been stuck reading some seriously dry assignments long ago in the stone ages, how I WISH a story like this would have been put in my life when I was younger! I can't understand a word of the negative reviews here.It's like chocolate.I understand how people might not like brussel sprouts even though I do. I don't understand how anyone can possibly NOT adore chocolate. That's what Charms for the Easy Life is for me."
5,Essential Truth,This book recognizes that our actions flow from our beliefs. It does an excellent job of using the truths of the Bible to align our beliefs with God's love for us. Our good actions flow from God's profound assurance of freedom and love.
5,a 100% indispensible handbook when visiting Alaska.,This is probaly the best hiking book of any such types. truly informative. The pages seem to be made of a light density papyprus product...making it ideal for backpacking. The Author has truly captured the essense of hiking out in the Alaska Booneys.
2,Slippery in the shower,"If you are nervous about slipping in the shower or don't have good balance, don't get this! It really needs little suction cups or something to stay in place. You have to step on it with one foot to be able to use it on the other foot and it just left me tipping and almost falling every time. I ended up using in on the carpeted floor, sitting on the couch and even then, it was difficult to file every angle of my heel. Wouldn't recommend if you want a good file on your feet."
1,what happened??,"I had one of these in use for about two years, and everything was fine with it...recently, I changed it for a new one, and it came apart within a week... I don't recommend it anymore... at all."
4,Like Very Well,"My sister uses this and recommended it to me. It is easy to use, convient and the results are immediatly visable. I use this file in between professinal pedicures. Place the file in the shower and pull your feet across it - you can see the dead skin coming off. Leaves your feet amazingly improved. Priced well."
4,Scarry science,"I am a physicist and this program was quite interesting for me. Difficult research is presented in very simple manner and can be understood by almost everyone. Some facts were new to me and I truly enjoyed watching it. I would give it 5 stars, but there is something on the back of my mind - at the end I found it a little bit too simple in terms of visual contents."
3,You will need size,The cup holder itself is a great idea. Unfortunately it does not allow for any sized cups and as such will not work with many tried. The holder also does not allow for someone who lifts the walker as the liquid spills out of it to easily.It was something that sounded like a great idea but just didn't quite make the grade.
3,Doesn't hold much,"You can put a 12 oz can in here okay, but a 16 oz drink will cause it to let go of the pole it is attached to."
5,Talk about moisterizing your skin.....,without feeling greasy....on addition to this product I bought a body cellulite massager and the combination works great but this cream without anything else is a great moisterizer; therefore the skin looks renewed and less bumpy. While we were on vacation my husband asked me what could he used on his ankles that were so dry. I gave him this pot of cream and he wouldn't let it go. Nivea is a trade mark of years of great products! Look for my other reviews on their sun kissed products.
1,Not for everyone's skin,"After I started working out, watching my diet, purchasing Delfin Spa shorts, I thought this would be the final step in getting rid of any stubborn cellulite before bathing suit season began. I purchased this for $27 (not including shipping). At the end of one week, I have a rash that's spread from my ankles to the top of my thighs, my upper arms, my chest and part of my abdomen. It looks and feels like I've been attacked by a million red ants. After a day, symptoms got worse. Never having any skin problems like this before, I went to the clinic. After $64 for the visit, $62 in prescriptions, I am now going to be on 10 pills a day for the next 14 days to get this cleared up. To boot, sweat isn't allowed, so no working out either. My lesson: STICK WITH THE TREADMILL, and use the money on a personal trainer. And my advice - try the Delfin Spa shorts and a run if you're trying to get rid of cellulite. They're cheaper and they actually work."
4,Good Reference,I found this book to be very informative and easy to follow if you decide to build a Chimney Swift tower. I built my tower in March 2007 so that I can attract the Swifts to control flying insects like mosquitos and I am still waiting for my first Swift to take residence. My neighbors were very curious about what I was building and I enjoyed educating them about the value of Chimney Swifts. I am sure the Swifts will find the tower eventually.
2,No happy ending here--be warned!!,"****MAJOR SPOILER****DON'T READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW****Before I invested time watching this, I wish I had found a review saying there was a death of a major character at the end. I wouldn't have bothered, it wasn't that good anyway. Maybe this review will save someone. Giving it 2 stars because I've seen abyssal films that only deserve 1-star, and this is not that bad."
3,But who's guiding your heart?,"I saw this movie on life time and agree with other reviewers that it is one of the most decent love stories except for the daughter giving the mother the finger and teaching her how to drink but that's pretty clean for Hollywood these days. It does have a anti-parent feel to it that wants to make you believe you can do better without them but let me warn you about getting your messages about life from Hollywood you can only go as high as humans can go in their presentation. Just human love, sucess, and music is not enough to live by especially when facing death you certainly need something higher than yourself in both cases. Besides that the movie does give you a better understanding of what it means to be deaf both the good and bad situations it carries with it"
1,No cliche unturned,"The cliche's:1. The supportive wise black friend,2. The overbearing to the point of unbelievable mother3. The hero is perfect, has higher ideals than Jesus4. When he goes into convulsions on the floor, I thought, here we go, he's dying of cancer, sure nuffWorst movie I've seen in a while, then again, I'm not female, nor under the age of 16."
2,Overdone,"There is handicap and deadly disease, poverty, alcoholism, loss of a parents during childhood and super abusive mother. All that topped off with great love and forgiveness. Little bit overdone even for my (romantic) taste."
5,Inspiring and Uplifting,"Few films these days are truly inspired and challenge the viewer to become a better person for having watched the film. This is a rare gem that does just that. This film is crammed full of emotion and heart. It is absolutely a testament to the fact that love, generosity, selflessness, having an appreciation for life and caring for each person we meet will make this world a better place. This film will challenge you to take life and your dreams to the next level. ...And keep those tissues nearby. With this much emotion packed in, you'll definitely need them."
5,A down-to-earth glimpse into the daily life Trinidad,"A Brief Conversation And Other Stories presents thirteen vivid short stories by award-winning author Earl Lovelace. This are fictional tales which offer a down-to-earth glimpse into the daily life Trinidad denizens. Ordinary people facing the challenges of the ever-changing rhythm of their world, brought to life with Caribbean zest and style in the narration. Superb crafted literary gems, the stories comprising A Brief Conversation And Other Stories include: A Brief Conversion; The Fire Eater's Journey; The Coward; The Fire Eater's Return; Call Me 'Miss Ross"" for Now; Those Heavy Cakes; George and the Bicycle Pump; Fleurs; The Midnight Robber; Joebell and America; Shoemaker Arnold; Victoria and the Blight; and The Gambler's Funeral."
3,"If you love action and romance, read this book.","Set against the backdrop of the Wars of the Roses, The Black Arrow is an intriguing look at the life of young Richard Shelton. Richard's life is shaken when he realizes that those he had thought to be his friends are really his enemies, and he is forced to make choices that will determine the course of his life. Although the characters are well-developed and the plot is fascinating, this book is not for the squeemish or lazy reader. The description is not only vivid, it is often gorey. The language is sometimes difficult and a dictionary might prove quite handy. But anyone looking for a well-written, action-packed classic should read this book."
3,This book was not to bad but it could of been better,"The book black arrow reminded me of the stories about Robin Hood. I think that Robert Louis Stevenson just took the story of Robin Hood and added more things to it. Robert Louis Stevenson had a good idea about it. the story had more depht to it than Robin Hood. the way he describe the one chariter makes him look like Robin Hood, because of the way he is dressed. I thought that the book was prety good. The book could have been better."
5,Black Arrow Hits the Mark,This story is fantastic. The author's grasp of the language and speech of the period is wonderful and completely creates an atmosphere that one cannot help but fall into. This is now one of my favorite books!
3,Good,"This is a good book but not the best of Stevenson's adventure novels. Intended to be a bildungsroman a la Kidnapped, it is set in Medieval England during the Wars of the Roses. The character development is not as good as several of Stevenson's other novels and the plot seems more schematic. In terms of creating a historically vivid setting. Stevenson did better with 18th century Scotland than with this period of English history."
5,AMAZING!,WOW! This is one of my favorite books.The story is well written and fairly easy to follow.The archaic english was a bit confusing at first but with kindle's built in dictionary it was actually rather fun.A book i will read over and over.i Certainly reccomend reading.
4,A Solid Adventure Novel,"The Black Arrow was an enjoyable, fast-paced adventure novel. The protagonist was flawed in a way that made him believable and likable. Best of all, his flaws serve the reader as subtle cautionary tales against haste and violence while still providing a very entertaining read.Written for adolescents, I expect that the novel's period-style language would be somewhat difficult for younger readers today although I do think that the lessons are valuable enough that young people should be encouraged to at least attempt what is otherwise a not very challenging read. The ending, the change in the protagonist's goals and his realizations about his own actions were very satisfying.Additionally, I found the free Kindle edition to be adequate and free from distracting format errors or other issues."
4,Not a bad adventure story,"A fun, fast-moving adventure story, set in England in the 1400s, at the time of the Wars of the Roses. One thing I like about it is that the hero makes lots of mistakes. He sort of bumbles through the book, barely escaping with this life, and making a hash of most things...much more realistic than most heroes."
4,An OK Book,"This is an ok book. It is action packed and holds your attention. I think that the main charecter, Dick Shelton, is a lot like many people today even though the book takes place in Medieval times. Dick did not know that he was fighting for his enemy Sir Daniel, the man who had killed his father. I think this is one of the best historical fiction books that I have ever read. I hope that you will like it as much as I did."
2,NOT ONE OF HIS BEST,"When comparing Stevenson's major works, this book just doesn't compare. It's wooden, stilted and written in the voice of Northern UK's speech."
5,Beautiful Bible.,This Bible by Thomas Nelson is beautiful and simple to understand. I recomend it to the Religious.Nelson Villamor y Fleitas.
4,Born Again Arab explains the Bible the Christians,"It's unfortunate that many of Kirban's books are either out-of-print or hard to get. Many Christians familiar with Grant Jeffrey or Hal Lindsey would find much familar ground in Kirban's works. A born-again Arab, Kirban uses many examples from the Bible and then explains what they mean to us today. ""Guide to Survival"" mostly concerns Revelation. Kirban takes us down the road showing the prophecies that tell us how the world will end and in what order. Yes, there's quite a bit about the Rapture here, and the time just before the Rapture, as well as a lot of material about what remains left undone for those ""Left Behind"". The pictures available in the trade paperback edition help emphasize the warnings that Kirban gives to all of us. If you like the ""Left Behind"" books and want to understand how they really can occur, then I can recommend almost no better writer to start with than Salem Kirban."
5,Great product to protect your investment,"I recommend everyone with a video iPod buy this. It is excellent for protecting the screen, as well as the overall finish on the iPod. This is cheap insurance for a very pricey product."
1,great if you are 14,"Yeah if you are between 14-16 you should love this crap cause thats what exactly it is. They call themselves Nashville Pussy but they really should call themselves White Trash cause they are not much more then that. There is nothing complex here its just the way you would expect something when you were, well 14. Loud, no real meaning,and they are not really all that fun either so i dont get it, it looks like because they mention Sex that means they are good? Wrong, they suck bigtime and there is no talent here and they are not saying anything here that hasn't been already said many many times, save your money"
5,Art Practice & Text,"Its excellent, i love it, but try interpreting this in the practical middle brow range of actually doing something with it.Thats not a complain, thats an open ended challenge -- as I've been conjuring with little success for a couple of years: all thoughtswelcome!"
3,i--m--t,"Heath selected well for this volume, the essays flow well into one another and it proves to be quick reading.""Ethnocentric"" in the other review is laughable. Suppose it's not ethnocentric as long as one is biased for others, so long as it be against oneself. Cultural Marxists ought to be too busy putting their efforts against the State to have time to indulge in these sorts of things, ah, but they're far too busy earning tenure at a federally funded university to take note; they have had their sabbatical request approved by the Women's Studies department and are off to write that big diatribe against Religion and Intolerance and Poverty they've always dreamed of ever since they were a little fetus. So much invective, so little time!"
4,good,this cd is a good buy and you will be glad of your purchase. It has many artists which is nice because you don't have to listen to one artist
5,instrumental doesn't have to be boring,"Nice to hear a band that doesn't depend on vocals--this music is impressive of its own accord. Very entertaining album, with a little something for everyone--surf, jazz, blues, exotica...goes over great at parties. Excellent guitar work."
2,Buy the UK Import,"This release was to be hybrid SACD/CD (plays on both regular and super-audio CD players), and was indeed released as a SACD in the UK, but the US version only contains the ""regular"" CD version. The main draw for me to purchase a re-release of something I already own is enhanced sonic quality of the music or compelling alternative takes (not some silly video I'll only which once), and the US release misses the mark. I purchased the UK version (from Amazon UK) and I am very happy with it, and it is not much more expensive. US record companies take advantage of US consumers with habitually sub-standard product, so don't purchase it when there is a viable alternative in the UK version."
3,No te Confundas,"Aunuando en la publicacion de este item aparece que pertenece a la edicion de SACD/DVD, este no lo es, el disco CD no es hybrido y solo corresponde a la edicion sin ese plus. hay que conformarse con el DVD en el cual puedes apreciar el sonido multicanal."
2,Very disappointing,"Based on several reader reviews, I bought this album and ended up severely disappointed.In a nutshell, there are only two or three really good songs (especially, NEVER LET ME DOWN AGAIN) and the remaining tracks seem to be experiments in synthesizer sampling without any actual melody.Other than ""Contstruction Time Again"" this is probably the only other '80s DM release that I loathe. Much better alternatives to this album are ""Black Celebration"" and ""Some Great Reward."""
2,Music for the Masses???,"When I first time heard Never Let Me Down Again, I loved it.These days I am still loving it because it's one of DM's strongest and finest songs. It's really music for the masses!Strangelove the second best track and it has a great chorus. Sacred, Nothing and some other songs are good but the rest of the album sucks. I want you is a horrible song inclusing lover's sounds ( Please Gore,do it next time privately.) Remixs are torturing songs to jails. Listen thisalbum before you buy or you can have a great disappoinment in you DM-collection."
3,New fans start elsewhere...,"I've become a fan of DM recently upon hearing both Violator and Catching Up. Since then I've bought several albums and barring Songs of Faith and Devotion and their early albums (except Speak & Spell and People are People), which I have not heard, I would have to say that this one is my least favorite so far. The best tracks are Never Let Me Down, Behind the Wheel and Pimpf, but the rest don't really stand out. Wheras albums like Speak and Spell, Violator, and Ultra have sevaral standout singles and should have been singles, DMs middle period of Black Celebration and Music for the Masses produced more mediocrity than any other time in the band's history. This album is worth it for current DM fans, but new ones should start elsewhere, either with Violator or at the band's beginning with Speak and Spell. I did like the atmospheric ""Agent Orange"" that appears on the CD release, though."
3,Slightly sad title,"Worthy addition as continued evidence into their 80's electro-pop innovations & domination, it nonetheless took the dawning of a new decade to seal the groups musical validity for me, here still appearing a little too sterile, coarse, or pretentious for the most part. Aside for a song or two, the instrumentals may be the best work on here...not nearly the retro synth-salvation partial reputation suggests."
2,sometimes the truth hurts,"How this broke DM in the USA I will never figure. To my estimation, as a longtime fan and follower, there are 4 good songs on this 14 song cd, hardly what I would call a stellar average. To put it in perspective - better than A Broken Frame, but not as good as Some Great reward."

1,No SACD !!! Don't bother buying with this one...,"This US release was supposed to be like the UK release and include a hybrid SACD (Super Audio Compact Disc) as well as the DVD. It does not. The SACD has been replaced by a regular CD. Extremely disappointing ! I'll be purchasing the UK release instead...According to Mute's Head of Catalogue, David Rowntree, Mute commissioned Simon Heyworth's Super Audio Mastering facility to perform the critical re-mastering work for this album. Quote: ""The SA-CD versions take the sound to another level - the next best thing to being there!"". ""If you don't have an SA-CD player, DTS 96/24 is the next best thing.""He doesn't even mention the 44.1 kHz PCM audio of the CD version, which evidently, most of you are listening to.(A digital audio technology which is now 24 years old, by the way. Hey, maybe they will issue the US release on 8-track cartridge too)."
1,Buy the import version instead,"For whatever reason, Rhino decided to leave off the SACD layer of all three U.S. Depeche Mode re-releases, which is a real shame. If you have an SACD set-up, the audio quality of the import versions is noticeably better (especially on ""Speak & Spell""). Plus the DVD is region free, so the import video will still play in your PC or Mac (although it will not play on your TV, unless you have a DVD player that can convert PAL to NTSC). I highly recommend sending Rhino a message that selling watered-down versions in the U.S. is unacceptable, by purchasing the Mute label import version instead (all three of which are outstanding)."
5,"By far, the best Depeche Mode album","It contains the autentic Depeche sound, with the gratest songs they ever created. If you never heard any song of Depeche Mode, give a try to this amazing disc, and you will not be disappointed."
5,The Roots of Reiki,"This book is a ""must have"" as it takes the reader to the Shinto/Japanese spiritual roots of Reiki and where Reiki comes from. This book has become my Reiki bible and has deepened my practice. When you perform the exercises, as specified, the energy is undescrible and so very spiritual as it takes the participant to another place and space. If you purchase no other Reiki book this is the book to have."
5,Definitive guide to Reiki,"Whether you are new to Reiki energy or have been practicing for years, this book will give you the knowledge and awareness of a comprehensive approach to using Reiki for self healing. You will come to understand the true history of Reiki, and then move on to learn the various techniques used in Japanese Reiki which will allow you to deepen your practice. These techniques are rarely taught in Western courses, which are typically greatly abbreviated, and often filled with misinformation.Bronwen and Stiene have built a rock solid reputation for the accuracy and integrity of their work."
5,What Reiki is really all about!,"There is so much emphesus that Reiki is only about healing others, when in fact...""Reiki is about self-practice, self-responsibility and personal development.""This book takes you back in time to what reiki is on a personal level, and what Usui-sensei originally taught. Reiki was not meant to be of just ""palm healing"" only, becoming a Reiki master/teacher and just healing others, look inside yourself and listen, Reiki is all about ""you""!Get the book, read it and when you are done, read it AGAIN! There is no other book that can compare!"
3,*grin*,"So - the stamp is pretty cheaply made, but the important part is the stamp head, which is nice and clear ^^ It's just a cork-like thing, with the label printed on in kindof peely ink, and the stamp is a clear rubber disc stuck on the end, you can see the glue etc. But it serves it's purpose well :) The ink it comes with is pretty terrible, if you get your own water-resistant/oilbased kind it makes an attractive logo to put all over your stuff. Including draft assignments/diaries/research papers you like/friends notes in class/all these things. I'm a student, yeah!"
3,okay item,"The item has a cool symbol but there are many flaws. The wood stains easily, there is no cap and the ink that comes with the stamp is awful. If you take off the ring and purchase a new ink pad it becomes more practical and not as messy. However, none of those things would be an issue if the stamp had self inking properties"
3,"Ok, but my impression is that the absence of songs & ......","Ok, but my impression is that the lack of songs & limited activies tends to place this software in the mediocre camp. On the plus side: One activity allows the child to simply use the left or right side of the key board to play. Instructions or dialog can be skipped with a simple click of the mouse. The graphics are ok. Has up to 3 different levels. On the negative side: No songs! This is kind of lame for toddler (2-4) software. The clickable icons are also to small for some childern. As with almost all toddler software, childern are forced to do a lot of mouse clicking on small icons to play. I am only aware of ""Reader Rabbits Toddler"", having the foresight to eliminate this clicking problem. Some of the activites were too quickly mastered. This software also has a few problems running with a touchscreen."
2,A Politically Correct History of Africa,"One should expect the eigth volume of UNESCO's General History of Africa to be the most disappointing in the series. The previous volumes had shown the motive behind UNESCO's project was not so much to make a history of africa as to make a history africans should be proud of. That is one hard task to accomplish once you try and tackle with the post-colonial history of the continent. One can understand the focus on the struggle for independence, even though some of the chapters read tiring. It is the chapters on independent africa that simply are not honest history-making: terror, censorship and corruption in the new-born african nations does not figure in this book, the mad reveries of african socialism and personality-cult are politely brushed aside. This is not the history of africa as one can tell it today, it is an elaboration on the politically correct which does africans no favor."
3,No equalizer,Just a word of warning and stating the obvious for some.You will really miss the equalizer if you can piping from Pandora.
2,Disappointed,"I've had this amp for a few years and have been satisfied for most of the time, but it just quit working so ... now not so happy.I'm actually on my second one because the first one I received only worked for a week before failing. It was replaced under warranty and the second model worked fine for a few years.I've been using it to power several sets of speakers throughout the house. I recently moved some components around and after plugging everything back up the amp no longer worked. I checked the fuse and it was blown, so I replaced it but the new fuse blows as soon as I turn the amp on even though I don't have any inputs or speakers connected.So, now I'm shopping for a new amp."
1,amp,Dont buy this if you want good sound and power! worthless to me for my use! Didn't work worth a DAMN!
1,Piece of Junk!!!,"Upon the third use, I started having the same problem as all the other 1-star people. The problem is with the auto input line sensing circuitry. Even with the auto-sensing switch in manual, the auto-sensing circuitry engages and disengages after every dynamic passage on a center channel home theater setup. When it engages and disengages the sound coming from the speaker connected to the amp also engages and disengages. I just ordered the Niles Audio SI-2125 to replace this piece of junk. Thanks Amazon for picking up the return shipping!"
2,wanted to like it,I wanted to like it. The amp sounds good but it popped horribly every time it was turned on. It would also pop anytime anything else on the same circuit was powered on. Ended up returning it before it had the chance to blow my speakers.
4,"Nice features, but you get what you pay for","I liked the power rating and that it will turn on passively with an analog input (such as the stereo out from a flat screen TV). Shipment was lightening fast and packaging was top notch.Amazon has(d) it on sale for 80 bucks, so jumped on it. While the sound is tolerable it doesn't fit in with the quality of the rest of the system. So this will be relegated to anotherroom and I'll go for the Crown Amp like I should have in the first place."
1,functional but nasty click,"Works, but nasty click from the speakers when power on or off. What is the point of auto-on if you have to walk up to the box to turn up the volume afterwards? Company phone rings forever, so support is non existant. At least this amplifier is cheap, but of course there is a reason."
2,Didn't Last 30 days,It's a bummer as initially it worked amazingly well. Started to short out and ultimately failed quickly. Looking for a replacement and am not sure what that will be.
1,Caught on fire after about 24 hours of use.,"After setting up and testing for about 24 hours over a period of a week, it went up in smoke!.I hate to think what would have happened if I hadn't been there. In this age this should NEVER happen!"
2,burned up after touching it with my hand,purchased two of these. one unit worked good for about an hour the static electricity made it go up in flames. the second unit will only produce sound from the left or right channel at different levels. it will not balance out even with the balance nob.
5,nice amp!,"I hooked this up to my BOSE 301 series II speakers and it really works great! I first played my iPod 5g nano through this amp, and while the sound was clean I was a bit disappointed in the volume of sound, then I played my 4g ipod touch and BAM! Much better! Better amp in the 4g iPod touch. I've got PLENTY of volume, in fact more than I'll use. No need for a sub with these 301's as I don't listen to hiphop. The amp foot print is small, discreet, and free of choices, that's really a good thing! Additionally, I like Amazon, this company is always great to do internet business with, and are very smart moving forward in this new economy...down with ebay up with AMAZON!Oh yeah, sittin' here jammin to Ozric Tenticles ""Waterfall Cities"", and it's soundin' AWESOME!"
5,A great amp to use with iTunes and power backyard speakers,"I used this to power a pair of outdoor Bose speakers on my back deck and it works well. Runs cool; I have the AudioSource Amp installed in a closed kitchen cabinet with no heat problems.My music source is an Apple AirPort Express with Air Tunes (M9470LL/A) connected to the amp through an headphone jack splitter. All my music is stored on an XP PC in iTunes and streamed wirelessly to the Air Tunes box. I have the AirPort Express sound jack connected to two amplifier inputs; 1-a cheap $16 powered PC speaker set (has subwoofer) for listening in the kitchen (sounds great!), and 2 - this AudioSource amplifier. Music quality is good through the AudioSource Amp. I wish it had a bass boost but I think that is a problem with my Bose speakers.A great value."
5,"Excellent product, excellent price","I purchased this amp to power my outdoor speakers but it would also be great for a simple indoor system. Good,solid quality,excellent sound!! I would highly recommend."
3,Surround Amp,This is a very nice unit for the price.It is well made and has tremendous flexibility.I use it as part of my Home Theater system to drive my Surround Back speakers.The only negative I have is that when it is in Auto On mode it is a bit slow to respond. Leaving it on and idling works much better. It is well worth the money.
4,It Works !!!,"I did not expect much from this little amp but it works !!! Installed it for I pod connection for four speakers in ocean front home in Mexico. With salt air, I did not expect it to last long, like most electronics down there, but it has been cranking for over two years. When it stops working, I will get another one. Think of it as the Keenex of amps............................$75"
3,basic,"Just needed something affordable to power a couple bookshelf speakers, and this fits the bill. I'm disappointed with the dual input auto-switching, which essentially doesn't work, so I got a manual input switch for like four bucks. As far as sound quality it seems pretty good."
4,good amp,"I wanted an amp to play MP-3 music, and this is perfect----simple, easy to hook up, and good quality sound thru my fairly inexpensive speakers.No complaints."
4,AudioSource Amp 100 2-Channel Power Amplifier,"I like this product. It's low profile and a great value. I connected a radio and cd player to it. The radio should kick out automatically once the CD player starts. My only minor complaint is the radio doesn't kick out until the sound output from the CD is high enough. I once played a CD that has a very quiet passage at the beginning, it didn't switch over until it got louder. If you are just looking for a great amp that you technically declined spouse or significant other can't comprehend, this is the amp for you. The auto power feature on is great. The sound is very clean and faithful. I do wish it had a subwoofer out. That would make it perfect for me."
2,i have question,"i was wondering if anyone else who has purchased this amp is having the same problem as me. i am using an old advent 300 as the pre-amp. the souce is either a laptop or mp3 player. at the beginning of a song or when the music is slightly muted the amp kicks off, the music stops. it's very irritating because it give the music a halting quality. when it's picking up the music it sounds great....but i can't listen to it when it's doing this. i am not an audiphile so it maybe something in the setup but it seemed pretty straight forward. thanks for any input."
4,"Good Product, Poor Documentation","This is a great product saddled with unclear instructions.The single biggest thing to note about this amp is:Input 1 is signal sensing. If you connect a source in this input that has quiet passages (like classical music), it will turn itself on and off resulting in an audible ""click"". This was made so it can turn itself on when it senses a signal is completely normal. So, if you plan on using it as an amp, you have one ""always on"" input. Other than that, it's a nice sounding amp for not a lot of money."
5,Works great for surround amp,"Using as the amp for surround back channels, sounds good, running cool. Would suggest this for anyone needing auxiliary amp."
3,Aux amp,"Ok to power small bookshelf speakers , not much bass. Basic amp for private listening areas. Worth the $$$ invested"
4,Great item off to a slow start,"The directions for installation were very sparse and it took some time and a few mistakes to set up, even though the final setup is quite simple. But once it was up and running, it worked excellently."
4,Audio Source AMP-100 Stereo Power Amplifier,"This is a fine item with no flaws whatsoever. It has been received as represented by the seller and is in new condition. My only problem has been with its description in the online presentationwhich needed a more thorough exposition, The failure with this item has been all mine due to mytoo cursury search of its attributes. This seller is blameless here, and performed his role admirably and excellently.Respectfully,Courtenay J. Walker"
1,This is junk,"This AMP is junk. First one burnt out within 2 weeks of running a pair of 8"" Audiosource ceiling speakers. Audiosource seems good so far, replace the first bad unit. Got the second one, smoked the second day. Same scenario - running background music in small house.Potential fire hazard, as it not only blows the fuse, but also heats up and smokes inside.Look elsewhere."
2,Take a pass on this one,"We have two reference systems in the home plus digital or analog over ethernet feeds to all of the other rooms. Speakers tend to be high end, source material ranges from digital music fed to dac's or cd's. I have two AudioSource 100's, one in the kitchen driving Energy's and one that drives a set of B&W;'s on the porch.Totally devoid of musicality. This amp will kill any source signal you put in it. Compared to any amp we've had in the past 40 years, this is the worst. The sound has nothing going for it, 0 energy, no low end, sounds like it compresses music, no soundstage, no rhythm, just plain boring."
4,Works very well,"I have a whole-house sound entertainment system, which includes a pair of speakers in the dining room, a pair of speakers in the living room, and a pair of speakers in the bedroom. I have a AirportExpress connected directly to this unit, and it has no problem powering all six pairs of in-ceiling speakers. In fact, this unit is so powerful, I cannot turn the volume up beyond the midpoint because I fear that my windows will break. An excellent product for the price.Note: This unit has a single RCA output, so make sure you use a splitter if you intend to connect multiple pairs of speakers to this amplifier."
3,Sounds good but problem with line in 1,"Worked fine for just over a month and now music constantly goes on and off. Would return it if under 30 days!Updated review -- problem appears to be with line 1 which triggers the auto on/off. That didn't work for me, sound cut in and out, but when switched to input 2 problem ended."
2,Gate Problems,"Buy a different amplifier! I bought this because of the price and the output, but it has one feature that makes it so unbelievably annoying that I'm glad to be rid of it. It has a gate on it that is suppose to automatically switch between inputs. The way its suppose to work is if you have two inputs it will automatically switch to the one carrying the signal. Instead of working the way it should it automatically shuts off once the input level gets low, causing a clicking that cuts out the quietest parts of your music. During a fade in or out it just cuts out! If you're constantly using a high output device this might work for you, but anything less and this amp is no good."
4,great bargain if your power needs are modest,"My need was to drive extra speakers satellite in two different rooms. It works fine for that purpose but barely. Driving 2 pair of 8"" 8 ohm ceiling speakers"" wired in parallel with impedance matching volume controls takes about all this amp can put out. Sounds fine and works ok but volume control is set close to max. Frustrating that it shuts down if signal level drops (between selections, etc) but instructions give the work around to prevent it. For the price it is a real bargain but if you need some power think about the next level up."
1,WARNING - caught fire!,"Wow, pinch me is it really 2011 and we still have consumer electronics catching fire? Where is CE, UL, BS when you need them?Fortuitously I was next to the amp when the wisps of smoke started, followed by a crackling fire. The amp as spec'ed is decent and worked fine - until it decided to self-combust. The real concern is that this is configured as an 'auto-on' device, so it switches itself on when it receives an audio signal on the line-in: this means it is often going to be put somewhere out of the way and unnoticed - and that makes it a REAL fire hazard (as in 'burning the house down' hazard).So if i could give is a zero or negative star it would be duly awarded. Since now at least three reviews have indicated there is a real fire hazard, Amazon need to look carefully at what they are offering."
1,"Horrible Audio, No Teaching","These other reviewers are kidding you.There are significant problems with this dvd.1. The audio on this dvd is horrible. It sounds like they are talking and singing through a tube. I could have done better in my garage.2. The tracks are: all the singing and stories in english, or the same program in Mandarin. There is no teaching whatsoever.I realize there are not many dvd's for teaching children Mandarin, however there are a few better than this."
5,Making the Invisible Visible by Keith Devlin,What a wonderful book. You just have to read it and then you will understand.
4,Math book,My son asked for this book for Christmas. He is a Math teacher. I haven't given it to him yet
1,The author lack of knowledge about mathematical history,The author reviews mathematical history but mentions no India nor China. He presented a biased view of mathematical history.The books is misleading in that regard.
2,Too difficult,"For trying to be a popular exposition on mathematics Devlin's book is too difficult for the lay reader. Unless you have university level mathematics in your luggage you won't understand much. The explanations of basic conepts are missing, the proofs are not there and the history is condensed into a few pages. Thus if your mathematical imagination cannot fill in these gaps you will not extract much pleasure from this book. You will rather be frustrated. I myself have read mathematics at the university and still couldn't follow him everywhere. The problem is that the labeling of the book is misleading. This is not a book of popularized mathematics. This is leizure time reading for mathematics professors and math-freaks. If you want to read something that is easy to understand but still interesting try some of the American Mathematical Society's wonderful publications (you can find them all on amazon)."
2,Not good unless you have a good knowledge of math,"I'm not a math cripple but I will admit that I have not always been that great when it comes to math. I have recently grown a hunger for science in general, ( including mathematics of course) and thought I should look for a book to help me grasp math from another perspective. I actually read many of the pages in the book and while I did understand the first couple pages , I found myself lost as I continue reading. As another reviewer mentioned , this is not a book for the layman. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who is not that good at math. I guess I'll just keep looking elsewhere to find books on the subject that will help me on my journey to become better at math."
2,not for the beginner,"I started reading the book and will have to stop and learn mathematical notation and some terminology first . I'm hopeful the infomation is correct , but it is over my curious head at the moment ."
4,A Beautiful Read,A beautiful read. And I mean beautiful. As I read I could envision see the beauty in the patterns being described. It is both history and description. I would definitely recommend this book.
2,low budget cheap 90's film of pregnancy,"3 or 4 college buds all court the same row captain and then she becomes pregnant///focuses all around the bar and their goofiness...when word comes out she has a kid, they all rush, not knowing who is the dad and they all step up - but it is pretty playful and not realistic."
4,Fun Way to Pass an Afternoon,"I thought this movie was super cute. Some of the plot points were a little fuzzy, but as far as romantic comedies go, it was fun. Gabrielle Anwar is great, and Sean Astin was pretty fun. I didn't realize that one of the guys is Smith from Sex and the City, so that made it even better! ;)"
3,Great quality but too small,The shorts look great but they were too tight. I wear a 38 in every denim jeans and shorts I wear and non of them have ever been tight. Be wary of the size.
4,Not a relaxed fit.,"The overall quality is good, but the fit is tight. If you want a relaxed fit, these may not be to your liking."
3,Strange fit.,"I got Dickies in men because I thought they would fit better than women size. Strangely, the fit is snug in the hip area but comfortable in the waist and thighs. I tried one size up but they were too full. I gave them to a friend's husband who said they were his size. But he said they were too snug for him in the rise. So I wear them, though constantly pulling them up."
2,NOT FOR CYCLING OR DANCE OR FREE WEIGHTS,"""DO NOT USE WHEN BICYCLING."" This is printed on the back of the MF-180 package. This gadget is intended ONLY for JOGGING & WALKING. Inside the user manual it further states that this monitor WILL NOT give accurate measurements for any exercise that requires gripping or ""excessive hand movements"".Additional limitations: if you have dry skin or cold hands the readings will not be accurate. The technology behind this gadget is limited to very specific conditions.For me that meant that the bulk of my exercise routine of which includes bicycling, aerobic classes, free weights and Nautilus type machines. I should have picked up on that from the other reviewers and their comments about keeping the finger in a particular position. I will continue with the chest belt."
1,looks good but doesnt work as great,"the monitor looks really cool on the hand while cycling or at the gym... however due to its design, it does not provide accurate readings. the finger has to be in a specific position with the sensor and that too without movement if it has to be anywhere close to accurate. I'm going to stick with the chest strap for accurate readings."
4,Comfortable to use,I've only recently started using this product to monitor my heart rate and am still in the learning process of how to use the produce efficiently. It has so many things that it can keep track of. I find it to be rather comfortable to use. It monitors my heart rate in % which helps me to stay within my range. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking to get away from those chest strap monitors.
2,limited usefulness,"This will require a large mitten in colder weather.This does not appear to use electrical impulse.This will require more adapting to than you might think.When working, it is accurate."
2,"If Ana loved it, I should too.","I didn't. This seemed so slow and plodding to me. I understand that this was a ""page turner"" when it was written. I understand that this is literature. I think it must be my instant gratification gene. I watched the movie. I am sure I missed tons of literary illuminations about character and plot, but I simply couldn't force myself to finish this book. This says more about me though than the author."
4,Embellished history worth reading,The author follows the main story of the Scripture passage with imaginative characters and possible cultural embellishments. An easy and enjoyable book with good life lessons in principle.
5,"This is not a Christian book, King Hezekiah is Jewish!!!!!!!!!!!","Thought this book was great. Well written, I could not stop reading.My only issue is with a lot of the other reviews that say this is a Christian book. It is not, Google King Hezekiah and learn that he is of the House of David and Jewish. For those reading that he is of the genealogy of Jesus and assuming he is Christian is forgetting that Jesus himself was Jewish.Sorry for my little rant but please know what you are reading."
5,Makes you want to read your Bible,"I really enjoyed this book. It was exciting and interesting. I'm fairly familiar with my Bible, but this book had me wanting to check and double check things. I'd find myself reading my Bible to see how the story was going to go! My teenage daughter read it first and said she thought I'd like it. She was right! I recommended it to my teenage son and he was on book 2 within a couple days. You just don't want to put it down!I like it when a book can bring a Bible story to life without contradicting the Bible itself. I'm on the 3rd book so far and still loving it!"
2,"Great story, excellent writing, poorly edited.","Like so many other people who have read Lynn Austin's Gods and Kings, I appreciated her fine writing skills and excellent story telling ability. However, her editors must have struggled with the manuscript translation to ebook style. There were so many lines that did not separate into paragraphs, punctuation problems, words not separated or separated words when not needed, and words run together, that at times it was difficult to read. I can't believe that Bethany House would release a script with this many errors in it. An author of this caliber deserves a better production than this gobblygook."
5,Gods & Kings by Lynn Austin,"I wish I could give this book 10 stars. Lynn Austin is a fabulous author and her writing is scripturally sound. Once you start this book, you don't want to put it down until you have read the 5 books in this series. I highly recommend this book and have bought several as gifts for my friends."
4,Powerful,Austin brings to life a part of the gospel many wish to skip over. The horror of idolatry is described in ways many refuse to visualize because of the horror that is involved. This is a wonderful portrayal of this dark time in Israel's history and the beginning of the glorious rising out of the darkness of sin.
4,Gods and Kings by Lynn Austen,This is an exciting book to read. The story of God's protection of Hezikiah from his youth. Full of political intrigue it takes places in a dangerous time for Israel both physically and spiritually. The suspense and horror in the book grabs the reader. I will try other books in this series.
5,Hallelujah!,"This was the first in the series, and i was ""hooked"" until I finished book#5. Amazing Bible based fiction. I was so encouraged when I saw the characters ""come to life"" with Ms. Autens' literary skills. Recommend all five as a very good read and study."
3,Worth Reading to Better Know this Period,"Gods and Kings is a good book for gaining insight into the politics of kings and priests in the years after David took rule. Austin does a good job of telling us how it could have happened. It's also nice to see how prophets could have influence on both the courts and people.I like stories to be more descriptive than this, one but Gods and Kings does help this Old Testament period come alive."
5,Brings Biblical historical events to life.,This is an excellent historical novel and keeps the reader engaged to the end. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in putting a face on early Biblical historical characters.
2,God's and kings,This is a very needed message for the children of God today. Do not give in to temptation as it will multiply and lead you on a path away from God.
1,God's and Kings: Chronicles of the Kings #1,This was a great book to read. I had a hard time putting it down! Can not wait to read the next one!
5,A-maz-ing!,"I purchased this book for my Kindle app-- mostly b/c it was free. HOWEVER! Once I started reading it, I couldn't stop! In fact, I read the entire series in a week. I know others have said this-- there are a few typos (not really a ""big deal"" in my opinion ;) ), but the book is so well written. I gained a wonderful insight to biblical history in a way that I've never had before. READ THIS BOOK! :) And go ahead and get the rest of the series, too, while you're at it..."
5,The Bible comes alive,"Although this is fiction, it is an interesting way to present what the Bible says about Ahaz and Hezekiah. This book follows Hezekiah from childhood. It is so intriguing. I loved every page. Lynn Austin brings the characters in the Bible alive and makes them so real. I found myself searching the scripture to see what the Bible actually says about what happens during this time. As soon as I finished the book I was downloading the next one in the series.I totally recommend this book. It is a terrific read!"
4,Need of New Editors!,"I love to read Bible stories in the fictional form. They add life to the old stories we've heard so often. This book does a great job in telling us the story of the ancient kings. I've read other reviews, and they speak of many typos. Well, in the Kindle edition, they may have corrected some, but they missed quite a few in chapters 18 and 19. Because I am a student of the Bible, I found some of the repetition somewhat tedious. It was still an enjoyable read. I wonder if we could get the rest of the books in the series for free when we find typos in them."
4,"I really, really liked this book","Although familiar with the Old Testament, this particular story is not one with a lot of detail, or often retold. So...the culture was familiar only in a vague way. I really liked the way the author took the few facts from the Bible and constructed a compelling story. I enjoyed it very much!"
4,Great Christian fiction,Lynn Austin beautifully combined the historical facts of Hezekiah's reign with her imagination of how one event may have led to the other. I was constantly looking at my Bible to be sure the scripture references were correct; they were!
5,Fabulous,"This was the first Lynn Austin book I read, and I could not put it down. I quickly read the following books in this series. This first one started out difficult to read, simply because of the subject matter, and almost a year after I read it I still think about it from time to time. Even if you are not a fan of Biblical fiction, I would still highly suggest this book. Well done, Lynn Austin!"
5,Exciting!,"This novel grabbed by interest from the very beginning and held it to the last word. Gods and Kings is a beautifully written action packed story. I recommend it to anyone interested in history, religion, action.... its a great read!"
5,Riveting!,I read this book in a day. Couldn't put it down. Just purchased the next book and will start It as soon as i get some sleep!
4,Exciting read,I really have enjoyed this book for it's amazing details that bring the listed bible scriptures to life. The research that was used makes it more credible as I also go back and read those verses in my own bible.
3,Good book but tons of typos,This book is really interesting and well written but there are so many typos. Some are just missing punctuation that are easy to over look but there are also words missing in some paragraphs that are really frustrating and confusing. It really disrupts the flow of the book. I'd love to read the rest of the series but I hesitate to pay money for such poor quality. I'm glad this one was free. I reported the errors so hopefully they will look into it because this is a really good book.
5,Great Read on HIstory of Israel,"Downloaded 2nd book as soon as i finished this one, that should tell how i felt about this book.Would recommend it to anyone who has an interest in the history of Israel and enjoys a good story."
4,Gods & Kings Book,"A very good book based on facts from the Bible. The facts are taken from several books: Chronicles, Isaiah, Michah and Kings. I thought the author did a great job of filling the missing pieces to make a great story."
5,Great Book!,"I loved this book, did not want to put it down. I really enjoy Francine Rivers books and this was very comparable to her series ""Women of the Bible"". Can't wait to read more!!!"
5,Going Back in Time,"Lynn Austin has done an amazing job with Gods & Kings. She has breathed life into her characters: wicked King Ahaz, his son Hezekiah, Shebna, and all the others. I was there, watching this cast of characters become living, breathing, human beings who were not just names in the Bible. I felt their pain, their sorrow, and their joy. You won't be able to quit reading until you've read the entire series. God has gifted Austin with an amazing writing ability."
5,AWESOME STORY!!!,"I loved this book so much that I read it straight through! And then I read the rest of them in succession. Austin is a great author, bringing the Biblical characters alive in a way I'd never imagined. This book series will expand your understanding of this Old Testament story of Hezekiah, and it is fascinating!"
3,Okay,I did not do well with the beginning chapters. But once I got into the 6th or 7th chapter it got better. But I still have not finished it. It lost my attention.
5,My favorite read!,"Lynn Austin's books are ALL great but this series is my most favorite. It's exciting, scary, sad and biblical even though it is fictional. In fact, it drives you to the Bible to check out her historical facts. I felt all the emotions that the characters felt. I wish she would write more biblical fiction. She makes it all come alive!"
4,God's and Kings:Chronicles of the Kings,A very interesting read. The historical content was excellent as it came to life. I could not wait to see what would happen next. Makes you reflect on what values are really important to you and how easily you can be sidetracked and never get back to the place you should be in some instances. On the other hand with some perseverance you can get back on track and be in good standing.
4,Engrossing read,"AFter reading this, I had to search the Old Testament for the story of Hezekiah, Ahaz, and Isaiah. Very entertaining read. Can't wait to read the next one."
2,Lackluster story telling,"Not very pleasant to read. Author's dialogue and third party passages were dull. I didn't finish it. About 1/2 way through, I deleted it."
5,great book,Lynn Austin is my new favorite author. I really like the way she writes her books. So far I have read 3 of her books and they are all good ones.
3,Gods and Kings,It was okay. It was slow moving and repetitious. I heard great reviews about it so maybe it was just me.
3,Tateranne,This was not the book I had expected when I down loaded it but Anyone that has any knowledge of the Bible and Its documented history of the Kings of IsraelWill enjoy following this series. Its mainly about Heziekial who grows up to be king of israel and how he outsmarts his enemys and brings peace to his peopleIts a harsh life with harsh outcomes at times but well worth reading if only to realise how history influences modern living
5,Riviting!,I could not put this down. The story put biblical events to life and kept me on the edge of my seat. This is a must read! Can't wait to start the next in the series...
5,awesome book,"Excellent book. Very vivid imagery through details. Lynn Austin is definitely on my list of authors I like now. Pick this up and read it, it's a must!"
5,Nobody beats Klausz as a woodworking instructor,"This was the first of 5 DVDs I bought of Frank Klausz. So, in a real way this is a review of his videos as a group, besides this one on hand tools. Klausz is always clear and precise. He demonstrates speed in addition to craftsmanship. Be sure to buy his DVD on dovetails and mortise and tenon joints to see Frank further demonstrate hand tools achieving wonderful results. See him use hand tools as an extension of power tool use.Since I first viewed this DVD I have added to my woodworking addiction by more frequently visiting estate sales/flea markets buying old, rusted tools in order to rehab them. This is terribly satisfying work, and my friends and son-in-law really like the vintage gifts that result.When I buy a DVD, such as this one, I figure 3 or 4 good ideas make the Amazon price for the DVD worth the investment. Frank Klausz always provides more than that."
2,Not great,"Granted I'm looking at a different edition (one illustrated by Kevin Marks) to write these comments. I think the book is very average. It's ok, much the same as many other books on the same subject (menstruation for girls entering puberty). I'm still looking for a book that is better than just average."
1,Overrated,"One would think that when spending nearly $200 that is claimed for a book that is claimed to be the be all and end of all courses on its subject it would have at the very least been carefully edited. What you get are two looseleafs into which you insert several hundred typed pages that are replete with spelling and grammatical errors. And, while there is useable material here, you are paying $197 for a thinly veiled manual of huckstering numerous software programs which either pay Internet Market Center commissions or that they own outright. Much of this software is buggy, troublesome and poorly supported, and for the most part much better can be found elsewhere. Same for this so-called course. There is much better out there for much less. Among the numerous worthwhile sources of material are Webonomics, and Make Your Site Sell. Avoid this one despite what IMC's shills want you to believe with their rave reviews."
1,a manual on how to rip people off,"other people have noted the weird presentation with looseleaf binders you have to put together yourself.other people have noted that the information is out of date.other people have noted that mainly this product just tried to sell you buggy software.other people have noted that part of the package is a spammer's manual.other people have noted that corey rudl spends more time bragging about all the money he has made than anything else.they are all right. this program is a manual for dishonesty, badly written and poorly edited.don't make corey any more money.i made the mistake. i think you will shortly find my copy up here to buy."
1,Totally crap,This book and his website is totally crap.He teach samp technique which annoy any serious customer.He keep saying about how he make millions of dollar.I think he is lying. He's website look like the one designed by secondary school boy
1,Did Nothing,I have no idea what all these reviews for this brand of dieters tea are talking about. I followed the directions nothing happened. Brewed a stronger cup-still nothing.Even measured out the water to 6oz and let the tea bag seep for five minutes-nothing just stronger tasting tea. On the box it tells you not to drink more than 1 cup in a 24 hour period- I drank three the other day not even thinking about it and nothing happened! Just tasted like cranberry tea and nothing else. Strange.
1,Tastes like sweaty gym socks,"I bought this product based off reviews saying it tastes great and I was extremely disappointed. As soon as I started steeping it this smell filled my kitchen (my daughter even asked what the horrible smell was). Sadly, it was this tea. I tried it and it tastes like sweaty socks also. It is so gross. I have tried adding honey, drinking it cold, drinking it hot, etc and they all taste horrible. As far as a diet aid, I don't think so. I guess if you had a lot of excrement in you, possibly. I even doubled the suggested amount and I still did not anything happen (and no, I was not on the toilet a lot either). All in all, this product was a big thumbs down to me."
4,Keeps me on track,"I love this product, it helps keep things moving! I use it twice a day afternoon and evening while dieting. A great product for helping maintain your weight."
3,Wasted a lot of good tea.,I love the tea and have bought it before but this new packaging has teabags so thin that they explode. I am very disappointed.
1,really disappointed,"though i did not purchase this through amazon, i did get this recently from thw grocery store, and have to admit im really disappointed. i followed the instructions the first evening EXACTLY as instructed with the included paper, and no results. the second day, i brewed just a little longer, still no luck, (basing this off some other comments from other users here on amazon) then today i only did 6oz, not 12 as the paper instructs, and even brewed this for 6 minutes. still nothing.i really wanted this to work for me like it has for others, i had heard good things and was so excited, but still no luck. i guess im one of those people this doesnt affect. ill keep trying it daily till i run out, but looks like ill have to try something else.as for taste, its not bad. just tastes like tea leaves, not deliciously fantastic, but not nose-pinchingly undrinkable. good luck to anyone else. hope you have more success with this than i did"
3,its ok,i got this tea hoping it would be better than my dieters delight china slim tea but it isnt. it does make you use the bathroom but not enough for you to feel cleansed for that particular day...i have no choice but to finish thus package but i will be going back to my regular tea afterwards
5,Tea that works to clear all digestive stoppage.,"This tea works on my fiance's digestive track as she has an issue with colitis and this product along with essential enzymes helps her to absorb and digest foods that otherwise would give her pains while in her digestive track, Thank you for making this product we plan to continue using it as long as we can."
4,Basically a laxative...,"I never drink this tea alone. I always steep it with another tea, such as Oolong or Jasmine because the taste isn't the best. I use honey and sugar to sweeten and down the hatch it goes! Expect some, um, gastrointestinal responses the next day. Sometimes I feel a bit of cramping and sometimes I don't. Sometimes it will take most of the next day for it to 'work'...and sometimes it won't!!"
5,The BEST Cinnamon Tea,"This is far and away the best cinnamon tea I have ever found. It's quite difficult to find a cinnamon tea without added flavors like apple. This is just cinnamon tea, and it's aroma and taste is that of fresh cinnamon. Also I drink this after dinner to curb my carb cravings, and amazingly, it does the trick."
2,Agatha Raisin and the Novel from Hell,"I've followed the Agatha Raisin series since it began. It is accepted that Beaton's mysteries are somewhat short on ""mystery"" leaving her hopefully endearing characters to carry the interest in the narratives. As a result, it is harder to accept that after eleven installments, Agatha has not grown as a character nor as an amateur sleuth. In this latest novel, ""Agatha Raisin and the Love from Hell,"" Agatha has been stripped of whatever comedic touches she initially possessed. In the place of a gentle wryness about herself has mushroomed a seething hair-trigger temper that leads her to awkward outbursts, making her a very unsympathetic heroine. Perhaps the story is meant to illustrate that pursuit of an ill-fated love affair can distort or poison one's nature. I hope in the next installment that Agatha might revert to her former eccentric, more lovable, self. I hope so -- and in a mystery worthy of her."
2,too many typos,"I love this series and would have enjoyed this one much more if it wasn't so full of typing errors, I don""t see anyone else complaining about this so maybe it's just my kindle. Did anyone else have a problem with this?"
1,Another mystery series in decline,"This will be my last M.C. Beaton mystery. Maybe the author is burned out and no longer has the energy to set up a scene (description of how the character got to that scene, what was the weather like, the set up that makes the reader feel he's right there with that character). This lack of atmosphere/setting seems to be very similar to Lilian Jackson Braun's latest books. I can deal with sloppy proofreading (not too happily) but I'd sure like to have some help in mentally picturing the characters moving about instead of reading mostly dialogue. I agree with many of the other reviews in that it's also a shame that Agatha has not developed one bit and that a lot of the humor has been replaced with nastiness. My suggestion to anyone who has not read an M.C. Beaton book (either the Hamish or Agatha series) is to start at the beginning and enjoy her earlier works."
5,Great,M.C. Beaton is my favorite author - I have all of her books - I so enjoy Agatha and her exploits - please write more
4,Typical Agatha,"M.C. Beaton can't be beat for the cozy mystery and Agatha Raisin is so much fun. she's 50-ish, stout, and has bearlike eyes. Moreover she's human -- vain, silly, romantic. She's also smart and sassy and independent. Love from Hell is another in a long series of Agatha mysteries, and reads are good as the first ones."
4,Favorita in Japan,"I was a bit put off in the beginning with the poor quality of the DVD, the picture seemed to be grainy. The theater was very dark and you saw very little of the orchestra or the conductor. But when the singers 'warmed up' you were impressed with the voices. Donizetti's music, as always is so melodic you can close your eyes, sit back and soar! The audience was enthusiastic in their applause, prolonged ovations; Leonora was visibly moved to tears after the ovation for one of her arias. The cast was excellant, choreography for ballet scene was superb. I was only slightly disappointed with the set direction and the quality of the filming of the DVD."
4,Great performance..... terrible DVD,"Yes, a great performance, the music was beautiful but the quality of the DVD leaves a lot to be desired, the image was blurry and at times looked washed out and the intrusion of the prompter at times drove me to anger, but in spite of everything I am glad that I saw this performance and added it to my collection.Just the joy of hearing Cossotto, Kraus and Raimondi in their prime is worth the price of this item.Warts and all, I highly recommend it.If you are an opera lover you'll enjoy this rarely performed opera."
3,Buy it to see and hear Alfredo Kraus,I bought this recently and just watched it. The picture quality is horrible. You cannot see anyone in the orchestra since the picture is dark and grainy. The sound is surprisingly excellent and in stereo. The orchestra is very good. The singing is top notch although Bruscantini was far below expectations. Cossotto was a pleasure and a very young Raimondi who was made up to look very old was terrific. But what makes this DVD a good buy is the opportunity to hear and see Alfredo Kraus. One of the top tenors in my lifetime he is at his best in this opera. Only the graininess and darkness of the picture brings my rating of this down to a three.
4,La Favorita,"By far the best recording I have seen of this, one of Donizetti's most famous operas. Alfredo Kraus sings an especially fine Fernando."
1,Much duller than I had predicted,"The journal of a monk, Matthew Perry, was preserved, translated,and chopped up. Some pieces were then placed in a book for publication. Disjointed, obscure in many instances and almost impossible to read without a reference library close at hand, The Illustrated Chronicles.., is a chore to comprehend with little reward for your effort. Advertised as some kind of entertaining historical memoir, it is anything but. Not for most and definetely not for me."
2,Not much here,"Beware this album - it's pretty much just pop in a boring spectrum of forgettable melodies and very thin, lyrically. There are a few more traditionally-rooted tracks that exhibit some of the rich, emotional harmonies and inventive beats that are responsible for the rise of African music, but they don't justify the purchase.There's probably several hundred pop titles out there that bear as much weight as this fluffy. Definitely not one to light up a party. If this one makes it to someone's Desert Island Collection, I'd rather drown..."
5,"Out of print, but excellent","Five faces of darkness is almost as good as the original movie. While lacking the print quality of the original, it is excellent in content. Appearences by Trypticon amoung others, is very interesting to the dearest of fans. It's all here, the origen, and many other interesting stories. Although this cinematic masterpiece is no longer published, I wish it were, having watched it. AJauasataian, a awesome transformer also makes an appearance."
4,You should have seen this already...,"This is just Five Faces Of Darkness, the five part third season premier from the original Transformers TV show. If you grew up back then, like me, then you should have already seen this yourself back in the day. If you didn't, or you're new to G1 shows, this is ok but not essential to your enjoying The Transformers: The Movie. The F.H.E. Video of these episodes has been available for rent at my local ... for years & years. Since it's not likely to be available here, check your ... or, better yet, go to ..., check out the CTLP and get your episodes on VHS from one of the many video traders/sellers who have many if not all G1 episodes on tape. That's what I did for the episodes I wanted that haven't been released by Rhino Video yet."
3,it was okay,i dont understand how the guy who wrote the Dark Knight Returns could suck so much at writing storys about freaking RoboCop i mean the possibilities are incredible but 2 and 3's plots were so mediocre. Burke was an excellent replacement he looked great acted great and sounded pretty damn close so i give him credit but i just wish the stories were better. the one thing i was glad about was the return of the classic robocop theme i was pissed that kershner didnt use it i mean that theme IS robocop but yeah 3 isnt bad at all but could have been so much more.
2,NOT GREAT BUT NOT HORRIBLE! NOT GORY EITHER!,"This wasn't that great a movie, this is an examble of a stinkier sequel. This movie though is a lot less gorier than the original two. This movie did have some hilarios and cool moments and humor, I like some of the movie even though the story wasn't thaaat good. So it's OK if you like Robocop movies. Get the popcorn and pepsi it's starting."
2,Looks more a less like an addvertisement for toys,"This one looks like a childrens super hero atmosphere, because the writter of this one thought that kids would want to see it instead of grownups. Unfortunately this one was a box office flop."
1,[not good]!,"What happened? I thought the first two were classics but this was just plain [not good]. RoboCop's fight with the samurai toward the end was OK, but did not save this movie from being terrible. If you want something real entertaining then pick up Die Hard, all the James Bond films, both Terminator films and the first two RoboCop films. They are more worth your time and money than this."
1,Just Plain Awful,"The first and second Robocop films were great. I loved the over-the-top action and humor elements in both films.Robocop 3 is a pure, unadulterated disaster. First off, it is way too tame (a PG-13 rating??!!). Second, the ""plot"" is completely ruined by the introduction of the ""cute little kid who is a computer whiz"" character, what a travesty! Third, the movie is actually boring; a boring Robocop movie! I could go on and on, but why bother.They dare to put this garbage on DVD?"
2,This movie dropped !,Come on ! Rated PG-13 !? This is why the movie was stupid ! They made Robocop act funny and dumb. What happened to Peter Weller the orginal Robocop !? The story in this movie is lame but the only credit I give this movie is the fact that Robo has the new weapon which connects to his hand and the flight pack.
2,What happened to the violence?,what went wrong with Robocop? The first two are violent and watchable but this one is a disappoint and is only entertaining to a point.
2,"Worst of the three, but gives alittle hope for a better film","This was the worst of three movies, because of how they messed with the violence, and made the movie PG-13. What made the first two movies good was the great gore that made them feel more realistic then what was presernted here. Here there is no gore, but very little action scenes with almost no physical violence at all. This was the worst mistake that Orion made, because as a result this movie flopped with just 10 million at the box office after being shelved for two years, and took down the entire studio with it. Peter Weller should've been in this movie, because it would've been alot better movie. Some people say that this movie is better than Robocop 2, because it has less violence, and focuses more on the story which is true as it does so, but overall this movie is nothing more than a major disappointment."
1,Junk,"When a movie has dialogue like, ""I thought your ninja was supposed to take care of RoboCop!"", it ain't gonna be Citizen Kane. It won't even be a good RoboCop movie. But if you must indulge, look for the strings holding up RoboCop when he flies. Yes, I said look for the strings holding up RoboCop when he flies."
4,"Watered down Robocop,Robo Ninja","Robocop 3 was released in 1993.The rating is pg-13.Peter Weller is replaced by Robert John Burke(Safe,Limitless).The movie is directed by Fred Dekker(Ricochet),written by Frank Miller.Robocop 3 stars Remy Ryan(Monkey Trouble),Rip Torn(Men In Black,Extreme Prejudice),CCH Pounder(Face Off,Avatar),Mako(Pearl Harbor,Conan the Barbarian),John Castle(Gods and Generals).Omni Consumer Products OCP have created a new armed forces known as the Urban Rehabilitators and call themselves rehabs.They are leaded by Paul McDagget (John Castle).They have better weapons and are more trained than the Detroit Police.They are mostly to kick out the remaining residents of Cadillac Heights and other areas.There is an underground resistance of civilians which the rehabs are tracking down."
1,Robocop 3- Protect the innocent from this movie!!,"""Ahh finally, robocop 3"" was the first thought that popped up in my mind as I sat down in my room to watch the movie. I loved the two first movies (Peter Weller is awsome as Murphy/Robocop) and I was really excited to see him in action again, wearing the metal plated armour suit... But wait a minute? What is this? No Peter Weller? Damn, well hope I live through this... I barely came out alive of my room that night...This is perhaps one of (maybe the worst) ""3rd movie in a series of good movies""-films I have ever encountered... The Plot is bad,probably written by a five-year old child, the actors disgusts me, reminds me of bad soap-opera acting, and the whole thing smells like a movie for children... I can only say one thing about this movie: If you love Robocop 1 & 2 and have no experience with this movie, well, do not see it, okay?! It will ruin your life... It has ruined mine..."
3,Too comic bookish,"The last installment of the Robocop series is nothing more than a comic book put on a movie screen. It is, however, a slight improvement over Robocop 2. I've seen worse but I've also seen better ones."
2,This movie kinda stunk up the house.,"Awe man... Why Anne? She was kinda pretty! Any ways.... so the Robocop name was kinda wasted on this one. Although the robot ninjas were kinda nifty and it was a nice little addition to bring back ED209. I though he was the dopest of all the enemies in Robocop. This title was a little to kiddy for my taste and you can kinda tell from the sudden drop from the usual ""R"" rating in a Robocop movie to the sudden ""pg13"". It wasn't a good move on their part to make it appeal more to children than to adults. It should have been kept a mature film."
5,he's back again,Robocop 3 is awesome. i don't understand why so many people don't like it. i think it's a good movie. it's a must see for robocop fans
1,Oh man!,What a crap film this is!Some films are so bad that they are funny. This isn't one of them. It's just plain bad.I have nothing more to say on the subject cept make sure that your holding a loaded gun to your head before you start watching this film.That way you can put yourself out of your misery in the fastest possible way.
2,Worst Robocop Yet?,"This movie was a colossal failure. The storyline and plot were good but Burke sucked as Robocop and there are to many unanswered questions from Robo 2 that weren't answered in Robo 3...#1:What happended to the Old Man from Robocop 1&2? Did he die? How did Rip Torn become the Leader of OCP?#2:What happended to Dr. Faxx? Did she just disappear?#3:What happended to the mayor and how did OCP get control of the city?#4:Where is Peter Weller?Do you see what I mean? The only positive things about this movie are the storyline, the introduction of the Rehab team and Basil Poulodoris's theme. John Castle was good as Paul McDaggett but other than him and Nancy Allen (Lewis) no one else really lit up the screen. It is also a shame that Lewis was killed by McDaggett. This movie flopped big time"
1,Robocop becomes Aerocop!,"Whoa!! A flying robocop with the strings attached and all. No way man, this one bombs. And where's Peter Weller? The dude IS Robocop!!! Cheesy movies I can handle, but this one's going moldy. Time for Robocop III to catch a wave. See yah!"
2,2 1/2 stars for yet another unecessary sequel,"There was no reason to make another movie in this series, but I guess there were still some action figures to be sold so here it is. In PG-13, no less! Boy, where to start. Well after 5 or 6 years, the evil OCP is still trying to tame Detroit and build a bigger badder cop. Now the Japanese have taken over OCP and have a Robo of their own and they are twin/triplets? For the most part this 3rd feature is just as bad as the 2nd one, but at least we see some of the townsfolk putting up some resistance. I'm also giving a little credit for some then new acting faces that are more recognized today. Although Peter Weller wisely didn't come back in the role of Murphy watch for Rip Torn, CCH Pounder, Mako, Stephen Root, Bradley Whitford and Jill Hennessy."
2,Robocop 3(1993),"Robocop 3(1993) was the last nail in the coffin for the Robocop film franchise. B movie director Fred Dekker tones down the violence and adds a lot of campy humor into the film so it can get a PG-13 rating. Peter Weller bailed from the series and Robert John Burke was cast as Robocop! Officer Lewis(Nancy Allen) is tragically killed off by an evil OCP officer! Robocop takes sides with people who are being kicked out of their homes by OCP so they can build Delta City over Old Detroit. The film is even more camped up by throwing a robo-ninja into the movie! Basil Poledouris returned to give us a real Robocop music score. Robocop 3 is a mish-mash of serious drama and campy comedy. Robocop ""borrows"" a pimp's car to chase bad guys! Even with the best of intentions, Robocop 3 was still a failure."
1,Why they did this,Robocop 3 has to be the worst possible movie in the series. While the first and the second had great humour and quite gory action sequenses the third installment hasn't got any of the critsism against the corporate world and the plot of the movie is simply rubbish .The film is made for kids and the flying Robocop just makes you wanna cry .I gave one star just because Basil Poledouris great theme is back from the first film.
4,robocop is here to save the day,"Robocop 3 wasn't nearly as unintentionally comical as I had hoped. Instead, it's pretty similar to the original Robocop, but with updated movie technics to make the picture and effects at least appear better, even though the storytelling is just as cheesy as it always was.One thing that was very cheesy was the ending where Robocop finds an ability to fly. It was extremely funny watching him fly around the city taking out the bad guys.The amount of action was pretty good, as far as enjoyment in that area is concerned. As for the storytelling aspect, well, a little girl entered the scene in the very beginning that showed her parents getting shoved into a bus, never to be seen again. The little girl, who's a computer genius, becomes friends with Robocop.If you liked the first Robocop, I believe you'll this one just as much. There's plenty of humor as well, mostly from the words Robocop says. Just forget about ""flying Robocop"" near the end."
2,Wow...Really Not Good,"Robocop: Great, great sci-fi action film, famous mostly for it's extreme graphicness. Rated R.Robocop 2: Manages to be just as, if not more, graphic than Robocop. You can tell they try to be controversial too. (Kid as a drug lord, man holds a gun to a baby's head) Rated R.Robocop 3: New actor, Robocop learns to fly...almost no blood the entire film. Rated PG13.What the $#!@ happened?!"
2,This is Painfully SH*T!!!,"After the high quality of the first two films there's only one way to go...downhill and fast.This film put plain and simply is pants! A crappy japanese cyborg is created as the new nemesis for robocop, & it looks exactly like a human.A piss-take of the first two films rolled into one, what a disaster...ignore this film."
1,Lead in for TV Series and lame tv movies,"This movie must have been made as a pilot for the series that followed. This would explain the lack of wit and social commentary as well as the toning down of the violence. This movie had a serious continuity problem. Nobody seems to have noticed that in the first two movies Robocop had a son, yet in the 3rd movie during the flashbacks he had a daughter. This was truly a bad sequel."
2,THIS IS KINDA INSULTING TO THE FIRST TWO MOVIES,"OCP PLANS ON DESTROYING DETROIT TO BUILD DELTA CITY. BUT, WHEN A GANG OF ANGERED RESIDENTS DECIDE TO FIGHT OCP BACK, PROBLEMS IMMEDIATELY BEGIN. TO ADD TO THE PROBLEMS, ROBOCOP [PLAYED HERE BY ROBERT JOHN BURKE] JOINS THE PEOPLE IN THEIR QUEST FOR FREEDOM. NOT AS VIOLENT AS THE FIRST TWO MOVIES, AND IT'S ALSO NOT AS GOOD. THE BIGGEST MISTAKE THEY MADE WITH THIS MOVIE WAS TO REPLACE PETER WELLER AS ROBOCOP. ROBERT JOHN BURKE JUST SEEMS LOST AS ROBOCOP. THIS SERIES WAS SERIOUSLY STARTING TO RUN OUT OF STEAM TOWARD THIS POINT. WHY COULDN'T THEY JUST KEEP THIS ONE ON THE SHELF? ANYWAY, ANOTHER BIG MISTAKE THEY MADE WAS TO HAVE ANN, ROBO'S PARTNER FROM THE FIRST TWO MOVIES, GET KILLED. HAS A FEW GOOD ACTION SEQUENCES, BUT IT'S SERIOUSLY LACKING THE ENTERTAINMENT THAT CAME WITH THE FIRST TWO MOVIES. IF YOU STILL HAVEN'T SEEN THIS BUT YOU WANNA SEE IT, RENT THIS, BUT DON'T BUY THIS. FOLLOWED BY FOUR DIRECT-TO-VIDEO MOVIES."
5,Lovely ghosts,"Kozinsky's interpretation of Reger's op. 57 is rather controlled; the double fugue glides without shakes, the organ seems to favour it spreading out an uniform sound mantle; if you are fond of this work, and wait for the wise ""slowdowns"" before theme's repeats, as Wheinberger or Germani did, you'll be disappointed. Moreover Bach's BWV 562, in comparison with so much discography, does not present surprises of great importance. The listener thinks: another organist philologist? Till Karg Elert's spirit on the one hand, on the other Karl Richter appear suddenly to Kozinsky on track n5: it's only possible this way to explain an incredible, rhapsodical, furious interpretation of a real masterpiece, whose I don't know different recordings. Only this one merits more than five stars; but never I saw before someone to face a program so deadly for an anthological CD. Thank's to GM Records.Roberto Ranieri"
5,Great find,I was surprised to even find this battery. I have had my Bayco rechargeable light for years and one of the batteries is failing so to find a replacement for it was a very good thing. You have to love Amazon for the variety of items it sells. The battery was shipped quickly and works as advertised. Thanks Amazon!
3,Feverbirds Claw,"I would recommend this book to 12-13 year olds. I liked this book because of the message it tells you about never giving up. I gave it 3 stars because it was boring and confusing at some parts, but I loved it all the same."
4,EclipseUML would be nice and an American Version,"Great book, however we're using EclipseUML which seems to be more widely used now. It would be nice to be written with that program in mind. Also would be nice if it was converted to American English. Some analagies are hard to understand if you're not familiar with Brittish colloquialisms. Also, author uses Textio class to do outputs. Why not just use the System classes? Seems unnecessary to me and an extra level of confusion for beginners."
2,"Good appearance, poor performance","The problem lies in the cd player. If you are listening to quiet music, there is an overbearing noise from the unit, weather a bad bearing or poor design. It sounds metallic in nature. I tried two independent units and they both exhibited this metallic rubbing noise. If all you listen to is loud music, this is good for you. If you listen to classical, etc. Stay away."
4,Raising the Voice: A New Poet on the Loose,"Reading Rigoberto Gonzalez's poetics was a feast, a delight on a snowy night in New England. Having just returned from Michoacan, I savored the poet's use of space, diction, and lyricism, mapping a necessary poetics in the American imaginary.It is clear that the poet is meticulous with language. He uses the senses to their maximum potential and creates something wonderful that is poetry. As an aficionado of poetry, I so anticipate such caliber of poetry and prose from Rigoberto Gonzalez in the future."
5,Kicks like a mule!,"Alright, it's pricey but if you want the best, most powerful air hammer on the market, this is it, no joke. I work for a GM dealership and do alot of front end work. My snap-on air hammer ph3045 (not blue point) can't compare to this thing. I work with a guy who has one of these and whenever I had trouble he'd break his 717 out and knock whatever it was out without a problem. Ball joints, wheel studs, bearings, no problem. Thats why I bought one. You will not be disappointed! Everyone in my shop always talks about this air hammer as the end all to anything stuck and it never disappoints!"
5,Grew Up On This,"Even though this album is now well over 20 years old, it still hold a special place in my heart. I spent many car trips listening to Hooked On Classics when I was a child. The music is wonderfully arranged to cover a wide variety of classics in a single album.Highly recommended!"
5,Troma's War,"After a Tromatic plane crash on an island somewhere off the face of Cuba, a few spirited Tromaville Citizens are about to find out the harsh reality of guerilla warfare. It is only a short period of time before the battle for life and death begins in one of Troma's ultimate masterpieces. If you like Troma, an interesting plot, or just a plain bloodbath, then Troma's war has it all. Though not the best Troma film, it is still worth getting. Unfortunately, it doesn't measure up to the wonderfully black standards of Terror Firmer, but then again, what could? It is still an amazing film, and a good storyline."
2,"ohh god, its those Troma freaks again!","I must say that, even for Troma, this one was pretty bad. A plane crash leaves tourists stranded on a tropical island that happens to be the home base of a group of nasty terrorists. Now, think Troma: how would YOU work with this plot? Needless to say, there are MANY dead before it ends. I thought there was a limit to the amount of blood and guts one could put into a movie (and smear on a woman's breasts) untill I saw ""War"". The movie is rather low quality, not like some of the newer Troma releases, but if you like classic Troma, it dosn't get any more classic than this. Not one for the kiddies!"
3,Fun film for what it is...not Troma's best,"You must remove your trained cinematic eyes and replace them with a pair specially designed for Troma viewing. The opening scene just killed me. I thought it was so funny and that may be reason enough for therapy, but either way the music, the girl crying, dead bodies everywhere and the black preacher's speach made for one helluvan opening scene. The film is ok for the next 1/2 hour or so, but really takes off during the war scenes. Lotsa killing and cool characters.It is a really bad film, but as I said before there's quite a bit of redeemable humor scattered throughout. I recommend renting before buying."
4,AIRBORNE!!!!,One of Tromas Best Movies Besides The Epic Toxic Avenger. The Best Part of The Movie besides the Blood and Guts Was The Guy Who Was AIRBORNE! Killing everyone and Wearing Their Ears. timeless Classic.
5,More Action Than All Four Rambo Films,"Troma's War is a different kind of Troma movie. Sure, it's violent, dumb (in a good way), and has some good t & a. But it's also more of an action movie instead of a horror-comedy, which is what Troma is famous for. It's pretty much non-stop exciting, violent, and action-packed. They don't make them like this anymore, unfortunately. Also, while watching I felt like I was watching a lost entry in the Rambo series, or maybe a sequel to Commando. It's like Rambo and Commando, only done Troma-style, and I'd say it has more action than either of those or the rest in the Rambo series. I recommend Troma's War if you're a fan of Troma movies, or violent shoot em' up action movies. You won't be disappointed."
2,Tromas war,A shoot em up about a group of air crash survivors stranded on a desert island.This ragtag bunch soon find themselves fighting terrorists bent on taking over the United States with the aids virus.Made by the creators of the toxic avenger this frequently tastless flick combines violent action with totally deadpan comedy.Two versions R rated and Directors cut directors cut has way more gore than the R rated.
1,I cant believe I'm reviewing this.,"This movie is so tasteless, that it scares me that even one person gave it a good review. I mean come on, a pig nosed commando(yeah right) and a bunch of accomplices who would have trouble successfully making toast are gonna infiltrate the U.S. infrastructure and wreak havoc with the Aids virus? Asnd they are thwarted no less than by a bunch of air crash survivors who have to screw each other before they can muster up the guts to stop this evil plot. Oh man this is bad!"
3,Good Book for Young People,I didn't know it was a young people's book when I bought it - however I did read it and it was well done. Please note that despite the title it has nothing to with the Rolling Stones song of the same name!
2,Workable radios,"I have had these walkie talkies (Cobra PR 165-2 VP microTALK) for a couple months now. They work fairly well. Be aware that since this is a dual band radio you need to be careful what channel you transmit on if you don't have a license from the FCC. The manual tells which channels are FRS and which are GMRS.These radios are small and easy to carry. They work well for kids to use in a limited area.The range is closer to a half mile than the 6 miles they state. That's normal for FRS radios from what I hear. Near the end of the range the sound cuts in and out, and is hard to understand.One problem: on one of the radios the push to talk button is sensitive, it just barely works and you have to hold it just right or it cuts in and out.One irritation: you can't turn off the roger beep that gets sent after you talk, and it's really loud! If that doesn't bother you, these radios will work fine for you. If that's a problem, find a set that lets you turn the beep off."
2,Charging takes 15 hours!,"I purchased these to remain in contact with friends while on a trip to Mexico. They weren't very helpful. The biggest problem with these is the charge time; it takes 15 hours of charging for less than 8 hours of use. Reception was limited, which I suspect was related the units not the location. I will upgrade to a better set before my next vacation."
4,Jordan Fan,"I tried to order a fair amount of Micheal Jordans and it seems like you bill shipping for each card, I hope thats an error from amazon, if this can be corrected so I can start to order in a small bulk fashion. Thats near 5 dollars per card via amazon.Thank YouDavid"
3,Less antedotal/More How-To,"I really hate so called 'experts' in the paranormal that believe their theories are truths and pass them off as such. His 'orb' pictures are obviously soft diffusion from the tombstone reflecting into a lens with a bit of dew on it.The margins are wide, reducing the actual text in the book. The author spends a great deal of time telling stories and actually very little on 'how' to hunt ghosts.Troy Taylor's Guidebook is much better.On the other hand, the forms in the back of the book are great starting points for creating your own tailored forms. There is good information in the book. There just isn't a whole lot of it."
5,recommended for all beginners,"There is a little detective in all of us, but in most cases one wouldn't know where to begin. If you are curious about possible existence of paranormal phenomenon this book gives you that place to start. Whether a skeptic,a believer,this book gives the information needed to begin simple investigations in a manner that is easy to understand. For someone who hasn't had years of experience in the paranormal, or criminal investigation some of the books available can be intimidating. Mr Southalls book however makes you feel that doing your own investigation is within abilities. This book is not perfect, but it give an excellent starting point for the novice to begin investigating from."
3,I'm not really impressed,"This has some good information, but most in here, in my opinion, more common sense for anyone who watches tv to does any reading online. Although I'm not dogging on this book, because it does offer some good information. The haunting information at the beginning does not fit in thsi book. After all it is titled ""How to be a Ghost Hunter"" not Ghost Hunters guide."
4,Good book....little disappointed,"The book was an easy read for the in-training investigator. I was however a little disappointed by the one mistake about the Greenbrier Ghost, it said the year, which had the last 2 numbers switched in the paragraph, I probably wouldn't have caught it if it hadn't been for the photograph of the tombstone directly below it.Besides, that little mistake, I found the book enjoyable and it gave me a lot of ideas on what to take into my next investigation."
2,"It's OK, in places poorly written","A very basic book, seems to be a promotional tool for certain tours, if this type of book is your first read it will serve a purpose."
3,"Cute, but kind of cheap looking","This is a cute little pendant from the front, but the backs of the key and lock aren't finished, so when they get turned around, which will ultimately happen since they're hanging on a chain, the not-so-pretty side will show. I'm satisfied with it for the price, though. I like the bale the charms hang from as it can be put on various sizes of chains. I plan to take the key and lock off and try them as earrings, too."
3,Nice Piece but Very Small,"it's probably my fault, but this is a very small pendant. sized more for a child than an adult. the chain is also very thin. there are many other pendants to choose from in this price range and I wish I chose one of them."
4,"Very good, but...","I used this book as a supplement to a crash course in Statistics for Graduate School. It is very good, but it can be a little skimpy on complete explaination of all the variables in an equation.One good feature of the text is that the next chapter builds on the previous. The complexity of the various statistical equations grows gradually. This is helpful in may respects, but the writer(s) assume that the reader has an EXCEPTIONAL memory and can readily recall details from 1, 2, or 3 chapters back which apply to the current text. I found myself going back and re-reading previous chapters to get a handle on the chapter I was actualy reading.Overall, the book is good but on one should try to use it as their sole book on business statistics."
2,"Lots of Substance, but not in line with regular Statistics program","I had used this book to supplement my Stats course, but found that lots of symbols that they used were not the same. Also, the equations differed for many of the calculations. You would get the same answers, but if your busy with school, you won't have time to reconcile the two. Good book if you are trying to learn on your own though."
1,Disappointed,"Made for kindle fire,however words too small to read and they don't blow up like other children's books. I do not recommend"
4,Beautiful story but needs technical work.,"The story is lovely, and I am quite sure my grandchildren will enjoy it. The illustrations are sharp and colorful. There are two troublesome problems. First there is an incomplete paragraph half way through the book. Even worse is that it takes several taps to enlarge the tiny font. On some pages one tap did it. On others, it took several taps. A few times I gave up."
1,Impossible to read,The print is so incredibly small that I couldn't even finish reading it (I am in my early 30's with perfect vision and do not use glasses). Seemed like a cute story if only the format was better.
3,print is too small!,"The illustrations and story are wonderful!The book has not been modified for the Kindle, however, and the print is WAYYYYYY to small to read comfortably. We're talking .4 font in places. Yowch."
2,Not a great Kindle transfer,"The illustrations are great, but the text is too small. There is no way to increase the size of the text. Get your magnifying glass out."
2,Bug Book - Class Library,"I like the cover of the book and the accuracy in the illustrations--six legs, antenna, etc. However, the book is not easy to read. The print type and size is not condusive for student literacy. The print is very difficult to read and it appears to be in about 8-9 pitch throughout the book. The illustrations tend to be dark in nature. The print type is artistic but it varies too much for emergent readers. I have difficulty seeing the small print. Nonetheless, it is a charming book and I use it to support my insect theme inside the learning environment."
5,I loved this book.,My mom read this book to me. I liked because it was a new book. I liked the sqeegy bug because he wanted wings and a stinger but instead the spider gave him wings and a light. I would recommend this book. I am 9 years old.
3,Interesting but maybe not reliable,"I bought read this out of my interest in the life of the 1960s South African journalist Nat Nakasa. It did help flesh out my sense of the legendary Drum Magazine of the 1950s, and it had a few things by and about Nakasa I haven't found readily available in the US, but some of the information it does have about him is incorrect, especially things to do with his last year of life in the US, leading up to his apparent suicide."
1,Pissed Off!!!!!,"When I ordered this item, I first checked the customer reviews and they were positive...so I ordered it. What I ordered and what actually came via mail were different! I ordered an OLIVE GREEN poncho and I received a BROWN poncho!!! When I attempted to contact to company (SPAGHETTI WESSTERN COLLECTIBLES), there was no number, no address, no e-mail!!! This company (SPAGHETTI WESTERN COLLECTIBLES) is NOT reliable!!! I wished to exchange this product but I got nothing but unavailability!!!DON'T BUY FROM SPAGETTI WESTERN COLLECTIBLES!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Everyday Creative: 30 Ways to Wake Up Your Inner Artist,I really liked the cards. I teach a class in creativity and I was able to give them to individual students to encourage their creative growth.
4,Everything Helps,"When it comes to being creative, we often need help. Eric Maisel's books have given me great insight into the creative process, as well as concrete suggestions for assistance when creating doesn't come easy. These cards so far haven't helped me in a deep way, but they are fun, and encouraging. They would probably help more if I used them in a more ritualized, consistent way."
1,Distasteful dystopia.,"Tittle the ""ethicist"" (more like elitist) puts her faith in Eugenics. Welcome to Nazi Germany for the 21st century.She proposes the development of a contraceptive vaccination universally administered to children at puberty, the antidote only given following an individual's licensing by the government. Now logically, the inevitable illegal pregnancies would have to be halted by abortion. Forced government abortions. China, anyone? Or at the very least, ripping babies from the arms of ""unsuitable"" mothers and awarding them to more correct ones. Fascist Argentina in the 1970s?Wonder why so many copies of her book are available for sale used? Hmmm. Remainder table. Should have aborted the book."
1,Very Disappointing,"Oh dear, this was such a disappointment. Diana Ackerman spends too much time in pointless shots (looking a river; admiring her own photos from childhood) and has produced a NOVA series that seriously misses the mark. Too little science, too much irrelevant material. While one can certainly connect art and human experience with scientific knowledge about how the brain works, this series didn't do so successfully. If you were hoping to reveal the wonder of the senses for your students, do not buy this series. Unfortunately, I ordered it through an affiliated store with Amazon and they won't answer my queries about whether/how I can return it."
2,Not very informative,"This series was a disappointment. The narrator, Diane Ackerman, apparently an author in her own right, gives a disjointed, rambling discussion of the five senses, with bits of science (interviews with actual research scientists, which Ackerman is not) joined to rather arbitrary examples of how the senses are involved in various cultural activities. Ackerman's examples are often a bit of a stretch, and her monologues are full of distractingly florid language. Kind of a New Age/postmodern pseudo-anthropological view of what science knows so far about the senses. I believe that Ackerman was trying to convey sensuality in her delivery, but I found myself increasingly annoyed by her throaty-yet-girlish voice, heavy make-up, and grating self-involvement. There was too much of her and not enough science. There are far better Nova series out there, and I'm sure that there are better programs about the five senses. I don't recommend this series."
2,Not for experienced users,"I purchased this book with the idea that it might teach me something new, but I was mistaken. If you already have basic Photoshop knowledge, this may not be the book for you. I returned it because my money would be better invested elsewhere. If you have no idea where to begin with digital artwork, then I would recommend taking a look here. This is for the novice, not the intermediate or advanced user."
5,Brilliant cellist,"This is truly exciting music. Played with passion, this arrangement explores little known Slavik and Eastern European music. The ensemble between the cello and piano is faultless and the richness of the cello sound (played on an 1733 Testore) makes the album memorable. Karen Kaderavek, already a well established cellist, will go far."
4,Bjork rules!,"Bjork might be somewhat of an acquired taste, but even if you don't like her you have to admit that she is completely original and unlike any other artist out there. Bjork is always ahead of her time! Not all the songs on Post blew my mind but the ones that did (HyperBallad especially) make this album one of my favorites. Become a Bjork fan, you can always wow non-Bjorkers with her wonderful voice and melodic weirdness :) (Plus, Bjork is so adorable! I love seeing her in interviews just to hear her talk! :)"
4,splendid,"Bjork shows with her album 'Post', tha tshe's not following the comercial way. The song are creative and the CD is a mixture of joy and meditation She finds the inspiration of the texts in her own personality Her voice is a miracle"
2,I weep.,"This collection of tunes is an experiment with rock. I'm loving Björk's vocals, all though over-produced to an inch of her life. This LP is too eclectic to be eclectic. Post seems an effort to please mainstream goons. The LP feels forced."
3,way over hyped,"this is a good disc, no doubt, but hardly worthly of the surfeit of accolades it has received. post is a market product--made-for-the-rave material--calculated to be quirky and accessible at the same time. the idea that bjork has boldly ventured into new territory (or even broken any new ground) is absurd. if you're a fan you'll be satisfied by post, if not you'll find yourself wondering what all the fuss is about (with good reason)."
2,This sure ain't the Sugarcubes!,"I bought this CD simply because I spent my teenage years listening to the Sugarcubes, and I LOVED THE SUGARCUBES. I'm quite disappointed though cause this just doesn't sound like them. I mean sure the songs have Bjork's trademark singing voice, but the style of the music is rather boring. The only song I like on here is ""Army of Me"". The rest is just filler to me. Sorry Bjork if I'm not digging your solo career."
2,Uninteresting and over-hyped,"I bought this CD on the basis of the rave reviews here. After the first listening, I was bored and couldn't see what the fuss was about. After listening another 3 times, I found the album even less interesting. What I was expecting was the excitement and artistry of, say, the early Streissand albums. Bjork turned out to be a disappointment. Her vocal technique is so-so, and her lyrics are largely insipid. Obviously, many people like her work, but for me(a member of the minority) her music just doesn't do very much. Maybe after listening a few more times, I will finally see the light. But then again, there seem to be a lot of used copies of this album for sale, so maybe listeners are giving up and trying to recoup their lost money."
4,Army of Bjork.,"As much as I enjoy all her work, front to back this is easily my favorite album of hers. The music is as colorful as the cover. ""Army Of Me"" is nearly industrial pop, ""Hyperballad"" sounds like just that, and ""It's Oh So Quiet"", maybe her most popular song ever, sounds like it came right out of a Broadway musical. Two other highlights for me are ""Possibly Maybe"", which usually puts me in a trance, and ""I Miss You"", which is just wonderfully wacky, much like it's video. Newcomers should first grab her ""Greatest Hits"", but after that, ""Post"" is the most."
4,"Good here, bad there","This album is a mix of some really great songs, and some bad ones. Army of Me, while a decent song, does not allow Bjork to use her amazingly expressive voice, which is what makes her so good. Hyperballad is the best Bjork song ever, and the song that got me hooked on her. The Modern Things is good, not incredible. It's Oh So Quiet is awesome, great change of pace. Enjoy is decent, but sounds more like a song for Homogenic or Vespertine. You've Been Flirting Again bores me to death every time, I usually skip it. Isobel rocks, good beat and melody. Possibly Maybe also rocks, and falls just short of Hyperballad for the best lyrics on the album. I miss you is an embarrasment, along with the worst Bjork music video I've ever seen. The band that kicks in at about 2:00 saves it a little. Cover me is pretty boring too. Headphones is cool if you listen to it with headphones on.Overall its not the best Bjork album, but you should buy it just for Hyperballad, It's Oh So Quiet, and Isobel."
5,"""Post"" is a true masterpiece, showing Bjork at her finest.","""Post"" is Bjork's most outstanding effort to date. Much anticipated to follow in the success of her previous release ""Debut"", ""Post"" has emerged with new and different experiments in sound. The magical blend of dance beats and strong classical instruments like violins and cellos, sets this artist apart from all others. The powerful tracks of this album, are extremely versatile, resembling big-band, orchestral pieces, and funky techno rhythms- yet it is all Bjork. With her extraordinary vocal talents, it almost wouldn't matter what she had to say but we are thankful for the grace and poetry of her lyrics. Bjork is like no other and this album is a true musical experience."
2,Not a true CD Audio or DVD Audio Disc,I'm a big bjork fan - I'm also a big fan of the higher fidelity DVD Audio format and remastered CD sound (although some remasters are atrocious) - so I thought this disc was a great buy.However I wasn't pleased to find that the CD Audio side won't play in the car or on the computer as it's not recognized as a CD Audio disc (apparently not uncommon with Dual Discs) - just as frustrating is the lack of true DVD-Audio using MLP (Meridian Lossless) which is superior to the Dolby and DTS surround sound provided here. Interestingly my computer was happy to read the DVD side but reports the surround sound as 48/24 for both Dolby and DTS not the 96/24 claimed. If you are looking for the superior audio you thought this disc offered - then you'll need to be happy playing it on your DVD player only. Disappointing. I already own the videos on DVD - so I haven't taken that into consideration in this review.
4,Post,"A challenging record that's worth the effort. ""Army of Me"" and ""Isobel"" are favorites and the big band arrangements and trademark mysterious weirdness make it stylistically diverse."
4,It starts with a bang...,"""Army of Me"" is the supernova exploding, letting off fragments of Bjork's pure creative force through the galaxy of this album. It produces a beautiful chaos..."
1,Another monotonous drone,I've tried to get into this artist but I cannot. I would rather listen to 20 hours of someone's fingernails on a chalkboard than what passes for Bjork's voice. Avoid unless you like to hear your dog howl.
1,Possibly The Worst Singer In The World!,I listened to this C.D. a while back & I almost went deaf this cd is awful this chick can not sing & this album is so freaky & scary!I could barely get through this whole cd! If I could give it zero stars I would! I have never heard of her kind of music it's like she has her own music catergory!If your into freaky & different stuff then you probably will like it! all songs have a outer space sound with weird noises!I don't know what I can recommend to you if you like this except anything Bjork!
5,"Strange, scary and special style","On this wonderful album you'll find some strong and powerful songs, starting whit the opening track "" Army of me "" a very powerful song whit a strong lyric, some men may be a little scary of Björk because of her strong confident.The next song Hyper-ballad is a sweet but strange song, also whit a powerful lyric in it. And at last you'll find Possible Maybe a strong song and Björk really shows what a powerful voice she have."
5,Full of unusual sound effects....,I love this album. All the songs are great and they're so interesting with all the computer like noises in the background. You won't be disappointed with this album!
4,take me with you bjork,the first time i heard hyperballad my heart pounded with the beat...and the plaintive strength of her voice...soso moving...isobel and possibly maybe seduce enchant enthralli can't get over how pretty and powerful bjork is
5,Great concert!,This concert features Ringo playing Beatles classics that he rarely performs live (if ever)... Don't Pass Me By and Octopuses Garden! Ive seen Ringo live several time and these great songs are left out. Considering how great they sound on this concert i hope he considers including them as concert staples. This show lacks the usual greatest hits night of the supporting band (although it has Who Can It Be Now by the Men At Work guy). Wish it included more songs from the band....their contribution is half the show! Instead you get Ringos new material which some songs are surprisingly catchy..others the usual B-side at best type songs. Sound quality and picture on this blu-ray are awesome! Loved it!
5,Ringo Starr and the Roundheads- Live (Blu-ray).,"""Ringo Starr and the Rounheads- Live"" is a 55 minute long, 14 song concert disk released by Soundstage for PBS television, WTTW 11 of Chicago. It is delightful from start to finish, beginning and ending with a Beatles song. Colin Hays (Men at Work) took to the stage as a guest artist to perform ""Who Can It Be Now"".Among the Beatles songs executed by the group are ones on which Ringo Starr sang lead vocals as a Beatle, or for which he is credited as co-writer of the song: With A Little Help From My Friends, Yellow Submarine, Act Naturally, Don't Pass Me By and Octopus's Garden.While a good Beatles tribute band like ""Rain"" is around to delight audiences for many more years it's special to watch a real Beatle on stage leading his own band-the real McCoy. Audio and video quality, as well as performance are all excellent."
4,Ringo and band on fire,"Having seen Ringo and his All Starr Band play live in Liverpool and Glasgow last June, I pretty much knew what to expect from this Blu-ray. I wasn't disappointed! Ringo plays to a formula that works a treat. He keeps the crowd on their feet pretty much the whole time with so many hits from both Beatle days and his solo career. What a treat to see Don't Pass Me By, complete with piano introduction! The band are tight and the picture and sound quality of the blu-ray are excellent. My only disappointments are that it runs for less than an hour, there are no extras on the disc and information about the gig and musicians is almost non-existent. There is also a mistake in the credits where the band is shown as including ""Mark Har"". The keyboard player is former Crowded House member Mark Hart. An unforgivable error. Having said all that, the disc is very entertaining and recommended."
4,Impressing,I was really impressed with this Blu-ray concert. Ringo performed really well. The musicians on stage were very talented and suited Ringo perfectly.
5,Brilliant analysis and evaluation of a great play,"Granville-Barker's prefaces to Shakespeare are highly regarded as the first such written from a theatrical (as opposed to literary) point of view. This approach pays particularly high dividends in dealing with this, one of WS's least appreciated plays. (I am currently appearing in a production of it in NYC -- in a small role.) Jan Kott, in describing ""Troilus and Cressida"" in the 60's, called it ""amazing and modern."" Cymbeline, in the 90's, seems strikingly post-modern, and Granville Barker, writing in the 20's, accurately describes features of the play which speak strongly to our highly collage-like contemporary approach to art. Highly recommended (as is the Arden edition of the play itself, probably the most charming of all the Arden editions)."
1,Took Forever to Receive and is Missing Most of the Play!,"This book took almost two weeks to receive. Not to mention when I did finally get my copy in the mail, I was disappointed to see that the play skipped from Act II to Act V. Very disappointing."
4,One Of Shakespeare's More Challenging Works,"Cymbeline is one of the later Shakespeare plays that is rarely staged and probably even as rarely read. The plot has elements that are familiar from several of the earlier works and many of the characters borrow from more familiar characters in other plays as well. Nevertheless, Cymbeline is a rewarding play to either view or read. The Arden version that I recently read was useful but for the footnotes which focused on various usages and interpretations of the language over time which I found distracting and finally chose to just ignore. The play itself because of the familiar elements will appeal to those who have read the better known works. Cymbeline revolves around a layered plot that includes the devices of mistaken identity, evil and deception , unbridled ambition and political intrigue. It is a rather long play with 5 acts and 27 scenes. Having the benefit of seeing this well staged would enhance the reader's experience."
3,A Minor Shakespeare Play,"This is one of Shakespeare's lesser-known plays, and I still haven't read it. That's why I got it. Soon I shall read it. So there."
3,misleading and outdated,This is probably one of the most outdated and misleading of the Arden editions. Nosworthy really doesn't like the play and dismisses it as an experiment leading up to _The Tempest_. Even his editing of the text is affected by his reading of the play. Only scholars who know something about Shakespeare should venture here.
1,Missing most of the play!,"This version of the play is MISSING Acts III and IV.Act IV, Scene ii contains some of the most famous lines of Shakespeare: ""Fear no more the heat of the sun ..."" So, if you need this play, are crunched for time, and need it to supplement a research paper on stream-of-consciousness and Mrs. Dalloway ... I would definitely GET ANOTHER VERSION!Thanks a lot for the complete rip off."
5,fun,I like Kari Anderson her fun nature laughing while exercising It feels good her queues are easy to follow I have just started to do the step and find it enjoyable.
1,duplicate dvd,This is the same dvd that I had previously purchased with a different cover. I will keep it because I like the workout and the previous dvd skips in places.
3,Why did the price go up $40 overnight?,"I haven't bought this yet, but noticed the price went up $40 overnight. That's a pretty steep price increase! I'm rethinking making this purchase."
5,Outstanding Reception,"I bought this radio on the basis of online reviews promising outstanding reception. I need to get good reception on a relatively weak local station. I've tried several other radios that couldn't do the job, most recently a Sony that looked great, but could not detect the desired station. The Receptor distinguishes between adjoining stations and brings in the program crisply and clearly. It's also nicely compact."
5,Incredible Sound for Modest Price,"We bought this radio after looking at a number of table radios at various price points. The radio was shipped quickly & arrived in original packaging. We paid circa $109. Set-up was incredibly easy; the directions are quite user-friendly & straightforward. Setting preset stations & dual alarm times was simple. Out of the box to installed & playing may have taken 10 minutes. Although we set a number of local stations, we use this Boston Acoustics radio exclusively for playing XM satellite radio (Audiovisions) through an inhouse/incar pioneer satellite radio. The sound quality is crystal clear & stunning. The bass is nicely presented without being overbearing. We wondered about the lack of tone controls but this is a total non-issue since the sound is well balanced & rich. We could have spent more for other brands, but the sound quality from this radio is stunning. Would strongly recommend!!"
5,Terrific Radio-Just what I hoped for,I wanted a kitchen radio(the alarm function was not important)with great sound that I could hear throughout my fairly large apartment and this radio is just delighting me no end. I considered and looked at the Bose and higher-end Boston Acoustic radios and feel that Consumer Reports is spot on rating this their 'best buy' table-top radio. I was wary of warnings about the bass muffling spoken voice(since I mostly listen to NPR)but I'm not having a problem with that at all.
3,The Strongest of Inner Life's Albums,"The Cd packaging does not give the original year of release, and elsewhere there has been some confusion whether this was Inner Life's second or third album. It is, however, their best release. Lead singer Jocelyn Brown is in the forefront of the mix, strong and recognizable in each track and even author of one track (""Pay Girl""). The original album starts and ends with ballads, the first being an especially good torch song, and contains three good dance tunes (""Ain't No Mountain,"" ""Let's Go Another Round,"" ""Let's Get This Thing Together,"" with the latter being a previously unreleased bonus track.) While I never thought that this version of the Ashford and Simpson classic ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" was a definitive one, it and the other tracks grow more memorable with repeated listening. As an album, the whole holds together well and is more than a home to a good extended track padded with filler material. It is one of the better disco era long plays."
3,Not quite what I was expecting,"It just arrived today, so we haven't used it yet. It seems to include everything I want in a school days journal, just it ends at grade 6! The one I have from my childhood went through high school, and I was expecting the same for this one. If you plan to end your child's journal with grade 6, this is perfect! However, if you plan to continue through high school, keep looking. I just ordered two for my other two children that go pre-school through grade 12."
5,Gundam Toys Rock!,"The Gundam series was excellent...and still is to this very day. I really like this product better over the models...although models are awesome, dont get me wrong...I just like playing with the toys and Like how durable they really are. Definetly a worthy catch, Great price for a Nice G-Gundam fighter.Strongly recomended."
4,Different,"This cd was alot different than waiter. The first track is the next eight put together. Long ambiant phases between dark synth driven songs, much more digital than the pervious album. his vice is possibly better in this cd, definatly worth the ep price"
2,Do not buy,"I have been buying these before (from Microcenter). They are very cheap and I thought it was a very good deal. Particularly their 2600mAh for 5 bucks! But...Cons:-Of all the NiMh batteries I tried. This has the most number of failures. Some just dies. Some would hold very low charges after just a few cycles.-It is bigger in circumference compared to other batteries. Which will not fit some of my cameras and gadgets.-Exterior is made of paper and gets easily smashed, deformed.Pros:-Price. but for this kind of quality... not worth it.Also: With all the new low discharge batteries flooding the market (Eneloops, Rayovacs, Duracell, Kodak, etc.) There is no longer any reason to buy this kind of batteries. Even this company is now manufacturing their own Hybrio."
4,Great value,This product is exactly what I needed to hold my scrapbook paper and it slides right under my desk. It is heavy duty enough that it holds all my paper with no sagging or bending.
3,RETURNED,"I purchased this, and when it arrived, it was too small to hold the bin. I returned it, and am waiting for a credit."
2,This was an incredibly boring book.,"William Bradford's Of Plymouth Plantation is perhaps the most boring and vexatious book I have ever read. The plain style employed by Bradford is, undoubtably, because of his Puritan backgroud, but that is still no excuse for the tedious and often archaic redition of events. I should think that a high-school text book would give a more lively presentation of life in the ""New Jerusalem"", as Bradford calls it. The antidiluvian vocabulary and monotonous recording of events made this a very difficult book to get through. I would not recommend it to my peers"
3,history,"This book is 1 of 2 firsthand accounts written about Plymouth Colony that I have read.Both are in the language of the 17th Century and Shakespeare, and therefore hard to read for comprehension, the first time.William Bradford wrote this book many years after the fact, but it covers the period of time the Separatists left England for Holland, Holland to America, and the settlement of Plymouth Colony through its first decades."
3,"A marvel of ergonomic design, but ...","This is a beautifully designed radio with well-thought-out, intuitive controls. It is a pleasure to look at and to use. However, its boomy, unnatural bass range is a disappointment in a relatively high-end radio. At this price point, surely one might expect, if not accurate bass sound, at least a tone control. We might well have returned this had we not read a reviewer's suggestion to stuff the port with cotton, which reduced the boom to a tolerable level."
4,ultimate food count book,"The Complete Book of Food Counts is essential to any successful healthy lifestyle. It is concise, clear and helpful in every way. I just had gastric bypass surgery and this book was recommended by my surgeon to help guide me nutritionally as I begin my new journey to eating right. This book will enable me to do that."
3,Where's the saturated fat?,"This book is very useful, with thousands of entries telling how many calories, protein grams, etc. are in the foods that you're eating. I would've given it five stars except for one thing. The cover clearly advertises that counts for saturated fat are included. Well, I wish I could make the saturated fat disappear like the authors of this book! There aren't any entries at all for saturated fat. I had to go buy a different book.For misleading the public I deducted a full two stars. I think the least the publisher could do is print a sticker to cover up the offending book area with the correct information."
5,Use your intelligence,"A previous review bemoans the fact that there is ""no entry"" for saturated fat. If you look at the book, the entries are for particular foods, from abalone to zucchine; and in a separate part, for chain restaurants from Arby's to White Castle. For EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THESE ENTRIES there is a column that lists grams of saturated fat. Also listed are measurements for calories, protein. carbohydrates, sodium, fiber, total fat, cholesteral and percentage of fat. This seems very useful, systematic and honest. Please ignore the ranting of the previous writer, who clearly has not read or does not understand the organization of the book."
2,incomplete,"I need nutrients as well as calories, protein, carbs, sodium, fiber, fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, and %fat calories. This book does not cover nutrients."
4,Good collection of songs by Australian Icons,"This is a great collection of songs from Farnham, Newton-John and Warlow, plus covers of other well known songs. A really good mix of vocal talents and I love the version of Granada done by John Farnham and Anthony Warlow. I'd thoroughly recommend it if you like any of these three artists or just looking for a good concert CD."
1,GOT IT BUT....,"GOT IT ON TIME BUT....TAPE WAS SCRATCHY AND HARD TO WATCH. IT LOOKED LIKE THE TRACKING WAS OFF SO I TRIED TO ADJUST THE TRACKING SINCE THIS IS A VHS TAPE. IT DID NOT HELP, I GUESS THE TAPE WAS JUST TOO OLD AND SCRATCHY. THEY SHOULD HAVE REVIEWED IT BEFORE SENDING IT OUT. WELL, A LOSS FOR ME. WHAT CAN I SAY, WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT OF AN OLD VHS TAPE. NOT WORTH THE MONEY, VERY DISAPPOINTED."
4,Penetrating a tough culture,A great challenge to get back to timeless basics. A simple but profound reminder of what it takes to impact culture of any age.
4,Relaxation guidance,"3 different relaxation sessions with explanations embedded within, along with hypnotic programing to help release tension, fears and any pre-programmed negatives which might be preventing pregnancy. Also programming for women who have physical problems that might be inhibiting their fertility. All designed to help remove mental blocks from the subconscious to promote healing on the physical level and mental level. Overall the sessions are very relaxing and refreshing."
1,Do not buy this coffeemaker,"This coffeemaker only brewed two pots of coffee before it stopped working. It's going back! the third 12 cup cycle took 45 minutes to brew 7 cups of coffee and boil off 5 cups water. The fourth (and last) brew cycle wouldn't pump water to the brew basket at all. When you open the water reservoir lid to see what's wrong you'll get scalded with steam rising out of the spout. It's noisy - sputtering, gurgling. One star is too high a rating for the machine we ended up with."
3,OK but has a few design quirks.,"I purchased one of these coffee makers because the Mr. Coffee brand has been around for quite some time and it didn't cost a fortune. While the Mr. Coffee coffee maker worked good and made coffee as it should, it does have a few design quirks. First of all, the carafe is designed horribly. You can't pour a cup of coffee without it leaking down the side. This made it a pain, and a mess, to pour any coffee. Another less serious issue with it is the fact that the window showing you how high the water level in the coffee maker, is frosted, and makes it kind of difficult to see what the water level is (being that the unit is white). While this coffee maker is OK and does what it is supposed to, there are better ones on the market for your money."
1,I'd rather give up coffee.,"Dear Sirs,I purchased one of the Mr. Coffee CG12 coffeemakers in November of 2005. I have never seen a more poorly designed coffeemaker. What a piece of refuse! Because of its faulty design, it got coffee all over the countertop whenever it was brewing. I tried two of them and they both did the same thing. The whole design was slapdash. It should be taken off the market.After putting up with it for two months, I threw it in the trash and bought a Black and Decker. It was like going from a VW to a Rolls. Never again."
2,Poor design.,"The good news is that this coffee maker doubles as a humidifier. Steam shoots out of mine like a 19th century train locomotive. The lack of a proper seal between the filter basket lid and the water reservoir is the culprit.The filter basket and water reservoir are also not separate chambers. This causes steam to rise from the filter basket, hit the lid, and condense as water back into the reservoir. No doubts this is the main factor contributing to the very long brewing process."
2,i am the one,"the costume does not open in the front. runs a little small. i have a 42inch chest and couldnt get it on. i would have still used it if i could have just worn it open, but it does not open so i sent it back"
2,Pretty Basic,"Okay for a costume, but cheap materials, especially sunglasses. Easy to put on, but just so so. Probably wouldn't buy again."
2,Treading Water,"This Inner Life lp is much like the earlier ""I'm Caught Up"" in that it showcases a spectacular song (""Moment Of My Life"") and the rest is filler. This track can be found elsewhere on compilation sets in both original and remixed forms."
3,pretty good,"they continued the same sound and rhythm as from their first lp. its pretty good and the best tracks on here are moment of my life, i like it like that, and find somebody. the rest is pretty much bland filler. worth checking it out."
3,A look into inner city schools and reform,"Anyon gives us a glimpse into the world of inner city schooling and everything that goes with it. This is an eye opening journey for educators that do not teach in the inner city schools. I do feel that she is way off and don't believe that some of her suggestions would actually work to improve the schools. She has not herself worked as an educator in the inner city schools. So how does she know that what she is reccommending will work?She does make a good point and that new funding is needed in the schools. It is just a matter of where to get those funds. I do believe that educationing our young children is a responsiblity for all of America, therefore everyone should help in the funding process. I do not think that one soul contributor should be used."
4,Jesse a good story,"I liked this book , the story was interesting and it showed different sides of American culture from the eyes of an immigrant farm worker."
4,Jesse,"This book is about two Mexican brothers,Jesse and Abel who are tired of struggling to be abel to live the next day. They both work long hours in cotton and grape fields to be abel to put themselves through college, but no matter hard they try things always get in their way.Recommendations:I think that i would recommend this book to everyone adults and my peers.I would like my peers to read this book because it would help them to see that no matter who or what comes in their wat , never give up but keep on going because if it is for the good it will only make you a better person."
1,Boring Book,"I picked this book up thinking it would be good (yes, I judge books by the covers). It was awful...I am not sure why I even kept reading it all the way through. There is no action or anything. He and his brother are poor, his brother gets girls (he doesn't)...boring..boring. I don't even know what the author was trying to communicate with the audience. If you don't want to waste your time, don't read this book."
1,School assignment,This was a school assignment for my son. I read the book first so I could quiz him on it. It is in my top 5 of the worst books ever! Don't waste your time...unless it's a mandatory school assignment.
3,New life,The book Jesse. It was a very different to me to how differ from my culture to American is. Differences is make me think a lot of my past. I think I was had a very easy life with my teenage. I thank to my parants. But I don't remerber I was have any gender for my futures. I thnik the Jesse and his brother had a right choice for their future. And I hope they never give up for there dreams. I think this book is good for the who have no idear for the differens to been a poor or rich. I leand a lot of stuffs alike they have a not much choice of their meal. And they are worked hard and study but still they don't have a enough money for the extra stuff to do as like when they want to go to little vacations because they don't have a car so they have to looking for a ride and some how they never get to there but the Jesse and his brother is still happy to there little vacations I really like to there appreciation so I really recommend to young people and from a differen culture.
2,Mostly motivational !,"Good as a primer, there are others that are more detailed. But, buy & read all you can, cheaper than the smallest ""mistake""."
3,"A satisfying, if brief analysis of 2 absolutist Kings","A good book to read if you are into the absolutist Kings of Medieval France. Not much new information, but does seem to do a good job of comparing the 2 kings to the rise of absolutism in France. It would be better if the author seperated the two kings into two different biographies."
3,OK,This gun is a great to shoot. it shoots pretty fast and has ok range but barely hurts at all. When i first started shooting it it was great. but about 300 rounds later (which isnt that long w/ a machine gun) it jammed and took forever to clear out. now it seems to keep jamming all the time. though its is good for what i paid for it.
4,Great Product!,"Well made, solid, very practical. sauce come out delicious. Retain all the flavors!!!I'll recommend this little pan too any one whose looking for good quality."
4,"not so much low carb, but smart carb","This is an excellent cookbook, first off it is all vegan so no dairy or eggs are used although she does mention that milk could be substituted for some recipies. I appreciate its vegan content since I am one, but I know that vegetarian meals can be heavy on dairy as well as typical low carb meals. I loved the tofu benedict and made three of the soups (amazing!) there are great side dishes and new ways to try different veggies. I think the sauces and condiments section are a real bonus in this book. If you are looking for more vegan low carb, I also recommend ""low carb vegetarian"" by Margo DeMello, a little less fancy meals, but we use more of them regularly (especially the *chicken* caesar salad).i also appreciate the thoughtful intro about good and smart carbs, since its pretty much impossible to sustiain healthy balance being vegan and truly low carb."
4,Excellent healthy cookbook for everyone,"If you are just looking for ways to make healthier meals for your family this is a winner whether you are a vegetarian or not. The premise of the book is to increase the whole grains, and decrease sweeteners and refined products. These suggestions are good for everyone.Being a numbers geek I appreciate that the book gives all the relevant nutritional information for each recipe. No matter what numbers you are monitoring the data is here for each dish.I particularly enjoyed the recipe for Chipotle Mashed Cauliflower. The Creamy Cucumber Dijon Dressing is also a very nice recipe. If you are looking for another way to get flax into your family I suggest the Apple and Oats Flaxjacks.Overall I got a lot of ideas from this book regarding how to increase the ""health factor"" in many of my family favorites. If you are interested in better health, this is a nice book to add to the cooking library."
5,Outstanding cookbook if you're a french-fry vegetarian trying to change your ways and be healthier,"I've been a vegetarian since I was 17 (am 24 now) and always found it hard to avoid eating way too much pasta, bread, and other starches. This cookbook has opened up a whole new world for my boyfriend and I, as we are trying to South Beach Diet. He loves this cookbook, and he's not even a vegetarian! I recommend the chili that uses red lentils (there are two chili recipes), and the Paglio e Fieno w/ Cashew Sauce recipe that uses thinly sliced and steamed zucchini and squash instead of pasta. Tonight we are making one of the Portobello Burger recipes. I can't wait!!"
2,too high carb for real weight loss,"Each soup alone has over 20g of carbs! And that's just for soup not a meal! To lose weight (not just maintain your current weight) you can only eat 20-30grams of carbs per day, not per meal.Most of these veggie cookbooks are for the rich anyway, a lot of the ingredients are only available at fancy-pants stores like whole foods. I hate to say it but diets like Atkins are within reach for low-income folks. Who has time (or money) to find something called 'mirin' whatever that is"
2,Nothing like the authors other books,"Having owned and enjoyed the authors other cookbooks, getting this one was an easy decision. The good reviews helped as well.After trying a few of the recipes, I call foul.Sauces with no thickening agent were runny, dressings were bland, and main entries that were just not palatable.I'll just tweak recipes from current cookbooks to make them low carb.Oh, and on a side note, it was interesting to note that on the authors web site, this title is not even mentioned among her many other, and delightful, books."
4,I like it!,"I just received this recipe book and have already identified a number of recipes for meals this week. The recipes contain ingredients that are easy to obtain in my somewhat rural area. I really like that the author provides the nutritional information for each recipe (including calories, fat, protein, carbs, fiber, cholesterol and sodium). Although I was looking for a low-carb vegetarian recipe book, I am also concerned with fat and cholesterol content and the recipes in this book also appear to be conscious of those as well. Lacto-ovo vegetarians could easily substitute regular cheese for soy cheese and add eggs to some of the recipes."
2,Complex and not time friendly,"I'm not sure what other people are looking for in a cookbook but for a busy mom like me this cookbook wasn't ideal, most of the recipes required 10+ ingredients many of which are not commonly found in the kitchen or grocery store. If you are the type of person who has unlimited amount of time to prep and cook your meals then this book would most likely be a great addition to your library but if you're like me and have only 20 minutes TOPS to get something in the oven or on the table then I'd suggest you look elsewhere."
4,Pretty good; wish recipes were faster,"I just got this cook book. Many of the dishes look very good. So far my husband and I have prepared two recipes; both were decent and we would make them again. The ingredients are very easy to find and are not too expensive.The recipes seem to pack a lot of nutrients, and more protein than I usually get, but they also seem like they do not have enough calories to keep a person alive... after each meal my husband is craving more food. Most ""main events"" have less than 200 calories per serving.Our main complaint is that these dishes are not ""quick and easy."" (Though the cook book didn't claim to be.) Usually we prefer dishes that can be cooked in under 30 minutes. A lot of these require 15-30 minutes of prep, and then 30-60 minutes baking/simmering. After a long day of work, we usually go for something faster, otherwise we're eating at 10pm. I've come across a couple that are faster, so they may be our repeat dishes.Overall, I like it."
4,the best one so far,"This recipe book isn't fantastic, but it is the best one I've found so far. A significant number of the main dishes have a decent balance of carb to protein ratio (not significantly higher carb than protein) which is hard to find in a low carb veggie recipe book. If anybody else knows of a better one with respect to that feature please respond below."
2,Ew!,"Every recipe I have tried thus far has been either 1) bland or 2) outright disgusting. I need to throw this book away before I waste more time and money on disastrous recipes.Silken Chocolate pie: NastyBlack Bean Dip: TastelessSkinny Dip: I cant believe this is considered food.One plus is that it inspired some great dishes. Since I don't eat eggs, high protein breakfasts are hard to come by. I made a tofu veggie casserole (not following the book's recipe, but rather the general concept) and it came out wonderful...but all in all this book has been a waste of money- beyond the purchase and shipping costs."
2,not enough calories,"This looked great at first... but then I started looking at the calorie counts for most of the dishes. Most of the Main Dishes have less than 200 calories, some have less than 100. I don't have time to cook and eat 8-10 meals per day."
1,Built like a 1980's American car!,"The machine was great while it worked. Just after the warranty expired my ""Ionic Breeze"" completely stopped working. For [the price] I expected quality!"
5,"Works great, but confused over the ozone issue.","I purchased two of the Ionic Breeze Professionals with the added ultraviolet bulb that help to kill bacteria. Based on the amount of black gunk that collects on the metal grids each time I clean it, it must be working. I have read the Consumer Reports that it emits unhealthy ozone and the air does have that after a thunderstome smell, but I have not experienced any breathing problems. My wife is a very heavy smoker (unfortunately) and I think these units are removing a lot of the tobacco smell and particulates. Some reviews say the ozone emitted is so low, it isn't really a concern anyway. Not sure who is right. I have found that the low odor water based Goof Off in the orange spray bottle cleans the black gunk right off the grids. Spray on, let it sit for a minute, wipe off with paper towels, rinse off with water and be sure all parts are completely dry before re-assembling and turning the unit on again."
1,Terrible,"We sent this unit out for testing at a leading test lab and they found that it would only be able to clean a very small closet - that is if you are looking to remove airborne particles like dust, smoke or pollen. It could help somewhat with odors due to the ionization process but that is very difficult to measure.I found more specific testing information at the [...]"
1,No good,How do people say this works? I would say this picks up 1/10 of 1% particles...at the most candle soot! I have owned mine for 1.5 years.Save your hard earned cash and seek other filters with Hepa.My opinion applies to all ionic breeze filters
1,Not dependable,"I agree that longevity is not in the design specs. I bought one and it worked for less than a year, got a replacement, and that one died even sooner. Didn't bother to replace that one. I also had two of the mini ones that plug into the outlet and have a light. One still working after quite a few years, the other, dead. 1 out of 4 is not very good. One note - it does seem to take odors out of the air. I have 4 cats and I think it helped somewhat, but not at the price they want for them. I would give $30 for a floor model if I thought it would keep running. As for cleaning the air - I don't think so."
1,Does almost nothing,"Electrostatically removing particles works okay, but it requires a fan to move air over the grille. As others have mention consumer reports tested this product at it removed almost nothing from the air. It rated the lowest out of all the air cleaners they tested.So don't waste your money on this product. If you want an electrostatic air cleaner find one with a fan. Before you buy you should really go read the online Consumer Reports report because a lot of air cleaners don't work very well."
5,Best Deal Yet,"Received the unit and the ad said ""like new"" - well it was definitely like new and works perfectly.Great buy."
1,Bad for me too...Loved it at first and now it just doesn't turn on!,"I really should have looked up people's reviews prior to purchasing this unit. Mine just stopped working. I cleaned out the inside with air, I've been cleaning the insert all along and it just stopped! What a waste of money. Haven't tried to talk to Sharper Image about it yet but I'm not hopeful."
1,Atrocious Russian Import! (Vinyl),"I waited for this record 5 months on backorder.What a whopping disappointment when I received it.It was pressed on transparent red vinyl, with chunks of recycled black vinylsprinkled throughout the record.Sound would drop out of the right channel, and I'd hear static.My goodness, never again. I'll settle for my CD now.""Vinyl Lovers"" is a record label to avoid.Equipment used:-Rega P7, Rega Exact cartridge-McIntosh C2300 preamp-McIntosh M252 amp-B&W; Matrix 801 series 3 speakersDigital Section:-Cheap Sony CD changer (coaxial out)-Musical Fidelity TriVista 21 DAC (coaxial in)"
3,Fresh Cream,"Fresh Cream being Cream's debut album and their 1966 release and is a mix of rock and blues-rock. The booklet contains no lyrics, but list whom plays what. I am not a great fan of blues music so therefore many songs sound alike to me. Allmusic gave it 4/5 which I find to be a bit high. 3/5."
2,2 Bluesy,"This album is wat too bluesy. I don't understand Eric Clapton's diabloical obsession with the blues. The blues is silly and outdated. So is this album. There are a couple of standout tracks, but most of it is just psychedelic blues. GIBBERISH! That's what most of this is! GIBBERISH! Who cares whether the blues dummy feels free or not? I for one, do not."
4,"Review of ""Fresh Cream""","This is a very good album. It was received as described, and I find the content to be very entertaining. It was, overall, a very good purchase."
3,"""Not Bad, but Not Great""","This is a good story for people interested in what went on behind the scenes in the music business at that time in it's history. Sammy Davis Jr. is surrounded by great actors Cicely Tyson and Ossie Davis, Unfortunately it does not improve his acting. Sammy Davis Jr. fans will love seeing Sam looking and sounding great. For people like myself who prefers good acting, it fell short. Not because of the story although I thought crawling on the floor was a bit much, but in Sam's performance. But do see it, because Cicely Tyson and Ossie Davis are superb. Louie Armstrong is also tearing it up with his horn as well."
2,Mel Torme steals the show!,"The best thing about this film is Mel Torme singing ""and All That Jazz"" with a group of swinging jazz musicians who have the whole club rocking. Mel's smooth-as-honey golden voice bounces through this joyous number with great verve and confidence as the camera pans over to a poster advertising The Supremes at Lincoln Center in 1965.Frank Sinatra, Jr. is cute and innocent sporting a pair of the most luscious juicy lips I've ever seen on a white boy. Are Sinatra and Sammy really playing those trumpets? Of course, Satchmo plays, sings, and acts his way into everybody's heart.It's good to see Cicely Tyson playing a girlie ""Audrey Hepburn"" role before she was typecast as Hollywood's ""strong black woman"".Unfortunately the story is weak, the lines are trite and the dialog sounds forced and over amplified...because of a cheap sound stage? ""A Man Called Adam"" looks and feels like an amateur budget film filled with some of the best talent in show business."
5,Left Unsaid is the best band ever!!!!,"If your into good ol fast, poppy, catchy punk rock buy this cd!! I've seen Left Unsaid play many times before & everytime it gets better and better!! This cd is pretty old & they really don't play all the songs off this cd that much anymore. I think they play about 3 or 4 of them. I must say all their new stuff is the best I've heard from them yet! but, until their next cd comes out buy this one. You won't be dissapointed. If you like stuff like strung out, blink 182, get up kids, unwritten law, face to face & and more you'll love this cd!"
4,Interesting perspective on anger when secular view isn't enough,"We are doing a neighborhood discussion group based on this book; all of us coming from different spiritual affiliations. I have heard the neighbors saying it is a fresh perspective since they mostly hear the secular pychological views. So, they are ready for a new perspective. I figured the 13 step was like the 12 step for Alcoholics and included a spiritual view. I am sure the author was not meaning to bate and switch; just simply trying to appeal to the masses of all affiliations and of all different levels of understanding trying to offer something different for people to consider. It has dramatically helped me."
1,sneaky christian alert!,"I bought this at a Barnes and noble, so I didn't have these reviews to guide me before my purchase.While I realize the irony in writing an angry review about an 'anger management' book, I am a little peeved that I when I bought this, it was, first of all, in the regular psychology section, and as I read the back, read the table of contents, and first few pages, NO WHERE was there any mention of it being a christian book!I felt pretty stupid when I got home started reading about how the evils of pornography and living a hedonistic lifestyle is contributing to your anger problems...What??? Next time I'll read the ""about the author"" section, which revealed it's written by a christian counselor....whoops.Just thought I'd give others a heads up on what they're buying, in case you flip through in a hurry like I did, and discover reading bible versus just makes you MORE angry, because that would just be counter-intuitive :)"
2,Maybe people wanting Christian therapy only would like it.,There was no information in the summary information on Amazon (and there is no information on the cover of the book) to tell you that this is a Christian oriented program. I like to separate my psychology and my spirituality. I was looking for something to use with clients who may or may not be Christian. It has many biblical quotes and refers to our innate or inborn sinful nature as being the cause of anger. It says that anger management is linked to spiritual stability.
4,The Anger Workbook,"The Anger Workbook is an excellent tool to use in groupswhere persons have anger problems. This could be used inrecovery groups, prisons, and large organizations where angeris a problem. I enthusistically recommend it!"
3,Not very helpful about Children's Anger Issues,"I agree with the previous reviewers that the cover blurbs don't reveal this book's heavily Christian slant. I picked it up because there is a chapter about dealing with children's anger issues, and I hoped it would help me with my frequently-angry 9 year old.The book's easy-to-scan layout made this chapter a quick read. The heading are insightful, for instance, ""Don't Be Threatened by Your Child's Anger,"" or ""Let Choices and Consequences Shape the Child."" However, I feel that the discussion in the text did not help with my particular situation. It might be useful for someone with a teenager or for someone worried about transmitting spiritual ideas to a child, but not for me, sorry."
1,"Misrepresented, wish I'd read the reviews before!","I am, ironically, angry, after browsing through the Anger Workbook! There was no indication it was Christian based and now I feel ...well angry!"
5,Life Changing,"This book has been life-changing. I bought it and am nowing buying a copy for my wife. If you reflect on the questions it asks you, you can learn a lot about yourself. I've been able to apply what I've learned about myself and anger management with my wife, kids, co-workers, customers, etc. I would highly recommend buying the Myers-Briggs temperment book, too. Together, these 2 books make for a powerful combination in learning about yourself and others."
1,Book is not appropriately labeled,"When I purchased this book, I did not read the fine print. There is no labeling whatsoever that this book is fundamentally Christian based. The only indicator is the very fine print on the back cover, which most people would probably not see when purchasing this book. The reasons for anger are in-depth and can easily relate to anyone's life, however, the solutions are not for everyone. If you are not a fundamental Christian, the book can be interpreted as insulting, as not everyone lives their life thinking that everything they do/think/feel/say is based in what the authors may call ""sin."" I wish I would have read reviews myself prior to purchasing this book."
4,Anger Workbook,Very good information. Very revealing to find anger issues buried deep inside. Christian based.
5,Anger Workbool,A friend suggested this book - I have gained a whole new insight to some of the issues I have been dealing with in my life. This book has helped me put a lot of my life experiences in perspective and has helped me understand myself and others so much better. Even if you don't think you have anger issues (which I didn't) this will definitely have an impact and be effective in understanding anger and it's complexities. A must read!!
1,Anger management book with christian agenda,"I was excited about reading this book as the text on the back and the information listed on the cover advised I would find answers on dealing with anger and ways to counter anger within yourself. I was dismayed to find that the book uses the bible to help resolve issues without going into greater detail within the book. I can understand how a christian viewpoint can be considered helpful, but was disappointed that the book makes no reference to the christian viewpoint on the back of the book. There is a brief reference in the acknowledgements about christian integrity in printing, but it is hardly sufficient notification prior to purchasing and reading the book. Unless you are looking for a book with a christian agenda on dealing with anger I would advise to pass on this book."
1,not what I expected,"I bought the book to help me understand someone who I feel has anger problems. After about two chapters, I determined it would not help me but decided to keep reading, hoping it would get better. For me, the book posed many causes of anger, but never did propose specific solutions. A lot of theories with no substance. I quit at page 178. I was able to tolerate the abundance of religious context, but when Dr. Carter put forth the proposition that criminal behavior is the result of environment rather than free choice, I closed the book forever."
1,a refund please,"If you want a book that's based on religion, not psychology and practical ways to deal with your anger (as I was expecting), then this book may be for you. If, like me, you want a book that deals with anger from a psychological/behavioural stand point, then look elsewhere, as (like me), you may be angered by all the biblical /God/Lord references in this book and find it better suited to kindling or the recycle bin....time for me to go find a 'real' book on this topic now...."
3,"A good book, but only for Christians","I pretty much second what the reader from California wrote. If you are Christian, I think you will really like this book. If you aren't, don't buy it."
2,Not Great,Not the best workbook I have seen. It is not very interactive either. It also has a lot of references to religion.
1,Do not be suckered!,"There is nothing in the title or on the cover to indicate that this is a book whose sole intention is to convert you to Christianity.The first two pages are about anger, but by page three you are being told that Jesus loves you.Sad, that religious people feel the need to deceive others in order to get out their message."
1,Page After Page of Christian Verbage,I ordered this book because I thought it would be helpful in my work with troubled adolescents at a non-denominational residential treatment center. Boy was I wrong! It seems like there's not one page without NUMEROUS references to bible passages! I couldn't even make sense of what the authors were trying to say when connnecting their points to stories in the bible. This book is useless for my work and now I can't even return it! It should have been made VERY clear on the description of this book that it is WRITTEN FROM A CHRISTIAN PERSPECTIVE! All the Minirth-Meier Clinic series books should have that label/caution on them.
1,Deceptive,"This book professes to be for all people, but is in fact, just for the devoutly religious. I could not finish it because it was so faith based, it made me sick to my stomach. Maybe some people can just give over control of their lives to God, but I cannot. I don't think that the reason for anger is our sins, as the previous reviewer has written, but I do think this book is deceptive. Nowhere on the cover does it mention that this book will try to get you to give your anger over to God and let him take care of you, but that is exactly what this book tells you. It is a total waste of money."
1,Deceptive,"Deceptive, this is a book with a strong religious content. It assumes the reader has a strong reliance in God to solve his/her anger issues."
1,Maybe it should be called The CHRISTIAN Anger Workbook...,"As thought Christians are the only ones who get angry... Or as though, if you want to work with anger more constructively, you ought to become a Christian... This book serves to put off many readers because of it's failure to be inclusive."
1,not a christian and can't use it in my work.,this book is for christians and i am not a christian. i cannot use this in my work as it is illegal for me to foster christian beliefs on my residential clients. i was very disappointed in it as it was noted nowhere it was christian based. i feel ripped off.
1,Too Christian,"I agree with the other people who thought that This book was too Christian. Neither the front nor the back of the book mentioned how Christian the book was. I would have returned it as soon as I realized, but I had already written in it (it is a WORKBOOK after all). I felt totally ripped off and let down"
1,Very Christian!,"I wish had thought to check out the reviews on a site such as this BEFORE I bought the book. Considering this is a work which is supposedly meant to help people overcome toxic anger, I imagine many people feel even more angry upon discovering the very heavy Christian slant of the book."
5,Great help!,"This book changed the way i veiw anger. Yes, i am a bible believing Christian and this book does use the bible as a source of reference. I learned so much about my anger and the anger of others. It encouraged me and gave me tools to work with to choose to control my anger. I can't wait to read their next book! I also understand how to respond better to angry people. It is a real eye opener!"
4,Helped me Greatly,"I turned to the Minirth-Meier series due to familiarity with them. I intentionally chose a book by Christian counselors. While even for me the book was a bit trite at times, its ability to force me into self-examination was very helpful. Through examples, questions and ""Do you react in the following ways"" type checklists I was able to see myself more clearly, and see the damage I was doing to my family. It helped me identify my emotional ""triggers"" and find realistic ways to manage and forsee situations that might set me off. Contrary to other reviews, I would not characterize the approach as simply ""give it over to God"". No, Carter and Minirth squarely placed the responsibility for change at my feet where it belongs, and helped me to see how to begin making the change."
2,Anger Management for Christians only,"As person who recently realized they have a problem with quiet anger I was heartened to find this book. The Description on the back cover seemed to describe a good methodology to work on anger management and the first chapter was encouraging.However, it quickly became evident that there was a lot of religious content in the book and in some cases it was counterproductive. Not all of us can simply believe that God made this so and we need faith to press on.There is a lot of good material in this book. However, after progressing a third of a way through it I simply couldn't take the religious references and leaps of faith the authors used to dilute what was a promising way of handling anger.An actively practicing Chrisian would probably find this book helpful. Anyone else should keep looking."
2,good idea's but has a religious context,I started reading and unexpectedly came across religious/Christian context. It was very off putting. Plus the book is a little out dated having a copyright from the 1990's.
4,Archery,This was a very good book on basic and advanced archery.Reading this as a beginner allowed me to start off right and lets me know all the good habits that I need to be a good archer.I've read it a few times and refer to it every few weeks to make sure I'm not slipping in to target panic.
2,archers bible,"the pages were seperating from the binder and the price on the cover was blackened out, small tear on front cover."
5,Sisal Brush,Ever want to scrub your back and you cant reach it? This brush does the trick. Although it takes a little time to get use to the stiffness it is well worth the effort. My skin has never been so soft!
4,"Works fine, could use a little longer handle w/curve","I really like the feel of the stiff brushes, but my arm reach isn't so great and have a bit of trouble getting to all of my back. Would like a bit longer handle and with a curve would definitly make it easier. Wood gets a bit funky also with age."
5,THE BETTER BRUSH,THE IS THE BEST BRUSH ON THE MARKET.AFTER CLEANING YOURSELF WITH THIS BRUSH YOU FEEL CLEAN' TRY IT YOU WILL LOVE IT.BUYING TWO MORE.OTHER BRUSHES WHERE TOO SOFT THIS BRUSH IS FIRM.
3,This is one intense brush,"The brissels on this brush were intense, do not scrub with this brush, it will scrub for you...other wise, it is made very well."
3,Not equal to same brush purchased a year earlier.,The brush head is slightly smalled and the brush itself is not as thick as previously purchased equal brush from same sales.
2,Review,"this brush is extremly hard, we cant use it and now the wood is getting black, keeping water insise.... is not good"
1,Get a grip,"The brush is stiff, I guess you get used to it. It has a long handle, compared to a hair bush? The handle is smooth and you cannot grip it when you are in the shower. It is anything but ergonomic. I guess you take a dry bath. Do not buy this brush unless you are needing to bristle off some very caked on dry skin or rust and can use a grinder to make the handle gripable. What a waste of good money."
1,STILL DON'T HAVE,"I never recd my merchandise , true enough no fault of this seller, it was my post office, but I nevertheless I don't have it!!I still like this seller and might purchase from them again in the future!"
1,Big Minus,This item is too short besides being too small. It doesn't fit well at all. At least it didn't cost too much.
2,POOR QUALITY,"THIS ITEM WAS POORLY MADE...VERY THIN FABRIC FOR TIGHTS, THE BODY SEAMS WERE TWISTED SO THE SUIT STRAPS DIDN'T LINE-U[ WITH THE BODY, WHICH MADE IT VERY UNCONFORTABLE TO WEAR. GREAT IDEA, OK PRICE BUT NOT THE QUALITY I EXPECTED. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS ITEM...."
4,Good Value,Good value and love the products. Bought as a gift for my Dad's birthday. recommend to anyone with a car they love.
4,Excellant value,"If you have to buy this individually at the auto parts store, it would cost much more. Mequiars is a good middle of the road car care product, cant go wrong."
1,Poor shipping,"Covers where not on tight, or taped, leaked all over everything, including the two video games they brilliantly packed with it and the polish does not come off easy, everything is slimey, never mind that half the bottle is empty. I thought it was a set in a gift box but it was just thrown in a regular box, tipped in every direction. The cloth and sponges also had product all over them. Very disappointed and I've always had great experiences with Amazon."
4,Not opened yet,This is a Christmas gift for my son. He has a very nice red truck and always keeps it looking nice
5,one of the best,What else can one say about Meguiars??Good products - always near the top of the line at a reasonable price.Great stuff for nearly everybody...
1,not satisfied,Packaged poorly......two bottles of the cleaning supplies were busted open.I had to throw away the entire order due to the other contents being drenchedwith the other chemicals. Very dissatisfied!!
2,missing instruction,"I used this product over the weekend and having problems with my eyes it was hard to read the back label. The company not including that normal one page instruction made it very difficult for me. In that case, I could have purchased similar item at Walmart and it would have been cheaper for me to return it if I was not satisfied. I would have sent this item back. However,shipping cost was too much."
3,Meguiar's Classic Wash & Wax Kit,Complete and cheap car care kit. Wheel cleaner not really necessary for me. Also the interior detailer bottle was broken when I received it.
1,disappointed,"This product was purchased as a gift, it was delivered in a plain cardboard box and the cleaning supplies was stuffed in the box with the sponge and cloths stuffed in between the bottles w/no information explaining the contents or use of the items,(If items were missing I do not know) and one of the bottles leaked inside the box. There was not enough time to return and get a replacement. I have purchased this product before and the product is not the problem, it is the way it was handled that made it an unpleasant experience."
1,Damaged Goods,I ordered the cleaning kit for a Christmas present. I opened it prior to wrapping it and it was a good thing! The bottles had leaked inside the box and there was a mess. I returned the products to Amazon and received my refund promptly and purchased another item...one that would not leak when shipped!
5,Great Collaboration of Products!!!,"This a great combo of cleaning/care products for my car. It was exactly what I was looking for. If you know what all these products are, then you will understand this is a great purchase. Everything included is really all that is needed for a perfectly clean car. The only thing missing is the bucket, water, and a good means of drying (I used one of those super absorbent towels rather than a chamois)."
4,Convenient,"Not certain if this is the best VALUE, but it was certainly convenient. The interior touch up spray is wonderful. Highly recommend Maguires products."
1,poor packaging,this the first time that i received a package like this...the car wax container was busted and it was all over the box. i was really disappointed. i dont know what to expect next time. such a waste...
5,Blows You AWAY!,"I live in Ecuador, South America.. and have partyed at the most awesome places all over the country, even HERE the song is a HIT !!! when this song comes on it blows EVERYONE away! This song WILL give you the chills and you wont stop movin' !!!"
1,Oh boy,"This song stinks! Trust me. Try your luck with the import single, maybe those remixes are actually worth listening to."
4,"In the Shade, again","After mentioning this book several times, and keeping us waiting, that she would fictionalize the whole theme and characters... came as a surprise. But then when you see how her series, Canopus in Argos, developed in a science fiction setting, you tend to understand that her best work , sometimes needs to come from a distance. That being said, this novel is a fulfillment of many loose threads, and themes that she, and we all, struggle and deal with in our own ways. Throughout her body of work, a life's work, she continues to keep her eyes open and focused on both the future, AND the past."
3,"Not particularly good, or bad","This book was released in Australia last year. Unlike most Lessing books, I found this 1 unremarkable. Overall, it reminded me of an angst-free 'The Four Gated City' (my favourite Lessing read). Compared with the 'The Four Gated City', instead of an island off the west(?) coast of Britain, we get impoverished AIDS-ravaged Africa. The African setting and characters are a stark contrast to the well-nourished middle class London characters - affecting."
3,Compelling but needs editing,"Structured in two sections set in London and Africa, The Sweetest Dream is an interesting chronicle of the turmoil of western ideology in the post-World War era. Lessing bitterly attacks the dogmatic views on communism and justice held by leaderships which were soon forgotten when they rose to power. Instead, her heroines are women (Julia, Frances, Silvia) whose political positions are not so defined but who rise above their circumstances to provide care and support to those around them. The section set in Africa is particularly intense and vivid. On the other hand, plotwise the story meanders too much and often loses focus, specially in the 60's part. I got the feeling that the novel would have improved with better editing."
4,Still in the Shade,"After mentioning this book several times, and keeping us waiting, that she would fictionalize the whole theme and characters... came as a surprise. But then when you see how her fictional series, Canopus in Argos, developed in a science fiction setting, you tend to understand that her best work , sometimes needs to come from a distance. That being said, this novel is a fulfillment of many loose threads, and themes that she, and we all, struggle and deal with in our own ways. Throughout her body of work, a life's work, she continues to keep her eyes open and focused on both the future, AND the past."
1,Bloody Awful,I found this novel to be cumbersome and uninspiring. There was not one likable character. I wanted to take Frances by the shoulders and shake some sense into her.
4,Best overall history of the conflict in one tome,"I have read several works on the historical roots of the conflict, but this book is probably the best overall history in one work. Morris does pretty well at taking an even hand with his writing; although he probably could have shortened it by a couple hundred pages by leaving out some of the ""breathless"" play-by-play commentary of battle tactics in the various wars. Overall, it is well worth the time invested if you want a better understanding of the subject."
5,"Balanced, Objective, Well Researched","I really enjoyed this one. I don't know where the other reviewers are coming from in calling it biased. I did not see that at all. Morris does not appear to be a fan of Ben Gurion, but he also did not give a lot of attention to the Israeli massacres in Lebanon. He is not into emotionalism in this book but more into just recounting the facts of history. This is not a book to build up one particular side or another on the issue. It is a good book to learn the actual history though."
4,Remarkable work of history,"Benny Morris rose to the forefront of Israel's 'New Historians' in the 1980's with the publication of 'Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem,' which provided radically new evidence which altered modern perceptions of the region forever. Morris retains his important findings in Righteous Victims and expands on them, covering virtually the entire history of the Israel-Palestine conflict. I found the earlier chapters leading up to the creation of the State of Israel on the earliest Zionist settlers to be particularly interesting; Morris presents a picture which indicates that the current bloodshed is by no means a product of natural necessity. The ethnic cleansing of Palestine and subsequent military occupation is the cause. However, Morris becomes overly ideological in the concluding sections of the book, allowing his harsh realist politics to creep in. Nevertheless, this is arguably the most comprehensive single volume about the history of the conflict."
2,re-wrapped oozing cheese,"Lovely sentiment, not what was expected, though. Somehow thought the cheese would be in a gift box similar to the one shown, not just stuffed into dismal styrofoam. I'm not certain what to make of the leaking eplorateur that was rewrapped in some plastic wrap....hmmm..wonder if it was shipped out that way or someone had opened the container -it's below freezing here, so doubt it ""thawed"" en routewill probably go out for dinner or to the jeweler next year"
3,Melted Cheese... but Customer Service was good,"I was disappointed to get the cheese melted in the box upon arrival - it made quite a mess. Informed Customer Service and they sent another cheese right away. Unfortunately, it was even more melted the second time. Igourmet did reimbuse for the one cheese variety that melted... I was still stuck cleaning up the mess of melted cheese on the other two warm varieties. Perhaps not a good idea for anyone in a hot climate... especially if your ordering for a special occasion."
1,Awful Product,"This was an incredibly bad product. Yes, it has a chamber for water... why I do not know, because it NEVER produced steam! If you want something to curl your hair with steam, I suggest a Caruso Professional SalonPro 30 Molecular Steam Hairsetter."
4,amazing cd,"This cd is definitely one of the heaviest, most brutal in my collection. Im not exactly sure what these guys are classified as, but I would say they are closer to death metal than hardcore. the vocalist constantly switches between a deep, low growl and a throaty, hardcore style scream. the music itself is blazingly fast and punishing, with blast beats and breakdowns galore. they also put on an amazing live show. my only problem with this album is the filler track (i think its #5). its slow and kind of kills the albums momentum. its the only reason i couldnt give the album 5 stars. but FTiRD is still more than worth picking up"
5,Just pure insanity on a small disc with a hole in the middle,"I downloaded Dreaming in Dog Years about a week ago now, just to get a sample of these guys. It starts with a little drum beat, very soft, quite innocent. Just before the fastest vocals I've heard explode from my speakers. It's no exaggeration to say that I actually jumped. It was just what I'd been looking for. These guys have some of the heaviests songs ever written, but still keep an intelligence about them that is welcome. They even manage to be catchy. Just see if your not singing ""It's not gonna be allright, and it's not gonna be OK"" to your local corner shop owner as you buy your morning mag. Highlights are: Dreaming in Dog Years, That Certain Special Ugly, Catalepsy and Like a Train Through a Pigeon. Rock on to y'all."
5,A great book,I am 11 and this book has helped me tremendously. I believe it has saved me a lot of trouble in the future. Even the delicate subjects are explained in a way the does not make you shudder. J ames has written many other great books. My mom has bringing up boys. It was hard to put this book down. I read it in 3 days. It is the best six dollars and forty four cents I have ever spent.
1,Utter drivel,"What a piece of derivative garbage. 311 already made this album and made it better years ago. Give up now and focus on the homework, kids. This music is taking to straight to the unemployment line."
3,"nice, but I've seen better","The statue was nicely put together. The paint colors were good. I was hoping for a better statue though as I have a ""Florentine collection"" one at home that I am comparing it to, which is beautiful. Hard to compete with one that I really like. This one is rougher and not as professional-looking. Not bad, just not wonderful either."
4,Send Your Love,"A worn stylus ruined my first aurra album, I'm so glad to get it again on CD before it becomes no longer available.These songs are truly a classic."
4,Aurra = BASE LINES!,"""Are You Single"" has the best base line I've yet to hear today, and I'm 44. That track alone is worth whatever amount you pay for the project. My cassette melted in 1980 and I have just now found my replacement in 2004! THANK YOU"
1,I was expecting different,The music is too loud for me but I will send to to friend like that type of stuff
1,Worthless Coffee Pot,"I bought this product to have a small coffee pot in the office. However, when brewing, this pot somehow always gets significant amounts of coffee grounds into the pot, regardless of how the filter is arranged. Total waste of money, I'll be throwing this away and buying another."
1,Mr coffee let me down,"I bought this coffee pot for my mom for Christmas because she has one just like it from the 80's but it looks awful, this is the 2nd mr coffee 4 cup pot that I bought for her and they both don't heat water hot enough to brew the coffee, the coffee always turns out weak tasting, she tried using a dark roast and still no flavor, never will I buy me coffee again"
4,4 cup coffee maker,A nice small coffee maker for the one coffee drinker in this household. My only complaint is that it does not seem to turn off automatically.
3,Coffee maker,This small Mr. Coffee is perfect for the 2 of us. Hard to find one this good and small enough to meet needs.
1,It's heat plate grows rusty within few month.,"Two years ago, I brought it and like it. I drink coffee in the morning, so only used it only once a day. Few month after I brought it, its heat plate started growing rusty. I continuely used it for additional six month when the 50% heat plate was rusted. I thought it was an incidence, so I threw it away and brought the same model again. Nine month late, 20% heat plate is rusted.... This time I don't think it is a incidence again."
3,"Good Concept, But Somewhat Weak Design","These things don't work as well as they should, but they do take out random crap from the air. If you don't like buying stuff to smell your car up like fruitiness, a HEPA filter or something would be what you're looking for. Unfortunately, I don't think they make car HEPA filters. This product is the next best. Besides, it's completely silent unlike HEPA's. Don't expect a miracle, but buy it if you find a good deal."
1,don't waste your money,"i thought, 'ionic breeze for you car, great idea!'. and that's all it is, a great idea. this is nothing like the home unit. there is so much air moving throughout the car cabin at any given time, this product has no noticeable effect to the air quality. you would need some sort of blower/fan on this for it to be effective and coils would have to be much, much bigger.replace your cabin air filter if you want a noticeable difference in the air quality inside your car."
4,What a great product!,"We received on time...number 1. Number 2 we really like this. My girls, ages 9 and 10 are in soccer and the day they got it they spent 2 hours using it. Even my 6 yr old boy uses it and thinks it is awesome. The velcro straps that hold the ball in place are well made. It does take about 3-5 min. to put the straps around the ball depending on if the straps have been tangled with or not. Other than that...great product. I used it myself and it gives you a good workout and helps with coordination of the ball and ball contact reflex."
3,Good,"This was a good buy. We had a little trouble with getting the ball in the middle of the harness, but it's working out ok."
5,William Powell Myrna Loy Collection,What could be better than a set of great movies from two great stars!This is a wonderful collection. I hope more sets like this are on the wayfor those of us who love good movies.
5,the best couple,"powell& loy, they are the quintessential couple--ever! they have the best chemistry. watching them act is like seeing astaire & rogers dance, effortless. whoever their co-stars are, they are still as one. I hardily recommend this multi-dvd ensemble. these films are meant to enjoy, over & over again. you won't be disappointed!"
5,Throw back movies,Good movies to bring back old memories! These actors are legendary and having this product at such a good price made my purchase even better.
5,The Amazing Amazon,I am very pleased with this box set. It was delivered sooner than expected and the quality of the DVDs is excellent. The box set has given me many hours of viewing pleasure. It was certainly money well spent! Congratulations Amazon on your superb service!
5,CD's,"Love this series. I got them quickly, still watching them from time to time. Good deal, good service.word word"
5,Great gift for my wife.,Myrna Loy and William Powell had such great screen chemistry that this set of films was a no-brainer. I bought my wife The Thin Man collection previously. These films have that Loy-Powell chemistry in different settings. My wife loved it.
1,Don't Buy This Book! It will Scare the Wits Out of You!!!!!!,"There are plenty of other great books on parenting twins & other multiples out there -- do yourself a favor & don't buy this one! First of all, it is very technical & difficult/unpleasant to read. Second, it has pictures of women after childbirth with like several feet of hanging extra skin -- not something I needed to see when I was emotional and pregnant with two. It also had the most negative, scary tone. It seemed to tell you all of the things that could go WRONG and very little of what could go right. Let me tell you, from a woman who has been there -- it can go beautifully & without incident -- & not everyone ends up with miles of extra skin on their stomachs. If you buy this book while pregnant, it will only serve to scare the wits out of you. Save yourself the stress and look elsewhere for good information!"
1,Very bizarre one-sided perspective,"I've read most of this book and the more I've read the more bizarre it is. Noble claims that hypertension, anemia, and gestational diabetes are natural aspects of pregnancy that can be harmful if treated. She says bedrest is actually harmful, that ultrasounds increase fetal mortality and left-handedness (???) and a host of other claims. She implies that those carrying multiples many years ago gave birth to healthy 7-lb each infants with none of the problems that some of us having multiples face today. She is an advocate for veganism, water births, home births, doulas and midwives and avoiding pain meds. Though my twins are big and healthy I certainly didn't take the advice in this book.This is not medically sound advice nor is it objective or open-minded. It is a book of extreme views."
1,Scared me to death!,"This book had me convinced that amy twins would have some type of birth defect, or that something would go wrong with my pregnancy, labor, or delivery. I read this when I was on bedrest, and finally had to remove it from my room because it scared me too much. The author seemed only to concentrate on what could go wrong with a twin pregnancy. I would recommend the only other twin book I read - ""Keys to Parenting Twins."" It's much more positive! By the way, my twins were born completely healthy & normal at 36 weeks."
2,Outdated,This was the first book that I bought when I found out that I was expecting twins and I found it to be outdated and full of a lot of biased information. The author has her own thoughts about what type of diet you should eat and advocates natural childbirth but doesn't provide a very comprehensive point of view to assist those that may not want to experience childbirth the way that she has. If you share her views then this book will be very helpful to you.I also tried contacting a lot of resources at the back of the book and found most of the numbers to be disconnected.
1,It scared me to death!!!!,"I do not recommend this book at all. There is way too much discussion of what can go wrong and too much ""new age"" philosophy that is very strange to me. Elizabeth Noble is under the impression that she had a twin that died in utero and that influences the way she has gone about writing this book. This is very scary reading for any woman pregnant with twins."
1,I would NEVER recommend this book!,"This was the scariest book on twins that I read. If you want to be afraid to eat, sleep or breathe during your entire pregnancy than this is your kind of book. Almost every chapter focuses on a negative aspect of carrying more than one baby and there are more chapters on what can go wrong than what to do to help things go right."
1,Focuses on the negative,"Having just been told I was expecting twins, I was keen to find a book that could give me the information and reassurance that standard, ""singleton"" pregnancy books could not. But instead of finding useful information and reassurance, I finished this book feeling anxious and alarmed. It focuses far too much on the negative aspects of having twins - loss of one twin, preterm labor, birth complications, vanishing twin syndrome, etc. It is daunting enough being pregnant with twins without reading a book that reminds me of all the things that can go wrong. In addition, the author offers impractical advice on nutrition and exercise, which in many cases is contrary to advice from the medical profession. Not everyone has the money or the desire to eat seaweed and other ""macrobiotic"" health store food. All in all, I would not recommend this book to any woman expecting twins. It is alarmist and out-of-touch with real pregnant women."
2,Not What I Expected,"Finding out I was pregnant with twins was moving, exciting, shocking and scary. I wanted a book that would help me understand how my pregnancy would be different to a singleton pregnancy, what to expect and some guidelines on how to look after myself. Although the book was informative and I loved the little comments made my mothers of multiples in the borders I didn't feel satisfied. I was more worried than before as the book goes into so much detail about the loss of a twin (this was the majority of a book) and premature labor. It started out good explaining the types of multiples and how common they are (or not) was interesting but there were very few pictures and I found it to be quite long winded. I must say that although this book was informative I felt more worried and anxious for my twins after reading it than before and was left still not knowing what to expect during my pregnancy."
5,What to expect when you're expecting...MORE THAN ONE!!,"The first thing to buy after the doctor says...""I think I can hear another heartbeat!"" Twin pregnancies ARE different, and as a recent twin Mom, I relied on it from beginning to end of my pregnancy...right to 38 weeks, with over 14 pounds of combined birthweights. It's a great book."
2,Oh my...,Quite old and outdated. Had to laugh at some things in this book. Please go with a newer version from this century:-)
1,depressing and scary,"I read this book while I was pregnant with my twin daughters and found it incredibly depressing and scary. It was filled with morbid quotes from parents who had a bad outcome, along the lines of, ""when not even one of the triplets lived, I went out and got drunk,"" and seemed to dwell on every possible problem and complication to the point that I was quite stressed and anxious when in fact, my twins were born naturally, five days before the predicted due date, had none of the complications this horrible book made me worry about, and were in excellent health. In fact, I so dislike the book that I go out of my way to warn expectant parents of twins to avoid it. In addition, the dietary advice is ridiculous and it's impossible for even a hearty eater to consume the massive amounts of food this writer claims are necessary to having a healthy baby. So, unless you like being scared, I recommend against buying this book."
2,Not romantic enough,This could have been a good book but the writer puts in child rape which is gross and doesn't have the couple together enough. Teh war is used to take up space and the romance with the slave couple was more believable. Not enough passion and does not cover the war very well
2,Below average historical romance,"As a reader of historical romance, a civil war buff, and a fan of the Outlander series author Diana Gabaldon, who once recommended this book on her web site, I came to this novel fully expecting to like it. I was severely disappointed. This is a middling, at best, romance novel with a pedestrian plot, predictable characters, and a hero and heroine who couldn't be more representative of all that's tedious in the genre. The author seems sincere and there's a sense that she did her civil war era research, but the book holds no surprises and little inducement for the reader to continue past the first few chapters.If you're going to write a novel about another spirited, plain but beautiful, impoverished girl-woman who makes a marriage of convenience with a gorgeous, tortured, secretly-sensitive man who-pretends-to-hate-but-really-loves-her than it better be exquisitely plotted and beautifully written. This book is neither."
3,so so cleaner,"If you're expecting the strength of a real steam cleaner in this little package, don't bother. It does an okay job of steaming things, but a pretty poor job of sucking up the wet mess you've just melted off your carpet. Not particularly strong, but easy to use."
4,Glad i ordered it!,"I recieved my steam Wizzard vacume yesturday and I sooo Glad I ordered it. The steam at first takes a bit to get started and it does drip water out (when ur done steaming use the vacume to clean up the water that dripped out :) thats what i did)while its warming up but when the water is warm enough the steaming works great i used it on my couch to remove an accident left by my neice. Steamed it, vacumed it and it came out very well!"
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"There isn't very much steam, very little pressure, and it isn't very hot. The steam doesn't even come out in a single stream: it kind of ""chugs"" its way out. I've used a steamer before - a little handheld one - and the steam was much hotter under much higher pressure, and much more plentiful. The salesman assured me that this would work just like the other steamer I'd used, but with the addition of a vacuum. This was completely untrue. The unit also feels clumsy to use. I find it heavy and the water tank is far too small."
1,Do not waste your money!!!,"I bought this product thinking that for the price it would work wonders - boy was I wrong!!!! Sharper image claims that the steam option alone on the machine takes stains out of your carpet - you don't have to resort to carpet shampoos - what a joke!!! I have tried to get out an assortment of stains from my carpet, from dirt to wine, and I am disapointed every time! I have had cheaper steamers that did a better job then this product. The only thing that does work on this item is it's vacuum power."
1,How can I rate something...........,"How can I rate something that I did not receive. Yes, I did order Michael Omartian, but received Randy Waldman....and to my surprise, I do enjoy it.....soothing, mesmerising....totally enjoyable. In other words it has become an enjoyable mistake. I hate it and have given it one star, because it is not what I wanted."
4,"A great helmet, so light!","This is the most comfortable helmet I've ever owned, its so light I forget I'm wearing it. The chin strap is comfortable and the headlamp clips are a nice plus. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the size adjustment system doesn't seem as comprehensive as in other Petzl helmets I've owned (an adjustment in the back is the only available). This hasn't been a problem yet but it may be once I start wearing a winter beanie with it as ice climbing season starts. Otherwise great helmet!"
1,superlight but useless,It is impossible to tighten this product easily. You should have four hands to be able to tighten it symetricaly.
2,Too cheap for the price,"And when I say cheap, I mean 'low quality'. Ordered this and was surprised to find that it's nothing more than a cheap, low-grade bicycle helmet- something you might pay $29 for at Wal-Mart. My old $49 Trek biking helmet is much better quality.What else?-It didn't fit well.-My bike helmet has a one-handed adjustment for size... this doesn't. That small detail makes a difference if you're wearing a cap or not in changing weather conditions.-The chin-strap buckle is small and flimsy.Pulled it out of the box, looked at it, tried it on and packed it up to send right back."
4,Detecto 437,I have found this scale to be very accurate and reliable. I can recommend it to anyone who needs an accurate weight check.
5,weigh in here,"The Doctor/Physician Scale I purchase had very little assembly needed and directions made it very simple to put together. As for the delivery time from this seller, I expected to receive it between 5 and 12 days and was very pleasantly surprised to receive it within 3 working days. I would use this seller again with no hesitation.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FGDXL2/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
1,Poor,It comes with no instructions as to how to set the scale corectly. Nothing. The scale is not accurate I believe because we don't know how to set it correctly.
5,Great Scale A++,I have sons that wrestle. They need a scale that they can depend on. They check there weight multiple times a day. It was easy to put together and is very accurate would highly recommend.
2,Poor Quality,"This did not work very well, at all. I ended up throwing it out after a very short period of time. I would go with the Health o meter!"
3,the column is wobbly,"I always wanted one of these, and I have enjoyed having it. The only problem I have with it is that the column is wobbly, and I wasn't able to get it to tighten up. This causes the weight to vary as much as two pounds if I am not careful about how the column is leaning (or not leaning). It helps that the balance can be adjusted to correct to zero."
4,detecto scale,"THIS WEIGHT SCALE WAS JUST WHAT I WANTED . IT WAS EASY TO SET UP AND USE . THE SHIPPER WAS VERY FAST IN GETTING IT TO ME , AND OVER ALL I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE ."
2,Inconsistent quality in Whistler model line,"I have owned for the past 2 years the 1753 Whistler. The 1773 I just purchased gives numerous false alarms, during an alarm, the unit jumps between K and KA band voice warnings, and this is in the most filtered City 2 mode. I can't say I recommend this unit. Although this model was more expensive than most others I have seen and used, it is not as good a performer."
2,it make noise that's all its good for,"Do not purchase this piece of whistler garbage its cheap for a reason I used it for 1 year long distance and regular city driving, I can visual see the cops before it goes off lots of false alert but very few true alerts your better off steering clear of whistler products period."
5,Pyramid Life,"Provided that Pyramid is heard, then it will be a modern string quartet classic. Duval and company lay out different and ever shifting layers of music that terrify and bewilder the listener to the point of how do they do this? The reward is a punishing thematic piece that lays out new territory between modern classicism and jazz, where some terrifying solos result."
5,"If it is heard, then it will be a classic.",Duval and company knock out something special on this recording. An improvised theme runs throughout the cd the leads the musicians into fascinating and terrifying solos. Pyramid finds some new and interesting territory that fills a space between improvisation and modern 12 tone classicism. Under the Pyramid should be destined to be a modern string quartet classic.
2,Not for the faint of heart.,"This was very gory. I got it for my husband, as he is an avid snowmobile rider. After watching part of this... I don't know if I'll ever let him go to the mountains with his buddies, without supervision, anymore.... LOL"
2,"Stiff, uncomfortable",The soles and laces of these sandals do not flex with your feet. Says it is leather but the laces feel like plastic. Very uncomfortable especially for dancing. Thin soled or would be good for every day use.
4,A great ladder,"If you want to purchase the Little Giant ladder as seen on TV, watch out. The one advertised on TV has a 300 lb. rating and is classified as industrial grade. This one has a 250 lb. rating and is classified as a household rated one. All in all, both are excellent. This one weighs about 6 lbs. ligher than the industrial grade model. In addition, for those struggling with its weight, you could break it down to two ladders and save your back."
2,Little Giant Ladder,Pros: The concept is very good.Cons: Is over priced The ladder is very heavy and hard to adjust to certain positions because of the weight. Weight hampers carrying it around easily. If I had it to do over again I would not buy it.
2,something fishy about the prices here,"List price over $500, $300 here. That would sound good--except this exact ladder (Type 1, 22 foot, model 10303) is only $259 at the Little Giant website with free shipping, $249 from Home Depot again with free shipping. So the 'free work platform' is actually costing $40-$50 dollars...which is not exactly a bargain.I did eventually get one of these ladders and as long as you don't mind the weight (too much for my wife) they are amazingly convenient."
1,Check the rating,Review says the 303 is rated to 300 pounds. Not true - it's only rated to 250 pounds.
2,A half painted room is a sad sight.,"My wife started painting our family room after I ordered my ladder, confident that it would arrive in about 3 weeks, just in time to reach the high parts of the wall by the stairs. The other 3 walls were finished but still no ladder. After about a month I went back to check my order to make sure I hadn't accidentally checked 'Wells Fargo Wagon' as the delivery method. Nope, it said 'UPS' as I had remembered. The ladder was finally shipped more than 7 weeks after it was ordered and arrived quickly. Now we can finish the job.This ladder is everything you would want 1) Made in the USA (similar ladders by Cosco, Werner and Gorilla Ladder are made in China) 2) Flexible (any configuration from step ladder to extension ladder) 3) Stong (it feels safe even when fully extended)."
3,Overhyped,"First, the ladder took over a month to arrive from Amazon. Second, the product either sat in a dusty warehouse or was actually used-it had some dings and dirt on it! It is not as easy to manipulate as the some would have you belive and is heavy to carry around. BUT, when you use it, it does feel steady and it can replace several ladders. Overall, I think it's overpriced and arrived in poor condition for an item purchased as new. On the plus side, it does take up less room for storage and can fucntion as a step ladder or a tall extension."
3,"Overpriced, overhyped, underbuilt, and RIPPED OFF!","First off, make sure you CONFIRM with Amazon that it does come with a work platform. They shipped mine without and then said the web info was wrong. I went nuclear and they finally refunded 20 bucks on what is a 40 dollar accessory. I felt ripped off. Now for the ladder. It is the Class 1 250 pound ladder, not the 300 they push on TV. DON'T BUY THE CALSS 1 unless you 1.) weigh less than 175, and 2.) don't need to go above 12-14 feet or so. Then it seems sturdy. Above those limits it flexes and feels like it will snap. Other than that, it is a well built and neatly engineered unit that is too much money for the strength that you get. I wish I had bought the 300 lb. version and that Amazon hadn't defrauded me on the platform. Then I'd probably be happy."
4,little giant ladder review,"Ladder folds well, has a cool design. It does feel a little rickety, maybe the one for more weight is better."
3,Not Queen's BEST but it's QUEEN!!!,"As a huge Queen fan I will say this is not my favorite Queen CD. It's not the rock and roll they were known for and I know that disappointed some of their fans. But one of the best things about Queen was that they were so completely over the top that they had the b#*ls to take a break from their usual sound(as much as I love their R&R) and give this a shot. Even though it's not my personal favorite, I have to give them a big thumbs up for trying something new. And after Hot Space was all said and done they still rocked!!"
4,"Not the best, but very good work","First of all, I have to say that I don't like disco music. Well, I've bought this album and I don't think I've made a mistake. I must admit that there is some I don't agree with (Body language - Freddie, what were you thinking about! ) but, besides Under pressure, Put out the fire and Las palabras de amor, some songs are real good stuff, such as Back chat and Life is real. Moreover, everybody has to admit that the songs are not skunky disco stuff, because in them there is a lot of hidden good ole rock."
3,Not as bad as everyone says it is.,"Don't believe all the bad press about this album. Okay, so it's not thier best,and they shouldn't have experimented with disco at all, but there are a few good songs in it ie. Put out the Fire, Life is Real, Under Pressure, Las Palabras De amor, Action this Day.It' still worth the money folks!"
3,"It's rather bad, yes but not that bad!!!","When Queen was working on this album they were trying something new, like U2 on POP. But the results are not so quite good! But there are some good songs here: Los Palabras De Amor (The Words Of Love, Under Pressure, Life Is Real, Cool Cat and Put Out The Fire. The rest is forgettable! If you are new to Queen, then buy A Night At The Opera or A Day At The Races."
4,Soooo Bad..... I love it!!!,"Please, for your own safety, dont listen to this album without listening to Queen or QueenII. That might ruin your impression of the gretest band in the world. This album is so exceptionally bad it turns right around and becomes good. These songs are so horribly un-Queenlike, i was rolling around on the floor laughing. Now if you'll excuse me, im going to dance around the room to staying power..."
1,Disco Queen,"Queen loved to experiment. Every time they released a new song, I would hear it and say (in delight), ""Is that Queen?"" However, this album abandoned all that was Rock and Roll and gave into the pop craze of disco that can only be classified as the dark ages in pop music. The only bright spot from this album was ""Under Pressure."" Thankfully, they pulled out of it to cement themselves as one of the greatest rock bands of all time."
2,can`t give more than 2 stars,"I can`t tell you how disappointed i was when i bought this album back in 1982. Since then the musical landscape has changed a bit but it`s still pretty bad in my opinion . Worst tunes are Staying power, action this day, Body language. Some songs are quite agreeable like Back Chat (sounds a bit like Diana Ross`s ""upside down"")""Las Palabras"" is a nice ballad Under Pressure is still a great number which was originally written for the Greatest Hits album(1981) and therefore it sounds like a stranger on this record."
1,"Not good, but even bad Queen has its pleasures","Let's face it, Hot Space is filled with filler. But if you love Queen, and I indubitably do, you'll find several splendid touches. But you have to go mining for them...rather than having them explode into you, as great Queen so incomparably does. We must come out of denial and admit that this album is weak gruel, with more than a few good moments floating in it. But it is Queen, and even bad Queen has its pleasures."
1,Ugh. This is horrible,"I'm shocked at all the good reviews I'm seeing! I'm a huge Queen fan, and have been since 1980. Day at the Races is wonderful. The Game is a classic. Night At the Opera is quirky, but still a good listen. But Hot Space is atrociously bad. Let me repeat that: atrociously bad. It sounds like somebody fooling around with a drum machine who didn't realize they were being recorded. It's a bad karaoke nightmare.Admittedly, yes, Under Pressure is a great song. But it couldn't possibly be more out of place unless it were included on a Megadeth CD. Really, it's that bad. Am I making myself clear? :)"
3,"The weakest Queen album, but with a few merits","Hot Space is usually criticised by Queen fans of being too 'pop' and electronic. This is true to a large extent, but the cheesy sounds should not stop you listening to a few of the gems this album contains. Everyone knows 'Under Pressure', but other notable tracks include 'Las Palabras De Amor' (a great ballad), 'Put Out The Fire', and 'Calling All Girls', which are rocky little numbers. I would recommend this album to Queen fans who are prepared to give it a try - you shouldn't regret buying it if you can cope with the few cheesy songs."
3,"I love Queen, but...","This is the only Queen that I cannot stand to listen to from beginning to end. (Ok Flash Gordon is worse, but I don't count it as a real Queen album). It sounds like they let the success of ""Another one Bites the Dust"" go to their head, then drenched it in synth-pop. Luckly songs like ""Put out the Fire"", and ""Under Pressure"" save this album from just being bad."
1,Should have never been made,"Just stick to rock. No experimentation please. That's not what Queen's music is about. Queen, Zeppelin, The Doors, Jethrotull...the ROCK man. Party on bud, but no funk."
2,hOT sPACE rEVIEW,"There is very little to recommend this album to anyone other than a true die-hard Queen fan. It is laborous and disconnected. The ""hits"" that came from it are good but not plentiful enough to justify the completed work"
4,not bad,"hot space isn't as bad as people say. It was the weakest queen album to that point but it doesn't desearve the bashing it got. staying power and backchat are quite good. On the second side the good songs are action this day, life is real, coolcat,and words of love,and the classic under pressure. I feel body language is ok, but it was the worst single and mistake Queen ever put out. I don't think Queen ever recovered from that mistake in america. radio stations didn't want anything to do with queen after that single, despite alot of great 80's music from Queen. If your a new queen fan this isn't a place to start, save this album for later, but if you have an open mind to music you'll realize there's lots of interesting and fun music to be heard here."
4,"A colorful and vivid album, just like the&#65279; 80s ! !","Queen played in 1982 with new sounds; The result was an entertaining record, however much called die hard fans criticized it."
2,Not Very Queen,What can you say? Doesn't even sound like Queen in some places. A bit too much disco. There are a couple of good songs though. But this is my least liked Queen album apart from Flash Gordon sound track.
2,Misfire,"Like all great Rock Groups who made several albums together Queen had some misfires. Hot Space is one such misfire. After the excellent The Game provided Queen with a major disco style hit in Another One Bites The Dust Queen decided they would make an album largly steeped in a Dance/Disco sound but the songs are not as good. This album fails with the exception of the songs that do not take this approach Life Is Real, Under Pressure, Los Polabras De Amor, Calling all Girls and Put Out The Fire."
1,An embarrassment,"I am a big Queen fan, and this cd is their worst ever. Why they put it out instead of taking a sabbatical is beyond me...The only decent songs are Under Presuure - even if the live versions tend to put the studio one to shame, and Put Out The Fire. Maybe Life Is Real could be saved from the bonfire as well. The partially Spanish-sung Las Palabras de Amor is pretty silly. I am Spanish but have always found appalling the knack of foreign artists to try and record in my language because the lyrics lose a lot and sound silly.All in all, do not buy this if you consider yourself a Queen fan, unless you're the blind-faith kind, which is notrecommendable. You'll find yourself cringing more often than not if you listen to it..."
4,"Even when they're mediocre, they're still good","Queen moves forward into the dance rave scene of the times of the 80's. It's not that bad considering. Just don't expect the heavy rock of early Queen here. It's all enjoyable, Freddie's ""Song for Lennon"", ""Put out the Fire"", ""Calling All Girls"" and ""Under Pressure"" are among their best. Remember, a mediocre Queen album is still better than no Queen album and even a mediocre Queen album is better than most bands could dream of producing."
4,Queen fan? Give it a chance!!,"I know, I read all the reviews of this album as well and thought to myself that this album was probably going to be an embarracement to Queen and that I would also feel embarraced listening to it. However, after purchasing the ""Queen Live at the Bowl"" DVD, upon hearing ""Action This Day"", ""Back Chat"" and ""Staying Power"" my mind changed rapidly. I went out to buy Hot Space and have never looked back. It's now one of my favourite Queen albums. If you love Queen, you'll love this album just as much as the others. Sure, Queen experimented with a few new sounds, but in my opinion that was not a bad thing to do at all. Don't just think that because certain people don't like it because it's slightly different, that you shouldn't consider getting it!"
3,Queen - 'Hot Space' (Virgin),"Originally released in 1982,this was Queen's official follow-up to '80's 'The Game' lp.I remember that when this album first came out,it would appear that many long-time fans had lost interest in Queen.I do KNOW that their summer,1982 trek of the U.S. was indeed their last tour here.This effort really isn't that bad of an '80's album rock lp.Best track here,hands down is the awesome ""Put Out The Fire"".Also decent is the lp's single ""Body Language"",the straight-ahead rocker ""Action This Day"" and their memorable collaboration with David Bowie ""Under Pressure"".Enjoy."
3,It freaked me out,"If you're used to and love Queen's Greatest Hits I and II and are familiar with Queen's well known and classic stuff, this cd might not be for you. Its heavy on disco and doesn't really sound like queen that much at all. There are some good songs like put out the fire and the Song for Lennon is interesting and good, but if your looking to buy an original queen album, i'd skip this one and get something like Night at the Opera."
4,"Different, but still enjoyable....","Hot Space is not the same style as the other queen albums, but they just tried an other style, to see it's success. Not as succesful as they thought, but it is a good album. Songs like Staying Power, Action This Day, Put Out The Fire and others just may not be called worthless. Cause they aren't. Let's see how I rate the songs:Staying Power: 8/10Dancer: 8/10Back Chat: 6/10Body Language: 7/10Action This Day: 8/10Put Out The Fire: 8/10Life Is Real: 7/10Calling All Girls: 7/10Las Palabras De Amor: 9/10Cool Cat: 6/10Under Pressure: 7/10 (I know this is their greatest hit from this album, but I don't like it THAT much)That's my review about this album.Keep On Rocking!!!"
2,Too unrocking for my taste but it's alright,"Queen's ""Hot space"" is very different from the classic and excellent albums from the 1970's. The overall approach is more pop than rock. The opening ""Staying power"" is pop-disco with a pumping bass and some horns, and is kind of a declaration of what to expect this time from Queen. Regardless of musical style, Queen are so talented that they do it with class and quality whether it's heavy metal or pop. On this album John Deacon's bass plays a major role on the behalf on Bran May's guitar and even if I would prefer a more guitar oriented album, Freddy Mercury sings as good as always. The melody and the groove is usually there and songs like ""Back chat"" are very good indeed. But of course there's a couple of tunes I don't think stand up to former heights. The closing number ""Under pressure"" is a duet with David Bowie and in regard of the other songs on this album it falls kind of natural."
1,"WHAT IS ""UNDER PRESSURE"" DOING HERE??!!!","QUEEN could have got away with this piece of junk had UNDER PRESSURE not been in this disc. Why? Because when you listen to that song you realize, by simple comparison, how bad all the other tunes are!!!!!! Even the ballads!!! Not to mention the dreadful opening track, STAYING POWER. THis album was an unsincere attempt by QUEEN to go disc and make some more money. Of course fans will say they ""tried a new approach"", ""experimented some new ground""... (...) THis is just a bad CD by a great band. There are hundreds of cases like that !!"
2,QUEEN'S WEAKEST EFFORT,"I really think the rest of the band don't think much of this album. There are only three good songs here: Under Pressure, Las Palabras De Amor and Back Chat. The other songs are forgettable."
1,Keep walking,"Every good artist has an album that should have been taken out and shot.With Queen, it's this one.Olly Buxton"
1,Pretty bad choice of direction for Queen,"What happened in 1980 that made a lot of good bands turn sour? Disco! Queen was a victim of the times and perhaps a horrible identity crisis. While Body Language still pops up on greatest hits packages, that track is not enough to warrant buying this album. Stick with Queen's 70's releases."
3,hot space rocks!,"yes, I said hot space rocks. If you don't like it too bad. The songs are much better when performed live, but these versions are also good."
2,I was disappointed,"I do not know what I expected, however, after seeing this duet on TV, I was disappointed with their recording. Maybe it is just me, but I found nothing memorable here. I was bummed."
3,Kinda Sleepy,"Thievery Corporation's remixes are hit or miss anyway, so I wasn't really sure what to expect. Honestly, while cuts like ""Originality"", ""Revolution Solution"", and ""Shiva"" are nice, the collection as a whole is rather sleepy. I mean I know it's dub music, however c'mon on--even dub should be engaging."
1,missing....,i ordered this dvd for my dad's birthday. he opened it a few days later to watch and found no dvd in the case!
3,"Haven't seen this, but here's some more info:",its a 22 minute TV movie in which Cash plays Johnny Laredo.
3,"nice, but no revelation","after hearing all of the rave reviews of this album i had no choice but to buy it. being a serious mandolin player and vocalist my self, i have a hard time finding anything revoloutionary in this album. though the mandolin playing is great and the original compositions are are very provoking, it is the energy of the band and not staats alone that makes the album a pleasure to listen to. a huge part of the staats mandolin vocabulary seems to rise from the 70's and 80's newgrass revival/sam bush vareity. if one were truly looking for mandolin virtuosity they would look to chris thile, mike marshall, mark o'connor, alaln bibey, and the list goes on. all in all wires and wood is a good album, but the public should not spoil the term virtuosity for those that have truly studied and explored their instrument and brought it to a new level."
5,How do you rate a great CD? Here's my answer:,"If long after you have played the CD, the tune echos in your mind! It true Jonny can pick a mean mandolin -an instrument rarely used in old style bluegrass- but he also shares the spotlight with others in his group. Sam Bush and Jim Hurst can be heard taking a lead, and round out the sound nicely. Listen to ""Catch Me If You Can"" for a good lesson on harmony, and balance. And Jonny Staats drives a UPS truck by day! With music of this caliber, hopefully not for long."
3,Pretty Good Commercial Hardrock,"I've had this disc for a few years now, and just recently listened to it again after a long time. House of Lords was very good musically, and stood out from the others for the type of music that they played. They've always reminded me of bands like Whitesnake, Autograph, and Bonjovi (not to say that they sound the same, just the same vein). Never been a big fan of the vocalist, but he's okay. Greg Giuffria, (I believe the last name is spelled correct) played some nice keyboards on here. The best tunes I think are ""Edge of Your Life,"" ""Jealous Heart,"" ""Love Don't Lie,"" and ""Pleasure Palace."" The intro to ""Love Don't Lie"" is very moving and great. Sahara is a little better than this album. It's a shame that Sahara is out of print."
4,One you may have missed...,"This is one of those albums that you may not have picked up in its first release back in the very late 1980's, and if you didn't, now is your chance. What you have here is a combination of all the parts that made the 80's metal mixture complete: great vocals and lyrics,cutting and melodic guitarwork, and plenty of keyboards to give the music a much deeper feel and complexity than many of those who were charting at the time. It is easy to see why Gene Simmons, the tongue-master himself, saw fit to produce these guys so all of us could have a listen. ""Edge of Your Life"", ""I Just Wanna Be Loved"", and ""Lookin for Strange"" are standout tracks, as is ""Call My Name"", a song which is as good as any of the memorable hits we still crank to 10 a decade later. Seize the opportunity to get this one now that it's been re-issued. Don't miss out on them the second time around."
5,Great Classic Rock,"This is a great cd from a great rock band that came from the greatest era (in my opinion) in rock music. This is a cd that I have listened to almost everyday since I got it. It is that good. Every song on there rocks and if you are a fan of House of Lords or even just a fan of 80's rock, this is a cd for your collection."
4,Super Reader,"In the future California, Spike is not happy that Giles separated him and Drusilla, given Drusilla became a flaming torch, courtesy of Buffy and her extraction team.Confronting Giles, he gets the defenestration treatment, and hence goes to give the Council information. Bad move for him, as they torture information out of him, and Xander dusts him in revenge for the death of Anya.The Council, prepared with this intel, decides to move on Giles and his vampires."
5,A great beginners guide,"As an investing novice I know very little about the financial world before reading this book. Now I understand a great deal, and have a lot more confidence with my money. Through a mixture of wit and wisdom, Tobias entertains while he educates about the wild world of money. This is truly the only investment guide I will ever need."
4,Fierce,"Have been looking for a book that gives the definitions, basics and more importantly the ratings of the various financial instruments available. This is it. I did not give it a full five stars because there were certain definitions that were obscure and some of the stories, while enjoyable, were overly longwinded. But a great all round book nevertheless."
1,poorly done !,"Not sure what the other person was smoking when reviewing this book, but must be a beginner to Dire Straits. This was very poorly done. In many places, the tabs are incorrect. It looks like the transcriber just did what they thought or liked rather than validate it. I would not have bought this book if I had known how wrong it was. I suppose on a plus note it provides an alternate method. Also, the print it too small.Don't buy the book. There are free tabs on the internet that are closer to the way it was played."
1,Ty Beanie Babies Dog,"Don't waste your money on this one. It does not look like the photo. The product is uglier and thinner, and forget trying to comb or fluff the fur. It won't happen."
1,Cheap product,"Made the mistake of buying an after market part made in China, thinking I could save some money. That was a mistake the part arrived on time, the fit was correct, however, the two mounting supports that receive the screws cracked right away when mounted on the truck one breaking off completely. I ended up ordering the Ford part and had no problems."
5,What can you Say.,"Its a tail light, product is compatible to OEM works turns red and white =O).Great product would recommend to others."
5,TYC 11-3189-01 Ford Passenger Side Replacement Tail Light Assembly is as better than the picture,Within two days of purchase I received the TYC 11-3189-01 Ford Passenger Side Replacement Tail Light Assembly for my dad's Ford F250 1999 model. I had accidentally backed into a tree trunk trying to get it out of a ditch this past winter. Took my dad about 20-30 minutes to instal and it looks like new. Fits perfect!.
4,Detecto 339 Balance Beam Scale,"Great price. Happy to have purchased a Made in USA product. Not as 'nice' as the more expensive Health O Meter that I use at the Fitness Center, but I did not have to assemble that one. Seems a little 'cheap' with mating parts not fitting like they should. The scale is best used on a very hard surface. Our carpetted area with a large piece of 5/8 inch plywood underneath was tippy. Cement basement floor is solid with no tipping. I would recommend this scale.Amazon Market Place seller, Center Aisle LLC, fulfilled and shipped the scale quickly. Five Stars for them."
3,Buyer be aware,I had a lot of trouble screwing together the base with the top as the holes did not line up the best since it was a little bent at the bottom. I had a lot of trouble hooking the weight hook to the base-it stuck up in the column and wouldn't come down. I had a lot of trouble zero-ing the unit-it just did not want to stay stable. (there is no dampening so it swings back and forth a lot) There is no mark for the weight pointer to line up to. I had to make my own which did not look as professional as it would if the manufacturer had made the mark. It does work so I would not send it back. It just took much much longer than expected and was harder than expected to put together. It is very very light weight-so be aware the metal is thin.
2,Poor Design,"We bought this together with the Tonka Wheel Driver Scoot n' Scoop 3-in-1 ride-on. With an attachment that comes with the crane, you can turn the ride-on into a tow truck. Good idea but it doesn't work very well. My son can never keep things attached to the hook on the crane. And the crane is virtually useless by itself. Pictures always show the crane standing by itself but it won't stand alone. The child has to hold it up, while trying to operate the crane to pick things up. Its too much to do at one time. My children do play with it time to time, they pretend its a vacuum and push it around the floor."
2,Magnet does not work,"We received this toy as a gift for my 16 month child and found out early on that the magnet is NOT attracted to any metal of any type. So being the tinker that I am, I took the magnet section apart to find that THERE IS NO MAGNET IN THERE! There was just 3 washers (like the metals discs with holes in the middle of them) and they weren't magnetized at all. I tried sticking one of my own magnets in there but I do not have a strong enough magnet. It just didn't work. Unfortunately since I have taken it apart already, I cannot send it back, but maybe I can convince some of you to NOT BUY THIS TOY!"
2,Disappointment,"We thought the Rumblin' Rollin' Crane would be a great addition to the Tonka Scoot'N Scoop, but it has proven to be a big disappointment. Although it is hitched onto the Scoot 'N Scoop, my son continues to play with the truck and ignores the crane."
3,Its ok,"The little one likes it. But insteadof pushing it he carries it around. I myself do not understand the concept of this add on. But nevertheless, it doesn't matter to him the pieces are great."
2,I don't think nephew ever played with it.,I don't remember ever seeing my nephews play with this toy.I'm sure I didn't pay much for it but the excitement for this toy didn't last too long after the initial opening on Christmas eve.
4,Tonka Crane,I bought this for me cousin who is 18 months old and it was a hit at Christmas. This went along with the Tonka dump tuck and attaches at the back and made a great gift for around 20.00 for both. He was very happy. Parents were happy because this can go with him to about 3 years.
1,Not satisfied,I was disappointed in this item the color was faded along all four corners and it did not seem well crafted. I bought this item as a gift but I did not give it away. Now I am stuck with it.
3,color in photo is wrong,Boots show as a light brown but are actually a dark brown color which is better than the color shown in the picture. Very comfortable but with no arch support but space to add an insert. Sides go up to provide very good ankle support. Soft cushioned sole that is great for walking on pavement though they may not wear as long as harder soled shoes. Good chukka for the price and they look great.
1,A complete waste of a good voice ...............,"I don't know quite what to make of this album, or how to determine what part of it is her, what part is people she has known, and what part is people she has seen at a distance. But one thing is certain, it is all filtered through a suppressed anger which transforms the stories in these songs into dirges with very little color or light.Her vocal method of delivery here is a closed-throat, closed-mouth drone that is unnecessary. She has a good voice but won't let it shine because she doesn't trust her lyrics alone to reach the listener and leave their mark. She is the real loser in Bittertown because she hasn't accepted and moved on."
4,"The Buffy episode of ""Angel"" is a keeper, but ""Puppet Show""?","""Angel"" is a very pivotal episode from the first season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer when Buffy discovers her boyfriend is a vampire with a soul, but ""The Puppet Show"" is a below average one, although the tag sequence is a hoot. Why you would want just this tape instead of the entire boxed set is beyond me."
5,Clean wash,Very pleased. My compact washing machine does not accept liquid bleach. I couldn't find powder bleach in the stores. These packets are perfect. I use 1/2 a packet in each white load. Very economical and I have clean white clothes.
2,Less Than Average,"The DVD looks like a pirated 2$ DVD.The picture and sound are good, but the look of the CD and its case is very poor, as if the DVD is a copy with an embalage.It is not worth its actual price. 3$ is more than enough"
4,Scorpions Live,Great video. Thanks Good to see this band in a different setting other than music videos. I'm glad to get this VHS tape.
3,Disappointed,"The product was ordered, but not received until a month later. Yes it fell within the time frame, but it should have arrived sooner. I was just disappointed in how long it took to get here."
4,Great Chain Lube,"Applied the product after cleaning my chain and gears, removing 2 years worth of road grime. The lubricant applied easily and made the chain noticeably quieter while riding. Seems to get the job done and I will continue to use this product."
