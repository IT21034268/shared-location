1,I'd rather throw myself out my 15th floor window,"Ask yourself this - why do you never see any of the ""Top 500 Amazon Reviewers"" reviewing crap like this or any rap for that matter.OK, I'll tell you the answer. Because...it sucks. Nothing but 12 year old white wannabe gangsters listen to this and uneducated people with no jobs that own huge suburbans.I personally don't like ANY rap but I do have respect for Outkast...and let me tell you something, that is where the future of rap music is going.Not this.....garbage (to put it kindly)"
1,not even worth a penny.,"it seems like every day has been ""shorties"" birthday ever since the song ""in da club"" was released. i hate 50 cent. i hate rap music. People these days will like anything that is on the joke now known as MTV. i could go on mtv with a bandana on my head and an apple in my hand and rap about the food chain, and my albums would sell millions of copies. do not by this garbage."
1,Sucks,"He gave the message out that if you want to become popular diss on a well-known artist. That already shows his ignorant talent. Can't you rap about something else than car with rims, drugs, money, and girls? He needs to go buy some education he sounds like a total MORAN when he talks with double, triple, cuadruaple negatives and uses words that are not even in the English dictionary. I grew up listening to rap oh yeah Thank you for making me feel better when I am down and come home and you are rapping about nice cars, clothes, and jewelry that I don't even have. DONT JEOPARIZE YOUR EDUCATION BECAUSE YOU WANT TO IMITATE THIS ILLITERATE RAPPER YOU DON""T HAVE TO GO BROKE TRYING TO HAVE MORE THAN YOUR NEIGHBOOR. Don't support this garbage."
1,Pure genius?... or just more of the same old crap?,"Wow! what an incredible departure from the usual nonsense spewed forth from every ""rapper"" on this planet! even the title blows my mind-""get rich or die tryin'""- that's some pretty deep stuff...anyways, i actually think this is just more of the same old-same old and i wish that these poor fools(""rappers"" in general)would hurry the hell up and DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT, something UNIQUE for god's sake. it's really quite ridiculous and sad how these so called artists keep repeating themselves over and over and over and the masses lap it up like the sheep that they are....WHY?"
4,Doin It Up!,"An album and a story about the streets,crime,women, and everything in between told over some pretty catchy beats'Get Rich or Die Trying' will bring the streets of NY to centerstage with its own spin much like Nas and Az's 1998 chart topping album ""The Firm"" and Mase's 'too hot to handle' debut album ""Harlem World"". Besides obvious cuts like 'in da club' and 'wanksta' this album is known for so called album tracks that just cant be denied.Best Tracks: Blood Hound,Patiently Waiting,Heat, and Don't Push Me."
1,preppy rich kid rap,What the hell are people doing saying hes the next 2pac. I bet if 2 pac was still alive he would have already shot 50cent's head off. This is just some dork that MTV found and said hey lets lie and say u got shot 9 times and then start saying ur like 2pac and that way all these gay little rich kids will say hey this guys gangsta and go buy ur CD. Well i herd this cd and i went out side and smasehed it with a sledge hammer. Peop[le who are real and know what good music is stay far away from this piece of crap.
1,SUCKFEST,"Loud and aggressive, yes;good-HECK NO! This is an effort to cash in on wannabes and little children who wish they were living the ""hard"" life. (Ironic that the kids in the ghetto wish they were living in the suburbs, but anyway...) It all sound the same from In Da Club to P.I.M.P.-an ego stroking, look how hard I am, attempt that falls short. Anyone can push up the bass-not everyone can write inspired lyrics. I like rap-but I give this mess two thumbs down."
2,DRE dropped the ball with this guy,"Dr. Dre ahs done a lot for hip hop over the eyrs, with his classic albums both solo and in NWA,a dn the success of his proteges Snoop and Eminem. This, however, was a very bad call. This guy's rapping ability is almost non-existant, he just mumbles incoherently.The songs aren't his own work, so I guess it's not his fault they're bland motonous and lyricaly immature, merely working off the new image of 'hip-pop' - where the social change, street-level rebellion and push for self-improvement are replaced by the worst of pimpz, gangstaz and gunz cliches.Most of this guy's audience don't realise how cheap and lame it all is. 50 Cent merely gives rap a bad name while being a simple money-makng machine. I almost thing the guy should go back to the dealing, at least he was good at that."
2,This album will be a collector's item,"since I'll be shocked if he lives long enough to make another one. With all the beef around him and the softer version of himself (Ja Rule), that custom-made bullet-proof vest he sports will get much use. In fact, there is more press about his being shot nine times than about the actual music on this record. Sadly, that's more interesting than the record. Drugs, money, sex, guns, and clubbing...ah, the life experiences of a thug. Most of the song content is repetitious and while some of the beats are hot, it's just not enough. Forget about challenging listeners, 50 would probably get more respect this way if he tried to challenge to himself."
3,Well Excuse Me,"Why you all giving this 5 stars... that rating should be reserved for album that will, in the future be classic and desired by people from later generations... this is an average rap album... nothing more nothing less... maybe if he wants to learn how to swear in cool ways though, he should listen to The Darkness, i praise Justin Hawkins for stretching expletives over about 3 seconds at a time... this album gets 3 stars... that's all it deserves really... i doubt it'll stick for long"
2,50 cents? deal,"With so much quality music coming from NY its hard to understand, how 50 has become such a superstar when surounded by quality musicians in the rap game. I do admit that the majority of beats are beutifully produced (Dre/Eminem), but if you want to here some lyrical substance within this kinda music, look no further than fellow new yorkers Necro and Ill Bills recent mixtape CD. While, there are ear pleasers such as In the club and PIMP, the product provokes a non-existant challenge for the listener, and while the comparison may sound a little harsh, 50's deliverance within both the way he mumbles and the overall structure of his rhymes are reminicent of past puff daddy protege, Mase. Still, if you like your production mill rap music, produced for the mass, then youll probably like this.Unfortunatley though, this is just another hiphop offering for the poor man to buy and the rich record exec to sell, to make a lot more than 50 CENTS."
1,Only if you can put 0 stars,This is one of the worst CD's ever! I dont have the CD but i heard it at my friends house who LOVES him and I ask why? Why does everyone think 50 cent is so good. He can't even rap. Eminem probobaly does all the work for him
1,I do not get the hype,"This album is not real ""hip-hop"" by no means. I can see why the airwaves if full of junk and hip hop is so polluted with fakers, and wannabes. I really do not care about if you got shot or sold drugs. Be real, be true, and come hard with the music. We need to get back to GangStarr, Outkast, Tribe, and real artists. This is a studio gangster effort and it shows. I was not impressed by this album at all."
1,U call this Hip-Hop,"Rap has dropped to another low. I'm from Australia and i havn't heard this 'so-called' rap played on the radio/television so much. Every second commercial promoting this albulm. This albulm has become Brittney Spears not rap. Whoever says this albulm is phat are not true fans but pop lovers. 50 cent mumbles rather than raps. He claims he's keeping it real, however this as commercial a rapper can get. Let the every day public adore this Bull**** real hip-hop fans buy Killan Priest - Black August instead."
1,Why?,"50 cent is the biggest joke in the rap business these days. I could rap too if I made up my own words, and ""would you hug me if I smelled?"", or ""You're a wanksta betchu aint even got none"" are just a couple of examples of his horrible rhyme making,AND THOSE ARE HIS SINGLES!!! I thought Eminem was bad when he came out, but at least he can rhyme without making up words. Please, for the love of god, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ALBUM!!!!!"
1,WTF!,"aiight ok 50 got shot nine times!!!! wtf i think he got shot in the vocal chord like geez. This garbage is horrible. What did he do to rap music!?! Ha ha im straight country cuz of this mofo. Don't buy this cd save your money this guy needs serious help! Of course i was readin the reviews and most of em make a good point. 50 got rich, he did stop trying! Your prolly one of those retards who'll buy it no matter what just to support a guy out there who got shot 9 times. Man he has it pretty bad... The amount of times he got shot at he has an equal # of cars, houses and million dollar bills. These rap artists are retards, they sit around talkin about how bad their life is... I DONT HAVE 9 CARS!?! He get a clue 50 you got it good... you guys never stop to think about us guys in the hood... we got it hard... i dont anymore though i admit it! get a clue retard!"
4,Great album...,"50 Cent did great on this album. Em and DRE also did well on producing.I don't know why people are saying he can't rap,he has the hottest flow lately.The best tracks are patiently waiting, many men,high all the time,heat,if i cant,back down,21 questions,gotta make it to heaven,and u not like me.I hope fiddy will be more consistent the next time he releases his next album..."
1,If they had a Special Olympics for Hip Hop...,"This would win the Gold. I cannot understand for the life of me how this cd made so many ""best of"" lists last year. This dude's flow makes him sound mildly retarded this is worse than Chingy. I've been a fan of Hip Hop for going on 2 decades now and I realize that everybody complains about the sorry state the music is in, I don't think that's true. Mainstream Rap music might be at an all time low as far as creativity and talent, but the underground is flourishing. Avoid garbage like 50 Cent at all costs, check out artists with something to say like Blackalicious, Jurassic 5, Madlib, El-P, hell even Outkast. This is exploitative trash and 50 Cent must have gotten some serious brain damage on one of those occasions when he was shot. If you really like your rappers with plenty of bullet scars go buy an ODB cd."
1,Yu Wont not Feind Me In thet clube.,"I reely thank this is just badily, I won't lake it becaz it is joust a bunch of dude singan about in clubbing and other stuff that blackies. I do not lake to here aboot this crape, he iz onely a musicer becaz he got shoot 9 tames. This CD doesn't like to. I don't. I thank this cd isn't soundful bat mast CDs now days a. arent. not. I doo nat lake this at, all. thes guy isn't gad he canot sang. he cannto. maybe I joust don't like dark tone skin. or naybe mot. Who cares. Do not buy, I recceomend you to buy this, not. Not to reccomend it is to buy me. Please do nat buy or reckomend it. Dont. Do not.No Love! Dont'!"
1,MZ Ann,How old are you 7? 50 Cent's album is full of crap fads. On every track you know Eminem is ghostwriting and the only good parts are the hot sounds created by Dr. Dre. He and Ja are so fixated on each other its sickening. If you want to find a good NY rapper check out The Notorious B.I.G.
5,The next big thing.,"50 cent has been coming on strong in the past year. If you have not herd of 50, or his G-Unit crew then maybe you herd of Emenem and Dr. Dre. Shady and Aftermath Records have signed 50 and helped to produce it. Dre and Em's influences are all in the album. Bringing a strait street style to every track. Every song is good, no skip overs. his lyrics are direct and his hooks are smooth. This is an instant classic, 50 cent is the next big thing."
3,OK,"this album is OK, not a classic by far. But I recomend never buying a 50 album. And ill bet anyone 5 bucks that 50's record sells are just gunna get worse every album he puts out because he never artisticly grows. He is obsessed with guns and killing. Sometimes I would like to hear a little more than that."
1,quit 50,"this album is wannabe gangsta rap garbage. i don't understand why people say 50 cent brought back gangsta rap, the only he brought back was crap. this album isn't even worth 50 cents. the only thing good about this album is eminems verses. don't buy this album, it's absolutely the worst album of 2003."
4,Tight CD!,The CD IS TIGHT! I am asking all of you out there to avoid haterz like Optimus Prime who is probably a huge Ja Rule and Young MC fanatic! The CD has a lot of tight beats on it and the flow is cool. Now if you have never liked 50 then this album wont make you a disciple but hey no sibgle album converted anybody to anything. gIVE PROPS AND MOVE ON BUT DONT HATE. Hating on another man is an effeminate quality that you need to suppress by giving an abjective opinion.
3,dump it,"Overall the album is mediocre at best. There are about 4 tracks that are bangin, and the monotone lyrics don't help either. I would not reccomend this CD to anyone, but that's just me. The radio plays it enough anyway."
3,So far,So far this it the only rapper worth listening to thats out right now. Too bad we would never have rapper that could rap like Pac & BIG.
5,"If you like radio songs, this ain't for you","This album is pure heat. Of course if you like Ja or anything like that radio mess you ain't gonna like it. That seems to be the case with all those out there sayin it's average at best. Y'all need to put the LL Cool J album down and look for your inner thug. 50 wasn't tryin to make stuff for you to listen to on you 6x9's as you cruise around in your Chevy Malibu, this album is for the thugs rollin' through the hood in the Caprice with the tinted windows on dubs. So if that ain't you, stay off here dissin' a album that's pure gold. With tracks like 4,6,10, and 18, this album tells bout the life in the hood. So suburbians with white picket fences and flamingoes in the yard beware. Eminem, Dre, Nate Dogg all on one album with 50.....it don't get better than that."
5,HARDEST RAPPER SPITTING,"MARK MY WORDS! 50 CENT WILL BE A STAR! HIS INDEPENDENT CD'S WERE THE HOTTEST AND NOW HIS MAINSTREAM DEBUT WILL BLOW THE ROOF OFF! THE GUY JUST KNOWS HOW TO PUT A SONG TOGETHER. SO DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GET 5O CENT IS THE FUTURE, NO MERCY NO FEAR, GUESS WHO'S BACK, AND MOST CERTIANLY COP THAT LATEST ONE GET RICH OR DIE TRYING. I'M OUT!!!"
1,Curtis Jackson Doesn't Care About Talent,"This Album Belongs In The Trash Can!!!!!!!! He Used To Have Skills Before He Got Shot. Power of The Dollar Was A Great Album!!!!! It's Waaaaaaaay Better Than ANYTHING G-Unit Or 50 Will Put Out In The Near Future. 50 Dissed Ja For Singing...When He Does The Same Exact Thing!!!..He Raps About Being Gangsta...When He Releases Candy Shop!!!!!!!! He Just Keeps On Dissing Everyone Who Does A Song With HIS Enemy...He Dissed Fat Joe And Jadakiss Just For Doing A Song With Ja Rule!!! And How Can 50 Talk About Running New York? Last Time I Checked, Wu-Tang Ran New York!! I Can't Wait Till 50 & G-Unit Are Out of The Industry Forever...They've Ruined Rap!!! It's Official!!!!! It's True! And I Heard Puffy Has A Posthumous Biggie Album Comin' Out Soon...And If Eminem Produces It And G-Unit Is On It Making Biggie Say 'G-G-G-G-Unit!', Puffy Needs A Home...And That Home Is....The Mental Hospital!!!!!!!!!!!!!!DON'T SUPPORT G-UNIT!!!!!!!"
4,its ok...,track 1 is the intro...track 2 - what up gangsta?- 8/10track 3- patiently waiting (feat eminem)-10/10track 4- many men ( wish death) - 9/10track 5 - In Da Club - 7/10track 6 - high all the time - 7.5/10track 7 - Heat - 7/10track 8 - If I Can't - 8/10track 9 - Blood Hound (feat young buck) - 7/10track 10 - Back Down - 8/10track 11 - P.I.M.P. - 7/10track 12 - Like My Style (feat tony yayo) - 2/10track 13 - Poor Lil Rich - 6/10track 14 - 21 Questions(feat nate dogg) - 8/10track 15 - Don't Push Me (feat eminem and Lloyd banks)10/10track 16 - gotta make it to heaven - 9/10
4,Good Album!!!,"This Album was severly overrated, but it still aight!50 cent may seem Gangsta to sum, Wanksta to others; but tha truth is he got some skills, too bad he a snitch, and tries to be too Gangsta! If he just stayed him self he might get mo' respect - stop hatin' on Jarule - cause he got sum mad skills you could neva have!!!If Jarule was on AFterMath he would sell just as many records as 50 and Eminem - due to Dre's beats!!!Tha 'in da club' beat is a classic!!!Dont judge by tha image, judge tha music!PEACE"
5,Best CD of 2003,"Are you people insane?! How can you say that this CD only has 2 good songs on it. I personally give this CD 5 stars. 50 Cent is not getting the attention he deserves. How was he not even nominated for Album of the Year at the Grammy's? And how did Outkast beat him in ""Best Rap Album"". This album is, by far, one of the best the rap industry has ever seen. I'm looking very forward to the end of 2004, when 50, eminem, and Dre will all be relasing their new albums. Shady Records is the best label by FAR!!!"
3,Let's Get Something Straight,"I have already reviewed this album, so I won't do it again. I have heard too many ""50 is the best rapper ever comments."" Now if the argument was about Rakim, Nas, Jay-Z, Chuck D, etc., then that's a statement with merits to back it. But 50, come on you all. So I just want to know what makes an MC (especially 50 Cent) so great. Is it lyrical substance or being gansta? Is it versatility, rhyme patterns, and flow or is it being shot, talking about cars, and pimping hoes? This review isn't to necessarily knock anybody, but I really would like to know the types of MCs you all believe are so great.Can you believe I had someone tell me that Juvenile was a better skilled MC than Common Sense? Needless to say I question his intelligence."
5,50 You Hot!!!,"The only word for this Cd is DAMN! I mean i bought the cd and from the beginning to the end it's nothing but straight up tight music. You can get down to every song on the CD. There ain't no song on there that's not tight. From the wild combinations or lyrics to the tight ... beats this CD will go over Triple Platinum. I hope, matter of fact you...better get this damn CD..."
4,50 cent,"overall pretty tight for a debut album, just what you would expect from 50 cent. Some standout tracks are In Da Club, Heat, Patiently Waiting, back Down, and Poor lil rich.a lot of singin outta 50 and its tite. buy this 4sho if u like dre production, some tight ... beats(Heat, poor lil rich, in da club) dre and em are the best producers on it, but only a couple are produced by eminem(dont push me, patiently waiting) a few by dre. overall 8\10."
1,Worth 0 cents.,"This cd is not even worth 50 cents because its just like every other trendy and commercial garbage out today.The beats are too simple and the lyrics are full of the same old gangster nonsense.This guy is so over rated and talentless that I cant even begin to descibe.Many of the mindless mtv sheep will be buying this,but if your original and like good music you will skip this trash.DO NOT BUY THIS CD."
1,50 get out of the club,For starters what the hell is a guy who cant sing cant dance cant write music in this buisinuses. now i know hw might have a cool voice for talking but he cant sing whith it. so do us a favor a dont give mony to a untalinted thug.
1,doesnt deserve a penny,"Owns a multi million dollar album and doesnt deserve a penny.Rate it in negative stars if possible.Pointless lyrics, crummy vocals , no instrumental talent = no talent at all. If you want to see talent look into some hard rock or heavy metal. Awesome lyrics, alot of good vocals, and insane instrumental talent."
1,Terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I'm sick of the crap being played on the radio instead of great bands like Killswitch Engage, In flames, As I Lay Dying, Lamb of god, Ect. Now thats real music. Not this crap. The only reason this guys even popular is because he got shot nine times. In a few years rap will die just like disco. Then metal will rule the world once again."
5,u hating mothasuckas make me laugh,"50 cent album, is tha best album to hit stores in a wile, no one will ever be better than pac. this album has good beats, which im sorry to say, but 50 cannot get credit for that, cuz dre and another producer made those tracks. the c.d. is not a let down at all, every track on it is good, and he puts a little twist of being a playa with ""21 questions"" comon dawg thats one for the biyatches, i dont think u will ever hear 50 sing with a biyatch, and when he does then u can start talking about him being commercial and .... to whoever thinks ja is better than 50, u shouldnt even be writing a review here, u should be in the britney spear section cuz u obviously like pop music, dam little girls. go out and cop the album man, dont expect lyrics like 2pac though, cuz 50 just has a nice flow. stop hating on tha man, little girls."
3,50 Cent in nickles,"I give much love 2 50 4 getting up there. To really honest, he should have put out of his out albums. This one came up short to me. He had some good tracks on here. But it's not as good as I first intended. If Em never signed him to Shady Aftermath, this would be another 50 Cent bootleg Cd. So, I say get the CD if you wanna fellow everyone who think it's cool to get a 50 Cent cd."
4,A Rap Classic!,"There are very few weak songs on this disc. Will probably go down as one of rap's greatest CD's. ""In Da Club"" rocks, as well as ""Patiently Waiting w/ special guest Eminem"", and ""Many Men"" is another great track. Dr Dre's hands are all over this record, and you can hear it in the mix. Dre is the new God Of Rap. 50 Cent is the newest thing if you love Gangster Rap like I do. Get your nine out, and crank it up!"
5,ALL ABOUT 50 CENT,I LOVED HIS CD! The reason why is bcoz he is keepin it real by tellin me about himself in his lyrics. Its real life in his lyrics and what life is like out there now n for life.50 CENT is so LARGE N HEAVY.50 CENT IS KEEPIN IT REAL 4 LIFE HE SO GANGSTA!...
5,u gotta listen to every song~~!!!,"I luuuuuved this album because it wasnt just one of those cd's that u buy that has like ONE good song on it but they are ALL really good songs! Its like the type of cds that u buy and u memorize all the songs. Its not just like hard core rapping with screaming and nothing but cursing that makes no sense whatsoever, but it has beat to it. Every song is independent and has a different one. If you are looking for a good rap album to get 50's is definetly THE ONE."
3,Needs eminem,50 cent is a good rapper. but if he never signed wit eminem. people would be like 50 who?...It is the truth if 50 signed wit that other lable he would not be as big as he is wit eminem.so in order for 50 to be big he needed eminem.. if 50 never had eminem he would be nothin... so gotta give big up to eminem
1,I don't know whos the idiot? 50 cent or the customer?,"I'd rather donate my money to a corrupt charity[...].Reasons why 50 cent is the best!!!1. I can relate to his lyrics ""in da club"" and ""pimp""2. Hes on the radio and mtv all day!!! (which means hes talented)3. He has talent!! because he doesnt play any instruments."
1,pure garbage,"Stay away from this crap, you are wasting your money. this is NOT rap. i cant believe what rap has turned into these days. this album is pure bubble gum rap. 50 cent is an absolute joke dont support him by buying this album"
2,Don't be fooled. This is not real rap.,"50 Cent has to be one of the most overrated artists to come around in the past 10 years. It seems that both media hip-pop fans and underground hip-hop fans love this guy. I just can't understand why. First off, let me list off some reasons why I feel he sucks:-He has no flow-He shows absolutely no emotion. He has the same boring, monotone vocals in each song.-He's another rapper who tries to get by on good beats, rather than lyrical talent.-On the song, ""Patiently Waiting"", Eminem embarasses the man on his own track. You can obviously tell who the better lyricist is here.-All he talks about is how he's going to kill people.-He has an annoying slur.The only good songs on ""Get Rich Or Die Tryin'"" are ""Patiently Waiting"" (which is good only because of Eminem), ""21 Questions"" (Nate Dogg saves this one from sucking), and ""Life's On The Line"" (A hidden track which was made before he got shot and gained that annoying slur)."
1,A waste of time and money,"Just when the rap game was getting too redundant and cliche, 50 Cent comes out.This album has all the production to be a classic, but there is no originality to the lyrics and style. Rap music needs a savior if this is it's future."
4,huh??,"the album is definitely hot... after listening to the whole thing it actually sounds more profane than his underground stuff which is surprising. and i got a question for everybody: what the heck is up with Carson Daly taking on an ebonics thing when he talks to a rapper? anyone notice this? he talks normally when some 'other' person is on his show, but when dudes like Busta Rhymes or 50 Cent come on all of a sudden he starts talking with an accent. whatever. this album is hot (Many Men and In Da Club are the hottest tracks)"
5,Finally!!!,"All fans of true hip-hop/gangsta rap have been waiting about five years for somebody to come along and knock the rap world on it's %$#. The wait is over. 50 cent has come along and will finally take rap back to a level where it was in the early & mid 90's. This is the most exciting moment for a hip-hop fan since the release of Makavelli's last album(while he was still alive). I've only heard about half of the cd, but this is truly, truly a masterpiece. Eminem is probably the most talented lyrical tactician out right now, but(sadly, because of the color of his skin) he will never be able to get truly gritty on the mic. People, if you're even a little bit interested in rap, invest in this album, you will not be sorry you did. Plus he busts on them ""wankstas"" for murda, inc., and that should be enough to make you want to own this cd."
1,Garbage,"Now we moved past weak voices to mumbing ones? This fool should have been dismissed a long time ago, but it is amazing what this MTV society will buy into these days."
1,who's birthday is it?,"in my country if you make music this bad you get your privates chopped off. thats all i have to say, no 50 cent, it isn't my birthday, and we're not gonna party like its my birthday, especially not to your crappy music.have a nice day"
1,50 sucks,"50 Cent is a terrible rapper. He has no talent. Being shot 9 times is no excuse for sucking this bad. He mumbles about who knows what but we can assume that hes saying how much money he has and using the ""n"" word every 5 seconds. Do yourself a favor: save your money for real music. If you're going to listen to rap listen to Atmosphere."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I got this CD b/c of the songs I'd heard on the radio, of course, but later found that I can listen to most of this CD without pressing the FF button. Of these other songs, I like ""Many Men"" probably the best b/c it seems to get stuck in my head throughout the day. I would definitely recommend this album."
4,50 cent at his best,50 cent at his best.you can not beat having dr dre and eminem on the production.there was so much hype around 50 cent and this album backed it up.with each album 50's sale dropped and so did the creative spark.his most recent online freestyles have him rapping with the hunger that this album carried.so if you want 50 at his finest then buy this album.
3,THE ONLY GOOD 50 ALBUM THATS IT,"THIS ALBUM REPRESENTS THE STREETS, THE STRUGGLE, BUT ALL OTHER 50 CENT ALBUMS ARE GARBAGE.THIS ALBUM IS STRAIGHT FROM THE HEART SONGS LIKE MANY MEN TO BLOOD HOUND.EVEN THOUGHT I DON'T LISTEN TO 50 CENT ANY MORE THIS IS HIS ONLY ALBUM WAS GOOD.REAL SONGS- BLOOD HOUND FEAT. YOUNG BUCK- PATIENTLY WAITING- MANY MENI'D RATHER LISTEN TO DMX,JAHAD OR 2PAC.50 CENT SUCKS NOW AND YOU KNOW IT,I USED TO BE A FAN..THE HYPE IS FAKE ON INTERSCOPE RECORDS ONLY 2PAC WAS REAL."
5,Great music is a must,This was a great album by 50. His lyrics touch me on so many different levels. It kind of reminds me of the new album Sparkplug by Bmoc and DJ Shan. It's all great stuff.
3,Pretty good,I know this album was the one who made 50 fifty!And some of the tunes are real good but after the hype has gone and you liste to it again you'll notice that this is really NOT that good album at all. Not Bad! But not the great one and specially that to be compared to pac...*They like me I want em to love me like they lov Pac....*sorry mate...
3,great cd but....,50's debut cd with interscope records is excellent...his flows are tight.....and he has club-banging beats..but some of the songs wear on you and you get tierd of listening to them....50 is a amazing rapper but maybe next time he will make his next one better....
3,IT WASN'T ALL THAT!!!,I STILL DON'T SEE WHAT ALL THE HYPE WAS ABOUT!!!NOW DON'T GET ME WRONG 50 MY BOY AND ALL BUT UMMM THIS ALBUM WASN'T ALL THAT TO ME!!!INFACT I DON'T REALLY EVEN LISTEN TO IT THAT MUCH!!!BUT HEY HE DOIN HIS THING AND I CAN'T HATE ON THAT FOREAL YO!!!
5,finally a rap cd worth buying,"okay this cd is worth the cashflow but it's nowhere near on the same pages as the chronic, straight outta compton, or enter the wu still a good cd and 50's rhymes are tight and yes he disses ja fool on here and those 2 have some serious beef."
4,50 Cent Came Close...,"50 cent came close to a 5/5 but I think the media is way too hyped about this product. Its not the best but its not the worst. If you like beats to get you groovin' or whatever this is the CD for you. However, I didn't like the language but its still better then Eminems.Overall: great album if your into rap. Buy it."
1,"Fifty Cent's ""Get Rich or Die Tryin""","This album is crap. There was only one good song on the whole album. Don't waste your money on this album like I did. Just buy the single of ""P.I.M.P."""
1,Blah Blah Blah,"The 2004 Grammy's voters proved what I have always thought....50 Cents is not talented!! For the first time (in a long time), the Grammy voters did the right by not giving an imposter an award. This cd sold hot, but it is not respected. 50 Cents even lost ""Best New Artist"" and had the nerve to get on stage to ""protest"". He only made himself look bad because no one saw his point (even his fellow rappers thought it was in bad taste). The worst offense to rap music this year is 50 Cents's ""Get Rich Or Die Tryin"" which is painfully dated. Gangsta rap died when 2Pac and Biggie died. Plus, this cd is not even ""gangsta"". Its corporate mindless rap, meant only to make money. I hope 50 realizes that his time is almost up."
3,It was an alright album,"50 comes out hard with a tight first release from the album ""In The Club"". But one thing that made me mad about the song is that the video had nothing to do with the song. But beyond that fact, 50 laid down a tight couple of tracks. My personal favs are ""Patiently Waiting"", ""High All The Time"", ""Don't Push Me"", and ""back down"". 50 cent came out of now where to claim his spot in the rap game. I do give him his props, but overall the cd could of been better. Lyricism was alright, some beats were hot...but thats all you can say about this album. As for being a 5 star cd, it falls short."
1,Zero stars if possible,"wow all i have to say is 50 Cent has the whackest lyrics i've ever heard he talks about the same goddamn thing all the time the only reason i was even aware that fifty brought his retarted ass outta the ghetto was that Dr. Dre was working with him, and i thought to myself Dres beats an some new guy may b this will b good was i right? absolutley not if anything i'd smack dre for signing this idiot. All thats come out of fifty cents music is stupid white kids fromt the suburbs thinking their gangsters an thugs which they aren't. So fifty shut up and stop makin music ure killing the already dieing rap industry."
3,"CD Lacks Addictiveness, Creativity","With so many Dre tracks floating around in Hip Hop these days, it's hard to say how the good ones were avoided on this album. There are some great songs on this album (Patiently Waiting, Wanksta, In Da Club), but so many more awful ones (Don't Push Me, 21 Questions, Many Men, Bloodhound, You Not Like Me, etc.) The CD would be good to blast in your car if you're a rich white boy who's convinced himself that he's black. Which you're not. I'm sorry.Highlights: Patiently Waiting, In Da Club, WankstaLowlights: Many Men, If I Can't, P.I.M.P, Like My Style, Poor Lil Rich"
3,Too clean for 50...,"The songs are great except ""Lifes' on tha line"" where somebody else does the rapping instead of 50 (unless he just sounds that different). All the songs are great. The intro[s] are good. Only problem with this version is it is TOO clean. I mean, why should words like;gun,shot,blood,pop,and murder be edited? I would reccommend the derrty version, but he uses super strong language and unless u bought this so ur mom would think u had clean rap, then it's (the derrty version) is just too explicit."
2,mediocre lyrics,"I really like Dr. Dre's production on ""In Da Club"" and ""What Up Gangsta"". It's very widescreen and explosive. Dre really knows how to craft beats around the persona of the artist he is working with; whereas on Em's albums he creates beats that belong in some strange cartoon funk world, here he makes cinematic blockbuster beats, like a gangstered up Jerry Bruckheimer film. 50's lyrics, however, are just lists of cliches. I remember Guru from Gangstarr rapping that ""too many rappers wanna be gangstas, too many gangstas wanna be rappers."" This is what he was talking about. Give me talent over street cred any day..on top of that, dude looks like some kinda corny pop'n'lock action figure. In a few years he'll be singing duets with J.Lo, just wait..."
3,ALPHA-BETA-GAMMA rating (50 Cent),This album is good but 50 cent is just over-rated.If he was ugly would he still sell records?This is a good album though.Not good enough to be 4 or 5 stars
1,"NO DIRTY LYRICS???? Awesum album, however","I love 50 cent and i love this cd, however, i think it was kind of dumb to make a version of the album which has no curse words on it. i didn't see the point of that. i own the dirty version and it's a million times greater. i give the dirty version five stars, but i only give the Clean version one star out of five. the dirty version is the greatess rap album evr. that and 'jackpot' by chingy. for real good metal albums, buy limpbizkit 'Chocolate Starfish and the hotdog flavored water' and or linkin park 'meteora'."
5,BeSt RaPpeR eVa!!!!!,"50 Cent Iz my favorite rapper eva. He's got awesome Flow and his beatz and lyrixxx are the best. My Fav songz on dis Cd are ""in da club"" and ""21 questions"". I llisten to this CD almost evry day and there are no bad songs on this so if u don't own it, get it now. i also recommend getting chingy 'jackpot' if you don't have it yet, for real rap. if you want real metal, get linkin park 'meteora', limpbizkit 'chocolate starfish and the hot tog falvored water' or better yet, get them all!!!!11!!!"
1,I'm ashamed to listen OR look at him...,"I though Mase was bad... I'm actually beginning to like him now since 50 cent came out. And, does he actually think he looks touch staring with that ""hard"" expression on his face? No! He looks constipated. Then, he smiles... he looks like a baby crapping its diaper. He has no talent, he has only one tone to his voice and he raps so softly, you can barely understand him. I mean, he could be rapping ""Do not pass go Don't collect $200"" and no one wouldn't notice. In a couple of years, he's gonna fade out, like most no-talent wannabes."
1,I Wouldn't pay 50 cents for this,"Oh my God this is filled with complete garbage. Just a bunch of pop culture phrases and made up nonsense words in rhyme, whenever two quarters here talks about guns it just makes you think about committing suicide. It is really sad when this album makes mc hammer, vanilla ice, marky mark, millie vanillie, and even N sync look like gods.If you listen to it you may lose so many IQ points that you make Jessica Simpson and Paris Hilton look smart!"
1,50 Cent- more mysoginistic hip-hop garbage,"50 Cent's debut album ""Get Rich or Die Tryin"" brings nothing new to hip-hop thats hasnt already been used over and over again. This album drops some scarce beats throughout, but 50 Cent's errant attempts at laying anything down lyrically fail miserably through an album that wholly lacks substance, innovation, and cleverness. 50 Cent's recent popularity is a sad testament as to what can pass as hip-hop in an industry that regards true talent as an afterthought. Essentually, ""Get Rich or Die Tryin"" is another lame CD on a long list of recent pop-rap that plays off all the same cliches in mainstream hip-hop that have generally fueled its demise. If you want to listen to hip-hop that truely displays substance and character, listen to Blackstar, Mos Def, Common, Talib Kweli, Jurassic 5, and anything by the Roots."
1,"Yo, sling me one of those . . .","Was at my boy's crib, enjoy'n some herb, and some wanker drops in this cd. Boom, that was it, party over.This cd has got to be the monster truck of all hip-hop ball washers.Is it me, or does anybody understand what this dude is even say'n? He's bumbl'n, stumbl'n practically fall'n over himself just to get the rhymes out.This is just another cat gett'n his 50, oppps, I mean, 15 minutes . . . until the same time next year. We'll all be at Mc D's tell'n dude behind the counter to sling us a mac, then we'll be like, wait a min', aren't you that rapper, what's his name?Mykey"
1,Another knucklehead who can't speak English,"Take one inarticulate, mumbling, nearly unintelligible, mentally dim criminal sociopath who personifies every vice that has turned inner city black neighborhoods into the equivalent of third world countries; add some pro music software tools and loops that do not require any musical knowledge; unleash it on the ""community"" without any regard for morals but only greed (hey, get the title), and you have this album. The companies that produce this sewage are evil parasites that have caused more damage to the black community than hundreds of years of slavery ever did. Hey, 50 cent, you talk as if you are too stupid and too immoral to handle money or success. I hope it becomes your undoing. You and your handlers make Mike Tyson look like a nobel laureate."
1,50-cent sucks,i don't know where all these idiots get the idea this is good music because its not. It is just plain bad. when i listen to this loser's music i can't tell a difference between this and any other rappers music. the only difference i can tell between him and anybody else is hes been shot more times. If rap gets too popular were gonna have a very very dismal digusting sad future. If you ask me green day or U2 are much better. I'm like good raps but this is just terrible. only a stupid dumb dull brainless half-minded idiot would by this @#$%. If I could I'd rate negative stars because its terrible. I could every word under bad in the theasaurus and that still wouldn't describe how bad it is. Say this rating wasn't helpful if you like but ITS JUST PLAIN BAD MUSIC and its undeniable.
1,only gave it one star cause i have to.....,"ok, this cd is horrid. 50 cent is the pinnacle of why people hate rap. he has no talent whatsoever. this guy may have been shot 9 times or whatever but big deal, this guy is horrible. u wanna hear some real hardcore hip hop, listen to jedi mind tricks, vinnie paz would rip 50 to shreds. he doesnt live a gangster life style. all he is doing is making money off of america to buy his hummer and whatever. challenge urself and listen to some hip hop with actual content such as: jedi mind tricks, atmosphere, living legends, aesop rock, eyedea and abilities, the oddjobs. and if u must listen to the hardcore rap: brotha lynch hungg, x raided, sicx, or doomsday productions. dont listen to this sellout"
2,"Like Public Enemy said, Don't Believe The Hype!","Honestly, I like 50 Cent as a rapper; he has a certain honesty to him that is lacking in most rappers today. When I heard that he was signing with Dr. Dre and Eminem, I was happy for him; it was certainly the best career choice he ever made, since this has sold 4 million plus albums. But one provision though, the only reason he is in mainstream culture is beause he is associated with Eminem, which will guarantee platinum status(think D12). As far as the music goes' it gets stale and repetetive after awhile. Wanksta is a great song; not for the lyrics, but for his approach towards the fakes and phonies of the rap world. But I love 50 anyway, and God bless him in future projects."
3,"Solid debut, not mind blowing","Early in 2003, 50 cent realesed one of the most anticipated albums in the history of Hip-Hop ""Get Rich or Die Tryin"". I bumped this album for about 3 straight months before taking it out of the CD changer. Over the summer, marked with a new appreciation for rap,I listened to this album, only to be disapointed. Though the album has very good beats, 50's rhymes are not great, (though I do think he is getting better after hearing some recent guest appearences) the best verses on this album are owned by Eminem on ""Patiently Waiting"" and ""Don't Push Me"". Along with Eminem's guest appearences, the best songs on the album are ""In Da Club"" (one of the best hip-hop party jams ever, yea ever), and ""Heat"", which has a nice beat delievered by one of the best Dr. Dre. Lyrically overall this album is not great, but riding on it's beats, it earns a 3/3.5 rating. Hopefully 50's follow up will be better."
5,buy this cd 50 cent is on his way to the top.,"I love this cd, it doesnt leave my cd player very much.(only to put anything from jay-z in it) . Each one of his songs has something different that you will like about it . I wouldnt play it around your parents or young kids because of the lyrics.50 is going to be bigger than eminem very soon ...trust me this man is gonna be around a long time. check out the cd you will not be sorry"
1,Great CD...,...if you are in need of the following:1. A coaster2. An unscented urinal cake3. A hockey puck4. A shooting target5. A lobotomy
5,50 Cent Is Bulletproof,"i had previously heard Get Rich Or Die Tryin thanks to bootleggin and i was very pleased and it was everything i expected.the production on this album is crazy wit eminem and dre on the boards. with all the talent shady/aftermath has now and if they sign mobb deep then the game will bow down. every track on this cd is bumpable and aint no skippin songs goin on here. this is one of the most well rounded new artists,rap artist period i have heard in a minute. yall cant touch 50 no more and no more shootin at my boy. forget the source them and benzino should shut their mouths. watch out for XXL and shady in the next year."
4,Can't go wrong,"With Emenim and Dre producing this album I anticipated some great beats which it has. The first couple tracks do get off to a slow start. Seems like other reviews I have read say 50 cent is one rapper who has something to say. Seems to me all he talks about over and over is the same thing on every rapper does. Just hos, guns, drugs and having beef with some other rapper. He does pull off some good lines and I like his flow but I wouldn't call him a prophet. He's just getting down to some good beats. I give this album 4 of 5 stars based on the fact that I like Em and Dre and I think they did well producing this album. It's one I can listen to all the way through and enjoy it for the most part."
1,How can you listen to an image?,"I almost feel sorry for the people who think 50 Cent is the best thing to happen in hip-hop since the turntable. For one, he lacks flow and rhyming ingenuity. He isn't saying anything I ain't heard before. The only thing he has going for him is his image and a wealth of fans who love him for his image. If you like it, go ahead and listen to it, but if you really think that he can spit, go out and buy yourself some Hieroglyphics and give yourself a crash-course in lyricism. Trust me."
2,"""Power of a dollar"" kicked ass than this...","To me 50 cent's very first album ""Power of a Dollar"" was more Hip Hop at its purest than ""GRODT"". It was more fire on that album though it was unreleased. To this day that album is leaked on the internet! I rather listen to that 50 in '99, he was more hungry and more focused in his music. I dont understand why everyone doesn't look up to that album! It has songs you'll definitely like."
4,Get Rich or Die Tryin',"This is a pretty good album. I really like the beats and rhymes in it. Go buy this cd, its awesome."
2,Not all he's being hype up to be.,"Let me get this out of the way, ""In da club"" is one of the best club songs of all time.Whew! Now,this album is filled with such crap it makes me sick. The only other good tracks are ""Many men"", ""Backdown"", and ""Wangsta"". The rest of the tracks are just repeated attemps to get a single. Real ""thugs"" don't name drop, brag or boast about the things they needed to do to survive. 50 is the platinum plus performance thug he so desperatley tries to critisize. Burn it, copy it from a friend or just turn on the radio; but do yourself a favor and don't waste your money."
1,horrible,"i don't understand how this cd could be so succesful? the man doesn't display talent. the effort seems pointless, who would waste their stinkin time to produce an album rapped by a man who just talks fast. i don't understand music these days. this is just another example a failure. justin timberlake will be in the same case too cuz his album is so corny and just not worth buying. don't purchase this cd! even if you are into this music, purchase O.D.B or P diddy."
1,OVERRated!!!!!!!,"I think 50cent's 1st LP ""Get Rich or Die Tryin'"" is OVERRATED! And what was I thinking when I was about to buy his album. Goodthing that it was soldout or I would have been regreting it. Songs like ""21 Question"",""mini-man"", and ""in the club"" got played out (in 2003). So this album to me represent him telling life or death stories. But on his 2nd album what was there to rap about. So this cornball had to go after MCs that's far more Better then him to save his rap career. But i got a question in the 21 Questions......Will 50cent be in the rap game 4 yrs from now?"
2,What can you say but...,"50 Cent has catchy tunes that one could listen to once in a while, just like many other hip hop artists out there. Nevertheless hip hop just has to go.The time has come...LONG LIVE ROCK N' ROLL!!!"
2,Good example of the new era of music,"Now a days rap isn't judged by talent. Where were you the day rap died? It's the day when Eminem released his first LP, he has ruined rap and 50 cent CAN'T rap. You mindless white teenagers listen to this and think it makes you sound cool. But in reality you are too stupid to understand 2pac, Onyx, Wu tang and other good rappers. The only reason women like 50 cent is because he's ""hot"", only reason some guys like 50 cent is because they are f*cking idiots."
1,are you kidding me?,"This is some of the worst rapping I've ever heard. Honestly. The rhymes are kindergarten level, and he sounds like he is trying to rap with a mouth full of ice cubes. The beats aren't all that great either. Do yourself a favor and buy an album from a rapper who can rap."
1,"What'd he say?? Yo, 50, stop mumbling!!!!","Ok, so this guy has hot abs and sexy pecs. Thats it. His face, well honestly, looking at his face is downright scary. I KNOW he was shot 9 times and it's really cool he survived, but, they should really avoid putting his face on cd covers. Just show his torso.I might even be able to overlook his face if I understood ONE word he said. The mumbling is REALLY annoying and gets old very fast. He's very monotone and he is not pleasant to listen to. I guess he writes decent lyrics, but who can make out the mumbo jumbo that comes out of his mouth? Anyway, some of the beats are cool (In Da Club would be great without words) but, I have to agree with other reveiwers who hate the self proclaimed ""pimps"". How lame.Rap music has hit a new low, indeed. I beg of you, buy rap music from the 80's, when rap MEANT something, and avoid buying any ""rap album"" made after 1990. Thank you."
4,THE BEST RAP ALBUM I'VE HEARD IN A WHILE,"THIS WAS THE BREAKTHROUGH ALBUM FOR 50 CENT. AFTER SURVIVING 9 BULLETS AND AFTER SPENDING 4 YEARS ON THE UNDERGROUND CIRCUIT, 50 FINALLY GETS HIS CHANCE TO SHINE WITH THIS ALBUM. ''MANY MEN'', ''DON'T PUSH ME'', ''P.I.M.P.'', ''GOTTA MAKE IT TO HEAVEN'', AND ''IF I CAN'T'' ARE MUST-HEAR SONGS. THOUGH THIS ALBUM IS A FAR CRY FROM 50'S MIXTAPE SONGS, THIS IS ARGUABLY ONE OF THE BEST RAP ALBUMS OF THE YEAR. I DON'T CARE WHAT ANY RAP FAN MIGHT THINK, BUT THIS IS MUCH BETTER THAN JA RULE'S NEWEST CD. I'D SAY THIS IS WORTH $14.00 THIS CD CONTAINS 3 BONUS TRACKS, INCLUDING ''WANKSTA''."
2,Oh please ppl the new 2pac he definitely ain't,"50 Cent was, is and never will be the new 2pac. This album is one of the most overrated albums ever. In da club is the only decent track. People if u want some real rap go buy any 2pac album especially ALL EYEZ ON ME"
1,"""I have no talent! Where's my record deal!""","I bought this album based on all of tha hype. But after I heard it I took it back. This album is horrible. I still wonder how all these no talent punks get signed. I remember when people had to HAVE talent to get signed. His flow is horrible. Tha lyrics = gay. He is not A thug, gangsta, etc. Him and his fuccin gimmick about gettin shot. If you want real gangsta rap go and buy tha greatest rap album ever, Bone Thugs~N~Harmony - E. 1999 Eternal"
2,Bad for Hip Hop - Hard to listen to,"This album was hyped through the roof, but when you sit down and listen to it, really listen to it and forget the hype it become clear the album is a rushed lack luster album full of everything that is bad for hip hop. Yes 50, you were shot 9 times, but guess what not many people care and thos who did care have heard you say it 100 times already. The subject matter throughout the album is trite and sends a message that rap music is violent and 50 comes off incredibly shallow, its all guns and drugs. There is a song or 2 thats ok but basically I don't care if 50 got shot, gets high all the time, does'nt call the cops when he is shot or how much he hates lapd or nypd. Do us all a favor, make a reocrd of 2, get the money which is the only reason you are in the game and then get out- we are sick of you already. Your 15 min of fame is ticking away dude. Overall Dissapointing album."
2,could have been better,50 cent debut could have been better with his lyrical content. all the songs sound the same. the beats are the star on this album but for fifty himself in my eyes he falls short of being a great rapper like nas tupac or jay-z. and i believe this album was hyped up more by 50's personal life more than his rapping
2,"U Are Not Tupac , 50 Cent","I think it's shameful that this cd got the response that it got.What 50 Cent didn't steal from Tupac he stole from MASE in his music.All through the album 50 tries to be the new Tupac, flowing like him and even stealing a few rhymes from him.Do u want proof? put on for example IN DA CLUB by 50 cent and then take a listen at AMBITIONZ AS A RIDER by Tupac... or any song on GRODT for that matter...DO NOT BELIEV THE HYPE!"
1,this goof represents all that is wrong with ''rap'',"...........and rap has been mucked up for years.YOUNG MC,HURRY UP WITH THAT COMEBACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,An artist that doesnt ever change his subject,"50 cent is an artist that is al ways rapping about the same old thing cars women buying mansions and all of this but do they know how to work how to break a sweat they actually dont know because all they is write one song and put a beat to it and automatically a hit they always say yea i work hard on this album, yea they might of worked hard but now that they got money they dont even know wats a job anymore all they do is just go home do nothing and get free money sometimes what they write about things in this life is not true but sometimes they dont see that they are actually hurting themselves and what there children hear to me 50 cent can be a good rap artist if he just changed his subject."
1,doesnt deserve that star,"its emcees (if 50 can even be called an emcee) that is killing the essence of hip hop,hes a mix between nelly and an untlaented dmx,his old stuff use 2 be good but this is awful,this is bad pop music"
1,A FAKE TRYING TO GET MAINSTREAM...,"Everytime i see or read things about 50 cent i just have to laugh...Why? Because people actually think he's saying something that's never been said before...Another example of mainstream audiences (mtv/vh1 generations) being taken by the ""thug"" image that 50 cent TRIES SO HARD TO FAKE..THIS ALBUM ISN'T FOR THE STREETS,HOODS,OR THE GHETTOS..THIS IS FOR THE LISTENER WHO STAYS IN A UPPER CLASS NEIBORHOOD,KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT STREET LIFE AND WANTS TO FEEL LIKE ""A THUG"" SO THEY LISTEN TO IT TO FEEL LIKE THEY DISPLAY AND ""HARD"" PERSON..DON'T BUY THIS...A FALSE REPRESENTATION....AND I WANT EVEN GET INTO HOW HE TRIES TO SOUND LIKE TUPAC...-5 STARS"
1,get a dictionary,"Lots of hype, not many words. Pretty prosaic in my opinion. We all know ground, crown, and down rhyme; let's hear some ill connectors. Perhaps it doesn't work with his gun lyrics, but there are a few rappers who spit the gun talk with style. Not for those looking for lyrical creativity. Not hatin', just keepin' the mind elevated."
1,golfingstud@yahoo.com Yay!!!,"I like Christian music. None of that pozer Christian music like POD. I like the soft and soothing kind. Such as Mighty Lord, Shine Jesus Shine, and my favorite group is Sonic Flood. What is 50 Cent does someone have bad grammer because I sure could use 50 cents to give to my loving and sharing church. I would accept donations. Any good sugestions about good soft Christian music? Email if you do.God Bless You All"
1,Terrible....,i let this album pass by when it came out... but then 50 cent got hyped up and this was given as a gift to me.... and i hate it. It is very repetative and is extreamly boring. All the songs are lyrically the same. The album loosly tells the story of 50 Cent who after his mothers death turned to drug dealing and police informacu to survive. Though the videos are semi entertaining the album is not... i wish there was a 0 or -1 star rating
1,He wasn't even tryin' in the first place...,"This whole ""gangsta rap"" craze is a major disgrace. As much as I hate Eminem, at least his lyrics sometimes mean something. 50's don't mean nothin'. Okay, you're gangsta, we understand, we've had this whole ""I'm a Gangsta"" thing shoved down our throats for the past decade, and frankly, it's CRAP. Gangsta rap is worthless - I wouldn't touch it."
1,yea yea yea,"put your hand in da air, put your hand in da air, say yea, say yea, say we'z in the house, say we'z in the house...and you wonder why i gave it a bad rating? its amazing this Repetitive stuff sells!"
2,2 1/2 stars,"I'm not a big fan of 50 Cent, but I can tolerate this CD. The reason it gets 2 1/2 stars is because the CD gets old and repetitive, but it's tolerable. ALl 50 Cent really raps about is street violence and being the best. I can't really hate 50 Cent, because he dissed Ja Rule, which made him stop making more irritating music. It's bullcrap that 50's getting so much hype from the media and the so-called fans. How the hell could this CD sell more than Snoop Dogg's Doggystyle? I'm sure some of you remember when Vanilla Ice was cool. Then people started thinking he sucked (which he did anyway.) That's probably how 50's career will end. Everybody has to take MTV seriously on what's cool and what's not. Half the reason 50 Cent gets so much attention is because he got shot nine times. Too bad none of the bullets were fatal, then I could have saved $10."
1,this is a waist of money,"if u like music about thug life and about getting shot and having hard times u should listen to Z-ro instead of 50 cent.Z-ro from houston he speakes the truth.the has so cd's u can order from this wed site.""Look at what u did to me,""Z-ro V.S. the world,""King of da ghetto,""Life.""And another thang Z-ro don't like 50 Cent. any questions e-mail me djmoe5892@msn.com"
5,Holy ....,this cd has to be one of the best rap cds i've listened to in years. i love it. hasn't left my cd player since i got it and it's gonna be there for a while. Eminem definitly produced some talent and his input on patiently waiting is unbelievable... go out and get this cd
5,Don't Listen to that GUMP from COLLEGE PARK,"Hey this albulm is pure lyrical greatness. It's about time 50 got his breakthru albulm. I started messin wit 50 like 5 years ago when he was working on the unreleased albulm ""Power of the Doller"" and that was banannas too! If you like hip hop you'll do everything in ur power to cop this albulm...and watch the dvd too..tite work! Wit one disk he MURDERED blueprint: 2!!! Gzzu Gzzu G-UNIT!!"
5,the best of 2003,"I think one reason hip-hop was so popular last year was just because of this cd. I absolutey loved it for a long time, but i think i listened to it to much but it is still a great cd to put on now and then. The best track is deffiantly Backdown its really hot, they even reused the beat on the G-Unit cd in Beg For Mercy but made it a lil faster Backdown is better tho. They were right 50 Cent is the future."
1,TRASH!GARBAGE!NOT WORTH 50 CENT!,"This cd is terrible!If you wanna get a cd and actually like it then DO NOT get this one! It is the worst thing i have ever heard! It seems like all he talks about is trash... that you don't need to hear from someone, all he talks about is drugs and things about women that is totally offensive. If i were you i definently would not buy this cd!"
3,Average at best....,"Get Rich or Die Tryin' was one of the most successdully marketed and hyped albums in a very long time. Well, it's here, and quite frankly, it's just another average album. The production is really nice, but 50's lyrical skills leave a lot to be desired. There are a few really enjoyable songs here... ""Patiently Waiting"", ""21 Questions"", and ""Don't Push Me"" are my personal favorites. I don't know who put this album in the same class as Illmatic, Reasonable Doubt, and Ready to Die, but it's nowhere the level of those CDs... those are classics, and this is no classic by any means. It's an album to have because it's hot, but will they be talking about this album the way they do the aformentioned ones 10 years from now? 50's hot right now, but how long will it last?"
3,50 is hot.................In Da Club,"Props to 50. The album works for what he's trying to accomplish............GETTING RICH. The radio friendly cuts like ""Wanksta"", ""In Da Club"" and if my ears serve me correct the next single ""21 questions"" are just what an artist needs to collect the dough. As a club DJ, I think these three singles rock the party but even with production from the Great Doctor and the Great White Hope, it's a prime example that Hip Hop has lost its way. His flow is a little off and the constant ""gun talk"" gets a little old. We know he got shot 9 times and we're glad he survived. Compairing 50 to Pac or Big is outrageous. He's a rapper but the two formentioned were EMCEES! Big difference. Real Hip Hop heads (like myself), 30 and older understand what I'm talking about."
4,NOT BAD. A FEW SONGS COULD BE FILLER MATERIAL,"GET RICH OR DIE TRYIN' is 50 Cent's major label debut with Eminem and Dr. Dre at the helm of producing. The set is pretty solid; however some songs definitely sounded like filler material like LIKE MY STYLE, 50 QUESTIONS, and POOR LIL' RICH. Some songs are just downright solid bangers like IN DA CLUB, PATIENTLY WAITING, and P.I.M.P. This is the first time I've heard what Eminem had to offer as a producer, and its awesome! I highly suggest buying this set.Here are my top three favorites:1. P.I.M.P.2. DON'T PUSH ME3. IN DA CLUB"
3,Hype or Mayhem,"When 50 Cent's How to Rob landed in 1999, the hip hop community couldn't believe its ears. Here was a cocky young unknown from Queens blowing up about how hes was going to rob and mug every respected rapper in the business. So what happens? 50 Cent has been the target of anger and ineviltably, murder attempts. On the flipside, this got the attention of Eminem and Dr Dre, who decided that 50 Cent was someone who they could work with. But 50 Cent is set to be this years most talked about rapper. And there are moments on Get Rich or Die Tryin' which show that this hype maybe be as much about music as mayhem. 50 Cent has a great flow, his rhymes wrapping themselves perfectly around booming Dre beats (Da Club for instance). I think 50 Cent has a fine take on thug-life drama (Many Men) and a kool edge on hip-hop playas and pretenders (Wanksta). Tough, rough and add it to your collection."
4,Great CD except...,Alright this is a great CD no doubt. ...For the Explicit Version I'll give 5 out of 5.For the Clean Version I'll give a 4 out of 5. I'd give it lower if the CD weren't so great!
2,Just OK,"50's new album is not good, not downright awful, just OK. He has his moments lyrically, but most of the album is uninspired. He is definitely not as talented as some other rappers out there.The best part about this album was its production. Dr. Dre is a talented producer, and his contributions are what save this album from eternal [doom]."
3,Its alright.,"Well, all i have to say about this one.....well i dont have much to say. it aint that good besides in da club..but then again thats just my opinon"
1,50 IS SELF-OBBSESSED!!!!,"50's a good lyricist, his wordplay and everything is good, but he's soooo self-obbsesed!! Almost all of the songs contain references to Ja Rule or when he got shot, or some other thing he did. All he does is big himself up for doing all that stuff, or make fun of someone who didn't! The beats are pretty tight, but what do you expect out of Em and Dre?Another thing, the edited version is terrible!! They edit out words like high, gun, shoot, pop, and stuff like that!! IT'S INSANE!! If you're gonna waste money on this crap, get the dirty version. Or get a cheap copy of it so you don't have to waste money. The only song that's good on this album is Patiently Waiting, and that's only because of Em. 50 has good flow, but he's SOLD-OUT!!! He went platinum with this album, but he wouldn't have sold NOTHING if he didn't have Em and Dre!! (...)"
1,I really rate this cd with nough star,"I just hate the music in this cd, the lirics are just stupid, this cd is for stupid people, it just has no talent in it, you should better listen to dogs blare than listening this cd, sincerely i hope this short review gives you an idea of what a mess could be to buy this music. !Just dont buy it¡ Its horrible."
1,it's worth 50 cent,"This cd is horrible. This guy can't rap, write music, spell his mom's name, etc. It rips off from greats like Vanilla Ice and Eminem. Don't waste your money and time on this stinker."
2,only 2 good songs on this cd,50 cent sucks. this cd sucks. only a couple good songs. what a waste of money. ill download his new stuff before i buy it.
1,I don&#65533;t get the hype about 50 Cent,"I just don't get the hype about 50 Cent.I listened to this, and I think he is a, excuse the pun, two-bit talent."
4,this cd is alright,"it's always like this: when someone gets reallysuccessful, some people start hatin' for thereason that the person has made it. why the hellshould u criticize 50 for this album? it's got alot of good rap tunes (""Many Men"", ""Back Down"",""Bloodhound"", ""Poor Lil Rich"", ""Wanksta"" are myfavs), and yeah he doesn't rap like others he'sgot a little speech problem but why should u disshim for that? he's spitting real street sh**. he'srappin' the way thugs talk. respect this man 4 doin'it & stop hatin'!"
3,He Has Potential,"That is what I thought after I first heard Get Rich or Die Tryin. Then came the dreaded lyrical step backward called The Massacre. Anyway, Get Rich is a decent album. It is nowhere close to a classic but it is bearable and you might find it entertaining not enlightening. For any rap fan, I recommend this album. Though Fifty is not an amazing mc, this album is still average."
2,mediocre,"this has average production, lyrics aint good, rapping skills are average too. this album gets tiring to listen to. it sucks if this went diamond and sold of 10 million cause it doesn't deserve to go 1 x platinum. there are much better albums that only went gold you know.listen to the ART OF WAR or EAST 1999 by bone thugs, those guys are talent."
1,Good beats...,The best thing about this album are the beats. 50 just doesn't have anything new to offer as far as rhymes go. Listen to any of the tracks featuring Eminem and you'll see the huge gap in talent.
4,50 Cent - Get Rich Or Die Tryin',"This album is hot. It definetly lives up to the street hype. Great production from Dre & Eminem and good lyrics. Not too many guest appearances either, which is unusual nowadays."
5,2nd gangsta album,this album is gangsta all the tracks are hot!it aint as good as his first cd power of the dolla but this album is still hot!patiently waiting is the best song eminem rips this up.back down is hot he gets at ja and the beat is hot.p.i.m.p. is ganngstalike my style is gangstaif i cant is hotthe rest of the album is hot but those are the hottest tracksget this album and power of the dolla
4,pretty good,"This album is good, but not the best thing ever. The people who think that 50 cent is better then Eminem are very screwed up. I dont think that 50 cent has the rapping skills or the music to ever be better than eminem. In Da Club and 21 questions are the only truly great songs on this album. I do recommend this album. When compared to Ja Rule, Jay z, and Nelly this is a work of art. When compared to Eminem, Tupac, or Nas this is just another THUG album. But it is worth the money"
2,GIVING CREDIT TO WHOM IT AIN'T DUE!!!!,"Let's face it, anyone who has heard the 50 cent album will know that it is nothing spectacular. The beats are tight (naturally, since it was Dr. Dre and Eminem). Besides the beats, this album is wack!!! I bought it expecting to hear something to blow me away, but i was extremely dissapointed. Though i liked the track Patiently Waiting because of Emimen's wicked rhymes and his mad flow, i also liked Don't Push Me, because of Eminem's and LLyod Bank's masterful touch. But let's face it, 50 can NEVER be the next best thing. Besides his unique voice, he has just one thing that's appealing and that's his producers. Thumbs down to 50 cent on this one."
5,Many men DO wish death upon him...,"Overrated, underrated, NOT rated? Written and spoken by the same people over and over again. HATERS. No wonder why he wrote 'Many Men'.I don't care how many people say he's a sellout, you got to give the man credit. Now, how many rappers nowadays can spit ""What up Blood?"" on a record and get away with it? Hmm...that's what I thought. His lyrics? Real. His demeanor? Stylistic. The beats? Dope. And you won't believe how many people are trying to imitate him now. Fine if he's an influence, but don't try and claim you're him. Not gonna fly.Best track? I couldn't give you one. This is one CD in my collection where I can truly say I can listen to it the whole way through and not change one song. Closing in the words of 'Patiently Waiting'--if you think he's a f***in' falloff, you're so wrong."
2,rap's copy cat,By doing the same things that put pac on the charts 50 is on top of his game right.well dr dre and feminem are making him the best is so biutifle that his growing up @#!# 50
4,Good beat,"Certain songs just ""grab you"". Love the beat. Looked high and low for this before I found it, but it was just one song I had to have."
1,Black horse & the cherry tree,"KT Tunstall was great BUT I was charged $20 for a two track CD on which a label stated ""expect to pay no more than $2"" so I find it hard to give a star rating as I enjoyed KT but was screwed on the price!!"
1,Dissatified,"I wish I had understood that there were only 2 songs on this CD. A ripoff for the price.I really like KT Tunstall, wish I had ordered Kaleidascope (sp?) instead."
1,music write 2000 standard,Very difficult to use. The program trys to do too much and as a result it doesn't do any of its functions well. Very user-unfriendly. Does not allow enough bar-lines per stave (only four).
2,Difficult,It probably isn't worth buying. There are two many options. The program dosn't let you put an eighth note right after a sixteenth note or a quarter note right after an eighth note and so on. Ties are difficult to put in. It's not so bad but it still isn't worth buying.
2,"Elementary, No Impact","This book, while giving a decent overview of practices that are known to be effective, does not provide ""how to be a shining star"" or how to ACTUALLY grow beyond just being a simple start-up.This book is elementary level, at best. The core concepts here are commonly, well-known and easily visible in the world of business from your neighbor's convenient store to your local Wal*Mart.Don't clutter your bookshelf."
5,A gem.,This is a love story set in 19th Century England. There is a great deal in it that is visually beautiful. In my opinion this production is a gem.Philip Martin
3,Persuasion,"I enjoyed the 1995 version better, though this one is faithful to the book. ""Anne"" in this version was a bit too old for the part even though she is beautiful. To me she looked older than Captain Wentworth. ""Louisa"" was a bit too gushy. ""Mary was a little too pretty. She didn't get on your nerves like Sophie Thompson (Mary) does in the 1995 version. She just whines alot. I forgot ""Elizabeth"" because she doesn't make an impression at all."
1,Junk,"Junk from the first moment. Watched total of 2 minutes before dumping it. Boring accent, boring scenes, just a lot of blah blah........ big time boredom."
1,Persuasion sucked!!!,"My mom, my sister, and I watched this film and it is very corny. I left the room about an hour into it. I can stand most bad movies but this one is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It doesn't even deserve the one star I'm giving it."
3,Not true to the book,"I found this version of Persuasion difficult to watch. In this version, Anne Elliott puts herself forward far too often and is the center of attention. However, in the book, she is neglected in her own family, her opinions unimportant and unsolicited. The production qualities that others have commented on were not too far off many of the other BBC productions of classics done at the same time. Overall, I was disappointed."
2,no comparison!,"The actress playing Anne was 38 at the time! Apart from that, there is no comparison with the exquisite portrayal by Amanda Root in the 1995 movie."
3,"I love this novel, this isnt the best video version!","I love all Jane Austen novels, especially this one even though it is one of her least known. The BBC, who produced this film, is faithful to the text, perhaps too faithful. I prefer the 1995 version, also a BBC production. Its is also interesting to see them one after the other and study the different nuances."
3,Not nearly as good as the 1995 movie,"Everyone should note that the wrong cover is shown (This cover is one of the ones made for the 1995 movie). People may accidentally buy the wrong movie. While one of the better movies from that BBC era of Jane Austen adaptations, it pales in comparison w/the near perfect 1995 Persuasion."
3,It was pretty good - though rather slow - Anne was annoying,"This movie was a bit slow-going. It was obviously low-budget (there was a sickly yellow/green tint to it) The acting was good - but the comments about Anne's hair are so true! Forgive me - I know she's a Redgrave - but the way she talked was so annoying. The scene where she reads the letter written by the captain was Superb! But then she ruined it with her, ""Oh, Frederick, Frederick, Frederick!"" (it was more like Freder-icchh, Ferder-icchh, Feder-icchh) I just can't stand the way she talks! I would recommend the Root/Hinds version although neither are really outstanding."
1,This was awful.,"I did not like this adaptation at all!! Persuasion is my favorite Jane Austen novel and the 1995 version with Root and Hinds IS the one to watch. This BBC adaptation from the seventies makes you laugh for all the wrong reasons, (the ""Regency Bouffant"" hairstyle of ""Anne"" is a howler! Every scene is dominated by her hair. ) I was sorry that I wasted my money."
4,If you can get past the dated costumes...,"If you can get past the truly disturbing 1970's influenced costumes and hairstyles of this production of Persuasion, you will find a faithful adaption of Jane Austen's stunning novel.While I found the visual look of the film to be off (it is not even to be compared to A&E's magnificent Pride & Prejudice) the dialogue and acting are well-done and the story moves along well. This is the kind of meticulous movie that takes days to watch; it's far too long to manage in a sitting.Since Persuasion is one of my favorite Austen novels, my review is admittedly biased. I could easily overlook the terrible scenery and costuming (oh, those 70's gowns!) and immerse myself in the story. Try renting this one first to see if it suits your tastes."
2,Not Faithful to the Book and Really Bad!,"This is my favorite Jane Austen novel next to Pride and Prejudice. The Masterpiece Theatre versions of classic novels have usually been very faithful to the books, but this version deviates drastically and tediously expands the story to four hours. Every subtle nuance in the book is drawn out and explained just to fill out the time. Thank god Masterpiece Theatre improved and got better. The 70's versions of Emma and Pride and Prejudice are fantastic. The movie version from 1995 is more faithful to the book and the characters as well as being great!"
1,Absolutely Atrocious,"I decided to watch this after reading the book (for the nth time) and watching the Amanda Root/Ciaran Hinds film. I nearly laughed out loud, but it was far too painful for laughter. The feel of the production is that of an early Monty Python skit without the jokes, although the actress playing Anne is unaccountably amused most of the time. Even taking into account the low budget and primitive equipment of the time, this is a poor effort. Haven't seen the ITV 2007 production yet, but it's got to be better than this."
1,Save yourself tedious hours,"Picked this up at the library. I can't say one good thing about it. The costumes were not authentic fabrics for the period, the editing was sloppy, the cinematography downright stunk, it dragged horrendously with a ""walking"" scene that was ludicrous, the acting was like a ""first read"" at community theatre (maybe worse), the Admiral flubbed most of his lines, the lead, Anne, looked much older than she was supposed to be....and what was with that hair? They were all just reading their lines...no emotion whatsoever........Save your precious time and don't watch."
2,Makes a favorite story BORING!,"This out-dated, low budget adaptation is awful. It does stick to the book as far as events and takes the time to tell the story. But it makes one of my favorite books seem so dull! I struggled getting through this one. If you're a fan, I'd recommend the Amanda Root version."
1,Worst movie I have ever seen,"I do not feel that the actors fit their roles and everyone seemed as though they were reading their lines from a sign behind the cameras. The movie should have been cut in half, and the plot would have come across to the audience better if they had chosen a younger female star. There was too much casual conversation that was not necessary to move the plot along. No passion was in the acting.I couldn't identify with the main star and I could not sympathize with her situation because she didn't seem to show remorse for the rejection of a man who would have made her a good husband."
1,persuasion,"I enjoyed side A, but side B wouldn't play, so I went through the process of getting a refund as there was not guarantee that the next DVD wouldn't have the same defect. Amazon has refunded the full amount."
1,Sugoi onchi,"This 7-track, 23-minute CD of a 3-girl band from Shizuoka, Japan consists of barely passable guitar playing, but whatever merit the guitar playing may have is ruined by the terribly off-key lead singer."
5,Way better movie than I expected,"OK, it IS an Ed Wood movie so it ain't all that good. The acting was wooden, everything was done on the cheap as expected, ect, ect. But not a bad movie all and all. The plot was easy to follow, there was a little bit of intrigue. And the fight scene featuring Ed Wood himself posing a a thug, which seemed to go on forever, was worth the price of the movie by itself.Negatives........the ""burned to order"" format is kind of crappy. The root menu is confusing although if you just start with the first thing to come up you will get through it easily enough. That could have been done better. No info on the slip cover either, other than the title and what amounts to an ad for Sinister Cinema, but nothing about the actual movie itself. That could be doctored up a bit to at least point out that this is a Woodie. But it seems if you are ordering this in the first place you would know that.Buy it, it is a ""Lost Woodie"" that most folks don't even know about let alone have seen."
5,Get The Urge!,"If you're an Edward D. Wood Jr. fan, just buy this DVD and shut up. It's what you crave, and you'll love every minute of it!"
4,Farberware Fan,"I have purchased other pan sets and yet always seem to come back to Farberware....I would like to point out that this set does not have a proper sized skillet (10 inch). The 9 inch is great for grilled cheese or one hamburger, and the 7 inch for frying eggs. I had to purchase additional pans to ""round out"" this set, which is why it only got a 4 star rating."
5,Like this set very much,"This is the only name brand cookware that comes withFarberware Classic Stainless Steel 10-Piece Cookware Setdifferent size pots, which was a buying point for me. Got rid of OLD pots and pans. Being retired and cooking when granddaughters visit is nice now."
3,more pots than pans,"if you like to boil your food. then this is your set. there are so many pots in this set, take notice on that! the pans are very tiny, they are not very useful for 2+ ppl cooking... mostly fry some eggs..."
2,size of the pan differs too much,The small pots are too small and you can't stir the food if you don't want to mess up your kitchen. The big one is too big and it's for making soup for 10 people. No medium size pot.
1,Not best quality or customer assistance,"I got these pans for a wedding gift 11 years ago. Yes, 11 years is a long time, but I selected what I thought was a well-made set of pans that I hoped would last a lifetime. One large lid that fits my 2 largest pans recently broke. The handles pieces have come apart and cannot be reassembled as the parts are stripped. I emailed photos of the broken pieces but was told that this could not be accepted as proof of the broken product. The company verbally offers a replacement ""if the product is still available"" but only if I mail in the pieces in question. With the prices of shipping and the question about whether they'll actually ship something that fits my pans, I feel really disappointed in Farberware products. I wouldn't recommend this brand for durability or customer service."
1,"Nothing ""Classic"" about his set","Cost of steel is up, so Farberware cheaps out -- instead of the steel lids on traditional Farberware, and the lids that are included in the larger ""Classic"" sets, this set has far less durable glass lids. For years Farberware has cut corners by including thin, cheap no-stick fry pans in its sets, but this is a new low. Maybe in a few years they'll be selling plastic pots and pans? A real shame -- another American brand that once signified quality now makes disposable products."
1,DONT BUY THIS,"This is the worst product ever, don't buy this. This is not non stick.. they show you pictures of both the pans that are non stick and sell you all 5 of them. We got cheated by this scam beware folks"
4,Bought 2 sets,I bought two sets of these for my daughters. It was a little confusing that the description and the picture were not the same. I thought there was an extra stock pot included. Farberware classic is always a good choice. I'd like a set for myself! Kudos on the careful & fast shipping.
2,You Get What You Pay For,"We bought these for a Florida rental unit understanding that we would not get quality pots/pans for this incredibly low price. I would not recommend them for every day, long term use because of their cheap quality. Also, the handles are made of a lightweight plastic so make sure they aren't near the hot burner! On the bright side, the lids fit nicely and there were various sizes of pans and pots to accommodate most basic cooking. If you are looking for better quality pots/pans, I would not recommend these."
4,Family thing,I have used Farberware for years. This is a gift. I give the set as house warming gifts. No one complains.
5,Best price for what you get!,"These look like they would be in a professional kitchen, and only $70. I definitely Could not be more satisfied!"
4,Nice pots,"I saw the skillets were non stick and I assumed the rest was to, but they are nice pots and I love the skillets."
3,Cook Ware,I ordered this cookware because I already own a set that was suppose to be exactly the same....but this new set is much lighter in construction than the original set I have that was purchased several years ago. I am please in evey way with the cookware except that it is lightweight.
4,almost perfect,"I love the farberware cookware. the pots are perfect. some lightweight pots my wife purchased actually warped and thus rattled on the stovetop. since i am the cook, it drove me crazy. i threw them out in less than a month. the only ""problem"" and the reason for 4 not 5 stars is the non-stick pans. I hate the non stick surface because they scratch and can leave toxins in the food . cant convince my wife that you must use wooden utensils, so i just threw them out"
1,Not worth the money,Received this set UPS today and returned to Amazon.com today also. Made overseas from thin cheap steel. Faberware has sold out their reputation by backing these sets of poor quality stainless steel. Bought individual pieces made by Hamilton Beach from a local kitchen store and got better quality and a better price.
1,I hate it!,The skillets were very disappointing since they are not stainless steel which was one of the main reasons I ordered the set. They do not work on my stove so they are pretty much worthless to me.
1,Gear- Up Single Oak Wall Bike rack,"This wood bike rack does definitely does NOT ""hold up"" to its competitors. Not only did I hang an extremely expensive bike, the bike itself is incredibly light weight - so I thought it could hang properly on the wall via this wood unit. Within a day the whole thing ripped apart and came crashing down. Other bike racks I have purchased and are currently using are doing the job just fine! This unti is obviously NOT engineered properly, and most importantly NOT safe.I also had to PAY out of pocket for the amazon return.Net Net... DOn't Gear UP!"
4,Great little rack,"I had purchased one of these several years ago and when I needed one for a second bicycle I was a bit disappointed from reading the product review. But I went ahead and made the purchase. No problems with the rack whatsoever! The arms are strong, assembly was easy, and my Trek is now hanging from my loft. I used the provided assembly hardware and a bit of wood glue just for good measure. Again, no problems at all. It's an attractive-looking little rack for a single bike."
4,Good Summer Collection,"Warmth of the Sun is a good compilation of summer songs inspired by the Beach Boys and others. There are a few unknowns included, but this CD is essential to any summer collection. It is still secondary to 25 All Time Greatest Summer Songs on the Varese Sarabande label (available from Amazon.com) which has a greater variety of original summer hits done by the original artists."
2,"Dissapointing, considering...","that David Barron has some excellent audio and video products. I was really expecting great things from David when I purchased this book, based on some of the other quality items I have of his. But there is nothing new herein this very brief book that hasn't been covered more extensively in other and better NLP and sales related books such as Donald J. Moines' ""Unlimited Selling Power,"" a must have for any sales person.So, if you're familiar with NLP you'll find nothing new. If you're new to NLP and Hypnosis, there are better more extensive materials out there."
3,Rock N Read,"This children's program features recordings of children's songs from Vicki Peterson and Susanna Hoffs. It's a nice addition to your Bangles collection and, if you have children, they'll enjoy it too."
3,The Speedometer - Not Necessary,"The speedometer works fine, however, it is not really necessary and doubles the price for your exerciser. If I did it over again, I would get the Dynaflex Pro Plus Gyro Exerciser, which is GREAT (see my other review) and pass on the Speedometer."
3,A good start,"I bought this book as a present for a woman who hated it. The 14-point type made her feel like she was getting baby talk, and the clothing/wine tips were gimmicky.Well, yeah, but although the clothing/wine tips seem silly at times, theadvice is mostly good. On 11-12 the authors point out that grape variety is a more consistent guide than European blend-names like Bordeaux and Chianti but fail to note that grape-variety labeled wines (like Sangiovese) in the USA and most other places need contain only 75% of the variety on the label (while Italian Chianti must be at least 90% Sangiovese).The book is aimed at novices, and the comments about using untinted or etched wine glasses are right on the money. Still, why Riedel? One can find perfectly fine glasses at Tuesday Morning at 1/4 the price of Riedel.It's a mixed-up book, but not a bad one."
3,Not as good as the first one,"MTV carries a lot of weight and that's why these stars continue to sign release forms to appear on the show being embarrassed and punked....the show drags a bit this 2nd season...I thought the driving school, blink 182 skits were the best ones...but this season was not as good as the first one with nick/jessica, oscar delahoya, seth green...those were classic episodes...The profanity and language (uncut) on the dvd is downright foul and a turn off....just bleeping it you can get the same effect without having to hear the negative vibes of bad language....ashton seems to be more involved with these skits as he's workign the backroom on each one as opposed to first season where near half of the shows ashton doesn't come in at the end and say gotcha!overall its ok...the bonus punk on Al was funny...wilmer got em....but this set is better rented than bought...buy punk 1 but not 2...my reccc...."
4,Punk'd Season One,"One day afterschool, I switched on to MTV and I saw this new show Punk'd. From there I was hooked. I'm sad that it won't be back for a third season. My favourite episode was when Omarion from B2K got Punk'd and Bow Wow was working with Ashton. Everyone should have a copy of Punk'd season one! This show ROCKS!"
1,Not that the show is bad but .....,"I am really not knocking the show .. but more questioning, Why would anyone feel the need to actually spend money on a show like this ? I mean come on .. just turn on MTV ??Once you have seen an episode .. and the celebrity is punked... why would you need to have it on DVD? Is there people that really want to watch the same GAG twice ?? that would be boring .. save your money and just watch the NEW shows on MTV !"
1,Boring,"A ripoff of The Jamie Kennedy Experiment. Honestly, who wants to see some bum trick celebrities? If you want some hidden camera stuff that's actually entertaining, get JKX season 1."
4,Come on guys--,"Come on ya'll- Some of the episodes on the first season were really funny! For example, the Justin Timberlake episode!"
1,No,Bring back the Lyricist Lounge Show and the original MTV Jams.I remember I was so excited when they had MTV Jams on and they played nothing but strait up banging hip hop from the 1990s.Then there was the Lyricist Lounge. for you people that only watch todays rap videos you missed it. It was just dudes having skits and just doing great rapping. Look at 106 Park and Freestyle Fridays and times that by a hundred and your close to the Lyricist Lounge. some of the members were Kweli-Mos-Words-Em-Big and even of tight people who are no names. and as plain white said bring back shows such as The Tom Green Show are atleast put out some DVDs. As for this junk I believe it is a step or two a head of the excellent show-Pimp my Ride. Tell MTV to start showing some PIMP rap from 1994 like Nas or Snoop are DJ Premier beats. I hate that punk Ashton Kutchar and all I have to say is Bruce will kick yo white Azz.
2,The suckiest hidden camera show,"OK, this is the most unfunny hidden camera show. If you want a very good one, chose jamie kennedy experiment. That is a good show. This is just not funny and annoying."
1,Closed Captions?,"Are there subtitles on this program??MTV, all full-length streaming content require closed captions and I don't see any indicated in the product description, so I cannot watch this program as a hard of hearing person."
3,"It's good, but after a few times...","I bought this DVD last week because it was only US$7, and I hadn't seen any of these episodes on TV, since I don't have satellite TV...well, the first time it was great, it was so funny, and not that long, so cool. The second time, it was still funny, but not as much as the first time, but after the third time it started making me sick, I found the stories boring, plus I had already seen each of them twice, just bad. Thank God I didn't spend 24 bucks to buy it!I think that if I had MTV at home, I wouldn't have bought it."
5,A Great Encore For Elvis,"""Rubberneckin'"" was the hit song from Elvis Presley's last feature film, ""Change Of Habit."" As the B-side of ""Don't Cry Daddy,"" it reached #11 on the charts way back in December of 1969. With the staggering success of the remix version of ""A Little Less Conversation"" from last year, it's only natural that another Elvis song would get the remix treatment. It may sound sacrilegious to Presley purists, but I like the remix version of ""Rubberneckin'"" even better than the original version! In fact, I like the extended remix version most of all. That version really features the twanging guitar part near the end. If that isn't Duane Eddy playing the guitar, some guitarist is doing a great impersonation of him. By updating Elvis Presley's sound, it introduces his music to a new generation of fans. For older fans of Elvis like myself, this CD single whetted my appetite for the upcoming ""Elvis: 2nd To None"" album."
4,Elvis is always good,"I saw the Christmas movie this song was in and really liked it. So I bought the CD. It could be better, but it could be worse, I think it has a little to much base to it, when I downloaded the MP3, my computer could not handle it, it just came out distorted. It keeps Elvis out there today. The current music world is lacking, so if you want to rehash Elvis, it can't hurt. There will never be another Elvis......"
5,Correction....,"The original ""Rubberneckin',"" unlike one reviewer stated, did not reach #11 in December 1969 - it actually peaked at #6 (the same position as its a-side) beginning on January 31, 1970. It's a fantastic rock & roll classic."
1,Jason Nevins did better,"Paul Oakenfool has turned out another bland remix. No surprise. I lost faith in him after his boring, no-fun remix of ""What It Feels Like..."" for Madonna. Faster Kill Pussycat & Starry-Eyed Surprise are his only favorable songs. Jason Nevins' remix kept the flavor of the original and added a Fatboy Slimish style to it. Go on iTunes and buy his remix of this. It's much better. ELVIS, YOU ARE SADLY MISSED! YOU WILL ALWAYS BE THE KING!!!"
5,Another winner from the library of Poe...,"As always Edgar Allan Poe has created a masterpiece with this work, just as he has done with all his others. He makes haunting, chilling, and tingling stories come to life like nightmares during the daytime. He was a true master of suspense and storytelling and this work is no exception. If you enjoyed any of his others, like The Tell-tale Heart or The Raven, then you'll be sure to enjoy these tales of terror and detection."
4,Quite accessible,I checked out this book from the library this summer trying to find an easy version of Poe. This version is very simple. There are few words that need explanation for struggling readers. I liked it so much that I decided to buy 20 copies for use in my classroom. October will be great!
3,Not the best of the series.....,"Good book, but it was halfway over before the mystery began. The book did hold my interest, however."
4,Pirate ghosts in Collinsport?,"""Centuries ago Jenny Swift ruled her cut throat crew of pirates with a blacksnake whip. New, legend says, her ghost styli guards the treasure ship where it sank in Collinsport Cove, meting out death to those rash enough to seek her gold. But Norah Bliss and her father, both salvage experts, are skeptical. Invited to Collinwood to recover the treasure, they accept eagerly. At Collinwood Norah finds herself in a different, more menacing world. Despite hints that Barnabas Collins is a vampire, she falls in love with him. Then, suddenly, Jenny's ghost stalks her. Is Norah too, sated for death? Or will Barnabas be able to save her from the deadly blacksnake whip?"" (The plot synopsis is taken from the back cover of the first edition paperback. #29 in the series.)"
1,Wrong Item - Does not match description,"The item that was sent to me was not the 3-quart oblong dish, instead I got a divided dish. I even returned it hoping that it was just a one time deal, but I received the wrong item 3 times. Amazon was great about sending it back to me, unfortunately, it was always the wrong item. Looks like I'll have to shop elsewhere for this product.I purchased a 2qt dish with a lid from them and received the correct item, so it appears to only be this product that is wrong. They definitely need to remove it if they are not going to send the product listed in the description."
5,Never stop laughing,Raising Hope is one of my Favorite shows right now. I always laugh really hard and usually non stop too!
2,this item is a burnt copy,"recieved my order on time. but noticed the cheap plastic and looked at the back of the discs, they are a cheap purple burnable disc. fox has not released this yet for real, BUYER BEWARE!!!!!! i have to say though that they did work fine in all of my devices but 25$ for something that isnt even real is a bit bogus. love the show though hope they keep it longer than earl..."
1,No Subtitle :(,I thought it will Be Like Season 1 Release But Sadly No Subtitle ..Expensive for a very simple DVD .
2,5-Star Show gets 2-Star DVD Treatment,"I know they just ""burn"" the show onto DVDs for you now when you order it, but couldn't they at least have sprung for a subtitle option? No subtitles or CC available makes this worse than saving it on your DVR where you can at least CC. Even if you stream them you can usually turn on the subtitles so why not find a way to include them? Add to that poor picture quality and a shrunken DVD case insert and this is a cheapo DVD output given a price that's higher than I paid for the subtitled, special-featured put-out-by-the-studio Season 1 set I bought. Two stars just because I'm happy to at least have the season on DVD..."
3,"Raising Hope, Season 2",My son loves this show. He has season 1 and I got him season 2 for Christmas. My son is hard of hearing and there is NO closed caption available on these disc. Season 1 did have it. It would be helpful if that information is mentioned in the DVD description and information you show.
5,Best paper for Canon printers,"I tested my new Canon i960 with a variety of papers. Like most printers, the output is much better when using the manufacture's own paper (as opposed to the cheaper generic paper), but there is no need to buy the most expensive ""Pro"" paper as neither I nor my wife could discern ANY difference between the two. There may be a benifit to the ""Pro"" paper that cannot be seen (lasts longer?) but at almost twice the cost it is not worth it - this paper will produce the highest quality prints on your Canon printer (I think they look better than the ones I get from the photo lab)."
5,Don't use plain paper,"I just got my Canon i550 printer. I printed out a photo on plain paper, and the quality is very bad. I was so disappointed. I started to doubt people's praises on the Canon printer. Then I bought the Cannon Photo Paper Plus Glossy, and was stunned at the printed result. It's dark room development quality. So I guess it's the combination of the printer and the paper that makes it look good.Price: 50 cents/page + ink = less than $1/page. The price for 8x10 development on ofoto.com (a Kodak's company) is four times more expensive at $3.99.Quality: StunningDimension: I don't know why 8.5x11 has become the standard for photo printing. Most frames out there are 8x10. Do I suppose to trim the printout myself?Borderless: it's almost borderless, but my printer gave me a border of 1/16 inch on the top and right of the paper. I used the A4 size on Canon Photo Print application."
1,Poorly Argued.,There are so many arguments set forth in this book that are poorly researched/argued that it's hard to recommend it on any level. Other reviewers have said enough. Buy something else!
4,Strictly,"This is one hell of an aggressive, as well as a controversial Cd. It is a bit better than tupacalypse, but still not as good as all eyes on me. The way he put things into words on this Cd just shows his talent and how he was light years ahead of everyone else."
3,2pac getting low!,Album is good. but the lyrics r different from his other albums. I was looking for a CD like THUG LIFE but kind of dissapointed.Some song r very good and worth mentioning like:Strickly 4 my N.I.G.G.A.ZPapa'z songLast wordzHoller ya' if u hear meOthers r very different and his voice is kinda craking down there.Burn it. Dont buy if u r looking for old tupac.This is my first time saying to burn a 2PAC album but it's true...... :(
5,A classic album,From the greastest of all time. Show s up biggie smallz. No wonder he has sold more than any other rap artist check this out
4,K.J. The Terrorist sayz buy this joint if you wanna rep.2pac,"2pac's sophmore album continues the ruff and rugged hardcore stuff he started with 2pacalypse Now. Holla if you Hear Me, Last Words and other tracks on the album are true classics. No 2pac Shakur collection is complete without this powerful album. Not Ignorant Getting Goals Accomplished Don't get it twisted."
3,No Signs of A Sophomore Jinx In This Case.,"Tupac Amaru Shakur immediatly come out swinging with ""Holler If Your Hear Me"", with it's riot-inciting lyrics it perfectly sets the tone for what is to come on ""Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z..."". This album is loaded with hot tracks like: ""Last Wordz"" (feat. Ice Cube and Ice-T), ""Souljah's Revenge"", ""Keep Ya Head Up"" and ""I Get Around"". At point in Pac's career this was the best album of two album career, but this album is nothing but a HINT of what was two come in his following LP's. This is another must have in your music collection."
2,His Worst,"Yo, for some reason, I have to lable this as his worst cd, the beats [stinks]. I reccomend anything by him except this cd. I'd just download the two good songs.2 Stars for the like 3 hits he has on the cd. Not much love but gotta have love for any [person] makin' money"
4,Classic Album,"This is classic 2pac album. ""I Get Around"" with Digital Underground is one of the greatest rap songs of all time, so is Holla If Ya Hear Me, and Keep Ya Head Up. This is a great album, pick it up along with All Eyez On Me, and me Against The World."
4,Solid 2pac Album,"This is a really good CD, but it is not Pac's best by a long shot. Me Against The World & All Eyez On Me completely blow this album away. But this does not mean that this is not a good album, because it is. There are a few really good songs like Keep Ya Head and I Get Around, my favorite song on this album is the title track. I think that this CD would be a lot better if the production wasn't so low-quality. I'm not saying that the beats aren't good, but on some of the songs you can barely hear Pac's voice. This is a CD that would be worth a digital remastering. But Overall I would say that this is must-have for any true 2pac fan it is better than 2pacalypse Now and it is definitely better than Until The End Of Time."
4,"Reviewer ""Reggie L. Mattocks"" says it best","This album was VERY underappreciated for a variety of political reasons.TuPac was many things to many people ... loaded with contradictions, like this album that ranges from the inspirational high of ""Keep Ya Head Up"" to the G'ed Up ""I Get Around.""But isn't life also a contradiction? (Yes) And doesn't the best art imitate life? (Supposedly, yes)If you've just gotta have a TuPac album to really understand his poetry and what made him standout from so many rappers, cop either this LP or preferably, TuPac's 1991 debut ""2Pacalypse Now.""Those albums are literally being studied in college classrooms (deservingly and appropriately so!) as I write this review."
4,Back to the Underground Sound,"After 2Pacalypse instantly brought Pac to super-stardom in the rap world, it seems he decided to take his work back underground, which is implied in the title of this album. This is probably my least favorite of Pac's albums before his death. It takes a little while to get into because the first half of the album doesn't have too much substance as far as the beats go. However, Pac's lyrics carry him through on this part of the album. His lyrics are at times really hard and at times intellectual, which is what brought him respect by some and hatred by others. However, by the second half of the album, the beats really start picking up and the lyrics just don't stop. By the time you get to ""Representin 93"" it's too late to stop and the songs just keep getting better. So overall, I would say that this does turn out to be a good album and a good second effort from Pac. If you don't have it, get it and don't waste your time on his post-mortum albums."
3,"Again, Tupac shines!","Tupac shows his chops in rapping and his lyrical skills, while keeping the public who wants him to be a gangsta interested in some tunes...the man delivered and was a true poet of our times."
5,Excellent anti-establishment lyrics,"This album is rough and has a definite underground feel. The best tracks are 1.Holla if ya hear me , strictly 4 my niggas and last words. This is violent, paranoid, and aggressive tupac at his best, although the cd is dotted with a couple of songs that are more lighthearted. They are not the reason for buying this CD. If you like hip hop artists who candy coat their view of life, buy sean combs (puffy) crap or that dmx guy with the lame voice."
3,Tupac Shakur,"This is 2pacalypse Now part 2. It is just as raw/rough and that is the Tupac everyone enjoyed. Not that his Deathrow releases were anything but amazing, however nothing compares to 1991-1995 Pac. This album was quite overlooked however it contains four singles (Holler If Ya Hear Me, Keep Ya Head Up, I Get Around, and Papa'z Song) all great tracks. Keep Ya Head Up is my favourite out of those, a real classic that proves Pac can write a song without bad language and violence etc, which is a thing that most rappers can't seem to do. Its no wonder his the number 1 MC of all time. On this CD I like the following tracksHoller If Ya Hear Me, Point The Finga, Souljah's Revenge, Guess Who's Back, Representin 93, Keep Ya Head Up, Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z., The Streetz R Deathrow, I Get Around and Papa'z Song which are all top tracks from the best rapper of all time.R.I.P. Tupac Amaru Shakur aka the best rapper of all time"
3,R.I.P. TUPAC,tupac is awsome its just some of the songs I cant get into it but still the songs that are hot are hot anyway I wouldnt recommend this for somebody that liked the real thugged out Pac maybe more for the political Pac but its a good CD
3,tupac,"not one of his best, but i get around and keep ya head up are good songs. 2pac blasts dan quale on this cd after he attcked tupacs debut cd. a good cd for all tupac fans"
1,Yawn,uuuuhm did I mention. Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawn!!!If you like yoga then try it. It was my first time trying yoga and it was so boring. To me it was 1 star cause it was dreadful. This is my rating for MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE.Rating the product- it works fine and gave no problems. If you like yoga then ignore my review.Did not make me feel any better about my pregnancy workout either and the reason is surely obvious- I did this almost once. I got too bored to continue.
4,"Followup LP to fluke 1970 hit single, still sounds fresh","In many ways the optimism and light folky sounds of this LP are a time capsule of 1970. But kindergarten teacher Rita Abrams' songs are also a rather timeless chronicle of the challenges and joys of childhood. Her borrowed 3rd grade class (according to the liner notes) brings the songs to life with actual childrens voices.This has been out of print for 20 years, yet it still feels remarkably fresh. Its recording (and the resulting fame) may have been a fluke, but the single and LP both hold up quite well, and are sure to bring a smile to parents and children alike. If you're wearing out Carole King's ""Really Rosie,"" add this one to the CD changer."
5,Innocence of Childhood,"This is a happy, inspirational album with great songs. I would definitely recommend it."
4,Great Stroller,"I love this stroller. it is heavier than other umbrella strllers, which is a bonus. It doesn't feel flimsy like the lighter weight imbrella strollers. My daughter is 7 months old and very squirmy. it is easy to fold and lift with one hand which is priceless if you live in a large city. I just wish it had a bar across the front and it would be perfect. I have no complaints, it handles nicely and the price was awesome. I also own a Graco Quarto Tour Deluxe and love Graco products. i do wish the seating postions were a bit better, but again, overall, this stroller is amazing."
4,"Good, compact, stroller","We wanted a compromise between a compact umbrella stroller and a large, durable, one. This stroller gives us just that. It's rugged and provides a smooth ride. Easy seat adjust. Easy setup and collapse. Fits nicely in the trunk --smaller than a golf bag. Only complaint is the canopy. It can detach easily during stroller setup/collapse; and it only has 2 positions (expanded/collapsed). The height of handles is fine for both my wife and I. I am 5'11"" and she's 5'3"". I don't have to hunch over. Overall, this has been a great stroller. We've had it about 2 1/2 months now."
4,Good umbrella stroller for bigger kids,"I bought this for my almost 2.5 and 4.5 year old boys - we wanted something more ""significant"" for their bigger sizes. It fits them well, it's a little tough to turn, but maybe with more use, the wheels will turn faster. Nice height and comfy seat. It doesn't sit completely straight up, and a tray or cup holder for sippy cups would be nice, but overall a nice size for bigger kids."
4,Good stroller,"I like this stroller because it's compact and pushes nicely. I love that it reclines! The only thing I don't like is that sometimes I kick the wheels when I'm walking because they're close together, but most umbrella strollers are like that. All in all, it's a great stroller!"
4,It's ok,"After some research, we decided to buy this umbrella stroller, because of three things:1. Space: Even Though we have a pretty good trunk space in our minivan, our huge stroller was taking more than 50% of that space, with this one the problem is solved.2. It is really easy to fold.3. It reclines, so our almost 7 month old girl can still take a good nap.What we don't like about the stroller is the shade. This shade comes off really easy.Overall it is a good stroller, if it weren't for the shade, we would give it 5 stars.Update: Our daughter is 3 1/2 years now and still uses the stroller. we have taken this stroller to several trips abroad, to cities with extreme hard to walk sidewalks. The stroller is still in good shape. I highly recommend it."
2,Terrible sitting position,"I bought this stroller based on some reviews. The majority were good including Consumer Reports. But a couple reviews mentioned this poor sitting position. The stroller has an adjustable seat but in the full upright position you can very lightly pull back on the seat and it will drop right down to a 45 degree position. The very motion of my toddler getting in to the seat and sitting back, for example, was enough to push the seat back. I returned the unit. Luckily, Amazon has this postage paid (Amazon picks up the bill) return option."
2,Returned it,"I bought this stroller for my upcoming travels, needing a maneuverable and lightweight but sturdy stroller. When the Graco IPO arrived I had to do some minor assembly including putting on the wheels which I could not complete because the push-in locking assembly for one of the rear wheels was stuck inside the leg, making it impossible to securely attach the wheel. So it went back that night. I got a Maclaren Volo instead, which requires virtually no assembly, is smaller, and is more maneuverable although I found the Graco IPO to be easier to fold and unfold and I preferred the darker fabric. I don't think the Maclaren is completely worth the price, but for me so far it is better than the Graco IPO."
2,How is this going to hold up to 50 lbs?,"The construction of this stroller is sturdy and relatively lightweight. Our main issue with it is when it's in the recline position our 2 year old, who is about 36"" and 30lbs, her head would be almost over the top of the stroller. And there's this ""pouch"" for the head that just fits her current height, so I can't imagine how a 35-50lb child would fit comfortably in the IPO. I'm sure this stroller is great for pre-toddler children, but we were looking for something light and maneuverable for the occasions when our toddler is tired and wants to rest. Maybe they should advertise this as up to 50lbs and up to 36inches."
1,back seat collapses even when brand new,"I received this stroller as a gift. Even before using it for the first time, the back seat stays collapsed in the horizontal position.The customer service told me the would send a new piece, but I have doubts it will work since I read in many reviews that it does not solve the problem.I am REALLY disappointed with Graco.Bottom line : You get what you pay for!"
2,There are better choices,"I was excited when I found this stroller. I thought it was a great price for a reclining umbrella stroller but this is a case of you get what you pay for and the low price is not a value. The canopy on this stroller is terrible, that is my biggest complaint. I have since replaced it with a Baby Planet stoller."
4,Graco IPO,"Doesn't allow my child to sit perfectly upright but otherwise is great. Handles are high so I don't have to hunch over to push it and the wheels glide easily over rough NYC pavement. Steers easily, folds with one hand. Heavier than my old Peg Perego Aria but I don't have to lift it often. Also purchased buggy buddy as recommended. Small basket holds a blanket, rain shield and a few other small odds and ends. I'm very happy with the purchase."
5,Great product,I love this stroller. It's nice and compact. It's just what I need for my two year old when I travel. The multi reclining seat is perfect for when my child falls asleep and it's easy to manuever.I am very happy with this product.
4,Easy stroller,"I really like this stroller with the exception the canopy falls off fairly easily. But really easy to push, light and doesn't get hung up when you are trying to get around doors."
3,so so,"i bought this product because i want to have a lighter stroller during the summer.it's lighter than the travelling system but much heavier than any other light weight stroller. i don't mind the extra few pounds and it's much steadier compare to others light weight stroller.but it is not easy to push around, especially in the mall. the front wheels somehow have problem to row properly on very smooth surface. i have to use strength and concentrate really hard to make sure the stoller does not go side way and bump others.plus, the canopy is really a waste of space and doesn't protect my baby from the sun at all."
2,Loved it at first but...,"I loved everything about this stroller, but I noticed after a few uses that the front wheel does not touch the ground,so the stroller veers off to the left constantly. I have 4 boys, so I need something that I can push with one hand, and it was very hard to push. I returned it BRU with full intentions of getting another one, but noticed the floor model was doing the same thing, and the one at Target did the same thing as well. I am disappointed because everything else about the stroller was great!"
2,Graco umbrella stroller,"I looked at Consumer Reports and reviews on-line before purchasing this stroller. I was not happy with how heavy it was and the shade comes off everytime you close up the stroller (the only good thing is that it closes up compact and very easy). I also have a regular combi stroller that I bought with my combi carseat and infant carrier and that's far lighter and manuevers better. I would not recommend this stroller if you're under 5'3"" and small frame because the handles are made for someone around 5'7"" or taller and it's heavy to get in/out of the car."
5,mommy2two,"After my two boys outgrew both our Graco travel system and the duoglider, I needed something lightweight for my 2 year old. This is perfect! It saves space in the car when we travel with it and is very comfortable for my son to ride in. It is a bit heavy for an umbrella stroller, but on the upside it is also very sturdy. I can put lunchboxes and other items in the basket under the seat and hang my purse, diaper bag and shopping bags on the handles and it does not tip when my son gets out. I found it to be extremely easy to put together ( I didn't even have to consult my husband) and have had no problems with it so far. We've traveled all summer with it. It is even comfortable enough for my 3 year old when he is tired."
1,Do NOT buy - Go for quality (even if it costs a bit more)!,"We bought this stroller beginning or middle of June and right from the start it gave us trouble. The axle to the wheels were misaligned and the front wheels would not touch the ground so going for a walk was always a struggle steering! I met another lady in my building who saw me struggling with the stroller and she mentioned that her Graco stroller had the same problem! We are so disappointed because it one of the only strollers that has a seat that can be placed horizontally so baby can sleep comfortably. We only wish we saved the box so we could return it. We just bought a McClaren which I can now steer so easily (I can even steer with one finger and it goes where i need it to go)! We learned a lesson - with strollers, go for quality even if it costs a bit more!"
3,Dont think I would purchase again!,"I loved this stroller when I first got it. It was a bit high in price for a umbrella but it has a great shade, big storage and hand tall handles to push it! There are a few things that I dont like about it; the wheels have been getting stuck and its hard to get them to push straight. Also, when I have picked it up it has started to unfold leaving my finger to be smashed very badly between the metal bars. Not just a little smashed, My finger has been left black and blue and bloody. This has happened on more then 2 occasions!!! I am always worried every time I pick it up! Other then that its a stroller. I am kind of in the middle on this stroller. Hopefully if you decide on it you have better luck then I have."
3,ok stroller,"I like the look of this stroller and the fact that it is lightweight BUT the back part of the stroller (backrest) is not that sturdy and seems to fall down whenever he moves around too much and another thing that is happening with my stroller is that the sun shield keeps coming undone from one side, it seems to be too loose, I wanted to return this stroller but couldn't because I didn't have the original box it came in....oh well, good thing it wasn't that expensive."
4,Good sturdy stroller,"We like our Graco IPO for its compactness and simplicity in opening and stowing it away. The stroler also has bigger cargo room to allow you to bring more items.There is only one thing, it is not as lightweight as we expected. We compare it to our Graco travel system that we have, and I think they weight about the same."
2,"Great for moms, not for babies or toddlers!","This stroller has a horrible sitting position, the sides are not padded so when you baby falls asleep the head touches the metal frame and the baby gets a mark because of that plus sometimes his head gets stuck in there. But for a mom is perfect! Light and easy to maneuver. Please before you buy this stroller think about your baby being comfy."
3,several issues..but it does the job!,"Anyone else find the seat back moves with the child when used in 5pt mechanism & reclined? the entire thing lifts up if he sits up.the buckles are cheaply made for the price.i like the light weight & ease of fold.perfect height handles for me at 5ft 5 inches. My 5yr old weighs 45p/43 inches & fits, as well as it pushes ok, but her head is bunched in the canopy. my 2.5yr old is 36 inches & is perfect height wise.this should state not good for kids over 40 inches/50 pounds.basket is decent,i bought cups n cargo as an add on item.adjustable footrest on the seat is great for my little guy.canopy is not the greatest, but I'm spoiled from my baby jogger city mini gt! I bought this for quick trips where the city mini is too big/bulky, like dr office or small stores.it does the job for that but I'm still looking for something better!"
4,Good stroller,Pros: Good stroller. Very light which is important to me. Nice design!Cons: vibrates on irregular floors. The basket under the seat is small.
5,New stroller rocks!,This stroller is a replacement for a handmedown that was 8 yrs old. Wow the improvements are remarkable. Not a bad price for a quality product. Thanks!
5,Love,Love this lotion. This is my fav scent and the feel of the lotion is awesome! Smooth but not greasy or sticky yet keeps hands moisturized thru a couple hand washes. The kimono rose is a really lite and pleasent scent.
3,Can barely smell,I love the fragrance of the body wash and lotion. This roller ball is really tiny and barely has any smell to it at all. I have never tried the cologne but I wouldn't buy this again.
3,Clean and Fresh,"I like the scent of the perfume, but I LOVE the scent of the body wash. The perfume is a little too sweet and not spicy enough... I have to add another fragrance in order to balance it out.. but it's nice... just not fabulous."
1,meat grinder plates,"First of all the plates were what I wanted however the diamter is wrong. it is too small to fit my grinder. There was no mention of what size grinder this would fit. it fits a #5 and mine is #8. It would cost me more to return it, so I am stuck with them. I will have to find a store that actually sells the exact size plates.In the future I would suggest the seller put down what size meat grinder the plates fits. If unsure they should ask the purchaser."
1,Test Strips,"Item arrived in a very timely manner. (today, 12/20/12) Unfortunately I use one strip per day and the pack of 100 expire the end of February, 2013. New glucose meters do not allow usage of strips after their expiration date. Will end up discarding about 40 strips, almost 1/2 of the order."
2,not impressed,I've been poking my fingers for about 30 years and my hide is getting pretty tough. These lancets don't penetrate my skin much at all. They might work for people with small fingers and the ones just starting on the road to diabetes.
5,Great product,Smooth quick service. I will buy product from this dealer again. I have used the product for over 5 years.
5,Simple and pain-free,"Love these lancets - they are very simple to use, and practically pain-free. The multiclix pen is small enough to tuck into my meter's case for on-the-go testing."
5,Hygiene and practical.,"I like this product so practical and hygienic, not like others who puts single lancet, and are uncomfortable. I Liked."
5,Multi Clix,"Product was as I expected, I sent for the catridges to insert in the device that I have as opposed to buying a whole new product"
1,Make sure good item,"My item is no box, I don't know used or new one. And they said 102 each (lancets) inside but I see only 24 lancets. http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews?ie=UTF8&action=preview"
2,Did not specify the expire date of the item,The expire date of the item was not specified. It is expired in one month.
3,"Promising first novel, fresh voice","What's most distinctive about ""Utterly Monkey"" is its voice -detached and ironic, smirking, a bit boozy. Laird has a gift for quirky turns of phrase and idiomatic goofiness. The plot is of not much consequence, and character development is a fairly flat arc - there are interesting characterizations here but the novel's actors tend to blur into the same voice.""Monkey"" occasionally rises to level of quality writing, and Laird shows some serious promise."
1,Almost useless,"I have had these pruners for some months now and finally have removed the rotating handle so I can get at least a little use out of them. I did have high hopes that this ergonomic design would reduce hand fatigue but it doesn't. The rotation makes them very difficult to hang onto and almost dangerous from slippage. It may work for some people, certainly not for me. I love my standard Felco pruner and am hoping I can replace the rotating handle with a static handle either through Felco or by fashioning a handle myself so these expensive pruners will not have been a complete waste of money."
5,Complete your study of U.S.History,"Usually African Americans are not included in our History texts. This book 'fills in the gaps'. It covers greater and lesser known African Americans who have influenced U.S.History from the Colonial Era to the Civil Rights Era. It contains biographies, stories, and reproducible activities."
3,Beware of a defective screen - you will be stuck with it!,"Make sure you carefully examine the picture using the actual unit you will buy, and if you are mail ordering it, make sure you have a good return policy that allows returns for screen defects. Sharp will NOT replace units that have even very noticeable flaws. I have a unit with a region of dim pixels the size of a pea, and they consider it to be 'within spec', and WILL NOT replace it. I made the mistake of taking it to the authorized repair facility, instead of returning it to the vendor immediately. It took them four weeks to finally shoot me down, by which time I could no longer return it to the vendor. Now I own a very expensive television that makes me angry every time I watch it. NICE JOB SHARP!!! They will definitely be at the bottom of my list for my next purchase. Too bad, I used to like their sets."
5,Great picture. Arrived in great shape,"The TV was delivered to our home in rural Texas on time and in perfect condition. Kudos to the shipping company. The set has a great picture and no discernable banding, a problem noted in many earlier reviews."
2,Banding Banding Banding,"I decided to roll the dice after hearing the mixed reviews on this set. Unfortunately, my number didn't hit. While this set has fantastic specs, especially after tweaking the settings, the results are moot. I have three large bands that run from the left to the right of the screen. Sharp keeps saying they are working on a fix, but nothing yet. If this unit had no problems, it would be a five, but how can Sharp not recall a unit with glaringly obvious defects?"
2,"2 TVs, 2 cases of banding","It took only a couple days for me to notice horizontal bands about a quarter of the way down from the top of the screen. They were most pronounced on solid-color backgrounds, but most severe on gray/black backgrounds. At first I thought I could deal with it, but when I watched HD channels my eyes were constantly drawn to it and it got really annoying. So I took it back to the store (luckily the appliance store has a generous return policy) and exchanged it for another one, hoping that this one wouldn't be afflicted. Unfortunately, same story, distracting horizontal bands, except this time they were closer to the middle of the screen and even worse. I think I'm going to take this one back as well and get a different TV altogether. The HD picture is great if you can ignore the bands, but it's just too much for me."
5,AMAZING,This TV is incredible! I hooked up my G5 to this computer to watch DVD's in 1080p and it is sharper and brighter than my Apple Cinema display! Regular DVD's look fantastic! But remember this is an electronic item; there are no guarantee's that your unit will be in perfect working order. So protect your investment by getting something like the Best Buy protection plan. Everybody needs a tv of this quality in there home. This is a must have for lovers of tv shows and movies.
1,New TV Doesn't Work,"I ordered my new 46"" Sharp TV to watch during my surgery recovery. However 6 weeks after my ""new"" TV was installed, it still does not work. I am being told the AV board needs to be replaced however getting the Sharp warrenty contractor to replace it is almost impossible. I am now being told it will be another 2-3 weeks before it is fixed. Sharp customer service is nice but obviously has little stroke when it comes to making the repair happen."
3,Not enough options,Pros:-good price-response time-lookCons-no cable card-only one input for antenna/cable usually I expect two-no 1394 connection or other cards
1,"Sharp Aquos 46"" Flat screen",I bought this Flat screen 14 months ago and main board went out. They told me repair was $1400 and were totally rude when I said TV is one year old and should not have bad board unless board was defective to begin with. Cindy Ranes basically told me to eat the TV and was totally useless to talk to on the phone. I would never buy another sharp product as it seems they make expensive throw away flat screens. Go ahead and buy if you want but be prepared to toss in a year or so as they are garbage.
1,"Horrible Picture quality, banding issues. Good Audio","TV properly broken in. Using S-Video inputs. Using DVD and DirecTV sources.Problems:1. banding that everyone talks about2. picture quality is bad. i tried every setting in the menus to tweak it. color reproduction and fragmentation are the notably bad effects.3. my remote died after a year. prob due to bad batteries. but nonetheless, other remotes of mine have stood up to that b4.the ergonomics of the remote is horrible btw. really really bad.Good stuff:1. surround sound is awesome for a tv. but doesn't matter or come into effect if u use a 5.1 system externally."
5,Sharp Aquos and 1 Happy Customer,"I just purchased this unit, installed it and i love it I have 2 other units LCD and a Plasma and it is the best unit of the three. Great picture and brilliant display!"
1,Avoid Sharp,"Purchased this LCD from SharpDirect 3 weeks ago, its been broken for 2 weeks now and counting. Sharp does not want to replace it, they want to fix it in my home. The service technician does not work for Sharp. They are from some local third party. I own both a philips and a panasonic HD TVs that have had no issues.I have spent the past two weeks trying to sort this out with Sharp, but all I have received has been either incorrect information or no call backs.Spend your money elsewhere."
1,STAY AWAY FROM SHARP!!!!!!,"After having a Magnavox TV for over 30 years without a problem, My family decided to update my parents to a LCD bigscreen.I thought this was the one to get..I was wrong.After a short period in time,the LCD screen went out.Lucky it was still under warranty.BUY A DIFFERENT TV!! SHARP HAS SERIOUS QUALITIY ISSUES!I don't know if it the cheap labor that assembles these or just faulty components!!Stay away from SHARP!!!"
5,Steven Seagal's action classic now on Blu Ray at a new low price!!!,"Under Seige is now available on Blu ray at a new low price,this is one of Steven Seagal's best films,the PQ,and sound is great,the only extra is a trailer fir the film!!! It's ""Die Hard"" on a battleship!!! A great Blu Ray for the price!!! A+"
4,Battleship Blues !,"Normally I don't care for martial arts films, but it is not emphasized to a great extent in this one. Seagal is great as a former Navy Seal turned cook. Tommy Lee Jones is flamboyantly evil as a terrorist. Erika Eleniak provides the eye candy while jumping out of a cake. Lots of suspense and excitement."
2,CORNY,"Too corny,Seagal not believable in role as SEAL. Nothing more to say. bla bla bla bla \bla bla bla bla."
4,Awesome,This movie is good. It's DIE HARD on a battle ship. The movie is about Seagal who is a chef and is forced into action when the battle ship he's on is taken over by Tommy Lee Jones. Great movie.
4,One of Steven Seagal's best films ever made.,"I had first seen this film on DVD and I immediately liked the movie. The performances by Steven Seagal, Tommy Lee Jones, and Gary Busey were the best ever. The action and the story was fast-paced and kept me entertained. I don't think that this film is a weak or depressing one at all."
4,Steven gets even,"Segal has, by far, put out the best martial arts films ever.I really liked his 1st 4 movies when I saw them. They were very entertaining. This was entertaining, had a great plot and was well acted. Tommy lee jones and Gary Busey were good also. looking back on his(Segals) earlier films I realized just how big a movie this one was for him, considering that the movies he made before this one were good, but had lost there appeal. This one is a classic."
5,Excellent,"Wonderful special effects, as well as dialogue.Steven Seagal is at his best in this epic film on board a Navy vessel."
1,"The movie is fine, Amazon streaming stinks","I like the movie, but could not get past the first 15 minutes due to problems with Amazon streaming. Several times as I was attempting to watch the movie, the streaming would stop with an error stating their were problems connecting to the server. However, Internet access to any other site worked fine."
5,great fun,I like movies where there are clear good guys and bad guys.....and the good guys win big in the end. This is just that.
4,Acting Lessons Needed,"This is a decent action movie taking place on the WWII battleship Missouri. Tommy Lee Jones does his usual good job of being a tough bad guy. The one woman on board ship (there are women in the Navy, but I guess this director is a sexist) is a Playboy Centerfold flown in with all the undercover bad guys for the Captains birthday party. Of course she strips for our viewing pleasure. She is a flake who in less than 1 minute of instruction, becomes competent enough with a machine gun to charge into battle and kill. And how in the world did Steven Seagal ever become an actor, he doesn't pull off tough guy, poses for muscle shots of which he has little, makes ""mean"" faces and generally is unappealing as the leading man, and of course he gets the girl. So just watch it for the action and Tommmy Lee Jones."
4,Imagine what he would do if someone complained about his food!,"Definitely one of the better of the ""Die Hard on a (fill in the blank)"" movies that came around in the early nineties to capitalize on the success of that film.The movie spends enough time setting up the characters (both good and bad guys) to ensure they are more than cardboard cutouts, then launches into the kind of non-stop action that is a hallmark of the genre. Picking the bad guys off one at a time while protecting the innocents is always fun, and it is even better when the person doing it is underrated by the bad guys (which is why he's a cook/former navy SEAL).Fun stuff for a Friday night with popcorn."
2,A case of too much perfume,"Worst blu-ray disc I've seen so far.It so grainy I actually stopped watching it.I own the standard Dvd and that's almost perfect.This is a total ripoff.Don't buy it.My father was the only bread winner when I was teenager.Almost always,when he came home every evening he would say 'when you've got too much perfume what do you do? you spray it on your A**'.This was because we used to have all the lights on simply because they could be switched on and he was paying the bills.Roll forward 30 years,and now I have too much perfume(money) and what did I do? I bought a hd dvd version of this movie because the blu ray version was too grainy.You could say it was money down the toilet.The HD dvd is worse.Until it is reissued properly or remastered in blu ray, don't waste your money?1 star for video transfer."
3,Average action flick.,"This is a very average film. The plot and acting are nothing special and the only thing worth noting is Tommy Lee Jones' role as Strannix. So watch it if you have nothing else to do, but if you want a real good action flick, then I suggest you watch Die Hard or Commando."
1,Under Siege,"My god! I can't believe how many people gave this film 5 stars. It's absolutely awfull! Don't get me wrong, I like action films, but this was one of the most dire films I have ever seen. But then, all of Segals films are a pile of steaming you know what. FOR GOD'S SAKE, SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
4,"A younger, leaner Seagal","This is probably one of Steven Seagal's better films. Plenty of action but he doesn't come off so much as the cocky, swaggering, full-of-himself putz as he does in later films...or try to sell ideas"
4,"Very good bluray, other then some grain now and then!","This movie really rocks, it has tons of action thanks to Gary Busey, Tommy Lee Jones and Steven Seagal. On the issue of grain, you do see some especially in dark scenes but otherwise the picture itself is very good, and this bluray is better then the dvd, anytime! For 8 bucks, you simply can't go wrong!"
3,Middling fun,"The Bottom Line:Under Siege is one of those not-actually-good action movies that's smart enough to keep its tongue in its cheek and deliver some goofy dumb fun alongside generic action sequences and a paint-by-numbers plot; don't let anyone tell you it's a good movie, but watch it if you like stupid action.2.5/4"
5,Probably Segal's best movie....,"How can you go wrong with the supporting actors in this one! Great plot, plenty of action. It is a shame Steven Segal's movies went down hill, for the most part, after this one."
4,Great movie,"I would say 92% of the whole movie was cleaned and sharpened for HD. Other 10% of random scenes exhibited alot of grain and snow. Still a major improvement over the DVD release that I have viewed multiple times. Only wished they cleaned the whole movie. You won't miss the untreated scenes, extremely grainy. Otherwise, still a great movie in my opinion, but still a movie like this made on america's last battleship to be decommissioned in the early 90's now a museum is quite a site.."
2,BAD DVD TRANSFER,"Even though I've never been much of a fan of Mr. Seagal I remember having enjoyed this movie when it first came out on the theaters. And since Amazon had a good price on the Blue-Ray version of it, I decided to purchase the disc. What a disappointment! The movie starts out fine but very soon the picture becomes extremely grainy and full of noisy artifacts, to a point of distraction. It was difficult to enjoy the movie with so many annoying snowy picture. If I could I'd return it, but it's not worth the trouble. The only thing I can do about it is to vent my frustration at the people responsible for putting this turkey out, and to warn the potential buyers at what they are getting into when the buy this Blu-Ray version of Under Siege.Thanks!Rudasi"
4,The best Seagal movie by far,"This movie is from the brief period at Warner Brothers when Steven Seagal had decent budgets and good co-stars. This is an obvious ripoff of Die Hard, with Seagal in the Bruce Willis role, Tommy Lee Jones in the Alan Rickman role, and a battleship substituting for an office building. There is an inherent appeal in these movies as the badly outnumbered hero gradually knocks off the bad guys before finally confronting the head villain. Of course, Seagal can't really act, but that's not actually required here. Ex-Playboy playmate Erika Eleniak contributes a brief -- but formidable -- nude scene. (It's interesting that Erika manages to make it through all the slam bang action without breaking even one of her inch-long red fingernails.) All in all, a great popcorn movie for those who like non-stop action (with, of course, non-stop violence)."
5,WONDERFUL,"I love this book, it is one of my favorites and it never gets old, I read ot over and over again."
5,Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince Greatest Hits is a Fantastic Find!,When I found this item on Amazon I was very excited. I love stuff from the 80s and 90s music era and I love quirky stuff like this. It did not dissappoint. Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince Greatest Hits is a Fantastic Find! It will be part of my permanent collection for ever!
4,a good book to read,"The Art of Maneuver is a good book worth reading. Leonnhard talked about many problems in in the U.S. Army right now, from the way we think to the way we fight. In the second part of the book he talks about the weakness of the U.S. military tactic - air land battle. He pointed out that air land battle could not deal great destruction to the enemy force than we normally expected. It was shockong when I first learned it.But however, Leonhard did not gave the solution to the problems he pointed out, it is a great disapointment to me. Because of that, it made the book more of a list of complains."
5,Perfect.,"""Do you want to attack/kill your enemy or defeat your enemy?"" If you want to defeat him with lowest resources, read this book."
5,This is one of the best books I've ever read!,"I think this is a great book on maneuver, because of both the content and style of writing. Even if this is the first book you've ever read on military strategy, you won't be in over your head. Leonhard also uses plenty of historical examples to support his writing, something that too many authors don't do.However, read carefully, since memorizing maneuver and understanding it are two different things, and that is why maneuver is an art, not a science."
4,Challenges the fundamental military thinking used by the U.S,"Leonhard has practical experience and a thoughtful approach that help make his radical precepts of war convincing. Highly resistant to a number-crunching approach to war-planning and war-fighting, Leonhard tears apart the thinking that drives most U.S. military policy. Using a central theme of maneuver as a superior tool to attrition, Leonhard actually sets up a framework of effect driven choices for planning, response and analysis of war. He powerfully opposes the reduction of any conflict to a battle model by offering a paradigm of approach driven by the resultants of victory - pursuit and exploitation - rather than an approach limited to the attainment of decision. Pretty readable, given the highly specialized subject matter with a well organized and richly informative style that has held the attention of all I have inveigled to read Art of Maneuver. Recon-pull yourself a copy."
2,Awkward,"I bought this case because the plastic one that came with it originally cracked and wouldn't hold the phone securely. But when I read the reviews of the replacement case, they were not good. I will probably go back to the original style again.The major problem for me is that this case design makes the phone stick out from my belt significantly. It catches on things. And for some reason the phone flips open frequently. The second thing I dislike about it is that moisture seems to collect between the clear plastic windows and the phone ... no I don't swim with it ... I have no idea where this wetness comes from.The good thing ... it looks OK and is what is advertised, which is more than you can say for a lot of stuff these days!"
3,Will break if futzed with........,"I bought this 7 months ago.Pros: nice looking, stylishhas opening for micro SD cardhelps to protect phone if you're a clutz like meCons: covers up the volume control, camera and voice command buttonsswivels a bit too easilytends to ""sweat"", moisture underneath......which leads me to....case breaks if you try to remove! I wanted to dry off the moistureI'm going to try and find a better one, otherwise I'll just have to buy the same thing again and don't try to take it off this time!"
4,As Advertised,"The quality is good. The plastic around the ear side is a little sharp, so you can't press you head so firmly to hear your conversation."
3,Track listing,Believe that the track listing here is in error. It should read:1Your Enemy's Asleep2The Curious Organ3Without Your Love4All the Little Girls and Boys55/46The Night Wears a Sombrero7Conventional Lullabies8Turn on Your Weakness9Trespass on a Thought10Satellite
5,Good Stuff,"This is a fun, talented punk group. Every song on ""Blackout"" rocks, and the lyrics are right on. ""I Lied"" (#8) through ""Alone"" (#14) just fly by, and each has it's own catchy tune and fun lyrics. I've got a 9 year old son, and while the lyrics are pretty salty (I sing loud, different words over them), he loves the beats.""A Study in Economics"" (#9) has a little Cheap Trick sound, and ""Pegleg Sullivan"" (#12) is a great piece of Chicago story telling. This CD is well worth the few bucks."
5,Great book for a picture of earlier times,"I actually used some information from this book when giving a tour at the Van Alstyne House in Canajoharie, NY, relaying the information about the Dutch colonial days....It kind of got me into trouble as it was about the cleanliness, or the lack of cleanliness; with body odor and the smoke filled dresses at church. They haven't called me since...oh well?"
1,DOA,"Item arrived DOA, would not work at all... dealt with a good merchant though who refunded full purchase price."
2,Whataya mean I read this book?,"I think his stories about battle are believable and everything else is nonsense. No colorful characters, the story jumps around and it is short."
5,A must read for Seal fans,This is a very good book to read for Seal fans because Miller takes u into the minds of seals during their ops in vietnam.
3,Disjointed and disappointing,"I appreciate everything that Rad Miller, Jr. did for his country, but this book is a poor testament to the men of Special Forces in Vietnam. His unedited, unpolished style of writing might appeal to some, but I found Miller's style to be annoying, self-glorifying and, frankly, probably a little fanciful. Miller tries to convince us that SEALs are the ultimate warriors, yet he details his screw-ups and his colleagues screw-ups. Unprofessional behavior that would normally get you killed fills the book. I don't know about SEALs in general, but this guy wasn't a patch on the Green Berets that I know who served in Vietnam. Just goes to prove that the best of the best are the ones that you never hear about or read about."
1,"""Keystone Cop's,not Navy Seals""","I was very disappointed in this book.I have read all the others books by ""Seals"" and this did not come close to any of them. Oh' it's entertaining for a passage or two but that's it.This book also has a lot of padding. Details you or I don't care about.This Seal team is nothing like the other's. How they weren't all wiped out is the biggest mystery and the real story in this book.."
3,Do not judge this book by its title,The only reason why I read this book is because some one told me my uncle was in it. So I read every page looking for a mention of him. I was pleasantly surprised that the book commented on how misguided the military was. The author was very candid about problems with the Vietnam War. He definitely did not try to glamorize the war nor did he come across as some type of brutual killer which is the impression that the title cover of the book projected.
5,Fantastic,All the Assist Manuals are some of the very best social skills manuals I've used as an elementary counselor!
3,a wee bit disappointing,"I found myself a bit disappointed with Spooky. I loved Gala so much and perhaps expected something like... more of the same, which is invariably a mistake with a great band. Spooky is an album I can play and leave and it is all right for the background, but I don't really feel gripped by it in the same way as with Gala, or even with later Lush albums."
3,Run of the Mill,"I was new to Lush and I knew very little about them other than what I heard on the radio. I was not that impressed with the album. It was O.K. and kind of interesting at times but, it generally lacked some of the more enlightening trance qualities of the genre. It was intriguing enough to give one of their other albums another try but, I don't think this is a good album to buy if you're new to the band."
5,Lush is Progressive Pop,"The one thing which no one reviewing Lush's albums seems to notice is the level of harmonic maturity in their songs. They never take the easy or obvious resolution in a cadence or turnaround. The modulations are subtle and sometimes abrupt. Who cares about the lyrics. Whoever wrote the music (my guess is its the guitarist) knows their harmony. Any jazz musician would find soloing over Lush tunes to be as challenging as much of the jazz standard catalog. This is not jazz but the level of songsmithing is there hidden behind layers of distortion. The other shoegazer bands arent even close. Lush is progressive pop, like XTC and Todd Rundgren, and Kate Bush."
5,Felt the chill,"Well done documentary about the real roots of hockey. Open air hockey on the POND! Commentary from elite players, coaches and hockey lovers."
3,Went to the actual premiere of the actual film in Minneapolis.,"I sat right behind Neal Broten at the premiere. Being a Minnesota native, a hockey player and growing up on a pond myself, I was honestly disappointed with the lack of substance in the film. Granted, there wasn't much a a budget and the production quality was a little weak, but with this much access to so many people who love the game you would think the character selection would have been better. See for yourself... Make your own judgement, but coming from a hockey player who lived on a pond playing day and night, there's a lot missing from this story. The journey and the story are poorly organized as well. It's a bunch of random players talking into a camera. I give it 3 stars because I love the concept and love the game. This was a seriously missed opportunity to do something really special. Bummer."
1,Boring,"I am more than embarrassed that I fell for the rave reviews and gave my husband such an awful gift. As an avid hockey fan and former player, I thought this was a great gift for him. Wrong! He watched 63 minutes of it and gave up waiting for the good part to start - the best he could say about it was that it was BORING. I sat all the way through it and can't argue about that. The few cameo appearances by the likes of great players like Gretzky can't spark any life into it. I was hoping for a really great film. This is not it - my husband said if I paid more than 99 cents for it, I paid too much - which is not fair since the clam shell it came in is worth that much!"
4,Long Overdue!,"My review will be short and to the point. This is a very good cd. Along with the cd of his Warner Bros. recordings you have all his hits, plus more. I would like ""Palisades Park"" more if it included ""Cuernavaca Choo Choo""; less successful, though one of his best songs (Bo Diddley fans know); and a personal fave of mine ""Oh, Gloria"" (b-side of ""Everybody Monkey""). Maybe someday....still a great, long overdue cd. Anyone know why he was left out of the Cameo-Parkway box set?Bill A."
2,"Mile wide, inch deep","I was disappointed when I first got this, though I admit that I should have looked at it at the library first. This may be helpful as a ""first sort"" for students who want to know what colleges have programs in their areas of interest. It does cast a very wide net in what is essentially just a list database. But beyond that, not much substance. In our case, as we'd already narrowed to a dozen or so selective colleges, no new information here for us."
1,Worst College Guide Book,This is probably the most useless college guide book I have seen. Students seek a college educational experience that matches them. Their needs cannot be met by simple rankings of size by campus or selectivity by major.Where are descriptions by the author for each college in this book?
5,Rugg's Recommendations on the Colleges - 23rd Edition,"No pictures of students sitting on the grassy area in front of the ivy covered brick building. Plain and simple, who has the best major programs, period. Every colleges claims they have a fantastic math, art, etc... department. Rugg's is the book that gives you some idea of how good a certain major program is at a particular college. So if you are looking for a top physics program with a strong art program, you can find it. Ruggs is the go to book, it rates the major not the school's glossy brochure. Undecided? you can use Ruggs to find the schools that have strong programs in the 4 areas you are interested in so if your first major choice doesn't work out, you can change majors without having to change school. This book got us to our top 10 choices for schools based on area of interest."
3,Be aware: It's a book of lists,"I'm sure this book fills a useful niche, but I did not realize before purchasing it that there would be no discussion of the programs listed at the various colleges. It is a book of lists, pure and simple. A good jumping-off place, I'm sure, but it tells one nothing substantive (besides the basic info about location, etc.) about the schools and programs listed other than that they ""made the list."" It's a reference book to consult at the library or school counselor's office, not a book to invest in as a college-bound student or parent."
5,Ruggs Recommendations on the Colleges:24th edition,"This is the book my son's guidance counselor went to when he told her what he was interested in studying in college. We used the lists over and over when deciding where to look. It is a great cross reference guide. Finally, I decided to buy the book, which I will use in our next college search."
3,just okay,Great light for area work but too fragile. Knocked it over and bulb blew out. Replacement bulbs too expensive to warrent any value in light. Only recommend to be used for very light duty work
1,Not Sure - Doesn't work,Unfortunately my light does still not work after replacing the bulb. Now I don't know if that is a faulty bulb or something wrong with the light itself.
3,Perfect Replacement,This replaced the original bulb perfectly. I'll get another when the time comes. I wish the package lent itself to better protection.
3,Not exactly a mystery,"While I initially found this story entertaining, I have to argue that it really isn't a mystery at all. It's more of an illustration of the feminist politics of the characters. In other words, the killer is exactly who you expect it to be. I kept waiting for an entertaining twist and there was none. And even as a feminist, I found myself unable to swallow all the pronouncements of certain characters.Don't read this for the mystery. Read it, if at all, for the politics. They are the real reason for this novel's existence. And don't say you weren't warned."
4,Great counting book!,"This is a great story which teaches young children to count. You can't actually get to 100 by counting the shoes as some of them are hidden, but never-the-less my almost first grader enjoys the challenge!"
3,5 Star Expectations,"Sixty Five Dollars is a lot of money to spend on any book. My decision to buy this one was influenced by the many rave reviews and my desire to own the ""Ultimate"" SL resource book. Much of the book content was devoted to Gullwings and other collectables I couldn't afford to even think about. Medrcedes racing history also consumes many pages.One real dissapointment is the propensity of the author to sell many pages to service providers for commercial advertising and much plugging for the SL market Letter - another commercial venture apparently produced by the author. My 3 star rating is a stretch. My copy is being returned to Amazon to be replaced by something a little less ""ultimate""."
4,a must have book,"if you a fan of SL Mercedes, or if you own a SL this is the book for you i brought the book before i brought my SL 600 thanks to this book i got a great car , and now i own the car its a great referance book sure its alot of money on a book, but it saves thousands in the long run if you buy the car"
3,SL Book review,"The book was full of glossy pages, there was a lot of information on the most expensive SL (GullWings etc) not so much practical information on the the newer models from the 80 and 90. The watch out for what you are buying guide was only limited to general common sense, the book was informative but not worth the price, will there be a paper back addition?However I did read it in a week as I was interested in the subject, there was a lot of history in the book, I wanted a book that would be a buyers guide this has some of that but mainly the history of the SL and where you can drive it if you are a millionaire.The SL Experience: The Ultimate Mercedes-Benz SL Resource Book"
2,Innovative but rather poorly presented,"I'm a third year undergraduate mechanical engineering student and I bought this book as my supervisor sugested that I try to implement the concept of 6D spatial vectors into my research project. The book starts out fine, the ideas are sound but I'm having a rather hard time trying to make sense of it due to there being very little use of practical examples in the book and the examples that are in the book are not that well explained; I suspect engineering mathematics students might be able to benefit more from the book but as a mechanical student I find that I'm going to need a lot of assistance to understand the presented material."
5,A review for the reviewers,"After reading the reviews on this CD, I purchased it. My goodness, how much more I enjoyed each track after reading the descriptions of the songs. I don't know how you all know these stories, but THANK YOU for sharing them. My parents were musicians in an orchestra and when I started piano lessons, the first song I learned was ""Mack the Knife"". I was a little young when Bobby Darin passed away and am just now becoming acquainted with his music. This CD is so fun to listen to in the car, all alone. I love his banter...you feel like you're there. I first went to Las Vegas in 1974 when it was just a big town. The fun part after watching headliners, was to go sit in the lounge of whatever casino they were performing, and they would come out and sit and have a few drinks, often times right next to you. I did see Frank & Dean perform...never saw Bobby. Thanks again reviewers..."
5,WOW!,"Sit back, pretend you were in Las Vegas during its glory days, and listen to a master vocalist and his orchestra in total sync. After hearing this album, you'll throw away all your ""It's Vegas, Baby"" compilations. This album is truly Bobby Darin and Sin City at its best."
4,Tried and True,"Used product in my family for years. Used 2 ways. For preventive , I would give a spoonful at bedtime to my kids during the entire cold season. They either never or rarely got a cold. At the onset of a bronchial type cold works great 2-3 times a day. Did not seem to work as well for sinus type colds. Key to use to avoid a cold. My now adult children request me to find and ship for them when they can't find in their local store."
5,Father John's Does The Job!,"It's exactly like I remember it from when I was a child. I started taking it when I felt a cold coming on and it knocked it right out of me!. As for the taste... I think it's pretty good. Just make sure you shake it well each time to mix it up, or you might end up with too much cod liver oil on your spoon. Now that's nasty. I'm about to order some more Father J. Love it!"
3,Not the same cough suppressant of my youth,I went in search of this product when my son got a cold. I remember the pleasant taste and used to love to get it from my mother. This is not the same one. It appears that they added more cod liver oil and that is the taste that seems to stick with you. To help with the cough - I don't think it really does anything that the other brand of children cough syrup does. My son hates the taste and calls it his yucky medicine. We have come to the conclusion that if you take it off the spoon and hurry up and swallow it - it's not as bad.
3,Buy 6 and get only 1 colored.,"That is it. All the other 5 pairs are white. For this price, though, it's a nice deal."
5,Highly recommended,"This tea is from Yorkshire, UK, and is the best tea ever! One tea bag makes two perfect, delicious cups of tea. The tea I drink when I don't have Yorkshire Gold is a very poor substitute. This tea has a lovely golden colour, the flavor is incomparably better than any other tea, and has no papery taste as do so many tea bags. I'm delighted to be able to get this regularly now. The price is excellent and the free shipping an added bonus.Taylors of Harrogate, Yorkshire Gold Tea, 80-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 5)"
5,The best tea for your teapot,"On the Taylors of Harrogate Yorkshire Gold tea box it reads, ""The Best Tea for Your Teapot."" It is. And furthermore, since 1990 Taylors have planted over two million trees around the world, winning the Queen's coveted Award for Enterprise for Sustainable Development."" But most of all, their tea, blended for three generations for their family Bettys Tea Rooms in Yorkshire, England, does ensure that you can ""always be sure of getting the best cup of tea no matter where you live."" It's all on the package, and it's all true. Be careful to note that Yorkshire Gold and Yokshire are two different blends."
5,Best TEA by far,"There isn't another tea that satisfies me like Yorkshire Gold. Compare it with any other black tea and I'm sure you will agree. Be sure it is the ""gold"" not their ""red"" box."
5,An Excellent Black Tea from England,"Makes a lovely cup of tea. Note that it is not easily found in America, especially at a decent price. So, order it in quantity - you won't be disappointed!"
1,Stunned,"This ""BOOK"" isn't really a book after all. I wouldn't even consider it a paperback. It is really a pamphlet with only 20 pages. If I would have known how cheaply made it was I would have never paid what I did for it. And, the content is a very shallow look at the ""...history, structure, and community"" because it only contains 20 pages to cover everything. Very disappointed!"
3,Review,This book provides and excellent insight into Deaf culture and the proud rich history that created its present structure.
3,A pleasing film,"Although it may seem somewhat dry this film gives a pretty good idea what happened in the 1939 negotiations of the nazis, the soviets and the british."
5,"My family loves ""The Five Tales of Christmas""!",We thoroughly enjoy listening to these stories. My children started quoting some of them almost immediately; they were touched by the lessons taught and would often choose to listen to these poems rather than other Christmas music CDs. We look forward to hearing them through the entire Christmas season.
3,Palatable,"As a story, this did not hold anyones interest for very long. However, the use of food-- rice, as the common ground for families in this multicultural neighborhood, has an understanding appeal. Simple recipes make it an ideal tool to use at home as well as in the classroom."
2,"Great concept, sub-par execution","There is no real ""story"" to this book, except for the gimmicky premise that the protagonist's brother is loose and, given his reputation as a ""moocher"" (their word), she has to go find him by eating her way from one house to another. The idea of seeing what families of diverse backgrounds eat is a great one, and even more fun the idea that the staple food is a common one, but the plot is non-existent. Treat it more like a recipe book or a reference book, where each page is distinct, and you won't be so disappointed. Not very attractive illustrations."
3,Street Knight Review,"Jeff Speakman was one of the best martial arts actors during the 80's and 90's in terms of actual martial arts skills. Though he wasn't as popular as JCVD or Steven Seagal, he was a much better actual fighter. I saw him perform at a tournament in California back in 1993 - he was pretty awesome. Though not as good as the Perfect Weapon, it isn't bad and has a decent story. I'm not sure why none of his movies are on DVD."
4,lots of karate action,A very stupid plot that gets the message across that gangs can work together if the right things are done and common sense is used. One guy did do what he could and stop a plot that could have destroyed a lot of people but ended up bringing two worlds together.
5,Just about the best CD in my collection!!!,"This is one of the best CD's on the market. Fred Hammond has outdone himself. It is uplifting and the words really make you think about your own spiritual standpoint. Anyone would enjoy this CD. From my 16 month old niece to my 40+ mother, everyone enjoys this CD because it is anointed. Take it from this 15 year old teenager, it is literally the bomb!!!!!"
5,Phenomenal - The Best Fred Yet!!!,"This CD truly blessed my soul! It continues to bless me every time i listen to it - I enjoy it more and more. Fred has truly exalted his musical style, and I thank God for a brother like Fred. I encourage all those who love Gospel music to check this CD out!! It will bless you - I guarantee it!"
5,"i would have rated a ten, but, they only allowed five....","Well, Bro. Fred (and everyone else that has enjoyed him since Commissioned), what can I say? Out of 110 reviews you got two complaints.... isn't God beautiful??? Truely KNOW that you ARE blessed; I pray so EVERYTIME I listen to your music (especially this cd)continue to worship and exalt God as ANYONE who listens to your music is COMPELLED to do! Bro. Fred and RFC, you and your families be blessed of God!!!"
5,"TRUE GOSPEL MUSIC THAT ENCOURAGES, INSTRUCTS, AND COMFORTS!","I am a lover of true gospel music. I'm in love with this project. I remember when he was with Commissioned, which was a blessed group. But this project is his best work yet. You can't help but love this set because Fred uses today's music and technology to spread the Gospel. The direction gospel music is going is exciting and Brother Hammond is leading the way. Others are trying to do this, but they don't apply the Word of God. Everyone should listen to, if not purchase, this project. You will be blessed!"
5,This CD set stands alone !!!,"I HAVE BEEN A FRED HAMMOND FAN SINCE COMMISSIONED. HIS FIRST COUPLE OF ALBUMS WERE NICE. BUT PAGES OF LIFE? LET ME JUST PUT IT THIS WAY....I BOUGHT THE CD OVER A YEAR AGO. AND IT IS STILL IN MY CD CHANGER. EVERY SONG IS A MINISTRY. NO MATTER WHAT I'M GOING THOUGHT, THERE IS ALWAYS A PARTICULAR TRACK THAT IS MADE JUST FOR THAT SITUATION. I PRAY HE NEVER CHANGES AND CONTINUES TO PRODUCE MORE UPLIFTING MUSIC. MAY GOD BLESS FRED HAMMOND & RFC."
5,We're Blessed,"Let the praise begin, in all we say and do we must remember to put God first. Fred Hammond is not a stranger to this man, through his ministry I know many are saved and uplifted by his beautiful arrangements. My prayer is for God to keep you on the front of the enemy line for a long time, we are already victorious (no weapon formed against me shall prosper). And just a note to the other viewers, I feel if you can't say something positive about someone then say nothing at all...a thought after reading some of the other reviews. God Bless Fred."
5,FRED HAMMOND REALLY MINISTERS TO YOUR SOUL,"THIS DOUBLE CD REALLY MINISTERS TO EVERY ASPECT OF YOUR LIFE.IT REACHES THE YOUNG AND OLD,AND I THINK THAT IT IS A POWERFUL TOOL FOR THE SAVED AND THOSE LOOKING TO BE SAVED. EVERY SONG TOUCHES MY HEART AND ENCOURAGES ME TO WANT TO BUILD A CLOSER AND MORE INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE LORD. THIS IS AN AWESOME WORK OF GOD FROM A TRULY ANNOINTED MAN OF GOD! TO GOD BE THE GLORY FOR ALL THAT HE HAS DONE....."
5,Yours for the harvest,"This CD has been such a timely asset to our ministry for the Lord. ""No weapon"" is the song that prophetically spoke to our situation and caused us to press on in the fight believing God for the victory, and yeah He came through! We praise Jesus for providing anointed music ministers like brother Fred Hammond and Radical for Christ."
5,"This album shows us what real ""SOUL"" music is","There is not a single'weak'song on this album! Your gospel record collection and your record collection in general is sorely deficient without ""Pages of Life."" We are so grateful for this seemless blend of contemporary styles with melody, harmony and Message. I am also encouraged by this bold step of producing a double album yet only charging the regular single price. Thank you Fred and co. for sowing. INCREDIBLE ALBUM, INCREDIBLE MUSIC, INCREDIBLE POETRY (especially, my favourite ""You Called Me Friend""), INCREDIBLE TRUTH, INCREDIBLE MINISTERS, INCREDIBLE GIFTS. If you decide to only buy 1 album this year this must be it! It is a total upliftment with substance. Trust me, you'll wake up singing the songs on this album."
5,I NEVER GET TIRED OF LISTENING TO THE CD,MY HUSBAND AND I LISTEN TO THE CD ALL THE TIME. EACH SONG IS VERY UPLIFTING. WE ARE LOYAL FANS OF FRED HAMMOND. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!!!
5,THE ULTIMATE MASTERPIECE,Fred Hammond is the most anointed man in gospel industry. You can feel the anointing of God flowing on this CD. Fred really knows how to minister. I pray that the Lord continues to bless Fred and R.F.C. I am looking forward to the next CD.
3,This album was a dissappointment.,"If you enjoyed his albums, ""I am Persuaded"" and ""Spirit of David"" this album will be a disapointment to you. The vocals are tiresome in repetitiveness. The music is fine but these two cd's pale in comparison to his previous vocal arrangements."
1,Very Disappointed,"This album would have been better if everything on it was new. Also, you could have had a bit more polished recording. I hope that you improve for the next album. Thank you."
4,Truly Inspiring!,"I was disappointed with some of the audio but the songs and messages made it all worthwhile. My best friend recommended this CD to me and as I have already told him, it was great!I recommend this CD but just remember that you may have to make some adjustments for some of the audio."
5,A True Blessing - Pages of Life CD set & Fred Hammond w/ RFC,"I purchased the Pages of Life CD set 2 years ago while I was in Minneapolis doing some job training and let me tell you, Pages of Life got me through what was definitely a difficult time in my life. Fred Hammond is truly a minister for Christ and Radical for Christ, while is only composed of a few members, possesses the ability to come across as a 100-plus member choir. My favorite songs on the album are No Way...You will Lose and Jesus is All. Trust me, the later brings me to tears each time I hear it. This CD set is worth ANY amount of money required to purchase it. You will be TREMENDOUSLY BLESSED by Pages of Life. Allow Fred Hammond and RFC to anoint your life with this beautiful and uplifting gift of music."
5,Just gets better!,I never tire of the smooth flow of his ideas. From the jump tunes to beautiful ballads he is GOOD!
4,Long overdue collection,"No jokes, please : This is excellent easy-listening/lounge music. This CD collects some very good material sung in her trademark light, breathy style set against tasteful, attractive arrangements. Nice booklet and photos as well. It's a shame A&M won't license more of her material (only four tracks are from A&M where she did her best albums), but what's here is very good. An import, ""Digital Remastered Best"", contains A&M material and is highly recommended, as are most of her import CDs, although you have to be independently wealthy to afford most of them."
4,Highly recommended,"Although it includes only four tracks from her A&M days (her best period, but A&M is stingy with licensing), this is still a fine collection, not withstanding that it's the only US collection available. Good booklet, too. The import, ""Digitally Remastered Best"", is the recommended choice for Longet collectors, but this is nevertheless well recommended and nicely priced."
2,"Viva La Longet! - but, sadly, not here","There's an undeniable magic when Claudine Longet has her way with an arrangement by Nick DeCaro. It's four parts camp to one part brilliance, and it can really hook you if you keep an open mind. This collection, however, is not a best-of or even the place to start. Get Claudine's ""Love is Blue"" album which has most of her all-time greats - Randy Newman's ""Snow,"" ""Small Talk,"" ""Happy Talk,"" a hysterical ""Falling In Love Again,"" the Bee Gee's ""Holiday"" (you have to hear it!) and - I swear to God - a love song to a seal. There's never been anything quite like her...."
3,Longet outing has hits and misses,"If you're interested in buying this CD one would imagine that you know a little bit about Claudine Longet's singing voice--or lack thereof. This was her style and people craved it and for those whose craving is still untamed here is an easily accessible disc featuring 16 whispered selections by Longet. Despite her small voice, Longet does well even with big splashy arrangements, though some are too loud and make Longet's voice difficult to her. Her covers of the Carpenters' classics, a Beach Boys' tune and John Lennon's ""Hear, There and Everywhere"" are well done, but she is completely off the mark with ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough,"" sung in French and Buffy Sainte Marie's ""Guess Who I Saw in Paris."" It's unfortunate that some of Longet's other covers, ""The Look of Love,"" and her Jobim outings from earlier albums are missing from this disc, which would make all the more worthwhile owning."
5,Haunting chaunteuse finally gets her due!,"Though nowhere near complete (where's ""Snow""?), this compilation of music from my very favorite A&M recording star is a must for fans. Claudine's haunting vocals (delivered in a whispery French accent) were truly ahead of their time. This is 60's easy listening at its best. Magical."
4,Jeffersons review,"The Jeffersons is a classic old school sitcom, that will leave anyone in stitches even up to this very day. Life is never boring in the home of the Jeffersons as they battle daily with a variety of challenges and societal issues ranging from race to pride. Any Jefferson seasonal dvd is a classic and stands among the greats like ""Goodtimes"" and ""What's happening""."
3,"Misleading, but Serendipitously Educational","When I bought ""The Jeffersons"" I assumed it would be a dissertation upon the echoes of Jeffersonian politics throughout the annals of American history. While I was nonetheless disappointed when I realized what I had bought had nothing to do with the aforementioned, I found a pleasant, serendipitous surprise in watching the actual show. The characters are rich, vibrant, and most importantly, black. I had never actually encountered a black person in my lifespan thus far, but this series of short documentaries seems to be an accurate representation of what the lives of black folk are like.Let freedom ring!"
5,I got this game for someone else and they seemed to like it..they read it very quickly so I got them a new game,I got this game for someone else and they seemed to like it..they read it very quickly so I got them a new game
2,Unable to read,I was looking forward to this book - the reviews were positive and the premise was right up my alley. However the formatting of the Kindle edition made it impossible to read. I'm disappointed to miss this one.....
4,A Book of Kells,"A Book Of Kells brought me back in time to when people were more concerned about God, country, and family than they are today. I often thought what was life was like back then for people working in the spread of Christianity. Well, this book does a very good job of explaining what it was like. The dedication of the people is amazing!A book about real people, in real life situations makes for real interesting reading!I loved this book!"
2,Very basic,"This book is written only for the very basic beginner in IT. If you have been around an IT department for any length of time, you will find it difficult to pick up any new management thoughts in this book. For example, the entire topic of ERP systems is covered in 2 pages."
3,Learned nothing,"I am a Systems Administrator by trade and have been given the reins ofa 12 person tech staff including Network, Systems and DatabaseAdministrators and Web Developers in an ASP for Telecom. I need helpwith the management aspect of this job, not help choosing my laptopcomputer or the classic pitches that we geeks are used to giving tonon technical people about backups and network security (ie: How muchdowntime can you afford ?)This book might be aimed to another kindof person than I. It might be aimed at a manager that is new to IT,but this book is very light on content for a person who is seasoned inIT but new to management.I walked out of the book store with""Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams"" and""Creating High Performance Software DeleopmentTeams""... Even though we are do not do development it seemed toapply. I enjoyed my last Amazon purchase, ""The Mythical ManMonth"", very much."
3,So very basic :(,This book does not even explain what a manager is supposed to do. Every single topic in this book is covered so quickly and with so little detail that the book is contains little more than common sense.
3,Helpful to a Point,"This was a basic read, for thse already into the methodology explained throught the book. Would be a useful tool for someone just starting out. I would recommend expanding on the disaster recovery portion, and possibly adding a section on managing in the non-profit arena."
4,"Not quite as good as ""Why Catholics Can't Sing""","In this follow-up, Day branches out from music criticism into the fields of church ""renewal"" and comparisons between the ole Latin Mass and the new vernacular Mass. It's not quite up to his other work. His writing style is a bit harder to follow and his points are more scattered. Sometimes he sounds like a union organizer for an organist guild. But it still is worth reading and he makes some extremely valid points. Everybody who is discontented with the state of Catholic worship should read this book and would probably agree with about 90% of it."
4,Nice clutter hideaway,"Not fine furniture. That said, this small pedestal is a great place to tuck away NetFlix movies and all the DVDs that always seem to accumulate around the television. It looks great with a plant on top and would also be a good place to set a drink if it were next to a chair. The best thing about it though, is that it came completely assembled."
5,"Straightforward and easy to use, but lacked on the interpretation details",I'm a fan of these sorts of texts having found the Essentials of the WAIS-III a great resource I keep returning too. I imagine it will be the same with this text as I found it really easy to use and easy to read. Perhaps my only complaint is that there is little discussion about interpretation. Otherwise a great resource in scoring up your WISC-IV.
4,Helpful!,You have to be practicing the assessment at same time as reading this to make it effective. The quizzes at the en of the chapters helped me to self check and the format was great for visual leathers.
5,Great Job,The book came really fast and that was great because I needed it before I moved to a different state for school!
2,This is what happens when an author gets an agenda,"Butler had an agenda with this book. He had the story planned out from beginning to end and he would not deviate. As i read this book i kept feeling the story moving out of line, like there was something else that needed to be told, there was more to this story. But then Butler would rench it back in by bringing up that infernal question. Other reviewers have spoiled the ""surprise"" but I wont. To me, the question didnt matter. The man's need to know seemed forced, almost unreasonable. And certainly the ending didnt necessarily have to end that way. Simply because he was recognized doesnt mean he was responsible. But, as i said, Butler had an agenda with this book. It was a story he told his way, regardless of how the story itself wanted to go. And so we end up with an endearing Vietnamese girl, an almost endearing American man who asks strange questions, and a story that limps from being beat into line too often. Skip it."
3,evocative of a foreign time and place,"This is the first book I've read of his -- it sounds like it's worth checking out his Pulizter prize winning stories. Butler does an excellent job of evoking the sights and smells of Vietnam from the perspective of a vet who returns to find out more about himself. The narrative flows from Ben's point of view to his lover's -- the technique seemed heavy handed at times, seamless at others. Images flow freely as they fall in love and try to consummate their passion -- but the past's secrets seem to be invading. The conclusion seems too much to be believed, but I'm not sure it matters that much. This is a mood novel, and as such, it was a good read. You'll feel like you know what it feels like to be in Vietnam under this time and circumstance. Very nicely done overall with some well-drawn portraits of two characters."
4,How did he make this believable?,"In this book, I knew almost from the beginning what the end of the story would be, but I couldn't put it down because I was dying to know what the character's reactions would be. Although it seems like the characters do nothing but have sex or think about having sex, Butler takes an unthinkable situation and somehow makes it believable."
4,My dogs love them but they are huge for small dogs.,"These treats look and smell like they could be enjoyed by anyone, including people! And my dogs just ate them with relish. My only reason for rating them 4 instead of 5 is because the size is huge for my little 10 pound buddies. Also, the pieces aren't a consistent size. Some are very large while some are half the size of others. Although it appears some have broken in the box, the majority are quite think and I doubt I can easily break the larger ones in half should I choose to do so to try and get a more reasonable size for my dogs. Of course, they aren't complaining about the bigger size!"
1,Stale,The entire box of treats was so hard I had to hit them with a hammer to break them small enough for my 60 lb dog to eat.
5,My dogs love them,"I have ordered Blue Dog Bakery Biscuits for years. You can get them in low fat, they are natural and my dogs love them."
5,Turns your dog BLUE with Happiness!!!!!,We found these at our local Haggen's. Our three dogs LOVE LOVE LOVE these cookies. I couldn't find the little ones at the grocery so I bought the big cookies. They are huge. I've ordered the little ones. Your dog will go nuts for these.
5,Great Healthy Treat,"My dog loves these cookies. We give one to her for desert after she eats her dog food; if we forget, she reminds us. I really like giving healthy treats with no additives or preservatives. Also love the fact that they are low-fat."
5,Blue dog cookies,Blue dog cookies have a good taste they clean teeth &are low fat so please try them for your dog.
5,Yummy!,My dogs love these treats! My big dog gets the large treats and my smaller dog gets the smaller treats...all in one box!
5,My dogs love them,I feel good about giving my fur babies treats that don't have all kinds of artificial junk in them when possible. This is a guilt free treat.
5,My dogs love them!,My dogs love these biscuits; they are the best! Even my finicky dog loves them! Great value; best to buy by the case.
4,Blue Dog treats,"My two dogs, a corgi and a terrier-dachshund mix, adore these, but I have to try to break them in half to suit the size of my dogs. I wish they came in a pack of all small cookies, but that's not a really big problem. These are thicker and harder than the All Star Blue Dog treats I wasn't able to get via Amazon the last time we needed some treats. That factor does give the dogs a bit more chewing time, which they enjoy."
2,couldn't find them in store,My dog loves these treats and they smell so good! I've tried three different stores and can't find them anywhere. Too bad no one from the Marketing Dept. reads these reviews; maybe they would start carrying them again. I'm very disappointed I can no longer buy these treats.
5,The BEST customer service ever,"I could not find my Romeo's favorite dog biscuits in the local stores anymore. Luckily I had an almost empty box and found the toll free number to the company. I was amazed at the friendliness of the girls I spoke to. THANKS TO BLUE DOG BAKERY and your wonderful customer servie, my dog now gets his biscuits by the case. 5***** and paw prints to Blue Dog. Barb Ross (and Romeo)"
1,spilled toner all over our copier,"spilled toner all over our copier, we have a al-1540cs. In short, copier is ruined, the toner is too fine to clean off the parts. We have tried to clean the copier, inserted the toner back in (made sure it was seated correctly) it still spilled all over the place. Not sure what is wrong here but this product is not recommended."
5,Esta obra de consulta es excelente,"Nítida y concisa, con cobertura amplia, esta gramática merece un lugar en su estante si Ud. es un hispanohablante o no."
3,Works Great,"I always liked Panasonic products and needed a corded phone for emergency purposes, power outages, this does what I need it to do. I don't care to much for having batteries in it, but who uses a home phone anymore anyway?"
4,Panasonic - Not too ahead of our times on this one!,This phone needs to do about what I needed it to do. I only bought it cause I needed a wired phone to use in conjunction with my wireless headset. It works ok.
2,Nothing impressive,"The cord for the phone is quite short so you need to be very close to the phone to use it. It feels very cheaply made, but if you just want a very simple phone this will probably do it for you.The sound quality was not great."
2,Don't buy the head set extension,"Got this phone for my office, thought this was a good, reliable phone. I thought that all office phones had an extension plug for a headset... wrong. I even read the first page of reviews and people were satisfied overall. Another problem is that I hear a slight echo of myself during conversations. Very annoying. Returning it for something a better."
2,The headset does not hook up easily and stay on th phone securely,Inside the board should have had a soft material laminated to the wood finish. The box should have also had a carrying handle.
2,no cords included,"Buyers of this phone ought to know that it comes WITHOUT ANY WIRES WHATSOEVER,in spite of the onein the picture.DISHONESTY!"
2,Oakland Reader,"Didn't like it, didn't use it, to expensive to return. No speaker phone feature. It will go out for sale at our next garage sale"
1,Should not be offered with headset...,"I was in a rush and needed a corded phone ASAP that was headset compatible. I skimmed thru the info and assumed (stupidly) that since the product was offered at a discount with the panasonic headset, that the phone was headset compatible. Well, it wasn't. Not only that, but the ringer on it is oddly annoying. If you are in need of a cheap phone, this is okay. However, you'd be better off getting something better for only a few dollars more!"
2,stock up on batteries,"As a basic, one-line, corded phone, this is adequate. The sound quality is good, and the instruction booklet is well written. But the keypad has an annoyingly stiff touch, and the caller ID screen is not easy to read in most kinds of light. The instructions say it needs three new alkaline batteries every six months; in my experience, it's every two months."
3,Decent Corded Phone,"This is a decent corded phone with good sound quality. We bought it for use as a wall phone, and the construction doesn't really warrant that use. It can hang on the wall but doesn't look great. Also, the caller ID screen is very dark and difficult to read. But, as I said, for the cost, it's a decent phone without the bells and whistles you sometimes don't want but get stuck having to get."
4,Ok Phone,"I was looking for replacement wall phone and did not want to invest a great deal of money in the product. I did want memory dial if possible, speaker would have been nice. My only problem with this phone as a wall phone has been that it sometimes does not connect when hung up and one has to jiggle it into position. It would be fine as a desk phone."
2,Don't waste your money on this one....,"If you are planning to mount this phone on the standard old fashioned phone jack, good luck. First the attaching chord to plug it in is way too long, and no place to wind it up to. The mount is also just one point, and doesn't fit real well. Very unstable when you try using the phone. The price should tell you something as it is made very cheap. The chord for the hand-set is also way to short. Will be stretched beyond recommendations unless you stand right next to to the phone. I packaged mine back up and giving it to Goodwill."
5,It's just what I expected,"This is just what is advertised: a lightweight, corded, one-line desk phone with caller ID and nice big buttons. It's attractive. Like any other purchase, batteries are not included."
1,Not quite as pictured,"The ad when I purchased the phone leads you to believe that it has a jack for a headset, but it does not. I returned the product. Which, by the way, Amazon made it so easy to return I will definitely continue buying from Amazon. Every purchase I have made through Amazon has been great, even if the product did not work out."
2,Phone,"I am very disappointed in this phone. For instance, to retrieve a phone number from your personal list, you have to press the big button to the left and then down and go through the whole list to get to the number you want."
5,Great book and in great condition,"The contents of the book will be of great support and reference for urban planning master of my wife, the edition is collectible and is in excellent condition."
3,Decent Study of Gentrification,"As an empirical study of gentrification this book is excellent; however, I must note that it is also another revision of traditional liberal ideology garbed in Marxian language. This makes the author's arguments rather weak because they too often call on the state to intervene in a process that it has purposefully made."
2,"5, 4, 3, 2, 1 monotony, yet great for days before the flu","Lots of bad things to share but know this: this workout is great for those low key days when your feeling the flu bug, the not so extreme flu bug that is. But, the sane person should opt for rest and water. Kindhearted control struggles exist between Sugar Ray and Jill Goodacre as giggling denotes it. Jill is incredibly monotone in her count downs and unenthusiastic but is in great shape-this in itself might motivate you. Cues are lacking; bad for the beginner and great for the expert who watches this again and again. And, the camera person lacks experience in fitness productions. The workout is slow-paced, flows enough and Sugar Ray is fun. It's okay-fine to borrow from the public library."
1,A Real Yawn-er with Bad Instructors,"I was excited to try Boxout and thought it would be a great workout. I was sadly disappointed. Jill Goodacre and Sugar Ray Leonard don't compliment each other at all, but instead struggle over control of the workout. The video seems as if it was taped without much preparation or previous experience leading a workout (there are a lot of mistakes). Jill Goodacre has a serious problem with rhythm and counting which gets very annoying throughout the workout. Some of the moves are fun, but the overall workout is pretty boring and not very challenging. I would stronly recommend looking elsewhere for a good boxing workout."
4,A must-have for holiday gatherings,Very fun arrangements of holiday favorites and I like Aldo's selections. I enjoyed listening to the CD in the car and mixed it in with my background music at a family gathering over the holidays. I especially like his very different arrangement of We Three Kings.
3,Is it history or historical fiction?,"As the reviewer from the Atlantic Monthly points out, this book is half history, half historical fiction. This gave me a fundamental problem in getting into the book. The first half is decently written and attempts to get in the heads of various Irish monks in the Middle Ages, the second half provides the facts to back up the conjecture of the first. I preferred the second half, though that may be because I tend to enjoy my history a bit harder than most. I just didn't like the structure of the book. To me, what this book really is is a novella about an Irish Monastery on a rocky island with a novella-sized end note section. The end notes were more relevant for research. I don't question the scholarship of the work, just the presentation. Overall, not bad, but if you can get past the strange way it's put together (unlike me) you'll probably enjoy it."
4,Life on the rock,"Skellig Michael (Michael's Rock) is a tiny, steep, pinnacle of an island off the coast of Ireland. For 600 years during the early middle ages, it served as a Celtic Monastery. Travel writer Geoffrey Moorhouse tells of the rigors of the isolated lives of the monks, via an imaginative, partly fictional reconstruction of key experiences such as surviving Viking raids, existence in a bare stone beehive hut, and preserving the essence of Celtic Christianity, away from the tentacles of Rome.The second half of the book is more scholarly but drier and less engaging. Nevertheless, Skellig Michael by its remoteness has remained relatively unchanged, and the evidence that researchers have been gathering from it has been aptly elucidated by Moorhouse; a valuable snapshot of Christianity in one of its variant early forms."
3,entertaining and illuminating,"Fun for anyone with even slight interest in history, Christian religion, etc. Part story, part historical text, very clever and interesting. I got bored about halfway through, which is why I didn't give this book a better rating, but I did finish it later and I thoroughly enjoyed it."
3,Worth Reading,"All Irish Catholics who identify ""Charming Billy"" as the best example of their heratage should read this book."
1,Great if You Want to Seriously Overcook Your Pasta!,OK...picked this up for three bucks at a super market. The pasta was already cooked and this thing barely began to register. Tried it a few times and it was way off each time. The directions are idiot-proof so it was nothing we were doing wrong. The best way to check for pasta is the time-tested method of tasting it yourself. If you rely on this then you'll be serving up a gooey mush for dinner.
2,Not clear,I was very disappointed in this book. It is difficult to understand and I am Catholic and Native American. Stay away from this one.
5,"Great CD, great band","Nice combination of ambient static sounds and hardcore metal. In comparison to El Diablo, the album as a whole isn't as good, but the songs themselves have more distinct personalities. You've got the ultra-intense ""Jaworski,"" the epics ""Slopez"" and ""Migual Abburido,"" and the more accessable songs ""Fresno"" and ""If She Could Speak."" In addition, there's the strange remix of ""I've Seen My Fate"" and ""Sign Off,"" a bizzare track involving two minutes of radio static and a bad recording of a high school marching band playing ""The Star Spangled Banner."" Oh yeah, and the songs that I didn't mention are great as well. If you like the Deftones, Far, Neurosis, or even The Dillinger Escape Plan, you will love this CD. It may take a while to grow on you, but once it does, you'll never want to stop listening to it.God, Will Haven is awesome!"
5,Sacto Emocore at its best.....(besides deftones)...,"Well lets see...i dont know how to start this, Will Haven is about all i expected, and more! If you like the heavy sounds the Deftones produce, this may be a good cd for you. I bought this cd with very little knowledge of Will Haven, and having only heard one song...but i am glad i bought it. If you like Far, Glassjaw, or Deftones, you should check this band out, they are really good, you decide whether or not you want to purchase the cd, but i strongly reccomend you do."
4,will they be to your liking?,the band combines the most hectic moments of the deftones with a hardcore crust and intersperce melody with chaos to create a unique hybrid of a band. i recommend this release to fans of all heavy music genres
1,Tea Box,Not too happy with this product. I gave it to someone for a present and when they opened it the hinges were stripped and falling off. Very disappointed in the quality. Wished I had not ordered it so early so I could have returned it.
5,Awakening the Leader Within,"It was phenomenal! I read it in one sitting. It was engrossing, thought-provoking and a very compelling look at business values. I would love to see a series of such books on a variety of specific topics. The fictional character interwoven with relevant teachings is a format that needs to continue."
3,"Accurate, but not new to me","I've read a lot of books on self-improvement and spirituality/awakening, so there was no new information in this book for me. However, his information is accurate and true.I didn't find the writing all that engaging.Stephen Covey's books (Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, etc) were more appealing to me.If you don't usually read spiritual/self-help books, and you are into leadership and improving your ability to lead, this might be your book.Personally, I am not keeping it."
5,The Title Says It All,"If you have any doubts about this wonderful book, two minutes of just browsing through the pages will convince you: this is the real thing, honest and straightforward. It's a magical gem just waiting to be discovered ~ take a look!"
4,Good overall handling of subject,"This book handles the issues associated with new product introduction very well. Most books on the subject concentrate on either the product designing aspects or the market orientations. This books brings forth the impact and importance of market conditions on the development of a new product very succinctly. It begins by looking at the product development cycle and then leads the reader through the various steps from product design through associated supply-chain management issues to present an overall picture. Appropriately placed illustrative examples and well depicted system diagrams along with graphical display of results increase the utility of the book for both, the in-depth researcher as also the casual reader."
3,"Cute, but disappointing","These shoes are as cute in person as they are on the internet. However, they are not wearing well. After only wearing them only three times the ladybug is coming off the front. Also, my daughter walked through some damp grass and they turned her socks pink. I feel the shoes are over priced for the quality of the shoe."
5,old school flava,"this album has the heart and message of any roots record from the 70's.the music is played on real instuments to give shedrocks words the right backing.i hung out with his drummer last year in jamacia (mikey speckels) and he gave me a copy of the new record-look for it soon ""test rastafari"".shedrock is rasta from creation!"
5,REAL REGGAE,THIS IS THE REAL DEAL. NO LOOPS OR PROGRAMMED INSTUMENTS.A MESSAGE AND ALSO ENTERTAINING.THIS IS THE NEXT THING TO BE BIG IN REGGAE.
3,Nice but latches don't work,"This is a nice large litter box with a large opening which I needed due to having large cats! It is quite sturdy, but only 2 of the 4 latches work and those work with difficulty, needing a lot of force to get them to latch. I had a problem with my previous box with the latches and was hoping this one would be better. The scoop and bags that come with this are kind of a joke, very flimsy. I will keep it because it is a pain sending it back, but I am unhappy about the latches."
4,I like this litter box & would buy another one,"I like this litter box. I've had it for 2 years. I have small cats (one 7 pounds and one is kitten that's about 4 pounds). They both can fit in there together. There's a lot of space when one cat is in it.I don't use the clasps that keep the box down since my cats have never actually knocked over the blue hood. The poop scooper looks kind of small. I've never used that either since I had my own poop scooper that I like. And the thing on the top that's suppose to handle the smell, I *think* it worked in the beginning, but never actually bothered to replace it. In fact, I took it off eventually.All in all, this box has worked well for me and I would buy this item again."
4,Very easy to do exercise,I bought this exercise DVD for my aged mother. The exercise is easy for aged people. I would recommend this for people who want an easy exercise routing. You can easily do it in a 6 by 6 space.
2,Disappointing,"I've heard great things about this video, so I got it wanting to like it. I was quite disappointed. Fitness instructor Petra Kolber teaches and leads alongside George Foreman, who makes the odd comment while they and a class of participants do the workout. The music is loud (too jarring for me) and Petra isn't my favourite instructor, she's very rah rah and hyper. Maybe because I found all that annoying, I couldn't bring myself to finish the workout, but I was also bored. I've done other simple marching/walking type workouts with basic easy to follow moves which I much preferred, for example ""Kathie Lee's Feel Fit & Fabulous"" - you don't have to be a Kathie Lee fan for that one (I'm not) but the instructor C.B. Yelverton is wonderful and I love the routine. Sorry George, I love your grill but this workout is going to be donated to Goodwill."
2,Buyer Beware,"1/4"" broke the first day. The mechanism is substandard and typical of these Chinese Knock off tools. The 3/8"" is still working but I am unsure for how long."
5,The Queen of Salsa.,"Cuban-born Celia Cruz is rightly known as the Queen of Salsa. In our democratic society, we think that such an exalted position is something you grow into over time, something you achieve after years of effort and persistence. But musical royalty is similar to political royalty in that most true kings and queens are born, not made. Elvis's ""That's All Right"" notwithstanding, ""Cao Cao Mani Picao"" is the best proof of that unfair fact of life: it was Celia's first single, and she sounds as regal and assured as she does fifty years on. Me, if I were a subject of Celialand, I'd be quite content to chime in the backing cao-caos with the other peons. At least I'd be in the presence of greatness."
5,repurposing free emails and selling it back to me,"Wow. Wow. Rageboy's ways are faster than America realizes. Blessed by more than a wit of words, Rageboy (AKA Chris Locke) steps three ahead in the market place. Who else would approach this strategy? Who else could get away with it?!? My prose aren't as jumpy as Locke's when it comes to surrounding your eyes and swirling your brain to confusion and delusion, so stop reading this review and read the book NOW!!!...So yeah, buy Chris' book and read it NOW...Laterz/Billy"
2,Disappointing for general crafts perhaps OK for papermakers.,"This title was included in a Carol Duval show recently and sounded like a good purchase for general craft use. It wasn't. First, it's over a decade old and hasn't been updated. So many things have changed since this was written that much of what they say is now irrelevant particularly in the technology area. Second, it's written by an English couple which means those of us in the States have to convert many examples as we go. There are a large number of black and white sample designs at the back of the book which could be useful to some. Also for those involved in papermaking and decorating paper it has some useful information. However, OVERALL it's really outdated and not a smart buy for the general crafter."
3,"Acceptable, but overall disappointing","This book does not live up to expectations. Found that many of the photos are poor quality/amateur in nature. Some cellars displayed are spectacular but many are ho-hum. Nor does the book have any substantive material. Simple text descriptions accompany photos but only so much can be learned by looking at pictures. I agree with other reviews that this is a good coffee table or ""idea"" book. However, I expected more interesting photos with meaningful descriptions of the space, conditions, materials, lighting, etc... If you have to have it buy it used.A much better book is: The Home Wine Cellar: A Complete Guide To Design And Construction by Perry Sims. While it doesn't have as many photos, those it does have are more inspiring and accompanied by good information on cellar design and construction."
1,Some effects nothing more,"Well, the trailer was great; unfortunately the trailer contained all the good stuff the movie had. Some effects are good, but plot is weak and has no connections to ""Dungeons & Dragons"" whatsoever. I would recommend fantasy fans see it when it would be available for rent. Don't make the same error I made; don't waste your money to see it in theaters or to buy it."
1,Crappity Crap,"This movie is perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen. I doesn't remain true to the Roleplaying game it is based off of, the acting is terrible, an d the story is bland and uninteresting. The special effects are alright, but you can't get past the TERRIBLE acting seen in this movie. This is Gigli times 2."
1,I really tried!,"I really tried to watch this movie from beginning to end. For the fun of it. Really! I tried! It's bad. Bad, bad, bad! Not ""laughably bad"" or ""so bad it was good"". It's BAD! It doesn't even inspire Mystery Science Theater 3000 jokes at 3 a.m. after drinking to much Mountain Dew. Borrow it if you must, but don't waste a free rental ...on it"
1,Just Dragons,"This film had alot of dragons, but was seriously lacking in dungeons. I don't know about you, but I like alot of dungeon action."
2,"Awwww, this could of been a lot better!!!","I'm a big fan of medival movies and monster flicks, but this one fell short. Why? Because the graphics weren't that good, the acting was very lousey and the characters weren't believable. The good things about this movie were that they had some good ideas that looked good and it was sort of fun watching what was going on. I really could bash this movie and say how this sucked or how they could of done this better , but I'm not. In a way it's sort of a good kids movie that does has some violent seens that aren't particularly good for younger children. But it's a decent attempt. BUT RENT IT AND SEE WHAT YOU THINK OF IT."
3,Who Cares What Other People Think,"If you are really intreasted in my opinion than read on:Their isn't anything really wrong with this movie. It is a very creative story with lots of imagination and adventure. I don't exactly understand why the evil henchman keeps eating blue popsicles, not that we see him doing that mind. I also confess that I do not understand the ending of the story. Thankgoodness however for those of us who aren't creative enough to get it, their is an alternative ending. Maybe they should start a contest to find out if anyone understood it. Well, now I'm making fun of it. Actually I'm not a very good judge, but I don't think their are very many people who are. So, If you're intreasted enough to read this, than I suggest that you find out for yourself!P.S. - I'd give this movie a 5 for creativity, but I'm giving it a 3 so that I don't look stupid next to the other reviews!"
4,"4 and a half stars, is what I really give it.","I can't believe people trying to convince other people not to see this. People should at least give it a chance. So the score isn't anything special. I still find myself humming it sometimes. The Visual Effects are pretty good. Especially the beginning going over the water and bridges to the dungeon. The dragons look awesome. If you can imagine how popular dragons and unicorns are today. The city looks cool too. Although some of the buildings do kind of look like something George Lucas scrapped from episode one. The special effects are neat none the less. If you have seen ""Neverending Story"", you'll know just how much Thora Birch is made up to look like an older version of the ""Childilike Empress"". So at least give this a chance. I want to get it on DVD. It is fun."
2,Would have been better had they not called it DnD,Basically I'm a fan of B-Movie fantasy films as well as a long time DnD player. I can say that the movie by itself is really not that bad and I'd easily say that its not the worst B-Grade fantasy film ever made. However as a DnD movie it blows. I'll never understand the need of filmakers to make a film based on something with a strong fan base and then change everything that the fans love about the subject. I can fully understand the need to change some things. This is a movie and unlike some purists I understand it is a different medium and sometimes things just have to be different. However this film bore almost NO resemblance to DnD. Fortunately when the sequel (Wrath of the Dragon God) was made this was fixed.Basically a good movie just not a good dnd movie. If you can get over that fact go ahead and watch it for the somewhat ok B fantasy movie that it is.
1,Dungeons & Dragons review,"Everything about this film is 100%,totally,super WRONG. The casting,the story,the effects and the writing are all [bleep] WRONG!!!!! The acting is stupid and chessy. The story make no sense even for a film called ""Dungeons & Dragons"" We also see very little dungeons and dragons. The setting looks like they got it on loan from A Kid in King Arthur's Count. The ending is super confusing at best. Its like watching A WCW Pay-Per-View from 2000(The same year this movie was made) I give this [bleep] a [bleep] 0 out of 10."
4,"So bad, its good","The reason for 4 stars is because it is a good laugh.It is a BAD movie. A heck of a lot of the acting is awful (the empress mostly), the scenes are hokey, the plot is generally predictable, and sometimes it flows poorly.I enjoy watching it however. I own the movie, and it is perfect when I need comedy. It is still a pretty classic ""oh no evil wizard, lets save the empire!"" story, and it has humorous lines. The rogues are entertaining, and who doesn't like watching a drunken dwarf fail to ride a horse? The mage is fairly whiny, but that's expected of a spoiled brat.The dragon animation is decent (for the time) and I always enjoy the end with the dragon um... having a little snack... at the end.It is a cheap movie, but worth it for that price. Don't expect a lot, and you'll get plenty. Expect too much, and you'll be disappointed."
2,D & D,I thought this movie based on the game wasn't satisfying and left much to be desired. Even the most grizzled D & D vet will have a hard time sitting throught the mediocrity of this picture. The animated Dragons of Autumn Twilight was considerably better.
1,Can i give this negative points?,"I'm going to make this review short for you who don't want to read a long one: This movie is a disgrace, it has a poorly developed stroy along with characters, and the sets are very blah and boring. I am a huge fan of fantasy/sci- fi movies, but this.... Terrible acting, terrible everything. DONT'T SEE!"
4,Get over it!,C'mon people - its eye candy and its a fun ride! I've played D&D for almost ten years now and even I liked the movie. Was there problems? Yeah. Was it kinda hokey? Yeah. Take a look at your gaming group... yeah... thought so.Sit back and enjoy it for what it is.. a fun and brainless way to spend some time watching a movie. This is your fix until Lord of the Rings comes out - make it count.
1,I really tried...,"I really tried to watch this movie from beginning to end. For the fun of it. Really! I tried! It's bad. Bad, bad, bad! Not ""laughably bad"" or ""so bad it was good"". It's BAD! It doesn't even inspire Mystery Science Theater 3000 jokes at 3 a.m. after drinking to much Mountain Dew. Borrow it if you must, but don't waste a free rental on this one."
4,There was no Dungeons or Dragons!,"I think that it was a good film, but maybe a bit more dungeons and a bit more dragons would have made it better.It was a good watch and cool adventure. I wouldn't buy it ( I got it from the video rental ) but I'd watch it again if anyone gave me the chance.I think that Dungeons and Dragons was a bit too much like Lord of the Rings and that LOTR kind of took over the fantasy of Dungeons and Dragons. I would recomend it as a Saturday evening kind of film."
3,"Ok movie, good extras","I bought this DVD with an open mind ignoring the reviews. The movie is ok. It tries to be more funny than action and some of the characters were over acted. If you liked Vincent Price's ""The Raven"" then you'll like this. I was impressed by the documentary ""Let The Games Begin."" It made me want to go out and start playing D&D again which I haven't done for over ten years."
1,This dungeon's a drag,"Other than Jeremy Irons' over-the-top performance as an evil wizard and some fairly elaborate sets, this absurd and unimaginative movie has absolutely nothing to recommend it. Look, people, I wasn't expecting much when I settled into my seat to see a movie based on a role-playing game popular among pre-teens, but this sort of thing can, and often does, have a certain air-headed charm. But this flick is just painful--lame dialogue, undistinguished acting, and one of those connect-the-dots storylines that just plod on and on. Kids deserve better than movies like this. Come to think of it, so do I."
1,Worst movie. Ever.,"Seroiusly. I'm not one of those dice/roll playing guys that has adventures in his parents basement, aka Lord Sinister's Crypt of Mayhem. Definately not one of those, but after years of people playing the games and hearing all about it when they accidentaly killed each other on the news.... I expected this to be a pretty good movie. ESPECIALY considering the whole point of the game is to CREATE STORIES. And this movie had none. I can't possibly say more than that."
2,Don''t waste your time,"There are just so many ways this movie stinks. Bought it for my kids who had not seen it in the theater. They hated it and so did I. If you feel you have to see it, rent it! Some good special effects make up for some of the awful story line, there are a few likable characters but for the most part I would have rather been having root canal!"
3,AD&D fan,Not the greatest movie in the world but is entertaining if you are a fan of AD&D. I enjoyed watching it just to remember the days I played the game.
1,Soul crushingly bad,"When I went to see this in the theater I expected to see the worst movie I'd ever seen.I did.If you are considering renting this or whatever just for a laugh, don't bother. I am readily entertained by virtually all movies, but this one didn't work at all. There is no joy in this movie whatsoever. Well, the villain was pretty hilarious on occasion, but not frequently enough to make this anywhere near bearable.Beware."
1,Easily the Worst Movie I Have Seen to Date,"It has been many years since I watched this travesty of a film, but even after thousands of competitors, I still find Dungeons & Dragons to be the worst film I have seen. As a big fan of the D&D game (I grew up playing it for years) I had high hopes for the movie. A budget of 35 Million dollars at the time was quite a lot of money, and Jeremy Irons is one of my favorite actors (for Irons at his best, try the original Brideshead Revisited miniseries). It gives me no pleasure to pan the film, or Irons' performance in it, but there is just no other way... they just were both *terrible*. With cheezy special effects, ridiculous dialogue and acting that is scary bad, you wind up with one big mess. My favorite line from Irons as Profion was ""I'm looking for my stone... I want my stone!"" You can imagine with dialogue like *that,* the actors did not have a chance. Avoid at all cost."
1,"Good for somebody who is five years old, probably","This movie has no redeeming value at all. The acting was really terrible, especially coming from people who won oscars. The script doesn't make any sense. I also have never seen such terrible special effects! You get to see the fakest looking fantasy city ever. Do yourself a favor and watch the cinematics in the awesome PC game, Diablo 2. They totally kick this movie's arse and THAT is a fact."
1,How can we possibly still make movies so bad?????,"This movie did not live up to even my lowest expectations. The characters were lifeless, the plot lost my interest immediately, the computer graphics were so terrible and obviously fake that it ruined any scene where they were used, and the acting was HORRIBLE (Oh my God, I mean horrible doesn't even begin to describe it). Even Jeremy Irons overdid it with the soap opera drama that teetered on the comedic. The movie centerpiece ""rod"" looked like a toy picked up at at a local K-Mart complete with a flashing light (and probably even pulsating sound too). I am so mortified that I came so close to buying it without renting it first. The only redeeming qualities were the costumes, the score, and the reason behind why it was made.... to capture the fantastic worlds created by the game Dungeons and Dragons."
1,Be Warned,This was without a doubt the worst attempt at making a film I have ever in my life witnessed.
2,"It is a critic for the movie, not the DVD","Ok, let me begin (by the way, sorry for my english, Im latin guy): the movie is BAD. I don't care about special effects or rule violations, I don't mind if the evil guy is pathetic (incredible, how you can make of a good actor a pathetic character), but, for the sake of god, the very basics of ANY Dungeons & Dragons story is TEAM WORK!!!. And here you have a group of people that just follow Ridley (the hero) and don't do NOTHING. I mean NOTHING!!! The principal idea of the movie was not bad, but the sequence doesn't have any sense... The Izmar Queen is a bad copy of the Neverending History movie, Profion laght like a maniac ALL THE MOVIE... And, the final sword battle between Damodar and Ridley is so false... and is a copy of Starwars. I think that must exist more or less 25.356 D&D DM worlwide with a better story to tell. I give 2 stars and not 1 because some scenes were fun...Sorry guys, another deception for the D&D fans..."
3,>.<,"Hey, what's with the negative atmosphere here, eh? I've seen this movie and while I admit that it was not Academy Awards material, it wasnt as bad as everyone is making it out to be. To tell the truth, I loved it, and I still love it. Its vintage fantasy - practically classic in my opinion.So its not highly original. So the effects arent LOTR cailber. SO WHAT? There is no movie on earth that IS original (unless we're talking, like, the first movie ever made, but you know what I mean). Its a great movie with good acting, a decent plot and special effects that work for me. I recommend it to anyone who has the (obviously RARE) ability of willing suspension of disbelief and the enjoyment of all things fantasy."
4,Enjoyable if taken for what it is,"OK, I'm an old time D&D player from back before there even *was* an AD&D... so I went to this movie expecting more ""D&Disms""... However, once I realized that the elves weren't going to be like D&D elves and the world wasn't going to be quite D&Dish, I sat back and enjoyed a fairly good fantasy movie. The plot was very simple and predictable, but what Sword and Sworcery movie isn't? The DVD offers the ""alternate"" ending, which, while not as upbeat as the theatrical version, was a better one."
3,good movie,"The movie was good. For those that are hard core D&D players, I can see where you might not like it. But, it is just a movie and it was entertaining. I say buy it!"
1,WHY?!!,"I used to play D&D when I was younger. I loved it. I dreamed of the day that they would make a D&D film. Imagine my disappointment when this load of garbage came out. I was stunned. Why would they make such an obviously rotten, stupid film like this? Why? They had so much material with which to work.Just look back at all the incredible scenarios that the makers of D&D put out over the years. Utterly brilliant stuff. So why didn't they just adapt one or more of these scenarios? Why? They totally blew a great opportunity. This film could have been as good if not better than ""Lord of the Rings"" if they had the right storyline.I weep for D&D."
1,Pathetic,"As a 20 year player of Dungeons and Dragons, I have to say that this movie is one of the worst ones I've seen in my entire life. The only entertainment value in it is laughing at just how bad the acting, dialogue, and story is. ...wait for Lord of the Rings to come out this winter."
3,I've DM'd a better dungeon!!!,"Don't get too excited by the title, for this is a Dungeons and Dragons film in name only. If you are looking forward to seeing beholders..errr..don't...there seen for 10 seconds and they do nothing, apart from float. The final Dragon battle scenes suffers from, what I call, Phantom Menace'itus. This is to say all you want to see at this point is lots of dragons fighting. But what you get is a poorly directed scene that chops and changes without you ever really being able to get fully immersed in the action. The middle part of the film is shallow and the full potential of a fantasy setting is never realised.As a kids entertainment film it is fine. As a Dungeons and Dragons movie hire it out on video on rainy night when there is nothing else to do. Sorry but its true."
1,D&D didn't deserve this,"The movie is disappointing in all aspects. For those out there who follow the D&D universe this movie is a total let-down. I would even say that the only thing in common between AD&D and this movie is its title. The way I see it it's not worth renting, let alone purchasing."
2,"Had potential, however lacked A LOT in many areas.","Before I saw it in theatres I was very excited, however when the movie ended, I was miffed at how cheesy the whole movie was.It started out good: Good guys doing the ultimate theft in the Magic School, being caught by the chick. Then it went downhill from there. If Jeremey Irons was the badguy, how come we didn't see very much of him? What was the deal with the heroes sword? And the ending was the worst of all. The heroes main sidekick (I forget his name because this movie was soo aweful) did he die? Was he resurected? Or like Tupac, abducted? You tell me, I never figured it out.This movie had potential to be an excellent movie that could have outdone Lord of the Rings however like Star Wars, the director focused mainly on the special effects which was the only good thing about the movie."
2,"Umm, well.......","There is nothing I can say about this movie that hasn't already been said.Yes it was a disgrace, yet I've seen worse.It had promise yet left me wanting.I could guess what was going happen most of the time. Also most of the acting was alittle to much, as if they were trying to cover up something,yet that only made it all the more abovious.I have never played or read D&D, but this movie did have good parts(sorta).Just not many.Also Am I the only one that noticed we don't see what happens in the scroll.It's driving me nuts.And ofcourse when they come back out the look at eachother as if they'd made out or something.You can see it if you want, for it isn't to bad, but also not the greatest."
1,MAYBE IT WILL BE CULT SOMEDAY....,"I'm not a RPG player. I'm judging this movie only because I'm a fan of epic, medieval and adventure movies, like LADYHAWE and BRAVEHEART, for example. So, I went to see this movie with the highest expectations, since I knew it was going to be based on the most famous RPG of them all. Guys, what a dissapointment, what a shock!! Third-rate acting, lousy costumes, cheap special effects. Sometimes, you even succumb to the temptation that this is a fun movie, so bad it is. One that will probably go ""cult"" with the passing of time. On the other hand, you simply think that this is another throwaway product made by Hollywood, aiming coldly at the innocent viewers who will pay for tickets to see an adptation from their beloved game. This is not fair game, gentlemen. As for Marlon Wayans, forget about him..."
3,Fantasy,"Nice movie to watch filled with fantasy and adventure, maybe too much magic, but it is not bad."
3,pretty good,"To be honest, the Dungeons & Dragons movie was quite good.But the real action is at streetbrawls.com.There is trouble in Izmer. With the emperor dead from an assassin's poison, the 16-year-old princess Savina inherits not just the throne but also the royal scepter, which has the power to command gold dragons.I expected a little more."
1,This was a movie?,"I could've sworn I was watching an hour or so of out-takes or audition tapes. Well, if this is a movie, IT'S TERRIBLE! Do NOT soil your expensive Hi-Fi TV's with this big pile of Marlon Wayans infected ...! The acting is downright atrocious....even Jeremy Irons gets a sigh of disgust from me. The special effects were FAR from believable, equivalent to a cut out from a cereal box being slid across the screen! The plot was a bore, everything was predictable....with traces from everyother movie in the fantasy genre.......including cheesy ripoffs from Star Wars...don't believe me? Watch it, at your own risk! Personally, I'd rather watch Wing Commander (Yuck!) 6 times back to back than watch this pathetic attempt to profit from the big screen using a popular name.Do what I did...endure to the end of the movie and start taking names of who's responsible for this waste of time.....action should be taken!"
3,From a D&D gamer.,"I enjoyed the way your started right in the adventure, rather than wasting time rolling up characters. There were a few discrepencies in the creatures, some abilities not shown or too much of a small one. I have a few problems with the acting of a couple of the actors, but feel that the adventure was fun, exciting, and true to the vision on D&D."
3,"Some of these reviewers must be ""Chaotic Evil"".","The reason I give it 3 stars is that you're supposed to rate the whole DVD, not just the movie, which many reviewers seem to be forgetting (although I must confess I enjoyed some of the more ripping reviews). Granted, the movie is not as good as it could have been, but that was partly budget constraints, and I wasn't expecting Citizen Kane to begin with. I enjoyed watching the documentaries, and even learned something, and this DVD has actually revived my interest in the game, which I haven't played in many years. I'm glad to know that they ARE making a sequel, 'cause I think the concept deserves a second chance."
1,"The ""Battlefield Earth"" of fantasy flicks","""Hey, let's spend all the money on 2nd rate sfx"" - ""cool"" ""Uh, what about actors"" ""Hmm. Get some third raters. Pay 'em scale. So what if they can't act."" ""What about a soundtrack?"" ""We can only afford six notes. Use 'em over and over.""That's how I envision the production meeting. This movie was actually painful to watch. The soundtrack was the WORST I have ever heard. It was - literally - the same 2,4, or 6 notes played over. And over. And over. And over again. God. It was the first time I wished the DVD had a ""no music"" option!!! Thankfully the *mute* button was at hand.The acting. What acting? These were acting school dropouts. Make that actor wanna-bees that were expelled. Plot? ""Who needs it"" - that's what the producers thought. It was eye candy, and sour eye candy at that.Bottom line. It was the WORST fantasy movie I have ever seen. If there were negative stars, it would get all -5.Save your money. Get a dental cleaning - it's less painful."
3,Dungeons & Dragons...,"A very nice DVD, but it moved quite fast and they never told you what the dwarf's name was... It was a little violent and sad."
3,it's a fair film...,"I don't care what anyone says... the thing is... it's a fanitasy film... I've played AD&D Many times. I must say that it doesn't cover all aspects of the games but to undermind this film by saying that the special effects wheren't that great or that the acting was bad isn't cool at all... me I thought it started out slow and the Idea of calling Mages a higher class was over doing it abit but lets be real... when I Play our party normally includes me as a Cleric, and my friends as, a fighter, a theif, a mage, the DM as a NPC(non-player Character) be it a neromancer, vampire, or high level fighter... it's the perfect team... not two theives, a low level mage, and dwarf that was aparently a fighter... then again... that was my only real beef with the movie... other wise it was good for what it was..."
1,a total crapfest,"This film was disapointing on so many levels, the major flaw would have to be the poor acting, which was below par for a daily soap, to add to this shame seasoned actors like jeremy irons acted the worst delivering over dramatic lines that come off sappy. The only positive light I can put this film in is that of a mindless summer action movie, of course with it being D&D and all this, too is sad. Speaking of D&D, did the people that made this movie look at a rulebook ? I think not, blatant problems like a young apprentice mage being able to do high level spells and a main character that changes classes atleast 3 times during the movie must have been overlooked.Basically: if you want a dumb fantasy themed movie, see D&D its *ok*, if you like D&D avoid this movie like the plague."
1,Wost Moive Ever.,"Yes I am a geek who has played the D&D game for over 20 years.This movie was just stupid. The plot was lame, the villians lacking, and the characters were horrible. Why did all the action center around the main character? In a D&D game, all the players contribute to the success of the adventure. Over the years there have been great stories and novels, why come up with a movie that adds up to a young teens adventure! The dragons weren't dragons as D&D goes, they were dumb beasts. And what's up with the warrior wearing the pink lipstick? And what the heck was stuffed into his head? The writers shouldn't be allowed to write again, ever! The director shouldn't be allowed back onto any set again! And as far as movies go the acting was bad, the story was horrible, and all I would like would be the hour and half of my life back."
2,Disliked this title,"I did not like this movie one bit. Actors are unconvincing, the storyline is extremely banal, bad costumes [you can tell they're made for a movie, not a single ounce of realism]. It wasn't worth the $5 I spent on it. There is loads of better fantasy movies out there, you're probably better of not wasting your time with this one."
3,Blue lip man strikes again!,"Ok, so I was trying to figure out why so many people don't like this movie. I came to the conclusion that most of these people are disgruntled RPG players. The rest are people who are to 'cool' to see a movie titled Dungeons and Dragons, and have no reason to bash it which they haven't. Anyway. I myself play D&D, and I got my hopes up at first about the movie. Then I realized that it wasn't being made for ME. Everyone likes something different about D&D and RPGs. The director tried to include all the elements, but it's hard to do without having a long runtime. They're making more D&D movies from what I've read so don't worry I'm sure something YOU like will be in one of them. For anyone who's willing to look past the title it's an enjoyable fantasy movie so pick it up. =)"
2,"Special Effects- BAD, Story- NOT ALL THAT GREAT...","You know, it's one thing to have movie that has bad special effects, and it's even worse when the story isn't all that great either. A lot of talent went to waste, excluding Marlon Waynes, and so did the director's career. The only thing that actually wants you to keep watching it, is the acting. Otherwise, dont waste your money on a cheap movie like this.Warning: the movie falls into the ""B"" movie category..."
2,"Thanks again, Hollywood.","Whoever the final authority on the story and script was has obviously never played the game. This movie is shameful. I work alongside Dave Arneson and it saddens me to see his highly imaginative creation (which I enjoyed in my youth) reduced to a predictable and formulaic plot, hammy acting (Courtney Solomon's fault), and dialogue filled with one cliche after another. Some of the worst scenes take place in the Thieves' Guild where the Star Wars cantina scene and Raiders of the Lost Ark are blatantly ripped off.The computer graphics, costuming, and set design are all very well done. Unfortunately the movie is lit like a cheap television show (the supposedly dingy Thieves' Guild has brighter lighting than some of the art studios I've seen).I felt robbed. Hollywood profiteers took something that could have easily been really cool and ruined it. Just as with Hollow Man it has once again been proven that all the eye-candy in the world can't save a [bad] story."
4,"It's not top notch, but its not at the bottom of the barrel!","I watched the movie and I thought is was quite good. As a gamer myself I found the variety of traps and tools quite interesting. As for everyone else out there that is complaining I would like to see them put something better on the screen! QUIT COMPLAINING AND ROLE YOUR DICE! I think it is a must watch for any DM, has good ideas for all sorts of things."
1,Basically Agree with all the1 Star Reviews,"I had this film on my wish list before it came out. I was pretty excited that they were making a D&D film using more modern methods and such. Well, I almost walked out of this movie in the theater it was so bad. It was almost like it was made by a bunch of concerned parents worrying about their teen playing the game, than actually KNOWING what D&D is all about!This film is best forgotten! Thank god for Lord of The Rings."
2,A film that you wouldn't enjoy...,What a waste of money! Reading the backform and seeing some pictures and trailers of it... you would think its quite a remarkable story and it turns out to be a dull one but one thing that is good with that is their special effects... they did a good job there but for acting... they really took it as acting... not the thing when you act it doesn't look like your acting but its real.
1,A complete waste of time,"This movie [wasn't very good]. Being a Tolkien fan, I had high hopes for this one but was completely let down. The special effects are spectacular, but the movie is ruined by the cheesy acting and the really bad direction. I don't know what a talented actor like Jeremy Irons was thinking when he took on this role. Verdict - stay away, not even worth seeing once."
2,This film is definately for..,"the eleven to thirteen year old crowd or others who have indiscriminate taste in film. I bought the dvd after seeing a trailer. Unfortunately I based my decision on a few clips of interesting looking costumes and the fact that Jeremy Irons stars.......I hope they payed him well, since he won't be in any hurry to add this one to his resume! Unless one is addicted to the D&D game, give this film a miss."
3,Not what I expected,I used to play Dungeons and Dragons about 15 years ago. I was really excited when this movie came out. I did not get a chance to see it in the Theater. So when it came out on DVD I bought it. It was very disappointing. They should have taken some of the stories from their series of very popular books.
2,Mixed Review,"I thoroughly enjoyed Dungeons and Dragons: The Movie. But I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I enjoyed it because it reminded me of the cheesier, more HORRID games of D&D I've played over the years and the fun we had butchering them - if you ever want to SERIOUSLY annoy a DM, any time he intones, ""By the Duke's Decree"" or says anything with ""duke"" in the sentence, start humming the ""Duke of Earl"" song under your breath. D&D:TM is the sort of movie you'd shuffle off to Mystery Theater 3000 as quickly as possible so you could have fun listening to the characters there skewer it. It raises popcorn-hurling to new heights of artistry. It makes ""The Barbarian Brothers"" look INTELLIGENT by comparison. You'd send the kids to watch it at a dollar matinee because there's precious little T&A in it and they're not going to grow up to be ax murderers or parking lot valets because of it. It's silly in its pretentiousness and fun to make fun of."
1,Can I have my money back?,"This is definately one of the worst movies I've seen in years!If I had made the mistake of actually paying to see this movie in a theatre, I would be tempted to walk-out right in the middle of it.I have never been so tempted before...Horrible acting, camera angles and not a very good story line.I want to sell...no GIVE away the dvd I just bought but I'm afraid that most people who have seen or heard about it will probably want to use it for a coaster...Be warned."
1,Tasha's Uncontrolable Hideous Laughter?,"This film was sooooo bad, it was almost inadvertantly funny but then it wasn't. By the end, my friends and I sat slackjawed, wondering if this horrific train wreck of a film was ever going to reach any sort of end. I'm sure there are many more ""fanboy"" jokes about how Courtney Solomon (the director) used his powers to cast sleep, feeblemind, etc. on his audience. Dear God, why? I am still baffled as to how Thora Birch, Jeremy Irons, anyone in the cast could have woken up,read this script, and thought ""You know, this will really help my career."" Really, even the CGI looked embarrassed to be there."
1,Worst movie ever!,"This may be the absolute worst movie I have ever seen! Every movie has some redeeming value but in this I could find none. Seriously... and I am a BIG fan of fantasy and D&D. I have been playing the game for over 12 years, which is why it saddens me all the more to see such a horrible rendition of a game I love so much. Now don't get me wrong, I am very open minded and I am not like a D&D version of a Trekker. I didn't look for nor care to see accuracies in the movie adaptation of the game. I just wanted to see a good fantasy adventure movie... The acting was bad, the directing was bad, the editing was bad, the story was illogical and generic, and EVEN the special effects were bad. Yes, the one thing you usually can count on in a movie these days, good SFX. But no... Even the LIGHTING was bad in this movie. Sometimes you just had a hard time getting a good glimpse of things... Now this just means that I will NEVER see a good D&D movie in my life..."
1,Only the effects save it...,"When considering whether to buy this, buy it only for the special effects. I am a long time D&D player, RPG fan, etc., and I am usually entertained by movies in general. but this was a terrible attempt to force the RPG style into a movie... the result was a movie that had all the elements but lacked depth and a story. Go watch Willow instead, now thats a real fantasy movie..."
3,I've recently noticed...,"...that, the longer we as Americans are exposed to computer-generated effects, the more we seem to criticize them. Anyone remember the release of Jurassic Park? We were amazed! Compare that film to, say, Phantom Menace, and I'll bet you rip apart JP.D & D was pretty true to the game, and as always, so many reviewers are trying to get their fulfillment from an adventure film. IT WAS FUN--quit being so analytical, people! I thought the effects were excellent, and the deleted scenes were very cool. Acting was a step above ""B"", and I'd have had a terrible crush on Justin when I was a teenager; he's a cutie! I'm a sucker for a mildly sad, good-guy-wins-the-day flick, so I'm telling you to get the DVD. I did right after it came out, and it's a fun movie!"
4,"Weird, but I liked it.","Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, Wing Commander, The Mummy (1999), and The Mummy Returns (2001); if you liked just one of these movies, then by all means see this, you might just like it. If you hated all these movies, then stay away. But if you loved all of these movies, then what are you waiting for? See this movie! Unfortunatly, I only thought MK:A and WC were OK so I only gave this movie 4 stars. This movie tries to do everything Star Wars tried to do, but unlike Star Wars, this one actually was intresting, humorous, and had a plot (no, this is not a typo). I love Marlon Wayans, and this movie was a breath of fresh air after the bomb that was Scary Movie. Sure the FX arn't anything to brag about and the acting is weak (especialy the blue-liped guy), but this movie is fun to watch."
1,"Man , this is terrible.","I didn't have high expections of this but man , it was worse than I thought it would be...much worse. The acting was so bad and so was the plot. The F/X were ok but that doesn't make a movie. It seems to me the plot was developed around the effects. This movie isn't worth a free rental at Blockbuster."
1,If I could only have that 2 hours of my life back.,"This is such an awful movie I can scarcely even consider writing about it. The incredible overacting by Jeremy Irons made me cringe, and Bruce Payne's performance is just pathetic and even incomprehensible at times... ugh.And what's with the effects where the camera zooms up and down the huge towers? I almost puked the 3rd time they did that...Awful, just plain awful, and I wouldn't even recommend it for a turkey shoot (you know, where you and your friends get together to watch a bad movie and rip it apart for fun?)... not ever."
2,Dungeons and Dragon DVD,"I bought this DVD as a gift. The case was in horrible condition; it had stickers and tape all over it. I only paid a penny for it, so it was worth the price."
1,Bad....Bad...Bad....oh so bad....,"Well, I think the title of my review about sums up the whole of the movie. The worst part about this is that I do play Dungeons & Dragons and have seen most of the attempts at making D&D movies. I had hoped there would be something good about this new one but I'm prepared to believe it is the worst yet. The acting was completely juvinile (""THE SKIES WILL RAIN WITH BLOOD HAHAHA!!""). The script was like something that had been written in the span of two days (""You're a low level mage...""). And the whole concept was as frail as a skyscraper built with matchsticks. All I can say is, don't waste your cash, heck, don't even watch it if someone else rents it. You probably have much more meaningful things to do with two hours of your life. Like doing laundry or something..."
2,Ugh! Poor Jeremy Irons!,"You don't know how disappointed I and my fellow D&D gamers were when we went to see this movie. :P My main problem was with the props. The armor and weapons looked like plastic throughout the entire thing! Sure, there were spectacular effects, but they were all but forgotten in the light of the acting and those heinous props! The maze-type scene kept my interest for about a minute, but it was just.. awful. Rent it, don't bother to buy it unless you're a huge fan of one of the actors and don't watch anything but them..."
2,"Wow, pretty bad","Maybe my age is beginning to show, but I just finished watching this movie about an hour ago, and it was pretty bad. Poor dialogue, too many characters with nothing to do, except to give token representation of non-humans, and non-interesting fight scences. Granted, the FX are really good, and watching that many dragons flying around is a wonder, but those are far and few between to compensate for the rest of the movie. My sister watched this when it first came out, and she's not a fan of fantasy at all, but she thought it was ""okay"". With that in mind, I was expecting a little more- but except for the literal dungeons and dragons in the movie, there was a minimal amount of D&D in the movie itself.>o'"
3,eh.. wasn't what it could have been,"Dungeons & Dragons.. a movie I could say I've been waiting to see for a decade. And what a let down! For years I'd been hoping to see a movie version of Dragonlance Chronicles, the perfect saga to open up the theatre for D&D movies. When I first heard about this movie I was just happy to see my all time favorite RPG up on the big screen. After seeing the previews and reading the commentary before it hit the theatres, I wasn't expecting much and that's exactly what I got. The acting was pretty bad, the story line was way too predictable, and the effects were mediocre. At least Wayans got me to laugh a few times. I'll still buy this dvd on principle.. hey, it's D&D, but if you're looking for a good dungeons & dragons type movie, look elsewhere."
3,Well the kids liked it!!,Being another Huge fan of AD&D for 15+ yrs I just had to go see it. I even conned the wife and kids to go along since this was supposedly the movie of my lifetime...WRONG. I liked this movie just because of the D&D name..truthfully no other reason. This movie was made for children. If you like Xena on TV then youll love this. The fighting scenes are rediculous..not a scratch was ever shown or maybe it was hard to see through the dirt they threw on the actors. Adding a Wayons for comedy relief was another horrible idea that still baffles me. This was supposed to be D&D not Saturday night live. To make a long story short my kids liked it so dont buy the DVD just get your kids to watch it on Saturday morning!
4,Served its purpose,"Had this microwave since 2004 and it just stopped working. While I had it, it worked great and served itself well."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I owned this microwave for a year and a half and it worked great up until went up in flames, literally!A microwave should last longer then a year and a half.My next one will not be a Sharp brand."
3,"Sounds Okay, But Not Supreme","The Supremes line-up with Mary, Cindy, and Jean sound like okay music, but it is not uniquely Supremes. Diana, Mary, Florence, and then later Cindy had a unique sound. When you listened to them you know that you were hearing that great Supremes sound. Jean Terrell sounds like an average singer...just okay. I don't understand why Berry Gordy couldn't find someone with a better and more unique voice to replace Diana Ross. A lot of people are probably praising the new line-up simply because of their dislike of Diana Ross. But, like her or not she gave the Supremes that distinctly unique sound. To me, the only catchy songs that the new line-up recorded are Up The Ladder To The Roof, and Stoned Love."
3,I'ts OK... Not the best,First off theres no support center of any kind... the company is no longer there... and It dosen't burn DVD's... and I'm having truble getting it to play DVD's... But It dose a good job Burnd a Photo CD while in the feild... so you can free up your Compact flash drives for your Digital Cameras.... SO if thats All you need ... Its Ok One to get ... but Read the REVEWS on some otheres first to make sure you get what you wont.....
1,Don't try it at home!,I got mine yesterday delivered from Amazon in 24 hours! (Just amazing -- I paid nothing for shipping selecting Super Saver Shipping - and here you are - delivered next day - but that's beside the point). To make story short - it did not work! When CD is loaded it starts making kind of loud whirling noise then stops and nothing gets it in backup mode. So I burnt few hours try to get it work and failed. Quick test showd that unit had latest firmware installed. But surely diagnostic messages are all misleading.Called support in the morning ( not tall-free number btw) and lady after hearing to these noises suggested that I should return item for replacement. That's it. I didn't try to hook it up to computer - why waste time? Will order JOBO CP 200 Apacer Disc Steno to see if there any difference.
1,destroys CD-RW,"I tried 3 different CD-R's and 1 CD-RW blank media to copy both SmartCard and CompactFlash -- all of the CD media became unusable. The CD-RW was so damaged that none of my other computers could even erase it any longer. It was only able to burn 1 CD-R correctly, but when I tried to add to the compilation with more pictures, it scrambled the table of contents, creating yet another coaster. Piece of junk -- I returned it the same day."
5,"The ""Alternative Era"" Redeemed ....","Thankfully, Lush crept into the ears of us in the states (US) when a glut of sub-grunge bands were threatening to further dumb us down. This ep captures the essence of one of the great bands of the late 80s and early 90s. I was revisiting my CD collection ... here in 2006 and was soooo happy to put this one on again."
5,Great reference book,"This was just what I needed and in great shape. I bought the book used, but it was barely used, and is a great addition to my library. Sent very promptly."
2,This book and its series are overrated.,"*3 Little Firefighters* has just under 300 words, and it's part of a series purporting to deal with math skills. So you really have to wonder what kind of breathtakingly incompetent editor would allow a number error to make it into such a small book--on p. 11, the text says, ""We've got to find four sets,"" when in fact, the book is only dealing with three sets. Now, obviously, a parent dealing with a child who can't read yet can correct this mistake himself, but I think the error is indicative of the lack of care and thought that has gone into these books. The rhymes lack creativity, the stories have no charm, and most of the books, including this one, try to teach skills that a child should pick up naturally through daily interaction with an adult. My advice: Skip this one; skip the whole series.And whoever was supposed to edit this book at HarperTrophy should learn how to read."
5,Healing Ragas,"It is Relaxing and Healing. I use it in most of my healing sessions, Meditations, and workshops. Each and every one who have heard it have loved it and express how relaxing it feels."
3,Too few questions,"It didn't take long on a prolonged road trip to realize that there are not enough questions.By the second day we were repeating questions. Certainly lost its appeal at that point. ...I also agree with the observation on the display. As a wearer of trifocals it is really a challenge to read the display and to remember/figure out how to make the game repeat the question and the choices.I like the game - but would love it if/when they make it a little more ""user friendly"".Marty"
1,Bad experience with seller,I ordered the product as a gift for a friend's birthday. It did not arrive on time and when it arrived I was asked to pay almost the price of the product in brokerage fees while I was told there were no extra cost for me. I did not accept the product and have not heard from a refund yet.
5,A must have for any 3D artist,"This is the best 3d program out there for its price range. Sure there are many better programs out there, but you need a second or third mortgage to purchase them. There are so many improvements to v6 compared to the previous versions its mind boggling. I suggest checking out Newtek's home page for a detailed list. One thing that i noticed the most, is that it is much easier to use than its predicessor. Many functions have been simplified. There are numerous hotkeys added which save you a lot of time hunting around for a certain function. If you are serious about 3d, i really recommend this program!"
4,Best Lightwave Upgrade to Date,"Newtek took it's time to deliver a substantial upgrade, but this baby was worth the wait. It would take a number of pages for me to list the improvements in detail so I will only list one crucial advancement. Simplicity for the EXPERIENCED LIGHTWAVE USER. However, if you are a beginner and rely upon the included manuals, I wish you luck. But then again, that's true with just about every version. If you are a beginner, I suggest taking a class, buying the video tutorials or surf the net for on-line tutorials from the professionals (some are better than others.)"
5,all good!,"Put on line, put on bait, cast, caught a fish... first cast, no lie. So, it works!Light, smooth, and so far it has held up. Thumbs up."
1,Very Forgettable,"These songs are very similar pop/R&B type music, but with no really good or catchy tracks at all. I only found two tracks 2. All About You and 5. Kiss & Tell marginally ok, and neither is actually going on my MP3 player. All the rest is filler with very similar beats, some even have the group talking before the song, which I don't care for."
5,Abosolutely BEAUTIFUL,"This utensil holder is a very beautiful piece, i was surprise how big it is. It looks exactly as pictured. It holds all my utensils, and i am about to purchase some other pieces to add to the collection. Try it you will absolutely love it!!!!"
4,Large Lettuce,"This crock was bigger than I expected and larger than the average utensil crock, but it is unique. It makes a statement in the kitchen....cute!"
3,annoying but useful,"I found it hard to get used to the organization and it took me a long time to find some words. Since I grew up in New England, some of the vowels phonetic classifications are in the wrong place for me. I have another rhyming dictionary which is natural and easy to use. The advantage of this book is its small size and price. I imagine that in the near future everyone who needs one will have a rhyming dictionary on their iphone.Until that day comes, this tiny book is what I throw into my backpack when I do my songwriting exercises."
3,I was disappointed,"I am a big fan of Patricia Oliver's, but this book didn't please me as much as her others. Maybe it was the over-the-top rudeness of Nicholas, the main male character, when we are first introduced to him. Maybe it was that Sylvia had lots of social interaction in the neighborhood, even though she was ""disgraced."" Maybe it was the irritating love affair between her aunt and her aunt's paramour. I almost put the book away twice unfinished. However, Patricia Oliver is an excellent writer, and I will continue to read her books."
3,Disappointing for Oliver,"This is the lowest rating I've given any book by Patricia Oliver; I normally rate her books at five stars, with one or two at four stars. For some reason, this book didn't grip me at all, and I found parts of it boring. The characters were not as interesting, and the plot not as entertaining, as her other books.The sub-plot with the painting, and the mystery about the Earl's past and his dead first wife, just didn't appeal to me, and when, close to the end, the heroine's life was at risk I wasn't remotely gripped by any sense of danger. The hero and heroine's antagonism didn't seem to ring true for me either.Not sure why... but this wasn't up to Oliver's usual standards as far as I was concerned. Still way ahead of many other authors in this genre, though!"
1,Team of Lame,"If you like watching pretentious amateurs thinking they're in the matrix, this DVD is for you. This is a DVD of purest fail, clearly put together by amateurs with no skills in video production or paintball. If you watched it on youtube, you might chuckle and move on, but to charge money for this is an offence. I bought this to learn and what I learned was never again to buy anything by these chuckleheads. Avoid like cancer."
2,Meh.,"Not Babbitt's greatest work. Well-written, but repetitive and sonorous. Especially for those who've readDemocracy and Leadership, which is a far superior book. Babbitt should be read, but not this volume."
4,Earrings,"Nice earrings. A little smaller than I thought, but they are very pretty once you have them on."
1,poor quality,"Only 11 month into usage, this TV developed a 3 inch red strip along left side of screen on all input signals. This pretty much renders the TV useless. Even before this, the TV has excessive audio buzzing noise. I have tolerated for almost a year. Definitely will never buy another Hitachi product."
5,"Hitachi Ultravision 42HDS69 42"" Plasma HDTV","This was my 1st flat panel HDTV. Its great. Size is excellent for the average size room. Picture quality is very good with just a digital signal but unbelievable with a HD signal. Sound is good ""out of the box"" but again excellent when hooked to a home theater system. Recommend use of HDMI cable to achieve maximum performance from this unit. I shopped features vs. price for a number of similar sized units and this was, by far, the best value."
1,Hatachi vicitm,"I have had the most miserable experience with my 42 inch LCD TV it has been in the repair shop more that at my home. Three trips and still the picture goes out. Customer Service is now dealing with the problem in the most unfriendly manner possible. They will not make me whole for all I have been through.Do yourself a favor don't by a Hitachi, it isn't worth the risk and abuse"
4,Great product - Go for it!,"This is our first High Def set. The picture quality, sound and features are excellent. My selection was based on the strong reviews of this product through Amazon and other sites, as well as viewing the set at a local retailer. I couldn't be happier with this set. Dealing with Amazon was excellent. My intial concerns about purchasing on-line were erased after a neighbor purchased another set through Amazon with no problems. Delivery of the set was ahead of schedule and the Amazon delivery tracking system was helpful."
4,Fantastic TV,"After months of reviewing plasma/LCD TV's I was set on buying the Panasonic 60U. Last month Hitachi came out with this native 1080i resolution TV. The picture beats Panasonic in every aspect. Rich blacks and true color will keep any viewer extremely happy. With 3 HDMI inputs, this TV is built for the future. I've only had the TV for a week, but I am very pleased.I gave it 4 stars because there are better Plasma TV's on the market, but none for the price/value comparison.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
5,Great hard cheese rater,Ordered to replace our 6-10 year-old parmesan cheese grater. Old one had dulled after many years of use. Does wonders for grated reggiano parmesan for caesar salad or pasta.
2,Waste of Money,"The book is a waste of money, the information is just common sense and I did not see how the book can help a student who should know how to use the internet. The book was a requirement for my bachelor degree with I learned nothing new from it."
3,e- learning,"good book, most of it is common sense though, i bought mine used, it will save you some money and i doubt i will use it a lot"
1,E-Learning Companion: A Student's Guide to Online Success,For a product that is supposed to support online learning I am very disappointed that there is no way to download an e-book to my computer.
3,Meh..,"I had to read this for an online class.Although it's short and laid out fairly well, most of this book is really all common sense.I'm not sure if it's really necessary for younger students but it will definitely come in handy for older students that aren't as familiar with online tools.If you are an older student less familiar with online tools, this is a must buy."
4,Great workout & nutrition advice,Lee Labrada's book has really helped me change my body for the better. It gives great advice on nutrition and exercise.
4,HMMM,SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF STUFF THAT IS ON THE INTERNET FOR FREE. i AM STILL WAITING FOR MY FREE GIFTS FROM LEE ALSO
3,The Lean Body Promise,"The Programme in this Book is quite simple to follow. The only downside are the ""jokes"" that for an international odiens are not funny. It is a bit ""too american"". My suggestion would have been to keep it more targetted to the worldwide population.I also would have used more colours for ""visual"" people."
4,Very Useful For the GYM,"This book is designed to be carried in your GYM bag. The size of this book is not bigger than your palm and it has a summary of the original book.So if you have a previous experience at the GYM and you target to loose weight and get lean in 12 weeks I advice you with this edition, but if you are a biggner and want to loose weight I advice that you buy the original book and buy the 'GYM EDITION' if you want it to be as a reminder for the exercises that you forget."
1,"""Nonfiction"" -- Walt Whitman","This is an extremely bias book that portrays Whitman as a lover of the ""common people"" and as a true red-blooded, patriotic, heroic American (complete propaganda for the U.S..) Extremely questionable ""facts"" are included that assume Whitman was in favor of the abolition of slavery and would constantly see Abraham Lincoln trotting by on Whitman's way to work. While the aforementioned may be true (no sources listed), I don't think I can believe it based on his quoted disgust of Mexico when America wanted its land. Additionally, the language and imagery of this book may make it uninteresting to children. +1 for the interesting variety of page formats throughout the book."
5,Soul R&B,"The Marvelettes are the one of the best 'girl groups' of this era. With two lead singers in Gladys Horton and Wanda Young, the Marvelettes cranked out some great dance numbers and cool ballads. Their style is a mix of pop, soul, gospel, blues,jazz and a dash of funk. Some of the best songs written by Smokey Robinson were recorded by these ladies. It's no secret the Marvelettes were one of the main catalists in putting Motown on the National Music scene. With 12 top 40 tunes to their credit and some great misses and excellent B-sides, this collection is one of the best featuring the Marvelettes and the Detroit sound."
3,A book that you would keep reading!,"My book is Humbug,it is a realy nice book.You get in to when you open it up. It's got a lot of people in the book.I think that is cool because it gets the book jumpping!So your eyes light up and you keep reading. If you like to read ?? You need to read this book.But if you dont that cool to because i read it. Hope you like the book like i did."
2,A Cosmo Quiz 95 pages Too Long,"I purchased this book on a whim. After reading it, I question my thought proces. The book administers the SICA Quiz to help identify your color pattern grid with this information you are shown theoretically how to apply this information in ALL areas of life.The quiz was fun and interesting at first, but the book seemed to DRAG on forever. Think Cosmo Quiz, 95 to 100 pages too long. I personally didn't agree with some of the ""interpretations"" and seriously question the accuracy of the information."
5,This is great stuff,"If you like Indie Pop, this album is for you. It's really great and has such a wonderful summer feel to it."
1,Don't buy this software,"This software is majorly messed up. When it works it does what it says, but it's a major pain to get it to work. It's constantly giving me errors and refusing to scan. This was the worst software purchase I've ever made. It doesn't even deserve the one star minimum."
1,TextBridge that goes nowhere,This product is completely worthless. I am pretty good w/ computer hard/software but I wasted far too much time trying to get this program to work decently. The writers of this program must have dropped acid while they were writing the code for TextBridge...and I trusted the Xerox name. Shame on me!
1,TextBridge Pro Millennium,"TextBridge Pro Millennium was a big disapointment. First of all it was the installation phase, it seems that when it reaches the part where it goes to add TextBridge menu to Word 2000, it fails and produces an error, then exits setup. Second, There's a major glitch in the software and I don't think the company is able to resolve it. I have been communicating with them for months with no solution. Third, everytime you contact/email customer support, you get a different person handling your problem (it is not like your file/problem is assigned to one person). Fourth, their online help or support material relates to an older version. My advise: ==> look somewhere else !"
3,a different approach,"The second record of the Soledad Brothers is a lot more experimental than their previous release. This record demonstrates a mellower side of the band as well as songs which are not entirely bluesy. If you are a big fan of the Soledad Brothers, than I would recommend this album so that you may hear a different side of the band. I would not recommend this album to anyone who is not a solid fan."
3,"Strong on theory, weak on practical.","I found this book to be an excellent theoretical discertation of the subject, with much emphasis on technical information. Good graphs. Almost intimidating. However it was lacking in what I expected, based on the title, that is practical information that would be of value for the average person wanting to build their own speakers. Frankly, an expert would already understand the information presented in this book, while it's well beyond the novice's capabilities, so I don't know where it would really be of oustanding value... perhaps as a lab reference manual? Coffee table at an audio factory?"
5,Acoustic enclosure design,Almost the definitive bible for enclosure sizing and construction. Formulas and equations including volume specification are all there. It's a great reference and a must have for any audiophile.
3,Insufficient,"As an Electrical Engineering student now working on a P.A. loudspeaker, I found this book a good introduction to the fundamentals of the Thile/Small Parameters theory. I suppose it is an excellent DIY guide for the amateurs looking for a few more equations. However, the equations are definately insufficient for the professional.A lot of space is spent on diagrams giving information already implied by previous ones. Additionally the hole book is based upon simulations by a $2500 software pack (LEAP & FilterShop by LinearX)! I cannot think of any amateur willing to spend $2500 in order to build a home loudspeaker. For the professionals using this software pack it is more than certain they need more specialized books."
4,"Good book, but lacking ???","This was a great starter book for me. I have no electrical knowledge or education, so the prospect of designing my own speakers left me at a loss. However, the reviews of this book led me to purchase it. After reading it 3 times, I know have a grasp of the basics that all the expert amateurs are talking about. Terminology, box design, and some of the principles of crossover design are all much clearer to me.However, the book left me wanting much more. Each chapter only imparts basic information, where as I wanted much more detailed information about each subject. So, buy it, but don't expect to be an expert after reading just this one book."
5,Comprehensive and Biblical,"I have found this book to be a good teaching tool on the subject of spiritual warfare and prayer. It is comprehensive in its coverage, laying a firm foundation of Biblical truth for what it teaches."
3,I never got it,"I would write an excellent review, but I never got it nor did I get my money back. Sorry about that."
4,Sea line Baja Dry Bag,"The 20L dry bag (green) served us well on our recent rafting trip through the Grand Canyon. We used it to carry our personal gear (camera, clothes, first aid materials...) while on the raft during the day. It kept the gear dry when closed properly. I debated on size to get but this size was good for us. It can fold down smaller when less is put inside. It would be easier to have a bag that is not like a stuff bag and opens wider but for the price, this was a great bag."
5,It Really is a Dry Bag,"I bought this bag for my motorcycle trips, need a tough waterproof bag for riding in the rain. This is a heavy duty waterproof bag that kept all my personal itmes dry in some pretty bad weather."
5,Stay Dry,Works as advertised. Very good bag for boating. The sizes can be tricky dbl check before ordering. Recommend this product in any size.
4,good but not perfect,"I got a 5L bag and overall it's a good bag but a little too heavy for backpacking. My main issue is that the opening is very small while the bag is fairly long. Combined with it's stiff material, it's hard to pack bigger items into it. Would be nicer if it was wider and shorter. I prefer the storm sack and the USMC sack which has a built in air-valve to let the excess air out once closed."
4,Wonderful Prepper Item,"I purchased the 10liter dry sack and I must say, it is a very well made item. Thick, sturdy and certainly capable of protecting (and keeping dry) any items that you place within it, this item even comes with a 'built in' handle.I look foward to buying a few more of these in various colors."
4,Delivers on the promise,"This product delivers on its promise of keeping your valuables dry. I took it on a trip to Thailand and went on boats, kayaks, beaches, etc. No sand or water ever entered the bag. The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars was that while on this trip I saw other versions of this bag where there was a carrying strap attached (from the manufacturer) which makes a lot of sense because this bag isn't convenient to carry. Otherwise, this product delivers on its promise."
5,Great Little Water Proof Bag!!!!,"Bought this little bad boy to put all my personal gear in (cell phone, camera,...) when I go on my kayak trips. Works great and just the right size! Holds all the little things you want in arms reach but don't want them to get wet. Have taken this thing everywhere from fishing to rafting and it has not let me down yet. Would recommend this to anyone needing a bag that will keep your stuff dry even in the wettest conditions."
5,Field Tested...,"This will fully keep all your worldly possessions high and dry...gave it a good field test on its first time out as I found myself rolling my 'yak 3X...it toggles nicely to the boat and did not wonder down river on its lonesome. I bought the 5 liter which held my small items quite well(cell, wallet, keys, small camera) but if you plan on taking anything else I would rcmd moving up a size... A big plus is it does not take up storage space when not in use like the water tight boxes..."
4,"Great dry bag, but poor size info","The quality of this bag is fantastic for the price. I don't have much doubt that it will keep its contents dry.My only complaint is that it took me 3 orders to get the right size for my needs. The measurements in the description don't quite describe how huge this bag is. I returned it and bought a Size 30 which was again too big.I returned that too for a size 20, which is still a bit big for my tastes but I was not able to return it for a smaller size."
5,Great for kayaking!,"I just began kayaking and needed to protect my items, this bag was the perfect size for a towel,t-shirt,phone anything I need to have with me.Also for camping besides the moisture factor it keeps any little crawly creatures out.The price was great! Highly recommend!Kayaking in Georgia"
5,MWS best album!,"Along with Change Your World, this is my favorite Michael W Smith Album. Love Me Good is a cringe-worthy song, but otherwise excellent album. I would say this is Michael's best album."
4,An Underrated Album That Deserves More,"MWS, or Smitty, has been around forever, or pretty close. However, I wasn't a big fan of his earlier work, it just wasn't my cup of tea. It just seems too old fashioned. Unfortunately after this album he went back to that format. But, after a good 15 years MWS had to change his format, do something different, or at least for part of the album. The result? His best work in my opinion.The first two songs are MWS's best songs of his career. They're different, they're good, one is peppy, one is somberish. (Is that even a word?) It continues through a good first half of the album, then I would say it get boring again, and becomes just like his old work. So did he just use that because he already had it, and he didn't have anything better? Anyways, they're not as good as the first part, and they feel out of place.Overall, a refreshing album from MWS, and his best. And we can only hope he comes out with another one just like it."
4,Michael still has it!!,"""Live the Life"", has to be the best Christian song that MWS has written! It is so relevant for today's world!! MWS has a way of relating to others through his music, especially me!""Missing Person"", describes myself so thoroughly that I would have thought he wrote that song especially for me if I didn't know any better! If you don't own this cd, you should!!"
5,Best ever album from MWS...,"I had to buy it the first day that it was on sale here in Australia which was the 4th of May. Ever since, I listen to almost all the time. Any one in doubt - buy it now. There's no regrets.Well, done to Smitty. Best of luck in the future!!!Best fan in ""Down Under"" Lidz..."
5,MUSIC WITH A MESSAGE OF HOPE,LOOKING BACK AT EARLY MUSIC FROM MICHEAL WAS NOT SO INTENCE AS THIS CD. THE MESSAGE FROM THIS CD IS GREAT. IT TAKED YOU BY THE HAND AND TAKES YOU THROUGH SO MUCH OF YOUR LIFE. IT CAN MAKE YOU THINK ABOUT THINKS THAT YOU HAVENT THOUGHT OF. EMOTIONS RUN WILD ON THIS CD. YOUR EMOTIONS. FIND YOURSELF AND GOD WILL SHOW YOU THE WAY. SONGS THAT SHOW YOU THE WAY. WAY TO GO MICHEAL!
5,Best Smitty CD since i 2 (eye),"Michael W. Smith has taken the time to create a fine work of art. The lyrical depth of the songs, especially Wayne Kirkpatrick's ""Never Been Unloved,"" is refreshing, and the musical energy of ""Love Me Good"" is on par with ""Picture Perfect"" or anything off of The Big Picture."
4,"Good & Mature, but very much overhyped.","Favourite tracks include 1, 3, 4, 9, 10 Needed a bit more synth driven dance/pop tunes"
3,A Mixture Of Emotions,"Well, Ive bought every single one of Smitty's CD's, and this one was a bit disappointing. I liked the music, but I would of liked to hear more of his keyboard playong skills, as in earlier albums, and a little bit less guitar. The lyrics were also o.k., but i was also looking for more mention of Jesus and God, instead of just getting close (such as in ""Missing Person""...""one to the powers that be""), if you catch my drift. I did however, like how the first four songs sounded, and I also would recommend this CD, along with all his other works. Great job, and I'm looking forward to the nxt CD, and the next, and the next, etc., etc."
5,The definitive work by Christian Music's balladier,"As a fan of MWS for more than a decade, I am overwhelmed by Live the Life. Though always the master composer and up-and-coming pop star, this project dares to ask many deep questions without always providing those pat, Christianese excuses for answers. I also feel that MWS' musical style has evolved to the point of distinction. His signature compositional style (along with Wayne Kirkpatrick's lyrics) have always evoked a strong sense of God's presence for me. Now, this edgy but somehow refined project couples my love for a light, alternative sound with my need to be drawn closer to God. Bravo, gentlemen."
5,THIS IS THE BEST CD I HAVE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE!WONDERFUL!,iF there was another Michael W. Smith Collection CD every song on the Live The Life CD would be on it. Superb! His best ever! I am highly anticipating his new release' This Is Your Time' If it is even Half as good as the Live The Life CD it will be great! This is the CD to get! The Live The Life CD is better than the Rich MUllins 'Songs' CD. The most you could ever want in a CD!
2,Very disappointing! Very over-hyped.,"Smitty said, ""This may be the best stuff that I've done."" Come on Smith. This isn't the best you've done. What about Change the World? I like the acoustic sound on this album, but there are so many cliches on this album that it makes me want to put on something else. I like Missing Person, but Love me Good is to put it bluntly, dumb. Is that a song to worship God with? Are you ashamed to say ""Jesus"" and Saviour instead of ""the man upstairs"" or ""the powers that be."" Come on, I belive you are a Christian, but have you sold out to the almighty dollar? And ""In My Arms Again"" has a nice melody, but once again many cliches. I'll just listen to my older recordings and wait for your next effort. My favorite was ""Hello, goodbye."""
1,Severly disappointed,"This was definitely Michael W. Smith's worst album. I was disappointed by the cheeziness in his lyrics. He seemed like he was trying to hurry the release of the album and it lacked thoughtfulness. The music was so full of cliches that I wouldn't even purchase it if you enjoy creative music, but if you want something that doesn't spark any imagination and sounds like everyone else, I would suggest this album. If you like thoughtful and creative music, don't buy this one."
3,"Micheal W. S. is a great person, & his music has great words","After listening to Live the Life, I think my favorite song is Missing Person. I think that song sounds very cool, although that words are hard to get at first. I respect MWS, but I think that he has been around for too long, and his CD's are beginning to sound all the same. I think he needs to be more unique."
5,Absolutely Awesome!!!,I thought that this was truely his greatest work yet! The songs are just electrifying. Song after song is a hit. There are no sleepers with this one. I never really have been into Smith's works before this album came out. Many of the songs are very upbeat and exciting. It is one of my most favorite albums.
5,The Best,"This is the best MWS album I've ever heard (but to be fair, I haven't heard them all). I really like the variety. I think ""Missing Person"" is the best song ever written, taking melody, music and lyrics into account. I liked it when I heard it on WOW 98, but this arrangement (well, the beginning) makes it even better. All the songs are good and worthwhile. I love ""Love Me Good"" and I cried on ""Hello, Goodbye"" (the last song...I think that's what it's called). --Abigail"
5,An Man Blessed by God,"Michael W Smith has simply been blessed with a fantastic talent of mixing creative multi-level music with spirit moving lyrics. If you want an absolute treat, get this album. Take a moment to pray for him as he continues to reach an unholy world. Thank you, Michael for touching my life, and yielding to the spirit of God. God bless you!"
5,"An excelent, energy-full cd, for all people","This production is one of the best from this artist. He mixes various styles to get through almost everybody who enjoys christian music. Listening to this CD can satisfy even the thoughest of listeners as he takes you through a wonderful, and delightful journey in your heart."
5,One of my favorites,One of my favorite CD's of all times. This album has it all I highly recommend it.
5,Powerful CD,"I'm a big jazz fan so Michael W. Smith is new to me. My wife listens to a local Christian station and thus I was exposed to the music. When I first heard a Michael W. Smith I knew right away this guy was good. Live the Life is an excellent CD. Like many of us, I can identify with Missing Persons. I also find Live the Life a powerful song. I was surprised to learn that he wrote In My Arms Again for the movie Titanic. Song For Rich is a nice bagpipe tune. Hello, Good-Bye brought me to tear because I almost lost my little one after he was born. That one hit very close to home. I find this whole CD a power influence. I also bought his 2 Christmas CD's."
5,I LOVE this album!!!,"I bought this (cassette) when it first came out. It was a favorite of mine then, and continues to be now. The various artists really delivered with fresh takes on some classic Christmas songs. Almost everyone winces at Steve Taylor's ""Winter Wonderland"", but just keep in mind different cultures celebrate Christmas differently. White Heart really delivers with ""The Little Drummer Boy"". I STRONGLY suggest this album to anyone who likes Christmas music as much as I do."
2,jmic,This film seemed to me to be a prequel to some shoot-em-up video game with Kathy Long as a computerized heroine. Can't imagine why such a fine actor as Lance Henriksen would participate. I was exhausted watching him lug the costume around. No doubt Lance and Kris had a good laugh over how to play truncated synthetics.
3,Kathy Long's fight scenes are truly spectacular!,"Though the script, plot, and much of the acting leave much to be desired, the 5-time world champion kick-boxer will have you convinced that she could take on an entire human army single-handed AND kill cyborgs. There are humorous parts too (some intentional, some not), clever parts and some parts that are just plain bizarre. (See if you recognize the head cyborg dude - he is a crack-up.) All in all it is very entertaining. Hey, Pyun, we want a sequel!"
3,Plot Synopsis,"In the ravaged wasteland of the future, mankind is terrorized by Cyborgs--robots with human features--that have discovered a new source of fuel: human blood. Commanded by their vicious leader Jb (Lance Henriksen), the Cyborgs prepare to overtake Taos, a densely populated human outpost.Only one force can stop Jb's death march--the Cyborg Gabriel (Kris Kristofferson), who is programmed to destroy Jb and his army.In the ruins of a ransacked village, Gabriel finds Nea (Kathy Long), a beautiful young woman whose parents were killed by Cyborgs ten years earlier. Now she wants revenge. They strike a pact: Gabriel will train Nea how to fight the Cyborgs and Nea will lead Gabriel to Taos."
4,Blood sucking robots,Can you really go wrong watching a movie about blood sucking robots. This is one of the best B movies out there.
5,Soft Red Licorice!,"Panda Red Licorice has a unique Raspberry flavor unmatched by any other raspberry red licorice! The individually-wrapped candy bars are a perfect way to get a licorice fix on the go--just pop a few into a pocket or purse. They're soft and chewy, but not sticky like the super-soft Aussie licorice."
3,"Good, but not great.","We are big fans of the Panda items, but these are just good, not great. Raspberry flavor is very weak.UPDATE: We got another box in and these are much better. Not sure why the inconsistant quality. Maybe we got a first bad batch?"
2,beware of the description and pictures!,WOW- being a professional cabinetmaker for the pasts 30 years I have collected a lot of tools and machinery to help me in producing my cabinetry. I like a new machine when i can get it and some older machines are great too if they have not been missused. I bought this powermatic 27S for a great price and when I received it it was missing the miter slot. The ad showed one and in the specs it listed with or without a miter slot. well let me tell you it has to be one or the other not both. I wanted this USA made machine because so much of the new stuff is junk and hard to get parts. well this was dissapointing to and trying to get powermatic or amazon to correct this HAS TAKEN ME OVER A MONTH. good luck? you would be better off going to a wood machinery dealer. I'M STILL WAITNG FOR A NEW TOP WITH THE MITER SLOT THE OTHER TOP WAS POOR QUALITY!
1,Wow....just wow.,"This movie was the most pretentiously feminist, convoluted, unresolved piece of junk that I have ever laid eyes on. Save yourself an hour and a half and do something more productive. Seriously."
5,Flea Circus Video Wonderful,"This instructional video tape is absolutely fanastic. The directions are clear and easy to follow. The care the author puts into making his flea circus is shown. Following him, your flea circus will be fantastic. There are regular updates on his website, as well as new ideas and inspiration. The author has been extreamly helpful, which is worth far more than the cost of this video. I would recommend this to anyone interested in a fabulous presentation. Highly recommended. This is probably the best valued purchase a magician, clown, or other performer could make."
1,Don't waste your time if youre really interested in curtains,"This book is not for someone who truly wants a resource book for making curtains. There's not a lot to this book, just some 70's style window treatments, no real substance. It's pretty to look at, once, then sit on the coffee table."
2,lots of pictures; little instruction,"There are many well-done photographs of rooms and windows, but not enough detail and instruction for a Design resource."
5,An inspired and inspiring book!,"I absolutely LOVE this book. I hardly ever read the text in decorating books--preferring to absorb the pictures and captions--but I actually read this one and learned a lot about the topic. Now I open up this book, look at a few pages, and then feel inspired to go and try my own take on some of the ideas shown. It gets me going for a weekend filled with projects!! One of the best decorating books I've bought (and, guiltily, I've got quite a stash.)"
5,Eastwood the great!,"Clint fulfills the promise of his film-making expertise thus far. The Unforgiven is a heart-wrenching story that tells the unsparing truth about the impact of violence. Great acting, cast, and cinematography!"
5,An alluring vision of Evil.,"Oh, but how the dark nature of man can be. This is a movie of furious complexity and like all things complex, it is wonderfully simple. It makes one wonder; can we change? Or should we just accept what we are? There is a strong pull towards darkness here, one that is strong because it's so terrifying and so enticing. Unforgiven implies that violence will be the only path, if we don't just forgive and move on. This movie is an unabashed look at how difficult it is to be an enlightened human being, about how difficult the struggle to be good really is, about how one small and simple pull awry, can un-do years and years and years of walking along the straight and narrow path."
5,More reality than spaghetti,"In brief, when I watched this film I felt as if I were really watching events of the last century taking place before me: the characters were all real to the bone, the storyline intriguing, and the action gripping. I couldn't help but contrast this production with older westerns made up through the 60's or so, where heroes wore white (spotless) ten-gallon hats, with black shiny boots and silver medallions all over their clothing and tack. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes westerns."
1,Amazed at some of the good reviews!,"My impression of this movie was that it had no plot. I watched the entire 131 minutes in hopes that something would develop to match the acting talents of Eastwood, Hackman and Freeman, the last of whom in my opinion was mis-cast into a roll expressing no strength of character. Although, we were warned by the R-rating, I thought it went somewhat beyond that point by illustrating that real bravery and good shooting is gained by drinking excessively, and portraying prostitutes as perhaps having the best depth of character of anyone in the movie. One good thing about it was that it ultimately ended."
1,"Lousy western, but my wife likes it.","I run hot and cold with Clint Eastwood. Hot with movies like ""Outlaw Josey Wales"", and ""Dirty Harry"". ""Unforgiven"" ranks right up there with""Bridges of Madison County"" as two of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Sorry fans!"
1,Overrated and dull,"This is one of the most overrated movies in recent memory. So often Hollywood awards an actor late in his career, acknowledging past slights. So, you have John Wayne winning the Oscar for True Grit, when he should have won it years ago for other roles. And now you have Clint Eastwood winning awards for this movie...boring, dreary, and very dark. To see Clint at his best, check out The Outlaw Josey Wales, and save your money and time. Clint sold out to Hollywood a long time ago, and should retire gracefully (and soon!)"
1,I want my money back!,"I bought this film expecting to watch an exciting and a full action-packed story, and besides being a movie acted and directed by Mr Clint Eastwood, I said, this must be the best Westen movie ever made, but, It was boring, Eastwood's character was weak and unappalling, and I had to expend the whole Sunday afternoon watching this. There are much better mexican westerns. The only actor that keeps afloat the movie is Gene Hackman. I recommend you instead: ""The Magnificent Seven "", for me, this is the best Western ever made."
5,Great film transfer,"Pretty much everything has been said about this movie...it is Eastwood's best Western, which it achieves by dropping all the trappings of Western films. It's ironic, but this film can be considered an anti-western, anti-violence film, because it depicts it in such a truthful and brutal way, which makes for a stark difference to the usual glorification of violence/gunplay seen in the Westerns of old.The blu-ray transfer is just about perfect. For the age of the film, it's quite beautiful, especially when you see the panoramic views and harsh beauty of the West the film represents.This blu-ray disk is also loaded with extras...many featurettes about Clint Eastwood, as both a director and an actor. There is also a full episode of ""Maverick,"" an old Western TV show, that features Clint Eastwood in one of his earlier performances.I highly recommend you get this film, period."
2,TERRIBLE QUALITY!,"How sad. One of the best films ever. I purchased this film with great anticipation. It arrived on time, in perfect condition, until I played it. This is the worst film quality I have ever seen. Grainy, blurry, terrible lighting contrast. It amazes me that a corporation with the rights to selling dvds so highly acclaimed would ruin their reputation and insult their customers by having the greed and, to their shame, the lack of intigrity, to distribute such garbage. Save your money. Don't buy this dvd...it is too lousy to even try to watch."
5,In my Top Ten List,"Unforgiven is not just a Western movie. It is a statement. It is in my top ten list of all time great movies. This is Clint Eastwood at his best. The movie is an allegory, metaphor and masterpiece. The characterization of human failing, guilt, determination, cruelty,love, hate,and indifference in one movie is beyond measure. The blu-ray version captures the beauty of the country with magical sunsets amidst a story of revenge and ultimately a quest for forgiveness."
5,Unforgiven DVD,"This movie has many of the actors I really like, so figured it would bea good one. I purchase many of our movies from Amazon due to thembeing very reasonable in price, and free shipping over a certaindollar amount."
5,Eat it!,"This is a great western. With Clint and Gene at the helm on this one, nobody can deny the quality film that this movie became. I am an avid fan of Clint's and many other amazing western films and this is up there in the top ten. People who gave this film less than 5 stars do not know what a good film is...and can go on complaining about quality films because their bad taste blinds their senses and minds to the truth that is the greatness ""Unforgiven"". And truly you will not be forgiven for your bad taste.The vengeance is epic...true to old spaghetti westerns...this is a very good film."
3,Unforgiven review,"I watched this movie in my anylysis of media class and enjoyed it. I""ve never seen a full western movie, but this one made me want to watch more. It had all the aspects of a typical western. The climax was the shooting seen in the saloon where Munney(Eastwood) defeats all the gunmen. Unforgiven overturned the genre of the western in this cowboy movie."
3,Underwhelmed,"Perhaps the hype surrounding this movie elevated my expectations to unrealistic heights but regardless, I still did not greatly enjoy this movie. It was entertaining and at times insightful but by no means was it anything but ordinary. While I appreciated the more sober and realistic look at the life of the often romanticized gunslinger, I wish the actual gun battles had not strayed into the absurd towards the end.On the other hand, the DVD picture quality itself is excellent with great detail and deep black levels."
2,"Movie: 4 Stars, Blu Ray: 2 Stars","Let's get this out of the way: Eastwood's riff on the western is a great film, with fantastic characters, a great story, and beautiful cinematography. But this transfer of it has a horrible brown sheen to it that doesn't ruin the experience but definitely doesn't justify buying it on blu-ray. I'm pretty sure the DVD I watched of it originally looked better than this transfer. If that doesn't bug you, fair enough, but buyer beware."
3,Unforgiven,"The transfer of the movie to blu ray was not as good as I had hoped for. I do have the regular dvd, and when played on my Sony bdp-S1 it looks excellent. I just did not get the wow factor on this video or audio transfer.I think most people would be very satisfied with the regular dvd."
4,Great Movie,I rated this movie 4 stars because I think Clint Eastwood. Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman are awesome actors. The movie was a little on the slow side and the shootout scene in the bar was even slower. Not the best western movie but a good watch.
5,Unforgiven = Unforgetable,"Clint Eastwood and Gene Hackman. Both intense actors! Together, they are unforgetable. A dark, realistic feeling, action packed movie that you won't soon forget. An instant classic. Do yourself a favor and add this to you collection!"
2,Unforgiven blue ray,"This blue ray movie was very disappointing in it's color and clarity. The DVD I already have is almost as good. Bottom line , I would not purchase this blue ray movie as an upgrade. It is not worth the money. Amazon should place all blue rays movies in a group. In the future I will go to other sources for reviews and purchases."
3,Merely OK,"This is a reasonably competent oater, but why the critics went gaga over it is beyond me. The first part seemed to me to be slightly pretentious and even self-conscious, not enough to make it a bad movie but more as a reminder that someone was trying to put together all the old movie themes (I will avoid the term ""cliches"") that he could think of. The last half picked up steam a little, but then it got into pop psychology, or whatever you called it in the Old West if they were calling it anything back then.I think you could give it a B+, but an Academy Award makes me think that a certain generation of reviewers had never seen a Western before, and thought that they were discovering a new genre. Or maybe Clint Eastwood has a lot of friends."
3,Not Clint Eastwood's best effort,"The real star of this movie is Gene Hackman, who is in most of the scenes. I was disappointed in this movie, in that I had hoped it would have been the types of Clint Eastwood western I've always liked. Instead, it is too preachy, and listening to Eastwood's character moralize about killing and violence was a bit too much. What little action there was, however, was excellent. If one is viewing ""Unforgiven"" and expecting to see another ""High Plains Drifter"" or ""The Outlaw Josey Wales,"" they will be sadly disappointed. Eastwood could have done better and made a western more true to his form."
3,I've Seen Better,"I really don't get what all the hype is about with this movie. I was stunned it even won best picture. As far as Clint Eastwood westerns are concerned, this was near the bottom of the barrell. The story was difficult to follow and believe, and too pathetic for a western. The whole movie lacked the teeth of Clint's other gritty westerns. As far as modern Eastwood westerns is concerned, ""Pale Rider"" was better and that isn't saying much. The ending is farfetched and the only good acting in it was done by Gene Hackman. As far as an Eastwood movie, he's done much better.The academy awards people began a sad trend of giving cheesy-boring movies best picture when they awarded ""Unforgiven"". The only other sad awards to top this one were the ones for ""Shakespeare in Love"", ""English Patient"" and ""American Beauty"". Rent a good-old, Eastwood, spaghetti western from the 60s and skip this drivel."
1,Wouldn't play-,"Couldn't get this to play as a rental. No reason why. Thanks for charging me for the rental though, next time I feel like wasting money, instead of just burning my cash, I'll rent a video."
5,Video Quality Review(Blu-Ray),"Wow, what a transfer. The feature film quality of Unforgiven is flawlessly maintained in this release. The source is perfectly clean; all colors, as well as blacks, are pure and natural. There is a drastic increase of detail from the standard DVD. Every wrinkle on the actors’ faces shows up and in this film there are quite a few wrinkles to look at. (High Definition never looks so real and stunning as when it is fed all the details of an aging face.)Unforgiven was shot on film so slight and consistent film grain can be seen throughout and the picture lacks the same perfect clarity that can be found on digitally shot features. But it is as good a reproduction of the film as it appeared in theatres as any I have seen.Recommended to any fan of the movie who is considering upgrading their standard DVD of the film.(PS3 - 1080p projector - 92"")"
4,Simply the BEST western ever made!,"A lot has already been written about this movie. I'll simply add that although it draggs slightly in the middle, this is simply the best western ever made, and Eastwood's best picture ever. A must have."
5,In my opinion the best Western ever made,"This movie operates on so many levels one can watch it over and over again and always find something new. Eastwood does an amazing job of dealing with the myths of the west, making this the most realistic western I've ever seen, and one of my five favorite films of all time. It should have won an award for screenplay too..I think it is as well written as ""Chinatown."" Definitly worth getting on DVD as the crisp photography adds a lot to the overall film."
4,Good semi-realistic Western,"Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman, and Richard Harris.The story is good, the scenes are well acted and it feels like you are back in a changing Western town where there are a lot of morally ambiguous people. This is not a feel good movie, but a movie about harsh judgements and harsh consequences."
1,Horrible!!!!,"I have no idea what the big deal with this movie is. I was told by a couple of people that it was one of the greatest movies they have ever seen. Well apparently they haven't seen too many. It was aweful. And just so you don't think I have horrible taste in movies. Here are some of the movies that I think are REALLY great: Once Upon A Time In America, Saving Private Ryan, The Shawshank Redemption, Good Fellas, Enemy At The Gates, and Life Is Beautiful. Save your money!!"
1,Boring!!!,"I cannot believe that this won any academy awards, I just don't get it. Same thing with Clint Eastwood's Mystic River, I am not sure if that won any awards but I know it was highly praised, they are two different types of movies but what they both have in common is that they are both boring and pointless, I just don't get it. I do really enjoy some of Clint Eastwood's movies, Million Dollar Baby was great as well as Gran Torino. I guess I am just not a western movie fan although I loved The Good The Bad and The Ugly and Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid was fantastic."
1,Stole my money,The only thing you will be wishing upon when you are done is where is my money and I wish I did something better on a friday night. Worst Western ever made.
4,"far above average, but not great","The swooning and gushing with which this film was greeted and beOscared just goes to show how low our standards of storytelling have gotten.Now, it's definitely worth watching -- chiefly because of the script, which is unusually insightful for that of a Western. It's definitely a good film that takes you, with a sure hand, into unexpected places.But a great film? In the pantheon of immortal Westerns, like ""Shane"" and ""The Searchers""? You gotta be kidding!The climax scene in the saloon, I admit, is sheer cinematic perfection. The rest of the movie, though, is uneven, particularly the casting of Morgan Freeman. This has to the most off-base casting of his career: at no point was I convinced that he was an evil (and horny) assassin."
5,Good Movie!!,Very Good Clint Eastwood movie. Not fully action packed as some might think but the story is good and very entertaining.
4,"Good movie, but DVD light on the extras",I rented this movie and enjoyed it. The final half hour was the best part. It had strong performances surrounded by a good story. The DVD picture and sound were well done. The DVD didn't include any extras but was still worth a rental. A great western and movie period.
3,"OVERrated, but still good",It's all these guys in their later years so kind of goofy to see them as trying to be studs. Hackman is the best thing in the movie. BR continues to miss on the extras.
2,the most overrated film of 1992,"Unforgiven is a dark, grim film that doesn't stand out in any particular area. Clint Eastwood's performance of the grim, aging gunfighter is typically one dimensional. The subject matter -- taking revenge for a prostitute whose face was slashed -- is about as grim as it gets. The cinematography couldn't possibly be more dark and depressing. It's not a particularly bad movie, but certainly not a particularly good one."
2,BORING,"I finally saw this highly touted film last night. Incredibly boring! Forget this and get High Plains Drifter. HPD has the same moral lesson as TU (Violent men may be temporarily needed to re-establish civilization when the cowardice of other men forfeited it), but it is a much more interesting and compelling film. BTW, why see Hackman's sherrif as corrupt. He is flawed to be sure, but his situation-specific violence has lead to establishment of a peaceful civilized community for women and families."
2,2 1/2 Stars: Does not deserve the hype,"I have seen probably all of Eastwood's westerns and as several other reviewers have stated, this is at the bottom of Clint's barrel. First, this cowboy flick rides a very tired old poney - the theme stolen and copied from Shane by so many other westerns of former gunfighter retires to lead normal life, must unretire to take on evil character set on running the county. Second, the acting and the script are both flat and uninteresting. There have been too many lifetime achievement awards given out lately for artists of various sorts who deserved but never received honors in the past and whose recent work is mediocre at best. Unforgiven falls into that category. If you are looking for a great Eastwood western, check out the Outlaw Josey Wales, Fistful of Dollars or the more recent and much better Pale Rider."
2,Clint moralizes on violence???,"It's good to know that I'm not alone when I say this was slow, boring, and forgettable. There isn't anything here that hasn't been done before, and better-particularly by Clint himself. Over time, I think more people will see this as a lifetime achievement 'thing' for Clint and less as any great cinematic triumph, which it's not. Stick with 'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly'. Violent (don't forget Dirty Harry) movies are why Clint even exists in the public's mind. For him to use more violence to preach about violence is too little, too late-and hypocritical too."
4,"Great old movie, violence and sex may be offensive to some.","Great old movie. Sex and violence may be offensive to some. Not for younger children, would not understand and may find it disturbing."
3,Nobody To Root For,"""Dirty Harry"" wears a different suit of clothes. I suppose it's not a spoiler by now to reveal Clint shoots all the thugs in the saloon. Gene Hackman is ""sadistic lawman"" personified and Clint is the guy who finally says ""enough is enough."" Karl Malden and Marlon Brando did it first and did it better in ""One Eyed Jacks."""
4,"Good and gritty, like western should be.","Not much to add that other positive reviewers haven't already said. If you are still on the fence about this one after working your way through this many reviews, just trust the Academy Awards."
4,"Good Classic Movie, I have seen better","The quality of the DVD was impecable! however, the movie ratings were too high for what the movie was. I have seen other clint eastwood movies and they were far better and there was more shooting than on this movie. Good casting but the movie should have had more action"
4,excellent movie with no extras,"Absolutely one of the greatest westerns of all time! HOWEVER, the DVD leaves a lot to be desired. For instance, it's practically impossible to figure out how to get to the menu page and the box implies that there are two theatrical trailers which [I could not find]! Great movie but disappointing special features."
4,Dark message in classic western flair,"The dark message comes through in this Eastwood creation of classic western genre. It is a foreboding and frightening tale of a bad man turned good then returning to his past - or is it that his past is coming back to drag him down again? The cynicism is thick in the theme that there is no one good. And even the bad are in for more than what they bargained for in this hard-hitting gun-slinging action drama. If you enjoy the do-good classics, you may not like this film which is a little heavy-handed in its realism concerning the use of violence to settle scores. Like most cynical statements, it is difficult to swallow and leaves you uneasy whether you enjoy the realism or dislike the taste it leaves behind. The story is moving and you cannot help but uneasily relate to the main character in all his violent flaws."
5,Beautiful Simplistic Realism,"This movie has tremendous realism, and almost believable context. Loved it. Good guy always wins. Roy Rogers taught me that."
2,Clint's Done Better,"Clint's done better. For example, ""High Plains Drifter"" was a far cry better. At least there was a hero in HPD; in ""Unforgiven"" this anti-hero stuff just leaves you kind of bummed out. I understand the movie's message but it just doesn't work for holding my interest. Gimme a good guy and let's just forget the depressing gray area. Believe it or not, there really are such things as distinguishable good and evil, unlike what this movie would have you believe.This movie is rather slow at times too.That they gave this movie best picture had more to do with throwing Clint a lifetime achievement bone--and the fact that it was up against weak competition that year--than it did any real merit of this movie.By the way, I would've given this movie 3 stars were it not for the groupthinked, ridiculously hyperbolic 5 starred reviews on here."
1,unforgiven,"I found Unforgiven one of the most over rated movies in Hollywood history! I am well aware of all the oscars that it has recieved but that just shows, as usual, the politics and clout that Eastwood has with this organization. The direction and character development is typical Eastwood(cardboard) and this very long movie had several places that dragggged on into boredom. Sergio Leone and Don Segal did far BETTER with directing Eastwood in Westerns. I must point out that anyone I know who saw Unforgiven came away completely baffeled about what made this movie notable! It must be noted that I enjoy Eastwood, the actor, and think that he should stay in front of the camera."
1,Cliches by the zillions,Unique. But a bar stool cowboy story that gets hopeless and stupid as the minutes pass. The plot is for the type whose lives haven't been what they expected and they take it out on others. Any fiction will do as an excuse. The plot is full of justice or so it appears. A collection of liars making up reasons to be cruel.A bit of comedy. Acting ok. Camera work good. But the plot is terrible in my opinion. A design to make money and it worked.
1,unforgiven,i dislike my order on count when i got it there was nothing on the dvd it would not play..and i am very un happy...
1,Unforgivable,"I fail to see why Clint Eastwood won an academy award for this picture because, IMO, ""Unforgiven"" is Eastwood's worst film. It's slow, dull, choppy, and unlike those great spaghetti western classics, this film lacks drama and action. If you liked ""For A Few Dollars More"" or ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"", chances are you aren't going to like ""Unforgiven"" because it's long on dialogue and short on action."
3,Great movie - awful DVD quality,"The Amazon *video/audio quality* review is a 4.5, but I would rate them a 2 out of 5 stars. I view on a 60"" Panasonic Elite Projection TV with high end audio system . Dark scenes (which are numerous) very splotchy & grainey - very poor quality!!! Sound was not clear either. Transfer to DVD does not do this great movie justice; much lower quality than other DVDs I have."
5,instant western classic,"The Unforgiven is an instant classic. The movie pays homage to the western genre but has added realism and intensity many classic westerns lack. The characters are richer and more complex than many westerns, and as I said has more realism and intensity, so you don't need to be a western fan to enjoy. Film is a dark story, so if you are looking for a feel-good cowboy, this is not the film for you."
4,"Good, but not great movie","I'm not sure how I ever missed seeing this movie until now. The plot was mostly entertaining, although I teetered on boredome a few times. The cast and acting was solid (Eastwood and Freeman are a great team and Hackman is one of my favorite actors.) However, Clint's gravelly, monotone deliver got a little tedious at times. The HD DVD transfer doesn't have the greatest picture quality as compared to some other releases, but it is still beautiful. While this was not my favorite Eastwood western (I liked Pale Rider better) it is worth at least a rental."
1,Just meh,"This movie wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. And the fact that it won the Oscar for best picture tells me that the competition that year was extremely weak. But it wasn't. This movie beat out ""A Few Good Men"" which is a travesty. It is one of those movies where you really know nothing about the main characters for 1 hour 45 minutes and then the final 15 minutes of the film is for the big reveal."
1,I didn't like this movie at all...,"Dull, boring... no matter how deep everyone thought the presentation was, the story and ideas portrayed in this movie were still very simplistic. I prefer Eastwood's ""For a Few Dollars More"" and ""Pale Rider."" I also thought Gene Hackman robbed Jack Nicholson for the Best Supporting Actor that year. Let's just say that any actor could've done Gene Hackman's part/character in ""Unforgiven,"" but only Jack could've done his Colonel character in ""A Few Good Men"" the way he did. Hackman didn't do anything special... I like Clint Eastwood and all, but I don't think this movie deserves all the praise it got at the Oscars and in reviews. I think everyone was either Western-starved, couldn't get enough of Clint Eastwood, or had this ""clouded"" viewpoint ""just because"" it was Clint. I can't take anything away from everybody else's opinions, however, I just had to state mine."
1,unforgiven,"DVD has no format to select scenes,etc. Also it was captioned with no way to remove the captions.DVD also ran for approximately 12-15 mins and could no longer be played.My fault that the time ran out to return the item."
2,The Anti-Western,"I have seen most of Eastwood's westerns dozens of times; I only watched this one once. It is a carefully crafted and very sophisticated movie, perhaps moreso than any other ""western""; but that's it -- it is really not a western after the fashion I am accustomed to.As a product of the 1950's, I grew up with westerns in the cinema and on television, and believe that a good western should have several elements: a good plot, plenty of action, and a hero that triumphs in the end, leaving one with a good feeling. ""Unforgiven"" really has little action, and we all know there is no hero. As for the plot, it is certainly better than some, but the whole sordid tale is so dark and depressing that I could not bear to watch it again.I can see why the Academy liked Unforgiven, but for someone like me, your average Western movie buff, it left me very disappointed."
5,A Classic Western!!!!,Clint did his usual best as the old gunslinger William Munny. Like he said you better bury Ned right!!!! He and liquor do not mix well as he pointed out many times how he did not remember most of the evil he did while drunk!!!
5,Upgrading From VHS,"I like that the main character doesn't want to live the life of a criminal anymore, and when an opportunity arises for him to use his ""skills"" for good (protecting others from evil) and to make some sorely needed extra money, William Munny goes back on the job. Bullies get their comeuppance in this show, but revenge as well as fighting for what's right always seem to carry it's own losses. Widescreen DVD & packaging was as expected."
2,1 side doesn't play,"The movie is great,and the packaging, shipping, ect.; was great. My problem is that you have the full screen version on one side of the DVD, and then the letterbox version on the other. The full screen side will not play. I really wanted to send it back for another one but my work schedule has been too hectic, so I was rather forced to keep the DVD. Amazon was great , as always, with shipping, ect. I wish I could trade the movie for another copy of it."
3,"The Weakest of Books, Better Available","The Weakest of Books, Better AvailableBeing a professional candle maker (3rd generation) and an avid reader, I have a huge collection of candle and soap making books. After looking over ""Making Candles & Soaps for Dummies"" for perhaps the 3rd time, I can honestly say that there are many better books covering both subjects. This book covers only the very basic information and will leave you with more questions than answers.For the candle side, I highly recommendBeginner's Guide to Candlemakingor the instructional videoIntroduction To Candle MakingOn the soap side, trySmart Soapmaking: The Simple Guide to Making Traditional Handmade Soap Quickl Safely, and Reliably, or How to Make Luxurious Handcrafted Soaps for Family, Friends, and Yourself.These are both great hobbies that can become good sideline business and there are good resources available on the subject... this book is not one of them."
2,Review of linked supply source,I appologize that this is not an actual review of the book but a warning about one of the merchants that the book suggests you buy products from. I suggest that you DO NOT order soap making products from Well Naturally Products. Check out the Better Business Bureau on line first. I unfortunately failed to do that and had my credit card billed 60.00 and so far it's been a month with no products and no replys to my inquiries.This may have been a fine company when the book was written...but I'm not so sure about that now.
2,"Not as helpful as others in the ""Dummies"" series","I usually love the ""Dummies"" books and was hoping this one could teach me about soapmaking. It really didn't have much in the way of helpful information and I ended it returning it."
2,Wish I could get it to work,Sounds like a great CD I wish I could get it to work with my windows vista operating system. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated?
4,glad to find it,"An old book we relied upon with our children, now 24 and 30.A vintage gift to our expectant daughter."
4,Nice live retrospective,"Well chosen set of real live and ""studio live"" performances that pretty much span the band's career. There are some rough spots here and there - Burke's voice is rough in places & there is some typical sonic degradation - but that kind of goes with the territory when you're dealing with recording from the 70's. The mid-70's performances benefit greatly from the inclusion of a second gutairist, the band's breaks and jams are just terrific, at times. Budgie fans - you've got to hear the John Peel show version of ""In the Grip of a Tyrefitter's Hand"" (track 6) - it will blow you away and convert the unitiated, it's that good. If you, like myself, never had a chance to see the band, this will give you a good idea of what they were probably like live."
3,stark raving catholic,"I love huysmans but I don't know if I will finish this one. it's pretty dull. I think the biography of St Lydwine is far more interesting, if you want to get into some of this late huysmans catholic mania stuff. en route is totally enjoyable as well. but the cathedral is pretty hardcore and dry."

2,Not flush with wall,"One reviewer mentioned that the phone was not flush...but it really sticks out. It seems ""flimsey"". The phone bounces when you dial. It would be a great desk phone, but does not mount on the wall."
3,"Barely adequeate, but that's par for the course for corded phones these days","The display is barely readable, and it requires batteries. But it's still one of the best corded phones on the market. How sad is that. If I was willing to put up with a power adapter cluttering up the kitchen counter, I'd get a cordless phone. Next time, I will. But if you need a corded phone (wall or desk -- it can do both), this is the way to go."
2,Not very good as a wall phone,"I purchased this phone to replace a kitchen wall phone that had given me years of excellent service, unfortunately, even though this phone is listed for wall phone use, in order to get the receiver to remain in place when you try to hang it up it takes several tries to delicately balance the receiver on the hang up hook before it stays on the phone. Very, Very, annoying. I am now looking for a replacement phone. Oh, for the good old days of quality made products"
1,Nice phone...for three days.,"It's a nice phone with lots of features and I wanted a phone I can use if the power goes out. However, the mic in the handset quit working after three days. I RMA'd back to Amazon over two weeks ago and I'm still waiting for my credit."
1,Don't Use It As a Wall Phone,"First of all, I wanted a white phone. This phone is not white. It's like eggshell or linen. Secondly, I wanted a wall phone. It is constructed to be a wall phone as well as a desk phone, but don't believe you will ever be able to use it as a wall phone. I tried with all my might to mount the phone on the wall. The receiver will not stay on the hook, and the phone will move as you move, i.e., if you pick up the receiver and walk to the left, the phone on the wall will turn to the left. It might be a great eggshell, desk phone, but I cannot attest to that."
3,Panasonic Corded TSC11 Phone is Just OK,"This is a basic corded phone which works well and sounds fine but has a few drawbacks.1. It has no long memory so if the battery is removed, all stored numbers are lost.2. It has no speaker phone.3. If you hang it on the wall, the latch does not jut out very far so it tends to fall off the hook quite easily."
4,Phine Phone,"Panasonic has always made good solid phones, both wired and wireless--our house is full of them! This one is located on the kitchen wall where we specifically wanted a corded model in case of power failures. For this purpose, it works very well and is not cluttered with a bunch of features we neither need nor want. Sound quality is great. Just wish it had a backlit screen in case of, you guessed it, power failure. Otherwise, a very good buy with prompt delivery and good service overall."
2,Returned because of appearance,"This review is based on the looks of the phone - not on its function. Most importantly, this phone is not ""white"" - it is dingy off-white, almost putty-colored, which will not blend in with other white items. Secondly when the phone is wall mounted it doesn't cover the standard wall plate and protrudes awkwardly from the wall and plate (I think another reviewer mentioned this too); the line cord is also visable and doesn't tuck behind the phone like other wall-mounted phones do. If you are looking for a corded Caller ID that doesn't need A/C power, only consider this phone if you don't care about the color and about the wall-mount system. I'm sure that the sound quality is up to Pansonic standards but it is a very unattractive phone."
2,Wall kitchen phone,"I bought this phone as a wall phone to be hung on a wall in the kitchen. I needed a corded phone because I had no electrical outlet for a cordless phone. Unfortunately, when you hang up the phone in its cradle, the slightest touch or motion will make it fall from its hanging position. This phone was made to be placed on a horizontal surface as the plastic lip to hold it in place when you hang up the phone vertically, was poorly constructed and does not hold. It was a poor choice for that reason."
4,Good Value,"Very good corded phone. Easy to program. Phone book is retained even if the caller ID batteries die. Just what I was looking for, except that I didn't realize it's not a speaker phone when I purchased it. That's okay though, still a good buy."
4,good simple caller id phone,"I was looking for a simple phone for my workshop space that had caller id and this fit the bill.This phone is not too attractive when mounted on the wall, and it does not have a speaker phone option, but it's great if you're looking for a simple caller id phone without frills."
3,good phone,There doesn't seem to be much of a choice in wall corded phones. This one works well and my only complaint is that the receiver does not stay put on the phone when it is wall mounted. It falls off when not seated just right. The caller ID is easy to read.
5,The folks need a new phone - please,"My parents had a very old phone in their kitchen that needed replacing and my dad's fingers where too big for the cordless ones.For the price, this phone has worked out beautifully and it includes a speaker phone option.Very sturdy as well."
5,Good phone,"I love this Panasonic phone because it does not have lights blinking and odd noises barking from the phone as my other more expensive phone did. Great to not have to plug in an electric cord so short it limits where the phone can set up. The keypad is not supersensitive to the touch and cause me to press a number too many times! Just plain nice to use this simple phone that ironically costs less than the AT&T phone!Very happy I bought this Panasonic phone. Oh, and the audio quality is better than the more elaborate expensive phone. While browsing for phones I notice that many phones have far too many Buttons"
2,Cheap looking -,"The receiver falls off easily and is hard to put back on. The phone on the wall has a big ugly gap. It is overall a cheap phone, however since I don't use the landline much, it suits its purpose."
1,not a good wall phone,"When hung on the kitchen wall plate,the phone tilted away from the plate and whenever you would pick up the receiver, the phone came off the wall."
4,Like it,"Nice not to have a glowing time staring at you in the middle of the night. I like the way this one works. Glad I bought it. Easy to use, like the features."
2,Wouldn't have bought if I could have seen a demo.,"The handset is really cheap. Feels like I'm holding a toy to my ear. All the phone's features are driven by a digital display (like digital watches have). Anyways, it's hard to read; I think my watch's display is bigger. Also there's no backlight so you can't read it in the dark.The biggest reason I bought this phone is because I switched to my phone company's voicemail system and had no way of knowing when someone left me a message. This phone does have an indicator on the display that you have a message. It's a little envelope icon that's about the size of a pencil led. Very easy to miss.To sum up, this phone serves the purpose but it's not what I was hoping for."
1,Panasonic Corded Phone KX-Tsc11W,I found it awkward. Tone entry for number calling is weak. Just sub-standard device. I would not recommend it to anyone.
2,So-so drug story.,The Basketball Diaries starring Leonardo DiCaprio is a good film about drug abuse but this coming of age drama left me disappointed. DiCaprio is so talented but even his electric performance can't save this dribble. This is a movie you borrow or rent but not buy.
1,not wrapped in bubble wrap ruined the case,it was not wrapped in bubble wrap. i will never order from you again.. the case was in very bad shape... i am keeping it because i love the movie and wanted to watch it as soon as i got it...
3,Leo,Leo is wild in this movie. The blu-ray release seemed random but Leo is a star so why not. The gf had a crush on the guy so I bought this to satisfy my need for edgy cinema while entertaining the misses
2,Basketball Diaries,This film came highly recommended but I personally was disappointed. It wasn't all disappointing but I didn't experience it as deeply as I thought I would.
3,"not worthless, not great","This strengths of the movie are: competent acting by DeCaprio and a socially useful message: drugs ruin dreams and lives.In the movie, DeCaprio is not a bad basketball player; he has plenty of coordination. However, he is not even close to the type of high school athlete who in real life would be in line for a college scholarship. He lacks the necessary muscle mass and skill development to even be considered for that level. So the way the movie ends up looking: the ""dream"" of being a college player (or beyond) was only in his mind. Bad casting. He's a fine actor but this was not the right role for him.The scenes take place without much development so that the movie has more of a comic book feel than a serious movie."
5,Like,"I bought this even though I can netflix it because if I ever lose internet I want to still be able to watch this movie, because it just wowed me."
1,Read The Book!,"Check out the book. It will take you about an hour to read and has eveything the movie lacks - namely humor, drama, intelligence, a modicum of authenticity and entertainment value. Might make a good investment for the most rabid (and brain dead) Leo fans out there."
5,The Bomb Digity,This was one of the best movies that I have ever seen! Leo played a really good role! But he did better in Titanic and Romeo&Juliet! Well I recommend that you see this movie or read this book! The book stunk after you have seen the movie! JUST SEE THE MOVIE! END
5,Fantastic,"Before Trainspotting their was The Basketball Diaries and a brilliant film it is too. This is a great production from Scott Kalvert.It is the harrowing story of how a young basketball hopeful named Jim Carrol, whos life is descending into a life of drugs and violence.In which the only thing that keeps him going is his diary which is later named The Basketball Diaries.The acting in this film is brilliant.An absoloutely brilliant film it has no flaws.Every aspect of this film is great.A true masterpeice."
5,The Honest Truth,Most of these people on here that wrote reviews have no idea what they are talking about.This movie was great and anybody that has been in the place of Leo's chatacter knows how well this movie was made.Anybody that has never done the things that go on in this movie might not understand the way drugs take over your life.All the characters play good parts but Leo's acting when he is kicking heroin is the best i have seen yet and the most accurate.I give this movie two thumbs up and highly recommend buying it.
4,Good,"I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. It was a cold and bitter portrayal of someone who nearly loses their life to junk. It was disturbing, which is good. Leonardo played his role to a T. The only confusing thing with this movie is the fact that I don't know who the hell Jim Carroll is. I wouldn't know him if he walked up to me and slapped me in the face."
5,Brilliant insight into a tormented writer.,"Writers' lives aren't always easy, as this film represents in all its realism and unashamed detail of life on the streets and conflict with drugs and sex. I study this film to see how I can help those who are lost in all aspects of life. Leo is great. This is one of those films not fit for all tastes."
2,This could be an after school movie,"If you want a movie to show that drugs are bad, this is it. Otherwise, it's just not that great a movie. Yes, Leo does a good job of portraying someone who just about throws his life away, but the movie just didn't draw me in. I realize it's a true story so there's not a lot you can do with it, but there wasn't a single character I cared about."
4,The Basketball Diaries: Inspiring in a way,"Leornardo Di Caprio plays Jim Carrol in this movie. He's young,famous and a great basktellball player. Between things, he writes a book daily or whenever he can. He suffers from depression when his best friend dies of cancer. Then on, he adopts drugs and ruins his high school life.The movie is quick and the screenplay is hard hitting and incredibly entertaining. The most gulp inducing scene in the film features Jim crying outside his mom's appartment before getting arrested. It always strikes me how Di Caprio has this superhuman side to him. He can undertake any role you throw at him. The end of this movie was heartening and inspiring in a way.My other favourite Leonardo Di Capro films are Aviator (absolute 5 starrer) Catch Me If You Can (of course you've seen it) and Titanic(overrated? hell no) He also happens to be my favourite actor besides Tom Hanks.Overall rating for Basketball Diaries,7/10"
5,It was the most honest movie I have ever seen.,"I am extremely upset that this movie has been recalled. It is a hopeful and inspiring story, not meant to be about killing. It renewed my faith in the strength of the human spirit, Jimmy's story is truely amazing!"
2,"Bad, boring","Please don't overrate this movie. It was so boring. Leo is a great actor yes, he was the only good thing in the movie. But the story was so sloppy and sleep-provoking. I can't believe Jim Carroll would let such a bad movie like this portray his life."
1,Awful,"Bad, bad, bad.Bad acting, bad writing, bad directing.I was sort of neutral about DiCaprio until I saw this steaming pile of bad acting. Consequently, since seeing this, I haven't voluntarily watched another DiCaprio performance.It was a huge mistake by the director (or the screen writer) to NOT set this in the era in which Jim Carroll grew up. Or if it was meant to be, it failed astoundingly with glaring anachronisms."
5,An strong unique drama on the world of Drugs.,"Based on a true story on the life of the early gritty world of Poet and Author:Jim Carroll (Leonardo DiCaprio), a Catholic-School basketball players, who draws himself on the World of Drug Addiction, it`s becomes Nightmarish until he finds Redemption.Directed by Scott Kalvert (Deuces Wild) made a strong believable film with Terrific Performances from the Cast, Including-Lorraine Bracco, Mark Wahlberg, Ernie Hudson, Bruno Kirby, Patrick McGaw and James Madio. This film was a Box Office Flop but it gained a Cult Success on Video. Grade:A."
5,a movie one MUST OWN!,"this movie is simply exelent! it's intresting for adolecents to see... so i think that parents should give their children the chance to see this movie. it does get violent at times but it all ends up with the viewers swearing they'll never do drugs. it's not just a movie to entairtain, it's a movie to EDUCATE in the world our children are going to live in!..."
4,A POWERFUL MOVIE,"A depiction of the degredation and violence that can be associated with drug abuse can bring about, I thought this film was remarkable in its presentation of the anti drug message. Compare this with what often seems like the soft spoken mildness of the ""just say no"" approach.For reasons that elude me, many often ranted and raved against this movie. After the dreadfully awful Colorado shootings, for example, their seemed to be a desire to absolutely demolish the picture."
5,Captivating and gripping,"The Basketball Diaries blew me away. Not only was the story moving and gripping, but the acting was also quite good. It demonstrates what really happens when you get caught for hustling, and hooked. it was very real and very well done."
5,Ricky is Great!,I purchased Ricky for my 6 year old son. Ricky says the names of several sports in English and Spanish plus other phrases a boy would say. My son says Ricky is his best buddy. We are very pleased! Thanks for a great product! I am now going to purchase Lizzie Speaks Spanish for my 6 year old niece.
4,Great Doll,This is a great educational doll. Especially if you have someone spanish speaking that is close to your child. My 4 year old really likes this doll and loves to hear the phrases in english and spanish.
2,Verbal Self-Congratulations,"Essentially the point of this book is to assert that hosting web pages for yourself and your friends creates its own secondary income streams. This book, for example, which the writer self-published and marketed through Amazon. It's encouraging to learn that self-publishing is actually a relatively worthwhile pursuit here in the twenty-first century, but it's not terribly useful to someone looking for a nuts-and-bolts account of web-hosting -- which is ostensibly what the book is about. Rah, rah, Chris; thrilled to hear it's working out so well for you, but I've got a life too. See you around."
2,Not very helpful,"I was looking for a book about web hosting, however, this provides little information. It is a VERY basic guide - mostly about business, little about web hosting."
3,Nice background info,"Got this to prepare for teaching seminary. It's an old textbook or Sunday School book, I think. Not an exciting read, but lots of good information."
1,picture doesn't match what i got,"Although I like what I received, and it will do the job, it is not what I ordered. I ordered this round product.... that is the picture shown. What I received was a square platform with two blue nonslip patches. There is no name anywhere on the rocker I received."
4,The Wrong Song Clips,"I owned this album on vinyl when it was new. I wanted to hear the song clips here to think about getting it back into my collection. I saw Oregon in concert four times in the 70's and 80's. I have to tell you that these song clips are NOT from this album. I remember enjoying the music that is actually from this album: Navigator by Paul McCandles; however, this is not it. If I pay to download the music I'm afraid that I would not be getting the right music, so I guess it's a no-go. I hope that this gets corrected. Then I could recommend getting the album."
4,Love poems,"I've not finised reading this book yet, but I've enjoyed what I've read so far. I will write full review upon completion."
2,Is this a trance CD or a Ministry Of Sound Annual?,"If this is supposed to be a trance CD, then there better be some TRANCE on it. If I wanted a house or dance CD, I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT ONE!! But I wanted a trance CD, I paid for a trance CD, and there was only a handful of trance on it! I'm not saying that I don't like house or dance, I'm just saying that I don't want it on a trance CD! Johnny Vicious should just stick to making the other thrivemix CDs and leave the trance compilations to someone who knows what they're doing. A major dropoff from the first which I thought was great. Yeah, there was a few trance tracks on it, but hardly any of them could be considered ""anthems"". The only thing keeping this from receiving 1 star was the few good house, trance, and dance tracks on it. Disappointing."
2,His last cd was much better.,"This new disc.........I don't know, he changed his music style too much. I was gonna buy it, but now now, NO WAY."
2,"Disappointing follow up to ""I Get Wet""","Andrew W.K.'s debut ""I Get Wet"" was a mindless, back to the basics hard rock album that brought back fond memories of good 'ol headbanging metal; but his follow up, ""The Wolf"", is a disappointing, derivative, and repetitive album at best. The whole party hard vibe seems more like a shtick this time around (and maybe it has been all along) and it wears thin very quickly, especially the first time you hear ""Long Live the Party"". We even get to hear Andrew do a ""touching"" ballad called ""Never Let Down"", which sounds suspiciously like an 80's power ballad left off a Poison album, and the whole song just comes off as lame. While ""The Wolf"" does have it's moments here and there, it is ultimately better to leave this one on the shelf."
1,ZERO STARS,I'm disappointed I can't rate it a zero. Andrew WK sucks hard. Don't even download this album for free.
2,wait a second,"hmmmmm... this sounds vaguely familiar. if i remember correctly Def Leopard made this exact album god knows how many times. Aslo if i remember correctly Def Leopard was TERRIBLE. anyone who says that Andrew WK is fun isnt wrong. Still, youre neglecting the fact that music can be both fun and creative at the same time. All you guys can have your one note piano solos but when it comes time for me to party, I'm gonna be dancing to Hot Hot Heat."
2,"man, what's going on????","Look, I am a huge Andrew WK fan. I've seen him in concert the last two times he's been in town, and I think his music and everything is amazing, but I don't know what he was thinking on this album. Long gone is the hardness, and hitting sound of I Get Wet, and in are slowness and bad melodies. I don't know what's going on here, but come on Andy, go back to the old stuff man."
5,The Wolf,"I went out into the shops the morning this came out before I'd read any reviews or heard anything of this album, purely off the hype of I Get Wet. And The Wolf lives on and ever increases the hype behind his name. The Wolf relives the energy and the hedonistic philosophies with catchy lead riffs and happy keyboard jingles! Either love it or hate it, the Wolf will definately leave a lasting impression on anyone."
5,Andrew WK The Wolf,"I wasnt really a fan of Andrew's until this album came out. I love this album. IF you want to hear great music dont let this album pass you by. My favorite song Never Let Down, he put his heart and soul in this CD and let his true self out. You can tell this CD came from his heart.One thing that he is doing is calling his fans who buys this CD which I think is great. I have never heard of anyone doing this before. So I think that would tell you he loves his fans. So go and order this CD and register the code on the web and get on his call list."
4,different more mature but still good,this cd is packed with the same amount of crazy go nuts good times but at the same time this cd is very different yes at first it is a little strange but then you see how it is still very much of andrews style of writting so have fun party til you puke and never let down... peace
5,Another Blockbuster from Andrew WK,"The Wolf, the latest album from Andrew WK will not dissappoint his fans. The man is a genius of party rock, and it shows on his sophomore album. Andrew WK may very well be a new breed of musician. A musician who loves his fans, no matter what age, and with no cussing on this album it is appropriate for all ages."
5,Different yet the same,"when i picked up this album, i was hoping for another insane set of songs following in the veign of ""i get wet"". some songs do and some do not. songs like ""long live the party"" ""your rules"" and ""free jumps"" are manic and floor you like his older stuff, but on songs like ""totally stupid"" ""i love music"" and ""never let down"" he proves that he really does know what he's doing. those songs are moving and totally (not stupid) uplifting. definetaly the ""feel good album"" of the year, if thats not too john tesh for ya. the cd is quality and ups the anty on his past album, and brings a new feeling of sofistication and meaning to his music and live shows, while still remaining the ultimate party animal."
3,"3-1/2 stars -- I defended his first album, but...","Being a fan of Andrew W.K., I praised his first album. But I can't necessarily do the same thing for his latest album, The Wolf. Not that it isn't a good album, but you really can't tell the difference between a lot of these songs. In fact, you could play a song like ""Your Rules"" and not be able to tell whether it's from this album or I Get Wet.All arguments aside, this album has its moments in songs like ""The End of Our Lives"" and especially ""I Love Music"". But there are also some missteps, like the corny ""Make Sex""; and ""Victory Strikes Again"" has more music than actual singing. And as for ""Really In Love"", please, Andrew, no more power ballad attempts.It's too bad that this album isn't selling very well, and Andrew's show on MTV2 didn't really do much for publicity either (I'm not even sure if that show still comes on). While not the most creative of records, The Wolf is still good to listen to for a tremendous rush of energy.Anthony Rupert"
3,Different but still Andrew WK,"No where near as fast paced, fist pumpring, head banging his debut was; but you can still hear the man behind the mic.You can tel he wanted to go in another direction, make a name for himself rather than a party anthem rocker.A nice listen to, but not like the previous!"
5,Happy!,"Happiness and positivity emit from Andrew constantly, and listening to this album will do the same to the listener. It's so full of happy!"
4,Different BUT Good,"Ok, so it's not I Get Wet, but it's still pretty cool. The songs are not the same party, drink, and head banging like before. However, the songs are slightly different and I think he tries to generate a different type of sound and style. My advise to all who have never listened to Andrew W.K. before is to pick up I Get Wet and then buy The Wolf. As for those who have I Get Wet, pick up a copy of The Wolf and listen to it 2 or 3 types and you will love it."
3,"Slightly disapointing, but still good","This album is not what I was expecting. While ""I Get Wet"" was mostly about partying, ""The Wolf"" has only one song about parties. Most of the songs are slower, and feature the piano, unlike ""I Get Wet"" which was more guitar based. Most songs are in the style of 80s power ballads. Die hard fans will enjoy it, but miss the speed and rockin' riffs from his first album. Its still good, just try not to compare it to ""I Get Wet"" if you can."
1,Books That Drive Me Crazy,"This book was quite possibly the most unhelpful professional text I have ever read (and I have read a lot). The examples are cliched and overwrought; the suggestions are simplistic at best - ridiculous at worst. (For example: p. 118 Teacher: ""What I'm try to say Mrs. Whittaker, and I'm not saying it very well, is that my job is to help you do your job better. I have it easy - I only deal with your child a few hours a week, but you have to live with him. I'm wondering what I can do to help you."") Who would really say such a thing to a parent? I can't imagine much that would offend and alienate a parent more than that!A colleague and I both ordered this book so that we might do a book study and work together to improve the behavior of a few students who are of concern to us. At our first book discussion we both realized this book did not meet our needs. I regret the time I spent reading this book as it could have been better spent on most anything else."
3,okay,I didn't find anything earth shattering in this book that I didn't know already. It is okay for a few suggestions but basically the premise is treat everyone respectfully etc...
5,One of my favorites,"I love Ana Gabriel, but this album shines head and shoulders above her other efforts. The guitar playing on this album displays the power of Mexican guitar and is reminiscient of the playing of such legends as Trio Los Panchos. I have always enjoyed her singing style and it often is pained at just the right moments of the song, which adds a lot of depth and color. Many of the songs are classics, but she has some originals as well that seamlessly fit in with the classics. This is one my grandmother and I could have listened to together!"
5,Love,"Ana Gabriel sings beautiful bolleror's. She has a beautiful voice and would order alot more of her music. Love her sound of her voice, very emotional."
5,OUTSTANDING,"As much as I love ANA GABRIEL, this album is OUTSTANDING even by her standards. The music is soft, pleasant, and acoustic guitar driven. Every song is a brilliant gem, and beautifully produced. The vocals are a little toned down relative to most of her work, but it complements the music beautifully. When it comes to singing, she's been blesses and anointed by God himself. If you are an Ana Gabriel fan, and don't have this album, don't hesitate any longer. If you are interested in Ana Gabriel, and want to buy your first album, you can't go wrong with this one.I would actually rate this a 6 on a scale of 1 to 5, but that wasn't an option."
2,this is not a 15 amp timer,"All the info at Amazon calls the SA220 a 15 amp timer, no exclusions that I could see online. However, when the timer arrived, info on the timer states that for tungsten/incandescent use, it is only rated at 5 amps. This makes it a lot less useful. It is also a pain to program, the claim is you just set the area code and go. This is not true, you also have to set the day, month, year, and time. The batteries in the unit were nearly dead also and of course they are not standard size batteries. You are better off getting a cheaper, photocell digital timer for holiday lighting, there are some rated 10 amps tungsten/incandescent."
5,easy historical mystery read,"This seven-story anthology focuses on the life of Easy Rawlins as he tries to serve as a role model for his two kids, be faithful to his sweetheart, and stay off the streets of 1964 Watts. Six of the tales were included one at a time with the recent releases of the first six Mouse novels. Yet in spite of the not long ago reissues of these tales, fans will relish seeing them along with one new story in this book though cost should be considered. As always the cast including the allegedly dead Mouse makes Walter Mosley's contributions so much fun to read. SIX EASY PIECES is an easy historical mystery read.Harriet Klausner"
4,A great series!,"Six Easy Pieces is the second book of Walter Mosley's Easy Rawlins mysteries that I have read. I know that I am late in the series, but I love the character Easy Rawlins. I will read the other books in the series at some point. You are either a fan of the series or you are not and for those of you who are and want to know what happened to Mouse Easy's bet friend you should pick up Six Easy Pieces and find out in the six short stories.Reviewed by AieshaOf The Detroit-RAWSISTAZ"
4,Walter Mosley - Six Easy Pieces,"CDs / Product was a good price, quick shipping and overall good experience. I may have missed the fact that it was a used library copy. These have a tendency to be more abused and to have more scratches in the CDs and this one was no exception. So far though, CDs have been working fine.Thanks,"
5,Easy Rawlins,"Walter Mosley is a great writer, i have followed the Easy Rawlins series from devil in the blue dress. this book is a great sum up of the series to me."
2,"Great stories,well read but poorly packaged","These are wonderfully written and read stories. However, the CD's are very user-unfriendly. There is no way to tell where a particular story starts or ends. Most start in the middle of a disk with no audible chapter markers. If you import these into iTunes, you just get 7 chapters, broken up into about a dozen parts with great titles like 1a, 1b, ... 1m, 2a, 2b, ... etc. Not very informative or easy to use in a computer, car or player.Overall, I prefer the cassette tapes read by Paul Winfield. Better sound, better voice and a lot easier to use. It's actually easier to digitize from the cassettes than it is to import from the CD. That's not normally true, but in this case it is.Again, this are great stories and a good listen, but the product is poorly designed and hard to use."
4,Living with Lymphoma: A Patient's Guide,I found this book extremely informative. It is from a patients point of view and therefore very sensitive to the psychological element of dealing with the disease. The book is a one stop shop on Lymphoma for those of us who dont need all the medical jargon but would like to understand the words that are spoken to us by our physicians. I would highly recommend it to Lymphoma patients and to their families.
4,Great Book!,This book is a terrific idea for individuals recently diagnosed with Lymphoma. It provides plenty of very useful and direct information that can help cancer patients make vital life-changing decisions. There is also a very useful glossary and index in the back.
2,Disappointed,"Strictly as a resource, the book is okay, but I found much of it a bit deep in places and hard to follow. Since I was looking more for an alternative guide, this was not the book for me."
4,Truly informative,"Although there are a lot of technical/medical terms, I really enjoyed reading this book. I only wish it was available when I was diagnosed 5 years ago. The book helped explain some terms clearer than my doctors did, or maybe it was because I didn't have to try to remember everything, I could always go back and re-read a chapter or paragraph. I only hope my original treatment was sufficient to ""cure"" me and I won't need this information again in the future, but it is nice to know it is there and availble to me."
2,Less Than Thrilling,"As a lifetime resident of Louisiana, I have long loved the history of my state, as well as the superstitions that never die here. I am especially fascinated by the plantations and the stories of those that lived there. I was quite disappointed by Ms. Pascoe's book, as it completely failed to grab my interest or make my spine tingle. I spent much of the book wondering if the author was sponsored by the plantations, as the book reads like a brochure. Louisiana's plantations are well worth visiting, though some of the best ones with the most fascinating tales are left out of this book. However, I don't need a book of ghost stories to try to sell me on that. I would have enjoyed my read much more if it had focused more on the tales of hauntings and less on the available accomadations."
5,Inspiration for Anyone,Anyone will be inspired by this account of Lance Armstrong's life. This book teach you to have hope no matter what you are going through.
4,Inspirational!,"Lance provides a lot of insight into his life, who he is, and how he became the greatest cyclist in the world in this book! This book covers his life from birth to the 2nd Tour de France win. The dedication he has to his job (cycling) is so impressive. A truly inspirational story...."
5,What a true inspiration...,"I loved this book. My father was fighting pancreatic cancer for 1yr as I was reading this book. I never believed anything else than that my father would win his battle, and a year later he beat it. I'm an athlete and have also thought nothing could happen to me, because I'm healthy. But after reading Lance's battle, if it does...I'll fight it with everything I've got."
1,what a lie,Can we all get our money back? What a book full of lies. Why is this even published now? Good going Lance.
1,Pure fiction,"The events described in this book are mostly fiction. A true account would describe a mediocre cyclist who couldn't win a race without cheating. So he made it his life's work to be a cheater, liar and fraud. More like a gangster than a competitor, he bullied, attacked and sued anyone who dared speak the truth. He organized a drug ring within the U.S. team, so that his teammates would be as fraudulent as himself, and he would be able to keep them in constant fear of being exposed. There is no winning behavior in this story. It is a sad and vile tale of pathological liar corrupted by greed and evil. This is not about surviving cancer, it is about being a cancer."
1,Good read - but wrong subject area.,"This was filed under ""Sport"" and ""Biography"", but should instead be under ""Fiction"" and ""Fantasy"". Good read once you get that sorted."
1,liar,read this 10 years ago. what a liar he is. he used EPO and other performance enhancing drugs to win 7 titles. they were recently stripped from him. amazon please take this book off your shelves.
4,"Inspirational, well-told tale","Mr. Armstrong and his co-author have hit a home run with this inspirational story of the cyclist's life thus far. I thoroughly enjoyed this story and fully appreciate the fact that Mr. Armstrong was so kind as to share something so personal with his fans. Readers (as did I) will find this heartwarming, tearful, motivational and finally exultant, as the authors take you from his humble beginnings, through his near fatal bout with cancer, through remission and to victory in the world's toughest and most prestigious cycling event. Perhaps most enlightening about Mr. Armstrong is his consistent effort to give credit to those who helped him achieve his goals (i.e. his Mother, Wife, Team, friends, etc.) A must read!"
4,It IS about the bike - AND A LOT MORE!!!,"Great title! It's about the bike. It's about cancer. Recovery. Desire. Determination. It's about pain and suffering. Lance went through a hell of a lot and came out of it a champion.It's a book that must be read. To see a young man, an arrogant young man learn that he isn't indestructible is a learning experience not only for Lance but for the reader, because there are a lot of people out there who think that they are going to live forever.This book allows the reader to reflect on his/her life. It shows the importance of relationships. The importance of being a good (make that excellent)single parent as Lance's mother was in bringing him up.I cannot say enough about it. Read it! I just finished it and plan to read it again now!"
1,A Liar and a Bully,"This book is a lie. Lance Armstrong cheated his way to 7 Tour wins and used his money, power, and fame to bully anyone who dared speak the truth about his drug use. I can get over the cheating and lying in a sport where most riders did the same. But the bullying is another issue. The bullying of former best friends, trusted colleagues, and others who literally gave their all to put Lance on the podium is despicable. This shows his true character and anyone in the press who continues to support him should take a good long look in the mirror."
3,Insightful look into the life of a professional cyclist,"The book gives an interesting view into the life of a professional roadracer and into Lance's own battle with cancer. His determination and will are most admirable. He gives hope to others, make that great hope to others and often hope is the only thing a cancer patient has. There were a couple of things about the book that were detractors. One was Lance's own self absorbtion which did not seem to change from his pre-cancer days and the other was the all to frequent use of the ""f"" word. I find it amusing that Lance found the porno magazines at the sperm bank offensive, but doesn't mind using crude sexual language in his own book."
3,TOO ARROGANT,"You know, I've always cheered for Armstrong in the races. I've always thought that he was a decent guy. Until I read this book. Lance Armstrong is a very, very cocky guy that seems to have some kind of anger deep inside that he keeps pinned up until he explodes. His comeback was amazing, his careeer is amazing, his cycling is amazing, but I don't care if he has won the Tour 5 times, he is still to arrogant for my liking."
2,Lance is still Lance,"I was diagnosed with testicular cancer on Jan 7, 2013. I had surgery the next day, and having no idea what to expect, bought this book. Before the Oprah confessional, I read this book hoping to gain some insight.By the second chapter, I determined it isn't about the bike. Rather, this book is about a super ego. This narcissistic autobiography must have made Lance feel better, but it does little more than stoke his own ego.He isn't a good guy. It comes through in his book- we did not need Oprah to bring this into the light of day. He does that on his own.The book title must be truncated: ""It isn't about the the bike, it's about me!"""
3,Mixed feelings before and after the truth came out,"I bought this book back in December, and even then I was ambivalent. It seemed to me that even if he did use drugs, the fact that he was able to overcome cancer and race in the Tour de France is inspirational. The book was indeed well-written and was a good story. He came across as a rather unlikeable guy, but still inspiring due to his drive to survive and come back. Now that he's made his confession, you'd really have to read a lot of this with a grain of salt. My recommendation (and my plan) is to find a good biography about him instead. My next order will be for ""Seven Deadly Sins: My Pursuit of Lance Armstrong"" by David Walsh."
5,Inspiration,The most inspirational book I have ever read! How can anyone not be moved by a story about a man that nearly died but instead found the will to live and will to win and dominate his sport.
5,What an amazing journey,I too have been faced with cancer and have fought my battle on the winning end. Lance Armstrong is such a strong athelete and I'm amazed by what he endured and accomplished after his treatments. This book is very real and I could feel his pain throughout his story. Loved this book! A good read for ANYONE.
5,Excellent story of the human spirit . . .,"Having been on on again/off again fan of the Tour de France and knowing who Lance Armstrong is from his win last year, I purchased this book during this years race and read it while avidly following his progress.Lance is not afraid to share the most intimate details of his experience with cancer and this book touched me in ways few books have in my lifetime. I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in sports and a place in their heart for the abilities of man to overcome any obstacle and achieve.I more fully appreciate the difficulty of bicycle racing and have more appreciation for the difficulties faced by those stricken with cancer having read this book. Well written, and thoughtful, even tear-jerking in spots, ""It's Not About the Bike"" has an important message for everyone. I highly recommend it."
2,It's not about the bike---It's about ME! ME! ME!,"A story of an incredibly egocentric, arrogant, selfish and immature man, who manages to haul himself up to the emotional level of a late-adolescent. And he's proud of it!"
3,Average,"Lance's story is truly incredible. It taught me too never give up or take no for an answer. Never lose hope. It is an especially great book for athletes, but anyone could draw inspiration from it. I did not, however, like the way Lance came off in the book. He seemed really cocky and self-centered. The book also was not very well written. Overall, this book was very inspirational and thought-provoking but had the potential to be much much more.*This book may not be a good one for readers with particularly weak stomachs.**Some mature content and language is used in the book and may not be appropriate for younger readers."
5,Excellant !!,"I just finished the audio cassette version. Having recently gone through a cancer fight with my mother-in-law, I can relate to Mr. Armstrong's incredible struggle against the odds. His experiences with surgery, chemo, blood marker counts, all sounded so familiar. No one would blame him for giving up racing, but to come back and actually WIN the Tour De France...Lance is an inspiration to all cancer patients and their families, to never give up hope. Very well done, Mr. Armstrong."
5,Wonderful Book,"I started reading this book for an english project... but I loved the book. It was inspirational, and illustrated that anything is possible. He is an excellent writer, and because of the detailed descriptions given for all of the influencial people in his life I feel like I knew them myself. I highly recommend this book to anyone."
4,Tour De Lance,"As a kid, Lance had issues. He grew up on the wrong side of the Dallas tracks with a mother who coddled him. He played catch with flamming tennis balls, and terrorized the streets in his Camaro IROC. He nursed his grudges. But along the way he discovered a world class talent in endurance sports,(his VO2 rates are still the highest ever recorded at the Cooper Clinic)and began successfully competing in triathalons and bike races. Focusing his angry energy and prodigious talent on cycling, he became a world class champion. Then the cancer struck and Lance had a whole new battle to fight. It's Not About the Bike interested me because along with the great sports story, Lance reveals a lively intelligence and some real humility. He knows that fate played just as big a role in his life as his indomitable will. His book reads well and has a nice flow to it. I gave it four stars because while it is not a classic, it is certainly one of the better sports autobiographies around."
2,Agree with AS,"Before reading this book i felt as though Lance Armstrong was an amazing man-overcoming cancer, wining the tour de france 6 times. As i began the book i still symapthised for him, but as i read further it came apparent to me at how conceited mr amrstong is. Anytime he lost it was alywas to ""the best in the world"" and ""he had given his absolute best and there was nothing he could do"". It seems as tohught he cant admit his faults. With all his talk aobut his wife and how amazing she was, why did he divorce her? Lance armstrong, while achieving great things, is exactly like many other sports stars- slefish and way too self-involved"
4,Inspirational!,"This book is a great read and Lance is quite an inspiration.. and yes, he can be slightly arrogant at times..but we all have our faults. I read this book in a day and have since reccommended it to family/friends. You won't be disappointed!"
3,"Good read........., and more cycling stories needed","Lance Armstrong's book has many words written about his fight on cancer. It has also detailed descriptions about how the disease affected his life and his perspective of life. It is well-written in a very direct way which can be very inspirational and emotional to readers. This book scores well from the inspirational side, especially on how he recovered from the disease.For cycling enthusiast who would like to know about his Tour de France races and conquest, there are about 50 pages of stories, with scant reference to other cycling greats like Indurain, Zuelle, Escartin etc. How I wish it were more detailed and more references because this are the parts which are most exciting to read.At the end of the day, many of us know Lance as a cyclist and this is what we like to look forward in his next book........"
4,I reveled in reading Lance's story.,"I'm a student from NYC Technical College. I study English as a second language and in this semester our teacher picked this book. < It's not about the bike> By: Lance Armstrong. I think she made a good choice for the class because some times we read together, we shared ideas, and we enjoyed reading this book. My opinion about Lance is that he is a perfect example for others with any obstacles in their lives. Lance fought against his cancer and emerged with victory. He won his dreams because he won the Tour de France. He had a second chance in his life and he was approaching this opportunity. I want to see him racing his bike again in a competition. Maybe I will read his second book if he writes another and follow his new life with his wife and his son. I encourage others to read this book based on real life and how he won the fight: "" Lance vs cancer ""."
3,It's About the Voice,"I had great hopes for this book, but low expectations given the quality and content of most athlete's stories (""I was abused/unsponsored/hated/injured but I won/almost won and learned a life lesson at the Superbowl/Olympics/World Champs"").I was pleasantly surprised by the readabilty, human focus and voice of this book. The first chapter is gripping, and clearly establishes the ""this is who I am, no apologies necessary"" tone. Even though you know how this story plays out, it's told with enough insight and detail to make it interesting. The recognition of growth moves this book a couple of notches above the standard self-congratulatory sports fare.Some phrasing is repetitious; ""X was great; they were there when I needed them"" appeared a few too many times (I get the idea! Lance was well supported by a close circle of friends!). If you can *tolerate* writing that's not high-brow, this is an entertaining read."
3,"3.5 stars for compelling, inspirational, tepidly written","you can't fight lance's compelling story: fatherless small town texas kid becomes champion bicycle racer, then is diagnosed with cancer -- a death sentence he eludes to win the tour de france over and over again. the story is certainly inspirational and benefits from lance's simple, frankly expressed emotions. however i'm only giving it 3 stars: 1. the writing is really flavorless and only picks up momentum at a few moments, lance could have really used a writer who cared; 2. with the benefit of hindsight, and with sheryl crowe now ""decorating"" his arm, a lot of the lovey-dovey about his wife seems like a lot of yap; 3. lance defending himself on performance-enhancing drug charges still sounds like bill clinton talking about marijuana and sex. at the end of the day this is a nice enjoyable read, good for an airport or vacation, but for REAL inspiration try lansing's Endurance, or papillon, or we die alone, or.."
4,A Strong Guy,"Lance Armstrong was a very strong and intelligent guy. He was a smart person and a bicycle rider. He never gives up for anything, even though he got sick, and he stood to fight with the disease. His cancer drove him crazy, and Lance beat it in his body. He was a cancer survivor , and he had a lot of energy to fight with it. Even though he knew it was a strong disease, he wasn't scared of it, and he believed someday he will be healthy again, ride the bicycle, and do activities he did before."
4,THE RIDE OF A HEART,"This experience is about our life with an illness, like cancer. It teaches us, how we have to fight when we get problems in our lives, but the most important thing it teaches us, is that, there's nothing in the all world we can't fight, when we got the strength to keep our life the way we want it. This book teach me that I have to continue fighting for my ideals and my hopes about life, and never give up when the obstacles stop you, during your live. Keep fighting, this is the beginning of the rest of our lives."
5,CAPTIVATING AND DIFFICULT TO PUT DOWN!,"As a cyclist, I followed the tragedy of cancer and the triumph in the Tour de France of Lance Armstrong closely. Fortunately, this book has so much more detail of the true struggle he, his friends, and family faced during the days, weeks, months and years following his diagnosis with testicular cancer. The openness about his fears and how he overcame them make this book a volume of encouragement to anyone facing severe illness. Cancer definitely ""picked the wrong body to live in"" and Lance's own words will show you why. The book has just enough cycling jargon for the non-cyclist to understand what he is talking about, but not so much that it reads like a technical guide to cycling. An exceptional book, easy to read and hard to put down. I read mine in 3 days."
4,It's Not About the Bike:My Journey Back to Life,Inspirational. His journey back to life was indeed a rough one. My focus was on his illness and his road to recovery. It was truly not about the bike for me.It was a good read.
2,Beware of offensive language and adult subject matter,"This book chronicles bicyclist Lance Armstrong's battle with cancer and his return to professional bicycle racing. Lance Armstrong is a 4-time winner of the Tour de France, husband, father and most importantly a cancer survivor.The book is very interesting, but does include offensive language."
3,A Modern-day Hero Tells His Story,"First off, this is a great story of how grim determination and luck beat the odds against the Big C and reached accomplishments far beyond the normal person's dreams. I can't imagine anyone not being inspired by LA's tale and happy for him & his family. On the down side, LA's ego also appears to be world-class and as sometimes seems the case in autobiography, he tends to take every chance to point out instances where he is superior. I would have rated the story much higher had it been written by a third party, but at any rate, the Armstrong story is terrific. Good luck at the 2001 TDF, Lance!"
1,Give me a break,"As an amateur triathlete, I couldn't wait to read Lance's story. I was eager to delve into the mind of one of my heroes, hear how he survived cancer and became a legend. Boy was I disappointed! This poorly written, extremely repetitive book had me cringing early on from the style; it was easy to see the book had been hastily published and hadn't received the editing attention it deserved. And the content! Armstrong reveals himself not as a noble, courageous human but rather a selfish jerk. I expected inspiration from reading this book but didn't take that away at all. Part of it could be my recent cancer experience, and part could be that my expectations of Lance were simply too high. Nevertheless, I no longer see him as an athlete or an example-- he's just another jerk who's good at his job."
3,"Elite cyclist, mediocre book","Based on all of the fabulous reviews, I purchased this book in its used state. It was worth reading, but it is not a great book. The story is honest and miraculous, but lacks sentimentality. The quality of writing appeals more to the average cyclist than the average reader, with lots of slang fragmented sentences and intentional arrogancy. I find that annoying, but you may not. I race and love Lance, plus I'm glad I read it, because I now know the story. Not a great read."
1,Lies?,No it isn't about the bike. We know that now don't we. Not much point in reading this now can I have my money back.
5,Couldn't put it down,"As an avid fan of bike racing, I thought I knew Lance's story pretty well. Turns out that what I didn't know is far more interesting than what I did know. I read the book in two sittings. I just couldn't put it down."
3,"He's a hero, but, uh ... it IS about the bike","Mr. Armstrong is a world-class athlete and champion, and he battled back from a deadly disease that should have taken his life. He's highly disciplined in a manner I can scarcely imagine and he regularly engages and overcomes adversity. He is an inspiration to all and especially to those in the throngs of cancer.What does not work is this underlying pretense epitomized with the book's title. He is only about the bike, or rather himself. Every other character in the book seems to be an object he can manipulate or castigate. Of course, he is no different from any other successful athlete, businessman, or president... Such success requires an intense, self-absorbed focus.I recommend this book for the inspirational value, but be prepared for the surface sentiments and contradictions."
4,Allez Lance!,"As a cyclist (aggressive tourist) I follow the cycling culture. Of course, a book by/about Lance Armstrong would be on my list. While watching the 2000 TdF I finished reading about the 1999 TdF.Lance had a hard but interesting youth. His bouth with cancer was a life changing experience. There is enough detail about the chemo and what happened to make anyone realized how unusual his recovery and subsequent victory in the TdF are.Pain, trial and tribulation can either destroy or make an individual. Lance was made through this trial by chemo. There are lessons there for all of us.Note: Sally Jenkins does and excellent job of telling Lance's story in a creditable manner that pulls no punches and can lead you to tears."
3,Honest and inspirational,An honest and inspirational account of Lance Armstrong's struggle and triumph over cancer. Armstrong speaks candidly about all of his fears and struggles he experienced in the face of the ultimate defeat: death. I was a bit disappointed that through all the pain and personal growth he hung on to the anger he felt from childhood toward his biological as well as adopting fathers. He also hung on to anger from petty insults; I found that side of him very off-putting.I totally agree with Armstrong's assessment that winning any struggle whether cancer or Tour de France is not about the physical strength but about the heart.Armond Mehrabianamehrabian@portofinosolutions.comTwitter: @armond_m
5,Inspiration,"I have a new value for athletes and cancer survivors! This book has made me want to take better care of myself and set out to get my body and better shape so if I ever have to face cancer, I will be able to fight it myself!"
5,If you ever get a second chance in life ....,"Phenomenal! One of the best books I have ever read. Not only extraordinarily inspirational, but also extremly informative and interesting. I don't think you can walk away without a thirst for more after reading this book. Lance is a winner in the truest sense of the word, and the writing is straightforward and honest. No punches are pulled - the good, the bad and the ugly are all dealt with. His triumph is truly exhilarating, and can serve as inspiration for us all in trying times. ""If you ever get a second chance in life for something, you've got to go all the way."""
5,A truly unique book,"I had heard good things about this book and picked it up to keep me company on an airplane. I knew nothing about cycling, and a little bit about Lance Armstrong, cancer survivor, TdF winner, etc. I didn't expect much. WOW. This book blew away my expectations. His story is incredible and an inspiration. Last year, we lost my fiancee's daughter to cancer and are familiar with the roller coaster cancer will put you on. The thing that kept this book so entertaining was the tone of it. This book could have been a conversation with Lance about what he'd been up to the past few years. It's a very light read given the heaviness of the subjects (cancer, chemo, childbirth). I have given this book (in audio) as a gift to my dad. That's how much I enjoyed it."
4,Good quick easy read,"Essentially two books in one. One is about Lance's cancer, and the surgeries and treatment of that cancer -- especially concerning chemo. If you don't know what chemo treatments and the suffering associated with this procedure is...then this part of the book will certainly open your eyes. Very informative, and readable. The other part of the book is about professional bicycling and more specifically -- The Tour de France, and Lance's wins of that tour. And though he could have detailed professional cycling more so for the reader; he does give enough overview of team racing and of the Tour, and the techniques utilized to race it -- certainly enough to whet anyone's interest to learn more. You don't have to be into bike racing to enjoy this book. Just the information concerning cancer is enough to make this a valuable read."
2,very shallow view of the world,"Very disappointed...The book was recommended to me as a deep book on his life changing event....although a very powerful story I found it very shallow and with very little deep meaning and it leaves you understanding how his ego led to his marital affairs,divorce and abandoning his family...."
2,Disquieting,"Lance Armstrong had all of the experiences and had developed all of the tools to become a great athlete and full blown narcissist. Had cancer not intervened, his views of himself and of the role of those around him might have become even more aggrandized than they did in real life.His loving and lovely wife we can see was the ultimate support mechanism, very little is spoken of what he gave to her other than the once in a lifetime chance to be with himThere is a good story about dealing with cancer and how it has the potential to change one but in his case not enough.The history of the last decade has confirmed what the book foretold"
5,What an amazing athlete,"It is easy to see why Lance has been so successful in his life. He has an amazing capacity for attacking any obstacle that gets in his way, whether it be cancer or the French alps. As a fellow cancer survivor, I could so relate to his battle. Mine was not as advanced as his was, and many times I felt like just giving up. I cannot imagine having to endure surgery, and chemo, and still managing to get on a bike. There are times when Mr. Armstrong comes across as arrogant and obstinate; probably what gave him the strength to persevere in the face of the naysayers who had already given him up for dead."
5,A lesson about life,"I red this book on a flight to Miami almost two years ago.It has became my bible: this is not about the bike at all. It's about the love of a single parent raising her only child facing so many challenges, it's about true friendship (something that is really hard to find nowadays...), it's about passion and efforts to reach a goal in one's life. It makes you think about how easly your life can change and you cannot avoid it, all you can do is find the energy to fight back as good as you can.I red this book over 25 times, I now it all. Forward and backward. And it still suprises me and I can still discover parts that give me a new impulse. It changed my life. I keep this book right beside my cupboard.And now I'm waiting for Lance's sixth victory.sabyne moras"
1,Fictional book by a doper,"This should be removed from Amazon's store...actually it shouldnt even be published any longer. Armstrong is a liar and scumbag. If you like fiction, buy this book."
4,The ultimate tale of overcoming the odds.,"Very few people will ever see the extreme lows and highs that Lance Armstrong has faced. Few fictional stories will ever be as unlikely as this true story. This book will remind you of what it is possible for a human being to accomplish.As a cyclist and long-time fan of Lance Armstrong, I found it interesting that I finished the book with even more respect for his accomplishments, but feeling like I wouldn't actually enjoy the man if I were to meet him. I see it as a credit to the writing and to Armstrong's openness in the book that I responded this way. (By the way, I fully acknowledge that he's well beyond needing to care one bit about what I think of him.)Highly recommended."
1,Was it about the Doping?,"Maybe the title of this book should have been ""It's Not About the Doping.""I bought this book for my mother, who was a Lance Armstrong fan, when the paperback was first published.After reading a few pages, wondering if I should invest in a copy for myself, I just couldn't get past the man's ego.If the stories hitting the news in the past few days turn out to be true, perhaps the man's overinflated view of himself will finally crash and burn along with his reputation.Somehow, however, knowing how these personalities self-justify their lives and actions, I doubt it.On the brighter side, I did learn something useful from reading a small portion of this bio; even someone who writes for the Washington Post can write poorly."
3,Lance Armstrong's lucky,"Quite an interesting account by the man who ought to know. Found Armstrong to be quite immature and narcissistic at times. However these features have added to the power of his winning method.Lance seems to forget that there are so many people who cannot jetset around America to find the Oncologist they think is best. Many people would not get extra help from Oncologists, etc. because they are NOT Lance Armstrong.Good luck to Lance, but I'm sure there are many other 'heros' who have faced greater odds and survived...."
1,DO NOT listen to the audio version with children present,"We bought this book on tape for a long road trip - thought it would be good inspiration/a good role model for our daughter; however, within minutes were exposed to foul language. I recuperated from that but before the end of side A of tape 1 were subjected to foul language 2-3 more times. I had to eject the cd and we listened to the radio for the remainder of the trip. It is a shame that we cannot be warned of these things in advance. I am not opposed to this type of language, per se, but I choose not to expose my daughter to it and am so upset at the lack of a warning, will probably never finish listening to the audiobook."
3,Moving &Touching...but not exactly a Literary Achievement,"To be perfectly honest, Lance Armstrong, has (with the help of Sally Jenkins) written a fine memoir about his recent battles (mostly bike races). His close call with cancer was extremely close and a heartwrenching, touching experience. I certainly feel for him. I used to be an avid cyclist, so I was quite interested in the book after a friend from Ireland (Paul Gourley) told me he loved the book. It's worth reading for anyone dealing with cancer or who loves bicycling. It's just not on my HIGH list as far as literary achievements go. If there's one thing I learned it's that Lance loves to WIN--no matter what the race/game/fight. Now I hear he's dating Sherly Crow, so I wonder what happened to 'the love of his life', the woman who had his child, Luke (wonders never cease as time goes by)."
3,Good biography,"Good easy read, you feel close to him during the book and I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys either cycling or has a connection to cancer"
5,It's About Human Existence,"I read this book over the past week after not knowing all that much about Lance Armstrong. I not only feel I ""know"" him now, but his struggle and triumph are truly inspirational. I am a clinical psychologist who works with people every day in an attempt to help them overcome the obstacles in their lives, both internal and external, and find true meaning and happiness. This book embodies one brave man's successful efforts to do this and to find and maintain his integrity as well. Without any ego or pretense, he describes what all of us aspire to learn about our lives and ourselves: that we can make of our time what we want to, that attitude is everything, and that the sweetest moments are often found with the perspective of loss or injury clearly in mind. I recommend this book to anyone who seeks common wisdom and understanding in their own life."
5,A wonderful surprise,"I bought this book to find out more about this brave person.I wanted to have an exceptionally brave role model in these trying times. At first, I was disappointed because the style of writing interfered with the content. It is choppy with very short declarative sentences. Then, as I continued, I realized that the confrontive style is a reflection of how he lives his life: focused and confronting the overwhelming adversities he faced.This is one of those books that sticks with you long after you've finished it. Don't be put off by the STYLE in which it is written. It is wonderful. He is so admirable. I'm glad he shared his perspective with us."
1,masterpiece of arrogance,"There are givers and there are takers in this world. This book clearly demonstrates that Lance Armstrong is a taker, both before and after his cancer treatment. It isinteresting to read only to have an inside view of an unabashed self-obsessed person."
2,Great Comeback - Mediocre Book,"I was hoping for more but this is a typical subpar athlete's autobiography. Lance's story is incredible because he fought and came back and should inspire those in a similar situation. However, other than the cancer, Lance Armstrong is not an interesting individual and reading about his mundane conversations with his wife was a waste of time and was out of place for subject of the book. It was very interesting to read that Lance does not love cycling - he did it because he was good at it and it was a well paying job. I can appreciate that kind of honesty."
3,Well written but a total lie,"At the time it came out, I found this to be a very good read. It is very well written and Lance is a very interesting individual. In and of itself, I think it's likely a 5 star autobiography.That said, recent developments established that it is pretty much complete fiction when it comes to Lance's training techniques and drug use. For that, I would give it a 1.By averaging the two out, I got a 3, which is what I rated the book."
3,"It's not about the bike, but...","It is about the money. I quite enjoyed this book until I got to the part where he refuses to work for the paltry sum of 120 K a year, three times what the average North American will ever earn. At that point the book is revealed for what it really is: a cynical marketing ploy designed to enhance his image amongst both cyclists and non-cyclists alike. Boo hoo. Poor Lance--he might not be able to buy back that Porsche."
1,Both Armstrongs need a dose of reality,"While i commend anyone who fights cancer, regardles of if they beat it, I was simply aghast at Armstrong and his wife. Pity poor Lance--he has to sell his Porsche! At one point, he moans that a sponsor is ""only offering $180,000 a year""--and this not to do anything, but simply as a gift while he trains. His wife, she's the real kicker here: she must ...Lance's sexism (he refers to his wife as ""a skirt""), his wife's vanity, all conspire to undermine the essentially valiant story of a man beating cancer and winning the hardest race on earth.I think his story deserved a biography; as autobiography, I simply found his persona too icky to root for. Maybe I am not ""stud""."
1,It is about a myth,"When I first read this book a year ago, I said ""Wow"". I mean, here's someone who beat a bad disease and did something tremendous. And the credit he gives to his wife for helping re-build the person after his sickness is inspiring.Until...Until you read that all of the sudden he's dumped his wife (oh, the woman in the book who ""is a stud""). Just like that. And running around with Sheryl Crow. That sucks. I've lost faith in this man. I think the book is just a story now, not what he really thinks or the way he really is. I am depressed and dissappointed, as someone who I used to think was inspirational is really just an egomaniac who gets a lot of press.It's not about the bike, but if it's about a life, at least make it a true life."
5,Sheer determination,"I wish more people had the will and determination to accomplish what Lance does after he is diagnosed with cancer. He was an good cyclist before he had cancer, but after he was done with the chemo treatments he became an EXCELLENT cyclist and an individual. Best of luck Lance!"
4,AN INSPIRING BOOK,"AN INSPIRING BOOK June 4 2002Reviewer: J.Alfonso Gutarra NY USAI am fascinated with the story of Lance; I used to follow the la tour de France all those years when Miguel Indurain was the winner. And I know this struggle to win those inches in the race, that why when I read this book I could imagine Lance's comeback, from lying in the hospital with cancer, going through the chemotherapy, facing the death and still keeping in the heart the idea of being a champion, That is amazing.No doubts than Lance is an"" extraordinaire"" person, who has a very candid relationship with every person in his world, blessed of a great physical and mental strength, and I think he is going to win again in those important races in Europe.This is an inspiring book for everybody. It is, about somebody who came back practically from the dead, somebody who never gave up. Also he is a classical winner, a beloved man, No only for his mother, and his friends everybody love Lance, He is a lucky man too."
5,Pure inspiration,"I rate this book five stars even though the quality of the writing should put it at a three and a half or four, because of the extraordinarily inspirational quality of the subject matter. It is a real-life fairy tale. If it had been fiction, I would have scoffed at the author's unbelievable ending (three Tour de France victories). But the fact that it is real, and true, leaves the reader with a sense of wonderment and a renewed belief in the power of an indomitable spirit to conquer the impossible.This book is gripping in all its phases: pre-cancer, cancer treatment, post-cancer doldrums, and the comeback. And the sports aficionado will not be disappointed: it includes wonderful stage-to-stage accounts of the Tour victories. It is a quick read and can be read in a few days.The writing can be clichéd at times, and the tone has a tendency to get a bit self-congratulatory. However, it does not detract from the uplifting spirit of the book. I highly recommend it."
5,I Can Relate!,"After having been kidnapped, beaten, tortured and raped by early Al qeada operatives in 1992,I am in awe of anyone on this planet who can survive and overcome the odds and find their way back to life just as Lance Armstrong had done.He writes from the heart with all the strength of conviction of a true survivor!Fantastic!- Yvonne Bornstein, Author, Eleven Days Of Hell"
5,AMAZING BOOK,"IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A BOOK TO READ READ THIS ONE. It is inspiring, motivational, and touching all in one. Definetly a must read for any literate person on this earth, as well as Lance's second book, Every Second Countssupport cancer research, visit [...]"
1,A Criminal...,"His claim is that he has been competing all his life so he deserves to compete once again. What he fails to acknowledge is that he never competed in his life since doping is not a competition, it is a crime. After making his money illegally by doping, he harassed, sued, threaten everyone and anyone who made any statement not to his liking and now he is looking for forgiveness. He should be sent to a prison and allowed to preach his senseless vision behind bars. He should be treated as a criminal and pay for his lies, manipulation and disregard to all rules of a sport and humanity... A white color criminal, the lowest form of human being, a true disgrace. I truly feel sorry for his siblings since they will have to endure difficulties for a sick parent like him when they had nothing to do with his actions. Wish his siblings health and happiness."
4,A frank and open book about overcoming the big 'C''s challenges,"A frank and honest portrait of one mans struggle. This is not a 'wow, aren't I great' book, but one that shows the awful journey people have to take and what gets them to ""over come the odds"".The achievement of the subject of this entertaining read is his amazing recovery from cancer which was followed shortly afterwards by spectacular sporting success. The book is undoubtedly compelling, and was simply, clearly and strikingly written.Even if you're not into cycling you will love this book."
4,Great Read,"As a fellow cancer survivor, I really enjoyed Lance's book. I had wanted to read it for a long time and was not disappointed. For an athelete, he is a very good writer."
5,Inspirational,"This book is an inspiration. It shows the hardships of battling cancer and the effort of recovery. Lance Armstrong is one of the most driven individuals I've ever read about; I could not put it down. Recommended for anyone and everyone, MUST READ!!!"
3,Coleman's Ap bio review,"Its Not About the BikeI thought it was a pretty good book. I thought lance Armstrong's arrogance and egotistic views were a little much at times but it was a very emotional book, all about his hardship fighting cancer and how badly he wanted to survive. I thought the story about him going from a nobody to a legend interesting. The chemotherapy and Lance having to get surgery done had to have been really hard not only on him but also on his mom and all of his friends. All in all it was a good book it really opened my eyes on the hardship of cancer and how scary it would be to have to face it. I thought Lance was very persistent he was always in a good mood and ready for the next trial and tribulation."
4,Well written,The book gave good insight into what Lance had to endure and the success of his efforts dispite the still ongoing doubters that plague many sportsmen and woman.Focus on moving foreward.I have enjoyed reading it and have made a point to bookmark some passages in his book for references that I can use with my children and others I know who are or may face simular challenges Lance wrote about.William
4,Chris loved this book,"This book was a great book. It has a lot of information about what testicular cancer is, and Lance Armstrong's life as a Tour de France racer. The message I got from this book is to never give up if things don't go your way. Lance just kept going and going, even when he had cancer and even when he got hit by a car. He just gets up and keeps riding and never gives up. This book also gives you a lot of information about bike racing and how the races work. I learned a lot about determination and what it takes to be the best. I give this book 4 stars because it is such an awesome book."
4,This book makes you realize how easy some people have it.,"This book was probably the best one that I've read in a while. The reality of what Armstrong went through and how he triumphed over it is an amazing story. The book was hard hitting and made me realize that some people have no idea how hard it is to deal with the idea of having cancer. They take life and all its perks for granted, not thinking about what some people go through on a daily basis."
1,"Fraud of a book, fraud cyclist, fraud co-author, fraud publisher","It is now clear that most everything Armstrong says is a lie. Most of this book is based on lies and readers should consider a class action law suit against Armstrong, Jenkins and the publisher Berkley to get our money back for the book."
3,Disappointed,"As a cancer survivor, I was told this book was inspirational and 'not about the bike'. I was disappointed- because it is about the bike and the huge ego of the rider. Yes, his fight was amazing and his Foundation is a thing of beauty for all survivors - but the book was too much cycle for me. It's also hard to read about his commitment to his family - written before the divorce and multiple girlfriends. Some of his experiences with the medical profession, made it worthwhile for me."
4,"Good story, a bit too hollywood though for my taste",It's a good story but written a bit too much like a movie and also sounds like a 3rd grader wrote it. I liked his struggles and triumphs. Sucks it's somewhat of a lie now...
1,Another disappointed reader.,"I was diagnosed with breast cancer at 33 and read this book in the hospital while recovering from my mastectomy. I found it incredibly inspirational and it encouraged me to take an active participation with my treatments and recovery. I was shocked to learn of his lying and bullying. We don't know what caused his cancer, but doping, could have potentially contributed. Cancer prevention is just as important as cancer cures. What he should have done was confessed when he was diagnosed and used himself as an example of the serious side effects of doping. He could have still started Livestrong. He may not have become as famous, but then he would have been a hero instead of a fraud."
5,LANCE RULES!,"I've been following Lance from his first Tour de France win. Yes, I am one of those people who didn't know who he was until then. This year, while he was after win #5, I thought I would pick up this book and hear his story. And what a magnificent story it is!He doesn't go into detail about his childhood. He tells you about the stepdads that he had, and the father that he didn't. But he doesn't dwell on it. He and his mom are a team working together to support each other. He goes into detail about his cancer diagnosis, and the treatment. He doens't plow you over with big medical terms, he puts it so every one understands. He goes into detail about his recovery, both emoionally and physically, and his comeback to the podium. He tells his story, and doesn't hold anything back. He doesn't want you to feel sorry for him, he just wants you to know what exactly he went through.This is a great story for everyone, not just the cycling enthusiast."
4,uplifting!,"This is a good book to read when you are feeling ""blah""...While I wasn't annoyed when Lance got resentfully back at some people that he feels let him down in life (after all, he is human, just like all of us!), I read with much interest his accounts of his battle with cancer, and of the Tour de France.Whether you like Lance Armstrong or not, whether or not you are into cycling,you have got to admit he's got guts, drive and resiliance. I don't think Lance aimed at being depicted as perfect in this book. Rather, he aims at being the best he can be. And for this alone, the book is worth reading.This is a good reminder of what you can accomplish if you work hard enough for it. Remember the famous quote ""never, never give up...""?"
5,You MUST read this book!,"I am an avid runner and a recreational biker. I understand what it takes to train and to push when you really do not feel like it.After reading this book, I was so inspired. The subject of the book makes you realize how precious every breath you take really is. This is an amazing story about an amazing man. I just kept saying over and over again, ""How did he do this?"" Where did he get the guts to come back from this? It is very hard to understand how the heck this man was able to come back and win the Tour de France after what he went through.After reading the book I vowed never to complain about running in bad weather, or blow off a run when I didn't feel well.It is truly a book you MUST read. It will help you in ways you never thought possible. This is not a story I will forget."
3,Inspirational but the Ego Detracts from the Message,"I went into my read of this book practically worshipping this guy. His accomplishments both on and off the bike are nothing less than extraordinary. The book does have an inspirational message, but I found myself often distracted from it by a constant thread of egomania. Where there is modesty it tends to ring false. If anyone is entitled to feel good about himself it is Lance, but enough already."
5,Inspirational? You bet.,"What a book! I defy anyone with a modicum of sensitivity to put it down willingly before getting to page 275. Lance's wonderful closeness with his mother, his resounding praises of the extensive medical team that oversaw his treatment and recovery, his description of the other riders and promoters of road cycling, his delight at his marriage and birth of his son express the essence of one fascinating young man. It doesn't take a rabid cycling fan to appreciate his recapturing of the '99 Tour de France. Masterful, Ms. Jenkins."
5,You won't want to put it down.,"I am not a cyclist, and I do not follow sports or athletes on television. My fiancee is an avid cyclist with an injury that has prevented him from riding for the past 12 months, so some of the terminology in Lance's books was somewhat familiar. However, I can honestly tell you that this was one of the top books I have ever read. I do not generally read autobiographies, I generally read fiction, brain-candy type books. The only reason I read it is because my fiancee purchased it. He didn't encourage me to read it, he didn't suggest that I read it. I simply picked it up one afternoon and could not put it down. I finished this book in just a few days and I will be recommending it to many people and will be purchasing it for friends. Lance's story is so honest, raw, inspirational and real. It is incredibly well written. Thank you to Lance Armstrong for sharing his deeply personal and inspirational story with us."
5,Great book for anyone needs strong motivation,"No doubt this is one of the best biographies I have ever read. The first half was all about the mother - then VIK, his wife. Looks like Lance mother was the biggest contributor to his success. The book was very nicely written and a real moral booster for anyone. Highly recommended."
4,Regardless of what you think about Lance...,"He might have lied about doping but he didn't lie about surviving cancer or about what he went through. I know because I've been through it. However, if you can't over look the cycling parts in exchange for his will to win at everything including cance, then it might not be for you."
3,A SPORSTMAN,"An interesting book about the simple life of a sportsman fighter.His cancer ,pain ,fight,love and anguish.Easy to read its a good reading for young people who have there projects of life."
4,"""A Miraculous Story""","What an exceptional biography. There is nothing this book witheld. I read it quickly and cherished every moment. I cried, and cheered and laughed, and I was proud to be an American and a Texan. What courage and determination this young man portrays. I feel like I know him; like he's my friend. A remarkable story indeed."
4,"quick and easy read, entertaining at times","Prior to this book, I didn't know much about Lance Armstrong. I admire Lance's will to beat cancer and to live; However, he is a selfish and arrogant man and at times I found his attitude distasteful. Having said that, I did find this book enjoyable and learned a little something about cycling. Worth a read."
3,"Engaging, but the ending will infuriate you.","Floating sometimes inscrutably between the life of a young clothing designer damaged by her turbulent childhood and the life of an old homeless woman clinging to anonymity, this book develops the reader's curiosity but never delivers. Each of the storylines revolves around a romantic love relationship, and the reader finds herself entwined in the parallel plots despite their occasional obtuseness. Though the ride is entertaining, the climax never materializes and the ending leaves the reader disappointed and bitter."
3,Cute shoe,This shoe is really cute on and comfortable. Looks great with slacks. The only disappointment is the leather is not the soft leather that I expected from Vaneli.
3,Not for beginners,This is not for beginners. I have been playing a year and a half now and this is still a bit too much for me.
1,False Advertisement,"The site states that the product is a ""Set of 6 of the most commonly used frequencies contains the following forks: 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, & 4095 cps"" I ordered 3 ""SETS."" When I rec'd my order, there were 3 INDIVIDUAL tuning forks enclosed NOT 3 sets. So, if you're a teacher like I am and are needing a certain number of tuning forks- don't depend on this seller to provide sets!!"
1,misrepresentation of product,This product is mesrepresented. I ordered this thinking I was getting a set of tuning forks to teach my child about sound and sound waves. I only got one fork.
1,Wish I had read the revews,"The product description state that it is a set of tuning forks. I just received one tuning fork. As a teacher, I need a set of tuning forks to teach my 4th graders about sound. This is disappointing and would have though amazon would have taken care of any issue with the seller after so many bad reviews."
1,Product description incorrect!,"The description clearly states that you are purchasing a ""set"". All you get is a single tuning fork. Perhaps the $60 package will include a full set."
1,"Only ONE! Not the perceived (and advertised) ""set.""","I need to pay attention to the fine print and reviews. I, too, am a teacher, and did not realize I was ordering just ONE tuning fork, when the image clearly shows a boxed set. I am not even sure what ""512 cps weighted"" means. I hope I can use this tuning fork for its intendend purpose. I wish the company would have been more clear with its advertising and description."
1,Broken Tuning Fork,"When I received the tuning fork it was broken! If you are looking for a tuning fork and actually need it to work, DO NOT buy it from them. They are super cheap for a reason. Guess I learned my lesson."
3,Like the original guys best.,"Hi, I am using this space to say, ""I would love to see the album 'Gettin Lucky' on CD"" Thank you. That particular album, in my opinion, was the absolute best of Head East."
2,Quite a disappointment!,"I remember the studio versions of ""Since You've Been Gone"" and ""Never Been Any Reason"" from my college years, and the live versions on this album fall way-flop flat by comparison -- tinny, out of harmony and just not there. The band rocked, but the less-than-original membership on this concert really shows. Rats!"
3,Better Than Nothing,"I just got this cd. Granted the recording is not the best but its not the worst i've ever heard. I can only compare it to ""Live At The California Jam"" by Deep Purple or ""Rock Hard Again"" by Kiss. They are not very good recordings but they are all that is avalible for the California Jam and the 1996 reunion tour. Therefore they are better than nothing...just like this CD."
2,Not a very good quality,"Sounds like an old 8 track, but I do love the songs. I wish I had read the reviews before I paid for this to be downloaded. I saw Head East back in '77 and I had the old ""Live"" double LP. So was it worth the 9.99? Yeah I guess so. I think that Amazon. com should give me a credit though."
1,Oh the Horror!,"Please, please do not spend one thin dime on this total piece of drek! I owned a copy of the original ""Head East Live"" back in the day and this my friends is no ""Head East Live""! There should be consumer laws to prevent such as this from being sold. It is a cryin' shame we can't have the real thing and instead are given this abomination. It truly sounds like it was recorded straight to an 8-Track cartridge in someones basement. One can only hope that one day we can enjoy the original live release from this excellent 70's band."
1,Don't even think about it!,"Head East remains one of my favorite rock bands of all time. However, this CD sounds like it was recorded on a $20 box in a concrete room using a deaf man as an engineer. I couldn't have been more disappointed with the quality of this disc. The liner notes were also horrendous! (Choppy, misspellings) It appears that the same care was taken writing these as was in producing this disc. If you want quality live Head East product, beg, then wait for Head East Live on disc. If I were a band member, I'd be furious with this release! Fortunately, I know how good they really are live. Beware the words ""Concert Classics""."
1,CONSUMER RIPOFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I have waited some 20 years for someone to put out the HEAD EAST LIVE LP on cd.I decided to get this as a substitute.WHAT A JOKE!!It sounds like it was recorded in someones bathroom .The worst sounding cd I have ever heard!!Flush it down the toilet if you made the same mistake I did.Save your money and hope someone puts out the live lp release
2,not impressed,"Since I've had no luck finding a copy of Head East Live! I thought this might be comparable. In my opinion, it's a lousy substitute. The live album was awesome! Concert Classics has lousy sound, the vocals are lacking. It sounds 'thrown together' after a long night of partying. Wish I could send it back for the real thing. Sorry guys."
4,Crying out loud,"i've been looking for this at Comic conventions for years. finally purchased it. very good story (at some times confusing), but it all comes together beautifully at the end"
5,Whewwwwww!!!,"I simply don't trust people who don't like this cd. Also, get a copy of their live cd ""Guest List."" I had to get it from their website cigarstoreindians.com.Last time we went to see them we had so much fun I forgot that I don't really drink that often anymore. The 16oz. PBR in the can was the ""best deal,"" but the $20 cab ride, lost cell phone, mysterious scrape on my leg, my new Nikes covered in mud and me sleeping on a sofa when I have a new Sealy Posturpedic matressled me to believe that they must have put on a hellava show."
4,Who woulda known?,"I was first introduced to these guys back in 1995 while I was a student at the University of Georgia. I was immidiately impressed. So as I was browsing through the section here at amazon.com, boy, was I pleasantly suprised to see their discs on sale. If you like rockabilly or alternative country, this is a must from a great Georgia band."
5,Nothing but fun,"This is driving music. No, this is dancing music. No, this is house cleaning music. No, this is sing-along music. No, this is party music. Heck, this fits the bill no matter the mood or situation. Catch these guys live if you can."
1,A little disappointing,"I just couldn't get into this music. I love rockabilly style music, but it just didn't do it for me. I wanted to like the band, I tried to like the band, but I just don't like the band. Every song sounds the same to me."
3,Good CD but some tracks are slim,The sound quality of the CD is good. I was looking for a recording of a large battery and some of these are smaller ensembles with only one person per part. It does groove and is a solid listen so I do recommend it.
2,From a reader in Indiana-,"Many pictures, but some projects and info somewhat outdated. Didn't dicuss new container blend waxes or specific sizes of wicks needed for various candles. It does give specific instructions for whipped and inclusion candles,which I found interesting. Gives detailed lists of items needed for each project."
4,Excellent Book For Anyone With Basic Candle Knowledge,"The Encyclopedia Of Candle Making by Sandie Lea is an excellent book for anyone with the least be of knowledge in candle making. However, with that said you really need to know the basics to get this book because a few things are not explained in detail in the beginning."
5,Perfect Book,This book has so many creative and wonderful ideas for making candles. I would recommend it to anyone!
4,Good low impact video,"I like this video, it's a good low impact workout. I like the fact that it's 45 minutes which helped me get to the next level in my workout from 30 minutes a day. Even though the video is easy/low impact, it's still a great workout because of the 30 second interval burst of high/intense impact exercise. I'm sweating by the end of the video. It's also a little funny."
3,Good DVD,I like the workout but the sound quality is lacking. Music is too low so it's hard to get into a good workout mode. Seems the sound comes and goes.
3,ok,"it gets boring.....seems very disorganized....it doesn't seem to have a good flow. I did not enjoy it.I loved the bursts where you jump or whatever. But overall, there are better dvds out there. Even his circuit walk is better than this one"
5,George Foreman is THE MAN!!!,"I absolutely love this walk and box video. I just had surgery last week, and I'm starting over in my workout routines now, so this is my beginner video to help me get stronger and back into the swing of things. It's simple, yet very effective. You can feel that nice familiar tingle in your muscles when you're done :) I've also just ordered a copy for my mom, who's in her 60's and very out of shape, to start doing this workout as well! Anyone can walk and box with George!!!"
3,WALKING WITH GEORGE IS FUN.,"If you are starting a workout program (or getting back into working out -- like I am), this DVD is a great one to usse. There is walking and a tiny bit of punching. You will not know your distance, but if you decide how much time you want to start with and set your own timer, and increase it each day, you will not be sore. I recommend this for the beginner -- or someone who needs to walk inside 'with a group' on their days off of a reguar routine."
4,George will help get you back in shape,"This tape is mainly for people trying to get back in shape. You can also kick it up a few notches with George's professional exercise partner or pace-it-yourself with the other group of exercisers. I first rented this DVD from the library and found myself re-ordering it about 3 times. I decided to go ahead a finally purchase it. Luckily, I found it at an unbeatible price on Amazon.($2.95) Unopened, and new from a Amazon seller. I would never pay 19.99 for this video when others are offering it cheaper. Might as well go to Walmart if that is the case. I thought the point here was buying it cheaper! Anyway, look for a deal on this DVD because exercise tapes are a dime-a-dozen. And 19.99 is just too much to pay for this DVD."
5,jolie <3,"Smart doll, very educational and fun. I bought this a few years ago and she is still speaking the sayings are easy to remember."
1,French kissing in the USA,"This doll has a limited vocabulary and as such would not be a great purchase for someone wishing to grasp the basic fundamentals of the French language. It only has six stock phrases - and in all honesty these are a little patronising. ""I like to shop"" and ""When I grow up I want to be a fashion designer"". At no point does this doll grunt ""25 Euros"" to you whilst proffering half a pint of warm, flat generic Belgian lager in a lipstick smeared, chipped glass."
3,Heavy-handed morality tale about a lost doll,"A little girl named Dulcy finds that a doll named Angela she received as a gift and immediately lost takes on better and better attributes the longer she is missing. Over the winter, Dulcy becomes insufferable with family and friends about how much better Angela was than any other doll, either gifts she receives or other girls' toys, and Angela's abilities and outfits continually one-up the other children's dolls. When Angela is finally found, Dulcy is chagrined to realize that the doll she imagined and the doll she lost are quite different. For such a self-aggrandizing person, Dulcy realized the moral of her experience awfully fast. Also, the repitition of Angela's qualities and outfits, with a new one added each time Dulcy imagines it, would be more suitable for a picture book for much younger readers."
5,Sparkling!!,"This set is very elegant, and the way the crystal is cut adds extra brilliance to the glasses. Just what I wanted!!"
4,Great piece,I'm giving this a four star only for the reason that the decanter top i received was not the one pictured. It was a square piece. Still looks great and is nice and heavy looks more expensive then it was. Great piece
5,Great Whiskey Set,"This decanter set does exactly what it's supposed to. Hold whiskey, look classy. Very nice."
5,Lots of Bling for the Buck,"All of these Godinger decanters are good quality and attractive. This is an especially good buy because of the glasses, which are nice, heavy-weight, double old-fashioneds. The round, all glass, well-fitted stopper gives some oomph to the design. Very nice and worth the money. This even came with a silver tray. I'm about to buy a second set so that I'll have 12 glasses and four (all Godinger from Amazon) decanters."
4,Good Quality,"This arrived relatively quickly, with absolutely no pieces marred in any way. These glasses and decanter are of a heavy weight and have a nice design on them. My husband was thrilled to get them for Christmas '09. The tray is not horrible, but it doesnt fit in with the finer look of the set. It looks too 'fake' I guess I would say. We just dont use it. It is a good price for a set of Godinger. I would definitely recommend this to someone looking for a set that is not too cheap, but that cannot afford one for a couple hundred dollars. Great quality for the price."
1,This DVD was Poor in Quality,"I was very disappointed in this DVD, the special features promised on this DVD, did not work, the viewing quality was poor, the DVD paused in several places, and froze up, so i could not enjoy the movie at all , it was not what i expected from a disney movie!!! would not buy this DVD if i were you, its a waste of money!!!"
5,Several Language Littles,"I purchased the German, French and Spanish ""Language Littles"" for my daughter and son 4 years ago and all of them continue to work on the original batteries! My children love these dolls and love to mimac the commands that they give. If I had known how much they would increase in value, I would have kept them in better condition but my children have enjoyed dressing them, taking them on trips and playing with them so they are now well loved dolls!"
4,Your kid will learn from this toy,"I'm Italian, and I bought this toy for my 2 years old daughter and she likes it! I certainly do too. The Italian accent is accurate and the micro switches are discoverable for her (hands and leg). She picked up some new words for her. And she knows what they mean, now. Sometimes she waits the question and then answer at herself. I would recommend this doll. We live in the USA and I want her to learn my native language.There's only one thing that the company should do in order to improve this toy. Allow customers to update the words/sentences spoken by the doll - because the educational value can be consumed in less than 2 week of constant use. Kids are like sponges when it comes to learning."
2,design,Overall construction is good however the side top edge does not have a cushion for the ankle bone . This caused an abrasion under the ankle. Product was returned and credit was issue in a satisfactory manner.
5,Song of Lawino,"I first read this book as a twelve year old being introduced into poetry by my Australian English teacher. Needless to say, I found most of the poetry books prior to this one, to be a torturous exercise for a twelve year old. Okot p'Bitek spoke to the reality that was so real and I could identify some of the characters in my personal life. The choice of words and how they are put together is what I took away from the book. I found the main character, Lawino, to be very funny. I am a Kenyan and on any market day I would go to the market and be surrounded by a lot of Lawinos who are very open and unique in the way they interact within their environment. Very self assured and full of confidence. And self confidence with the written word is the best gift I ever received from this book."
4,ABCs of Angelfishes,The book is very easy to read. It's written as Dr. Axelrod's own experience in keeping Angelfishes. You'll learn more about Angelfishes while you read the book. The book provides generous pictures of Angelfishes' strains. Quite a complete brief on Angelfishes. Covers diseases and breeding too.
1,BEWARE ordering this if you want TWO DISCS!,"I too ordered this thinking it was two discs. I even wrote AMAZON customer service asking them to confirm it was TWO CDs! They told me it was TWO CDs. I bought it and only ONE arrived. I'm returning this and I have already ordered a different version that has a sticker saying ""BONUS CD INCLUDED!""Put this Item # B00016B9F8 into your Amazon.com search to find it. It cost less too! It just better be the right one or I will rip Amazon sellers on that one too. If I post a positive review there, you'll KNOW it has TWO DISCS!So, just to be clear: this review is 1 star because someone cannot get their facts straight. It is NOT AT ALL reflective of the songs or material included!The songs are a ""best of"" and the songs that I'd heard before buying this are indeed great songs. I have heard all of the other songs and they're great too (Especially ""Superloud""!)PG is simply amazing. Just be sure what you're ordering and that you're getting what you wanted."
1,Don't make the same mistake that I did!,"Don't make the same mistake that I did! I thought these were new walking tapes from this company. They turned out to be the same two Pilates walking tapes that I bought separately a few years ago. They were put together in a new package with a new name and distribution date. I like the tapes very much but I gave this product one star because of the poor customer service I received from them (not Amazon). They said it was too bad that I made the mistake of not reading the product descriptions closely. ""Walk On to Total Fitness"" (2005) and ""Walk On to Weight Loss"" (2005) became ""Walking For Your Heart"" (2009) by putting them together in one box."
3,Really 'mini',"The ducks super small, my 7 month old could have easily taken the whole bird in this mouth!! So now instead of a shower toy it makes a really cute window sill decoration....but definately NOT for smaller children."
3,GOOD,"I have learned most of the 1,00 words in this book over a short period of time. It is very helpful if you want to learn Japanese."
5,The Sad Truth About Saudi Arabia!,"Hatred's Kingdom, proves beyond a shadow of a doubt, that the Saudi government is both the financial and ideolgical engine of radical Islam. I learned a great deal from this book -- especially from the primary source documents in the back of the book. Saudi Arabia is no ally of the United States - it is part of the problem not the solution to the evils of terrorism that destroyed the innocents in the World Trade Center.Another, more fun view of the Kingdom, is Keshner's COCKPIT CONFESSIONS OF AN AIRLINE PILOT... What a great and informative read."
3,"Good start, weak finish","I found the historical chapters of the book (up until about 1960) to be most useful section. As we pass into King Fahd's reign, the reasoning becomes much more speculative. Nonetheless, the author presents a plausible scenario. Careful documentation of the links between the major players is useful, and however you slice it, the latter chapters show the razors' edge the political leaders of Saudi Arabia must walk."
5,Blessed murder,"Gold delivers a meticulous chronical of the birth and repugnant growth of Saudi Wahabism. The fact that this brutal, inflexible sect consisting essentially of murdering all those who do not adhere completely to its monstrous doctrine can be the state religeon of Saudi Arabia is terrifying.Buy this book. Read it. Then send it to George W. Bush."
5,a must read expose,Amazing truth about petrodollars funding Saudi Wahhabist export. And how Wahhabism has led Muslims to kill other Muslims. A must read to understand modern day terrorism.
5,"hating the hate, not the hater","Obviously this book doesn't say that the people of Saudi Arabia are ""bad"" people. It is just saying that certain ideologies such as ""Wahhabism"" that construct the national identity of Saudi Arabia are ""bad"" just as ""Nazism"" or any other docrine that claims one race superior and another inferior. This is a great book as a companion to other books on the subject (such as the bible). While it isn't the final authority on the subject, it certainly is valuable to anyone that wants to understand how people are taught to hate. This doesn't mean that Saudi Arabians are the only ones taught to hate. Every country has cultural forms of teaching racism. This book is about the hate taught in Saudi Arabia and does a great job. Truth is humility."
5,Wake up Call for the West!!,"While the current east/west conflict is reportedly NOT about religion, it does need to be about fanaticism and hatered and how it is instilled in the youth through religious training in the Saudi Schools (warning to the west here, don't let religion in the public schools!) and how the United States in it's ""politically correct bias"" glosses over the real problem of hate, financial support of hate, and the relationship between oil and blackmail and terrorism. We are fighting the wrong enemy when we go after Iraq. Gold's book is a wake-up call for all countries that want civilization to continue and improve. Read it. Act on it."
1,Spin and nothing but Spin,"Much of the exhaustive research in this book is outdated, well-known by world governments, involved many of the world governments when the events/transactions were taking place. Reading this books you would think that is some new discovery dug out from the dark pits it was banished to because no one wanted anyone to know about it.... actually no... I have seen, read, and heard countless debates and lectures on this information from world government officials and the like. This is OLD NEWS and very WELL - KNOWN STUFF."
1,Written by a hypocrit with a major agenda,"I read this book and felt overwhelmed with resentment at thewriter and people who share his views.The book was written toinsight hatred and distrust between America and Saudi Arabia,maybe to keep the evangelicals on the march to Israelipromotional conventions.What better way to get the money flowingthen to write a book to engage American emotions and fears.And how interesting it is that Gold's home country never takesresponsibilty for anything it does,and mistakes made.Yeh,aim the blame at someone else while you take more Palestinianland and make their lives a living hell.Then take more from usAmericans while you spread discord between two countries whoneed more understanding rather than your hate driven lies.Also this book does not represent the many conflicting opinionsof his people,the Israelis,not all of them think as he does."
1,AtheistWorld.Com Book Review,"This book leaves out much to be desired.You are better off reading ""Islam Exposed"" by Solomon Tulbure ISBN: 1932303456"
1,"Interesting, but with a heavy bias.","Though this book has many interesting things to say, it greatly worries me how many people are accepting it at face value. Remember who is writing this text, an adivsor, ambassador to the UN and foreign policy advisor for Israel. I'm sure that had someone less biased written an account of Saudi Arabia it would sound very different. Not to mention that many people have quite a few choice things to say about the actions of Israel itself. It is always a good idea to get many points of view, but we must remember that they are only points of view and are colored by circumstances."
1,Zip 750 Unreliable,"I've been a Zip disk fan for many years. However, this 750 drive (firewire) and accompanying disks has been terrible. I just had my third disk go currupt in as many months. All data lost. I'm finding another media for daily backups..."
4,Abstracted Bliss,"...Perhaps, one of the best uses of Mastroianni in a supporting role that supports more roles than a circus. This is a classic, which deserves DVD distribution and should be in every Polanski fan library. Give, Take!"
3,Rather Limited Content,The book is pretty but the content is far from complete. Photo content seems rather amateurish and site visitations are very limited. A good starting point for addtional research.
4,Great duck book,"This is a very good one-ingredient book. It contains a number of very varied duck recipes. It doesn't go all the way to include duck blood, but it does cover most of the meat. Naturally from a western tradition, but also with some nice Asian recipes included.The weakness of the book is the short section about ducks. Many people outside the US buy American books and it would have been nice with a section on French ducks and Chinese ducks as well. And more about American ducks too. Basically more information about the ingredients.The binding of the book is so sturdy so I don't think it can ever break!I can recommend this book for all duck lovers and for the rest of you I can really recommend the author of this book."
4,"They are great but, too large for my ears",They are comfy and I am able to wear them for long periods of time where with some other metals I can not. The thing is I have smaller ears than some people so the stones are a little big for my ears I think but other than that they are just fine.
3,"Considerin the price, these are decent enough",The actual ear-ring that comes are much different than the one shown here in the picture. So hold ur expectations!!!The real color is much much lighter than the color that seems to be pink here. So dont expect much in this price.But still i will say that you wont regeret owing them after your purchase. These are decent enough for normal wear.
5,"Sterling Silver, stud, pink, earrings","Not pink as the picture is, only pink cast. They are large enough that my old hands can handle. Some of the tiny earrings are difficult. I have worn several times and like them very much."
5,My boys loooooove little Einsteins!,I only wish it was still on tv and that all their toys are not ridiculously expensive because they're no longer in production. All 3 of my boys have been completely obsessed with the show and have learned a great deal from it... Surprisingly so actually.
2,Insufficient vacabulary,"Not a good source for anyone starting to learn arabic. The arabic exglish translation is insufficient. Also words that are in Quran are not easy to find in this dictonary.however, it might be sufficient for anyone who wants to carry it for quick reference."
5,Best small dictionary I've tried out of at least 10,"I was enrolled in an intensive, 20-hour/week Arabic class, and I was in serious need of a good dictionary that I could carry around in my backpack. I probably went through at least 10 dictionaries from other well known publisher and some travel guides, but most turned out to be terrible (mixing different local dialects, mispelling or not adhering to romanization, etc).This dictionary has a very large selection of useful words, and I found it to be the easiest and most convenient dictionary to carry around for the serious Arabic learner.I would also recommenend this dictionary in conjunction with a small phrase book for tourists as well."
2,not very useful,"i tossed this thing after a year. might be good for people studying arabic just for university. a tiny little dictionary like this could never cover E-A and A-E both very well, so whats the use? a bigger dictionary, like the mawrid, is necessary to make real progress."
4,Good general purpose aid to pronunciation and meaning,I found this book to be very useful in the college level class that I am taking from Kansas State. The text allows easy reference to many words that commonly occur in class at a beginner level.
2,Save your money and buy a better dictionary,"Because eventually you will have to. This dictionary is very basic and contains a very limited vocabulary. It is done so thoughtlessly that you have to flip through the Arabic pages in reverse since they are printed as if Arabic was written from left to right. Small oversight, but still annoying."
2,Just Okay,This book has the information one needs to learn the words but is difficult due to having to flip back and forth to form a sentence. Unlike many of the newer methods of learning a new language. This does make a good reference guide.
2,Arabic Translation,"I bought this book because I needed a reference for picking names for my Arabian horses. Parts of the book are okay, but most of it is a bit cumbersome to use. Unless you speak pretty fluent Arabic, don't bother."
2,Not as great as it appears.,"In comparison to other compact Arabic-English dictionaries that I have bought, I, at first, found this book heaven-sent. As a second-year Arabic student, I found the large amounts of vocabulary extremely helpful... that is until I began to check my work with native Arab speakers. A number of words listed in this book are incorrect, and do not match up with their translated meanings. Sometimes the translations are extremely off base, and now that I've become aware of this fact, I use it less and less. It can be very helpful for basic words and for the beginner, but it's important to know that it contains a number of errors."
3,Okay but not great.,"I bought this dictionary when I was doing an Arabic immersion Program through the University of Wisconsin. I was looking for a concise pocket dictionary to carry with me to class to suppliment the Hans Wehr Dictionary. I found this dictionary acceptable as a reference but not super helpful. It contains pretty basic vocabulary. If you are loking for anything more complicated, such as 'exile', it is pretty worthless. Although it does contain tranliterations of words, there is hardly any vowling. I found the the Oxford better as E-A since it includes voweling, multiple meanings and and also prepositions. However, the Oxford dictionary also has problems with accuraccy. The fact that the A-E section is aphebetical also makes looking up Arabic words combersium. If you are a first year student, this will probably be sufficient but beyond that you will quickly run into its limitations."
4,useful to have and very portable,"This dictionary has some things going for it that make it worth having. The vocabulary it offers is very contemporary, the Arabic is printed in a nice-looking font, and quality English-Arabic dictionaries of any size are hard to find. So I made a lot of use it for classes where written compositions were assigned. And it isn't too heavy to carry around and won't take up a lot of room in a briefcase or book bag. My one criticism would be that the Arabic-English half is organized by alphabetical order, not by roots as most Arabic dictionaries are. Best suggestion: get this along with Hans Wehr (Arabic-English only) and get going right away learning to look up words by roots. It's a slow and painstaking learning process, but it's a very necessary skill in learning Arabic, so it's really better not to put it off. Use the Arabic-English half of Awde only if you're in a hurry to finish an assignment."
5,ruskin rocks,"A great book, full of Ruskin's own special insights on art. Esp art in relation to the world, how it impacts our lives, re life, religion, morals, functionality, even. There are sections on aspects of rendering too... line, color, light. All in all, useful to artists and artwriters alike. It is no less applicable now than when these lectures were delivered, I think, only the phrasing, not the content, is nineteenth century. These were very important thoughts, that set the tenor of art criticism for the entire 20th century. A few really clear b/w illustrations attend the text beautifully."
5,One of the best...,"Disregard the brain-dead, jealous comments of als 932; this is one of the best books of its kind on the Vietnam war. Period. Thank you Mr. Kelly."
2,"Ok, but.....","More Navy propoganda! While everyone who saw them will agree that the seawolves were good, they were only playing Cavalry. Just as we always considered the SEALs to be tall ARVNs, we in the AIR Cavalry always considered the Seawolves part of the ARVN air force. They were a defensive/reative force, we in the Army air cavaly were the offensive force. Book doesn't mention that because the seawolves had to operate off of boats, they couldn't carry our ammo load and therefore couldn't stay in the fighting as long as army gunships. If you didn't have to trot along side your gunship on takeoff because it was overweight with ammo, you couldn't expect to stay in the fighting very long. OK, book for those who know nothing about gunships but not so great for those of us who were on them."
1,Major Disappointment,This book isn't very good. The author tends to exaggerate the situations he encounters. His emphasis that he is there because of his choice gets tiresome really quick. His believe that God was helping him kill the enemy is the same type of thinking terrorists use to justify their murders. There are many other better books on helicopter combat in Vietnam such as Dustoff or Low Level Hell. Stay away from this one it is only good as kindling.
4,Redness gone,The cream is working and my redness is slowly going away. Will continue touse it as I am tired of looking red all the time. Would recommend to anyone whosuffers with red skin.
2,dissapointed,"I was surprised at the little jar! I guess I didn't read the size when I ordered...anyway- it didnt help at all. I went back to another product that I use that keeps it (rosacea) under control. I had high hopes , but this product couldn't meet them:("
5,This stuff feels terrific -- very soothing!,"I just received this yesterday and already my skin is calmed down. And it feels really nice going on. Very soothing and cooling actually. I also like how it's slightly tinted which helps decrease the redness. As an added bonus, it didn't make me break out. I recommond this product very highly."
1,Ineffective at best,Ordered the cream and it does nothing to control rosacea. It is ineffective at best or sometimes it seemed it made the condition worse. Disappointed :(
1,Make my skin flaky and dry,i wouldn't be surprised to find out most of the positive reviews are fake. Used it overnight and when i woke up my skin was dry and flaky where i had put it on. Put it on in the morning and by lunch time i need to use something else as it causes my skin to flake. Won't buy it again and would not recommend it.
4,The Lost Continentals will put you in a good mood...,"If you're a hepcat looking for some sweet sounds, check out this CD. It's got some catchy tunes that'll have you singin' in the shower. The female vocals are soft and sultry, and the rhythms are swingin'. I usually prefer bigger bands, but this sound really got to me. They're a great little group."
2,probably for completists only,"This set captures some of the band's Reading festival performances of 1980/1982. It focuses mainly on thier current material, of the time; so, you won't find a lot of variety or ""classic"" Budgie tracks. The band's performance is just fine, spirited and reasonably tight, but, they suffer from lack of a second guitarist (unlike much of the ""Heavier than Air"" collection), sounding thin much of the time. This problem is worsened by the major lack of low end; Burke's bass is pretty much inaudible without major eqing. All in all, not very satisfying, even for Budgie fans. Try ""Heavier than Air"" for a better retrospective of live Budgie."
1,Ten Minutes Tops,"After spinal surgery I started wearing sturdy shoes. Since I have wide toes and a narrow arch and heel, I thought these gel mats might help with heel comfort. However, after just a few minutes one of the heel mats slid sideways and was very uncomfortable. This ""one-size-fits-all"" did not fit in my shoes."
3,Basically common sense approaches,"This book was exactly as described by the author, a common sense approach for finding fish in a lake. The methods that are described are good for newcomer to the sport, but are otherwise ""common sense"" for anglers with some experience. The same information could easily be gleaned from a couple of articles on fishing in Outdoor Life, etc. Overall, this was not helpful for me, but could be for a novice."
2,Please remix this CD and REMOVE THE BIRD SOUNDS,"I grew up in the deep South where thunder storms are common. They are soothing and meditative. ""Distant Thunder"" has all the potential of being that way, except for those darn bird sounds. There are no birds in thunderstorms. They are hiding from the rain and are not out chirping their heads off. The rolling thunder in ""Distant Thunder"" is wonderful and transcending, but the bird chirping jolts one out of a blissful state and wreaks havoc upon the expanded Alpha state of the brain. Additionally, when the volume of the thunder is building, the bird chirping gets louder. It is difficult to focus on the calming sounds of thunder when the shrill bird noises over ride the thunder. ""Distant Thunder"" needs to be remixed and have the birds removed totally. Otherwise, it needs to be renamed ""Cacophony of Birds""."
4,I was Mislead. *** only 3 stars ***,I thought it would be more instrumental... with solo's and descargas. It's more vocal and all around not the type of jams you'd hear on the dancefloor. I still like it to listen to.
4,Great for introducing a foreign language,"I bought this for my 4 yr. old daughter the year we moved to Japan. My thought was to just peak her interest in learning a few words. She loved the doll. Yes, a couple words are a little unclear, but overall just fine. We looked in the book anyways to make sure. Aside from that, she really liked the little book that came with it. She picked up a couple words and phrases in just a few days. Not much for teaching, but great for enthusiasm."
4,Warm & Dry!,"These boots kept my feet not only warm, but totally dry! Not particularly stylish, but in the middle of a snowstorm who cares!!!"
1,"loud, high-pitched and annoying","I'm a Bernie Krause fan, and was excited for the latest addition to my collection. What a disappointment! Although this has all the environmental realism you expect from a Krause CD, normally they're beautiful and soothing, and this one had roughly the pitch and frequency of a morning alarm clock... well, a bit faster and not as loud unless you crank the volume, but you get the idea--not soothing! More like crickets on crack. After the first painful 30 seconds, I skipped through the rest of the ""East"" sound track at 5-second intervals, but it never let up. The ""West"" soundtrack was a bit better, but still unpleasant. Perhaps if you grew up around these sounds you'll like it (I did, after all, learn to sleep to a chorus of high-pitched, loud frogs croaking in Venezuela, although it took 2 years), but if you're not already in that zone, I'd recommend one of Krause's many other wonderful CDs. Dawn at Trout Lake is good, as are Green Meadow Stream and Sounds of Nature."
1,"Iomega! failed product, terrible support, not willing to help!","Have you ever wonder why they sell all those factory reconditioned stuff?Well, I contacted web support to replace disks, they told me the drive was out of warranty, I explained the drive was perfect, I have unusable media, and that I could send the damaged disks back to them so they could check them, also offered all the serial numbers for all disks.They refused to do anything without a Proof of purchase, and hung me up.Great Support (?), I swear I won't buy anything again from this company.As advise, do the same."
4,"Short, Sweet and Mostly Complete History","The Lands have an easy, breezy writing style. In particular they bring the last 100 years of Las Vegas history alive with many photos of the times and observations of citizens and visitors alike who were there. Although they do not discuss the role the divorce business or the wedding industry played in the city's development (and weddings are associated with Vegas almost as much as gaming), the picture of the city presented here is fun and informative. To quote the authors quoting Steve Wynn, ""Las Vegas is a party that never stops. God bless this daffy place."""
4,A great short history for someone who just wants a peek!,"This history of Las Vegas is indeed short but more important than that, nearly every page is interesting and entertaining. I was not all that impressed with the final chapter about what there is to do and see outside the city which is why this book only gets 4 stars instead of 5. That last chapter seemed misplaced in this book. But the entire rest of the book which tells the history of the city is wonderful. It gives you all the most interesting stories and information without overdoing it. It is just enough for someone who wants an overview of the city but isn't all that interested in becoming an expert."
1,wow pad,"Don't care for this type of mouse pad, I thought it would be the padded kind that stay in place. Disapointed and think price is way too high for product."
3,Walden not for me,"I read this book in High School and didn't really understand it then and when I just completed it for the second time, I felt the same way. Understanding the Transcendentalism and Brahamn just isn't for Me. It was tough at times to read and sometimes it was easy. It is just not for me, however other people like it and that is fine with me."
4,Smoke Screen,"Mitzi's mother is trying desperately quit smoking, and her withdrawal symptons is driving the whole family crazy. But Mitzi has more to worry about than her Mom's mood swings. She's got to find a way to get Mike Humphrey, her mad crush, to beam his ultra-smile in her direction. And her best friend, Birdy, is too busy getting chummy with a popular girl named Roxy to help. So when Mitzi tells miake a huge lie about her mother's condtition just to get his attention, she has no one to blame but herself for the trouble that follows.I really enjoyed this story, even though I have never had any similar problems. I can still relate to Mitzi though, by the way she tries to get boy's attention, yet I have never gotten in as much trouble as she does in this story !"
4,pleease read this book!!,"I liked this book because it talkes about the importance of not smoking, especially when you have children. This book talks about this girl and her mom, who's smoking, and how the girl struggles to get her mom to stop smoking. A very good lesson for children of almost all ages."
3,Mediocre film,I thought the film could have been better done. It was depressing subject matter as well. It was a sad commentary.
3,Expensive for what you get,"A bit pricey for what you get, which isn't much. The play set opens up, but has almost nothing inside, compared to the Mac playset, which costs slightly less. Comes with a car lift, and stickers to ""detail"" other cars. Best feature is a light-up sign, which isn't very interesting. I think it should have come with a vehicle for better value."
3,Ramones House of Body review,"I thought this was coming ""New""..but it was ""Used""..I didn't receive any stickers to decorate any other cars like some others did. The box and toy was scratched and smelled very musty...Not very happy"
4,Radiator Springs - The Town,"My twin four year old nephews are absolutely crazy about ""Cars"". Their grandfather has built the town of Radiator Springs for them using Ramone's House of Body Art, Flo's Cafe, and Luigi's garage. It's great."
5,Definitive!!!,"Forrest McDonald is the only biographer of Hamilton who has what it takes to discuss his subject. As a Professor of Economics and Law, he understands not only the fields in which Hamilton worked, but the historical importance of this brilliant Founding Father.Hamilton has been subjected to a massive deconstruction by the Jeffersonian Party--and it still goes on. Perhaps TJ made the grand speeches and declarations which define our Republic--but Alexander Hamilton lived the life and took the political risks which have made America the greatest nation on earth. This Founder was no mere politician, no businessman with his eye on the main chance, but a profound economic philosopher.If you want to read a book which will tell you the truth about Alexander Hamilton, make this the one!"
2,Disappointing and misleading,"Be careful of this book. Hamilton was a great man -- and one much misunderstood in his own time ... and today.McDonald, unfortunately, goes too far in Hamilton's defense. He attempts to paint a picture where Hamilton was responsible for virtually everything that was done right -- and who cautioned against most of the missteps. Everyone else (not just Jefferson!) is painted as incompetent, stupid, conspiring, and selfish.Nor does McDonald at least acknowledge (except in some endnotes) where he departs from the ""conventional"" view point. And, as other reviewers note, there is little discussion of Hamiltons personal life and habits, his family, etc.If you are very familair with the personalities and issues of the time, this book provides an interesting viewpoint and a very good discussion of the banking issues involved.But don't start here."
5,Hamilton's Rightful Place In History and This Book Belong Together!!!!!!,"Hamilton is often cast as a villain in most treatments of America's founding. Why? Well, because the authors are often so in love with Jefferson that they cannot be fair and objective. Jefferson is always painted as the savior of the nation, but that is not entirely accurate. Hamilton contributed to the nation's structure and policy debates. He helped work to ensure the national debt was paid, in addition to creating a climate favorable for business. All these worked to place the new country on the path that would lead to greatness. Only misguided policies in the modern era would derail what Hamilton has given us. Mcdonald gets it right, and is fair, but just not fair enough for the Jefferson fanatics. Get it and enjoy!!!!"
4,Worth the price for health reasons,"These are definitely not as spicy as most hot dogs and smaller than the average, but with buns and condiments quite a good alternative to the meat-based products. A lot of people couldn't tell the difference I am sure."
4,Favorite classic,Some typos. No graphics which were an integral part of some stories; make story a little hard to follow. Read this as a child 60 some years ago. Glad to be back. Can't beat the price (free).
5,The Ox,"Set in rural Sweden in the late 1800's, ""The Ox"" (original Swedish title ""Oxen"") is an insightful period film starring Stellan Skärsgard, Liv Ullman, and Max Von Sydow, and is directed by Sven Nykvist.The main character (Skärsgard) is driven by hunger to kill and butcher the land-owner's ox for his family, and must then deal with the consequences of his wrong-doing. For insight into the Swedish immigration into the U.S., this movie makes a wonderful chronological predecessor to the film ""The Emmigrants"", starring Max von Sydow, which became the basis for the story ""Unto a New Land"", which was adapted to the U.S. TV series ""Little House on the Prairie"". In Swedish with English subtitles."
4,A boy and his hero,"This movie is a light hearted version of the Karate Kid. Sidekicks was a pleasure to watch. It was fun and did not take itself to seriously. Even the fight sceens were amuzing and during the shoot outs no one got hurt. Its about a boy and his tv hero and the boy becoming the hero. Jonathan Brandis was very good and believeable in the part. Chuck Noris and Joe Piscapoe were at their best.The movie did not feel the need to have a fight to the death for a finally instead there was a wholesome message and a moral.The movie had a lot of laughs and some mild drama nothing intense.even Chuck,s big fightsceene with Joe Piscapo is funny The cast was excelent so was the soundtrac. This movie is suitable for all age groupes. If you are like me and like light entertainment a happy ending and a wholesome message than this movie is for you."
3,"back when Chuck Norris was famous, now he's a wash up JOKE who's forgotten about",Some little boy is a Chuck Norris want to be every day he day dreams about him. He takes ninja classes and competes in a tournment. He breaks 9 bricks which he was scared to do at first what help him contrate was his master giving him advice and setting the bricks on fire.
4,Ululación!!!,"Up, Down, Sideways... If you can't find a tune you like on this CD stick a pencil in your head. From Disco to Chill - all with enough latin flavour to clear your sinuses. Sweaty, Sizzling & Sticky... screw the pacemaker, JUST TURN IT UP!"
5,What more can I say?,These guys ROCK!!!!! Got turned on to the band pretty recently and I have been impressed with every thing about these guys! They are unbelievable! I have been listening to them at work and now all my co-workers are huge fans! The only thing better than their latest CD is seeing them live! Check out their site www.thirtysecondstomars.com for tour info...you won't regret it!
5,Totally blown away.,"This is my first exposure to this group. A friend recommended I check out the song ""A Beautiful Lie"". I did and loved it. It's an amazing song. He suggested ""From Yesterday"". Also a great song. I then went ahead and purchased the whole album. There isn't a single song I don't like. I don't know why these guys aren't huger in the industry. It's great music, great lyrics, and really powerful vocals."
2,Just an okay album,"""Attack"", ""The Kill"", ""Was It A Dream?"" ""The Fantasy and even the over played ""From Yesterday"" are the tracks that stick with you. The rest of the album isn't that good. The others are kind of slow and blend in together. I fell asleep while listening to this album."
4,great album,"Well first of all try to understand my bad english (I'm italian). This album is a better project that the first 30 seconds to mars ones, lyrics and music are very well connected and structured, every song is really enjoyable. Over all the voice of jared leto is better than in the other album, less experimental and more warm and rich, with various emotional blending. The kill is one the best songs of the album with really intense concept. Listen all the album, it's a really good job."
2,Boring....,"This album was very boring, I don't know how this band got famous, it's so boring. Song ""Modern Myth"" was soft and so boring, it songs ""Attack"" and ""From Yesterday"" that I like. Don't get this album! I'll advice you not to get it!"
1,BORING EMO,"The first album was great space prog rock. With 'A Beautiful Lie' it's all woshy sloshy emo and Jared whining. So far the biggest disappointment for me this year. Save your money, or better still download it if you're really desperate."
4,30sm pumps in the emotion,"I think we have some strange critics here. Jared Leto has definately matured in this second time around, and i think the machine is definately tighter and more open. Their debut was definately amazing, don't get me wrong. But there is always a need for change (can't have the same album twice, sorry guys). The 'space rock' sounds are still there, and Leto's vocals have reached purity. What a great song to start of this album too. Attack is pulsating, and we get a hit of Leto that we've never seen before. Right when i bought this cd, i had listened to it 4 times nonstop. Even the hidden track on 10. This is definately my favorite cd of the year, and i'm am definately impressed."
1,Copy protection = no purchase.,"Great album, 4 stars for content, but only 1 star overall and I'd give it a zero if possible for copy protection. Please, for heavens sake, don't buy copy protected CD's like this one that prevent you from exercising your RIGHT to FAIR USE."
1,"No, please, no..","Their debut was spectacular. Why did they have to do this? I don't write reviews, ever, but I loved the spacey alt rock feel of the debut, and this is my chemical romance at its finest. Why? Jared! You have enough money, don't sell out on your music too."
5,"OKAY, I'M SOLD","I bought this CD despite the fact that an ""actor"" is the creative mind behind the music. I was surprised. It is a solid rock album. Jared Leto wrote the lyrics/music and plays guitar. And he's actually good. Wow. What a concept. I half expected to hear something similiar to that produced by the vomit-inducing crappola artists that Disney is spewing out in mass (Lohan, Duff, etc., etc., etc.) But not so. Deliver me from the endless onslaught of pop tartlets and sappy male pop bands (what's with all the male singers with high-pitched girly voices?) This CD is a relief from all that. Leto's vocals growl and soar. I am not a Jared Leto fan (trust me) but I do admire his passion for his craft, which is obviously music. This CD from 30 Seconds to Mars convinced me that there are still bands who have rock and roll coursing through their veins...bands who aren't afraid to bleed rock and roll. Loves it."
5,Impressed,"I am a new fan of 30 seconds to Mars and i was quite impressed. I must admit even though i love Jared Leto when i heard he was the lead singer of the band I kinda had my doubts. Let's face it actors turned singers just typically dont work out. However, I really like their sound. I think they are a little bit different than anything else I've heard. They have a unique song that I love. Plus their music videos tell a story and I absolutely love that. Give the song more meaning. So I am very impressed with 30 Seconds to Mars and like every song I've heard so far. I dont think all their songs sound alike. There may be a couple of similiarities hear and there but you really have that with any band. Especially if they write their own songs.In short I would definitely buy the album. The second is better than the first in my opinion."
5,I can't believe I put this one off,"After years of knowing of their existence, but yet not actually listening to the music itself, now after all this time I see what I have been missing from 30 seconds to Mars. To make it short and sweet, the songs on this album are powerful and filled with amazing energy. Jared Leto truly has a talent in the arts for sure. If you like rock music, you will love this. I have already ordered and have high hopes for the This is War cd."
5,30 segundos por siempre xD,"Para ser la primera ves que compro un cd sin dudarlo me pareco bien, esta económico, es una excelente banda con un pensamiento diferente y musicalmente muy bien elaborado, comprenlo si pueden no se arrepentiran."
2,what's wrong with you people?,"If you can actually explain to me how this band's sound has grown or matured, rather than simply saying that it has, I'd be amazed. Because the sad fact is this music is much more simple, and much less interesting. They've shown no growth whatsoever, quite the opposite. So, I'm not really sure what makes most of these reviewers think this album is better or even as good as the first. Take the first album; remove all the music but the guitar,bass, and drums; cut back the track lengths; dumb down the melodies; and change the lyrics to the same vague emotional crap other bands like Staind have been doing for years; and then you'll have some idea what this new album sounds like. It doesn't really sound like the Used though, which for some reason a lot of negative reviews have said. It just sounds like really boring, generic rock music, the same kind you can find from a myriad of other bands. This definitely does not have the somewhat unique sound of their first release."
1,"Not Terrible, but Far From Good Enough","Sorry, but the band took a couple big steps backwards after a really excellent 1st album.There is nothing to say is great here, so sadly they fell far short of their own standard of greatness. I agree with the reviewers who say it is hard to tell this is the same band. Kind of highschoolish, both in content and in production values.Maybe it was the great producer on the 1st album that made it happen so well, as Leto is so proud to say that their new guy is a peer in age - implying that the producer of Pink Floyd's ""The Wall"" is not really their style or up to their new and improved standard. I start to suspect that maybe it was not the band, but the producer who was the real artist?Hats off to the 1st album, really a landmark work of the decade. Better luck next time."
2,Disappointing...,"I was extremely excited when I found out 30STM was coming out with a new cd. I heard Attack and was like ""ok they tried something new with this one, I like it"". Well unfortunately, this song and The Kill are the only songs I liked. The others just didn't do anything for me. The spacey feel like on songs like ""Echelon"" and ""93 Million Miles"" from the previous album are completely gone, the lyrics are typical mainstream stuff and being a drummer, I was disappointed that the drums were a lot less interesting cool. I was let down by this one, hopefully 30STM can redeem themselves on the next CD and if not, at least we still have the first album to listen to."
4,Jared Lito is one talented dude.,"This guy is a gifted actor and a hit-making vocalist for a hard rock/metal band. Not too many artists can pull off what he does.I picked up their debut when it came out, and I was blown away with the futuristic sound, the imaginative song-writing, and the top-notch, soaring vocals.These guys really pack an emotional wallop. I'm not going to say they are really heavy, but this stuff sounds really good on my stereo. For this, their sophomore album, they strip down their futuristic sound and focus on driving riffs and tight songwriting, tossing away some of the quirkiness of the debut. This is in no way a bad thing, because it is a very solid album. No filler on here. They should be around for years to come, because they actually scored some hits off this album like ""From Yesterday"" and ""Attack"".4 1/2 stars."
