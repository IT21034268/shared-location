2,Nothing Short of Idiotic,"I waited to watch this on dvd instead of at the theater because I knew this one was going to be lame. Some parts of it were, ok. But the writing was somewhat desperate and very predictable. Blade was good, Blade 2 was killer and Trinity, well, very disappointing. Goyer's directing was terrible, not to mention looked a little amateur at best. Look at the shot of Triple H running after them after they escape the police station, WHAT IS THAT???? That looked way too ridiculous. Of course, there was nothing wrong with Wesley Snipes' performance, even though the movie was sickening he did a great job, as well as Jessica Beal (did I just say that???). The extras are alright and if you're a hardcore Blade fan, buy it, if not, you won't like this film, Goyer needs to leave the directing to the professionals."
1,Blade,"One of the worst films I've seen in awhile. Surprising for me to say because I am a quite a comic and action movie fan. But I didn't find anything special about this film. The story was a little far fetched, awakening Dracula to fight Blade and use his superior DNA to determine the key to daywalking. I guess this is the way for the movie to tie into the Tomb of Dracula comics in which Blade appears.Things I didn't like about this film: Whistler dies too quickly. The poor comedy/humour scenes of Hannibal King, a former vampire who adds too much silly comedy relief to what is supposed to be an action film. Scenes that have no bearing in the story (eg. warehouse blood processing facilty).There's nothing in this film which we haven't already seen in Blade 2. The previous films in this series are much better."
4,fun and definately better than the last one.,"I wasn't that happy with Blade II. It struck me as one of those films where the effects are more important than the story.This one made up for with some interesting casting choices and lots of good fight scenes.Ryan Reynolds portrail of Hannibal King as what could have happened to Van Wilder if things went really bad for him after college played well against the oh so badassed hardcase Blade. It also made up for the ""Buffy with Bow"" character played by Jessica Biel, although she did make nice eye candy.I'm not sure if casting Parker Posey was genius or just a fortunate side effect of the directory trying to get actors from A Mighty Wind in a Blade film (something that is both really cool and really wrong at the same time). I certainly liked her take on the role of a jaded Vampire.I wasn't so thrilled with the casting of Natasha Lyonne as the blind biotech genius, I kept waiting for her to talk about ""doubleclicking her mouse."""
4,funny and action packed,"in my opinion i think that this film is better than the second but not as good as the first. there is a lot of action and comedy in this installment and the combination works well. of course wesley snipes is blade the baddest vampire slayer around. he is still his very stoic self but still able to kick serious butt. jessica biel is a new edition to the mix as whistler's daughter (not sure if i spelled the name right). i loved her in this movie. not only is she hot but she can also kick your butt. the script also allowed her to show both the butt-kicking side but also her feminine, sensitive side. ryan reynolds is also a new edition to the mix. he provides great comic relief to the movie. one of the funniest moments comes against him and a vampiric pomeranian. i really enjoyed myself in this movie and the villainous dracula is very cool. go and see this movie, it is not a waste of time, in fact it will be a good action packe fun ride."
1,was this the best storyline they could think of???????,The first movie was awesome innovative and actioned packed.The second was luke warm but the third was terrible.The stroyline was toatally predictable boring and uninteresting.A good horror /action flick has got to have a strong story otherwise it's just wesly snipes on a routine vampire bashing job.Nothing really interesting happens....it was a total let down.And one more thing ----it was a bad action flick but a horrible comedy.(what was with all the jokes!!!!)---no further comment.buy the first movie it's the best.
1,How to confuse teens even more,"This book was incredibly inaccurate - not only about Mormonism but also the Jehovah's Witnesses. Its use of insulting and denigrating language was in extremely bad taste. (Who can forget p.141, where it says, ""That's the shot you need to kill the faith-eating bacteria of the cults.""?)There was little accuracy in this book. Even the definition of ""cult"" they use is made up;not to mention contradictory.If you want to learn how to insult other people, read it. If you want accuracy about their beliefs, read something else."
4,A Rosetta Stone for those confused about Christianity!,"Have you ever been visited by Mormons? How about Jehova's Witnesses? Ever notice how they all seem to have all the Bible references, while you have none to prove your point? Then this is indeed the book for you! ""...Dudes at the Door"" has all a young person, or even and adult needs to know about what these cults stand for, and how dangerous they can be just to talk to. A must read for any young Christian, or anyone young in the Lord!"
1,worst Callas performanc ever,"She tries to sound like Roberta peters, and the results are disastrous. She sounds old and tired, and down right ugly. Granted the coloratura is precise, but the voice behind it is wobbly and not pretty at all. If you are a Callas fan, I'll far recommend the Tosca or the Lucia, but this one is a major disappointment. But the other casts are not bad. But the set to have without doubt is the one with Pav/Sutherland. That is perfect. Trust me on this one ok?"
2,I wouldn't recommend,I bought this for a gift but it looked so cheap I just gave it to my son. It kept his attention for a day but that was it. There's no storage for the pieces and it just isn't made that well. The idea is a good one but I would have returned it if the shipping wasn't so expensive.
4,Cables To Go,"They sent the wrong cables. They did not have the item in stock when I called them (Cables To Go). However, they gave me the printer cable that was sent by mistake and my refund was in only a 2 days."
3,Doesn't work too well with my older Motorola Talkabouts,"Even though this unit comes with several different cups meant to accomodate different radio models, it doesn't work too well with my older Motorola Talkabouts. None of the cups makes for a snug fit and the radios just sort of rest loosly in the charger. It still works and they get charged, but you have to balance the radios just right in the charger in order for contact to be made so that the batteries get juice. And slightly bumping it will knock the radios around and you'll loose the connection. I suppose this is a non-issue with newer radios that I assume fit snugly and properly into the charger."
1,Didn't work,This product didn't work for our radios when it said they would in the discription.. The seller quickly took care of my claim and all was well! Just wish they would have worked.. My 8 yr old was disapointed..
3,not what it seems,"I thought these were batteries that could be charged while i used my radio. The picture is true, but it makes it look like it is a battery charger. They aren't. They must be in the radio to be charged. Unfortunately, the batteries don't last all day if you use them all day. We are communicating in a campground and i have to switch radios at about 4pm. We ended up sending these back and buying extra radios. Motorola, you need to make a BATTERY charger so i can charge the battery and switch when needed."
4,Allman Brothers 101,"This is a great boxed set. It covers all of the band's music from pre-Allmans to their nearly up to the present recordings. I say ""nearly"" up to the present because they have done a couple of more recordings that are not included on this album. Songs from the album ""Back where it all began"" are not included on this.I have all of their albums and I was impressed to see some really remote recordings here. My particular favorite is disc 3, but there are gems on all four discs.They were a remarkable band. I would highly recommend this boxed set."
5,Great purchase,"This is a hard product to find in any store, but if you do find dreams in a store you are one lucky SOB. Buying dreams was money well spent, not only do you get great best of and as well as songs from there earlier recordings you get a booklet of all the history on the allman brothers. I would definitely say if your a allman brothers fan this is one for the collection."
5,christmas gift,This was a Christmas gift and it was delivered on time. The recipient loved the item!
5,Gets the job done,The monitor splitter is working as it should and allowing us to use a monitor and a projector on our media center in the training room. Would recommend and the quality is still good
4,Works great,The splitter worked great in setting up an additional remote monitor on a security camera system. The quality of the splitter appears to be good.
1,Oh My Soul!,"Do they still make these? Folks, you cannot ""split"" a video signal without having issues. If you have one of these and it works, then you have a miracle. I can't tell you how many of these I've thrown in the trash at some customers site because of all the issues they create. You need a VGA DA to properly ""split"" the VGA signal, or a VGA card with multiple outputs. Avoid these type of devices like the plague."
2,I didn't get use out of it,"Instead of allowing me to use both my monitors, it mirrored the image and did a sub-par job of that. Not much more to say, could be useful in some cases."
2,Deceiving,I'm sure the device does a good job. But what is not clear is that the double screens are duplicates of each other so the only reason to get this is if you want someone else to see what you are up to remotely.
3,More ghosts,"I was trying to split my vga output to a monitor and a projector (via a 50 ft cable). I had the same experience with ghost images on my monitor as one of the previous reviewers. I'm guessing this splitter isn't designed to work with long cables. I ordered a 2-Port UXGA Video Splitter Extender (Cables To Go - 29550) which works much better, although it was somewhat more expensive."
1,Doesn't function very well,"This splitter will indeed split an image but if you plan to use a higher resolution such as 1280x1024, the problem is that the image on both monitors turns out dim because it simply splits the output from the video card without any sort of amplification. It would have been nice to know that before making the purchase. So if dim images are your thing then this is the product for you. Otherwise steer clear."
1,"Does NOT split, It MIRRORS.",Just to clarify this does not actually split your video as in creating a dual or extended monitor. If you are trying to use two monitors and want to be able to display two different images on them then this is the wrong product. I tried this on my PC and even if it did do the job of splitting the video the resolution was awful. I'm going to try the SEE2 USB 2.0 To VGA Ext Video.
1,Splits the quality of signal,I split the signal between my monitor and an LCD projector in my classroom attached to a 20 foot cord. The quality on the monitor become too poor for me to use. The brightness decreased and there was a ghosting or double vision kind of effect on the monitor. Our tech guy explained that you are splitting the quality of the signal in two.
4,Hooked up to the TV,"I have a 47"" TV that I watch Netflix on through the computer. It is nice to be able to hook it up as a monitor. This allows me to not have to unhook and hook up the normal desk monitor."
1,Fading screens with wiggly horizontal lines,When I plug the second item in to the y-splitter both screens fade to be almost unreadable with faint moving lines running across the screen. As soon as either the monitor or projector is unplugged it is fine. I will be returning this item.
1,Splitter puts lines on both screens,"I plugged this splitter into my brand new Dell computer.After it was plugged into both screens, they both had lines that made viewing unacceptable. I am now going to try a splitter with a booster for more money. You get what you pay for."
5,Did what I needed it to do,I bought this product to connect to monitors to the same computer. You do though need another video card to connect the two monitors to do separate tasks though. It works perfectly and I don't notice any difference in the two monitors in the area of quality.
3,It's ok,"The product works but it messes up the resolution on my Destop PC monitor I had to adjust it to get it to look ok. And i can see these ghost lines going down both my TV and monitor screens, kind of like when you have an old school analog antannae on your TV. But the product splits the signal as it says."
1,problems,recieved this splitter had a pin missing did not work! ordered a splitter amplifier instead.
5,Worked real well ...,This splitter worked real well for putting my TV into my computer system as one of the screens that I already had with my Computer. Then I extended the line with SVGA male to male to the TV.
2,not all that great,"i bought this product over amazon and gave it a try. for the price of the product and shipping, it came to a little over 12 dollars, not a bad price, but it was a bad product. one of the pins was broken and missing and there was a fuzzy image on my monitor. it's not all that great."
5,Works Great!,"I bought this product to split my desktop computer to my main monitor and to my HDTV in the other room. As others has said it does diminish the brightness on the monitor, but it hasn't done so on my HDTV. As I mainly use my computer on my HDTV these day I haven't had a problem with the lose of some brightness on my monitor at my computer desk. Besides for that little lost it works great as it was indented for."
1,Not recognizing specific monitors,"I plugged it in and both my 23"" HD monitor and my 42"" HDTV. They came on at 1024x768 resolution, with a max of 1660x1024 or something like that. The option for 1920x1080 wasn't even listed and my monitor showed up as ""Generic PnP Monitor"". Absolutely would not allow me to change it, even updating drivers. So, I had to plug my monitor into my PC directly, as before, and forget about splitting the signal to two monitors. Oh well, guess I need to buy a video card with 2 outputs. Live and learn."
5,Great way to segue from the old to the new,I recently acquired a new HD tv that could link to my computer via a VGA hook-up. GREAT for watching instant play options for netflix or full episodes offered for many tv shows. But switching between the monitor and tv screen was tedious and starting to loosen the computer terminal. This item fixed it easily and quickly.
4,maximum action,I am totally satisfied with this product--performs to my expectation & or more--the price and speed of arrival was awesome--thanks to all
4,Works ok.,"The Item will leave ""ghost images"", but works for the purpose. I dims my monitor and for a while I was going to get a amplifier. I still might later but for right now i am used to it."
3,Does not include arbor,"Amazon should make it more clear that this does not include the arbor. You can infer this from reading the technical details. The picture shows a complete hole saw ready to use but you only get the cutter. Moreover, the quick change arbor was not readily available from Amazon. Perhaps it is now. The cutter itself appeared well made but I returned item without using it."
3,okay quality,"I was looking for a strapless bra that was super low in the back. This one came close, but wasnt quite low enough for my dress. The quality is okay. I ended up returning it. I also bought a dominique bra that I like the quality of better."
2,Not supportive at all,"I purchased this bra for wedding day. I wanted support and a firm fit. This item is not firm, too flexible and actually ""the girls"" flopped over when tried it on. The issue is that the low back provided no support for the front and ribbing is not stiff enough to give support. Needless to say, I have to return it."
4,Took it back,"I, along with many others, was selling this in the Az Marketplace. It's not listed now, because I'm reading it again. There's a lot of nice reading in there. It's going for one cent, and, it's worth every penny. Just kidding. It's a really good book, a must-read."
3,It could help,"I wanted to see what a non christian book on forgiveness would look like. I had ahard time reading it & did not finish the book. But I guess it could help, but without the power of the cross, I really don't see how someone could truly forgive."
3,Captivating look at Indian life at the crossroads,Slow start but engaging and entertaining novella which portrays Indian culture at the crossroads with western influence. This story is written in such a way that we are as a fly on the wall to be privy to the personal and private goings-on presented with a slight mocking tone. An intriguing and smart read.
2,its cute,For the price I think you should get more. The o.ltd thing that looks real is the cake. This is not as good as there other toy food they have. I wouldn't recommend.
3,"Don't own it yet, BUT...","I'm very disappointed that at NO place in the description does the manufacturer or Amazon tell you what the toys are made of! (Except for the tablecloth, which I'd expect to be cloth, and that's plastic!!!) I'd ASSUME (and there's one slippery slope if ever I saw one) that everything else is also plastic, but why don't they tell us/me?"
4,A discovery,"Saraceni's poetry is a very fresh expression of the voice of exile. It combines loves, longing and pain."
2,Digging and Hunting through blocks of code,"I gave this book a trial run for a day of programming, in an effort to find a handy little reference book I could refer to when I forgot syntax or needed a function but couldn't find the name.I found the index suitable, but the descriptions of functions made lots of assumptions about what you should do, rather than present a clear explanation. Then, a large chunk of code is presented as an 'answer', with the inclusion of a lot of confusing parts. This is not a good phrasebook, but more of a skimpy tutorial book with a slant."
3,"Fun, but not worth the price","The Create your Own Goddess kit comes with a book, some clay, and a modeling tool. The book is the only thing worth buying in this kit, however, making the kit overpriced. The clay was like a rock, and even after soaking it in water for what seemed like ages, I found it difficult to use and mold. I threw it out and used Sculpey clay instead.The book is excellent, however. It talks about creating Goddess altars, gives meditations for each of the Goddesses presented, and lays out detailed instructions for creating the figures within. There are many Goddesses presented from many different cultures. Some of the statues are very simple to create, others require more skill, meaning it will take some time to grow out of the activities in this book.Buy the book, use Sculpey clay instead, and you've got an interesting activity for many meditative afternoons."
4,Berger Extended reach Pruners,"Berger #4075 Long Reach ShearThis is a great Pruner, sturdy and well made. The grip is a little wide for my hand but I was able to manage very well. I trimmed my apple tree easily. I was able to reach into the center for thinning and I loved the gripper that holds the cutting so it doesn't fall to the ground. Great for pruning roses and overhead branches. I would highly recommend this Pruner."
3,volume 2,"is crude childlike and simple but the beautifull thing about any of his recordings, is that they are real. if you truly want to know where merengue roots come from listen to this guy. his group carried the original lineup of merengue conjunt Guira, tambora & acordeion it doesn't get any more real than this."
4,Boppy Slipcovers,"These slipcovers are handy. They make it easy to change out when baby spits up (or other such messes) on the boppy. The paisley one is not as stretchy of material as the green one (nor is it as soft) and did recently tear a bit at the seam, although it is an easy fix. Overall I am happy with the product."
2,Not worth the money!,"I don't have this exact slipcover (it's a different pattern), but it's not worth it to buy one. Here's why: they are thin cotton, so if the baby spits up, drools, drips, etc., it goes right through to the Boppy and you have to wash it anyway - except now you have two things to wash! I suppose it helps against dirt or anything that isn't liquid, but I found that the main culprit in forcing me to wash the Boppy was liquid. Not worth the money!"
3,Forbidden fruit,"Manning's nearly forgotten novel is among those set in girls' boarding schools. Rachel is a bright student who befriends one of the school's rebels, Margaret. They are surrounded by teachers who dress as men and act with stoney authority. Margaret brings a copy of ""The Well of Loneliness"" into the school, and eventually gets caught with another girl, thereby implicating Rachel in her activities. Rachel is faced with the hypocrisy of the school's staff and with her own growing sensuality, and ultimately must betray her friend or suffer her fate. What I found most remarkable about the story was Manning's use of complex metaphors paralleling the story of Adam & Eve's ingestion of knowledge. It may be a dated story, but there's still much in which to delight."
3,Interesting but Slow,"Rachel is a young girl residing at Bampfield, a boarding school that regards its students as masculine and embraces independence. Here Rachel hates the Bampfield regime, but finds pleasure in garden not far from the school grounds. Its Oriental theme and beauty captivate her. This is her refuge away from her academia life.At Bampfield, Rachel is surrounded by friends: the almost-impossible Margaret the needy Bisto. Margaret is the 'rebel' who introduces her to the garden and tells her about a new book, 'The Well of Loneliness,' which is creating quite a stir because of its 'racy' theme.I won't give away much more, but naive Rachel comes of age in this novel. She learns about the true nature of people, especially when a controversy arises within the book. I enjoyed the language of 'The Chinese Garden' although the real meat of the story comes at the far end. I was waiting patiently throughout the book -- it was definitely worth the wait."
3,depends,"Wow, alot of disturbed fans have really bad english! This cd sucks it's not a statement against this band (i love this band) but the recording was of poor quality you hear loud static in the back ground. I know there was nothing wrong with the copy i bought it was brand new so that means that the recording was bad."
4,Rest softly,"An overall beautiful effect, gracefully sung, unfortunately poor acting in the melodrama sections mar this album. But the lovely arias, each repeated variously, will make this an ethereal experience. Particularly charming is the aria ""Ruhe Sanft""."
3,listen while getting dressed or cooking,"julie gold is an amazing songwriter. you can just imagine a carol king,bette midler,barbara striesand or linda ronstadt gettin a hold of these and making them number 1 on the charts. while juli gold""s voice is lovely her songwriting is much stronger. she is special. i would buy all of her work if i could find it."
3,Heart of Gold,"You won't buy this CD to hear someone with a voice quality like Barbra Streisand, but there is a real appeal to this disc. Julie Gold is a great songwriter. As part of the Four Bitchin' Babes, she added some great tunes including ""Try Love"" which in a perfect world would be a pop standard and is the title tune to this CD. ""Teach Us"" is a beautiful God-love song, one for the New Pop Hymnal. ""The Ride"" is a beautiful tune about enjoying the ride of life, short as it may be. Gold's piano is passionate. She gets a little wacky as with the abbreviated but clever ""Temporary Song."" If you are as interested in those who write the songs as those whose records get on the airwaves, this is a CD to enjoy. Gold is more Carole Bayer Sager than Carole King, but she has a beautifully strong muse and should not be missed!"
5,The Best Book of The Series up to now,"In my opinion, while writing Book #4 of the Wheel of Time Series, Robert Jordan has outdone himself. The plot is well-developed and the author gives equal attention to the deeds of all characters. The story - line moves slowly but firmly, leaving unanswered just a couple of questions. Though Book #4 is more tightly connected with its sequel than the preceeding books of the series, it is clearly the one in which the reason for the Battle against the Dark One is specified thoroughly. When making alliance of all eight books in the series - the frist three could be viewed as Introductory, and with Book 4 starts the real part. It poses questions to be resolved later -in books 5, 6, 7, 8, etc. and at the same time answers almost all vague story - line problems, which were left unanswered in the preceeding books.It's definitely better than all its prequels!!!"
4,Great continuation of a story,"While Robert Jordan obviously felt that the story would not be contained in three books, leading up to the original climatic scene in book 3, he led well into book 4. The shadow Rising goes further into character developement and extends the story into other possible lines. The fact that you never know exactly what will happen keeps the book(s) a good read. Book 4 allows more character depth and slows the pace of the original stories somewhat.In the end, it makes book 4 a great read to those who believe the story and want more information.Overall, a great supplement to fast paced action of the first three"
3,A discontented rumble,"Although I enjoyed this book as an afternoon's read, I did not find it as engrossing as the previous installments in this series. The plot drags considerably as Jordan delves ever more deeply into local color and points of characterization that have either already been made, or are easily imagined by the reader.In fact, that's my chief complaint about this novel, which I found far less memorable than its predecessors: there's so much detail bogging down the story that ultimately, very little actually happens. While there was enough buildup in the first three books to allow for a fourth to wrap things up, instead we have new plot points, new characters, and a lot of other things that bring us no closer to the climax.I find myself thinking, as this series goes on, that Jordan should have taken a leaf from Michael Moorcock's Eternal Champion, and told us the stories of several Dragons, rather than just one"
2,I honestly don't know why I read it.,"Seriously. They did NOTHING in 980 pages.I just DO NOT CARE about the hair color and 'seductive eyes' of a merchant's wagon driver. Jordan may find it more beneficial to make Rand a little less crazy (what's up with the main character going bonkers? Nothing to do with his 'taint') and Moiraine a little less meddlesome than to prattle on and on about some very low cut dresses. That really annoys me. Nynaeve & Egwene, if it's even possible, are even more annoying.I really can find precious little good about this book.PS: how many sinuous lines can one thing have in four pages?"
3,A Great Book With Many Suprises,"This book in the wheel of time series will suprise you in many ways. Rand now has the sword that is not a sword, one of the most powerful sa'angreal ever. But there's worry in the air because of the Forsaken, and Rand needs an army and fufilling another prophecy isn't having the exact results. So Rand does the unexpected and gets ahead of them all.A must for Robert Jordan and Wheel of Time fans. You won't regret it."
3,I just can't do it anymore,"I just couldn't do it anymore. I loved this series but it should have ended about to books ago. I just couldn't go any further. When reading starts to feel like a trip to the dentist, it's time to quit."
1,Not Jordan's best,I read through books 1-3 very quickly but found this installment to be a drudgery. This is not Jordan at his best. The story got bogged down with too many details like page after page after page of walking through the desert. By this time in the story there seem to be too many characters to keep up with for me. Coupled with the news that Mr. Jordan passed away before completing the series made me put the book down before I finished it. I don't plan to read book 5.I would like to offer my condolences to the family of Robert Jordan. May God comfort you in your loss.
1,ugh,"I've read this book before, in the early 80s. It was written by David Eddings and it was titled, ""Pawn of Prophecy."" It featured the young farmer of unknown parentage who sees a mysterious shadowy cloaked figure trailing him at times--but it's always gone. It has a blacksmith of virtue and oh-so-practical values who doesn't like to hurt people or be called ""Lord."" It has a mysterious dark-haired, beautiful sorceress who is very imperious, allows no nonsense, and can often be found brushing her hair before bed. It also has an old storyteller who has more skills and knowledge than others would believe--he's more than he appears. Oh, and there's a connection between the main characters and wolves. Jordan has ripped off most of these elements in this book but FAILS to cite his source, which to me makes this plagarism."
4,Review on The Shadow Rising,"The Shadow Rising of The Wheel of Time series is a really good book. The series itself is good. Each book describes the characters and what is happening with them. It explains their personal feelings and emotions. In his books you get into each individual character. In the Shadow Rising, it always has wanting to know what will happen next. It keeps you guessing, but not too much though. This is defenitely a good book to read. I suggest that if you were to read the series, to start at the beginning with The Eye of the World."
4,A pretty interesting read,It continues after the ending of the Dragon Reborn and goes strong. It's fun to read and keeps me interested. I'm about half-way through and I'm loving the way the characters and their world is developing. I found I could relate to Mat the most out of them all.
4,the shadow rising [the wheel of time],"i like the story from the beginning, since the first wheel of time i red. i havent finish reading this book, but i liked it and i will finish it soon."
1,"""Wheel of Time"" audio book","Package arrived without damage. The package was opened and the items/discs appeared usable. However, upon closer inspection, I found that the package contained duplicates of discs and not the whole book. I called your provider with my discovery. The only help I received was that the amount of my purchase would be applied back to my credit card. There was no offer to help me to correct the issue. I was ""brushed off"". I received poor customer service."
1,Had to wade through tons of trash...,"I have read the first 5 books so far and in my opinion, this book is the worst! it has over 1000 pages but I dont see anything of much interest. The first 200 pages were fine.But than the book deteriorates rapidly after that.Nyanaeve with her grumblings, Rand's non-stop quarelling with Moraine and Wise ones. A thousand pages & Rand is still not much nerarer to uniting the Aiel than before.The only part worth reading is Perrin in Two Rivers.While introducing the Aiel customs is new, this business of describing every Aiel, Ship captain & soldier is rediculous!I would strongly recommend skimming through the parts on Elayne & Nynaeve, but read in detail on Perrin & Min.Bye!^_^"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Rand is now super scary guy. Generally, a woman named Selene is going to be super scary girl. In this case, yep. She is one of the Forsaken. Whines quite a bit less than the rest of the women they have to put up with in this story, too.Perrin and Faile go back home to beastie's town, and the Aes Sedai politics get violent."
5,Continues to be good,I thought the books would have to get less interesting as the series progressed but I have to say I've enjoyed every single book in the series to date. Definitely recommend.
5,Love these books,"Great read this series has me hooked. So many characters I can't wait to catch up with them! Rand, mat, perrin are my heroes!!"
4,fast service,"I recieved very fast service, I got my book in three days! The package arrived even before you said it would, good work!"
5,The Shadow Rising,"It was without a doubt one of the best books my son has ever read in his life! In the Fantasy realm it tops the chart for story line, action and adventure."
4,Shadow rising,"I'm into the 4th book. Yes the writing in general can be laborious and weighted. If I was Robert Jordan I would cut some of the fat (filler) but fortunately I am not Robert Jordan. While the pace can be slow, the wait is worthwhile. No it is not the Lord of the Rings but who cares. I'm glad I was not his editor because I would had slash and trim here and there. Yea, I got frustrated sometimes and felt he needed to be a little more pointed.No I don't have a short attention span. Yes some readers have to be patient with Mr.Jordan. He is not the smoothest writer but he holds my attention. In general a very fine series after all it is a series. Some of the reviewers need to be a little less thin skin. Some of the critics were valuable. It is not just take or leave it but a little more complex. It is all about his style. Kudos for the series, I'm still reading his series!The Shadow Rising: Book Four of 'The Wheel of Time'"
3,not quite as good...,"Let's just get it out of the way...the book was too long. That said, it was still full of good moments. I enjoyed Perrins part in the story in particular, he's really coming into his own as an independant character. I liked Mats involvement in book 3 much more than this one. And RAND, finally making some decisions instead of just reacting and running scared. I really enjoyed his displays of strength (at last) and willingness to take charge. For the most part the female characters are still pretty annoying (except Min). I agree with one reviewer who said the Aes Sedai spend too much time working against Rand instead of with him. Don't get me wrong, this is a really solid book with plenty to keep you iterested. It just doesn't quite live up to the incredibly high standards set by the rest of the series so far. I'm still looking forward to reading the next books."
3,Not the best of the series,"I love this series but this book left something to be desired. I think it was the worst of the series, but if you can power through then you'll be able to enjoy the rest of the 14 books like I did."
3,Frustrating,"Great story, plot development and characters. Unfortunately, there are many, many, many, many characters. There is a glossary, but it is missing most of the characters and descriptions that are hard to recall. Be prepared to take notes, or search the internet to figure out who some of the characters are."
3,worth reading,"The story is as gripping as the first three books, a definite page turner. My one disappointment was that unlike the first three, this volume doesn't work on my iphone with whispersync. I have to manually search where I left off from the ebook edition to/from the audible audio edition. On my iphone, for instance, the book's chapter indexes do not take me in the audio file to the start of the chapters; the text-to-audio matching is incorrect. Read the book or listen to it, but don't count on whispersync to help you with this one."
1,Macmillan/TOR price increase,"Macmillan has increased the price for this ebook, so they are now charging more for the zero per-unit-cost ebook than the paperback. In this pricing dispute with Amazon, Macmillan has claimed that the concern was about newly released books. This book has been in print for more than a decade. Any costs associated with producing this book we recouped a thousand fold before anyone ever thought of selling the ebook. Given that the cost to Macmillan of the ebook is essentially zero, Macmillan is now charging an unreasonable price for this ebook."
3,"Not as good as the first 3, but a must read...","Okay, These books are ill right (that means good), the first 3 are hella tight(which also means good), this fourth one kinda drags at parts, and no chapter really stand out like in the others. But, the main deal about the WoT is that you should read them all and in order.-Dont waste your money on the hard cover, youll thank me when you buy the paperback...-If you can check out a summary of the chapter if it starts getting dull, so you can get a better idea of where things are going...Okay, on to book five...Is it Ail (like ginger) or A-EEL (electric)"
2,I tried to get through this twice and failed...,"I loved the first three books. I burned through them. From reading reviews of the later books, it all goes down hill eventually. For me, I thought this book lacked the excitement of the first three. As the post title indicates, I have tried to read it two times now and could not get past around page 200. Maybe I will try again, but, as a reviewer, I have to say that there is a lot of fantasy out there to read and this is too plodding to please the true adventure seeker!"
4,"Decent, but too spread out.","Read this book for the parts on Perrin. The rest is interesting, but not quite enough."
4,Very good read,I enjoyed this edition of the Wheel of Time very much. I thought the side story of Perrin's problems in Emond's Field really stood out and took hold of this book. Now its on to Book 5.
5,Very Good!,I have to say that this the best book in the WoT series. I was so happy to see that Robert Jordan wrote more about Perrin in this book. I hope he continues to include him a lot more in all the future books. I think this book was excellent and would tell anyone who is a fan of great fantasy to read this series.
5,Jordan shows a gift for weaving subtelty where few can see.,"I am saddened that so few people can see this book for the work it really is. Of course it seems slow, can't anyone else see that it is setting the stage for the great works that are to follow? Rand is not a muttering madman, he is putting his Two Rivers stubborn personallity into the work he knows he has to do. The underlying plots are woven together with subtlety, something that few people seem to be able to understand. Perhaps they don't read the glossary at the back of the book. It's there for a reason!"
5,Most interesting book of the series.,We finally get some big glimpses back into the age of legends and the history of the Aiel. Very interesting. I love this kind of stuff.
2,"PLAN, PLAN, PLAN AND NO ACTION!!!","The fourth book of WoT series, its better than previous three.But still its not as good as others are claiming it to be. First of all, I want to know what the hell was Rand's Masterplan?? In the entire book, Rand and others act as though he has come out with an ultimate plan to defeat the enemies. But when the climax happens the plan is never mentioned by anybody. And I think its the tradition of WoT series that everytime the villians are explained as very strong, cunning and powerful, but when they confronts with Rand, they are so easily won over as though they were waiting for him only to screw them up. The females...... more female characters are introduced and they doesnt show any kind of difference from previous female characters, all are rude and ignorant. Even the Aeil woman are annoying.I'm saying again, dont bother to go for this series."
1,Same old,"I enjoyed the 1st book of the series, however, by the time I reached book four I could care less about most of the characters. In addition, I found myself interested in only a few of the many plots, and completely fed up with the writing style (every woman is folding their arms under their breasts, and every man's face, it seems, is ""carved out of stone""). I awaited a likable female character, but only manipulative annoyances were introduced. I know this sounds like a cliche, but I honestly wanted some of the main characters to be killed off, although I got the impression that the author intended for me to like these characters. One last side note to those who read these reviews: I have found it helpful to skip the reviews that claim that the book in question was THE best or worst book ever written."
5,"an exciting,well-written adventure","Robert Jordan writes with the stark vision of light and darkness,and sometimes childish sense of wonder. The Shadow Rising is a complex tapestry of fascinating characters,descriptive details and events. I highly recommend this book and the whole series to anyone who loves epic fantasy."
4,Can an author of such quality become bored?,"Jordan uses description, settings, people, and philosophy with the skill of Faulkner, Twain, and Dickens. He even goes so far as to make the material enjoyable and brings a fantasy world to life. Unfortunately, all of his talent appears to dry up in the last 3 chapters. In these final 3 chapters, his descriptions are sketchy, the writing is jumbled, and he changes his descriptive style by forcing the cumulation of many unanswered questions and plots into a few pages. Changing writing styles so dramatically destroys the 628 pages he used to develop these questions and plots. The reader is either left wondering why Jordan didn't take the time to finish the book properly; or instead condense the whole book to 200 pages or less. Inspite of this small flaw I will continue to read his work and enjoy them."
4,Great!,"Well, I thought this book was wonderful! I love the proggression of Perrin, but some people might think that he was mentioned to much. Poor Rand! He must choose between Min, Aviendha, Elayne, and his brotherly feelings toward Egwene. Faile is a rather annoying little chit. She controls everything! Mat is sooooooo interesting. I wish that he would have gone into the ter'angreal with Rand, at Rudhiean. It would have been cool to see what his past ancestors did, and to have him, a wetlander at that, become a clan cheif. Egwene and her bunch are too prominent in this book, half of the book is about their terrible lives."
5,I loved this book!!,"I've read the entire series of The Wheel of Time, and, so far, this one is the best. If you were disapointed (as I was) with the third book, this maked up for it!! Many of the former problems are resolved, and some new twists are introduced. You get to know some of the characters better, and some of them have very intriguing backgrounds.In conclusion: Great book, everyone should read it!"
5,A great loss ends eventually with a nod to his style,"I was sad to hear that Robert Jordan died when writing the second to last book in this series. I had read all but the last book of The Wheel Wheel of Time and highly suggest reading ALL of them. Great imagination, epic in its vivid and detailed drive. When the second to last book was finished by another writer, I was skeptical. It felt a bit different than RJ's work, a bit lack luster but I will get the final book and finish the tail with my imagination inserting how RJ writes into the book if I find it out of his character. When I find an author I like, I read everything they have ever published. RJ is one of the greats and is missed by this reader/fan."
4,The WOT enters a new phase,"With the Shadow Rising, Jordan's narrative takes a turn away from mainly adventure mode, and starts mixing in a lot of political intrigue. It's not too bad in this book, but it definitely becomes a problem in later books. The trip to Rhuidean produces numerous repercussions down the road, and the historical backstory is quite interesting and adds good depth. However, it was in this book that Faile really grated on me, and I can't help but cringe every time I see her name in subsequent books. This is also the last book where all plot lines complete the mission they set out to do within the same book. Overall, a good read and relatively tight narrative."
3,I quit,The story is entertaining and most the characters (all male) are realistic and enjoyable but the women are just too annoying. I've never read a book with so many occurences of people glaring at one another. Robert Jordan needs to cut most of the bickering between characters and move this story along. The reviews for these books only go downhill from here so I'm doing what Matt should have done; left the women behind. Shame on Jordan's editor too. It's their job to cut out the crap and this book is gold buried in a huge pile of crap.
2,STOP NOW!,"The usual cast of interesting characters and a (relatively) fast moving plot generate enough action to maintain the reader's interest. The tale of the seige of Two Rivers with the intertwined love story of Perrin and Faile is very well done. There is even progress in some of the other threads in this bloated epic.Unfortunately, this is the last book in the series worth the time or money. Someone desperately needs to remind Mr. Jordan that he's not getting paid by the word. Of course, if he is it would explain a lot about the agonizingly slow and plodding nature of the rest of the series."
4,The Story Gets Better With Every Book,The Shadow Rising is a continuation of Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time fantasy series. This book was great; it continued the interesting stories of Rand and his companions. Things really get moving in this one and the action never stops. A must buy for fans of the series.
3,it's really slowing down,"Maybe Jordan peaked too soon, or maybe there's a hidden meaning somewhere that will pop up later. (I hope) this one took me a bit longer to read, mainly because I just couldn't get into it at all. It was, however, a good book because you got to know the others characters better. Like Perrin always had that window dressing theme until this book, and Mat got a better look, it was ... interesting to see what make him tick. I was relived to see the three boys start acting like young men rather than the past ""goody two-shoes"" they all seemed to be growing up. I love how shy Perrin is and also how life like. I loved the book mainly because I loved getting more of Perrin. I reccomend reading this book just for the insight on the characters besides Rand."
3,This is a question,"I'm really distressed because when I was reading this book I realized that there might be a mistake. Master Bayle Domon was supposed to have met Thom Merrilin in 'The Eye of the World' because he almost stumbled in his ship fleeing from some Trolocs. This happened just before they arrive in Whitebridge. Then, when they meet again in Tanchico they don't seem to know each other. Is this a mistake or am I wrong? What the heck was Mr. Jordan thinking about when he wrote this Chapter? Please help me."
1,Just ain't what it used to be,"This is just a terrible book. That's too bad, because the first three were so good. Robert Jordan tries to put too much romance in this one, and it comes across as lame. The plot isn't nearly as epic or dramatic as the previous three. This book, in fact, has caused me to stop reading the series. For newcomers, I reccomend reading the first 3 books. For fans looking into #4, skip it."
3,"story is great, condition of product not acceptable.",what can be said when the first 25 pages of the book were missing.Difficult to ascertain flow of story without the first 25 pages. Had been looking foward to reading the next book in the series. Now must attempt to fill in the gap.
5,Fraud Prevention Saves Millions,I have read and re-read this fantastic book by Jim Blanco. What an insight into the world of scams and schemes. Things I now know to watch for. I am a retired correctional officer and thought I heard them all but Blanco's book told me more. I would recommend this book to any business or individual that is serious about not being a victim.
4,Psychology,I'm studying psychology for school and this book was all right to get you started. You will need to read other books to help you alone the way.
2,Very Very Dated,"When I got to the part about how people who are obsessed with maintaining routines and habits become vegetarians, that struck me as strange because becoming a vegetarian would involve changing, changing that could be avoided by simply not making the change. Then when he said in his opinion a good smoke (as with a cigarette) is a good thing, I thought I'd delete this book from my Kindle and spend my reading time on other material. Of course, everyone smoked back in the author's day, but I'm trying to learn something useful, not what people thought back then."
3,Not so compatible with most sets.,Great assortment of bits for any project. Only three stars bc I bought it with a B&D drill and the description of the set said it was compatible with most drills yet the drill bits in this set have no hex mount! Those seem to be made for drills that you have to use a key to lock into place. All of the screwdriver bits in this set have the B&D hex mount. I guess I would need some sort of adapter but that is not in this set. My main peeve is that I selected the drill first and the Amazon site recommended buying this 66 p set with it- so I assumed complete compatability.
2,66 piece drilling/screw driver set,"This item is being displayed along with some of Black & Decker chordless screwdrivers. The screw driver bits work fine, but the drill bits do not fit the PD600 chordless screwdriver at all. Purchased another brand of drill bit & screwdriver bits that have the proper fitting ends for the electric screwdriver chuck."
2,Didn't fit drill,"I bought a cordless Black & Decker screwdriver/drill combination. Correctly assuming that there would be little selection of bits included, I looked to the section of Amazon.com that tells you what other consumers purchased with the screwdriver/drill. This set was shown, so I purchased it to fit my new screwdriver/drill. Unfortunately, the screwdriver/drill was a ""quick connect"" model and the bits didn't fit properly. I found the correct bits at a store near home. The ""quick connect"" feature should be part of the description so matching additional bits would be easier."
1,Bits don't fit,"By definition a ""set"" means that they go together. Well the bits don't fit this drill! Bad! Don't get it. The drill itself is nice, but try to find the right set."
3,Highly useful- hard to keep organized,Unless you keep the case locked the contents will easily spill. The case contains screw head suitable for US an metriMetrik size small requirements.
2,"*NOT* a Variable Speed Screwdriver, which is a BIG drawback","You have to be really good at guessing when to release the button --or you will over-tighten and/or damage the screw you are driving.Imagine driving a car with a stick shift and ONLY 3rd and Reverse gears.Everything else about the unit is well-designed, too bad.Wish I had read the web page more carefully before ordering."
5,Challenging workout for advanced ball users,"So it's not the most exciting exercise DVD, but it's challenging. I've only done the first 2 workouts and each time I work up a sweat. I am looking forward to moving on to workout 3."
2,Dull!,This was a big waste of money for me. I ordered all three of his dvd's and found many of his movements too hard to balance safely. The workouts are extremely dull and uninspiring and not sustainable. He is obviously good at what he does but does not have the ability to make a workout fun or interesting.
2,Motorola Battery Replacement,"I don't give many bad reviews, but I will in this case. I bought two of these batteries at the same time. One went south in about one month. The other lastest about 6 months. I don't know if they were old stock or Motoroal knock offs. I would not buy them again. Two stars is generous for this battery."
3,Battery charger,"When I ordered this product I thought it was my answer to recharging all batteries but alas, it does not do a good job on non ni-cad batteries."
5,Walkie Talkies,"Ordered for my sons walkie talkies and these were an off brand battery where I was able to get 2 for ten dollars. Instead of about 13 dollars each. Great price, and work great."
5,Plug-n-play without issue because its the true OEM replacement,It was worry free and fit perfectly as its a true OEM replacement. Separate from this I also bought some upgraded capacity batteries from Hong Kong but we'll see how those work in comparison. I'm glad I found these true OEM battery here though at a good price to ensure I have a reliable swap long term as I suspect those other batteries I bought from Hong Kong will die off quickly but only time will tell.
5,Do NOT buy this - get it free,"Yes, this is an essential guide. Yes, it has virtually everything you would need. However, you do not need to pay a dime for it...especially not 50 bucks! As other reviewers have suggested, head to doublejumpbooks (add .com to get there). They are now offering this strategy guide as an e-book as a FREE download. If you're still working through this great game...I highly recommend the download...just don't drop a ridiculous amount of money on it!"
3,Orthopedic Nursing Secrets,"OK. Thought it would have more postop nursing care. Felt like it was a waste of money. Would not recommend for an experienced nurse, would be disappointed as I was."
2,Some Colors dont stick!,All of the Yellow in this HUGE bucket of magnetic letters & Numbers do not stick.
2,Not Worth the Money!,I bought this for my grandson for his 5th birthday because he loves putting magnetic things on my refrigerator. He quickly became bored with this. I think it was just way too many items in the tub. Not worth the money I paid for this. Recommend you go to the dollar store instead for no more time a child will play with it!
4,"symbolism, an interior art","Wonderful book for art research. Short and very to the point, but also throughly informative on the different artists that manifested the ideals of the Symbolists. The vivid pictures, half in color, half in black and white, are filled with dreamlike images and an escapist attitude that the fin de siecle embodied."
1,Avoid the New Page Press Edition,"If you care at all about books' content and appearance, avoid spending your hard-earned money on this edition. A classic Evans-Wentz's book may be, but New Page Books, the publisher of this edition, has made it look ridiculous by punctuating the text with cheap clip-art style doodles. Almost every page is defaced by art that's silly, cartoony, and does little to illustrate or advance the author's argument.An even worse crime against Evans-Wentz's work is the incompetent typesetting. Even a casual glance reveals howlers: ""uncivilized"" has become ""tin-civilized""; ""Karnak"" is turned into ""Karnab."" Was there even a cursory attempt at proofreading? A professional publisher wouldn't have let this monstrosity see the light of day.If you buy books just to keep them on the shelf, this edition may be fine for you. If actually intend to read this book, find another edition."
5,Anyone interested in the Faery Faith must read this book.,"""The Fairy Faith in Celtic Countries"" is written by W.Y. Evans-Wentz, the same scholar who brought us ""The Tibetan Book of the Dead"". Evans-Wentz gathered the information for this book at the turn of the century. He travelled extensively in Ireland, Scotland, Britain, Wales and Brittany, interviewing those who had enjoyed close encounters of the third kind with the Fair Folk or who knew those who had first hand dealing with the Shining People. ""The Fairy Faith in Celtic Countries"" is a source document non-pareil and an absolute must read for anyone with a serious interest in the Faery Faith."
1,The Fairy Faith in Celtic Countries,"I have to agree with those who posted one star ratings on these newer editions. I would also avoid the edition by NuVision. Both of these publishing companies seem to have the same errors. Maybe they share the same bad editing department and computer program.I finally found an older edition that seems to be much better. This edition is from the Citadel Press - Carol Publishing Group, published in 1990. The older versions are far better and worth the trouble of tracking down if you can find one."
1,AVOID New Page edition,"I wanted a cheap edition to mark up with notes- but I had no idea that this publisher would be so careless as not to proofread or quality check the work. There were typos- sometimes several to a page, such as ""Foik"" or ""Fdk"" for ""Folk"", periods randomly placed in the middle of sentences, lines that would shift up a fraction of a line (as if they were superscripted but the font size remained the same). It was a headache to read. On top of this, Pages 443/444 and 453/454 (which are the same sheet of paper) were torn clear across the bottom half, yet sewn into the book as is- so I can't even read those pages!) I had already been reading and note taking up to this point so I don't think I could return it now, even though its obvious on inspection this damage happened in the assembly of the book."
3,Celtic Fairy Faith,"This book provides insight into the psyche of the Celtic people during the early 1900s. It shares mostly stories but also experiences that were passed along word of mouth by many people in their nineties. The similarities of the stories in various parts of the Celtic world offered a view of the times, how they saw sickness, illness and even death of family members, friends or domesticated animals by explaining the cause as fairy activity. The belief in the unseen world of fairies and its ""Fairy Faith"" was changing with the times. Religion, education and industrialization were suggested as some of the causes for a lack of belief in fairies as well as for the reasons fairies were not as popular or numerous in numbers as in earlier centuries."
2,Not what I expected,"Too many examples of ""fairies"" and not enough about the theory of this belief and how it affected the daily lives of the Celts."
3,this is ok,"this book takes you into the world of celtic folklore and their ties with faeries. for fairy lovers this book is a must, and for anyone hoping to know a little more about our little friends this is a good start. a great read for the first time fairy reader as well as the expert"
2,Lotus 1-2-3 for Macintosh,"This version was for Mac OS 9 (also called Mac Classic). Classic support was dropped from OS X years ago when Apple went to the Intel processor line, so you cannot run this software on the newer Macs."
2,Sexy but,If it's soft core porn there's not enough sex. If its a horror movie there's not enough drama and tension. It's a B movie and not a particularly outstanding one.
4,enjoyable,"I enjoyed this book quite a lot and thought it was sweet. But having just finished HARMONY, I found this book not as good. I thought that HARMONY was great and I was ready to laugh again."
5,Student of The Word,"This book is written in simple, easy to understand language. The scriptural references are revalent to the subject matter. I would recommend highly to all new Christians. Good book for devotionals and Bible study."
1,"Good at first, but didn't last","I agree with the two above reviews as far as they go, but I've had mine for a year now, and it now makes the weakest coffee on earth. At first, running it through the cleaning cycle solved the problem, but now nothing helps. I use twice the amount of coffee I used to use to get the same result. That's an expensive cup of coffee!!! I also run it through the cleaning cycle once a week (I only make coffee once a day, so that's excessive.) Not to mention the hassle of having to clean it so often. It takes an hour to run through the clean cycle, and then you have to make a full pot of hot water twice to clean the vinegar/cleaning solution out of the coffee maker. I just cleaned it yet again, made coffee, and it tastes like muddy water."
3,Mixed feelings,"I've had and used this coffeemaker daily for about 4 years. I also received a stainless steel carafe version of it, but that's another story... I gave that one away. Anyway, this one has the glass carafe. All in all, it's been pretty good, but as it ages, there are several issues developing.Pros:- Makes a pretty good cup of coffee- Is programmable, and fairly convenient to do so- Has an adjustable warming plate settingCons:- Not easy to tell if basket is properly seated, resulting in overflow and MESS- Mine has controls with very small black lettering on red background; VERY hard to read- Does not always pour well"
2,I'd pass on this one...,"Within a couple weeks of getting this coffee pot, we had an overflow incident. All over the counter. Then it would brew only half and stop. So I read the manual and did the clean cycle, even only after this short of period. It would work okay for awhile, and then do the same thing. Or often grounds are in our coffee or tea. Cleaning it doesn't help any more."
1,Another Piece of Chinese Junk,"Mr. Coffee (Sunbeam Products) is just another case of a supposed American company pawning off Chinese junk on American consumers. I bought this coffee maker less than a year ago and about a week ago, it just quit. It is just as well, because I was getting tired of luke warm coffee. After it died, I decided to take it apart just to see the quality of the construction. All I can say is that this thing is JUNK! JUNK! JUNK!"
2,not the one,"worked ok for a couple weeks, then started having overflow problems, then it pluged up and would not draw the water into the heating element. I have very soft water but cleaned it anyway, slight help for about 2 brews. This machine is simply poorly designed. If you try to make a full pot of coffee, water does not flow out of grounds fast enough and it backs up and runs over making a huge mess and plugging it self up. Mr. Coffee should be ashamed of this piece of junk."
2,Buy something else,"This coffee pot lasted 7 months. Just slowly stopped working. Started with coffee grounds in my coffee, then not very hot. Today not working at all brewed 4 cups and died. The clock never did work properly like all the other models and I doubt I will buy another. Not sure why but the cheapest coffee pot you can buy with no frills seem to run longer than med or expensive pots. I seem to be going through coffee pots one after another cheap foreign crap.---Good luck to you finding quality."
2,Decent product but has its issues.,"I have used this coffee maker for just over two years and have only had a few problems:1. The decanter is not well made. The lining cracked within the first month of usage and has since leaked every time.2. I usually brew small pots (2-4 cups) and this particular model does not accomodate for this.Other than that it has functioned well with maintenance and I feel I've got my moneys worth. Reliable, decent coffee maker for the money."
2,Not reliable,"The first one we bought stopped working after 12 months. They were excellent and sent us a new one at no cost. Now, that one is starting to fail. Oh well...at least the customer service is good."
3,Great Concept -- Flimsy Cookie Jar,"Love the idea of this ""cookie jar"" It is very educational -- I am not sure if they have recently lowered their standards for the durability of the cookie jar, however, I just received mine in the mail today, The Jar is very flimsy, and does not hold its shape well, this causes the lid to not properly close and falls off a lot. The cookies are very well designed."
1,Very cheaply made,"My son is two years old and can already count to 10, but I thought he would have fun putting cookies in the jar and having it make noise. This toy makes no noise at all, its simply a cheap plastic jar and ten cheap plastic cookies. The cookies are so flimsy that you can bend them in half. For nearly $20 I feel this toy is a rip off. Save yourself the $20 and draw your child out 10 ""cookies"" made out of paper and turn a coffee can into a ""cookie jar""- it will have just as much educational value and will likely last as long."
3,Cookies have to go in just right,"I have the red cookie jar version (w/chocolate chips not M&M's on the cookies)... the lid fits fine. My only compliant is that the cookies always have to face the front to fit in the slot. Took some time to figure it out, but my 20 month old does get them in. (mostly just annoying) The counting voice can be kind of annoying as well, but that's expected. ;) Overall good buy."
4,these counting cookies are great,"all of these learning resources cookie games are really great products , the children fing them fun and they are durable! they are fun and they will last through many more children and grandchildren"
5,Education and Fun!,I absolutely love all of the Learning Resources Products! These Counting Cookies are both education and fun to play with!
5,my son loves it,my son loves this toy. he is 19 months old and loves putting the cookies in and out of the cookie jar. he also loves to look on the bottom of the cookie as he pulls them out and puts them back in. I say the number on the bottom as he looks at it and he tries to say the number too. I love this toy. Think it will be a wonderful help in teaching him his numbers.
1,"Poor quality, cheap plastic, toxic feeling...",This toy is horribly made! This is something you would expect to see in a dollar store. It feels very cheap. Even the packaging made me cringe. I am sending it back immediately. Go for Fisher-Price instead if you are looking for this type of toy.
2,Wouldn't buy again,"Not at all what I was expecting. It is very cheaply made and very small. I bought it to use as a cookie jar in my daughter's play kitchen as well. The picture shown isn't what I got. Her's says, ""Counting Cookies"" and I wouldn't have bought it if I had known that. The benefit is that it does have the m&ms on each cookie that correspond with the number on the other side of the cookie. Definitely not worth the money."
5,Counting cookies,What child can't associate with a cookie? These are so clever. You can use them in different ways. The number is on the bottom of the cookie. There are colored candies on the cookie in the number that is written on the bottom of the cookie. Or just have the children count as they take a cookie out and put them back in the jar. The colored candies are great for learning colors too.
5,Great way to budget your household expenses,I have been using this workbook for 5 months and I love it. It helps me get a good view to where our household funds are going. I highly recommend it.
3,Helpful,"I am currently wrestling with an ailing and unwieldy budget, and this book is really helping me to make sense out of it."
5,EXCELLENT QUALITY!,"Parrish Magic Line Square Pans, I Bake with these Pans all the time I have many of them all shapes and sizes they are Professional Quality Heavy Gauge Aluminum which translates in Excellent Heat conduction I like my Cakes to be light in Color and texture and I get that from these Pans. When I use a darker Color Baking Pan, the Cakes get too dark forming a crust and the outsisde becomes too dry, I don't like that, I like my Cakes to be Tender all the way throughI always butter and flour the Baking Pans and use a Parchment Paper Square that I cut myself, is the way to go to insure the Cakes will release without any problems, easy to wash and I do it by hand maybe that's why they still look like New even though I had them for years and I make many Cakes all the time. I think they are the Best Baking Pans! Made in the USA ...Please Check Pictures Posted of my Collection of Pans and Making Cakes, Thank You"
3,"Solid, but a letdown","I agree with Chris Green: this is good, but not their best. Just ""digestible"" is about right: more pop flavor, please. Miles is in good form and the hooks are often there, but it's only pedestrian at times.BTW, the comparisons to Wilco's YHF are odious."
5,"""These things don't last forever."" - Miles Kurosky","""Yoko"" by Beulah is an album you can not put down. It was given to me by a friend with an endearing message, ""This is my favorite band and whenever I am sad or lost in life, I listen to Beulah to find my happiness"". Happiness is exactly what I find when listening to tracks like ""Landslide Baby"", ""Don't Forget To Breathe"", and ""Me and Jesus Don't Talk Anymore"". Every song on this album is so unique and refreshing. I listen to this album from start to finish, every song is excellent, no need to skip any tracks.These are my favorites:-Landslide Baby-Me And Jesus Don't Talk Anymore-Hovering-Don't Forget to Breathe-You're Only Kind Once-A man like me"
5,Perfection,"In short, this is the best record of the year. If you're a Beulah fan, you will love it just like all the others. If you're not a Beulah fan, be prepared because I guarentee that you will be charmed and blown away. This is not just ordinary pop music. It's challenging, cathartic, and engrossing. There are surprises at every bend, both lyrically and musically, ultimately leading to a rewarding experience after each listen. Words cannot begin to explain the joy I get from this band. They are beyond amazing."
1,sent incorrect size,I ordered the 5 oz package and received 3 oz! Amazon was unable to replace. Ordered me to mail back. Not a satisfactory transaction. Hoosier Hill Farm seller is sloppy and Amazon did not offer an agreeable solution.
1,TOO SALTY,It was too salty and i didnt like the taste of it. Would not try this again its like drinkinf sea water.
2,ok,there is better one they are ok wouldnt buy them again they were less then i thought there would be small bag
2,"Fair, Not Golden","I think this is a good introduction to the gold market. It definitely exposed me to the different kinds of gold one could buy. I like Mr. Cook's views and will read more of his stuff.Having said that, this was more of an editorial on the decay of society than the importance of gold. The evils of welfare are discussed more than the subject, which irritates the reader. This was a quick read, and if you're into investing with gold, I recommend it. If one is already strong on the subject, then skip it."
3,almost perfect,"was very easy to install but not perfect fit, the stereo can not be easily removedbut satisfied with the purchasethanks from Costa Rica"
4,As expected,"This item worked as I expected. The installation was simple, quick and easy. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that the color does not perfectly match the rest of my black trim, but I sort of expected that as well. Other than that with your new radio, harness adapter (which I recommend as well) , and this install kit you should be able to save some money and do your stereo upgrade in your driveway in no time."
1,Misaligned Opening,"I bought this Metra dash kit for the installation of a Kenwood KDC-HD545U CD receiver in my 2001 Sentra. The color, texture and shape of the plastic face blended well with the rest of the Sentra's dash, but the rectangular opening was misaligned with the receiver unit by about 3mm vertically, making it impossible to mount the detachable faceplate.I suppose I could take a knife or a file and trim off 3mm of plastic from the bottom of the opening to make the faceplate fit, but why should I have to do that, especially when the Scosche installation kit that I subsequently ordered from another vendor managed to fit with the opening lining up perfectly with the receiver?"
5,Perfect,Perfect fit on my 2002 Sentra. I just wished I would have known that they also sold it in tan. I would have rather had it match my dash but the black doesn't look bad though. It fit perfectly flush and I couldn't be happier.
3,Metra 99-7414 Din Kit,"I received this item and it fit the car perfectly, with my black dashboard that is. Unfortunately, the stereo I purchased was too thick to fit in the pre-made cut out. I had to get a sander and sand it down a tad bit to make the stereo fit perfect. Looks good in the end, but nobody should have to go through that trouble. Regardless of the price. I recommend it to those who are tool savvy and would be willing to do that extra work [took about 10min] but if not, look elsewhere. Note: Installed in a 2006 Nissan Sentra w/Rockford Fosgate Stock Stereo."
5,Nissian Sentra,Looked in the stores everywhere for this. Came to Amazon and not only found what I needed but also go a discount for buying it!!! Love Amazon!!!
1,Don't buy the Kindle version!,"Don't buy the Kindle version! The publisher has not converted it to text. Rather, the pages have been scanned to a PDF document. The text cannot be increased or decreased in size. The annotations are not on the same page as the text but, rather, interspersed at random intervals. Most annotations are unreadable. It's impossible to read. Don't waste your money."
4,"Stark Tragedy, Nice Annotations","Sophocles ancient classic engrips and horrifies the reader with a tragic tale of fate and horror. Young Oedipus is destined to murder his father and marry his mother. So it is written. Eager to avoid the fickle hand of fate, his parents send young Oedipus away at early age to evade the inevitable, which of course, proves unavoidable. In addition to tragedy, this stunning classic from Ancient Greece asks that age-old question, ""who am I?"" This version provides useful annotations for readers. It gives away the ending, but how many first-timers don't already know it? We read this play freshman year in high school and struggled with certain parts, although naturally we grasped the ideas of fate, tragedy, and incest. A classic perhaps not for the faint-of-heart."
4,Surprised,After reading the back story on this play I could not put it down! I had to read for act heater Appreciation class and I am glad we did!
2,Slightly disapointed,Kind of disapoointed that I purchased this DVD since it had an Orca Whale on the cover. I was looking forward to watch the portion of the Orcas in the movie but unfortunatly I didn't see a single Orca throughout the whole movie. If your going to put an Orca on the cover at least have a portion of the movie dedicated to Orcas. Otherwise I thought the movie was very informative and well narrated :)
5,The Plague Dogs,"I have a pretty vivid imagination, so it was not hard for me to look past the dated animation and see the characters as real dogs, or feel for them in their struggles. Theis movie is meant to be more intellectual than flashy, so if you get bored easily with serious things- this is probably not the movie for you. Its also probably not the best movie for kids, despite being in cartoon format. The progression kind of drags at times; the story is pretty straight forward and linear, but nonetheless thought provoking. I think maybe i would have liked to read the book before having watched the movie."
5,Amazing,"This is a wonderful film full of emotion, suspense, crudeness, and life lessons. Past the matter of it being animated you will find this film to be a true and deep drama, a very adult movie for that matter.A film that must be seen!"
2,Loved the book...cartoon leaves much to be desired,"Cartoon departs slightly from the book, but overall remains true to the basic story line. I would definitely recommend reading the book over watching the movie...but I know most folks will just watch the movie..."
1,A disappointing version of the book.,"When I first heard of the vidio version of the terrific Plague Dogs story I couldn't wait to see it. Having recently read the book I was very disappointed by the drastic changes made in the vidio. Snitter and Rowf are cartoonish shells of the serious characters they were in the book. The 'plague' is just a ploy used by the Institute to prevent people from having sympathy for the escapees, a point lost in the movie. The ending is particularly distressing as there is no closure leaving you with that empty cheated feeling. Better just read the book!"
3,great series. but...,"it's not available on dvd? In a few years, if I want to show my kids this documentary, I'm going to have to pull out a machine that is almost obsolete."
5,Great Video Set,"This set is a great overview of some of the most important moments in America's history over the last 100 years. Unlike other similar video series, this one seems to take a look at the larger picture of American history, focusing and piecing together many periods of time and showing how they all interconnect and lead to the next rather than going into great depth on specific events. My only disappointment was that there was not more to watch, as I would have loved to have seen more of the great video clips and images that are part of this series. Some of the video shown is amazing, and really shows the emotion of these moments and brings them more fully to life. Highly recommended, and a great learning tool for those who may initially be uninterested in history."
5,Peter Jennings at his best!,Great information that I would like to watch again and again. Peter Jennings makes history interesting.
1,One of the tape cassettes was broken,Cassette number 4 which is the one about the 60's was broken and will not play. I'm trying now to move the tape to another cassette.
1,"Very famous performance, very bad performance","This is the Aida of Callas and Del Monaco, bat no the Aida of Verdi. Only Oralia Domínguez singing in verdian form."
4,The Very Best PFM,"I only discovered PFM this year. Somehow I missed them in the 70's. This is a terrific cd. If your into ELP, Yes, Gentle Giant you will love this music. After ""Photos"" ""Chocolate Kings and World became the World are excellent. This rates with the best of ELP, Yes, GG, Genesis etc. Enjoy."
4,A progressive rock showcase with emotion and energy,"PFM is one of the most overlooked progressive rock bands of the 70's. Photos of Ghosts encommpasses everything from classical improvisation to progressive rock stylings, much of the time evident in each track. In listening to the album, influences of such bands as YES, ELP, Genesis and Pink Floyd are evident, all the while keeping with the band's own unique style. I have been searching for a copy on CD of this gem for many years, and I am very pleased to have finally found one. The album is a must have in all progressive rock collections."
5,Classic Italian Progressive,"PFM along with Banco epitomize the Italian Progressive movement of the seventies. This album as well as Jet Lag, Chocolate Kings, and Passpartu are PFM's finest works."
3,Impossible for kids to put together and take apart,These are a great idea and we were super excited to get them. The fittings are way too tight on the blocks and are even difficult for an adult to put together and take apart to build different words. My kids quickly became frustrated with this aspect and eventually they went into the closet to collect dust. They would have been PERFECT had they went together more easily like legos. We use our traditional wooden letter blocks for word building more than we ever use these. You just have to invest in a couple of sets of those whereas these come with enough duplicate letters to allow word building.
1,Save your money!,I tried this product thinking it would make my teeth nice and white. It didn't do a thing for me. Not even half a single shade lighter. This is a bogus product.
1,Bad substitution,"I have purchased the Cat Grass PLUS that comes in the container for years now and the cats LOVE it and leave my plants alone. I am no longer able to find it at the retail store and when I do its over $5. Thought I would try this version, cheaper and by the same company so what could go wrong? I am now on the 4th package (Ibought 6 of them) and I barely get a dozen blades of grass...my cat is not interested and misses her lush Cat Grass PLUS...POOR SUBSTITUTIION on my part.."
3,Punk's Funniest Band,"The Dickies were masters of hilariously revved-up covers of familiar songs and TV themes, as well as the writers of such goofy originals as ""Stuck In A Pagoda With Tricia Toyota."" Their manic cover of the theme song to the '60s cartoon ""Gigantor"" (""He's bigger than big! Stronger than strong!"") was a kitsch classic. It's too bad the ""Great Dictations"" album is no longer available, since that greatest hits album was the best representation of their work. However, ""Stukas Over Disneyland"" fills the bill pretty well."
5,A voice for the future.,"Nina Cassian's poetry is some of the most extraordinary toemerge from Eastern Europe in many years, and Americanreaders can thank editor and translator William Jay forputting together this collection of samples of Cassian'sbest work, including some translations by the authorherself. A resident of the United States since 1985, havingbeen exiled from her own country, Nina Cassian is a poetwho is both academic and accessible. Her fluid, easilygrasped metaphors and poetic leaps have a charm which setsher apart from her more obscure, less emotionalcontemporaries."
3,Just Didn't Ring Any Bells,"To be clear, I don't disagree with any of the other reviewers. This is a good band. Musically solid. High energy.... but for me, nothing really caught hold. Some OK songs, but nothing special. A bit disappointed. It seems like timba bands emphasize high energy and hot rhythms instead of - in lieu of - well-crafted melodies. Many of the songs, their melodies, just kind of drift with no particular point or interesting theme. The end result is something dance-able, but not something I'm going to be humming the next day."
3,portable vise,"This vise is heavy but not well made titening nuts comes loose often haveing to stop and retiten even taking the vise apart to repair, if you have only light work this will work fine."
5,great thing,"I ordered a sea scooter by Seavenger, Corp. Order was sent the next day and got it a week later, that very quickly for Russia. Sea scooter arrived in excellent condition and fully conform to specifications given in the description. Variance voltage(we have 220V, not 110V) eliminated simple: buy a new charger.I am completely satisfied my purchase."
1,Nothing you can't find on the internet.,Don't bother with this book. The information is no better than what you can find on the internet. Offers about as much info as a cheap travel brochure.
3,cheapplastic insert,Be sure to look carefully at the picture. The black plastic grid does not fill the tray completely. It doesn't come up to the top and isn't flush with the sides. It's only about half the depth of the tray. Also ours has over 1/4 inch of play on each side so it moves around rather than fitting inside the tray. The brass part seems well made. The plastic insert is super cheap. Not fit for commercial use.
5,Upholstery nails,"I bought these, not for upholstery, but to secure my magic mesh door panels. They work better that the pins they came with at a very reasonable price."
4,Better than expected,"I am writing in regards to the Wool Sportcoat I purchased in November. When the sportcoat arrived, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of this sportcoat. For the price, I expected somewhat of a lower grade, but was very happy with this product.Thank you for the prompt shipment."
5,Dirk Powell is in a class by himself.,This music will touch your soul. The music he plays really takes you to another place in time and the little clips of his Grandfather are very heartwarming. Dirk powell is my most favorite bluegrass performer. From the first song to the last if you love the clawhammer banjo and a smoking fiddle I guarantee that you will love this music. I've been listening to it for three years and I never get tired of it.
5,One of Binchy's Best!,"Although I have read seven of Maeve Bincy's books, this one is my favorite. The Glass Lake is full of suprises and you can't help but love the characters. I am still waiting for another book of Binchy's to be made into a movie and I'm hoping this one will be next. Even though the book is always better than the movie, it would be interesting to see how the characters would be portrayed. This is an excellent book and the best one I have read yet!"
2,An Airplane Read written by the Queen of Run-on Sentences,"I read Binchy's Light a Penny Candle years ago, and liked it, but have never been able to get ""into"" another Binchy book. Saw this at an airport bookstore and, as I had a long flight ahead of me, bought it. It was okay... not the worst book I've ever read, but not the best either. What really drove me to distraction, though, were the numerous run-on sentences on every page!! Either Binchy never learned good grammar in school, or her copy editor didn't. It also seems unbelievable to me that Lena would give it all up for that loser Louis. You could see what was coming a mile away."
3,irish is as irish does,"the best thing about this book is the dialog, in which you can really hear the irish accent. the story hook, the disappearance of the mother, is very clever, and some of the characters are also fine, kit mac mahon and her mother in particular, but i felt the plot got away from her; MB has a tendency to pack her stories with characters and some of them always get lost, and this happened here. and her fixation on ""smart""--meaning trendy and fashionable, not intelligent--got to me. but i was in ireland last summer and all through the book i kept hearing those lilting, lovely voices."
3,Not Bad...,"I enjoyed this book from the start and found the storyline engrossing but not particularly believable. Maeve Binchy's books always seem to be able to draw the reader into the story and I have enjoyed all the ones I have read so far but I found myself skipping some pages of The Glass Lake as I found some parts of the storyline a bit irrelevent and uninteresting. I also thought that the ending was a bit rushed in comparison to the rest of the book and I would liked there to have been a more about some of the smaller characters in the book, such as Sister Madelaine.I would recommend reading this book however, as I did find it compelling and hard to put down."
4,Maeve creates mystery,"Like her other novels, this one has plenty of great character studies. The twist is the mystery created in the main character, and her unusual choices that impact so many. Lots to keep you turning pages and enjoying the story."
5,Maeve Binchy does it again,"I have been a Maeve Binchy fan for years ,and this one is as expected ,difficult to put down ,It was with saddness to be finished .,knowing that we would not be hearing from MAEVE again, as she has just passed away RIP .This story is so good ,funny but sad at times,wonderfully written. Maeve was a great story teller and will be sadly missed"
5,FUN!,"The Glass lake, like other Binchy novels, is equallyengrossing and lively. This time the strange circumstancesinvolving a young girl and her family will not allow you toput the book down. It is an easy and fast read despite thelength. The characters, as always, are amusing andstrangely reminiscent of someone you know. Do not miss thisone if you are a Binchy fan."
2,Too Long - But good Story,"Good story line but sooooo long. Took me a while to finish. The author could have cut about 100 pages out and it would have been a more interesting read. There's sadness, happiness, deceit and love."
3,Most wrenching scene if you like to feel deeply,"One pivotal scene between main characters is one of, if not the most shockingly emotional that I have read. I felt as though I was punched in the stomach when i read it, started to cry and felt all the pain the female was feeling. So in that Binchy excelled. I think Binchy used this book to explore moral dilemmas and present characters that were all flawed in some way. Not one is truly likeable except perhaps the housekeeper of the main family. The various plot points come together in a melodramatic and pat way. A character dying is the easy way out for an author. Then, other plot lines seem to go no where. I remember enjoying some of her earlier books but I can't really recommend this one."
3,Hmm,"Good book, great characters, not enough resolution. This frayed-cord of an ending was inexcusable after teasing us readers through this long long LONG book. What was the point? After spending so much time with the characters, I felt no sympathy for them after all was said and done. It's terrible the way the last stinky hundred pages of a book can over-shadow the first good six hundred."
2,Panifully slow and long,"I stuck with this book because I wanted to see why Maeve Binchy seems so popular. I still don't get it.How many times did we need to hear that Helen married a man she really didn't love, or that Philip was in love with Kit but she did not return his feelings?Kit fell in love with Stevie, but I just don't believe that she would have still cared for him when she found that he had beat Louis so badly that he lost teeth. That would not be the kind of person Kit would care for.Parts of the story were pretty good, like when Kit threw away the letter, but overall I found it terribly slow with lots of uninteresting reading."
5,The Glass Lake,The Glass Lake is classic Binchy with all the characters and their different stories that combine to create a great read. These characters in particular are extremely interesting and make it very difficult to put the book down. Do yourself a favour and get this one.
4,Love Maeve Binchy's books,Enjoyble readying. I can always count on an interesting read that will hold my interest and leave me feeling good.
2,Depressing,"As a mother I read this book and could not get over how depressing it was starting out. Yes, it got better, but still! What kind of person chooses ""Silly Romantic"" love over her own children! The author tried to make it all work out in the end, but look at all the sorrow every character had to endure, as well as the reader!I love and recommend Mrs. Binchy's other books, but not this one."
4,the glass lake,"good cover, no worn pages i would definately recommend this service as I have had consisdent good products sent to me"
3,Very disappointed with the ending.,"I loved the characters in ""The Glass Lake"". The story was very captivating and held my interest and I couldn't wait to finish it to see how everything comes together. Well, guess what? There was no conclusion to the story."
2,"Choppy writing style, corn-ball characters","I must've been really young when I read ""Circle of Friends"", or I just can't tolerate this kind of writing anymore. Maeve Binchy does a decent job of describing people and their surroundings, but as soon as dialogue appears, and we enter the characters minds, I couldn't help thinking ""People just DON'T talk and act this!"" A little too un-believable, especially considering the seriousness of the main character's dilemma. Typical of 'romance novel' writing styles."
4,Maeve Binchy is one of my favorite writers,The storyline kept you guessing right through to the end. A good read that keeps you interested. A typical Maeve Binchy book.
4,Great book!,"This is the second Binchy novel I have read and I loved it!My only complaint about Glass Lake is the rushed end. I think Binchy took the easy way out for the ending, I turned the last page expecting more and found that it had ended.However, despite the ending I really did enjoy the book. I have found myself thinking about the characters and what could have happened. And I finished the book three days ago! The characters are very realistic and I really felt connected to them. All Binchy fans should give it a try."
5,best ever Everly's compendium available,"This long-postponed and finally newly-reissued greatest hits disc by one on the truly pioneering acts of rock is another godsend from DCC Compact Classics. All the clasics are here--""When Will I Be Loved"", ""Bird Dog"", ""Wake Up Little Suzie"", et.al.---In best-ever sound. A perfect compliment to the Rhino ""Cadence Classics"" compilation, which it nearly duplicates in track selection, sacrificing two songs from that set but making up for it by including the immortal ""Cathy's Clown"", recorded later for Warner Brothers. Get both CDs and don't miss out."
4,Russian vocabulary,"NTC's Dictionary of Russian Cognates Thematically Organized (2000), the most recent cognate compendium by Rose Nash, is at once the most complete and most useful work in its field.Advertised as a vocabulary builder, the book has special relevance for English-Russian translators. The number of cognates is extraordinary 264 double-columed pages and the organization by themes is very easy to follow through an alphabetical listing of topics. Entries are alphabetically listed, in English, under subtopics, so items can be found quickly.Nash's Introduction is excellent. The student-oriented orthographic and phonologic description of the Cyrillic alphabet is lucid and thorough. The sections on the nature of cognates and their use in translation are applicable to any language context.The book is available only in paerback. This keeps the cost down but magnifies wear and tear on books subject to a lot of handling.Dr. Eugene V. Mohr"
2,16 bit Christmas Music,"The songs on this CD are okay, but they are all 16 bit synthesized music, sounding very similar to the music you would hear in a Nintendo 64 game. That said, some of the songs are still pretty good and acceptable background music. If you're looking for truly instrumental Christmas CD, try to find something that is ACTUALLY orchestrated."
4,Fiery love and passion in an unlikely place,"Instant enemies become passionate friends in the space of a few days. But, they each are hiding something that may ruin their chances of future happiness. Maura Seger outdoes herself again in this touching and sometimes funny romance!"
2,just the basics,I bought the leash for my 8 pound dog to replace a similar item. This leash is very compact and cheaply made. The button to hold the leash at a shorter length is difficult to get into place and frequently pops out of position. Choose a different brand & you'll be happier.
2,Does not last,"I've owned two of these and used them on two house cats. Both units broke in the same way. The return spring breaks after a while (3-6 months) and the cord no longer retracts. Although they were under warranty, cost and hassle of returning them to Flexi for replacement seemed not worth the effort. I have replaced them with another brand."
4,"Works well, but not as pictured","This retractable leash arrived in a cotton candy pink--not the hot pink as pictured. Works fine, no problems with retracting, sturdy enough for $20, and I would recommend as long as you're okay with the baby color."
3,shortened and took forever to get,"It took very close to 2 weeks to get the book apparently because it was coming from across the pond. could not track the item which sucked. then i got the book and my first assignment was to read one of the first 4 chapters, can't remember what one, but guess what it wasn't even in there and all it had was a short little paragraph about what happened in it."
5,Shady Record Does it Again!!!!!!!! Pure Genius!!!!!!!,"This CD is Pure Genius. Eminem, D12, and G-Unit all do awesome on this CD. Don't forget the star of the CD Obie Trice!!!! This guy Rocks!!!!! He is going to be the new 50 Cent!!!! This is actually a little better than Get Rich or Die Tryin'!!!! This CD is F@##$n' Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Best Songs:Lady (Eminem)We all Die One DayGot Some Teeth"
2,Good for a couple listens,"I bought this CD with high expectations, and after about a week of listening to it, I was disappointed. None of these songs are catchy, and quickly get more irritating with each listening. The only track I will ever consider listening to this album would be 'Don't Come Down' which is just an average song anyways.Only get this if you are a hardcore Shady/Aftermath fan, not if you're looking for something with replay value."
4,Four Cheers for Obie,"This album is slamming. With album producers like Eminem, Dr. Dre & Timbaland this 17 track album is a hot cake in the market.Tracks like ""Lady"", ""Got Some Teeth"", S**t hits the fan"", this album is a delight for everyone both Eminem fans and none Eminem fans. Obie Trice has certainly come to stay. Keep it up Obie."
4,what a debut,"This album didnt get enough hype or publicity, it's a great f**ckin album and is underated. Eminem does a more than a comendable production job and along with Dre an Timbaland also on production makes for some o the best beats ive heard in a long time. Obie's style of rapping isn't the greatest and he still has alot to prove lyrically but so did Dre when he first started out. If you liked The Eminem Show you'll cream yourself over this. Trust me!"
1,Topological Mayhem in the Baronetcy,"How many times have you wondered whether European snobbery and social constraint might possibly introduce a note of religious devotion into the post-Reformation ideal of romantic love? Ponder no longer, my fellow gerundists, for with this single reticulatory concept album, ballgag-master Obie Trice (perhaps better known by his original name of Celiba Te Faggi) has entered the arena ready for contact, making it at last possible to assess young Master Faggi's legacy in the realm of recreational projectiles. And until last year, according a report by the GAO, the Air Force Reserves were still using a recruiting form that asked applicants, ""Are you homosexual or bisexual?"" and ""Do you intend to engage in homosexual acts?""--clear violatons of the don't-ask provision. For this egregious provocation, we have badass OT to thank. Lotsa luck, guys!"
2,Not worth purchasing,"I had really high expectations for Obie's album. Maybe too high. Everybody keeps comparing this to 50 Cent's album, a gangsta album whatever...this album actually has a lot better lyrical content than GRODT...I'm not sure whether it's because 50 dumbed down his lyrics on that album but Obie appears to have much more lyrical skill. And that's not saying much since he barely ever drops a hot line in the entire album.Production wise, it starts off very promising. When I first heard the album, I listened to it a lot...maybe too much. The beats get old very very very quickly, and the same goes for the entire album as a whole.If you are a Shady/Aftermath groupie and you'll buy anything with eminem's name on it, I suggest you borrow it and see if you change your opinion. Otherwise, don't waste your time buying this."
2,"got some brains, plus ryhme skills","got some teeth is something will smith would have did back in 88 this is'nt the best cd this year but one of the worst cd's I've heard the industry just keeps putting out sorry cd's who people go and buy m,ainly because of the half naked girls in videos.best thing obie has going for him is eminem, and dre who can basically make anybody a star ask 50, gunit, and d12 who nobody's feeling no more."
3,Good,"Unfortunately, working with Mr Shady, the expectations rise about ten fold. I bought this album on the back of the single 'Got Some Teeth', which I wouldn't normally do, but the track reeked of Eminem and I love his music. Unfortunately, the album didn't live up to the first singles promises, and I guess this is why so many people wrote it off as another flop from a Shady wannabee. I certainly wrote it off originally. But on the second and third listen, it certainly grew on me, and I developed respect for Obie. He didn't follow so closely to Em's footsteps that he forgot he could make his own, he went his own way and made a solid rap album. Don't judge this before you hear it, and don't judge it by his various executive producers that are featured. It's pure Obie and you have to respect him for that."
4,"Real Name, No Gimmicks","Obie Trice's debut CD, ''Cheers'' is a solid CD. Although I must say, the best song's to me include other artists. Eminem appears in four songs on the album, and coincidentally, their my four favorite songs. ''Got Some Teeth'' is a hillarious song, and ''We All Die Someday'' featuring Lloyd Banks, Eminem, 50 Cent, and DJ Whookid, is probably my favorite rap song of all time. I recommend you buy this album cause you'll be hooked immidiately."
1,Garbage,This cd is one of the worst cd's. Even though i hate that east coast style this cd is horrible. Save your money and get any other cd. I recommend that chingy cd or that murphy's law.
3,OBieVille,"Obie's first round is not so bad, I've heard better from him, but this is pretty good. He has a lot of good tracks on there. I'm just glad that I didn't have to skip over a bunch of tracks."
1,you people are sheep,"First off, I am in the music industry, and am affiliated with people in this clique. I will remain anonymous to express my true thoughts. Some of the beats on this album are pretty ill, but Obie is a pretty half ass lyricist. In fact all of G Unit are pretty wack as far as writing good verses. The songs pump you up, and the beats are phat, but if we are talking about skill as an emcee, neither obie, or anybody in g unit (except maybe banks) has got skill. They all are half ass. You people probably havent been listening to rap for too long. Also Eminem comes up with some ok beats, but i'd say about one for every ten he makes is actually decent. The rest are boring and wack with no substance. Also siince you dont know Dr. Dre does not make beats. He has a team that does it for him, and then he picks em out and takes the credit."
2,this album is pretty lame,"ok, the beats on almost every song are DOPE, which is why i gave it 2 stars. it's obvious that dre and everyone involved really wanted to help out obie by working hard on the beats and the cameo appearances... but for real, his lyrics are STUPID. they don't make sense. just listen to ANY of his songs and try to make sense of anything he says. he switches subjects every 3 words, and his money lines just aren't money. he doesn't even rhyme that well. if u want to buy something worth it, check out the new G Unit cd or search on google for West Buurbs (they haven't released a cd yet) the beats and eminem's verses are good, REAL good, but besides that, trash this trash."
4,"Obie Trice, Real Name, No Gimmicks","Just to put it simple, obie has dropped it down on his latest cd. Most of the songs are tight, so you won't be dissapointed hooking up this one. I don't understand why anyone would wanna throw the diss down knowing em and dre took part in this album. Anything these guys put out will be good, you can guarantee it. I recommend with the other reviewers about the tightest songs on the track: Lady, Outro (Nice), and I also liked the set up with my man Nate Dogg. Either way, check it out, you won't be disappointed."
3,"Production's good, but Trice is just okay.","Unless your name is Eminem, anybody on Shady Records who releases after Get Rich or Die Tryin'has an unenviable task of trying to top 50's blockbuster. Obie tries, but it just was never gonna happen. It isn't enough of the flava that you got on the shady mix tapes. Too many guest appearances, not enough Obie. Here's looking forward to when he REALLY blows up."
4,Kangaroo should hang with Stupazino and the sauce.,Anyway the album is good for your first and he is no gimmick for nothing by the way. EM and busta did a nice job on this album
3,Don't jump on the bandwagon...,"Of course people are gonna say ""THIS IS STRAIGHT FIRE!!!"" because there are A LOT of eminem d*ck ryders (that feel ANYTHING he does is genius)All I gotta say is remember 50 cent. 50 was straight hype when his CD droped - It wasn't until about a month or so people started to realise the album was just ""aight"".So it's probably best to ignore the hype, and check out the best tracks on the CD:Songs to check out:1. Sh*t hits the fan2. Average Man3. Lady4. We All Die One DayThat's pretty much all that's good on this album. Most of production is wack. Obies flow in most songs is horrible. Nothing new lyrically.Nothing new brought to the rap game... just another album that is FAR from perfect."
4,nice,"Of course, Obie Trice is no Eminem. But then again, who is? The only lyrical comparison I can draw to Eminem is the late GREAT Tupac Shakur (I consider Tupac the greatest of all time, but from a lyrical standpoint Eminem is definitely a close second, and yes, Nas is up there too...let us not forget ""Illmatic""). With that said, Obie's debut is a solid effort. While I can't say it's one of the best rap albums out there, I also can't help but find myself listening to it all the time. There is something about this album that is very catchy. My ""hands"" down favorite track is ""Hands On You"" featuring Eminem. However, Em only does the hook, so the song is by no means dominated by him, and Obie's talent is clearly put on display. Overall, this album is definitely worth the money, I mean it's a Shady Records Production, of course it's great."
5,Shady records you better believe the hype is reel!!!!!!!!!!!,"Obie is one of the best newcomers of 2003. He gets to the point on his albums and everything he says is reel, and he keeps s&%@ honest. I think he will destroy sucka mcs like t.i. Lil john chingy, and dat lil B**** lil kim"
1,"Che Piangere, Luigi?","Look, I'm as glad as the next rap fan to learn that young OT has recovered from all those years of abuse at the hands of his mentor Michael ""Freakqueen"" Jackson. And I'm glad he's getting back in the saddle after his traumatic experiences and all that. But do we really need to hear this stuff? Maybe it's good therapy for him, but good God does it grow monotonous very quickly. If I hear one more time about OT's love for his fellow man (yeah, we get it, OT), or if I have to see his epicene figure writhing on stage in shocking re-enactment of his ""initiation"" into the lifestyle, I swear I'm gonna scream. Come back when you've mastered the verismo style, Obie Wan. Then we'll give you a listen."
3,average =/,"i was thinking of buying dis album. but since my friend had it on his computer. i decided to download it and hear it to see how it is. and ITS JUST AVERAGE! nuthing special. typical album i hear these days. nuthing different.but the thing dat stands out about dis album is the beats.timbaland laced a masterpiece beat in dis album. amazing.dre and eminem held their own as well.but wut im feeling about dis album is the songs where Obie Trice talks about his life. and the funny tracks like ""hoodrats"" etc.I'm glad I didnt purchase dis album, but it was worth the time burning it."
2,U got somethin else to say besides kangaroo punk,Arite u reply wit one sentence and u can't even write that properly i.e. u you. What u on? A lack of brains cells probably and dont tell me u smoke green cause then u would surely be able to come up with more creative replies. Anyway this albulms wack except track 1+2. Masta Killa's albulms dropping soon should be phat.
5,Shady did It again with another great CD,"Got Some Theeth is one of his cool songs.This will be a CD I will buy.Eminem,50 Cent,G-Unit,Obie Trice they are the best.Shady Records/Interscope have very good CD's"
1,what the?,"I glad I didn't buy this cd. I burned it from a friend who loaned it to me and the whole cd sucked. I thought eminem had better taste, guess not, he might as well make up with Vanilla ice and put him on his label. When I wanted to give it back to my friend he told me to keep it, he didn't even want it back. Don't waste you money."
2,obie's watches from the background,"this album was not worth buying because obie didnt come off clever and creative with catchy themes. Eminem stills the spot light on ""Lady"" and has most listeners fastforwarding to 1:20 to when Em comes in. The spot light never gets back to being on Obie instead Busta Rhymes steals the spot light on the track he's on towards the end of the CD. Great beats and verses by EM busta nate dogg and 50. Obie just couldn't compare."
4,Not bad...Not superb,"This album is MUCH better then the album from 50 cent with Shady Records ""Get Rich or die tryin'"". The fact is...that Obie Trice's able to speak : ) As an overall look I would say that music & rhymes are a lot better than 50 cent's..."
5,Remarkable,"This album is ridiculous. This album is on point in every aspect. The beats are sick, the rhymes are nice and ""Lady"" has to be the best hip hop collaborations in a long time with Obie and Em. Out of 17 tracks you will skip through maybe 3 tracks. Hip hop fans need to pick this album up. I don't give away 5 stars just like that and if the Source would rate this it would have to be a 4 1/2. But they are hating right now. I'm not all on the Shady bandwagon, I like hip hop whether it be Def Jam or Underground or whatever. This is Hip Hop and you can tell alot of focus went into this album. He came correct on his first joint. Different topics, sh*t talking, lyrical battles, commercial hits it has it all. Go pick this up!!"
3,Cheers,"I have always been interested to see what Shady Records can come up with next! This not a bad album its better than I thought that it would be, there are many appearances from Eminem, 50 cent. G unit and Dr DRE Obviously but also appearances from Busta Rhymes and Nate Dogg. There are a number of different styles in this album with tracks that are serious and some with Humor in them, I think the highlights of this album are ""Got some teeth"" and ""S*** Hits the fan"" which features Dr Dre and Eminem and is directed at Ja Rule.Overall I would say that most tracks are great but as with all albums there is the occasional track that could be better"
4,Plesently Surprised...,"Wow i was really surprised. Obie Trice i always thought was an average rapper but he blew me away with ""Cheers.""Eminem really knows the beats to use with a MC like Obie. The guest appearences really helped this album but sometimes they were unneeded. Like Eminem didn't have to be on ""Hands on You"" to make that a good track but in saying that he didn't nothing to hurt the song."
4,4 Stars Very Good Album,"Obie Trice really stun me with this album. It was acually good. He was spittin on this album with fire. The production was decent but it matched his flow and style. It was shockingly cohesive. I expected another D12 album but this was really good. Should had sold better. Hopefully his next album would be just as good.Top 3 Songs: Ooh, The Set-Up, Average ManBottom 3 Songs: Got Some Teeth, Follow My Life, Look in my EyesSleppers: Neva Forget Ya, Hands on You"
1,Obie doesn't live up to hype,"Obie is a mediocre lyricist, with a below average flow and delivery. The best joints on this album have NOTHING to do with him, but rather the guest appearing on the album. First mistake they made was making and releasing ""Got some teeth"". The song alianted his current fans. People saw right through the attempt to gain the TRL crowd and the single bombed. Despite MARKETING this album so strong they had NO buzz. So they then threw in a ""Golden Ticket"" to boost the sales and stop the album from FLOPING. But the winning ticket is to meet EMINEM not OBIE TRICE? The album has average to below average beats and brings nothing to the table as far as lyrical content. Which a rapper with personality and charisma could get by with. But Obie lacks both."
1,HOEBIE RICE,CRAP JUST PURE CRAP ON A DISC.....What iz wrong with you people in thiz world today wit thiz whack rap muzik yall listen 2
1,"Get some Teeth, Get your own Teeth.","This isn't hardcore, this is another pathetic excuse of commerical nonsense, the infamous shad/aftermath has tooffer, the guy can't rap, the songs are annoyingand the beats are worthlessthis guy is a rip-off of crooked i, and I Can't untilthis shady/aftermath era is overThis is garbage"
2,CHEERS.. I PERSONALLY THINK THAT THIS ALBUM IS WEAK,"I THINK THIS ALBUM IS WEAK. I DONT NOW WHY EVERYONE IS GIVING IT 5 STARS.THE ONLY REASON I'M GIVING IT 2 STARS IS BECAUSE OF THE GUEST APPEARANCES.I THINK THAT OBIE TRICE IS FAKE..AND JA AND THE INC ARE MUCH BETTER THEN HIM..HE AINT NOWHERE NEAR EMINEM,DRE,5O OR G UNIT.SO IF U WANT A GOOD ALBUM GET KANYE WEST NEW ALBUM OR JA RULES NEW ALBUM.DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS"
2,CHEERS MY AZZ....THIS IS WACK!!!!!!!...ONLY LIKED ONE SONG!!!!!!!!,"I GUESS THIS IS OBIE TRICE!!!!!!....I ASK MY SELF,WHAT ELES DOES HE HAS ACORDING TO THIS RAP GAME?"
1,Too bad for Em...,"I am a huge fan of Eminem, and of his Shady Records Label too. And after he released 50 Cent's album Get Rich or Die Tryin', I was sure that Eminem was headed for production greatness. Unfortunately, I was let down with Obie Trice. I am sorry, this man cannot rap and should not rap! It is obvious that he is trying to be the next Big Boi or Andre 3000. It ain't gonna happen, Obie! You can't rap! And to make things a little worse, he is trying to be a hip-hop artist! Man, you gotta have the vocals like Outkast or Nelly. Obie would be better suited as a metal artist! Please, give me a break on this one! The only thing you'll be saying Cheers to is when this piece of garbage ends up in the city dump. Better luck next time, Em!"
2,Overshadowed,"Obie Trice is not very impressive whatsoever on this album, his rap style is off, and Eminem will join him in a song and blow him away with his flow and lyrics..... Obie Trice would have NEVER EVER EVER sold one-tenth as many albums if Eminem weren't on any of the tracks, and i guarantee you that he NEVER will sell very many again if he doesn't get Eminem to cameo in some of his songs, nobody cares about Obie Trice, Eminem created him, and he sure as hell is no 50 Cent, this was an Eminem failure trying to make Obie like 50 Cent"
4,Good for getting the necessary dosages!,"Firstly, this book does not have 840 pages and hardcover. It has aproximately 340 pages and softcover. Even so, I think it is a good book to consult the dosages in general that are used for small, large and exotic animals. Besides, it has others useful topics.I have compared the dosages with others formularies and fortunately, these are the same or similar. And finally, because this book is small, you can take it with you to your vet's consults."
4,for professionals,"good overview. however, you may still need peer supervision in order to practice this as a healthcare professional. informative, would buy again"
4,John Frankovic - 'Space Zombie' (Brainticket Records),"Former vocalist / frontman of '80's band Plasticland,assumingly his first solo effort. Very good psychedelic CD release. Songs are well written and played. Tracks I found myself playing many times are ""Here We Stand"" (good sitar), the solid psych rocker ""My Room,Your Room"", ""Go To Sleep"" (love that organ playing), ""You're Telling Me"" (reminds me of Asteroid #4), the total tripping ""Vulcan"" and ""Phalisti Revisited"". Line-up: John Frankovic-synthesizer, sitar& vocals, Voot Warnings-guitar, Dave Junkers-guitar&bass, Bobbio-organ and Ralph Drizwick-percussion. Should appeal to fans of Nick Riff, Hawkwind, Krel, Lockgroove, Spacehead and Asteriod #4. Recommended."
1,Not even worthy of one star !!!,"Quotes from TV, Hollywood, Popular music and such...What [garbage]!! Shameful self promotion on the introductory page..how a seminary president was Sooo impressed with his illustrations...that these illustration would PREACH..ha! Not at all in line any form of biblical preaching.Just horrible!! I may have used one of his illustrations but the rest of the pages would best be used for a bird cage."
4,Rozenblit Book informative but not authoritative,"This book is concise and contains much useful information but is not adequate in and of itself to understand how to effectively design tube audio gear.Bruce goes into some detail regarding feedback and stability but without previous experience the reader will be somewhat at a loss to get results.It also does not explain the whys and wherefores of ""modern"" tube audio practice as they differ from traditional goals and methodologies.I do recommend this book,but must caution the reader against expecting too much from it.The Germans (Reiner zur Linde) and Japanese (Asano,Shishido et al)ar far ahead of anything published in English to date and until the US press ""catches up"" or someone translates these works,I think the would-be tube designer would do well to concentrate on literature from the mainstream tube period."
3,A lot of opinion but some good information,"This short book covers construction of tube audio equipment for beginners. I like to build tube audio-it's definitely more homebrew friendly than solid state and often sounds better-but I think one should have a better electronics background before starting these projects than Rozenblit presupposes. I think absolute beginners should start with the bookwork first and then build simple projects such as regenerative receivers with FET's before moving to tubes and then line powered audio gear.This is a reasonably good but not really comprehensive book, best picked up after you can solder, use test equipment-you cannot build or troubleshoot without a generator and some kind of oscilloscope as well as an AC voltmeter accurate to .1 dB from 20 Hz to at least 30 or 40 kHz, and people who tell you otherwise are misguided or lying-and follow schematics pretty well."
3,"A great start, and then...","You would think that a worldbeat album whose instrumental components include didgeridoo, dumbek, keyboards, guitar, tablas, sarangi, bass, and vocals would be substantial, and in many cases you'd be right. Not this one, though. The first three tracks are great--flavorful worldbeat that does what you'd think it should.But after that, the album gets weaker by the track. Shmaltz replaces invention, and by the last tune, I had heard more than enough. This is really a shame, because the potential is definitely there for these guys to be substantially better than they reveal on most of this album. For 15 1/2 minutes, they cook. Then the fire goes out and they just kinda sit there.Your call."
1,Compared to what?,"Even if this were the only video of soccer moves I'd say avoid it. Fortunately, there are better tapes so I'd pass on this whole series unless you can get it at the library and even then prepare to use the fast fwd button a LOT. This has to be the weakest tape of the 6 tape series since there is no motivation or logic given behind anything shown - just 'do this..like this.."" and there are few if any close-ups of the foot in motion.Here's a simple hint for anyone whose kicks are too low, bouncing along the grass and losing momentum. If your supporting foot is slightly behind the ball, the kicking foot will catch the ball on the upward part of its arc and give a little loft to the ball. I have never seen this explained in any video tape - someone at work pointed it out to me. All the boys on my U-10 team can now kick nice shots and understand this simple logic."
3,Do you know how to kick a soccer ball?,This tape expalins how to properly kick a soccer ball. The key here is the control. There are drills for building the feel for the correct contact with the ball. The tape is not as good as the dribbling tape but you need to know how to kick the ball. I have used the knowledge from this tape to help teach kicking skills to 12 year old players.
3,A sad but wothwhile read!,This is another good book to add to your library chronicling the war in Vietnam. The more you read about this chapter in our history the more you understand the damage that occurred to the minds of the soldiers involved in that military action. The suffering does not stop when you leave the battle area and requires a great deal of support from loved ones to 'make you whole' again. We owe them!!
4,gift for a friend,This was a special gift for a friend who was unable to find this for himself. He wasvery pleased to have received a copy shortly after we discussed it
4,Don't let the nay-sayers get you down....,"This is a wonderful disk. If you've never listened to much solo PeteTownshend, this is good for you, if you've owned many of his albums for years, this is good for you. In the spirit of Psycholderelict, this is best listened to in one sitting, not to hear a story evolve this time, but to listen to the IDEAS evolve. Certainly the full LIFEHOUSE CHRONICLES would be more interesting, I look forward to getting them. And have songs from this album been available for years on other releases? Yes. But it is a splendid and worthy listen regardless. And if you are shopping for a Pete Townshend fan who DOESN'T have this - or perhaps only has White City, Chinese Eyes, and Empty Glass - you will be such a rock star if you buy this for them. Gift it and then wait a couple of days for the BIG hug."
4,People have no sense of history.,"I think half the people that reviewed this Cd are imbeciles. I truly dont believe that any of them realize the context of these songs, and that these songs were his DEMOS recorded back in 70/71 for the original Lifehouse project. Ok, I admit, the orchestral Baba Oriley is rather bad here, but, the demos are fascinating. And for the person who said that his drumming is weak, well, he definitely is'nt Keith Moon, but he tries, and he keeps a rather competent beat. No better or worse than Paul Mccartney. Without these demos, the Who's versions would never have existed. Even though its not on here, his version of BARGAin hold its own against the Who's version. The individuals who slammed this CD, should be drawn and quartered."
3,LiFeHoUsE: ElEmEnTs By Pete Townshed,"It is a good and hearty preview of the supposedly ""soon to be released"" box set. I personally rated it 3 stars. Take a chance, If you dont like it,return it..."
4,Go Figure,"Strange, Quirkey, Quasi-Inspired, Off-Center, Essentric, Chaotic, Not for the uninitiated, Un-Who-Like, Perplexing, deliberately uncommercial, Inconsistent...Yes, it does have it's moments...Yes, undeniably Pete Townsend...Undeniable Genius."
2,Skip it and splurge for the full set,"This could be of interest to anyone who has not heard the full 6 CD ""Lifehouse Chronicles"", but that set has two discs of classical pieces, two discs of radio play, and two discs of demos, including a riveting live ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" and a 12 minute mix of the ""Who Are You"" on ""Elements"" with what could be Pete's best guitar work since Leeds."
4,Ok Book,"While Perl is an important language for web programmers, I feel that it should be learned in whole and not in a small reference. The ""Visual Blueprint"" series has its purpose, however ""Perl: Your visual blueprint for building Perl scripts"" does not explain many important advanced tasks that Perl programmers often get into.I enjoy the aesthetic quality of the Maran Graphics' books, and have nothing against this book. However, serious programmers who want to learn much more of Perl and CGI should take a look at Perl How to Program by the Deitels. It is much more effective in teaching Perl theory as well as giving you a lot examples that are complex enough to use multiple ideas. The Complete Perl Training Coarse (also from the Deitels) is very effective as well.I am still a child, but I have explored many server-side programming technologies (Java Servlets, Applets, JSP, CGI, and Perl) and feel that I am expierenced enough to review this book."
2,Could have been much better,This is not a book to learn Perl from. The inherent problem with this book is the author tries to give you a practical problem and then a way in Perl to solve the problem.Compared to other instructional Perl books I found this one lacking the structure needed to learn the language.It may be just me. Maybe these visual blueprint books are not the way I learn. I just know that this one will sit on my shelf collecting dust.
2,Three songs and the remainder of the CD is a DVD?,How disapointing to see that this album was not a musical CD but an album with a very poor DVD along with three songs. Disturbed is slipping down within the ranks of being the best Metal Masters.
4,A nice variation of lift the flap books,"I just got this yesterday, so I tried it out on a couple of my summer school students and it was a hit. The flaps are in the shape of silhouetted people and animals. At the beginning of the book is the situation that there is a monster in the book but where???With the exception of one very sensitive student who didn't want to read about monsters, the others were delighted and intrigued. They were all 4 - 6 years old. I can't wait to use this book with my regular students in the fall. I will probably be buying this book for a little boy I know for Christmas. Too bad it wasn't around when my children were little...."
5,It is indeed hilarious!,"As the other reviewers have stated, I can't think of a better word than hilarious to describe this book. I haven't loved and enjoyed a book like this in a long time.The author was a guest speaker at a recent meeting of a service club I belong to. His humorous Cinderella story as a writer captured my attention so much that I hung around afterword to buy his book and have it signed. While waiting my turn, I scanned a few pages and was immedately captured by the humor. I indulged in a second copy as a birthday gift for a good friend. It's a cherished book for both of us now. I'll be purchasing another copy to loan to friends as I don't want my signed first edition to leave my possession.It's a quick read, more so because you find yourself saying ""I'm going to finish this chapter and then go fold the laundry,"" only to find that as the chapter ends you absolutely must move on to the next one to find out what happens. It's a wonderfully funny story. I highly recommend it."
4,Fast-Paced and Fun,This book is very clever and enjoyable. It never got too silly like some of Joe Keenan's novels.I would definitely recommend this for people who enjoy Carl Hiassen and Christopher Buckley's work.I'm glad to see there's a sequel!
5,Laugh-Out Loud Funny,"With all the stresses of everyday life, it was nice to lose myself in this romp of a book. Acito got to my funny bone, and I laughed my way through the end. I can't wait for another Acito book. I love his humor!"
2,Actually 2 and a a half.,I enjoyed the story and the characters. Even if some of the plot doesn't seem possible and the characters are older than their supposed 18 years. They were a hell of a lot more further along than I was at my graduation in 1983. But it is fiction. The message about friends sticking toghether is woven throughout the book and it is a great message if your afraid of sexuality in novels or not. However the ending was too simplistic. After having all these enjoyable loose ends it stinks to have the package all wrapped up in a short chapter at the end. Quick and easy to read and fun.
4,A great read for the open minded,"If you have a sense of humor and are not particularly close minded about petty crime or homosexuality you will love this book. I wish I'd known these people when I was going to HS in NJ. They are hysterical and very loyal friends. Despite some unethical moments, it is a sweet coming of age story.I read the hardcover book and found it very funny, but I am told the guy who does the audio version is very dramatic and makes the story even funnier, so you might want to get that version instead. But whatever form you get it in you should definitely get this book. Enjoy!"
5,Beautiful,"This book has made me just feel great, there are highs and lows, but in the end I feel like a better person"
2,I must be the wrong audience. I thought it was really lame.,"I think if you are in High School and involved in the Drama department, you would love this book.I am a middle aged adult and thought it was really lame. The made up narrator is a very self centered melodramatic teen. His friends are the high school drama dorks. It is fiction. For the first half, I thought I was reading someone's actual account of the title. When the story got hard to believe, I learned that was because it was made up. I read it through to the end and I laughed out loud a couple times, but I struggled to get through. I didn't care what happened to the main character because his teen angst, self pity and self importance irritated me. The line ""When they make a movie about my life...."" appeared several times. I do not think he did anything in the book interesting enough to warrant a movie.The book is not terrible, just highly over rated."
5,Read It!,"So, so funny. Told in a rare sensibilty, that makes no excuses for who he and his friends are. If you liked Joe Keenan books this is for you. Over the top while still being very believable."
5,Wonderful Suprise,"This book was so suprisingly good. I was judging a book by it's cover when I picked this book up. Also, the title was eye catching!This book, set in high school, has humor, intrigue, pranks, bisexuality and musical theater, just like the title suggests!A great read!"
3,Funny and Dysfunctional!,"I wasn't blown away by this book. I bought it because I have lots of friends in Portland and they wanted to get a better sense of who Marc Acito is before they bought tickets to Holidaze! I decided to help them out.How I Paid for College is a well written, comical, coming of age story. Every adult in the world can read this book and say "" Been there, done that!"" At some points however, I felt it was moving too fast and I couldn't keep up with all the connections and reference points. Maybe that's just because I'm getting old!! Too much time has passed since I was a teenager.Overall, I enjoyed it and my friends have tickets to Holidaze for next week!!Linda C. WrightAuthor, One Clown ShortOne Clown Short"
2,Not worth the time,"Marc Acito's book How I paid for College starts off fine. However after reading half of it I simply get fed up. Marc's problem is that many characters ""share the same voice""; many of the lines could have been said by almost anyone of the characters. My guess is that this is the author's own voice and that he lacks the skill to create individual plausable characters. This makes the book more boring than fun. The cover makes a reference to David Sedaris. I don't see the connection at all."
1,WORST BOOK EVER!,"This book is absolutely terrible. It is trying to be youth in revolt, and guess what. It isn't.They characters were unbelievable, the antics weren't funny and it is a good 6 hours of my life that I am never getting back."
1,"Oh, please!","The last few reviews sound rather similar, wouldn't you agree? And all written by folks who have never before written a review? Hmm. But anyway...I am currently reading this book, and it is quite enjoyable. I wish I could give it five stars, but wanted to stick it to whoever is behind this publicity charade.Funny, and well-written."
4,A great read about 2 of the top 3 STOL aircraft ever.,"I first flew in a DeHaviland DHC-6 Twin Otter in East Africa in 1970, and have been an avid fan of it ever since. This book reviews the history of the Twin Otter, and it's younger sibling, the Otter, with an exciting presentation and polished style that makes it hard to put down. Sean Rossiter did his homework when he compiled the information for ""Otter & Twin Otter (The Universal Airplanes)"". Any aircraft enthusiast who reads this book will immediately encounter the heartfelt adoration and respect of these awesome STOL (short take-off/landing) classics that Rossiter delivers to the reader. Go the the Pacific Northwest, and you'll still see these planes everywhere, heading out to the fishing camps and private lodges that dot the islands of Washington State and British Columbia. Rossiter captures the unique history of these workhorses with a keen and accurate style. Fellow bush plane enthusiasts, enjoy!"
3,You have to be a wing nut to love this book,"I wanted to read up on the history of the DHC-4 Twin Otter as I have flown on one here in the Sinai and am doing some historical research in their use with the Multinational Force and Observers.However, this book is not simply about Otters and Twin Otters but seemingly about every airplane in the DHC line. Only one short chapter really discussed the Twin Otter in the role I am interested in (although there is an interesting angle on the Otter I was not aware of and will now conduct additional research).The book goes into excruciating details about test pilots and engineers involved in the development of the Otter, the Beaver, the Caribou, etc. and not so much about the aircraft and which airlines and companies operate them.On the plus side, the book has a wealth of photos and the author clearly knows is subject. On the downside, however, the author would clearly rather be flying an Otter than writing about one."
4,Kya,"A very moving and tastefully filmed production. Glorious,rich color film. For some reason I only watch this movie when I am alone. To glean some understanding about what this film unfolds, the novel ""Orlando"", by Viginia Woolf, will not sufice. Read ""Vita"" by Victoria Glendinning (1983)to understand the film better. Of course, Vita Sakcville-West was enormously pleased with the novel ""Orlando"", but really didn""t understand it!! As a writer she was very popular, as compared to Viginia and her Bloomsbury set (at that time). ""Orlando"" is Virginia Woolf's ode to Vita (the child of aristocrats, who could not inherit her family's estate, since she was female, but who so adored the family homestead). Vita and Virginia were intimate friends, but Virgina's acute whimsy, or malice does poke fun at Orlando (the aristocracy). A light frolic from Virginia Woolf in love."
1,Horrible,"The other reviewers must not be familiar with the actual book. It should have been renamed and properly titled as ""based on Orlando by Virginia Woolf."" With each cliche liberty Potter took with the storyline my stomach churned a little more. The costumes are nice at least. My feeling is that this was an oportunity to create a masterpiece and they screwed the pooch. I would like to smack the director for Mrs. Woolf's honor if I could."
4,"Very Zen, very good.","This movie is one of those that you must be in the proper mood for. The pace is slow, and there are often long pauses in the dialogue, filled by the haunting, wide eyes of Tilda Swinton. But if you are relaxed and open to this movie, it is a wonderful experience. It is beautifully photographed, and spiritually fulfilling. Loved it!"
5,I watched in rapture...,"What and incredible waking dream.. This film left a lasting impression. I fell in love with the character with the aid of a fantastic storyline, amazingly beautiful countryside and wonderful musical score. I highly recommend this film"
3,read the book after this,"I read the book first as part of a literature class. I thoroughly enjoyed the book. The movie (maybe as always) leaves you wanting more. Cinematography, music were very good. Why can't the director include someone reading the excellent Woolfian interior narrative during the scenes where the protagonist is just staring at the camera? Is it money? Is this a new idea? Has the director read the book? So, it is OK, but the stares at the camera seemed like dead space."
2,"Different, Dull and Spectacular","ORLANDO is not the best movie I have seen, but it does have a small spice to it. Spectacular backgrounds, and sets lighten this semi-period piece up. This movie has some dull moments, and also goofy moments with Tilda Swinton looking at the camera, talking to the audience. The transformation from a man to a woman is un-discussed, making it alittle hard for the viewer to know why he or she did it. This movie was different, I will tell you that. Billy Zane's character (even though getting second most attention in advertising, and in the credits) is only on the screen for about ten minutes, has probably about 8 lines. I do not recomend this movie to be purchased, though if your a fan of such film noir -- DIG IN."
5,A Fascinating Work of Beauty,"Whether it was a mystical experience to watch because it pulled me out of the boredom of a dreary Sunday morning when it appeared on IFC, or whether it really is one of the most fascinating and hauntingly photographed films ever made...well, the jury is still out, and in fact it's probably both reasons. But I quickly obtained my own copy and have waited to watch it again because I so badly want to share this movie with someone. But it's a rare breed that will appreciate the story of a man who over time turns into a woman---a human being who tells a story of pain and obsession, heartache, war, and finally fulfillment in the truest love possible, across five centuries of different lives/same soul. A beautiful and artful rendition of the novel. I can't wait to unwrap mine one day and share it with the right friend... Could become an underground intellegentsia cult classic. (If it hasn't already and I'm really out of the loop.)"
4,Quirky and fun,"This movie is certainly worth watching. You are taken on a trot through about 400 years of British history from the perspective of the title character who is commanded not to age by Elizabeth I so doesn't. Orlando suffers somewhat as a man and inexplicably changes sex part way through film and has to deal with the unfairness of a patriarchally based system, and always has to deal with the issue of his/her longevity.Quirky and fun, I thought the acting was good, and the cinematography very good. A movie you will talk about after you watch it."
5,"the first ""free"" book",...because Woolf is able to be liberated and liberating despite the heavy shadow of her time. outstanding.
5,great movie,"despite the lamest trailer ever that does not even begin to give you the feeling of or for this movie, it is a really great movie. more than worth the $3."
3,This is one REALLY odd movie,"This is one really odd movie, I've never seen anything quite like it. I found the story interesting but strange at the same time. I'm not sure how historically accurate it is but the movie seems very well researched and loaded with tiny details that could so easily have been over looked or even left out, much better done than so many modern day setting movies. The plot mostly made sense to me although the passage of time seems dreamlike in later stages. I really liked the locations and costumes, weird as they were I think the clothing was probably exactly right for the times, remarkable achievement for what I think was actually a low budget movie."
3,read the book after this,"I watched the DVD of Orlando recently. I must say I was somewhat disappointed. The acting and the cinematography was breathtaking and excellent. But, with all of the unnarrated gazes directly into the camera, I thought that the film could have been enhanced greatly if some of the very rich interior narrative in the book could have been heard there (in those spots). Even if they needed to get a different voice to read it (Lynn Redgrave comes to mind), there were some paragraphs and sentences that we all noted (in my recent class on this) that could have gone well during these silences!"
1,Orlando,I was unable to watch the movie because the dvd didn't have the right region. I live in Norway. extremely irritating that the product I purchased and waited for to be shipped for over a month is worthless. Amazon should have sent me a dvd that I could have played in my region.
1,"Good Movie, Bad Copy","Orlando is a very good movie, visually stunning and well acted. The copy I received was plagued with dark spots, poor sound, and occasional freeze frames -- almost as if it was copied from a copyrighted original.The price was cheap (about $10.00 US); I gues you get what you paid for."
1,Disapointing,Orlando was a man and then an ageless woman who gave birth. It jumped about and was very confusing. I thought it quite rediculous and unbelievable.
3,The celluloid closet,"Hi! Sorry for this weird title, just wanted to draw your attention: I'm working on my dissertation paper on ""the representation of lesbians in US movies""... can you help me one way or another?katiabore@ifrance.comthan you"
4,It lingers...,"This seems like a movie you'd either love or hate. I'd never watch it with my boyfriend because he'd either say, ""Nothing is happening..."" or ""Wait- Why's he a *girl* now...?"" I found this movie incredibly thought provoking and haunting really- to think of all of the life lessons and challenges you could learn if you had 400 years to experience- To be a man and then suddenly be a woman and realize all of the rights that you had as a man that you took for granted. ""Orlando"" and ""Like Water for Chocolate"" are still the only two movies I've rewound immediately after watching them so I could watch it again and see what else I could ""get"" a second time around. If you liked ""Elizabeth"" and loved the costumes and the progress of gender issues throughout history, give it a shot."
3,It was OK,It didn't live up to the book. But I'm not sure anything could. Tilda Swinton's acting portrayed the characters very well.
5,"Virgiania Woolf, Orlando","One of the writers of the Bloomsbury group, Virginia was an integral part of the creative genius that poured from the minds of the time and the place called Bloomsbury. This is not a standard fare book or movie. It was a very clever story that like many times I liked the book better than the movie but the movie was great nonetheless. The frost faire in the beginning of the movie was wonderful being fully captured by the actress Tilda Swinton acting in a different role than normal as a young man falling madly in love in a strange circumstance. Humorous and interesting movie for a movie different than your standard fare. I love it."
3,Good book I just had problems with the ending.....,"I loved this book and finished it in one day. I loved because this sort of topic ( two minds in one body ) has never been done. It's just, the book seemed drawed out to long. I easily found out ( with my mind ) that DO NOT READ ON SPOILER, that she was Leonore. But the book disputed at the end that maybe she was Jaine. But they said no to this too! Please dear author of this book, before you attempt writing another book, finish what you started! The ending was rushed and did not explain good. After reading it I was in shock from the idea of the story and no proper ending. Good book.... but not for those who need a clear ending.Songstress Lenne"
5,The Haunted Sister The Best Book,"The book ""The Haunted Sister"" was a great book. It had suspence and action at the same time. It was a book that I couldn't put down. When I first started to read it I thought it was going to be boring, but as I read more it got so interesting. You think one think in the beggining and at the end you will be amazed what happens. You would never guess what happens in it. It was mesmorizing and a geat book. This is a book you will never put down when you start it.The book is wirten so well you can put your self in the main characters point of veiw. Read the Book "" The Haunted Sister"" and it will leave a Haunting memory of the book in you mind!"
5,Really good...,This book was really good. It is about a girl who startshearing her dead sister after an auto-accident. Like every book it hasa twisted ending. I thought it was really good.
5,Great Book,"OMG! I read this book years ago when I was in either Elementary or Middle school, and I have been looking for it for years! I loved it, and used to read it over and over, but I must have lost it, and I couldn't remember the title. I am so glad that I finally found it, I'm definitely buying it right now. Oh my gosh, I'm so excited to be able to read it again after all these years!!"
4,scars you phycologically!,"This book makes you think twice about the people that you come in contact with. I mean when you talk to some one you may not be actually talking to that person, or at least thats what this book is tryin to proseive. Haunted Sister is about a girl that gets in an acciedent that makes her dead sister live inside her body, it shows you how she deals with that and all the trials and tribulations that come along with the situation... I do recomend this book to you the viewers but if you dont like books that mess with your mind then this isnt the book for you!"
5,POUNCE Crunchy Tuna is my cat's all time favorite!,"My cat loves this treat! I've tried many treats prior to POUNCE and my cat would eat them all with no problem, until he was introduced to POUNCE Crunchy Tuna. Now he only wants this treat, because if he is given any other treat, he takes his time eating it or just walks away from it. With Pounce, he does tricks, recognizes the package and if he's in another room and hears the bag, he's running towards me!ABOUT THE SELLER...I was expected to receive delivery on August 17th, instead I received it the next day after placing my order! What a pleasant surprise! I will definitely order from this seller again!!!THANK YOU SO MUCH!"
4,Really fresh sugared ginger slices,"This is not ginger candy or even really like the crystallized ginger I am used to getting in the US. These are like large, thick, fresh ginger slices coated with large crystal sugar granules. The slices are soft with crunchy sugar on them. Lots of sugar--messy to eat. Also, you'll need a scissor or knife to open the inner package, which is odd. Once open, plan on sharing it with someone to finish it right away as it is too messy to put away half finished. This would be great for a pregnant woman having morning sickness or anyone fighting nausea. The flavor is not overpowering."
5,Nice scent,"I liked the Fa bath gel, so when I saw that they had deodorant, I thought it was worth trying. My current brand works well, but I get a little tired of the scent. I had no idea how Caribbean Lemon compared with the Fa bath gel I was remembering, but it seemed like the closest one. As it turned out, I think it may be the same scent, and regardless, the deodorant has a fresh, refreshing scent, kind of lemony with a hint of pine. It has the usual antiperspirant ingredient (aluminum chlorohydrate), which makes it an effective deodorant and antiperspirant (which also helps if you are stung by a bee - just rub it on liberally)."
3,slight difference than the old one,"I think there is something different than that i had it last year.I bought that from India, and it was original.This item,, i feel something is wrong with this.. i send 100% positive response to the dealer after receiving that product,but i used only last few weeks. This is okay for the purpose,.. but i wont buy this again onli"
1,Not worth reading,Did not care for it. Very old fashioned and took too long to get into story. Very slow moving and by the time you want to find interest you forget what the story line is.
3,One Wonderful Night A Romance of New York,This book was hard to follow at times. It was a mixture of a stiff 1800's romance and mystery with a little spy-like hide and chase. Some of the wording used was not of everyday normal speaking.
3,one wonderful night a romance in new york,this was an interesting book set in a early age when everyone was very proper i really enjoyed reading it
4,More Footnotes!!!,"These sixteen discourses from the Pali canon are a great introduction to Theravada Buddhism, one of the great creations of the human mind. The discourses cover basic Buddhist metaphysics, philosophy of mind, and ethics. I can't judge the accuracy of the translations from Pali, but the English is quite clear. Beginners looking to read primary Buddhist texts should start here. That said, I gave the book four stars instead of five because the editorial apparatus is a bit light. The editor, John Holder, introduces each discourse with a helpful summary of the key points, but many obscure or nuanced points within the texts are not explained."
3,Medea Cherubini,"The opera is a very interesting and rarely performed work. However, I purchased it ONLY because the conductor is Thomas Schippers. It is a ""live"" recording done at La Scala in 1961 and therefore the quality leaves much to be desired as far as the orchestra is concerned. Of course, Maestro Schippers was able to redeem nearly any orchestra he conducted! For those who are Callas fans, her performance is, as usual, exceptional. I would recommend it for its historic value and valid interpretation."
4,An Excellent Mastery of Music,"So dig I am not sure if you heard that wild piano on David Bowie's Alladin Sane. If you really dug that then you will dig Gerri's own brand of mastery over the piano. We have many sisters who can sing and many more who can ""sang""---but here comes an INSTRUMENTALIST. Rare and respectable!"
3,For the boys who loves the garbage truck,It's hard to read to kids but my son just loves to see the garbage truck and play with the alpabet.
3,cute book,this book is cute but not as good as the I'M DIRTY book. the story line is ok but the words are not as clever
5,Great book,This book is fun for kid's and adults both will love this book fun abd colorfull boof easy to read smnd as I said adults will love it. My Grandson sure dose he thinks it cool.
2,Eh. I had different expectations.,"I really wanted to like this book. We live in the city and my daughter loves to watch the trucks collect garbage and recyclables. But this trash truck character has a bad attitude. I'm not the goody-goody that sounds like. I just didn't like how the truck made comments like, ""Did I wake you? Too bad!"" or used ""Baby"" to refer to the reader, like some kind of swinger. It shifted the focus onto the attitude of the truck, and not the appreciation of an important city service. It tried to be too cool and in doing so makes it not such a great children's book.I did like the ABC portion where a trash was listed for each letter of the alphabet."
5,Who would have thunk it?,"I recently purchased this book for my 3 1/2 year old daughter as she is fascinated with big trucks and construction equipment. This has become one of her favorite books and she requests it read to her at least a couple of times a day. She also enjoys the sister book ""I'm Dirty""."
5,Fabulous Fun,We can't decide what about the book we like the most: the story or the illustrations. The dialogue of the trash truck is so entertaining especially if you put a lot of drama and fun into the way you read each of the pages. The pictures are colorful and whimsical. We review the book at least twice in each sitting and find something new in the illustrations each time. You will love the alphabet soup! This book is fabulous fun each time we read it.
2,Not So Great,"I liked the pictures, I liked the way the author puts in the 'alphabet of trash' and I liked the subject matter. It's great to teach kids to appreciate the hard work that the department of sanitation does.However, I REALLY disliked the attitude of the trash truck. The 'Did I wake you?? Too bad.' or the 'Outta my way!' My son is at an age where he definitely picks up and remember lines from books. I hear him repeating lines he's heard in books that we've read to him. The authors could have made the trash truck just as stinky and hard-working, but more likeable. No reason why he has to be so rude and inconsiderate.Also, the writing seemed too choppy. We read tons of children's books at our house, and this one is tough to read at times.I would have given it 3 stars if my son liked it more, but even he doesn't seem to gravitate to it as much as some of his other books."
5,Favorite of boys 2-4+,"We love this book! It's a bit tiring to read aloud with all the exclamation points, but the ""alphabet soup"" recipe guarantees lots of giggles. This truck has attitude to spare and then some. The art is terrific. Highly recommended!(...)"
2,Dissapointing,"This book leaves a lot to be desired. The story is poorly written, has very little substance and the sentences are very choppy. The author skips around and leaves a lot to be desired with what little story line there is. I thought the book would be great for my little boys - who love big trucks! But it doesn't really capture their attention."
1,The most awful book children's book I've ever read,"My son is 5 and loves cars, trucks, trains, tractors, you name it. He brought this book home from the library at school. This is definitely the most god-awful children's book I've ever read ~ and we read a lot. It's horribly written, does not flow well, and the illustration is dark and rather scary. I would never recommend this book to anyone. Honestly I'm shocked to find that this book has been so highly rated, because I truly fail to see why."
1,This garbage truck is RUDE!,"This has to be one of the worst board books ever. The garbage truck is so rude, here is a line from the book, ""Did I wake you? Too bad!"" This type of behavior and attitude is not something I want to teach my son."
1,This book STINKS!,"This book really rubs me the wrong way. The main issues are that the garbage truck is very rude and arrogant, and that it is glorifying trash. I think we should be showing our children examples of people treating each other with respect, and similarly treating the environment with respect. We should be talking about reducing or eliminating waste, recycling, etc. rather than eating trash. In reality the trash is going to a landfill. This linear system is not sustainable."
5,unparalleled depiction of garbage and where it goes,"This is a non preachy entertaining yet educational book that explains what goes into the garbage and where the garbage goes. De-stigmatizes trash collection. Makes us think about our consumption of goods and keeping a city clean. Our toddler loves yelling, ""I stink!"" I don't think there's any competitor."
1,No educational value,"Do not buy this book if you are teaching your child about composting and recycling or he/she will be very confused.Many of the things that go into this garbage truck go somewhere else in our house: apple cores, banana peels, egg shells, orange peels, rotten radishes, watermelon rinds, yams and jam jars to name a few ...I understand the authors were looking for items from A - Z but with a bit more effort I think they could have found other examples.The other confusing thing is that the garbage truck takes all the trash to the river to dump it on a barge and we are not told where it goes from there.Maybe this is how it's done in New York but still - let kids know where the trash really ends up and don't leave us with an image of trash on a barge."
2,I stink!,"The pictures in this book are reasonably good, but the text is lacking - and often times confusing."
1,This video was awful.,"My room mate played this for her four year old son, and I was appalled at the attitude of the truck. It had a very ""if I'm bothering you, TOUGH! Get over it!"" attitude. This is NOT the kind of lesson I want imparted to my children. The character is too direct, and needs to develop some manners!"
4,Cute Book,This book is cute for boys. I got it to go along with Stinky the Garbage Truck. The story includes lots of great sounds for kids to learn!
1,Want our copy?,"I got this book for our 19-month-old, who is obsessed with trucks of any kind. And he loved it. Loved it! But 3 days after I had gotten it for him, I had to ""disappear"" it. The book is so rude. I mean, I get that the truck is a garbage truck, and it's rough-and-tumble, but it has so much attitude that I think is hard to explain to a kid who's learning manners. It's all, get out of my way, and Did I wake you? Too bad! I think there's no reason to introduce such rudeness to your children just to get some truck love. If you're trying to instill manners in your child, do yourself a favor and skip this book. Try any of the Amazing Machines books about trucks, My Truck is Stuck! or the millions of others. Then you won't have to try to break your child of bad habits that s/he learns from this book."
1,Don't buy,I really don't care for this book at all. I don't like the sarcastic tone and the way that it reads. It's not interesting to my son at all.
2,Disappointing collection o films mostly forgotten - and for good reason,I have a pretty eclectic taste in films and am very prepared to make allowances - but I can see why this collection of 50 movies was so cheap. One or two worth watching; mostly not. This collection isn't box office Gold.
1,Box Office Gold 50 - movie pack,Item arrived as promised and in condition agreed - but the movies were poor quality and some of the movies were simply terrible. Well known stars before they were known or movies that never made it at the box office. Some were not even worth the time to watch. Do NOT recommend this product!
5,The Wildest! By Louis Prima featuring Keely Smith,"To all fans of jazz and swing! I recently purchased this CD and cannot stop playing it! All the tunes are GREAT and the recording sounds FRESH & LIVELY considering it was originally released on LP in October of 1956! Everyone knows Jump,Jive,An'Wail from The Gap commercials but there SO much more to the Louis Prima sound that needs to be HEARD and re-discovered!"
5,Excellent book on Annulments,"This is a very well written book with serious information for those who are considering an annulment through the Catholic Church. Fr. Foster is learned and knowledgable about Canon Law, and his website offers you the ability to have his expertise guide you through the annulment process. We were more than pleased with the results. I'm very glad I bought this book and had his help in preparing our annulment. It made things very easy and it became a healing process, not an anxiety ridden one. It was wonderful."
1,Buy Head and Shoulders Instead,"This stuff is the same formula as Head and Shoulders, and it gives the same lousy results. At these prices, it should work; but you can pick up the equivalent shampoo anywhere anytime."
1,No improvement,"Looking at other reviews, this seems like really great shampoo if you want to get rid of dry scalp and dandruff, but After 5 weeks of use, there is no improvement and the condition actually seems a little worse. Maybe the magic happens when you use both the shampoo and conditioner together (I am just using the shampoo right now). I will go ahead and order the conditioner and provide an update in the future of my results."
5,At Last!!!!,"I decided to wait a week on the release of this DVD collection and buy it at our local Best Buy. When I was finally ready to get it. I found out it was sold out there and everywhere I went. I spent all day Saturday looking for it and after 6 stops finally found it at a record store in a nearby town(I guess one of the draw backs of living in Small Town America), and they only had two copies left. I had no idea, and it pleases me to no end to know, that there is such a love and demand for this show. It is, arguably, the best comedy show ever made for television (sorry Seinfeld). Many thanks to whoever is responsible for this late Christmas present. Keep them coming!!"
1,Beware of Bad Green Acres Season 1 Lot,"I ordered Green Acres season 1 from Amazon and was surprised to find out of the 2 discs in the set disc 1 was in the case twice, there was no disc 2. I returned it back to Amazon for a replacement and the same exact thing happened. Has this happened to anyone else? I want season 1 but I am afraid to get another from the bad lot again, until the Amazon warehouse gets all of the bad lots out of their inventory."
1,AUTHORED BY ALF AND RALPH MONROE,"Worst authoring ever and I thought Sony was brain dead. The ""menu"" has only one choice... episodes!No skipping past the title sequences, you have to fast forward. Double sided DVDs do not show which side is up. What's up with that?The AUTHORING company has the nuts to have an annoying horrible ad after each episode for their inept services.The show itself... well you know how good it was... well maybe you don't know... what is it you don't know?"
4,Nostalgic viewing,Thoroughly enjoyed watching these reruns from when I was a child. TV humor through the years has bcome so sophisticated and it is a relief to see the 'innocence' of shows like this.
5,A great show,"My wife and kids (ages 2, 4 and 7) have spent many evenings together enjoying this great comedy. The dialog could almost work as an old time radio show (which Green Acres actually was years prior). I really get a kick out of themes and jokes that get carried over into later episodes, sort of like inside jokes. You can really see how the series hit its stride mid-way through the season.The film transfer is wonderful. I can really appricate the DVD picture quality when I compare it to the less-than-spectacular quality on DirectTV. My guess is this DVD looks better than the show did when origianlly broadcast. (Thank God these old shows were filmed rather than video taped!)MGM, I know I'm going to have a very disappointed family if you don't release season two before summer. Rest assured we'll be repeat customers. (Thank you for the great entertainment at a such a terrific price!)"
4,Better TV than Today,"It doesn't get much better than this. Most of the comedy on TV today is junk compared to how it used to be when I was much younger. I ordered seasons 1 thru 3 and wish they would release the final 3. Really good stuff and I enjoy watching them in order - the way it was meant to be. Money well spent IMHO.The DVD's work just fine for television, but take a little trial and error to figure out on a computer."
4,NO PLAY ALL FEATURE!!!!,"Like I said, no play all feature on the menu so you have to play each episode individually."
3,Green Acres,Man I just love the Acres but I'll be dead andin the ground before they release the rest ofthe seasons. Amazons' prices per 30min episodein this economy is a Crime!!!mn
3,OK SHOW BUT ANNOYING,"At times GA is overflowing with interesting surrealism but often a lot of corny country bumpkin humor, it's cynical in it's humor, and to be truthful there should have been more ladies in the cast other than Eva Gabor and Barbera Pepper. It's a really dated show we have no show quite like it on today (save for Paris Hilton's reality show). I like Petticoat Junction better with it's larger female cast and more positive humor. The GA characters of Eb and Kimball (especially Kimball in the second season on) are really annoying. I'll pass on this."
4,Thank you Jay Sommers,"Finally, the most sophisticated, bizarre, cork-screwed show of all time. Yes it starts a little slow, but that's only to show us what a mind-boggling world Oliver moves to. Once the citizens of Hooterville (get it? got it.....good) show up, it's every man for himself. Some of the wittiest dialogue ever written for TV is in this show. And anytime Mr Kimball shows up, logic goes out the door. Buy it...watch it.....laugh yourself silly and share it with today's kids....They'll LOVE it....well not love it....they might.....NO...that was last week."
5,I can't praise this enough!!!,This 32 episode DVD set of Green Acres may be the absolute best purchase that I've EVER made!!! HILARIOUS!
4,Green Acres is a great place to be!!!!,"This is a great price for 32 episodes of a classic tv show. I just hope they put extras on the other season sets if MGM releases them. But for now, just go buy it and maybey MGM will make the effort on season 2 and add some extras!"
1,not for me,I didn't have the patience for this -- first few minutes watching a thief / crook -- then boring scenes - then fastforward and didn't get better
3,Chance to see Hoffman in different light,"This movie is for Dustin Hoffman what Ricochet was for John Lithgow-- a chance to see a great actor depart from his typical performances or roles. This is a chance to see Hoffman a real lout. Even in movies where he started off as a lout, he eventually changes. He is a lout, through and through. It's also a chance to see cute Andy Garcia make an unethical decision and have to live with the consequences. It's not an even movie but entertaining, nonetheless. Other movies have done the same theme better but you'll like it."
2,"Informative, but lacking","This book is written from a mainly Kiwi (New Zealand) perspective, and focusses on the Souther Traverse. It does a pretty good job of explaining the origins of adventure racing, but lacks the bigger, more global reach of today's races. This book is informative, but is still lacking. Like ""The Toughest Race on Earth"", this book also lacks in explaining the true training and lifestyle of today's racers."
3,Good Primer,"This book would be an excellent choice for those just getting started in adventure racing (AR) or contemplating trying it and intending to do multi-day events. Experienced racers will also find some good tips, but might want to look for a more technical book if they want detailed information. It is a fast read and is well-written."
2,Marginally useful information,"I would recommend a different book. So far, the best one I have read is actually the e-book, ""How to Buy A Good Business at a Great Price"".This book lays out basic information for you, but I did not learn anything new.The main premise in this book, is that you need to get the seller financing to pay for 1/3 to 2/3 of the business, then you can finance the balance using business assets as collatoral.Great concept, but nothing new. The second half of this book is forms copied directly from the Internet, mostly SBA 7(a) loan document requirements. Nothing a 2 second google search wouldn't find.I read all the substance of this book in about 45 minutes. Again, NOT recommended, unless you have absolutely no clue at ALL about business finance."
2,Meh-Don't Bother,"I agree with the first reviewer. This book is of value only to someone with absolutely no business experience. It makes its point early, and doesn't bring much else to the table. The basic points are worthwhile, i.e. get professional advice, do your homework, etc. Beyond that, not much."
5,For this price??? It's a steal!!!,"Jean Renoir is one of the (deservedly) acknowledged masters of French cinema, and to get five feature-length films at this price is a steal. Although the films vary in quality, they're still Renoir films, and that's all you need to know."
2,Mostly home movie level stuff.,"Slow wandering early works. Pro communist Renior is loved by the critics, but he bores as you wander through this collection."
4,Baby's favorite,"My youngest LOVES this, he cannot go to bed without it. It has stained a bit after lots of teething done on it's poor ears and head. Overall though it stands up to everything! He carries it around by the neck. Worth the money!"
5,good quality candy mold.,"Wonderful product, quick shipping. No complaints. Chocolate removed easily when cooled. I suggest u buy more than one if u r making a lot. I wish u had bought at least two because I made 30 lollipops and it took a while."
5,i did this once,"It was a candy mold of moustaches - just as pictured. We were happy.(thought I already put a review of this in already, but I guess not.)"
5,mustache lollipops,Wonderful! Perfect and easy to use they shipped really fast and were very cheap for the quality of the items I bought 5!
5,great product!,I ordered this product to make favors for my mustache themed baby shower. They were delivered a lot faster than i had thought they would be and that made me even happier! I purchased 4 trays as i had to make 60 of them and there are only 4 molds per tray. The finished product came out great and they were an awesome way to say thanks to our guests!
3,Cute!,"I got these for my son's Milk and Cookies birthday party. These were ""milk mustaches."" My only complaint was that the plastic was slightly warped."
5,Love it!,They were the perfect size for valentine suckers. Easy to use and the chocolate popped right out of the mold after hardening.
5,Very nice,I received this item quickly and it was of great quality. I have used it and am very happy.This was my first experience using a chocolate mold and the mustaches came out perfect!!
4,easy to use,I bought this for my baby shower and it made the perfect party favors super easy to use and clean. It would have been better if it had more than four to a mold though.
5,came out perfect!,"Used this mold for a mustache bash baby shower for my sister-n-law. It was a big hit! Super easy...literally just melted the chocolate, inserted the lollypop stick and let set for like 25 minutes...popped out easily from the mold."
5,"Painless, fun and easy way to learn Spanish",I learned to speak and understand basic Spanish with this course and I never had to guess at meanings (they were all provided). The voices were excellent and the overall level of proficiecy that I was able to achieve in just three weeks astounds me!
4,Fun Read and Enlightening,"Rufin's story is great adventure told by a subtlety humorous narrator-no small achievement given the seriousness of Brazil Red's themes. This would also be a terrific book for advanced young readers, age fourteen and up. A rare book that makes history real, entertaining, and meaningful. Because of its child protagonists, Just and Colombe, Brazil Red favorably reminded me of Philip Pullman's The Golden Compass."
2,The Ups and Downs,"After seeing them live, almost any album would be a let down. I recommend seeing them play live, it is a great show. They haven't learned how to make a good album yet, and it shows. They sound a lot like Coldplay with some Third Day thrown in. The first and last tracks are standouts (""please"" and ""everything is ok"") but they are weak up the middle. Don't spend a bunch on the CD, but it's worth it at a low price. I think they will be very good with time and another album"
5,Great follow-up!,"If you liked the first book, you'll love this one too! There is nothing like sitting down to a good book and simply enjoying the characters and the story the author brings to life. You will find yourself cheering on Reece and Connor as they face the challenges set before them. There is a lot of talk about God and how to find Him and what to do after you do; some might want more story, but if you look at the whole, you see that the town is stuggling with finding it's way to the true light. So many people back then thought you only had to ""do good and pay your tithe's"", but it's so much more than that and that is what these characters are finding out. You'll love the continuing story of Jace and Maddie. Hope you like it too."
2,Boring,This book was really dreadfully boring it had a good plot and good story behind it but nothing more just plain boring i had to skim through pages to get throut it....
1,Fantastic movie....But not this version!,"Just on the basis of viewing the 1st 2mins of this version of Get Carter, I would never purchase the DVD. I've seen the original (UK) version of it, and this ain't it!Why were Sid Fletcher's and Geralds' voices overdubbed?!?!?!? God only knows what else was edited and overdubbed!Charlie Tesoro"
3,A tough and not too interesting mov,"MY RATING- 6.3This is a mov I watched for only having one of the greatest actors of all time- Michael Caine.The film develops in a strange way almost in a Raymond Chandler flair but this one is set on British locations. The story turned to be a bit disapoitting at the end and it gets even more bizarre with that music!However it features one of the hottest girls of the 70's, Britt Ekland. Look at that erotic phone call made by Caine! Look also for ""The Avengers"" first season star Ian Hendry.Overall, a tough and almost mean mov that is not for all tastes."
3,Get Carter (3.5/5),"Michael Caine stars in this revenge crime drama as a Gangster from London who decides to look in to the suspicious death of his brother.his investigation ends up ruffling some feathers,and Jack becomes a target.i won't say anything else about the story.you'll have yo watch the movie to find out more.i' will say that this is not what you would call an action packed movie.it moves at a moderate pace.it's not boring.things are always happening,just not at a frenetic pace.and every scene occurs for a reason,even if it doesn't appear that way.at least that's the impression i felt.but it's really the acting that's the anchor here.Caine is great as the title character who won't give up,until he finds the answers.the supporting cast is also good.for me,Get Carter is a 3.5/5"
3,ok like the other one better,first off i do not care for micheal caine second he is no action star the movie seemed long and boring at most parts my favorite part in the whole movie was the end i know by writng this i am making alot of people mad cult classic no
1,England? Really?,"I had little patience with this movie because I thought I was going to see a bit of England. That's because I didn't know there were two versions both starring or co-starring Michael Caine. Consequently, as far as I could see it was inexplicably about Americans (apart from Michael Caine), Americans talking to other Americans and driving on the American side of the road with American stop signs. Why, I thought, would they do that in England, and where were the British scenes? Finally I realised that I was dealing with a re-make and one perhaps not as good as the original.Apart from that it was violent and boring. People smoking cigarettes, indulging in small talk with no brilliance, beating people up, driving recklessly and getting bloodied. I don't get it. I need to see the 1971 one, unless the script is the same of course. No actor can, I fear, do much for the plot and dialogue I sampled."
4,Artistic Action Movie,"So there is this guy named Carter (Michael Caine) who works for the mob in London. He's not a nice guy, though he does seem to have a way with the ladies. He also has an aura about him that makes him unmistakably cool.At the beginning of the film Carter learns that his brother has died under mysterious circumstances, so he journeys to the industrial town of Newcastle to figure out what's going on. During the course of his investigation he manages to anger his employers so he ends up taking on the whole world alone, much like a detective from a classic novel or film.The movie has a slow pace, like many of the cop movies from the late sixties and early seventies. It's also shot rather artistically for an action film, so it's not for everyone, but if you're looking for a film with a cool, somewhat unlikeable protagonist who's out for revenge and will stop at nothing to get it, than this might be for you. It's very similar to the film ""Payback,"" in that regard."
1,boring and uninvolving,"gritty, though it is, this movie is very boring. caine turns in an ok performance, but the only saving grace of the movie is some quite beautiful nude girls. other than that, nothing else worth mentioning. stick with the godfather if you want a good crime movie"
4,The original get carter movie,"Great movie, I highly recommend it. The action and suspense are what makes this movie so compelling to watch. Go for it,"
1,bad experience,received dvd that would not play in my area. attempting to exchange now for one that will play in louisville ky
5,great film,"Get Carter should not be missed by any one loving noir or gangster films. It is an absolute masterpiece of the genre, of any genre. Michael Caine as always delivers a pitch perfect performance. One of the truest actors ever. The quality of the DVD is also very good."
4,Michael Caine at his best!,"Michael Caine recently won his second Oscar for supporting actor, but if you really want to see him at his best, ""Get Carter"" is the movie to see. Caine loses his English version of the ""good old boy"" for this film as he investigates the death of his brother in England. He is tough and vengeful and shows why he is one of the best actors in the business, now and nearly 30 years ago when this film was made. There is a remake of the film in the works but I don't see how it can ever measure up to this one. One of the best ganster movies ever!"
1,Absolute CRAP - Low-DEF !,"Must say I was very disapointed.The only reason I bought this DVD was beqause it was ""Filmed in Hi-DEF"" and they go on and on about the Excelent Hi-DEF quality.Well guess what, as soon as you open everything they have written on the DVD it self ""This DVD has been down-converted to work with existing DVD technology."" So there is no Hi-DEF quality to be seen here and it is actually lower quality than any other DVD I ever tested.I'm looking forward to the day when you will be able to search for actual Hi-DEF movies on Amazon and find some movies that are actually Hi-DEF when you play them ;-)So any way neither as an Aquarium DVD or Hi-DEF is this disk any good.Best Regards"
4,Very relaxing and pretty,"Perhaps I'm not as visually discerning as the other reviewer, but I thought this was quite nice for background viewing. I have a 40"" screen and a DVD that ""upconverts"" (not sure if that's the right word) and when viewed at normal ratio (not widescreen) it looks great. At widescreen, it's still acceptable for background. The fish are pretty and although I've seen better aquarium videos, this one is very nice and colorful."
1,Love tossing Horseshoes? Well toss these right in the garbage!,"Two of the horseshoes broke on their very first toss, and another after 3 tosses. No surprise, as you get what you pay for, but I did not follow that rule and purchased this set, to my regret."
1,Horrible product!,"Do not order this product! The product that I received was missing one horseshoe, did not have a protective bag as the picture shows, and it was completely dirty. Not just dusty but actual caked on dirt was covering the set. I was refunded my actual cost but still ended up having to pay for the return shipping. This was a defective/dirty product and I should not have had to pay anything. Waste of my money!"
4,Tyranny On Trial,Excellent condition for used book. Content good. Pictures in book not good. Great first person telling of actual historic event.
2,Disappointing,"Turn Left at the Black Cow offers Fred Astaire fans some wonderful anecdotes, as the legendary dancer visits his daughter and her husband in Ireland. However, author McKenzie's constant name dropping and continuous negative comments about Fred's second wife wear thin. Worth a look, but feel free to skim."
1,Not working,I gave this as a birthday gift but apparently something is wrong with it because the light doesn't work. I am having my husband try to fix it because it's too much of a pain to have to send it back.
1,Very Sad!,"I've been ""saving up"" and buying Christmas presents all year. Bought this as a Christmas Present for my son back in September 2008. It has been in a box in a closet till today, Christmas. We do this to make it possible to do Christmas WITHOUT credit cards. Well, today my son opened it and the lights DO NOT WORK. Big disappointed! Amazon tells me we have passed the ""return window"" so we cannot return it and it is junk. Lesson learned, to buy bigger items locally."
4,Excellent Revelaton on Jews for Jesus,"This very personal account of nice-Jewish-girl Ellen's years as a missionary in Jews for Jesus reveals the power, control, and decpetion that can be found in such groups, and the difficulty in breaking away. Kamentsky's writing is balanced while remaining honest and self-revealing. For anyone who deals with cults, cult-like groups, and invasive religious missioniaries ""saving"" Jewish souls, this quick read is well-worth seeking out in a used copy or at a library and then sharing with parents, teenagers, clergy, and friends. Ultimately, her story is an inspiring one of her family's love and the finding of a faith."
5,books by Victoria Holt,"No one beats Victoria Holt when it comes togothic mysteries. I have read all her books,and bought this book to give to a friend,who likes to read."
3,It's OK,"I really wanted to like this novel, but found myself struggling just to finish it. The plot was good, it just seemed to me that overall it was missing that little extra something. The ending seemed to sneak up on me too, after half the book was devoted to her trying to solve the mystery. I am going to read another Victoria Holt book and hope for a better experience."
4,Great!,This was my second VH book and it was just about as wonderful as the first. The new worlds it took me to was awesome and I could feel the emotion and suspense that Rosetta was going through!
4,A noble man,"This is one of my favorite of Emilie Loring's books. Written during the first half of the twentieth century, her books charmingly and authentically capture the flavor of their periods. This story tells of Anthony, a young man who in the excess of drink, crashes into and kills another young man who was his mother's main support. Anthony offers to take his place, which also means becoming a brother to the little girl, and managing the family's commercial orchard. The romance that develops years later is enhanced by the courage and dedication to his promise that he has shown. The romantic episodes are delightful and poetic, and never vulgar. Emilie's books (the ones SHE wrote before she died in 1950), are always clean, and include a mystery along with the romance, with interesting characters and lively dialogue."
3,"Nice story, but...","I truly liked the story. Romance, humor and Irish ambiance in quite a balanced mix. However, I could not help noticing the similarities of the plot to Nora Robert's ""Born in Ice"": a bestselling American novelist with a histoy of abuse as a child rents a room on a farm in rural Ireland, near Galway. The landlady is shy at the beginning but manages to secure the skeptic novelist's heart by the time he is supposed to leave for home. I repeat, I liked Ross's story fine, but would have appreciated a more ""original"" storyline better. By the way, Robert's books is superb."
5,Touching love story,"Years after the death of her beloved mother and husband, Nora Fitzgerald is struggling to keep her family together. When her father rents a room to an American writer visiting Ireland to make a movie, Nora is secretly happy because the money is needed.Quinn Gallagher just plans to make his movie and leave Ireland behind, but is drawn to the beautiful widow. After a lifetime of closing his heart, can he open his heart to this wonderful and forgiving woman?JoAnn Ross brings us a wonderful love story that brings the reader to the beautiful rolling green hills of Ireland. This is more than a romance, this is a story of family, legends and community. Highly recommended."
2,Very difficult to give this a rating,"Of course this album starts off with the anthem ""Lunatic Fringe"", great song, well mastered and the reason that I bought the CD. Since I had never really heard any other music by Red Rider, I wanted to give the album a chance. Don't bother. Although the engineering and mastering quality is good, the music is extremely forgettable. If you buy this CD buy it just for ""Lunatic Fringe"". I understand why this was a flash in the pan group. Furthermore the enclosed CD liner notes are not informative."
4,Red Rider review,"I like this selection of music from the 80's. ""Lunatic Fringe"" really rocks,but the other songs are fairly good, too."
3,One Hit Wonder,"Red Rider hit the charts in the '80s with LUNATIC FRINGE, a classic, haunting and weird tune with a memorable sound. It's the kind of song that would be great in a documentary about space travel, sci-fi stories, etc! If only for this one song, this CD is worth the price."
1,Awful Music,Lunatic Fringe blah blah I know your out there your in LA. This song sounds like he's killing a cat. this is one of my top 4 worst songs ever. Last is Luka then Radar Love then Lunatic Fringe and finally Rock you like an Hurricane.
5,Am I only person ordered this?,I ordered Jan.1st but I don't know what's going on.Please tell me thereis no problem.
1,boring and boring,"I bought this flick to compare to 1981 issue with Silvia Kristel and, well, result is...boring. For obvious reasons I expected in 1992 somehow higher standards but, instead,...boring. Endless talking dont bother me but choice of actors does. I should state I didnt like any actor in this movie whereas in previous one everything was almost perfect. English movies are notoriously boring and and this one not an exception.It started promising with some class clashes but...boring."
3,Nearly Lawrence??,"The movie follows the book somewhat. The groundskeeper ia a bigger, more handsome than the book. Mrs. Bolton seems fine,and Lord Chatterly ok too. Altogether, the movie is enjoyable."
3,Disappointing,"If I did not know this was Ken Russel's work, I would mistake it for a run-of the-mill BBC mini series. OK, but not exciting. There is no chemistry between the lady and her lover. Sir Clifford (the husband) is more likeable than Mellors (the lover) -- that should tell you something. Russel's work falls especially flat after seeing a superb new French version of Lady Chatterley by Pascale Ferran. For me, Ferran's is the ultimate interpretation of D.H. Lawrence's work, exquisitely filmed and peopled with passionate and believable characters."
2,terse and irregular,"i have a 1996 edition of this book which, oddly, i purchased in 1999. let the buyer beware: they do not update this book on a very regular basis as far as i can tell. there are interesting and useful facts in the school profiles, however, no two schools have exactly the same ""questions"" answered in their profiles, making it difficult to compare schools because there are few easily viewable commonalities. students are not interviewed and the profiles seem to be direct quotes from the press releases offered by individual schools. therefore, as an art student myself, i have found it much more useful to visit the webpages and campuses of the colleges i am interested in, consulting ARCO as little as possible."
4,"Patato-the legend, the drum!","Patato shines through on this overall excellent recording. If you like your Afro-Cubano a bit on the ""Afro"" side, then this recording is bound to please. For those new to the genre, Patato is not only an original, but perhaps one of the foremost innovators in the development and advancement of the conga drum sound. He has played with all of the greats, including the late Tito Puente. Orestes Vilato plays timbales on many of the cuts, which is also a plus for lovers of percussion. Goza!"
2,A bit overhyped,"In the late 80s and early 90s, modern jazz made a comeback thanks to the sales of the Marsalis brothers. The Harper Brothers, a hard bop outfit that sounded like a throwback to the 50s, benefited. This now 21-year-old live cd shows them at the Village Vanguard at the height of the hype. But listening to it today, it doesn't make a lasting impression. The soloing is all over the place, immmature. It's tight, but where are they today?"
5,Wonderful for sustained energy,I love this product and take it every day. I feel a sustained energy as though I had eaten a lot of fresh fruit.
5,I recommend this product,"My son, age 12, likes this shoulder rest better than any of the others we have tried. The fact that it is collapsible makes it easier to store and keeps it from getting broken at school."
4,My daughter likes it.,"Kun Collapsible 3/4-1/2 Violin Shoulder RestIt is built well. It is compact and simple. It folds to fit in the violin case conveniently. My daughter loves it. I don't go that far because of the price, but it is a whole lot more expensive at the local store!"
1,Low Budget and Outdated,"This video is low budget and outdated. The audio quality is very poor, the video is poorly shot and edited, and the instruction is mindless. ""Coach"" Vogelsinger's instruction amounts to simple directions which he demonstrates. But all you hear is his garbled, high-pitched voice saying ""There... and there.... and there..."" which is supposed to highlight some technique. He never looks at the camera and the audio seems dubbed. After his demonstration there is footage of students trying the moves.It contains grainy old footage of NASL and World Cup matches. This video is at least ten years out of date."
1,it was ok.....,"I have just started to read manga, and Evils Return really dissapointed me. The artwork was good, but not a lot happend in the story. It was boring, there were to many pictures and not enough talking, and i don't like any of the characters. There was mild language and i found myself often looking at an almost naked girl. Don't waist your money on this manga. Although this is only my opinion, i'm a teen after all."
4,Thought Provoking,"I also wondered why Chris chose the streets over the comfort of his mom's home, but I guess that's what made the story line. Since reading, everytime I'm approached by a panhandler, I have to wonder if there is a Chris or Steve underneath."
4,ok,"this book was an ok, read. i was really glad how steve changed his life around, even though he still had to pay for former things he did wrong. I didn't understand why chris would have rather slept on the street, than move back in with his parents until he got back on his feet."
4,Good Read!,"I heard about this author and his novel in a magazine and started looking for the title everywhere. After being unsuccessful, I realized I could order it from Amazon........and so goes the story. What a great book! I wasn't sure where the author was going to take Steve and Cris but Mr. Holly did a fine job at breaking down and rising up his characters. The author touches on some very real-to-life issues of race, politics and humanity. The book ends leaving you with a feeling of how great of a story teller the author is. I look forward to reading future work of Mr. Holly."
4,Starts a little harsh,"The beginning sequence is Larry having a nightmare, and made me really doubt if I wanted to continue. Maybe it was because the music is really loud compared to the rest of the video, or because it didn't make any sense. Either way, that part still bugs me every time my kids want to watch it.However, the songs are good and ones we like. And that's the point of having this DVD. So I'll deal with the beginning, like how you have to eat the brussel sprouts before you get dessert..."
4,It Brought Back some Memories,"I actually bought this as a gag gift (inside joke) for my friend's 21st birthday but we did sit down and watch some of the ""Veggie Tales Sing Alongs: End of Silliness"". It brought back some great memories from our childhood and I'm sure all the kids out there will love it."
4,"Too ""Golf Shirty"" for Me","I bought this shirt and received it Wednesday, but after putting it on, I feel like I'm on the LPGA ... a little too ""Anika Sorenstam-y"" for my liking."
4,Ok to buy,The book is okay for Yogananda Devotees and as one can well imagine stories are kept in line with AYB but they are muted by comparrison. A good read for those who are SRF affiliated but the best part was the back of the book where the author was more original in his own writings.
1,Terrible!,"I wish I had paid attention to the first reviewer rather than the two who gave this a decent rating, or read the excerpt at the other reviewer did and discovered bad errors.There is nothing in this book that hasn't been said before, it's a cheaply made book, and the author's personal remarks are often dramatically off the mark.Don't buy it. Whedon has already had an excellent guide of the first half of the episodes of Firefly published, with the second guide for the rest of the series run to be released soon."
1,don't own it but...,"i haven't bought this, but by looking through the excerpt here i noticed not only did the author mess up on zoe's last name but book's first name(both totally incorrect, not just mispelled), and i believe also misspelled kaylee's, but i could be mistaken on that last one. the fact that there are two glaring errors right in the beginning tell me that this is not worth your time because obviously the author did not do her research. all you browncoats out there, and just people curious in firefly, go buy the official companions, they are accurate and have cast and crew commentary(a far better buy)."
4,Worth your time,"I almost didn't buy this because of the extremely negative review from TigWolf. Well, I'm glad I did. While not approaching the quality of ""The Official Companion"" or the focus of the essays in ""Finding Serenity"" this is a very good read and it shows that at least one Firefly fan can write and get published their thoughts on the best show to ever be on TV. TigWolf - write your own book and let us read it. I'll be waiting..."
5,My favorite Romance Novel to date,"A great read for fans of romance set in an Americana setting. It's for readers who enjoy a true love story between two grown-ups. Surpisingly, the romance between the two lead characters stayed with me long after I put the book down. If you like a lot of physical intimacy in your romance novels, this book is not for you. But you'd be doing yourself a disservice by not reading it. The interaction between the two lead characters keeps you captivated. Stef Ann's storytelling abilities shine in this book. She makes you feel like you've lived in Harmony all your life. I normally don't save my books, let alone read them a second time around, but this one is staying on my bookshelf!"
3,Okay - but not great,"When I bought my little yellow lab puppy, I searched the internet and scoured reviews to buy the best book to prepare me for my new endeavor. I purchased this book, and I am sad to say, I was a little disappointed. It barely skims the surface of each topic, and did not prepare me to be a first-time puppy owner, or a first-time lab owner. I highly recommend Barron's ""Training Your Labrador Retriever"". I just bought it (my puppy is three months old) and I wish I had bought it first - it has much more information on how to handle your new puppy!"
3,Overrated but still worthwhile if only for the beats,"I've been hearing about how great this disc is since '98 (it was recorded in '97) but, alas, it was not released until now. Maybe it's inevitable that I would feel let down. Sonically the album's on-point. It's the ryhmes that are a let down. Jay Dee, like Puffy before him (okay he's better than Puff) should've stayed behind the boards. The lyrics themselves are fine (if a bit mysogynistic at times) but the flow is perhaps too lazy and low-key. It makes them hard to keep up with at times because they're so boring. I do appreciate the cameos by Q-Tip and Busta Rhymes, two MC's that could show the guys of Slum Village a thing or two."
4,ANOTHER MUST HAVE HIP HOP ALBUM,"YO WHAD UP! THIS ALBUM IS SO CLASSICAL WIT ITS SMOOTH BEATS. SONGS LIKE ""FALL IN LOVE"", CLIMAX SH**T, AND THE SONG FEAT. D'ANGELO ARE ALL SMOOTH CLASSICAL BEATS. THIS ALBUM REMINDS ME OF MOS DEF, COMMON SENSE, ROOTS, AND ALSO DEAD PREZ. IF U LISTEN TO ANY OF THOSE GROUPS U WILL LIKE THE ALBUM BY SLUM VILLAGE. COP THE SMOOTH CLASSICAL ALBUM."
4,Don't call them Tribe,"After a LONG wait, these three Detroit hip-hoppers finally get their music out on the independent level. For the average hip-hop lover... its worth the wait! Jay Dee's enchanting soundscapes are worthy of three stars by themselves, and while a bit more complex lyricism would really have set off the beats, that's not what the group is about. They're about FUN, as you can hear on the playful tracks featuring Busta Rhymes and Kurupt.They've been compared ever since they arrived on the scene with vintage A Tribe Called Quest, and Q-Tip doesn't do anything to wipe away that comparison with his appearance on the album (he raps: ""I'ma leave it in the hands of the Slum now""). But ""SV"" carves out their own niche with this album, packed with enjoyable punchlines, fun bouncing cadences, and subtly magnificent beats. Easy to rap along with-type lyrics are layered over resonant snare/handclap/vibes to end up with a head-nodding hip-hop treat."
5,Among my top 3 favorite hip hop albums,"I have a hard time saying this is one of the top hip hop albums ever because the lyrics are somewhat iffy, but their delivery along with the beats is some of the best-produced hip hop I've ever heard. Every track is strong, and it is hardly repetitive. A very unique sound from one of hip hop's best producers (RIP Jay Dee). Also, SV changed members around after this album so hear Slum Village in their original (and in my opinion, brilliant) form."
4,"Nothin' ""Slum"" about this group!","Slum Village's Fantastic, Vol.2 is classic feel good, vibe type, and soulful album. The beats, the beats, THE BEATS!!!! JayDee is a hot producer. I am sure the industry knows him, but the hip-hop listeners who don't know who he is will have no choice to move to his sounds especially when he becomes a ""household name"", sort of speak. The rhymes are not the most lyrical but JayDee, T3, and Baatin knows how to keep the vibe going with their harmonous, sing-songy soulful hooks, and their braggadocious rhymes, matching the beats. If they continue to make great music and improve more and more on lyrical content. Labeled as the future ""A Tribe Called Quest"", it's not hard to tell that they were influenced by Tribe, but they are not trying to be Tribe. And that is a good thing. SV keeps this up plus get their lyrical skills to equal the superior production, they will be a force to be reckoned with!!"
4,The SV represented well in this overlooked near-classic,"If you are getting tired of watching hip-hop kill itself with fake gangsters and materialism, you may like this joint. Featuring the production stylings of Jay-Dee, this LP features tight lyricists and killer beats. SV can keep it ""gully"" with the best of 'em, but like the best hip-hop artists, they want to get the crowd moving. With tracks like ""Conant Gardens"" (which reminds me of the Jungle Bros.' ""Straight Out the Jungle""), ""Tell Me,"" ""Fantastic,"" and ""2U4U,"" they do just that. That Louis Armstrong skit was classic.I can count on 2 hands the number of hip-hop records I've bought in the last 2 years. This is one of them and also one of the best I've heard in a while. I hope eventually this Detroit crew gets their due."
4,Hip-hop celebration!!!,"Guys are just enjoying themselves on this one. I picked this album last summer and I prefer playing it when I'm in a company of women. It's dope and I wouldn't make a fuss about the lyrical content and other things that hip-hop underground cats might be looking for in a JD produced album. If you wanna sit back and relax on a hip-hop tip, this album is a must. I would advise all my underground cats all over the world to buy it, your women will definately bounce to your music (for a change). No woman has ever liked my music, but since I bought the Village, my woman has learnt to live with the kind of music I listen to. Climax... is every woman's favourite track in the album. Pick it up for your woman's sake.... it's a brilliant laid back hip-hop album."
4,hip hop heads review,"certainly not the tightest rappers or lyricists around but slum village have created a solid cd. jay dee is a great producer and has many gems on this cd includingi dont know,tell me,whats it all about with busta,fall in love and raise up. if you only enjoy rappers with complex lyrics you may not enjoy slum village, but if you like interesting laid back beats you better cop this cd"
4,So close to classic,"Ah, Slum Village. The group Tribe Called Quest bequeethed as the their successors. But, they fall a little short of what TCQ reached. There are five tracks that stand out as great songs. But, what Slum Vill got trapped in is the constant love themes that plagued TCQ's last album The Love Movement. While the MC's voices are layed back to a point that it seems effortless to them, their lack of enunciation is sometimes a problem. It seems like the lyrics were unimportant at times, and most of the beats do not make up for this problem. I think that if they could find a common ground like TCQ's earlier albums, they could be even better than Q-Tip and Pfief Dog, but with Fantastic Vol. 2, it's close but no cigar. Not that the LP isn't recommended, it is, but it's not The Low End Theory. So, you have been warned."
4,A Hip Hop classic,"I'm not a big fan of the rap game but I still try to keep up with it. This cd turned me around though. This is the best hip hop cd that I have heard in a loooooong time. This is the only cd that i've listened to regularly since D'Angelo's new release of Voodoo. And what's even better ...they are from the Motor City D town baby! This cd has got a lot of flavor with appearences from Q-tip, Busta Rhymes, D'Angelo,Pete Rock and the list goes on. I will definetely be rollin to this one this summer. PEACE!"
4,ANOTHER ALBUM THAT PEOPLE WILL SLEEP ON!,"YO, WHAD UP I JUST WANT TO SAY THIS ALBUM IS PRETTY TIGHT. I WAS TRYING TO GET THIS ALBUM THE FIRST TIME IT CAME OUT BUT I WAS IN JAX, FL. FLORIDA HAVE NOT EVEN HEARD OF THESE BOYZ B 4. SO I HAD TO WAIT TWO DAYZ LATER. IF I WAS IN VIRGINIA WHERE I AM FROM. I WOULD HAVE GOT IT THE FIRST DAY. OK ENOUGH OF MY LITTLE PROBLEM. THIS ALBUM REMINDS ME OF ALBUMS LIKE COMMON, ROOTS, MOS DEF, AND THOSE KINDA OF DEEP RAPPERS. IT IS LIKE THIS, IF U LIVE UP NORTH MORE THAN LIKELY U WOULD LIKE THIS ALBUM. BUT IF U STAY DOWN SOUTH, YOU PROBABLY NEVER EVEN HEARD OF SV BECAUSE OF THE PUBLICITY THAT IS HAS DOWN SOUTH. IF U LIKE RAPPERS LIKE COMMON, ROOTS ETC... U WOULD LIKE SV. PEACE."
1,THIS ITEM IS NOT BLACK,"This item appears solid black in the pictures, but is in fact purple and green striped. The company should provide better pictures or include the colors in their items description. It is ridiculous that I have to spend my money on shipping to return this item when its description is incomplete and the pictures misleading."
2,Not what I thought It would be,"Appears to be black or a dark blue color on the picture showed...which it is not.Acutually, in person it is bright purple and green, so it doesnt match all my mats.Quality appearts to be ok however."
2,Hugger Mugger Harness,"Sadly, there must have been a sewing error when the harness I received was made. One of the straps is permanently ""backwards"" to the other, and so it must be twisted to get it to fasten. This makes it a bit awkward to use, especially after class. I had a few of my friends examine it, just to make sure I wasn't wrong... and sure enough, it is sewn on backwards."
3,"Sturdy, but unnecessary trouble","A sturdy harness but there's a lot happening and you'd be better off going with a more simple design. Once you adjust the straps once, you'll find that you need to roll your mat up EXACTLY the same every time or else you'll have to re-do them. Not as easy as it sounds when you're trying to pack up quickly while the next class shuffles in.I'd say go for a velcro strap over buckle."
4,Mat sling,"Im really satisfied with this product. The price was fantastic. The pattern is a bit 80's. Also, when tightened around a mat, the tails are really long and I have to tuck them into something to keep them form being in the way. Over all though, I'm glad I made this purchase."
4,Delightfully surprised!,"I had never heard of Michael McGarrity, and found the cover and the plot summary both a bit off-putting, and wasn't expecting to like this book. I was delightfully surprised to discover that unlike many writers in the murder, mayhem and mystery genre, McGarrity didn't slipslide at all into the murky depths of horrifying psychotic evil, gratuitous garbage-language,-sex,-blood,-gore and cruelty, and wallow there for several hundred pages.He wrote a book about a psychotic killer, yes, but he didn't allow his writing to sink to the level of the killer. It's a very good book with breadth and depth even with a ""less-is-more"" control over the verbiage, which I like and respect. His story line and characters are engaging. The mystery is compellingly presented. I finished it and rushed to my nearest bookstore to buy all the other Mike McGarrity murder, mayhem and mystery books and have since read them and found them as engaging as Everybody Dies! Keep on writing, Mr. McGarrity!"
1,Formula Writing,After about one fourth of the way into this book I began skimming pages and still easily followed the plot. The author has written some fairly decent books but this is not one of them. This book is evidence of formula writing at its worst. The plot is too ambitious with gratitious carnage - cumbersome transition - characters not well developed.
2,Disappointed,"Santa Fe Police Chief Kevin Kerney is on the hunt for a revenge killer while waiting for the birth of his child. Not everyone dies, but there is a lot of death. Within barely 100 pages, there were already three human deaths and two dead animals. By the end of the book, there were so many deaths past and present that I was immune to it. That's not really a good thing. The book dragged quite a bit. I frequently put it down and really felt no need to get back to it. The narrative seemed disjointed; there was just too much going on. The climax was very anti-climatic. It seemed more like an afterthought to the story. There was a lot of buildup, but not much pay-off. I do like the characters of Kevin Kerney and his wife Sara. There is good character development throughout the series. I have liked the Kevin Kearney series in the past and wanted to like this one, but this just was not as good as the others."
2,"Great book, terrible ending","I have read and enjoyed many books by this author. He clearly mailed this book in, and it was published without any input from his editor.The characters are well developed. There are tantalizing strains of social and emotional conflict begging to be developed! Excessive use of force by police who are dealing with violent mentally disturbed persons, with all sides well meaning and trying to do their best, is one. Complex relationships between married law enforcement agents, father/son law enforcement agents, is another.The plot is fascinating and complex.And then? An ending which pulls the rug out from under you and makes you wonder if this was just a half finished book rushed into production. All these 4 and 5 star reviews come as a shock to me, frankly I doubt they finished reading the book.Melvin Morse"
3,GIVE IT 3 1/2 STARS,"This is the first book I have read by this author and I was not impressed by his style of writing. With the first murder on page one to the last one in the next to lastchapter, there was not a lot ofsuspense. I could put the book down and pick it up 2 days later to read a couple more chapters.The most exciting part was when the baby was going to be born, if indeed the expectant mother was not killed first.The most touching pary was the sheriff meeting his first born son by an Indian woman. Finding this older son who was in law enforcement too, and establishinga new family seemed to outshine the murder victims left over the country side with a sign Everyone Dies or Youu Are Next on the body or near it.If you are looking forward to exciting descriptions of New Mexico's beautiful colors. look else where.There are other authors of this genre that provide far more exciting adventures."
5,goodtimes,"I found what I was looking for on Amazon. The product arrived shortly thereafter.Was glad it wasn't too long of a wait. Couldn't wait to put on the stereo and jammto Chante! The CD arrived in great condition, no scratches or fingerprints, first class product. Looking forward to ordering again!C"
1,Mind expanding psychedelia,"Do not let the title fool you,like it did me theres not really anything psychedelic about this compilation apart from the sleeve.If I had wanted garage music I would have purchased one of this labels other compilations.The only redeeming feature of this compilation is the informative notes inside and the sound reproduction."
3,The dimensions given are WRONG,"The dimensions of these chairs are 36x16x16.5, which is a bit on the small side. Other than that they seem sturdy and were easy to put together."
1,Not impressed,"I was very disappointed with this movie. After all of the raves I had heard about it, I was not impressed. I would not recommend this movie to anyone."
5,"All This....And Tap Dancing, Too","I could TRULY do without the cringe-inducing scene of the two black kids tap dancing. (What the hell was that about? Fifties sensibilities, I guess.) But otherwise this is a must see love story. One of the most sentimental and sweetest romantic films ever made. And it's all because of Grant and Kerr who are excellent. And oh! that scene when Nick finally realizes why she didn't meet him on top of the Empire State Building! (""I was looking up! It was the closest thing to heaven...."") Get out the hankies -- but PUL-LEZE fast forward right through the horrid tap dancing scene. (Talk aboout blackploitation!)"
3,SHAMELESS SCHMALTZ.,"The scene where Grant notices a painting in Kerr's apartment prior to Kerr's classic line: ""If you can paint, I can walk"" is alone worth the price of admission. Although I personally prefer LOVE AFFAIR with Boyer and Dunne (of which this glossy number is a re-make), this version has grander production values and it's filmed in decent colour. My only real pet peeve is Nesbitt's interpretation of Nicki's Grandmother; I simply don't think she's effectively convincing (look at the marvelous Maria Ouspenskaya in the original, and you may get my drift!)."
2,An affair to Remember,I love old movies and adore Cary Grant so I really wanted to like this movie. Cary Grant is charming and Deborah Kerr has class and grace but I found the movie to be bland. Cary and Deborah have no chemistry and you do not feel any passion between them.
5,a Great and Romanic film!,"""An Affair to Remember,"" is in my opinion one of the greatest romance films of all time. Deborah Kerr and Cary Grant make alovely and beautiful couple. The film is memorable and roomantic, as well as beautiful to watch. It's one of the best, and I highly recommend it. The scenery and storyline is great. It's a very entertaining film and one that makes you want to see it again and again. Truly enchanting and about True Love."
5,An Affair to Remember,"What is not to love. possibly the greatest love story ever filmed. I loved it as little girl, as a ""middle"" girl and forever as an adult. Such elegance, such class, such warm funny emotions. Any and all romances I have ever had have had to live up to this (unfortunately, most failed but ended OK when reality kicked in))"
5,So Lovely,"Love love love this movie! My grandmother put me on to black and white movies as well as these kind of ol' school movies. Every time I see one I know it's worth watching. Well! this one did not let me down. The piano love song is wonderful, the movie is modest and it's not unrealistically romantic like movies that are out these days. I tell you, give it a try!!! It's worth it."
5,AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER!,"If you have seen ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and have not checked out ""An Affair to Remember,"" all we can say is: WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU WAITING FOR? I heard CARY GRANT did not want to do this movie! It might show, but you still will be WEEPING at the end of this one! Cary is Nickie Ferrante, the international playboy who finds himself not only engaged, but attracted to Terry McKay, a woman he meets aboard ship! Terry is played by DEBORAH KERR (or, as some call her, DEBORAH KERR)! This is a VERY ROMANTIC film. Director LEO McCAREY makes the couple's first kiss very romantic--and you don't even get to see it! CATHLEEN NESBIT has the choice role of Grandmother Janou! There are even a bunch of CUTE KIDS! One of the great CHIC FLICKS of all-time! Get the TISSUES ready for the end of this one!"
5,"We all know it's great, but does anyone have the version...","I once saw An Affair to Remember end not with the tearful scene on the couch, but with Cary Grant carrying Deborah Kerr up the stairs of the grandmother's villa. ""Is she still paralyzed, or is he carrying her over the thresh-hold"" I asked. Didn't matter. One person I know saw that version. Anyone else? Anyone know where I can get a copy?"
1,Where's the magic? I somehow missed it...,"Supposedly this is one of the 5 most romantic movies of all time. You've got to be kidding! I suffered through this movie, and then said to myself, ""what a lot of cornball nonsense""! Did anyone notice that in the last scene, Deborah Kerr was being left for a couple of days by herself, a paraplegic, with her wheelchair in the next room? How was she going to manage that? Did they really fall in love on the ship? Could have fooled me. Some ""love affair"" to ""remember"". I think I'd have forgotten it the second I left the ship. Seemed to me like they spent most of the time trying to avoid each other. I just didn't see the ""chemistry"" between the two main characters."
1,Awful,"I don't criticize this movie for being sentimental. I watched it ~because~ I was in the mood for a sentimental, romantic film. And I mean old-fashioned, 1950s, simple and sentimental.This movie is a dog. Deborah Kerr is a dog! There is no magic. And then, 2/3 or the way through it turns to bathos. I turned if off while Deborah was leading her music class. Obviously, the star-crossed lovers had a reunion upcoming, but I did not care to see it.This film makes me think that maybe the cultural rebels of the 60s had a point...a notion that I do not readily concede."
1,Oh no! Not the St. Cliche Singing Cherubs!!!,"What an incredible waste this films turns out to be. Grant and Kerr give wonderful performances . . . until that incredible, amazingly awful third reel. And when they trot out the ivory-skinned, rosy-cheeked Singing Cherubs you'll have to use all your self-control to keep from laughing out loud, or losing your lunch, depending on your mood.There may be better examples of Really Bad Screenwriting out there, but it would be hard to find one that, somehow, met with such wide-eyed acceptance."
2,Total Melodrama in the Worst Sense,"I can't believe how many people love this movie and its predecessor, ""Love Affair."" To me they are nothing but unbelieveable melodramas in which one wishes she could pull the characters off the screen and give them each a few dummy slaps.Grant/Boyer is/are the worst--whiny, self-pitying, etc.Maybe I'm just not romantic. I wanted to give Rick a swift kick in ""Casablanca,"" too."
4,If wishes could come true...,"What a pity that Fox didn't make the original version ""Love Affair"" part of this anniversary package. Like director McCarey I prefer the original to this quite good remake. And while I have long been a fan of Cary Grant's acting abilities I have to say that I, again like director McCarey, prefer Charles Boyer to the great Grant."
3,a little slow,"I bought this after seeing it mentioned in Sleepless in Seattle. It was too slow, I lost interest quickly. I loved Sleepless, was surprised that this is so popular. I did like the ending,though."
5,excellent,Excellent old movie on new DVD format. Shipped quickly and arrived even quicker. Would purchase again from this source.
5,An Affair to Remember,What a wonderfully made movie. I don't know why I never saw it before. Such a classic. Wish they still made movies like that today. Not much left to the imagination anymore.
4,One of Holllywood's Best,The combination of Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr is magic. This is one of the true classics to come out of Hollywood.
4,What makes life so difficult? ...People.,"This 1957 film is a classic love story. It stars Cary Grant (Nicky Ferrante) and Deborah Kerr (Terry McKay). They meet on a cruise ship and fall in love. However, they are both committed to significant others. They try to avoid one another and ""play it cool"" in public, but to no avail. They were hopelessly in love. At the end of the cruise,they agreed if they still feel the same way about each other, they would meet 6 months later at the 102nd story of the Empire State Building and live happily ever after, but does it happen? You'll have to watch this enjoyable ""chick flick"" to find out. The plot was slightly slow and a little draggy in parts, so I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Overall a great film and an even greater addition to a Cary Grant film collection."
2,an affair to remember,"i think the newer version ""the love affair"" with Warren Beatty/Annette Benning better."
2,Over rated!,"After all I have heard and read about this movie, being so wonderful and one of the best romance movies of all time, I was so disappointed. I was embarrassed as I watched it with my family, because I kept assuring them how great it was going to be. Everyone thought it was lame, and we are huge romantic movie fans. And most of our favorite romance films are older than this one! The movie was ok, but it was too drawn out. And that scene at the grandma's house? Too long and too corny! I felt no chemistry between Grant and the Kerr, and everything was simply mediocre. And believe me, I'm a sucker for romance films. I don't understand the hype at all."
2,Yaawnnn,I have no idea why this video received 5 stars. It was just boring. The only good part about it was that Cary Grant was in it.
2,Where's Douglas Sirk When You Need Him?,"The film is schizophrenic - the first half is the more enjoyable one, featuring wry, smart, sharp repartee between the two very charismatic lead actors. The second half retreats into a sappy, spineless mush pit. It's hard to believe this made #5 on the AFI-Passions listing -- one might argue that any movie that hints of a romance should have made it, too, as a result.The two musical interludes featuring a singing Terry (Deborah Kerr) and kids were really unnecessary -- did she still think that she was Anna from 'The King And I?'This movie's achievement is that it is the ancestor of contemporary schmaltzy fare such as 'Sleepless In Seattle' and 'Serendipity.' If only the star-crossed predicaments were a little more believable, even within the realm of a romantic comedy."
4,ffair to Remember,This is an enjoyable movie for date night at home. A simple love story of love lost and found. The tearjerkers of the past seem to have the most impact.
5,STILL MAKES ME CRY!,An Affair To Remember (50th Anniversary Edition)This is still a real tear jerker and holds its own after all these years. I dare any man who watches this movie not to cry...keep the tissues handy. A great gift for someone you love!
5,An Affair To Remember,This is an excellent old classic film - that films of today just can't recreate with the same essence. A need to have in your library.
4,I Can't Explain It,"I've seen this movie a couple of times before. And I just accidentally turned on the last three minutes, and now I'm sitting on the couch, crying my eyes out. In three minutes! The intelligence and honesty of the characters, and that darn music, get me every time. Share it with someone you love!"
5,It is the best romantic movie of the 20th Century!,"In An Affair to Remember, Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr are a perfectly matched couple! Cary Grant with his charm and charisma, and Deborah Kerr with her beauty and sofistication, are enchanting. My favorite part is when they visit Janou in Villefranche. Janou is keenly aware of their mutual attraction. She decides to help the romance along by speaking to Terry and by choosing to play the title song. Very romantic! The scenery is breath-taking and the good-byes brilliantly done! The shipboard scenes also are beautifully done, as they provide stolen romantic moments as well as light-hearted comedy. The ending is a real tear-jerker, especially when Nicky sees the picture he painted. I never tire of watching the movie!"
2,I Don't Get It,"I'm a huge Cary Grant fan, but this movie is baffling to me. The first part is pretty good, but as soon as they hop off the boat in NY it goes bizarro. For the life of me, I can't understand why she would keep from finding him after the accident. If she really loved him, how could she stay away? Through that whole last part of this movie I kept asking my wife to explain it. If it pride it was pretty stupid. Oh, and let's not forget the singing! What were they thinking?? I don't get it! All those annoying singing segments.For me, even if you take out the singing and the crazy last part, there is still something missing. It's just a weak story that is saved only by the greatness of Cary Grant.I read it is a classic, but not for me. I do acknowledge some nice film work, including the stairway kissing scene, but those are few and far between for me to like this movie."
3,Uncomplete Spanish subtitles,"For those who require Spanish subtitles, I warn that the subtitles are not in line with the dialogues. The subtitles are loose and do not complete the idea of the English dialogue. Terrible translation."
1,unplayable British DVD,Zoverstocks sold me a UK version of this DVD which is unplayabloe and will not replace it with an amican version encoded for the US.
5,NEVER TO BE FORGOTTEN,"This movie is one of the best love stories ever written. It is simple in it's story line, but the Actors/Actresses are unlike the ones today. Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr are so wonderful as a couple. I cry every time I watch this movie."
4,"Quality ingredients, quality product","I started taking Source Naturals CoQ10 sub-lingual tablets, due to the quick absorption by the body and then switched to the soft-gels when they discontinued the sub-lingual tablets. If you don't take any other supplement, consider taking this one; CoQ10 is found in every cell in your body, scientists speculate it may be a cell building block and the high quality of Source Naturals is also important."
1,horrible customer service,"ordered 2 bottles but only received one. called so many times and always go to voice mailnever call back. wrote the email to sales department and through amazon.com, never heard from them"
4,A must have for professional program evaluators,This book is comprehensive and will provide you with Michael Pattons perspective on most major issues faced by evaluators. It is very easy to read and use.
2,Too much for beginners,"I'm taking an introduction to evaluation course for college, and this is the assigned textbook. It's too long. The examples are overwritten and cumbersome, and the book itself is jargon heavy with no glossary. Yes, it's easy to understand in the main, but try summing up the author's points at the end of the (50+ page) chapter. There is an entire chapter dedicated to different kinds of evaluations, which is probably of little use for most readers. For those who want an in-depth book that covers every single possibility, this book is excellent. For an introductory course, not so much."
2,too old edition,Maybee I was in a hurry doing my purchase. But when I got the book I was dsiappointed. It was the edition of 1978. Too old. Trashbag next.
2,How very disappointing!,"I have been an avid reader of the Black Lace series for several years now, and I was so disappointed with this book. I literally had to force myself to continue reading this book. Normally I am completely engrossed in the books, but this one just didn't hold my attention. The love scenes were rather tepid. Although I believe in making up my own mind as far as reviews go, trust me, don't bother with this book, or at least don't pay full price for it."
1,"too exagerrated, not worth the time","When I am not stripping, I enjoy reading books, but this was not one of them. This author is supposed to specialize in lapdancing, table dancing, topless only, or peep shows, to reveal the startling lives of exotic dancers, well, as a dancer, I find this book very exagerated. This is far from the truth and alot of the content in this book is probably from the fantasy world of the author."
1,not stripped to the bone...,"should be shot in the head.... Out of the norn for Black Lace series of books this is the story of a weak woman sleeping with men that are decidedly loosers.Annie was seraching for herself in this book and compiling a diary of rules to live by. I was always hoping she'd find herself and get it over with, but, to my dismay she finally finds what she was looking for and that was 'nothing'.Sorry the book was disjointed and to say I could never get into it is about the best thing I could say ..."
1,What was Black Lace thinking?,"I am an erotica fan - I've read tons of erotica: magazines, literature, compilations, etc, but this is among the worst I've read. The sex scenes are not especially steamy, and there are too few, also - the author's attempt at turning her erotica into a work of literature was lost in the process. The author is obviously a well read woman, but - couldn't naturally make her characters appear to be so (as I believe she had attempted to do). There is more to be critical about - but readers (especially neophytes to erotica) should know that Black Lace publishes many good works of erotica, this volume is not among them."
5,A MUST BUY!!!,"Fantasy themed metal at it's finest. Enchanting vocals and outstanding music. The bands music is inspired by the works of J. R. R. Tolkien (for those who have been in a hole these past few years, he was the man who created Lord of the Rings). I truly reccomend this along with their previous CD, ""Where the Shadows Lie."")Check out their website - www.battlelore.net"
1,Buyer Beware -- item description NOT ACCURATE,"I received the edition listed above -- orange cover paperback, ISBN-13: 978-1407647159 -- only to discover that it is NOT the Greek edition and it has NO commentary whatsoever. It appears to be a hard copy of a public domain English translation, but I can't tell off hand which one it is because there is no translator credited. In fact there is no bibliographic info at all -- just HardPress Publishing. Not even a date. I found this edition by searching on K.J. Dover, so if you've arrived here the same way, be aware that this is NOT the Dover commentary on the Greek."
3,Entertaining,"My friend and I were doing a project for school on the internet and we stumbled across the whole text of this play (we were reasearching ancient Greece). We decided to bookmark it, and then during lunches we read through it until we finished it. It's very amusisng, I highly recommend it! I love the songs!"
5,A MYSTERY THAT CHILDREN WILL LEARN FROM ... and enjoy!,"When Samantha's father disappears after a tragic family accident, our heroine doesn't see or hear from him for ten years, except for one postcard picturing a monkey from the San Diego Zoo. With this single clue, the search for the truth and for her father begins ... and she can finally heal from the emotional trauma.A good, simple mystery that kids can relate to ... and learn from.Highly recommended."
5,Great Book(Husky Student),I really liked Do You Know the Monkey Man. I think it was very catchy and once you get into the first chapter it pulls you in. I like how Samantha is very determained to find her dad and then find her sister Sarah or T.J. I also like how the author would give lots of details about how her sister was never found and how much she didn't want her mom to be remarried.
4,REViEW!,"I do love this book. Right in the first chapter it says something that makes you keep reading until the end! It is very realistic, but also crazy. I deffiantly would reccomend it to those teen readers, particualry girls. (It doesnt really talk about monkeys... just a little quirk in the book, someones nick name is the monkey man)."
4,Dated but useful audio upgrade handbook,"This compilation of Audio Amateur articles offers a good deal of helpful information to would-be upgraders of stereo equipment. The specific boxes dealt with here are now mostly either obscure and hard to find or, in the case of the Marantz 7C, too valuable as a collectible to modify (most are now in Japan now at any rate.) However the principles shown here are still very relevant to modifiers or homebuilders of stereo equipment.My only complaint is with the quality of many of the photographs in this book, which are quite poor. I still have the original articles from TAA and in them , the photos were substantially better. Should OCSL reprint this title I would urge them to reshoot these pages or add photo plates.This book is still very much in print as of the date of my review, incidentally."
5,First Class,"This CD features the music known as Reggaeton, a combination of Reggae and Salsa. Reggaeton was all the rage on my last visit to Panama.I don't pretend to know much about Reggaeton, but this CD is sensational. A serious mover for the uptempo dance music lovers, I would call it a ""must have""."
3,eeehhh it's o.k......,"The install went pretty easy. I like that it charges my Ipod. What I don't like (and this really drives me nuts) you can't access playlists or artists or any of the menu options. You have to start playing your ipod, and then use the controls on your head unit to switch songs. The downside is, if you have lets say 800 songs on your ipod and you first felt like shuffling through randomly and then you hear an artist that you want to hear more of, you have to disconnect the Ipod switch to the artist and play the album you want to listen to. It may sound like a small complaint in print, but I gaurantee it will drive you crazy if you have any sizable song list and ADD."
1,Warning: NOT COMPATIBLE with 5G (video) iPods!!!,"I purchased this cable to use with aPanasonic MXE CQ-C7203U CD player with MP3/WMA playbackhead unit and a new ipod. Imagine my surprise that the newest iPods aren't supported! Older ipods connect just fine, but when you attach a 5G nothing happens at all. This fact is not shown on any website, and I had to go through two levels of Panasonic tech support before I could even get a straight answer from them.The cable itself is plenty long enough and very sturdy - if you have a 3G or 4G ipod, I'm sure its a great buy. Unfortunately, if you're planning to buy a new ipod, or you already have a 5G ipod video, you don't have a panasonic head unit in your future."
4,car audio is fun,"this is a great item works how it's described.however the only drawback is that it does not charge your i pod,that is a little frustrating.but it does work great."
5,Just some great music.,Judith's Durham's voice has the beauty and clarity of a silver bell rung on a quiet night at the South Pole. I had forgotten just what a great folk/pop group the Seekers were until I ran across this CD on Amazon. Their five big hits are on this album as well as a lot of other songs I had never heard before but are quite enjoyable. You can't go wrong with this one.
5,THE VERY BEST OF THE SEEKERS,"Great music. Actually I had no idea that ""The Seekers"" was an Australian group. This was the music my parents listened to when I was growing up here in Kenya. In those days (the seventies) we listened to records playing on a gramophone! For years, every time I met with my siblings, we would hum the tunes and try to remember some of the words to the songs. Our favourites are A World of Our Own, Georgy Girl and When the Good Apples Fall. Finally I got tired of imagining what it used to sound like and got my own copy from Amazon. Thank goodness for Amazon, shopping is so painless and I can actually get stuff that nobody bothers to stock in Kenya!To my amusement, my 19 year old daughter has fallen in love with several of the tracks. The younger kids love Emerald City. Truly this music is timeless. I bet my grand children (when they come along) will enjoy listening to my CD years from now."
5,Prepared,"My daughter has left the roost and like most Dads I worry about her safety. After reading the glowing review from Don Rearic.com and the info from Doug Ritters Equipped to Survive website, I bought this to include in the survival kit I've made for her car. Added a small folding blade knife, a surplus ECW sleeping bag, 3 days worth of emergency water packets and survival rations, an emergency 120 hour candle/matches and a small bucket of kitty litter. I feel much better knowing she has the basics in case she gets stranded in her car here in North Dakota"
3,"bag didn't reseal, defective","I wonder how widespread this is since many people might not open this until they really need it? In my case I thought I was getting a steal since I was in the market for a new dry bag to augment an existing survival kit. The bag however was broken, there were no snaps on the other side of the bag for the zip lock style enclosure to lock together. The kit itself however is in good shape, all the components are quality. I'll probably end up using a waterproof cell phone case for my own ""pocket survival pak""."
3,Compass doesn't seem to work,"I originally gave the product three stars b/c of the faulty compass. After trying the other items, I would give the package four stars.Compass doesn't seem to work. When I turn the entire kit in different directions, the compass needle either doesn't move or it points in the wrong direction. I may ask the company to replace it.The firestarter generates a substantial spark. Other reviews of the firestarter claim it takes a many attempts to generate a spark; my unit generated a spark immediately. I like the one-handed design. I can hold tinder in a high-wind situation with one hand, and generate a spark with my other hand. Also, if one hand is bruised, the tool only requires one hand.It is easy to put the contents back into the sturdy bag.The directions provide clear advice.The white cord is supposedly for fishing. I'm surprised the unit does not include some fishing line. I guess fish are not bothered by a white cord if there's a worm on the hook."
2,Compass doesn't work,The compass does not seem to work. I didn't open the plastic case. I just turned the case in a few different directions and the compass would not point correctly.
1,Whoever remastered this should be enslaved,"Okay, we know that the original movie soundtrack wasn't the greatest to begin with (Jack Nicholson singing leaves a very bad taste in your brain) but it had a few memorable tracks: Prologue 1945, Christmas, See Me-Feel Me/Listening to You, and the Acid Queen. So, one would think that with a remastered soundtrack the engineer(s) would make those, and the other tracks, shine.Wrong.The remastered album is dreadful, _especially_ Prologue 1945: it's brash, noisy musical mayhem--it sounds like The Three Stooges tripping and falling their way through an orchestra pit/recording studio...and that's just the beginning. I'm so disappointed with the disc I just may stick in the microwave just to feel good about its self-destruction as it generates a miniature lightning storm and melts into a puddle of muddled musical goo.Save yourself some money and disappointment: buy the DVD and rip it to .mp3 files, instead."
3,I got it for one song,"Okay, I'll admit it, I had the LP back in the day and really don't care all that much for most of it, but I upgraded to a CD of it anyway just for one song. I love the film version of ""Sparks"" so much I couldn't help myself. What a trip!"
3,"A touch excessive, but...","I admit, having non-singers singing on this soundtrack is a bit much - no casual Who fan will buy this - but I think a few of the songs (well, two come to mind) rerecorded by the Who sound better than on the original, such as ""I'm free"" and ""We're not gonna take it."" Elton John and Tina Turner are also added pluses. Still, I don't know if I would buy this thing, just for a few songs."
2,Really bad!,"I agree with everyone who said that the assembled cast of singers had no business on this recording! The original rock opera ""Tommy"" was, is, and ever shall be the difinitive version. I don't know what Ken Russell was thinking having the likes of Jack Nicholson and Oliver Reed crooning, and thus ruining, some of Pete Townshend's most brilliant tunes! Tina Turner is the one saving grace on the whole piece, aside from the parts sung by the members of The Who themselves (""I'm Free"", ""Amazing Journey"", ""Sally Simpson""). Overall a real disappointment of both a film and a soundtrack with amazing potential!"
2,Even little Tommy would dislike this.,"Save your cash and spend it on the Who's original version. Without the visuals from the film, this version leaves too much to be desired.Almost a ""Who's who"" of people who have absolutely no business singing in the same state as any recording equipment. Ann-Margaret? She is fine writhing around on a pillow covered with baked beans (those who saw the movie know of what I speak), but PLEASE! She sings almost as bad as she looks good. Oliver Reed is not much better. The worst of all is Jack Nicholson, who sings just as one would imagine he could (which is not worth a damn).Elton John, Slow Hands Clapton and Tina Turner cannot resurrect this disaster. Not worth half the price."
2,A Portrait of Over-indulgence,"This recording is full of folks who either couldn't sing (Jack Nicholson, Robert Powell, Barry Winch, Keith Moon and Oliver Reed) or shouldn't be singing this material (Ann-Margret). The few shining moments come from Elton John, Tina Tuner, Eric Clapton and - of course - the Who. The only reason to buy this CD is to hear the absolutely best recorded version of Amazing Journey - bar none!"
5,Interesting read.,"Arrived quick, and in great shape. Interesting book, and I've passed it on to others. No complaints about this company!"
5,great book,I read this in Hebrew and loved it. It is a great story that is well told in a non-conventional manner. I haven't read this in English but have read other translations by Halkin and he does a good job.
3,Better for historians,This book is interesting if a reader wants to know more about the beginnings of the state of Israel. The reader needs to study a chart of the characters and who is related to whom in order to follow the story. It is well written but hard to follow.
2,Not what I was looking for.,"Could not wait to get this book. Upon receiving it, had to force myself, by thinking ""No other books until this one is finished"". I still could not get to the end and it is a short book compaired to most I usually read."
3,M Gears,"I got this for my 6 year old grandson for Christmas. He is very good at building things, but the parts on this are hard to put together. It takes some force to snap the pieces together. There are lots of things to make and hopefully as he gets older, he will be able to use it. I think the age should probably be for 8 and older. Otherwise it's a great toy."
3,Good music DVD but not as good as veggie tales live.,Good DVD but veggie tales live I would recommend first. It is nice though because it has the words on the screen so you can learn them to sing with your child.
5,We love it.,Watch this with my 4 year old all the time and she absolutely loves it!! Brings the cd we have in the car to life.
4,"The Very First VeggieTales Workout Vid-I mean, Sing-Along Video!","I like this one a lot because you can sing-along to your favorite VeggieTales friends! It also fetures the New & Improved Bunny Song along with the first appearance of Everybody's favorite Pirate Veggetables who don't do anything!But the BEST thing about this one, is that Larry doesn't even figure out that it is Sing-Along video until the end! He origanaly thinks it is for Work-Out, and then for Home-Improvement, and THEN He thinks it is for real-estate (he bought a WHOLE chocolate factory with no money down!)The only thing I can say is not pleasing with this one, is that Bob says ""Sing-Along TAPE""...even though I have the DVD...he he he..."
4,Love Veggie Tales,"Funny stuff. My 95 yo Mom loves watching these when there is nothing else on TV, which there very rarely is these days."
5,Great DVD,I bought this for my toddler. It is cute and the songs are catchy. It holds his attention for the full half hour. I would recommend it to anyone.
3,Lake Waco,"This movie is based on the true crime The Lake Waco Murders which took place on July 13th 1982 in Waco Texas. Alot of the facts are changed and it only mildly resembles what really took place. The acting is good and this is not a bad true crime movie. If anyone wants to really know what happened i recommend the book ""Careless Whispers"" by Carlton Stowers "" this is an excelent account of what really took place."
2,"One good, one so-so","One of the two brake drums I ordered was okay, but the other one was highly contaminated with metal shavings from manufacturing, requiring significant extra work to clean. Apparently quality control is lacking. Both measured to specs. & work fine."
2,"Some good, some not as good","While the first half of the disc is great traditional Clancy Bros. the second half (with some others from their families) left a bit to be desired. The second half of the CD seems to also be a bit poorer quality than the first. If you're into a full collection of their music this may be for you. Collectors should beware, this is the same CD as ""The Best of The Clancy Brothers & Tommy Makem""; however the latter is at a higher price."
1,WORST knife EVER!!!,"DO NOT BUY THESE KNIVES. Wow, I was really disappointed with this knife. Such POOR quality. Brand new and it can't even cut a tomato with force! It's already rusting, and shows rusted spots even though I dried it after washing. Some foods like squash or cucumbers leave strange streaks on the knife that you can not scrub off, no matter how much elbow grease you use. Steel Wool won't remove it, even scraping it with a fingernail will not remove it. I love RR which is why I thought the knife might be something good, but I can't believe she put her name on this or endorses it! I hope my warnings will keep anyone else from making the mistake of purchasing this knife or any of the knives like it. I wish I could get my money back! I'm not usually one to buy something because of the name attached to it and I'll probably not buy anything else with RR's name on it."
2,not so great...,The first time using this knife was great. Nice grip and good size knife. It cut through a tomato with ease. After it was handwashed and used the next few times I saw that it no longer cut with ease. The blade is starting to rust and it already needs to be re-sharpened (blade almost looks pitted).I would return it but I really don't want to be bothered with that. And the packaging is long gone.Does Rachael Ray really use this thing??
1,Very disappointed...,"Do not purchase this knife. My husband bought this for me for Christmas. After the second hand washing, the knife was rusted - spots all over both sides of the knife. I still have cheap knives from my college days (1993) that haven't rusted. Very disappointed, I expected more..."
2,"Stainless Steel? Pssh, Old Rusty I say","Its sharp, but after two washes it's rusting all over. Looking for the manufacturer's website but what do you know, there isn't one. Amazon willing to replace??"
5,I'm in love!,I ordered this knife half because I needed a good knife and half because I love Rachel Ray. Anyway...the knife is fabulous! It slices through everything with very little effort from me. I started out with the 5 inch because I have small hands...but I'm definitely looking to purchasing the 7 inch next. The silicon handle is awesome. Great gripping power and sits easily in my hand. I recommend it to anyone looking for a knife that's not only comfortable to handle but cuts like a dream!
4,Makes you hungry for pizza!,Great tool for learning several different fractions and you'll be wanting to order pizza when your done b/c of great pics. Solid construction.
4,Nothing special,"I had to buy this from the Internet because I needed them for a school costume in June when sweatpants weren't in the stores. They came in timely fashion. They did shrink with the 1st wash. Not worth buying with the cost of shipping, unless you have no other choice like I did."
4,Some really good songs but need better production on Vocals.,"All I can really say is if you like bands like Sentenced, HIM, Poisonblack, Charon, For My Pain, etc. This album is a nice little treat. The only problem I have with it is the production on the vocals suck, but the vocalist is still good. Stand out tracks are ""Fragile Hollow"", ""I Don't Believe in Love"" and ""Disgusting"". Really is a good buy, but after hearing it you'll want to hear progression on the next album; because you know that they'll get far better, the potential is there to be a really awesome band. I give this album a 7/10."
2,Extremely brief discussion of many topics,"This book is well written and easy to read but is much too basic. The book covers a variety of topics, but none of them in enough detail to be of assistance as a textbook in any but the most rudimentary of courses. For example, many of the major topics in healthcare decision support are discussed in less than one page."
1,How about a few visual aids,The chapter entitled Graphics-Based HDSSs uses only verbal descriptions of graph types. It is ironic that a chapter that discusses the value of different types of graphs to facilitate cognition in different types of tasks imposes the extraordinary burden of making the reader visualize those paradigms unaided and making the reader hope that he correctly understands them.
2,"Not the original, as it SHOULD be.","I agree with others who complain that this isn't the original song line-up from the original album. That's an insult to the buying public to play such games. I can see adding bonus cuts, but certainly NOT removing songs. Fortunately, I have the hilarious ""Intergalactic Laxative"" from elsewhere. Shame on what appears to be deception."
1,Why is this album a masquerade?,"This is not the original Cosmic Wheels album that came out in the early seventies. Gone are the quirky songs like 'Intergalactic Laxative' and 'What the lonely call the blues' and in their places are a load of songs that you can get on any Donovan greatest hits compilation. Sadly an A&R man somewhere has destroyed what was possibly one of the artists' best, but least known records. I can only call it a crime against popular music."
2,Disappointed,What a disappointment..I wanted the original Cosmic Wheels album with classics such as Intergalactic Laxative...Anyone know where I can get it?
1,How I wish I`d Read the reviews first!,"Well, this obviously wasn`t the Cosmic Wheels I know and love.Just some sort of live `Greatest Hits` effort. Waited for the postman with bated breath and was sooo disappointed. I won`t be returning it because the postage from UK to USA will probably be more than I paid for it. That will teach me not to accept things at face value."
3,"Live album, not the original..","As stated in another review, this is not the original ""Cosmic Wheels"" album. This is ""The Classics Live"" repackaged, and missing some of the songs on that album. Worth listening to, but don't bother if you've already got ""The Classics Live""."
1,not the right one,oh dear when is the original going to be released on cd i have just got open road and now need cosmic wheels and my life will be complete and i can die a happy man.
1,Very Disappointed,We were ordering a collection and was very specific and finding each video online to match the selection. It pictured this cover but when delivered it was an older cover and DOES NOT MATCH our set. Very irritated that you showed one cover and shipped another. We won't rely on this source again.
5,Great New Repackaging of Best Show In History of TV,"I must say that CBS has outdone themself with the new packaging of ""I Love Lucy"" seasons 1-9. I love the artwork. I will certainly buy all seasons along with the Official Sixth and Final Season of ""The Lucy Show."""
5,A poignant story of a Hero remembered by his little brother,"""Leo, My Big Brother"" (A World War II Story,in which the author brings a loving tribute to his big brother)Leo was a WWII hero. He flew off to war and never came home. He had the same dreams and aspirations as all American young men of that era as he bravely went off to fight for his country. He left a young war bride behind as well as a loving family. His life as a youngster, growing up in rural Western Maryland, brings back memories to those of us who lived there and shared those memories. We relive those happy times through the eyes of Dr. Kisamore (the ""litttle brother""), and we remember with loving pride and gratitude those young heroes who eventually gave us back a peaceful world."
4,Great Phone,A good phone but the display and camera resolution are regular.... BTW good MP3 phone...
5,Still flying high,"Bought this from Amazon a year ago(June 05) and installed it with 160 lb of readymix. The halyard shipped with it was for a shorter pole, but cutomer service replaced it quickly. Highly recommend this for the normal residential installation. Flag is taken down during stormy weather (our two FL hurricaines) It has proved an asset to our landscape, allowing us to demonstrate patriotism and school spirit (Go Gators)."
2,maybe they should have stayed forgotten?,"It's true that van Beuren studios made animation history with some of these short features. There are some astonishingly sophisticated anime effects, great colouring, and so forth, in many of the shorts. They belong on any serious collector's shelf. But...... for this viewer anyway, the repeated doses of nasty racism really spoiled the experience. Some of these toons should have been excerpted in van Peebles' great documentary ""Classified X"" -- as indicators of the spirit of their times, they are pretty darn depressing.While I'm NOT in favour of bowdlerizing or other attempts to alter history, I think it's weird that the jacket reviewers make no mention, apologetic or otherwise, of this offensive content. If these toons offended me, a white viewer, what would their impact be on, say, a Black parent who got them for the kids to watch? Sheesh. At least the public deserves a prominent note of warning on the box."
3,Rema a spoiled brat?,"In this chapter of the pony pals, Snow White's real owner, Rema, comes home from boarding school. Lulu immediately takes a dislike to the girl, convincing her friends that Rema is a snob. Rema wonders why such a rude little girl is allowed to lease Snow White. Since Rema is to big for Snow White, Lulu and her posse convince her to sell Snow White to Lulu, who doesn't deserve to own such a sweet pony."
1,The stupidest book ever,"This book is so stupid, they want a girl to give up her pony just because Rema is too big for it. What if one day Lulu grows out of her pony, does she have to give her up? NO! Also, they hate Rema just because she didn't like Snow White's drool and she called a pony a horse once."
5,Friendship,"This is a really great book. It shows the bond between a pony and her owner. I would feel terrible if I had to give back Melody, whom I am leasing...maybe I can talk her owners into selling her just like Lulu does...anyway, this is a good book and you'll love it even if you can't relate to it!"
4,Brief thoughts on Crime and Punishment,A look at murder through the eyes of a killer. A fascinating incite although naturally some of the writers ideas are a little dated the storyline keeps the reader interested.
5,Seminal,"An absolute must read for people who want to see the fascinating process by which ancient scripts are deciphered. Also points out that to begin to understand the classical world, one must begin with the bronze age. I only wish someone would do a reprint of this book with actual linear B characters in the text itself, rather than numbers"
3,Noch weiter...,"If anyone, like the reviewer below, would like actually to LEARN some Linear B, the easiest way (short of going to Cambridge or UT Austin) is to get the excellent bookLinear B: An Introduction, by J.T. Hooker, which has recently been republished (though you should be well at home with classical and Homeric Greek before you start on Mycenaean). Good luck!"
3,Should be better,"There is a fascinating story here dying to get out, but Chadwick can't seem to get a handle on it. The biography of Ventris, the details of Minoan civilization and the theoretical aspects of deciphering dead languages are covered in a manner which piqued my curiousity, but ultimately left it unsatisfied. In the hands of a marginally better science writer or historian this could easily be a five star book, because the subject is naturally compelling."
5,Thank you!,"I've been looking for this crochet book for years and was so excited to find it! The item came in perfect condition and was delivered in the time frame stated. The only downside is I though the s/h was a little steep; however I obviously was willing to pay it. Overall, Thank you!"
5,A 'must read' for those interested in cults.,"This book is a wonderful read. It is a fascinating chronicle of how a closed community, founded on religious principles, slowly goes off the rails as its members fall under the spell of extremist ideas."
1,Not As Pictured!,"I purchased 5 of these to sell on another website where they were selling for about $53.00 each. BUT when I got them, they weren't the ones pictured. They were plain white, no logo, no design, nothing. Though that sounds like a silly complaint, I was only able to sell these plain toasters for $15-18 a piece rather than the $53 toasters pictured. The ones I received were also shaped differently, they were rounded at the ends, sat lower to the counter, and had a different button than the ones pictured."
1,Hotdog toaster,Well honestly I am not please. I guess I can not expect much for the toaster ones but the roll one I got my father quite working and am going to send it back.
3,Hot Dog Toaster,"This was a gift to my grandson because he LOVES hot dogs. The only complaint is the ""stop"" button broke after the first use. It fell into the toaster and they were not able to retrieve it. Otherwise, it seems to cook the hot dogs and buns just as he likes them."
4,Hot Dog Toaster,"This is a great item to have around for a quick snack. It's easy for kids to use, and is no hassle or mess. My nephew had one for years, but we were only recently able to find this one. The kids were thrilled when ""Santa"" left it at Christmas. It does cook the hot dogs and toast the buns. It's a fun little novelty.Hot Dog Toaster"
2,Hot Dog Toaster,"The concept is a great one. But this toaster doesn't heat the hot dog to high enough temperature, even at the highest setting. You have to run the hot dogs through two heat cycles to do that. But if you don't take out the buns after the first cycle, the buns are burned. Great concept, terrible delivery. I'd go with one of the ""roller"" style hotdog gadgets out there. This will definitely be a garage sale item."
1,Reconsider,"I would suggest you not buy this product. It is really of very poor quality. In fact, ours didn't work and we had to return it. We opted for this product because it was cheaper than some of the other hot dog cookers. Well, the expression..""you get what you pay for"" surely applies for this product."
3,Not big enough..,"With todays larger sizes of hot dogs available, it only handles the smaller dogs. Which I don't eat anymore, would be great if I had kids, but I do not, so I have no need for this product."
1,burns the buns easily and seems to be cheaply made.,"I'm a little disappointed. Even with the variable heating time, it tends to partially burn the buns."
4,Great for the money- change strings if sound is an issue,"I bought this for the price- I had it restrung with better strings and had the bridge altered, which made the instrument sound much better. If you have any string/sound issues I recommend having a professional take a look at it- cost was minimal and since the violin was so reasonably priced to begin with, it worked out."
1,very very cheaply made,"tried tuning the violin and it wont stay in tune, and then the string snapped when tuning correctly. not happy with this purchase. i guess you get what you paid for considering the price. highly suggest paying a little more money for a beginners violin"
1,Do NOT buy this violin!!,This is NOT a good deal at all!The bow is a piece of junk along with the bridge and the strings!The finger board is not attached well and will pop off!I am so sad I actually bought this based on the great reviews!PSEven the case is cheap >:II paid $75 dollars 7/10.
1,TOTAL piece of crap.,"the string broke within seconds of me touching the thing, the tuning knobs were flimsy. I don't know anything about violins (I bought this because I wanted to learn) but I know bad quality when I see it."
2,Beautiful... But won't stay tuned to save it's life.,"I love everything about this violin... except that I can't really play it because it won't stay in tune. Whenever I turn the knobs to tune it the knobs (either immediately or gradually) turn back to where they were. I actually broke a string trying to get the thing to stay put. I'm hoping that I can find some sort of solution to this other than buying a whole new violin. Other than that, it looks pretty, sounds pretty (momentarily), the case is nice and everything was as described."
3,Book quality,"The service from this vendor was 5-star excellent, but the illustration printing was inferior quality and I returned the book."
4,"You've heard the famous words,now see them artistically!","""I have the original edition of this book which provides Aldridge's vision and other artists interpretations of the Beatle's lyrics. These images are contemporary to the songs, so expect psychedelia, surrealism and the stuff of which dreams were made in the 1960s.Newer editions have omitted Aldridge's vision of what the Beatles would look like when they turned 64. Because Lennon and Harrison didn't make that age, I gather they felt it was politically incorrect. It's too bad, I remember staring at the picture as a teenager, not being able to imagine my heroes as old men. I was half right - :-( """
3,I may not know art - but I know what I like,"This book was a disappointment to me personally. I did not like most of the art. There is a lot of nudity and I find most of the illustrations have absolutley nothing to do with the songs. I don't see why ""Strawberry Fields"" needs to be illustrated by a photo of 2 completely naked children. The lyrics are in small type and seem trivial compared with the graphics. To me - it was more that the lyrics were an afterthought and the art work was most important. Also - there ware a lot of solo work by John Lennon included - but equal attention was not given to the other 3 Beatles for their solo efforts. If you are into freaky 60's art and completely gratuitous nudity - then you will probably like this book. But - it's not for every Beatle fan. Oh - and BTW - the person who wrote that ""Two of Us"" was about Paul's relationship with John and not about Paul & Linda - read Anthology or ""Many Years From Now"". That song IS about Paul & Linda."
5,AMAZING!,"This book is utterly inspiring. The music of the Beatles is legendary, and the way the artists re-create the songs into art is visionary and fascinating. Plus, it's not bad having the lyrics handy, too. A must-have for all Beatlemaniacs!"
5,my neck loves it,"I'm in college and spend hours in the Library pouring over textbooks - it's SOOOOOO nice to not have to look down at the table - my neck is SOOOOOOO relieved!!! found it's not so good for smaller books, but tackles big books with EEEAAASSSSEEE!!!!!"
5,like watching a 3.2million dollar troma movie,"this was absolutelly amazing. I bought this with out knowing what this was or if it was good. The story is amazing the gore is awesome for the time, the acting is amazing, and lots of big explosions. But one of my favorite things is the soundtrack, its filled with lots of electronic synth, helps pull off the futuristic 1995 aspect. this reminds me if lloyd kaufman made a 3 million dollar 70's movie any troma fan would love or peter jackson fan."
3,"Low budget, escapist action B-flick for concept fans","Steve Railsback stars in this quirky sci-fi chase flick. It's reminiscent of more recent ""mortal combat"" style movies where several different characters square off against each other in battles to the death. The nefarious villains hunt the defenseless ""fugatives"" with high-tech and/or unique weapons of choice that fit their personalities. When I was a kid I played this very ""game"" with several of my G.I.Joe action figures. G.I. Joe in fatigues (Railsback and crew) vs.assorted action figures costumed in tin-foil and clay (pretty much like the baddies in this movie). There's the sinister hunter, the cyborg, the wookie/werewolf, and the evil temptress. In fact, I think the writer/director played the same game as a child. It is violent and stereotypical of this genre, but I thoroughly enjoyed watching!"
2,Blech!,"Lots of artificial flavors--the fruit, the fake sugar--overall, just...yuck. The kids and adults are having a hard time getting these down. Maybe if you're used to flintstones or other commercial vitamins, these would be okay. We were taking naturally-flavored Solaray previously, and these are truly wretched by comparison. I was lured in by price. Not again.Vitamin-wise, I guess these are okay, but light on mineral content. Also note that these do not have iron."
1,to Derek M.A. Alexander,"In response to Derek M.A. Alexander, while you and other reviewers made good points about Ashanti's work reflecting her younger and current age, the samples I read were poor, and I have taken into account that she wrote them when she was younger. This has nothing to do with her literary or educational level or even or maturity. Frankly, I've written better poems when I was younger, and I write better poems now. [...]"
2,HMMM,I LIKE THAT SHE IS EXPLORING ALL OF HER OPTIONS AND SHE SEEMS TO BE HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION...
1,Foolish/Unfoolish : Reflections on Love,If you see this book or audio cd in stores RUUUUUUN it stinks oh my god I read the book first and it was boring so I was like I'm going to hear her read the book since she wrote it I thought she was going to put personality into it but she failed If they had a rating that was 0 or -1 then she'll deserves that
2,Too teenage,"I bought this book because I am a poet and a hip hop efficianado and was dissapointed by it. I give Ashanti some credit because her writing style is nice, but these poems completely lacked depth. I am in middle school and most of them reminded me of those frivilous relationships of my peers that last for five days. Please don't write anymore books, Ashanti"
1,BAD,This was the worst book I ever bought. I can hardly call this poetry. Please don't waste your money!! Do yourself a favor and buy a real poetry book!
2,"""You always seem to make me feel"" that this book is a raw deal.","Ashanti wrote these poems when she was a teenager, so I guess the sophomoric content is understandable, but are these works worthy of being published? Here is a quote: ""When I look into your eyes I still get butterflies / I know this love will grow that's why I'm letting you know / Baby, you always seem to make me feel that this love is real"" (SEEM to?). Then it goes into an analysis of the relationship that inspired this love she seemed to be made to feel. Little poems on teen loves is nice to read if you are the person who wrote them and want to go down memory lane (and laugh), but it is not worth publishing in a book. Ashanti can sing, act, dance, and model, but writing doesn't seem to be her thing."
1,throw this in the trash,"this is a terrible, terrible book. it's so bad that it's funny and i bought it to laugh at. ashanti is an ok singer but a TERRIBLE writer. go waste your money on something else, like a dog house made of pinecones than this load of crap."
1,This was complete garbage.,"This book was the worst thing I have ever read in my life. Ashanti is a horrible singer to begin with and now I find out how terrible of a writer she is. As a poet myself, I was deeply upset by this book's contents. Ashanti needs to promise the world that she will never dabble in writing again."
5,very pretty and comfortable,I had a pair of earrings like these but much lighter. These are nice size but still lightweight. I like the look of them very much. I do not wear heavy earrings since I have seen what they do to earlobes after years of use. I like the 'endless' hoop since it seems safer to wear around small children-if they pull on one it's more likely to open rather than tear the earlobe.
5,Wonderful group,"This was definately an underrated group that made some incrediable music. If you are a fan of old school industrial, buy this album.."
3,a big kick in the junk,"This ins't engine by any means. Feel lucky that its hard to find this, and feel unlucky that Die Warzau haven't relased a follow up to the perfection known as ""engine"". Idustrial/electronica best kept secret. Engine was masterppice of emotions wraped around machines, but was over looked for easier to sell bands such as stabbing westward and Gravity kills. Even though engine should have been the perfect album for fans of ""the downward spiral"". They just have to much creativty and artistic diveresity for the taste of america. I got this album in the hopes that it would be of the same calibur. Oh well."
1,"Good idea but not well done, sorry!",I have never read an astronomical book that contains so much duplicated information. Many facts appear several times in different places in the book for reasons that are far from clear. Tighter editing might have reduced the page count by 10 or 15% without lowering the value of the book.
4,Cool Flick,"With what's on TV these days, you gotta consider this one to be kid friendly. Steve McQueen plays a great role in this flick, and even if it is historically inaccurate in some respects it has to be counted among the great war movies of all time. Well acted and well directed."
5,Classic Movie,"Classic War movie starring Steve McQueen, James Garner and Charles Bronsen... Directed by the same person who did the Magnificent Seven.If you like action, suspense, and not a lot of Holleywoodisms's, this movie is for you... Filmed in Germany to increase authenticity..."
3,One star to far.,"They made a movie called a bridge to far, about a military objective that was just to far behind the lines for the mission to be successful... one bridge to far. This movie was one movie star to many.This was a hughly hyped movie in its day with a hugh cast of stars and a big budget. But when they started to write the script so that all the stars had their shining moments the director found it impossible to trim the fat without going to war with one high priced talent or another. The result for me was a movie that was at least 30 percent longer than it needed to be and still be entertaining.I know I see a lot of 5 star reviews here, and there were truly a lot of 5 star moments. There were also to many 1 star moments and this averaged out to 3 stars for me, rounding up for the cool Steve McQ motorcycle chase."
5,One of the greats,This film is truly one of the greats. Steve McQueen was a role model for me early on when I saw this film for the first time at the age of seven. I think maybe I have seen this film ten or twelve times and I never get tired of it. Widescreen is the only way to go! See the film the way it was MEANT to be seen.
5,A Classic WWII Movie,"This movie is full of stars who use nothing but great acting to show what went into the greatest escape attempt by any group in WWII. It is a bit long, but it is worth it."
1,NOT based on the true story.,"Impossible to rate, as it is a very entertaining movie, but is NOT based on the book. It is a hollywood hype of a true story, reduced to a pathetic star vehicle for a hot actor (of the time) on a motorcycle... There was no 'cooler king' in the book, no motorcycle, and it was largely a commonwealth do.... Very few yanks involved in it. A sad and dishonest treatment of an utterly incredible story.If you want an entertaining movie, this is a good one. If you want the true story, buy the book."
2,Worth a Remake...,"The movie has too many modern day problems...back in the early film-making days they could get away with alot of situations in war movies that are far removed from what we know to be true. Its a Hogans Heroes approach to comedy and light-hearted nature in a WW-II POW camp...far from realistic. The politics inside the camp play out on an unbelievable level.Steve McQueen's early days are captured, and his gritty performance is a notable standout among a star studded cast.Want a POW movie...get ""Bridge On The River Kwai"" instead."
2,lovable ww2 adventure,"Plenty of famous actors, I liked Bronson in this one. McQueen drew a laugh with his macho act and baseball glove.Biggest problem in this film was that it had the balls to say it actually happened in real life. This preposterous claim is made right at the title as the film starts. Other than that, grab a six-pack and settle in for three hrs of crazy stuff, almost like an extended sitcom."
1,Not a good transfer picture,"I bought this DVD for my widescreen tv and was expecting it to be a decent picture and it was the first DVD I had to return because the picture was absolutly horrible. It was as good as any VHS tape I've seen and I wouldn't suggest those who have bigger screen tv's to get this DVD untill MGM decides to transfer it right.Even with a proscan DVD player it had terrible contrast lines and wasn't even imroved when trying to adjust. The ""very long"" letterbox format on this one makes the black bars on the top and bottom over power the entire screen. Believe me, there are many DVD Trtansfers in letterbox that are done capturing the entire 2:35:1 letterbox format correctly and MGM should be ashamed of themselves for releasing such a horrible transfer of a great classic movie.I will awaite untill they re-do this one and suggest those with big tv's to pass on this one even if you feel you must have it in your collection. It is a shame."
4,the great escape is great,"The Great Escape is a long movie, almost three hours. It concerns a planned escape of 250 men from a German POW camp. The movie does sit a little on the campy side, and doesn't show the horrors of war or the pow camp, but it is entertaining to watch. This isn't anyone's strongest movie. James Coburn's part is weak. McQueen's acting borders comic at time. But it is a decent movie to watch. The dvd contains a 24 minute behind the scenes featurette. It's a good featurette. Instead of recapping the movie, like so many others have done, it does go into the making of, and is really well done."
4,The Real Deal,One of the first war accounts that stuck very close to actual history. Steve McQueen's character is not expanded or glamorized just because he was the most idealized American hero. The famous motorcycle chase is actually rather short. The 3 British officers (and Germans) have fairly distinctive personalities. My only gripe is that it desperately needed 10 minutes edited out for pacing.
5,What a great movie,"I just saw this movie on DVD, and it was great. Possibly one of the best war movies made with an all star cast, Steve McQueen just shines thru almost a level above the rest, get this movie you'll love it !"
3,Great film but a horrible DVD,"This is one of my favorite old films. I can watch it again and again without getting bored of it. Unfortunately, this DVD is sub-par. I was okay with the graininess of the picture. It annoyed me though, when the left quarter of the picture goes a bit greenish and over-saturated during the last half of the film. The audio is to be expected but I believe it could be redone as well.If you already own this on VHS, don't run out and get the DVD quite yet. I'd wait until it was redone and re-released."
3,Why are MGM DVD's so bad?,"The movie itself would get 5 stars, but I subtract 2 stars for yet another lazy, no-effort DVD publication on the part of MGM. While widescreen, it is recorded on the DVD in letterbox, rather than anamorphic, format. What makes this especially bad is the usual, 2.70:1 aspect ratio of this movie. By recording in letterbox, that means half of the scan lines on the DVD are used to record nothing but black, empty space. The result looks terrible on a widescreen TV; the low resolution is very apparent.While other studios seem to make an effort to re-master and produce high quality DVD's, for the most part MGM just seems to be recycling their Laserdisc masters with no additional effort put into the DVD itself. 'a real shame, considering their catalog has alot of great classics, such as this one."
5,A classic,"One of the greatest war films of all time! Watched it with my kids, just like my parents watched it with me."
5,A Classic,"I bought this for my son, age 20 for Christmas. He's loved this movie since we first watched it together when he was in high school. Cast of characters if second to none. Great action. Great music. Captures the imagination. Wish they made 'em like this still today."
3,"Good, but The Book is Better!","This is one of my all-time favoties movies, but if you have not read the book by Paul Brickhill, you need to. The real story is absolutely amazing and cannnot compare."
5,A Classic WW2 Movie That Defined a Genre,"I've read the Brickhill book which formed the basis of this film. It was an excellent book but the film itself really captured the amazing spirit of the Allies in this world conflict. John Sturges does an amazing job in terms of the character development, pacing, action and more. This is an essential World War II film for any moviegoer and especially for a WW2 junkie. This movie defined the Prison escape film.The ensemble cast with the engimatic McQueen, the stalwart James Garner and the steady of Richard Attenborough was amazing. In addition, the great character represented by Charles Bronson, James Coburn and Gordon Jackson round out one of the most memorable films in film history."
2,Does not do justice to the true story.,This movie was a travesty. Its focus was too much on humor and the fictional motorcycle antics. Find a copy of the book -- one of the great non-fiction books ever -- and skip this movie.
1,WASTE OF TIME!,"For being one of the most popular movies of its kind, it really was a big waste of time. I never new a Steve McQueen movie could be so overrated until I saw this. I had never seen the movie until last week, and boy was I dissapointed. All these years of hearing and reading all the hype, for nothing. I admit I was convinced it was good even before I saw it, again, I was wrong. It is not that thrilling or suspensfull. I know it was based on the true story, and I admire the real POWs for everything they endured, but this movie does them a disservice by trying to make it funny at times. Not admirable. Don't waste your money, just rent it if you want to see it. Forgetable after its over and done with."
1,VERY BAD DELIVERY SERVICE,"I have ordered 2 DVDs on August 9, 2007 and today is September 11th 2007 but yet I have no clue about my DVDs. This is pathetic and very shameful thing for a name like AMAZON. I ask everyone not to buy anything before they commit you fast delivery.I HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY DVDs YET."
5,Great Escape,"""Great Escape""...Great price...Great service...Great all around.This is what all online purchases should be."
3,A decent WWII POW movie,"The Great Escape was a decent movie. However, it did not live upto my expectations.The storyline was fine, action was decent and suitable and characters played their parts well. The movie also detailed the escape plot well and went into considerable depth.One part of the movie that reduced it's quality was the unnecessary comic relief throughout the movie. Almost from the start, many POW's act like they are on vacation and not a prison camp. I don't think real-life POWs would have acted like that. In the same vein, the German officers appeared fools and clowns, who not only tolerated much insolence but didn't seem to have a clue at all."
3,Should have waited for the Blu ray,"Classic movie, but the DVD picture quality just isn't there in this copy. It's like watching a 60's movie on a 1960's television. Good news is the Blu Ray comes out in 2013."
4,good but kind of long,this movie was very good but i was stupid and didn't read how long it was figuring it was only 2 hours long therefore i made myself late for class and got yelled at but thats my fault this is a good movie and its based on true events it did lead to other dumb moments on my friends and mine part especially when my friend tried to ride a broken back down a snow sloped hill while emulating steve mcqueen's motorcycle scene don't try to do any of that motorcycle stuff my friend sprained his arm
5,"GREAT ACTOR, GREAT MOVIE, OVERALL GREAT","ONE OF THE BEST IF NOT THE BEST WAR MOVIE OF ALL TIME, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN THE ONLY ONE JUST AS GOOD THOUGH THEY WERE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MOVIE. OFTEN IT HAS ITS FUNNY MOMENTS BUT THEN TURNS UPSETING TOWARD THE END. IF YOU HAVE THREE HOURS FREE I SUGGEST TO SIT DOWN AND TURN ON THE GREAT ESCAPE. IT GETS BETTER EVERY TIME YOU SEE. AN EASY FIVE STAR RATING."
4,Both funny and suspenseful,"""The Great Escape"" gives a dramatized version of a true WWII prison camp escape tale. The Allied prisoners are played as resilient, innovative escape artists cast against the unfriendly oppressive Germans. I say ""unfriendly"" because the film doesn't really show the Germans as evil, only as unkind. They are extremely restrained in their treatment of the prisoners, especially those who attempt to escape over and over again. For me, this really detracted from the believability of the story, even though I knew that the basic facts were true.Regardless of the characterization shortcomings, the movie really delivers a feeling of suspense about the fate of the prisoners. Who will escape? Who will be captured? Will the German response suddenly turn ugly? You're really captivated by the action on screen.A great classic of WWII films."
5,Why not now?,"While the review title is strange, I will explain. This movie has been around for a long time. I saw it in it's first run the night before entering the military. It was good then and it is still good. In fact it is one of the best war film and best films ever made. How did the actors, producers and directors ever make a movie without all the blood, gore, overboard violence, reprehensible language and stupid animation that is so prolific in what they call entertainment today.Great actors (far better than anyone on screen now), great storyline and as I stated previously, one of the best films of all time."
4,Great classic war movie.,I gave the movie 4 stars as there are a bunch of great actors and it was very interesting you should enjoy it also.
5,Classic,"This is a CLASSIC! There are several stars in this film. The best part it's based on a true story. This is a true Classic war type movie, if you like Kelly's Hero's or Dirty Dozen you will enjoy this film."
5,Great Atlas,I wanted map detail and a spiral bound book. I will eliminate the Travel Guide section as it adds too much weight and isn't needed. Very pleased with the purchase.
1,"Great movies, unfortunately not widescreen","Very disappointed to find these two films have been reformated to fit ""your TV!"" Not my TV! If you like ""full-screen"" versions, you will be well pleased. If you collect widescreen videos, don't buy this package!"
1,Soooo bad,"This book is probably the worst textbook I've used in my college career. Not only is the layout extraordinarily simple and uninteresting, but the writing is a pain to read. I found this text very stuffy and repetitive, with many sentences based on formulaic constructions as, ""Implicit in our discussion of 'x', we shall introduce topic 'y,'"" and ""'x' delineates 'y.'""As for the content, it seemed to me to be a presentation of many theories without any supporting evidence. The authors present many psychoanalytic-like theories using hypothetical examples, but few real world examples. If you have to use this book, good luck, if not, there are much, much better texts on family psych."
5,Great book,This book is so helpful. It is clear and concise and does a great job of breaking down the family systems.
1,DO NOT ORDER,DO NOT ORDER!!! do not buy from this seller...you item will not be shipped. Had to cancel order and go through a headache with customer service because of this seller.
3,Wedding night,"Bought these for my wedding night. Looked great. Like other reviews, they are not durable. They are typical nylons. Except for the look."
2,Cute but they FAIL!,"These stalkings are ADORABLE, but I am all about cute and efficient. These are not that. I bought them for my wedding and the elastic that held them up was super flaccid. It would not hold them up, I had one that was up because of my guarder and one that was at my ankle. Cute but they FAIL!"
4,Excellent buy,"I haven'nt bought a remanufactured electronics product before, so I was a bit sceptical. But I am amazed at the crisp quality of this product. For the price, I took a chance and so far (3 weeks), I haven't had any problems. The player looks elegant with easy user interface. Product appeared to be factory sealed with a 90-day warranty."
1,doesn't work,"Didn't work right out of the box. So, I asked for a refund. I was leery about buying refurbished and was correct."
5,"Like the movie, only better","We had watched the DVD of ""The Other Side of Heaven"" many times and really enjoyed it. Finally we decided to see what the book says. We were not disappointed. It is filled with insight and wonderful stories. The movie is pretty close to the book, but there is so much more in the book."
5,I absolutely loved it! I highly recommend it to anyone!,"This was a wonderful book! In this autobiographical story, Elder Groberg shares his experiences as an LDS missionary in the 1960s in the small islands of Tonga. There are lots of exciting near-death adventures and amazing miracles and other interesting page-turning stories that made it hard for me to put the book down. But more than that was the story of a boy who, through determination and help from his father in heaven, learns to love the gospel and the people with all his heart and grows to be a man. This book is a must have for every personal library."
3,interesting story,"I bought this book because I am intrigued by the Tongan people. It is certainly an amazing and courageous story, and I admire the author for his work and faith. I would have given this book five stars, if the author had kept his interpretation of the message to himself. I feel there is so much more that could be learned from the book, if we had been given the freedom to listen and think on our own."
3,A Not So Complete History,"This book does cover the history from the start, but it lacks the details to call itself ""The Complete Story"". I don't know if it's been updated (I believe mine is a first printing) but it only covers to the mid 90'sFalls short of being a good coffee table book due to size (small) and limited amount of photos. And, it falls short of being a good reference book due to limited technical information, organization, and completeness.This book is acceptable overall, but I'd like to find a large format book with color photos of every model, and thorough technical and historical information."
3,A mixed bag,"After hearing some of Light of Euphoria's music online for a year or so, I finally decided to check out one of their albums. I decided to get Krieg Gegen Die Maschinen because I just love the song ""True Life"". I have to admit I was hoping that the rest of the album would be in the vein of ""True Life"". It was not. The music starts off on a more synthpop sound then finishes off with a more aggrotech sound like on the last 2-3 tracks. I do though really love the song ""Nothing At All"" with its infectious pop hooks and bouncy dance beats. I do like the track ""Consequence (Face Yourself)"" featuring Ronan Harris of VNV Nation. I really wanted to like the rest of the album but to be honest, I couldn't. I found the remaining songs uninteresting and not so memorable."
4,Good...But!,"This is a good book but it was not as comprehensive as I was thinking it would be. Most of my Die-Cast cars were not listed in the book. It does give a good over view, though, so I enjoyed it!"
2,not what I thought!,"I had cervical fusion @ C5-C6 w/a plate, also shoulder surgery.I still have lots of problems & thought this would be a nice comfort at times, but it folds in half & clumps up around your neck. Nothing like the hard collar (which is awful, but efficent."
2,Not so hot after all,"This item might have been okay, but it did not fit my boyfriend. He has bad degenerative neck disease and I thought this would help keeping his neck warm. I should have been wary of the one size fits all aspect of this product. The true problem is that I attempted to contact the company in the manner and within the time frame that they wished for to be able to return this AND never got a response back. Anybody want to have it for free? It is of zero use to us.Maria"
5,Steel Magnolias Soundtrack,Excellent! One of my all time favorite movies - now I can listen and play it over in my mind.
4,Wrong series,This book is the 8th book in the Raj Whitehall Series a.k.a. The General Series. It has nothing to do with the Belisarius Series Universe. So please don't get the 2 mixed :-)Shadow
2,Just not that good,"I love the premis for this series, and I really like the authors, but this particular book just wasn't very good. The storyline shifted away from the main character so much that he couldn't even be considered the main character any longer. The ""Raj/Center"" characters, which are the basis for everything in this series hardly even make an appearance. The story was very predictable as were the little events that were used to fill pages."
1,Not Impressed,"David Drake is perhaps my favorite author. Having said this, it truly pains me to see anything this bad bear his name. The General series that is the basis for this book, is a masterpiece of military sci-fi. The Reformer, the first book in this pair, is pretty good as well.This book on the other hand is crap. Unmitigated, inexcusable crap. Eric Flint managed suck any life the new characters had out of them while at the same time destroying the essences of the old favorites, Raj and Center.While this may bear the caption (book 8) of the series it truly doesn't belong. Flint is most deffinatly not Stirling. Read this book if you need proof. As a better suggestion however, I'd say skip it all together and re-read 1-6 because simply put; I found nothing redeaming about this book."
2,Collaborative sci-fi gone awry,"Eric Flint and David Drake's ""The Tyrant"" is an interesting concept. The book takes a stab at portraying the fall of the Roman Empire. But instead of Rome, the scene is the distant planet of Hafardine, and instead of Caesar and Brutus, the cast include Verice Demansk, a lunky bloke with a flair for the officious, and his network of friends, family and foul-smelling enemies. I don't mean to belittle the plot. My main problem with this book is that it's sci-fi by committee. The characters are introduced and forgotten as quickly as last year's reality show. And the stilted language of our heroes - by the gods! - is enough to give anyone a punishing headache. Perhaps ""The Tyrant"" would have been less tyrannical had the book been about 200 pages shorter. But the authors, despite their heroic efforts, deliver just a little too much of a good thing."
4,Worked perfectly on a Toyota Echo,"I was impressed that the fit was as accurate as it turned out to be. Be advised that the mount is cast to fit different vehicles, so it's quite important to CAREFULLY follow the installation instructions. Installing entails cutting off certain appendages to the mount that are unnecessary for specific installations. If you mistakenly cut the wrong tab, ear, or other appendage off, you've destroyed the piece for your purpose. Fits and looks great if installed carefully, though."
1,Will NOT accommodate 1 double DIN unit in 2000- Toyota Celica,I write this review to share with potential buyers a bit of false advertising on the part of the vendor. This item will NOT accommodate 1 Double DIN unit of Toyota Celica model year 2000 and up.
3,Good Concept...Mediocre Execution,"Almodovar is often bold, raw, and unpredictable, but ""Matador"" is probably my least favorite besides the horrid ""The Skin I Live In."" His theme is another variation of sexual passion and violence that co-exists in certain Spanish people. 1980's fashion and tv cliches are everywhere, but it does manage to create a certain erotic dangerous mood."
5,"One of Almodovar's ""classics""","This is one of his best movies - hope to see it available again, on DVD this time around!"
2,"It is not about lullabies,","I am Armenian. I love Armenian music. I like my two kids to have some Armenian musical experience, so I bought this CD for night time.Rather than Lullabies, a kind of music you expect to be smooth and to express kind well mood, this cd music express deep sorrow and grief through the music and Hasmik's entonation of the songs.We must remember we are genocide survivors, but it doesn't mean that we have to express grief in every artistic expression.So, buy this CD for the music, but don't buy this CD for the lullabies at all."
4,Good book!,"I like this book, but i still found another material to supplement some detail it doesn't cover and those are what I need."
4,Sarah Loves This Book,"I bought all four of these books for my 18-month old daughter and they were well worth it for her. She sits on the floor and just turn the pages, flips the flaps and says ooooh, baby, ball and other little words. If your child enjoys the Elmo's World series on Sesame Street, they will love these books."
3,its okay,"My son is 16 months old. The flaps in this book are a little big, and there aren't enough of them for his taste. I think this book might be more appealing to younger childern. Also, I wished there were more photos of real babies under the flaps, and not of puppets."
4,Get it right please,"Ozzy Osbourne was NEVER in this band. The bassist for this band was named Mike ""Oz"" Osborne; hence the confusion. Whoever wrote this editorial is a moron."
2,Not up to snuff,"My wife and I are New Mexicans, Christmas music devotees, and love the Romero Brothers.Nonetheless, we pan this new album--badly. It's just not up to snuff: Get Chrisdtams in Santa Fe or Christmas at the Mission instead.The ""innovative"" portions in this collection are technically OK, but show no addition to the Christmas standard. Worst is the Nutcracker on flamenco guitar: truly egregious.Give this one a pass"
5,Good Classic Stories.,"Haven't read these for years. Was very good. Realized that some of the stories are too ""grim"" for younger grandkids."
2,No true color sample,"After reading several other reviews telling to stick with natural colors, I bought the ""Pale"". It looks white on me. It was not as creamy or moist as I was led to believe. On the bright side, it is a good lip liner and lipstick all in one; if you find a good color for yourself. The color did stay on for several hours."
1,7 Months Later -- and Quite Forgotten...,"It is now just over 7 months since I first read Thackeray's appallingly poor ""The History of Henry Esmond."" Though it has been nearly 2 YEARS since I last read ""Vanity Fair,"" I still retain a reasonably good working knowledge of that novel; sadly -- or, perhaps, not so sadly after all -- that does not hold true for ""Esmond."" So poorly conceived, so poorly executed, and so very slight, this novel ultimately makes no real claim on your memory. I simply CAN'T remember anything about this wretched book other than its remarkable level of wretchedness. To some -- and you know who you are -- it may seem as if I am engaged in some kind of vendetta against this book and Thackeray in general. To those persons, I can only respond with an Everlasting Yea! Go forth and read Mrs. Gaskell -- a writer who actually wrote novels worth reading (except for ""Ruth,"" which is inexplicably awful). Yes. Go do that."
4,Remakes,"Mostly I want to comment on all the negative comments surrounding Pearl Jam's remake of ""The Last Kiss."" What good is a remake if it doesn't make some substantive change from the original, e.g. Bonnie Raitt's version of ""Runaway"" versus Del Shannon's. Frankie & the Cavaliers definitely capture the time & style of the pre-Vietnam U.S.A., much the same way Eddie Vedder & Pearl Jam capture the style & angst of an entirely different generation. What version I would play would depend on what kind of mood I was in. BOTH ARE GREAT!"
2,Of the three versions,"I still prefer J. Frank Wilson & Cavaliers' original. Although most people my age remember the 45 being released on the JOSIE label, the best version is on the green TAMARA label. It was recorded with tons of reverb which is great for a song of this genre.You may also want to check out the 1973 version by Wednesday that charted."
4,I think the Pearl Jam version is far better than the first!!,"The first time I actually listened to the words of the song, I was blown away. That song is so sad. My parents said the J. Wilson version is better, but I disagree."
1,PEARL JAM'S is much better. Good tune though.,good song in general. Pearl Jam really rocks it though
2,"better than pearl jam, but not much","This is better than the pearl jam version, but it's a pretty bad song even so. I don't know why anyone would want to do a remake of it, but if they do, they could at least try to make it a little better."
1,Maybe Worth A Dollar At A Garage Sale,"Last Kiss was a memorable tear-jerker from the mid sixties. After listening to this CD, I can understand why J. Frank Wilson was a one hit wonder. The other songs on this CD are trash. Sound quality is poor. All songs are in mono and sound as though they were recorded in a garage. There is a photo in the CD pamphlet that shows the building where Last Kiss was recorded. This photo pretty much explains the sound quality."
5,Arthurian Legend Lover's Must Read,"Of all of the recent novels I have read concerning King Arthur, this series has been the most entertaining. Jack Whyte has found some wonderful explanations for some of the legends surrounding King Arthur, Merlin, and Camelot. Mr. Whyte has made the residents of Camelot into real people with real concerns. I would recommend the entire series for anyone who enjoys the world of King Arthur."
5,extravagent,"The Book, The Singing Sword, was the tale of life before King Arthur. This novel told of the fall of Rome and the hardships that the world had to live with. With the sword Excalibur being made, troubles come with the greatness of it. Jack Whyte is an incredible storyteller and this book is one of the best I have ever read."
2,S...L...O...W Going,"The fist novel in the series was quite good. This one, the second, is bloated and slow going, with little action and page after page of windy, tedious, and oftentimes wholly unnecessary dialogue. Characters telling each other---in stilted, monologue fashion---what they're going to do followed by the author then describing in detail that very thing being done, which is redundant, unnecessary, and irritating enough early on, and over the course of this 300-plus page novel, infuriating. One hopes that the rest of the novels in the series will be better."
2,A disappointing book,"I'm afraid that I will have to go against the other reviewers of this novel and say that I wasn't greatly impressed. I found it pretty slow moving with weak and unconvincing characters and it was a definite struggle to finish. It would have to rate as just about the least interesting ""Arthur"" story that I have ever read.I was also irritated by the historical inaccuracies. Some examples: the battle of Adrianople took place in 378AD and not 376AD, the macedonian phalanx was an infantry formation, not a cavalry one, the Roman short sword was a gladius, not a gladium.Having said all this, I will probably read at least one more of this series but this is no longer a high priority."
2,What a Joke,"Nice idea but the story, characters, and how they interact are unbelieveably ridiculous. Some of their conversations will have you laughing out loud although that is not Whyte's intention. Whyte can write well enough to just barely hold the strings of a story together."
4,Excellent Begining,"The Singing Sword is a really excellent beginning to a 9 volume saga of historic fiction (merging with mythology) which attempts to set the Arthur legend into what we can realistically know about Britain starting in the 5th century of the common era.The author has done his homework; there is great verisimiltude in the details of how the Roman legions (where we start) were organized and how they operated in the far reaches of the Empire. He obviously has closely studied much of the historical record regarding how the fall of the Empire impacted the complex nature of the polity in Britain at the time.But like good historical fiction, he interplays his research and narrative with interesting characters, each of whom have a political outlook which seems to represent major factions of the time.It's fast-paced, compelling, and a page turner. Before I was half-way through, I had ordered the sequal."
2,Don't bother,"The Singing Sword is a valiant but misinformed attempt to place the Arthurian legend within the transitional period as the Roman Empire withdraws from northern and western Europe. One of the biggest disappointments is the essential premise of the book: ""we need a sword for use from horse back."" The protagonist spends an entire volume ""inventing"" something the Roman cavalry alae had been using for centuries. Just as the Roman infantry had adopted the short gladius or ""spanish"" sword during the conquest of Spain. The ""spatha"" or long sword, adopted from the Gauls, had been adopted as a standard cavalry weapon by Rome long before. So the protagonist had but to ask his Celt friends for a sword to model his upon. Rosemary Suttcliffe's Sword At Sunset recognized the probable origin of Arthur's sword in the Roman spatha over 20 years ago"
3,Sex and violence in Somerset,"The second volume of a an interesting series putting the Camelot myth in a real historical setting. Maybe a little slower than the first volume and has rather more explicit sex; which may be a consideration if you are thinking of giving this series to a young person. Lots of action and almost too graphic detail of battles - heads cleaved open, brains spilling out and blood everywhere. But the historical detail is great, the characters well drawn, the weaving of myth and reality is masterful. A good read for those who like their action graphic and a smattering of sex to keep up their interest in the slow sections."
1,Could be great?,This program could be great if you could get a hold of someone at technical support to help you. Downloaded the program and none of the stamp images appeared. Have tried unistalling and re-installing at least 7 times. Product manual is not helpful and hardly has any information on installing or trouble shooting.
1,A rip off,I bought their 2009 software and then bought the 2011 update. When it failed to load I emailed them with the details. After two weeks of emailing and getting no reply I threatened their third party seller. They kept sending me the same software that wouldn't install. I finally went to PayPal and got my money back. Now the original software doesn't work and won't load on my new computer. Forget support. There is none. I tossed it in the garbage. Buyer beware!!!
4,stampmanage 2011,I installed this o windows 7 and seems to work just fine. Since this i my first stamp collecting software I find it easy to use and have had no problems.
5,Excellent,"The software came as I expected, when I expected and how I expected it. I am totally satisfied and would buy again from this seller."
5,pay for quality - it's worth it!,"I've owned a Leverpull for over 5 years now and probably opened more than 250 bottles with it. It's reliable and easy to use. Some friends have ""imitation"" versions that sometimes have trouble extracting the cork.I've purchased a replacement coil just in case, but have not needed to replace it yet.I'd always recommend quality over price - especially in wine products and new products."
5,Wow... very impressive and readable! Could have been written yesterday.,"When I received this book, I was amazed. As I said in my title above, it could have been written yesterday. This author writes clearly, concisely and brilliantly about the complexities of the the interior life of women including their relationship to their various life roles i.e. friend, lover, marriage partner, etc.This book offers an in-depth and insightful model of feminine psychology. It is particulary good at explaining anima and animus dynamics and would be a great read for men trying to understand different types of women. It will also serve as an excellent model for a woman doing her own inner work.I work in the psychology field and I'm very picky about books in this genre. I have absolutely no reservations about giving this book my highest recommendation."
2,An opinon to beat to death,"I am familiar with much of the content of the book having been part of the newest ""York Gang"" and knowing most of the newer characters. Although it is great to have a history of our sport, the author continually qualifies any positive aspects of Bob Hoffman with ""He did it for his ego alone."" There are enough inaccuracies that I am sure of that I have to question the accuracy of the entire text. One of the characters cited as an accurate historical reference is known to be an exaggerator of far greater proportions then Bob Hoffman ever was. Lastly one of the much much quoted references was run out of York for theft."
4,Hoffman was crystal-clear to me as a kid,"A good book, and it seems solid in its accuracy.I can say that, being a bodybuilder for 25 years and a youth in the 70's when I would buy Strength and Health Magazine, that it was crystal clear that Hoffman had no care for bodybuilding. I was not smitten with his bodybuilding 'writings', and can say that his supplements were garbage which we could barely ingest without vomitting.It is true that one had to demonstarte athletic prowess along with bodybuilding development to even compete in Hoffman's shows, and then you were posing at about 2 a.m., after the weightlifting events had been completed. Hoffman did much to hold bodybuilding back, and he is only thought of in reverence by those who perhaps live in York."
2,Who cares????,Does anybody really care what the York Dumbell outfit did to exploit weightlifting or that Bobby Boy Puffman was just looking for a tax writeoff for his incredibly successful oil burner business?I find this book boring and totally irrelevant. Recommend Dick Tylers West Coast Bodybuilding Scene instead of this one.
4,Worth your time.,"I've been a fan of the episodes that were online and now I get to see it on dvd. The transfer was not the best, but you don't loose much on the dvd. I thought there could have been more special features on the dvd, but that's not way I got it. Well, this from a fan's perspective and might not be the best one to base you decision on, but I still recommend it for those who have not had the chance to see it online."
5,Great Story,I've seen the original web series and this is a little better since I can watch it on my T.V. instead of my computer screen and it comes with commentary from the creator on each individual episode. The only real problem I can think of is that the music has been changed from what the the web series had and in my opinion the music in the web series was much better but the new music is serviceable.
2,horror film that could have been better,"A young girl Olivia witnesses her prostitute mother get murdered by a client. Years later she becomes a bored housewife marked by the past. Another man Robert Walker Jr. enters the picture but her double life catches up with her. The movie's fine until the second half when it decides to add in a ""Vertigo"" like element and falters because of it. Suzanna Love and Robert Walker Jr. give good performances. Even with its problems it still is an improvement over Ulli Lommel's previous Boogeyman."
2,Authors do not know the computer industry,"The authors are PH.D. economists, but obviously do not know how the computer industry works. I've been in the industry over 40 years and had to deal with the IBM and Microsoft monopolies. Much of the text deals with dead issues like Beta vs. VCR and QWERTY vs. Dvorak keyboards. If you are interested in these topics, the material is complete.The rest of the book is a defense of Microsoft and tells us that Microsoft is a success because of the quality of their software. They do not mention the hundreds of bug fixes and security patches Microsoft sends out regularly. Most people in the computer business will laugh at some of the statements in this book."
5,Best book on the subject.,"A great book. Must reading for anyone interested in the economics and politics of high technology markets. Explodes a number of myths. Eg. If Microsoft software dominates the PC market because they control the Windows operating system why are Excel and Word the number one products in the Macintosh market? Liebowitz and Margolis dug up hundreds of software reviews to provide evidence for their views. By the way, as was pointed out in the review of the book in the WSJ, Liebowitz and Margolis are academic economists who have been studying and writing about this issue for almost 10 years - long before the Microsoft anti-trust trial started. The book is about a lot more than Microsoft in anycase."
1,tent light,This is a piece of crap. for starters it's not really a tent light but a battery operated screw on the wall type light. It was just packaged in a bubble wrap and sold as a tent light to hit a different group. It has no string hole in the back which it should have as a true tent light. it does work but only provides dim diffused light. it might be good enough for marginal use in a tent but not for me. I actually bought it for a closet at home and it's OK for that. Not very bright though.
3,Double-sided discs not great,"A great package of episodes, but a couple of sides have stopped playing, even in my computer, which ususally will read discs otherwise unplayable in my DVD player. I've occationally had similar difficulties with other double-sided disc sets (Leave It To Beaver), and they have no visible damage. I wish these vendors would knock off this budget move. Other series like That Girl and Donna Reed seem to be much better products - single-sided.The Best of Mister Ed - Volume One"
3,The Best Episode is Missing,"I was all excited to get volumes 1 & 2 as a gift. Imagine my disapointment when my favorite episode ""Leo Durocher Meets Mister Ed"" is not included in the ""best of""!!! Nothing beats Ed ""working out"" with the Dodgers (Herman Munster trying out for them a few years later is also very funny)."
5,A 60s Treasure,"One of the better shows of the 60s, Alan Young and the gifted trainer of that horse made this work. Excellent supporting castincluding Connie Hines and neighbors (Larry Keating and Edna Skinner in the earlier episodes) and Leon Ames and Florence MacMichael in the later ones.Ed is a horse who is as stubborn as a mule with some hilarious situations. Very good use of guest stars such as Clint Eastwood, Zsa Zsa Gabor and George Burns in this set, and the amazing MaeWest in the 2nd volume.This should just be seen and enjoyed. A keeper from the golden age of TV!"
5,Praise for Volume 1-Mr. Ed,"I never really realized how much I missed seeing this extremely funny show. This, in my opinion, was one of the best comedies ever presented for pure enjoyment."
5,Great for a Mister Ed Lover,"If you like/love Mister Ed, you won't be disappointed when you don't experience difficulty with the DVDs.This DVD is NOT for a child to handle as it is double-sided. Please read the review from Kirland. I totally agree with this person.I still love watching the approximately 10 episodes that I can view at this time. Thanks."
5,GOOD OLD FASHIONED FUN!!,this dvd is so funny seeing all the old episodes of mr. ed and the predicaments he gets himself and wilbur into. it was my favorite show as a child and it is so good to see them again! i am so glad they came out with this dvd and i heartily recommend it for fun and laughs.
5,Durable and efficient,"I originally had the plastic type of heated buckets with the element separated from water in the bucket by a layer of plastic (made by Allied Precision) but these have all failed the test of time and have been discarded because the plastic interior of the bucket cracked and the water leaked.I replaced them with 2 of these heated rubber buckets from Farm Innovators and they have been working perfectly for the past 4 winters. The plastic guards which snap over the heating element have come loose and been lost over the years but the horses don't seem to mind amd we have not had any burns or broken elements. I do make sure that the buckets are plugged into a GFI outlet.I recently bought another heated rubber bucket through Amazon and it works just as well as the old ones. The price was very competitive, especially when I factored in what I would have paid for shipping elsewhere. Highly recommended!!"
1,Bleueboy,I am very disappointed with this heated water bucket why? I plugged it in and it did not work. I used another outlet and it still did not work. Needless to say the water froze while I was at work and my dog went without water most of the day. I had thrown the box and invoice in the trash which means I cannot send it back for a refund...waste of hard earned money. Suggest Farm Innovators test product before shipping.
4,What a great collection!,"I must confess that I'm a very big fan of Cat Stevens. This collection satisfied me completely. The only thing I miss about this collection is one or two of my favorite songs (Rubylove, Two fine people) but all in all, I'm extremely happy I got hold of this collection."
4,Well Worthwhile,"This is worth it just for the song ""If You Want to Sing Out"" from the cult film Harold and Maude, that is almost impossible to find anywhere else. I've wanted that song for years."
3,Drummer Boy marching to the civil war,"This story is about a boy who joined the army because Abraham Lincoln asked him to so he can bring spirit to the solders. So he did and became a drummer boy. He seen things he thought a boy should never see. This is a good book for everyone. I think its a good history and lurning book.This is a magical, historical, and colorful book. So I think everyone should read it if they have the chance.Bye......"
5,Great book for both Christian life and comic book fans...,This book is excellent in its analysis of both comic heroes and Christian principles. The references of comic book hero history are very accurate. The various citations of Scripture verses are both relevent and fulfilling.
1,Nonsense,"The title says it all. If you need a superhero, you certainly can find one in the comics, and you certainly can find virtue and vice there, but implying that 'finding what's holy' takes some sleuthing because it is hidden is just wrong. Implying that it is hidden suggests that the you are going to need the writer's interpretation, when in fact it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what is going on in a comic strip, and the author's perspective is pretty skewed.For example, the author claims that more and more school sports events are being deliberately scheduled on Sundays in order to break up Christian families and their worship schedules. Does the author not know that other faiths worship on Saturdays and that there are only two days in a weekend? Think 'Lebensraum', and the rest is history.Anyone who is as shamelessly self-centered as this does not deserve a soapbox."
1,Disappointed hero,This is not what I expected. I actually threw the book in the trash. I was looking for a book that would be able to use for children especially little boys to help develop good heroes. This book is intended for adults but I wasn't impressed there either. I read some and not how I would present the subject. I think I get what the author was trying to say. But to me Christ is beyond a superhero. To lower Him to compare to a comic hero doesn't work for me. He is my Holy Savior.
2,Dry Read,So I was hoping this book would be more photographic. I understand that the book was written over a hundred years ago but since this is an updated version a photo at the start of each chapter would have still kept a good homage to the old manuscript. Otherwise many would still find this book to be archaic though it is a classic.
5,"Finally, The Victim's Story is Told","Most true crime books feature the life and times of the killer(s), with the victim portrayed as the unfortunate corpse in the first chapters. This book puts a human face on the victims.Courtney's struggle and bravery are heartbreaking and inspiring. This book shows how a moment of senselss violence, which is usually given a brief amount of news coverage, actually has a ripple effect that lasts a lifetime. A must-read."
5,Sad but thought provoking,"""Victim"" is a masterpiece of the true crime genre, for it was the first book to ever describe in painstaking and intimate detail the enormous physical, psychological, and financial traumas that are enforced upon the survivors of violent crime, and it exposed, also for the first time, how these survivors are often victimised again by an uncaring justice system where the rights of the accused always seem to come before the rights of the victimised."
4,very compelling,"I was given this book by a friend at work who is into true-crime stories. I never thought that I would be so facinated by this story. I thought it was a cliche, but I could not put this book down. We are rarely given the victims' side of the story. Kudos to Mr. Kinder for opening my eyes and showing me that the world is not always black and white."
2,Disappointing Account of Horrific Crime,"This book focuses on the victim's family, the victim, and the criminals in that order. Unfortunately the family's accounts seem to be quoted verbatim without much analysis, the victim is shown only as reflected by the family, and there is no real discussion of the criminals' motivation. This material could have been the basis for a much better book."
2,It's a Nice Try....,"Phantom of the Opera is not an easy thing to perform, so over the years it has been repeatedly minced by untrained singers and musicians. Now, I don't mean to be rude, but if I wanted to hear something like this, I would listen to a parade marching band. It's pretty bland, and the ""vocal talent"" as it is referred to might as well be singing ""Domo Origato"" because that's what it sounds like. Unless you are tone deaf, ignore this."
2,Not the best toy,We had this toy for one day and the arm came off. My 5 year old has not been that interested in playing with it. Not the best toy I have purchased.
1,Out of date,"The book is OK for the layman. However it doesn't really get into how it works and how it cures. The case studies are also very old. However, it is an easy read and great for those who have never heard of Chinese Medicine before.A better book isthe web that has no weaver &Fundamentals of Chinese Medicine."
4,Accupuncture How it Works,"A real ""where the rubber meets the road"" read. For those who want to know more about the complete approach through accupuncture, Peter and Sandra do an excellent job in shedding all the light needed. An A-Z what I would term as a ""handbook"" on Accupuncture. I wish I had known about this book prior to my first treatment! A must read. L Jackson Olivebridge, NY"
5,Ronnies Rocking,"Ronnie's at it again. With a solid group of misican to support him, and a lot of well known songs,they let you know rock and roll, is really Ronnie Wood. As a whole with this recording, they keep each other tight and on key. they're letting the music flow, all while having a good time. Having given creation to ""it's only Rock and roll"", Silicone Grown plus others,you can tell his soul is in all of them. Here it becomes clear he is one of only a few, really execptionally talented musicians of our time. Never being the front man on vocals,his gravel voice on this set brings a real feeling to the stage. When he's on lead vocals or backing Bernard you know he's into the music, and when he's on fire, he's on fire! I've been to a number of his shows, with the Faces, the stones, his gun slinger tour with BO Didley and slide on this tour, he still show he's real and he can rock. If your a Faces or stones fan this set of music should be in your collection."
4,Woody Live --Again,"Live and Eclectic was released earlier this year on the other side of the pond. Thus, Woody fans in North America have been eagerly awaiting this release. This record is typical Ron Wood--Live and recorded at Electric Ladyland in New York City before a live studio audience on 12/12/92 and Austin, Texas on 11/13/93. Wood trades vocals with Bernard Fowler on these 13 tracks including material all previously released by Wood or other artists including the Faces and, of course, the Rolling Stones. Of particular interest are Wood's renditions of Black Limousine, Little Red Rooster, Stay With Me, I Know I'm Losing You, and the closer--It's Only Rock 'n' Roll. Breathe On Me is always my favorite Wood penned track. For Wood fans this live album will not disappoint."
5,One of the greatest CDs ever by one of the greatest bands,"A great follow up to their first album (Eight Legged Groove Machine).It's a shame that this band never got that big in the US, but I had the pleasure and privilege of seeing these guys in the late eighties/early nineties. This one of the greatest rock albums of all time. Every song is catchy and not in a bad way. This release also has a couple of extras such as covers of ""Gimme Some Truth"" and the Young Rascals' ""Get Together"" which weren't released on the original album version but I beleive were released as singles during this time. No way to describe this cd except buy it. If you're sick of all of the music on the radio, this will bring you back to a time when music meant something."
4,"""Hup"" by The Wonder Stuff","Well written songs delivered with attitude laced vocals make this a winning effort from The Wonder Stuff. Ranging from quasi-funk workouts to classic Brit Pop, ""Hup"" makes for enjoyable listening. Full and varied production touches like added banjo and violin help to round out the sound.Brit Pop fans should find this worth their time. The best songs on ""Hup"" (""Radio [...]"", ""Don't Let Me Down Gently"" and ""Cartoon Boyfriend"")would nicely fit on a compilation disc between The Soft Boys and Oasis. Good company, in my humble opinion."
5,fabulous!,"This stuff is fabulous. I'm Chinese and have used this brand for years. It's easy and foolproof as long as you measure precisely. Otherwise the tofu will not set properly. It produces a very silken textured tofu. If you want firmer, you can press it under a weight for an hour or two."
2,Nice product but way overpriced,"We were looking for furniture to hold our 42"" LCD HD TV and came across the Salamander Synergy 323 in Best Buy. They had it priced at $999 which seems to be some sort of price fix since, no matter where I look, including Amazon, the price is the same. At that price this furniture is absolutely in the realm of the ridiculous. Adding further insult injury is the fact that you have to actually put this stuff together yourself. At half the price I would probably have given this 4 stars since it seems to be designed well. The rear panels, for example, can easily be removed for access to your video or audio equipment. Some of the materials, especially the perforated steal inserts, seem somewhat cheap. The rest of the materials that make up the stand are just OK.If you are looking to buy an item like this in this price range I suggest you look at a fine furniture store that discounts."
5,One of my favorite bands ever!,"The Vapors were one of the most interesting 'new wave' bands, and unfortunately, they called it quits far too early in their career. It was a joy to discover this reissue on CD. Nearly 20 years later, I still find my self playing their music, noodling along on my guitar and marveling at how bloody CLEVER they were. Their big hit (Turning Japanese) was amusing and light enough, but hardly representative of the breadth of their talent. If you listen to this CD, you will hear that every track on both LPs was a contender. Pop craftsmanship has always been in short supply, but the Vapors seemed to have a limitless stash of it. Makes me hopeful... perhaps when this pointless ""Disco Rebirth"" phase has ended, we can have a ""New Wave Rebirth"". Maybe I will even get the old scooter running again... :)"
3,I love Turning Japanese but...,"the quality drops off pretty fast afterwards. Some of the songs are decent. ""News at 10"", ""Waiting for the Weekend"", and ""Spring Collection"" show off the bands considerable pop hooksmanship, but the quirky humor that made ""TJ"" so memorable is pretty much absent in the rest of the Vapors' work. If you like new wave from this period compare ""New Clear Days"" and ""Magnets"" to the Cars' first two albums, and you can see why one group went on to megastardom and one to obscurity."
5,Great condition,"Great book. Arrived in like new condition. Have been reading books by this author and was unable to get this one at the library, was very happy to have found it one line. If you like Tracie Peterson or Judith Pella you will not be disappointed."
5,The best !!! but getting so hard to find !!,"I have been using this gel for 7-8 years and also FX Root Lifter, and these are really the best gels ever, as other reviews have said. I have fine, wavy hair that tends to be either ""flyaway"" or limp. Other products either (1) build up like glue, (2) make my hair instantly oily, or (3) are useless, do nothing after about 1 hr. I used to be able to find the FX products anywhere in Chicago, but Osco and CVS stopped carrying it. Now the last few weeks it looks like Walgreen's doesn't carry it either. So after a month of buying, trying, and throwing out other gels that don't work, I'm shopping online for FX. Hopefully, they will never stop making this! There's just no substitute."
2,"Unfortuneately did not work for me, left my hair feeling waxy","* Unfortuneately FX Curl did not work for me, left my hair feeling waxy* But I was really hoping it would have for the price* My hair is med-thick, normal to dry, and wavy curls* I am glad it works for others"
5,Great toddler distractor,I got these so my almost 2 y/o would have something to play with in the kitchen other than mommy. She loves them and is learning the names of animals also. They seem to be well made and the magnet is full sized not just a little magnet stuck on the back.
5,Great way to give a toddler something to do in the kitchen,My 19 month old liked these magnets right away. They are very nice quality and easy for small hands to grab and stick on the fridge. I have appreciated having a kitchen activity to keep a toddler occupied for a while as I'm making dinner. I switch them out with the dinosaurs to keep it interesting and will likely get the letters next. I agree with the reviewer that it's strange that the wood box doesn't have a lid. I keep these in ziplock bags.
5,Love it,Great product to have in your kitchen to keep an eye on the kids while you are preparing supper or whatever.
1,Looks Aren't Everything,I gave this set and the alphabet set to my nephew for Christmas....Looks great and they are very pretty but they don't stick well at all!! My sister ended up throwing them out rather than kicking them around her kitchen--very embarassing!
5,Great Magnets!,"We bought the dinosaur magnets for my 4 year old and my 2 year old loved them so much, I ordered the farm animal set for him!"
3,Kiddos Love them,These are great magnets and fun for the kiddos to play with. The bad thing is though...the perfect wooded storage box doesn't have a lid. Really???
4,Very colorful,Love all the animals that kids know. Disappointed that they were made in China. Thought Melissa & Doug products were made in the US. That is why I purchased them.Like the full magnet on the back.
5,Cute for the money,"We got this to go with a handmade magnet board for our 2 year old grand daughter for Christmas. The magnet are cute and yet natural in their marking easy for her to identify. The magnets seem strong enough to hold them in place really well. My ONLY complaint is that the ""top"" of the box does not fit to ""stay"" on. The wooden box is cute and her mom will use it for other things but we had to get her a ""plastic"" clear box to store them in when she is not using them."
4,My 10 month old loves these magnets!,"These are probably my daughters favorite toys right now. She carries the magnets all around the house and has figured out how to put them back on the fridge (or anything magnetic). Unfortunately she is still in the ""chew everything"" stage, so the paper stickers are not holding up as well as they would if she wasn't eating them. I didn't realize that wooden magnets would have sticker pictures on them - I thought they would be painted - this is my only complaint."
3,Good for toddlers learning about animals,"My daughter is one and loves animals and magnets, but these don't hold her attention for very long. I like them for teaching her about animals and animal sounds, but she won't play with them on her own. They are also too thin for her to easily take off the refrigerator and put them back on.I also bought the LeapFrog Fridge Farm Magnetic Animal Set, and that's much better for keeping her entertained on her own. (The pieces are chunkier and have optional sounds and music).Overall, good images of animals but probably good for kids who are a little older."
2,Beware: magnets are made of paper over wood,"These magnets are very cute - bright colors and I love that the materials are non-toxic. The animal illustrations are really nice. However, I was expecting magnets made of wood. The core is wood, but the face is paper, which comes off. Disappointing. Also, the wooden box they come in has no lid, so is pretty useless for storage."
2,Flimsy paper pictures,"First, our 15 month old daughter has enjoyed playing with these for the day she's had them. That said, she's already managed to completely remove and destroy 90% of the lion picture from the magnet. They're cheap, weakly stuck on stickers on top of fairly solid wood/magnet bases. Disappointing."
3,Truly not for small kids,"I got this, even though the reviews were not favorable for small kids. I'd had to put it up until they are older b/c the other reviewers weren't kidding the top ""stickers"" come off in a hot second. One trip into the mouth and the sticker was immediately coming off. They also are so skinny that the end up under the fridge as soon as they come off. I'll try these again in a year or so when my kids understand not to put them in their mouths."
3,Poor quality,"I have always loved Melissa and doug toys but was extremely disappointed when I received this magnet set in the mail. I thought they would be a little more durable, but they are very thin and the magnet is weak. I purchased them for my son to play with on the fridge and after about two minutes, the giraffe's design had come off. I put it on the top so my son couldn't reach it. My son loves to chew on things and he literally had the pig in his mouth for ten seconds and the pig design came off. I am not sure I would buy another set like this again. Very disappointed:("
5,Lots of fun!,My children got this for Christmas! They have enjoyed playin different games that I set up with the magnets. We studied animals right after Christmas so this was perfect for sorting by different classifications! I also had my daughter get the abc magnets and spell each animal -- SHE LOVED THIS! The magnets are durable and thats always what I look for! I have 3 kids so I look for price and durabilty! I love Melissa and Doug items! I have a ton of the items they make and know that when I buy something with that name I am getting my moneys worth!!!
5,Got 2!,"Super perfect for small hands, colorful, bright,durable. Grandson loves them! Got one for a friend too. Child friendly And cute"
5,Great Magnets!,"My 21 month old son loves these. They are much nicer than most magnets. They are not like most flimsy magnets, they are very sturdy. He loves rearranging them and making the animal sounds and naming them."
5,My grandson loved them,We got my grandson a easle for Christmas and wanted something else for it besides the letters that come with it. And these were perfect..
4,Well Made and Fun,"I gave these to my 2-year-old for her birthday a month ago. She had fun unpacking and identifying each animal, and while they're not getting daily play at this point, I have hopes that as she grows she'll start to engage with them in more creative ways. They seem well constructed and hardy, so I have no particular fears that she'll destroy them before really growing into them."
3,cheap,"I was a little surprised by this toy. Creatures are a little cheaply made. If you got them for little ones they are a little hard for them to take off of the fridge, very flat and adhere pretty good."
3,ideal but not durable,"i bought these for my 18 month old vs. waiting until my child was two years old, as the recommended age.i'm thinking i should have waited as my child is not done putting things in their mouth.i had high hopes for this set, along with the dinosaurs. vivid colors are really nice.i really like that the magnet portion which takes up the whole back of the piece.they seem a bit flimsy though; easy to bend, at least in adult hands.the biggest drawback is that the product cannot get wet or the paint comes right off and the design is destroyed.despite my complaints, i'm glad i bought these and hopefully they'll make it through and be used for years to come."
2,Pictures Wear Off Immediately,"These are a great idea, my 16 month old loved them when I bought them for her because she loves animals. She loves to point at the animals and make the sounds they make. However, they should be made of a more durable material other than paper because even the first day the images were wearing off, and that is sad they won't be one of her lasting educational toys. Also the wooden box they come in should have a lid."
5,Glad I got it,"Everything about this mixer is good: the attachments, the size, the power, the style, the ease of cleaning, the quietness. It only weighs 11 pounds -- it's practically portable. It makes wonderful breads & pizza dough.What I especially like about it is that it doesn't overmix. The speed control lets you use a light touch. I can cut in fats for pie dough or biscuits and get light & flaky results. Cakes don't come out tough & dry."
5,excellent for a beginner,"This book made understanding art easy. I especially enjoyed the cd rom that came with it, which gave interactive ''flash cards'' to help me memorize dates, artists, media, and famous (and not so famous) works."
3,understanding art,this book is what I need and is reasonably priced for the condition of the book. it arrived in the time stated in the ad.
1,sent wrong book,they did not specify that it was the study guide instead of the actual book I needed.
3,Art Textbook,"This book is the previous edition from the one required for the class. Most of the material is the same, but there is an extra chapter in the newer edition and some of the art work is different. Overall, it was a GREAT investment at a savings of over $100 over the newer edition."
4,good,"I received my book, in the condition stated, and in a timely manner. I appreciate the great service! Thank you!"
5,A great book!,"""Anna and the King of Siam"" is really a great book. Even though a lot of this story is fictional and based on some facts, its still fascinating. The book is very in depth, with a lot of detail. The story does become dull at times, particulary after Tuptim's death, but the book still picks up again. It was interesting to see how many more characters there are, their weren't used in all the movies of this story.This book is definetly a great book for anyone interested in finding out more of the story of Anna and the King."
2,A Dull Classic,"Based on the 'original' books by Leonowens one might expect some editing of that which was dull. The book is not well written. It is actually a tougher read than the original. It lacks pace. It is historically unsound (see first review by teenage student of history). But there are moments when an atmosphere is created which, on reflection, is stolen from the original. I had to force myself to read it as part of a list of books I wish to cover. I think the writer knew nothing of Thailand."
5,Thank you,"Some times ago i wathed movie ""Anna and the King"", i really like it. After this i wanted to read book ""Anna and the King of Siam"". There isn't such books in my town. So i decided to use the net for this. And found this website and ordered the book. How pleased i was to get it after so short time. about one week, thank you.I enjoy reading this book, i love to find something new which i didn't saw in the film. The plot of this story is thrilling. And the most important that these book and film was based on the real story of the real woman Anna Leonowens. Her fate was particularly unusual and difficult, but she was so brave and intelligent. Anna was able to go through all the difficulties and gave her light to Siam. I regret that i didn't read this book before.I would recommend this book to anyone, who enjoy novels and even those who didn't wathed the film. Because it's one of the best film i've ever seen and one of the best book i've ever read."
1,Nothing but lies and fabrications and extremely upsetting to the Thais,"Thais have been outraged by the lies of Anne Leonowens for decades, since her 'books' were published and the first movie 'The King and I' came out.Leonowens stories were nothing but that, 'stories'. She barely met the King of Siam, as a woman of her stature (a lowly governess) would never have been allowed the access to the King she says she was given. King Mongkut was a highly-educated monarch, who knew more about foreign policy and diplomacy than most people in this era. In fact, Anna Leonowens was no more influential with King Mongkut than I am with Queen Elizabeth. She was just a good fiction writer.That Thais are not featured in the movies (in the latest one, the main actor is Chinese) says a lot about the validity of the information, and that both movies are banned in Thailand, where Thais revere King Mongkut and King Chulalongkorn.Worthless reading if you want to actually learn something about the history of Thailand."
1,Pure fantasy mascarading as history,"To call King Mongkut a bloodthirsty tyrant much less a barbarian not only slanders his memory but downright belittles his legacy. As if only Christian western culture has a monopoly on virtue, the book only pictures the king as a lusty womanizer. Never mind the fact that he could have been king at a much earlier age, he chose instead to become a buddhist monk to live a life of poverty and celibacy for more 20 years where he witnessed first hand the suffering of his people and became familiar with western ways. Would our own president or even Gandhi have his restraint we would have elevated them to sainthood instead of being maligned and slandered as Ms Langdon and to much greater extent Mrs. Leonowens had."
2,"Enjoyable, but far from the truth...","I am 15, so to establish my credibility I must explain that I am currently writing an enormous research paper on the controversy over various written and film versions of Anna and the King of Siam. After roughly three months of extensive background research, I read this book and found it to be almost entirely untrue. I believe that those who claim King Mongkut would not have accomplished what he did without Mrs. Leonowens counsel are disillusioned and clearly have not read much on the subject. He was an extremely enlightened and well-educated monarch with no reason to engage in conversation with an English schoolteacher. Many people actually believe that she met the King only once, or not at all. Despite the glaring errors, however, I have seen both the musical and the newest version with Jodie Foster and enjoyed them immensely. Read this book and see the movies only if you are aware that they are fictional."
5,I loved this book~,"Kim, the main character has a lot on her plate to deal with, but I'm impressed at her maturity. I also liked the fact that she sees her own mistakes, the cute little quirks about writing her column, and I was quite surprised by the twist near the end. I wasn't expecting that so soon, but it made me cry. I think this book would be a good book for any teen because it shows teens being teens, and their (human side)--that we are all capable of making mistakes, but we learn from them. Kim is a good role model. I'm forty-nine years old, and I enjoyed this book so much, I ordered the other two."
1,Low price but...,"How about they tried to ship this to me four, yes four, times and it came broken every time. I finally gave up on the idea of a conveniently delivered item and purchased the same item from Ace Hardware. Reasonably attractive and easy to install, you save money on the extra stuff you need (wax ring, bolts, etc.) that come with this package.The performance of the 1.6 gallon flush is disappointing. The toilet fails to clear itself, even under reasonable demand, about 50% of the time. Keep a plunger handy.If I had it to do over again, I'd recommend researching toilets first and ordering one that is reported to flush effectively. Also, do that and then check Craig's List for your area. Toilets are fairly often offered there for free or for good prices. A little more trouble, but you may well save yourself some money.As for ordering it here, I can't recommend that. True, roads are bumpy where I live, but the packaging was insufficient. Good luck to you."
3,"Please, Mr. Barlow, don't shoot my armadillo!","Michener can get run off on some the most boring, technical details that have no place in a well-written novel, but Texascertainly educated me about that unusual state. I was entertained more than not, but great characters and plot were sporadic. I can't help comparing him to Clavell and Jennings, and that's not fair to the guy. I will read his other work, but I'm going to hold off for a bit. I think Michener will appreciate this, though. I turned the last page much wiser than when I opened the cover. Enlightening."
4,A Very Long Michener,"Michener's books are long and all of us who are fans know this, but this one is probably the longest one. It does get a bit tedious at times, but the book is very good and it's worth persevering with it. I don't know what our reader from Denmark was thinking, but the book is certainly not dreadful. I found the history of this state totally fascinating, and it felt like I was there when Texas was just coming into being I felt like one of those intrepid settlers that were responsible for making Texas a state. I would like to visit this state sometime because it has a great history. The story was good and the characters strong. I especially liked the story about the Alamo. This almost mythic battle comes alive in the book. America you have a lot to be proud of in this state."
5,Michener's Best Fiction,"I'm actually surprised by some of the negative responses of the previous reviewers. Their opinions are certainly valid, and I wouldn't quibble with them, but I thought ""Texas"" was Michener's best fiction (""Iberia"" is his best book) that I've ever read.The history of the state was fascinating and well-balanced. The characters were more likable than in most of his books (except maybe ""Chesapeake""). The book certainly is long even by Michenerian standards, but it never became tedious in the way ""Alaska"" did.I think anyone who reads this book will be delighted by the magnificent effort Michener must have put into writing this. It's fun; it's fascinating; it's beautiful."
5,ANOTHER GREAT NOVEL ABOUT PEOPLE........,"THIS IS AS INTERESTING AS CENTENNIAL, ALASKA, AND CHESAPEAKE. IHAVE HAWAII TO READ NEXT. I LIKE THE WAY JAMES MICHENER WRITES MAKING HISTORY ENJOYABLE. AS A HISTORY MAJOR IN COLLEGE I AM ALWAYS GLAD WHEN SOMEONE WRITES IN SUCH A WAY THAT HISTORY IS INTERESTING TO THOSE WHO MIGHT NOT EXPOSE THEMSELVES TO IT. THISBOOK IS FULL OF BOTH FACT AND FICTION, BUT HE TELLS YOU UP FRONTWHAT IS WHAT. ALSO IT IS JUST PLAIN INTERESTING AND VERY EASY TOREAD. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS AS WELL AS THE BOOKS ABOVE FOR ONE WHO IS INTERESTED IN HISTORY BUT NOT JUST FACTS."
3,danhec,"I NEVER RECIEVED THE BOOK I HAD ORDERED, I WAITED WEEKS. AS SOON AS I COMPLAINED TO THE SELLER I PROMPLY RECIEVED A REPLACEMENT."
1,Disapointed,"The discription of the book was 1st edition.It was not 1st edition.Seller would accept a return, but ofcourseI would be out the shipping cost to return it."
4,Gargatuan Novel,"I think this is Michener's longest and consequently one of his best that I have read. Michener uses his typical formula shows the historical development of Texas from the 16th century to present (1980). What makes this work is that he shows the evolution through the eyes of different families (with varying ethnicity's) throughout different generations. You get to see the Texan perspective from differing points of view. Warning, it's a very long read, but looking back well worth it."
4,"A long, a very long read","As a transplant from California to Texas, we have found that the culture and the pride in this state are unprecedented and wanted to understand why and how it came about. My husband began reading the Lone Star which is a historical factual book--even longer than Texas. But my book was obviously the most exciting as I finished mine about three weeks ago and he is still struggling with his. Both books give clear examples, stories, and amazing facts about Texas and although it took me 62 years and my husband 70 years, we got here as fast as we could! Texans are a different breed and in order to understand this, you just have to live here, get to know these wonderful people and then read the history."
4,For young children,"This book is for young children just starting to read. The color illustrations are in a somewhat simplistic (primative) are form, and the poems are short (a lot of white space in the book). Overall, it is kept simple for young children, but some of the phonetic spellings are probably not the best for proper teaching."
3,Good book- what about the Athletics,"Good book. Could be better. Growing up in Philly as a die hard baseball fan I am dissapointed with the lack of information on the Athletics. Whether they left town 50 years ago or not, they are the city's most successful sports franchise. Period."
3,A place to start,"It's tiny, and it's printed on one side of the page only, and it doesn't cost ANYTHING, so if you want a large-brimmed Victorian style hat, or perhaps a crownless sweetheart hat, or you think you might like to make a hat any hat and have no clue where to start, this is a good place to jump in.Given my propensity to spend $$$$ on the how-to and then not follow through, I went for this book, and it meets my needs exactly. I have the fashion fabric I want to use; BHA tells me what else I need to put it together and make a hat that looks respectable. Wouldn't have thought to put darts in the brim on my own.If and when I do make this hat, and if I decide the effort was worth it and I want more, I may well step up to the complete millenary book noted above in a different review. Until then, I'm not out much $ at all and I have massively adjusted my own ""figure it out somehow"" ideas about what goes into a big pretty hat."
4,The Little Hatmaking Book,"It's definitely a ""little"" book but it has some interesting information. I will get my money's worth."
5,Simply Excellent Music,"As more a jazz fan rather than an expert who knows little about Danny Zeitlin, I hesitate to add too much to this, except to say that this CD is consistently enjoyable throughout.I put this on my iPod - where I have many jazz piano recordings - and I found that when I put the thing on shuffle, I keep on discovering that the beautiful, melodic, and harmonically interesting song I just listened to is by Danny Zeitlin. Wow."
5,WOW! Good News and Not So Good News - REVISITED!,"The good news is TERRIFIC NEWS IN THAT THE buyer gets Denny's 1964 album ""Cathexis"" in its entirety WITH concentration on Zeitlin's superb originals with ten! A review indicated ""The not so good news is that only five of the nine original cuts from the ""Carnival"" LP"" - BUT what is not mentioned is that the tracks included from Carnival also concentrate on Zeitlin's superb originals with three more!"
3,quality and not quantity,"this is a great old blues cd. anything with goldberg, musselwhite, and harvey mandel is a combination for classic, chicago blues. it also rocks good too. if you like early yardbirds, you'll like this cd. my only complaint is even with the bonus song, it is only 28' minutes long! that's not a lot of time. also, i'm not a big buddy holly fan and he does one of his covers. overall, it is an excellent cd for your blues collection."
3,It's certainly not like Broadway,"This recording has nothing to do with the Broadway version. The music sounds fake, like it is done in a computer, and there are only four singers. But the best themes were selected, and they are sung beautifully. I think that the best song was ""Memory"". The other songs do not transmit as much energy as the Broadway version, but they are sung well. The music doesn't help the singers at all, as I said it sounds fake."
2,Expensive piece of junk!,The motor of this toy is built very cheaply. It broke after only two times. The gears inside de motor box are made of cheap plastic and started shredding in white plastic dust! My son loved it at first and was very frustrated and disappointed. Plus the robot goes forward and backwards only and very very slow...Please do not get caught: Don't buy this cheap piece of junk!
1,Disappointing,"This toy was a big disappointment. The potential for lots of fun and learning was defeated by the immediate (within half an hour) disintegration of the motor gears. The plastic shaved off after two or three uses. If the gears had held up, this toy could have been great."
1,Through the Lens,"I was very disappointed in this book............not only were the pictures just ok, the book is so small..........do not buy it for a coffee table book. you won't be able to find it."
2,Mediocre,"For such a large book, the images that are exceptional are few. I was disappointed, given the huge assortment of excellent NG photos from which to choose, that these were deemed ""greatest."" Worth the $20, but not much more."
5,Nat. Geo. Greatest Pix Review,"I fancy myself to know a good photo when I see one and I was humbled by the really great photos in this book. I suppose it all depends on what you like, but since these are the pix they chose to include and I think they are great, either they or I agree with each other. Buy it. It will amaze you and when you leave it out for discovery, it will amaze your friends!"
4,"Good collection, but a bit of a rehash","This is a great collection of NG photos--a bit of a rehash of past books, and quality appears to have suffered in favor of quantity (it's huge!). I agree with the previous reviewer--images have been cropped at times and tend to lose something as a result. But you can't beat the value."
2,"Disappointed, not what I expected","My mistake, I did not check the actual dimensions of this volume, being a big fan of National Geo's photo volumes, I ordered the book expecting a large coffee table volume, but as it turned out, what I received was less than half the size of my other volumes. The book is approx 6in x 6in vs an expected 12in x 12in. It is what I ordered, but in such a small size that it is hard to appreciate the photos. If you're considering ordering this, carefully review the product details to be sure that it is what you actually want."
2,TINY!!!,"I wish I had read the dimensions before buying this book - I assumed it was a nice, big, coffee table book. It's about 6 inches square. The pictures are nice, but they're too small to enjoy. I don't know why someone would publish a book like this in such a small format."
1,BIG dissapontment!!-Very Poor Quality of the Photographs Print!!!,"Be aware, 10$ for 250 pages of photographs...what else could you expect? All photoes printed with such a low quality! Terrible! I loved the photoes , but it ruined my experience with noisy, low quality prints that Im returning it back. I also have to say I contacted the seller (I purchased from Paragon Books) and they said they dont take responsibility cause they are not publisher!! And will accept my return but still will charge me for 20% of total price...what ever!! I dont want this usless book and will return it!"
4,Perfect gift for the photo enthusiast,"Given as a gift to daughter. She loves photography, and loved the National Geographic photo book. Unlike a traditional table book, the smaller size is perfect for sharing and carrying."
2,National Geographic Through the Lens - A Review,"An avid reader and fan of Nationl Geographic for 5 decades, I wasdisappointed in the book. More than half of the featured photographs were recent, many taken in the last 5 years. So many of the breath taking pictures that I remeber were not included. I cannot even guess at what the critera was for photographs to be included in this book but, in my opinion, these are not the best of National Geographic."
4,$18 is worth it,"For $18, this is a huge book with enough full-page images to fill your lazy Sunday tea time.Just as much as many of Henri-Cartier Bresson's publications are a rehash of previous publications plus new images, I found only several of the images are from previous old publications. However, I consider these as almost symbols of the NG series.As a photographer, I have since gone thru the book 3 times and I find the images entertaining and lovely to soak in."
1,Through the Lens: National Geographic's Greatest Photographs,We were highly disappointed in this book. The photos were grainy and certainly not National Geographics greatest! We have seen absolutely stunning shots from them in the past and not one was included in this book. It was a great disappointment.
1,Disappointed!,The front jacket was beautiful and caught my eye. Being an artist I wanted beautiful photos for source material. What a let down when I received the book! The photos were not even worth flipping through. Many were in black and white. Not the quality I expected from National Geographic. If you want beautiful stunning photos don't order this one.
3,Big book,This is a beautiful book although it arrived damaged. I'd suggest buying it at a book store so you don't incur shipping damages as I did. Amazon didn't do a good job packaging it to protect it.
4,Through the lens...,"good delivery service, good value for dollar, like all Nat'l Geo products, book is excelllent"
3,Disappointing,"Hmmm. Some spectacular shots indeed but compared to my recollection of many years as a subscriber to the magazine, few of these would have been chosen by me and many NOT chosen should have been for such a collection.Frankly, I was disappointed."
3,Concept of reviewing all of the world,"By using different concept, throught the lens provide me another experience for myself to review what I have seen the world. Remind myself, there are lots opportunities for me to explore more experience during each photo that been taken from works, daily life, with friends, family or even snap shot simply happen around of us."
5,Marquez?,"I've had this book on my shelf ever since the Village Voice put Rux on the cover as one of their writers on the verge of shaking up the literary landscape. I just never got around to reading it and then lent it out and never got it back. Recently I ordered the second edition, distributed by Autonomedia.org and this time I READ it and I thought I was reading Gabriel Garcia Marquez...if I had known this book was this impressive, I would've read it the first time. Few young poets today have Rux's ability to create images as vibrant as he does. It's the stories in this book that impress me the most!"
5,Mr. Excitement,"I saw Jackie Wilson at Scarlet O'Hara's in Underground Atlanta on either October 31st or November 1st of 1972. He was, as my title suggests, an electrifying performer, one of the greats.All of his great hits are here with the exception of 1 top 20 song and a few others that were in the top 40. However, in my opinion, that does not diminish this double CD as none of those songs are my favorites. This is the most complete compilation of Jackie Wilson's hits with three, from March of 1960 to January of 1961, being covers of classical staples, Night, Alone At Last and My Empty Arms.I guarantee that any Jackie Wilson fan who buys this double CD will play it at least 3 times before playing something else."
2,Only 1 or 2 good songs,I was disappointed in the selection of song on the CD. I expected more rememberable songs on this CD I got.
5,Fascinating insight into history!,Fascinating insight into the relationship between two of the most important men of that era. Details revealed about the thinking behind some of the critical decisions that shaped the outcome of World War II. You get a first hand glance into the personalities of the two men.
4,Really insightful! Fantastic read and research book,"This is a really good resource book to have. A friend gave it to me as a gift, and jsut as I thought I already knew everything about WWII, this book surprises me with new facts straight from Stalin and Roosevelt themselves! The book guides you through each president's thought process and how they dance through political fires with wit and strategy. Roosevelt is much more fascinating now that I see how he thinks. I wished this book has some pictures I can refer to. That will be even better. Highly recommended if you want to read about 2 impt leaders and WWII."
4,Shallots--wonderful in cooking,"Shallots are a terrific addition to one's pantry. They have a nice taste, less obtrusive than some onions. They can be used in recipes in a variety of ways. I like gently sauteeing them and including them on sandwiches or in other recipes.A good addition to anyone's pantry. . . ."
4,Garden of Life Digestive Enzyme,"Excellent product, but rather expensive for the size. Dosage instructions were difficult to find. The mini scoop inside the product was at the bottom of the powder, and was difficult to find."
3,"Taste is not great, but the stuff works.","The only thing I do not like about this product is the taste. Even though I add this to my Protein shakes, smoothies. It addes a funny after taste. I ussally use one teaspoon to each shake. I do not recommend adding this to orange juice. It made the orange juice taste like vomit. By adding some kind of sweetner like honey or agva sweeter helps with the taste."
1,Haven for Incestuous Perverts,"In a nutshell this book is about a brother and sister (both teenagers) who run away together to a motel and spend a few days banging each other. In detail.Why? I think the only purpose of this book is to shock and gross out the reader, and it succeeds beautifully.If you have ever fantasized about banging your sibling, then this is the perfect book for you!"
2,"Useful, but not necessary","Upon first appearance you think this is a fun tool to teach volleys. Maybe, but did not prove particularly useful."
2,Not his best,"I love Wilbur Smith and most of his books are awesome, this one I would skip.....Just not great like so many of his other classics...."
4,Mass Produced Novel,Not one of my favorite Wilbur Smith novels but a middle of the line novel by him. Too fanciful a plot lacking any of the historical fiction that I enjoy in most of his Africa series books.
1,Infanticide and assorted gore (again),"Smith is sick. ""The Angeles Weep"" contains a disgusting murder of an unborn fetus, and this book has the immolation of an infant girl. There is the usual assortment of other blood and gore, of African animals, indigenous people, and whites. It may be historically accurate, but it isn't my thing. I have helped future possible readers of this book by destroying it. Once again, I emphasize: this author needs professional help dealing with his bloodlust."
2,The only Wilbur Smith book I will never read again.,"I have read Wilbur Smith's books for years and have (almostalways) enjoyed them greatly, even tremendously (""The Sunbird"").However, this book is the exception; Mr. Smith must have written it during a very difficult time in his life because it isalmost incredibly depressing in that at the end EVERYBODY DIES!I have also long been interested in the Great War in East Africa,and I thus had high hopes for this book. But... it was just toodark & depressing.Although other books have had dark & depressing elements (andeven endings), none has been so downbeat. I have kept it just toremind me that even Wilbur Smith has a klinker to his credit."
3,Two original LPs on one CD!,"It's great that Collectable's has reissued these two fine Cramer LPs on CD, but the sound quality is a little flawed. It almost sounds as if these tracks were mastered from...vinyl? Could it be? I'm not sure but Collectable's has been making upgrades to their quality with great consistency, so if they have the good taste to do some more Cramer twofers I'm sure the sound quality will be better in the future."
2,yawn,"I was so excited at the prospect of another Karl Jenkins musical offering, but what a disappointment this recording was after Adiemus IV -in fact, tracks 6 & 9 are simply mediocre re-hashes (""the Dagda"" and ""Isle of the Mystic Lake"", respectively). Heed my advice- save your money and buy only Adiemus IV. Imagined Oceans lacks the energy and the musical imagery of any of the Adiemus. It just sounds like something slapped together to make another buck off of the Adiemus reputation. Shame on you, Mr. Jenkins!"
2,Just nostalgia should not make a movie great,"I like western, but this movie is waaaaaaaaaayy weak. Bad acting from multiple characters, absurd victory of the ""good-guys"" corny expressions--too many slapstick moments.I think the story is the problem and so is the direction. The landscape and soundtrack is gorgeous. If you can tolerate bad parts and weak acting--go for it. Otherwise, pass."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A mediocre western that doesn't take enough time to develop characters and falls far short of the Japanese original (though it is mercifully shorter), The Magnificent Seven has little to recommend it aside from Eli Wallach's performance and Steve McQueen's iconic cool--if you can make it through the scene where Charles Bronson lectures the peasant children about heroism without laughing, I salute you."
5,movie review,"Brings me back to the time I saw the movie as a kid. You can make all the ""Avatar"" movies you want ......... But when the dust clears .......... ""The Magnificent Seven"" is still a must have for your video collection. The Blu Ray has the sound and picture quality of the original movie, as seen in theaters."
4,A Classic Companion Movie,"""The Magnificent Seven"" will have more appeal to American audiences than its Japanese progenitor, ""Seven Samurai,"" but is a pale shadow to the later. The main reason to own ""The Magnificent Seven"" is enjoy and learn the heritage of cinematography starting with Sergei Eisenstein (""Battleship Potemkin,"" ""Alexander Nevsky,"" etc.) to Akira Kurosawa (""Seven Samurai,"" ""Ran,"" etc.) Very good movies such as ""The Magnificent Seven"" stand on the shoulders of giants in the history of movies. The best reason to own this DVD is to compare it side by side with ""Seven Samurai"" in the uninterrupted space and time of one's own home."
5,Magnificent Seven for the xyz generations,"This is a classic of cowboy value of peace and justice. The seven are hired to defend the villagers against bandits in the wild west. Of significance was the dialogs between Charles Bronson and a kid who admired his ""hero"" with a gun. Bronson gave a meaningful answer - a hero is the man who works hard in shouldering his family responsibility (an ordinary man doing extra-ordinary job)His answer sounds true then and now. This film shows what is black and white, war and peace, right and wrong, justice and law, strong and weak, rich and poor.Do we need the magnificent seven for Washington, Wall Street, Main Street while enjoying this classic?"
4,"Wanted to Give it 5 Stars, BUT...","This movie was excellent, from the brassy music to the awesome cast and storyline (from The Seven Samurai. It is just too bad that there are at least three scenes that require the viewers to leave the room until they are over. All three of these feature a certain person, played by Horst Buchholz. They say that his character's name is Chico, but I prefer to call him the ""Stupid Kid."" He is the only damper on an otherwise perfect movie. It is a terrible shame, from his lovely appearance, as he stupidly follows the hearse, to his speech to the farmers about how cowardly they are, to his love affair with the stupid girl, to his ....oh I can't go on....."
5,Excellent Biu ray,"They did this Blu ray correctly. The clarity is excellent. When a friend of mine and I were watching this we both kept remaking about the detail and the color. If you love ""The Magnificent Seven"" you'll love this Blu ray"
5,"Great Movie, great DVD","The Magnificent Seven has been one of my favorite movies since I first saw it as a child; this DVD does honor to a great American (Japanese?) Western by providing an excellent transfer of both the audio and visual components to the disk (something often botched in other DVDs of older films). Another pleasant surprise was the quality of the special features, often lacking or limited to trailers for the film. I particularly liked the documentary of the making of the film. It was loaded with fascinating details of the obstacles to bringing the film to life, as well as the rivalry among the stars of the film. All in all, well worth the money paid. If you've seen the ""7"" this is a way to enjoy it again; if you haven't seen it, then this is the next best thing to sitting in a darkened theater."
3,Pales by comparison to the original but still well worth seeing,Pales by comparison to the originalSeven Samuraiand has occasional clumsy acting but the stirring Elmer Bernstein score and the opportunity to watch a collection of manly Hollywood stars in their prime make it well worth seeing.
4,The Prince of all westerns,"This has to be my second favorite western of all time, that is why I entitle it ""prince,"" as the king of all westerns has to be ""Once upon a Time in the West."""
5,Magnificent,A classic! A rousing western. The strong protect the weak from the evil. Great cast and great acting. Even moments of humor. This film has endured the test of time and remains a crowd-pleaser.
5,magnificient seven,my favorite movie. should be more than 5 stars. have been watching this movie since i was a kid. its a keeper.
2,Boring Imitation,"Fashioned after the Seven Samurai, a Japanese film classic, this imitation was comparatively unrealistic and dull. Every one of Hollywood's actors, from Yul Brynner down to Horst, was impeccably dressed, with not a spot of dirt on their clothes, even though James Coburn spent most of his time lying in the dirt. The Mexicans must have been recruited from LA, because all of them spoke perfect English. And their clothes were spotlessly white! I have a problem with realism, being a fan of Samurai movies."
2,No Match for the original Seven Samaurai,"Grossly overdone, too loud, so bad in spots that it's just weird. I don't know where some of the 5-star ratings come from here. Perhaps my impression of this unglorious Hollywood fake is due to the fact that as a young-un in the 50's I managed to see ""Seven Samurai"" before seing this dreadful, dumbed-down Hollywood remake based on the original Japanese masterpiece. Or perhaps it's because I cannot -- repeat, cannot -- accept Yul Brenner as a cowboy. Or maybe it's just the soundtrack that turned me off, which sounds even worse in its digital reincarnation. The photography is a far cry from the original Oriental monochrome shot with Nikon lenses, and the actors and characters just don't have the stature of the original Samurai's. If you've never seen Seven Samurai, you might like this Technicolor forgery. But do yourself a favor and get the original Japanese version on DVD or even VHS. It's a different experience, entirely."
4,The Magnificent 7,"I picked up this movie on blu-ray at Target for $10 and what a bargain, I was expecting a bad transfer since it was so cheap and an old movie, but how wrong I was, the film looks great, clean, and even sharp at times, this movie looks better than most movies that was just made 10 years ago, the audio, the surround sound is not as good as the video but for a cheap price and for a great, classic movie like this one, it will do, believe me, it is not awful, either. What an incredible casts as well, most of them turned out to be big names in Hollywood, Brynner, McQueen, Bronson, Coburn, Vaughn, Wallach. Folks, I highly recommend this movie on blu-ray !!! ENJOY !!!"
4,terrific!,All around wonderful western. You couldn't ask for a better cast. Direction is solid. And that exceptional score! Wow.You also get a behind the scenes mini movie on how the film came together. Anyone who remembers and appreciates this flick should check out the great Japanese film it was based on: Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai.
1,the magnificent,i would show this movie to anyone at all because i did not like it one bit or at all.
5,Great movie,"This is a great old western classic. It is nice to see it in clear format and the color is beautiful. Amazon.com had great service and swift delivery, even out in the country. Our post office does not offer overnight service, but they still got here fast."
2,poor Hollywood adaptation of Seven Samurai,"Despite the all-start cast, the acting is wooden and the script terrible. Cliche-ed from start to finish. Wallach is good as the bad guy, Coburn occasionally smoulders; that's about it. Give me Takashi Shimura any day!"
5,always good,one of my favorite movieslike it all acting was great stars where awsome.anyone who never seen a great westurn.
5,Hillbilly Girl knows The Blues,"Those Crazy Blue Eyes, those mavericks that don't settle down. That Hillbillly Girl With the Blues. She's been beating those Hard Times with that voice that ranges from a sexy whiskey voice to a Whisper that tingles your spine.Lacy can bounce you around and get your foot stomping or she can share a broken heart with you. She is raucus and she is mellow. She can growl or purr like a kitten.Anthology puts her best together. Crazy Blue Eyes has to be the best of the lot but how do you pass up Tennesee Waltz, Hard Times, Whisper and my second favorite Hillbilly Girl with the Blues.Lacy is a true queen of country."
5,"""There's gonna come a time in life...""","""when you think you've reached the end, and that will be the beginning.""Lacy J. Dalton says this at the end of her ""Listen to the Wind"" on this wonderful anthology. Excellent CD, wonderful songs, speaks to me, to all of us who have dreams!"
4,Im sorry,I posted the review before this and i didnt meen it.I WAS JUST BEING STUPID.This cd is actually quite good.lacy has a geat voice.Buy this album.
1,Poor performance,This product worked for one month with very light use. One side quit working. Am returning even though I lose postage and 15%. Will not reorder.Poor quality!
2,Works but not that well,"The 6 Deck shuffler does actually work with 6 decks BUT many of the cards end up on the sides of the shuffler instead of on top of other cards.So, I guess you get what you pay for. That explains why professional card shufflers cost 10-20 times this one. Works better when 1-2 decks are loaded."
5,Flies through the cards,"This card shuffler has a lot more power than the other shufflers we have used. It really flies through the cards, mixing them up in a nice pile in the middle."
3,6 Deck Automatic Card Shuffler,Ordered two shufflers. One works well. The other works poorly - does not alays grab cards from right side.
3,"Does not shuffle very thoroughly for games using multiple decks, such as Canasta","I purchased this use for games such as Canasta, where there are multiple decks of cards and during game play you are building books or Canastas , that consist of same numbered cards. It does not seem to shuffle them very well, so we end up having to shuffle by hand anyway."
2,Wish I had read the reviews before I ordered,I ordered 3 of these card shufflers. One works just fine. On the second one the spring tray doesn't work and on the third one the left side only shuffles intermittently. Obviously they aren't checked to see if they are even working before they are shipped out. I would pay twice as much for a sturdier model.
5,Great item!!,We play alot of cards and we are always trying to shuffle six decks of cards. This shuffler works great. I am so glad I found it on amazon. Would buy this again is I needed.
5,6 Deck Automatic Card Shuffler for Blackjack,Bought this for a lady who is 86 and can't shuffle cards. She is extremely happy with it. It was mailed in a timely manner.
1,did not work,6 Deck Automatic Card Shuffler for Blackjack (Purchased on 01/20/2009)by Pachi ParadiceThis did not work my brother had to take it apart and reconnectwiring
1,Disappontment,I returned this card shuffler immediately because the plastic on one of the battery door hinges was broken. I can't tell you if this does a good job shuffling cards but I can tell you that the plastic material used in its construction is so cheaply made that I didn't want a replacement.
2,Jim,"Jams up all the time, I am not impressed at all w/ this item.I do not reccomend purchasing it.If I had to do it over, I would spend more & get a unit that is of a better quality"
1,Damaged,"I received a damaged Shuffler. I returned the Shuffler on December 13, 2008 through the Postal Service for a credit adjustment. It would not let me have a replacement so I have to place another order for one.Thank You,Cecelia"
1,what a disappointment,"After using the card shuffler only a few times, it would no longer work. The product seems to have defects."
2,Damaged,"The item was a Christmas gift for my daughter. It had a piece of plastic broken off, and not in the box. It also had a weak spring which made it function poorly. I have one that works fine, so I am familiar with the item. I am sure it was a returned item. However, it wasn't worth the time and trouble for us to return it. I am seriously disappointed with the CONDITION of this item. Someone needs better quality control.Kent"
4,Very good value,"I am very pleased with how it works. The maximum cards that should be shuffled though are four decks, not six."
1,Did not work,Unfortunatley for us we throw away the box before we checked to see if the product was working. Only one side of it works so it doesn't shuffle correctly. Make sure you check that it works before we recycle the box.
3,WORKS FAIR,WE PLAY ALOT OF CARDS. IT'S NICE TO SHUFFLE THE CARDS BUT IT TROWS THEM OUT SOME OF THE TIME. EASY TO USE AND WE STILL DO.
4,2 different models,"I recently ordered 2 of these shufflers for my clubhouse and was surprised to get 2 different models. The boxes were different sizes, but both said 4 AA batteries. When we opened them up, one was AA the other was C size batteries. One had feet, the other no; one had a domed top, the other had an octogonal shaped top. They both work, but I was a bit puzzled that they were not alike. Had I gotten one that had been returned and put in the wrong box?I am pleased with their operation so far. Let's see how long they last."
3,card shuffler,I've used it about four times before it stopped working. Had to tape the battery compartment shut and then got it to work. The cards sometimes go on the side of the shuffler instead of lying flat. It's okay. Better than shuffling a lot of decks by hand.
1,card shuffler,YES HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THEM NOT WORKING GOOD COULD SOMEONE CONTACT ME SINCE YOUR PHONE NUMBER IS A TOP SECRET.
2,"With batteries in it, it keeps on shuffling, can't use it because it is doing this","I received the shuffler, put in the batteries and used it once a week for 3 or 4 weeks. Now it just keeps on shuffling and I can't shut it off unless I take out a battery."
2,Disappointed,"The original card shuffler I bought years ago worked so much better. In fact, if I had the time, I would return this one. I am very disappointed in my purchase. I just wish it were easier to return merchandise bought on Amazon.com"
3,It's like a toy,I am disappointed with the quality of the shuffler. It feels like a children's toy bought from the toy shop. nothing like described. The cards keep getting stuck and the spring does not work properly
5,Excellent and very enjoyable,"I purchased this book and cassette program for my 3 young boys who have an interest in learning German. They LOVE the program! They sing the songs regularly. It's no wonder, the tunes are catchy and the lyrics are understandable.I highly recommend this!"
2,what happened to positive reinforcement?,"i feel that this program uses vocabulary that should not be introduced to children as primary words when beginning a foreign language. it talks of ghosts, witches and other ""scarey"" things. i just don't feel that those words are constructive, but that other positive more essential topics could have been chosen to sing and learn about."
5,a one-line summary of your review.,"There is an everflowing current of the past as present, or perhaps vice-versa, throughout the story, as though no time has passed or will pass, or could if it would, would if it could, as time is omnipresent though it doesn't really exist unless you look and depends on all from where one looks. Kawabata is looking in all directions: ""He gazed at it for a time. In a gourd that had been handed down three centuries, a flower would fade in a morning."""
2,Too sentimental,"The sentimental and sexual education of a young man, who gets entangled in a spider web concocted by one of his father's mistresses.The story is shrouded in an emotionally restrained and melancholic (remembrances of the passed away) atmosphere, which is always brutally broken by the interventions of the devilish intriguer.The novel is full of symbols, but should more appeal to the Japanese than to foreign readers. The tea ceremony is an important part of it, e.g. the author relates the deep impressions made by tea sets on the participants (because they have hundreds of years of age and their ancestors drank already out of them).Some reactions of the main characters seemed to me exaggerated and they cried nearly on every occasion.Only for the aficionados of the Japanese novel."
5,"Fantastic, haunting, compelling story","The "" literary"" merits of the work are well discussed elsewhere. What may not be appreciate is how compelling and ""readable"" this novel is. New to Kawabata, I read through it in a single setting , enthralled by the subtle artistry of the writer that combines with the moving story of forbidden love to produce a quietly devastating impact."
3,Falls short,"The style is very Japanese which means it's a bit sparse, a bit distant, a bit cerebral. Thousand Cranes is a story told through tea ceremony--in fact, an incredible portion of the book is dedicated to discussing the types of earthenware used in tea ceremony. If you don't know anything about Japanese tea ceremony, you could get a bit confused about why so much emphasis is placed on it in the story.When I finished, I felt let down. The imagery was beautiful, the emotions were real, but there was just something missing. The dialogue felt more like a play than like a novel (a problem with the translation, perhaps?), and the characters are (I'm sure purposefully) erratic and hard to pin down. While this could have been intriguing, the book was a little too short to make the effect anything but unfulfilling."
1,Worst possible book,The book repeats lots of things. Its not well written. Don't buy this book. You will fall sick reading this in a few days.
2,Two Dimentional Horse Story,"I was hopeful for this book, but found its content very two dimentional. The characters are written to feel and act like cardboard. It might be better suited for young teens (absent the less than interesting sex scene)."
4,Simple but elegant,"Frame looks perfect whereever I put it... next to black or white or brown. It's not showy, but it's beautiful."
1,Video should be called Boat Control For The Rich,"If you do not have thousands of dollars of disposable income, avoid this video. The video description promises to tell you how to stay on top of one fish. Instead, it is just an advertisement for state-of-the-art boat motors and electronics.I was expecting to see a live illustration of holding boat position (maybe with a little turbulance since you can't film in a monsoon). But, he just walked up and down his boat showing off all his fancy equipment."
5,Volumes of Information,"Bellydance Basics and Beyond deserves all of its 5 star reviews. I am 50 miles from the nearest dance class, and Jenna makes you feel like you're in her class. I have tried four DVDs by different instructors now, and she gives the most detailed breakdown of the correct way to perform dance moves. There is also a good section on footwork and layering dance moves with traveling steps, which some beginner DVDs lack. This is a great instructional DVD to have in your collection."
5,Great for this beginner,"This DVD breaks bellydancing down to its tiniest steps and then begins to build and combine them. I have never taken a dance class in my life, much less bellydance but it seems some practice with this DVD will give me confidence to try it in a more public setting. This is a very long DVD and I have not even made it past the first hour+ of steps and I am glad that the completed dances are still to come and that I will not have to make another purchase to further my learning."
4,"if you have ever been curious about belly dancing, this is a great dvd to start with!","i have danced for many years, but never bellydance, so i decided to try this dvd. this dvd is great, jenna is a great instructor, from the great variety of upper and lower body excersies to practice routines, she really walks you through every step. being a dancer, the most important part of this dvd is jenna stressing the importance of correct body posture not only for correct execution but also to avoid injury. anyone can enjoy this dvd, andi highly recommend it to anyone interested in trying bellydance or suppliment to a bellydance class."
5,Great for beginner!,"Great instruction for me as a beginner. She slowly explains the anatomy of each move and repeats slowly many times. She is standing in front of a large mirror when she explains the moves. This is great because one can see how her body is moving both front, back and side. She is an excellent teacher. For each move, she explains what not to do, also. That is to help you avoid injury. She covers posture, basic arm movement, shoulders, hips, circles, undulations, figure 8s, footwork and layered steps. Love this dvd."
5,This is the DVD I recommend to my beginning bellydance students!,"My beginning bellydance students always ask me which DVD I would recommend for them to use for practice, and I've finally found it! Jenna's Bellydance Basics and Beyond provides 2 hrs & 20 mins of of outstanding movement description and demonstration, explaining it slowly and precisely from the ground-up. Her emphasis and frequent reminders of safe and proper dance posture are to be commended! Thank you!"
2,Too mechanical,"Belly Dancing is supposed to be very fluid. Although this is a basic instructional video, it could use some improvement. For starter's the instructor's physique doesn't demonstrate the movements with definition or fluidity. She stands in front of a mirror panel with her back to you through most of the tedious 2.5 hours of instruction. The camera doesn't offer views from different angles or even close-ups. It could use a group type setting for the very moderate 25 min ""work out"". The instructor's verbal delivery is sometimes disjointed and lacks luster. I've plugged it in once and am not very motivated to use it again."
3,Detailed Instructional DVD,"I was looking to purchase an exercise video that features Belly Dance; however, I found this DVD to be more useful for those who want to learn the detailed steps to maybe perform for themselves."
5,Fun!,I love this DVD! It's got loads of stuff on it and it was an awesome price for all the information you get. It even has a warm-up that I love to do just about everyday.
3,"Technique, indeed","This DVD does give tips on developing proper technique. But for a beginner who is starting out, it may not keep your interest for too long.There is a lot of material here, but it's not set up in a way that is extremely engaging.It's more of an encyclopedia of moves, and how to do them. There isn't much repetition or drilling, you have to do it on your own.If you're more experienced and would like to work more on your basic moves, then perhaps this would be alright for you. But for a beginner starting out, it may prove to be a little boring. There really is no music during the tutorials.There is a short performance at the end, but its not really something you're building up to.This video doesn't have much of a ""fun"" factor to it, its more serious. If you're looking for that, then go for it."
4,Great instruction!,"If you are looking for a video that offers detailed instruction on specific moves, this is an excellent value. It is not a DVD for those seeking dance combinations. The production values are sparse - an unadorned dance studio is the setting and the lighting is a bit questionable, BUT the instruction is excellent. Well worth the money for those seeking to learn/improve technique."
3,"Great for ""returning"" older dancers...","30 years ago I was an advanced belly dancing student in Los Angeles who stopped lessons only because I felt pressure to ""get a job""! To me belly dancing was always more personal and spiritual than just that. Although I used the movements when I went Greek folk dancing (in some couples dances), I kind of lost touch with the solo aspect of the dance. Remember that there were no DVDs back then!Jenna's Bellydance Basics and Beyond: Technique for a Solid Foundation was heaven-sent for me. It proved to be a great way to stretch with warm-up exercises, review basic moves--safely, with comments about proper posture so that the dancer doesn't do injury to herself--and also to perhaps correct technical flaws."
4,A Fine BellyDancing DVD,"This is a fine Belly Dancing dvd for beginner Belly dancers. This works well for dancers who are not attending class or for dancers attending class. At the end of the video, you will be able to perform a dance. I give it four stars because it is very good, not the best, though very close."
2,No Music,"I was disappointed. This video has no music and is just specific instructions on each move. If you are looking to dance, this is not the right video for you. I was looking for a fun basic bellydance video, this was very dry step by step instruction with only the sound of her voice."
5,excellent for beginners,"This DVD is very good for true beginners. The instructor does a great job at breaking down the movements and teaching you how to do them safely and properly, so that you can progress in your technique. Highly recommend."
1,Waste of money,"I wanted to get into belly dancing and thought it looked like a good DVD, which it is I suppose if you just want a basic tutorial of the moves. That's all this DVD is. I was thinking it would have a routine or the moves would build on each other, but no such luck. All you get is shown individual moves. I did the workout once when I first got it and haven't used it since. I thought it was boring."
1,Didn't fit 2010 Toyota Tundra,"Slipped right off the filter. I'm sure I needed the 65 mm, the 67 is what i got.Next time, to the dealer. Too much of a pain to change these things with the skid plate and all."
1,Wrong bridge,This bridge was clearly not made for a violin but for a viola. It is too tall to fit a standard violin. We could not use it at all.
5,"This isn't just personal, it's also business","I met Wendy at a poets' workshop in Arkansas back in June 1996: her turf, not mine. Imagine me, a New York Jew whose marriage was headed toward the shoals forming an alliance with another middle-aged writer, in the middle of Wal-Mart country. She's just about the only person I kept up with from that week in northern Arkansas, and over the years we've exchanged writing and confidences. And now there's this book...and nothing prepared me for the power in it. All the ""reviewer words"" apply: serene, savage, beautiful. I read the title poem to my Significant Other the night the book arrived and when I was done I had unexpected and unwanted tears in my eyes. You don't read work this fine every day...which is why Wendy's writing stands out as clearly as Wendy herself."
3,The Bombshell Manual of Style,"Many quotes from famous beauties of past movie stardom. Many tips to emulate these stars. I am not sure how easy it would be for the average woman to do the things herein in this book, however, it is an interesting concept."
2,"Just for fun, not for the fashionistas","I purchased this book expecting a fun read....and yes, it is quite fun. However.....please.....ladies, do NOT purchase this book as some kind of 'style guide'. This is not about style and how stylish women dress. The last thing we need is for American women to look even trashier (no bra under your sweater to the office and fishnets during the day, indeed!). On a positive note, the book design and illustrations are just divine. Congratulations to the creative team. References to the old Hollywood starlets are both hilarious and inspirational......but I fail to understand the relevance of quotes by Patricia Arquette and Drew Barrymore! These ladies are hardly bombshell material. The fashion and beauty information is a little misguided (unless you're a drag queen) and the disparaging remark about redheads is just plain weird.THIS ONE IS STRICTLY FOR LAUGHS."
3,"3...2...1 Happy New Year! (1950, that is)","This book was very...amusing, sometimes comical. It's not for ""today's woman"" that's for sure. If I had to describe the book in one sentence it would be: ""If you want to be Marilyn Monroe or a helpless bimbo (or any other glamourous actress/sex symbol from that time)this is the book for you. I did enjoy the book, but I think it is due to the fact that I hold a certain nostalgia for the 1950s and the lifestyle described in the book. It is well written, easy to read, and made me laugh out loud several times. My favorite section was bombshell makeup and what a bombshell has in her bathroom, they actually list Ponds cold cream as a beauty must have! The only person I know that uses cold cream is my grandma! This is not a book for someone looking to be a lady, or a bombshell today, it's about how to be a bombshell 50 years ago."
3,Silly pink fluffy stuff,"The writers got stuck in a decade they probably didn't even live through -- the 1950s -- and so little of it translates to the 21st Century. They refer to the same few actresses over and over. Apparently the bombshell standard was set by women on screen and the setting for a so-called bombshell's life is a movie set. Then, the only contemporary actresses they feature are Marisa Tomei, Patricia Arquette and Kim Basinger, and I wouldn't place them all in the bombshell category. Sheesh. It took *how* many people to write this little bunch of fluff?"
2,Not much real advice,I think this is a fun idea but a quick read with no real advice. The bombshell stuff is a bit overdone. I much prefer How to Be Adored.
1,"Cute, but No Cigar","This book was... cute.It gave me a few... cute ideas.This book is not a manual. This book is a ""Hey, girlfriend! I bought you a gift!"" book.This is a ""I have nothing else to do, so I'm going to do some cute pleasure reading with this cute book"" book.So I give it 1 star.If you already know that this book is not supposed to actually help you live your life better, then get it. If you're looking for a manual of style, this is not it."
2,The Bombshell Manual of Style,I was disappointed. I was not stimulated nor informed. I would give this to my annoying sister who thinks that living on the edge is putting Bailey's in a milkshake.
4,From a guy's perspective...,This book was a god send. I found it hilarious as well as very telling about the gals I find myself attracted to. This book isn't supposed to be the bible of female chic style which other reviewers seemed to be looking for in it.
4,Fun and Oddly Freeing,"This book is a delight. I found it to be a delightful balance to ""A Year in Style,"" which I also really enjoyed, but left my inner bad girl just a teeny bit dissatisfied. The ""ideal woman"" in ""A Year in Style"" is just so, well, *perfect.* This book gave me permission to explore my wild side! Of course I do disagree with the authors occasionally -- this bombshell does enjoy French manicures, for example -- but it was the refreshing spirt of the book that really tickled me. Yea! It's fun to be a girl! All that political correctness out there can be oh sooooooo smothering sometimes. This book is a breath of fresh air."
3,Not as good as you might think,"I'm a sucker for these kind of books. I loved Swell, The Bad Girl's Guide to Getting What You Want and even found Three Black Skirts to be informative, though a bit preachy. I'm also a sucker for old movies. And I reluctantly admit that I am 65% Bombshell, but this book is totally unrealistic (hiking in heels?!). It hardly applies to modern life. There are only a few techniques I'd care to apply to my life (like keeping perfume and nailpolish in the refrigerator). This book could have been really funny, but it fell short. What I was hoping would be cute movie star advice ended up being a sort of extended profile of my favorite movie stars. And not even a very good profile. I really wanted to like this book, and I'm glad I have it for my collection, but I won't even lend it to my Bombshell girlfriends. A better and funnier book of this genre would be Miss Piggy's Guide to Life."
1,Not to be taken seriously,"When I purchased this book, I was looking for both a fun read and for something that I could apply to my life. This book fell short of both.I understand that it is not to be taken seriously. Still, I was disappointed."
2,Let's move into the 00's,"Cute book, but much more applicable to earlier generations. Maybe our mothers aspired to be Jane Mansfield, but I'd like to hear what Jennifer Lopez is doing. More modern comparisons and advice would be great for bombshells of the new generation. Better keep looking..."
2,"Good idea, but...","It could have been a lot better. If you buy a book like ""The Bombshell Manual"", you're expecting some light and fluffy reading. Well, good because that's what you're getting. There were some parts that I found interesting, but more parts that I found too long and tedious like the bombshell horoscopes. Yuck. And who says that redheads don't make good bombshells?"
3,Time for a more modern bombshell,"While I think this is a cute and witty book, I don't like how a previous reviewer mentioned ""intelligent but not at the cost of sensuality"". Intelligence has a great deal to do with sensuality. It also weeds out men a truly intelligent bombshell would not want to associate with. If my intelligence intimidates a man, that's his problem. Intelligence doesn't take anything away from sensuality. I really didn't dig the ""bombshells don't read Emerson, Thoreau, or T.S. Eliot"" and the ""bombshells don't like Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec"". Screw that. Three cheers for bombshells being domestically challenged! That's what I am! The illustrations were very cute as well."
3,"CUTE, but not amazing","I have decided to give this book to a great transvestite that I know. The book seems like a manual for a woman who does not know much and needs some schooling. The only problem is to be a Bombshell one shouldn't read a book, they should just be, but thats another story. This is light reading and meant for fun/rec purposes. Do not take this book seriously. It is adorable. One problem though (I DO LOVE DREW BARRYMORE), but Drew doesn't belong in this book. Granted she is great and beautious and all...but she is far too contemporary to be noted in the book. Get the book for fun facts, but don't see it as a guide to ultimate sex appeal."
3,Tickled Pink,"This book is great for light reading. This book gives some good advice such as having body confidence, always looking your best, and being as intelligent as you can be but I really wouldn't follow this manual very closely, for instance, would you wear high heels all the time or throw a tantrum? Overall, it's a fun read but not to be taken seriously."
3,A funny read but not so much information,"This is a very cute book. I recommend it for anyone who is interested in reading about bombshells, and confirm their prejudices:) It is a very quick read, and by reading it, one can delight in daydreams and fantasies about being The Bomb. It can also be used for educational purposes - it covers many areas of the life of a bombshell. It is important to note that this book focuses on the old school, not the new chic look.If you are looking for advice on how to actually becoming a bombshell, however, this is not the book to buy. Reading it is more like browsing through an entertaining magazine than actually reading a book, and there is not so much content. This is not a book that can be used practically; it can ""only"" be used as a nice distraction. I liked the chapter about different perfumes best. There are also a few hints about style as for clothing, but overall, this is a book for amusement and not for serious fashion (or other) advice."
2,Two stars for the illustrations,"Okay, I'll come right to the point. The best thing about Bombshell is the illustrations by Rueben Toledo. He's fantastic and the Toledo girls are cuter than cute. As for the book, read it but don't take it seriously. If you try to live like this you'll end up broke or dead. Actually, as I read I couldn't help but check off in my mind how the bombshell's the book holds as ideals ended up: Marilyn-- dead in rented room, Dorothy Dandridge--- dead on the bathroom floor, Rita Hayworth--- a lifetime of misery, Ava Gardner--- a really horrible, selfish woman, Jayne Mansfield-- dead on the road and at a low point in her career where Hollywood was laughing at her, not with her, Jean Harlow-- a victim of a nightmare marriage that may have led to her death at 26--- I didn't want to relate to any of this at all!Fashion wise, if you dress like a bombshell, expect to be called into HR or fired. It's just not a practical book. Cute but useless."
2,"Not bad, if you can stand the noise.","I was given one of these about a year ago, I tried it briefly and it's been collecting dust in my closet ever since. It does chill wine. In fact, it does it pretty well. Unfortunately, it also has inside it a loud fan which is always on. Picture a quiet evening for two, a candlelight dinner and this gizmo sitting nearby that looks like a miniature nuclear power plant cooling tower and sounds like a hair dryer and you can see the problem with this thing. It's just too darn noisy! Also rather ugly, imo. A more pleasant solution would be to keep the wine in one of those wrap-around gel packs for chilling wine that you keep in the freezer until needed."
3,Hamilton Beach wine chiller,It takes longer to cool that is advertised. It keeps the wine chilled fairly well. Thought it was a little too much to pay for what it does. If you are having a dinner party it would work well.
5,Great-fitting pair of jeans,"Between the dark color and the sleek fit, these are a really great-fitting, great-looking pair of jeans. Dressed up or down, they're definitely a favorite in my wardrobe."
5,Excellent fit and pocket placement,"I'm a definitive pear shape and the last few years of jean styles (the inexplicable strategic sanding....the curved cut in the hip that did double homage to the pear shape) have been infuriating for someone who just wants a straight cut pair of jeans that don't look like something your sister would wear in the puff paint glory days of 1987.These jeans were a very welcome surprise. They're a clean, straight cut along the hips and (I was very impressed by this) instead of trying to accommodate the back by making the front wider the designer has kept the cut of the front straight and shaped the back with a slight curve along the back seam. The result is a jean that is flattering in the front and actually fits in the back without making the rear look like a pancake or a close relative of the posterior-abusing ""mom jean."" A+."
3,The Jeans I received were not what was pictured!,"The jeans in the picture are the exact ones I have already and LOVE. So when I did a search to find a new pair I was excited to find them. Then I order them and the pair that was sent are different(quite disappointing!). The ones I received are even a longer long and don't fit quite so perfect as the pictured ones also the pockets are different I like the pictured ones better. I wish I had received the ones pictured. I know I could have returned them, but I needed a new pair and these are ok not great like the others."
4,Morgan conjures a deep melancholy mood,"Frank Morgan stacked this 1989 set with moody ballad interpretations, but as a bop-based player, he still finds plenty of opportunity to insert the quick little phrases associated with the style. Four tunes are taken as duets with George Cables on piano, a format that Cables' had explored in 1982 with Art Pepper in the final year of his life, and the results here are equally bittersweet yet rewarding. Buster Williams and Al Foster provide strong rhythmic support on the rest of the tracks, with Ronnie Matthews subbing for Cables on a couple of tracks. Wynton Marsalis sits in on trumpet on Coltrane's ""Bessie's Blues"" and Freddie Hubbard's ""Up Jumped Spring"", lending a broader sound to those tracks. A very satisfying set overall, if you're in the right mood for it."
3,Mixed Bag,"Having just dusted this off and listened to it again for the first time since it was released in 1989 I realized why I never gave it much attention in the first place. Morgan is an excellent player--he often reminds me of Art Pepper but with a touch of Cannonball Adderley, a near perfect combination for an alto saxophone player. Yet this album is marred by a poor choice of tunes ('Mood Indigo' itself is a dreadful bore no matter who records it, in my opinion), bad sound quality (the mix of instruments is off and it sometimes sounds as if Morgan is playing with a sock stuffed in his horn), overbearing trumpet courtesy of His Royal Majesty Wynton Marsalis, and ends with a short, heartfelt yet out of place monologue by Mr. Morgan. All in all, not a bad effort but nothing to write home about. It will go back in my collection and remain there untouched without being missed--probably forever."
3,Mood Indigo by Frank Morgan,"The title is better than the music. Morgan is an accomplished player but the accompanists are a bit old school: too much brass making more 'noise' than cool, slow jazz like the title implies.I cannot recommend this to friends who are also jazz lovers.B. Campbell"
2,"shipped fast, no weight specified","I received the shipment quickly; however, I was a little disappointed when I opened the box as it was only a 5 ounce package. I bought another color of sprinkles from a different company, paid the same price and got 16 ounces. The seller did not specify in the description how many ounces was included in the price. I took the risk because I needed the sprinkles and couldn't find them. I will know next time to ask the question before purchasing."
2,Very Disappointing,"I found this release very disappointing.Like the other reviewers, I found the sound quality awful, but my biggest disappointment was the exclusion of Marilyn's vocal rendition of the song ""Some Like It Hot"" that was released on a EP {extended play) when the movie first came out. Not only is it very rare {it turns up on some compilation Marilyn CD's}, but its also fun, and definately would have made this already short CD more complete and appealing. This movie soundtrack deserves better.{Added note: MGM did a superb job of their release of the soundtrack to ""The Misfits"", finding never before released music from the movie in their vaults and beautifully restoring it to an unbelievable sound quality. Surely they could do the same with ""Some Like It Hot"".??}"
3,in agreement,"I'm going to have to totally agree with the other reviewers here on the bad quality of the transfer to compact disc. While I love both the movie and all the music from Some Like it HOt, and I love listening to this, it doesn't sound very clear. It's like listening to a scratchy record.Maybe it needs to be remastered again? or is the best it can get?It is very good, a great ensemble of jazzy tunes that all were in the movie including all three of the songs MM sang: Running wild, I'm thru with love, and I wanna be loved by you.I like how some dialogue is thrown into the mix too. It's a fun soundtrack if you don't mind the quality of the sound."
3,"Not Deutsch's Best, but Worthy","Nice packaging in this one of a series of reissues from RykoPalm, who also gave us reissues of CARRIE and LAST TANGO IN PARIS. Per previous comments, there is some erosion of quality.If ANYONE AT RYKO IS LISTENING... would you please reissue ADOLPH Deutsch's great score for that other Wilder film, THE APARTMENT. That one had the hit theme, guys! And some sultry sweet jazz to boot."
4,Compelling and Personal,"This gritty account of the Battle of the Bulge doesn't pretend to tell a comprehensive story. You feel the cold, the fear, the anxiety of the attackers and rescuers alike, the cold, the deprivations of the prisoners, the confusion, the endless jockeying for power between the American and British high command and, again, the cold. But it's the personal stories of the young grunts that make the book a page turner. Even if you already know the details of this campaign, you won't want to put the book down until you finish.The author cuts through a slice of war that is personal and compelling, and he offers several insights that may be new to many readers. My only criticism: the military maps are atrocious for the untrained public. A few good, clear maps to orient all the activity going on would have been a great help."
3,"A short, pleasant, yet unimpressive Battle of the Bulge book.","The book is short. That might not say much about it, but brevity is its outstanding quality.I have read dozens of military history books, though most of the WWII books I have read were on the Pacific, non-Macarthur, theater. I knew the story of The Battle of the Bulge, though this was my first book on it.For the most part, what I liked was that it was a quick read. What I liked least was, there was little coverage on the parts of the battle that I knew about. It was really like reading an extended magazine article. Interesting enough, but unimpressive compared to most such books I have read."
3,Human perspectives on the Battle of the Bulge.,"A good human perspective of this famous Battle of the Bulge. The author gives some detail on the interactions between the various participates and we learn of Montgomery's arrogance, Patton's determination, Simpson, Hodges, and Bradley's less than stellar performance. The human interaction also shows in the level of the individual soldiers who surrender, hold on, and fight in poor weather in bad conditions. There were many mistakes in the battle, but the quality of the American soldier held true and the Germans did not get their breakthrough.This is a great book on the human perspective of the battle. Since there are other fine books about this battle, they probably rate higher but this is a good human interest read about this famous battle."
3,11 Days in December; Christmas at the Bulge 1944,"Mainly general broad knowlege of the Bulge. The most detailed accounts and the bulk of the book deal with allies commanders - Eisenhower, Montgomery, Bradley, Patton and the other major Allied commanders and their personal squabbles during the battle. On the German side most of the storyline deals with Hitler, Model, Rundstedt and their other major players and their strategic and personal problems. Most of the action describes strategic manueverings, so if you're wanting some good tactical storylines and peronal accounts from the front lines, this isn't the book for you."
4,Not Bad,"I have to say I like this album. Sure ""Hey Men"" is horribly emasculating, and I'm still trying to find out the purpose of the 21st Century Safety Dance, but outside of that the rest of the songs are as good as anything Men w/o Hats ever did. The title track is great, Eloise and I is one of the prettiest songs the Men ever did, and Here Comes the 90's takes me back to a great time in my life. So dispite the few shortcomings, this disc really is excellent and I would reccommend it to anyone who likes the Men."
4,Underated and overlooked,"Truly and example of how varied and polished a band can get. While ""sideways"" did leave fans a little underfed, ""Men & Women..."" is a full course.MWH has consistantly been a good pop band in the very truest sense of the word. This CD showcases lively songs, worldly thoughts, and insightful messages. Ivans voice is well rounded and is showcased in the prominent fashion it should be.My only word of caution is this: If you are getting this just for the Safety Dance remix - don't. It's an instrumental that leaves much to be desired. And is in all honesty, the sore spot on a rather lovely collection of music.Also... Ivan released a solo CD, that is simply put 'Proper pop' it's called ""the spell"". Check it out. It picks up where MWH's leaves off.. and then goes off on it's own path."
1,Incredibly horrible album by a once great band...,"Men Without Hats WERE a good band and are one of my favorite bands today, but this was just a really bad album. Up until this point they churned out nothing but gold, but this, along with the almost-as-bad Sideways, were just god awful. MWH is an electropop band... this ""album"" has nothing resembling that... The single Hey Men was a really bad choice in the sense that it's their worst song of all time... next to 21st Century Safety Dance (which isn't really a song, but 5 minutes of fake techno and children laughing... pointless? YUP!)... It's pretty bad when their ABBA cover is one of the higher points, since most everything else is completely forgetable! Even hardcore MWH fans hate songs like Underneath The Rainbow and Eloise and I (and it's ""intro"" which is yet another low point on the album). I really wish i could give TAOWAMWHITTC zero stars... 'cause that's what it deserves... CHA!"
3,This is not Men Without Hats' best work.,"It's pretty good, not no where near as good as Pop Goes the World. The cover of S.O.S. is neat."
5,Captivating,"This book is captivating from the get go. The name is very well chosen - it is the name the protagonist Katie uses for herself in cyberspace. The author has a fantastic way with descriptions and is drop dead hilarious. Her characters come alive and the plot is excellent. The reader empathises with Katie, who is filled with despair after her husband leaves her. She finds comfort in eating and balloons out even more. Then she seeks and finds some measure of comfort in the chat rooms of cyberspace. At the end of the story things are definitely looking up for Katie and since I'm a sucker for a good ending this was great.I do believe there are many people like Clarence walking around. Those who pay a lot of money with the promise of making so much more. They are taken in by scams time after time and just can't wake up.Watch out for this author!!!Also check out ""What Goes Around..."" and ""Beneath the Surface"" by Paula Aird."
3,"19 yr old Angelina, enough said","This movie was overall so-so. If you happen to catch it on cable tv, its worth a watch but I wouldn't sprint to the rental store to get it. On the other hand, I believe, this flick has Angelina Jolie's first nude scene (if your in to that then I DO suggest sprinting to the rental store). This movie seemed to substitute nakedness for violence throughout. Both movies in the cyborg series are practically unrelated so if you've missed the first (I highly recommend you see it though) you wont be out of the loop..."
4,Nice surprise!,"Cyborg II, sounds like some 2nd-rate movie. Is not. Not at all! I was surprised by the very, very nice 'ambiance' this movie has. Good looking, convincing surroundings, good sound. It has even a nice (though somewhat unsurprising) story with nice characters. For me, 'Blade Runner' sets the standard for this kind of movies (and this title was not even remotely challenged by this movie), but in some aspects, most notably the overall ambiance and 'sadness' this movie comes close. Let's call this movie very, very acceptable..."
2,Poor Baby ...,"1993R: Guess everyone's gotta start somewhere in SciFi, but this isn't one of Angelina's best (by far). Action and Drama are her genre's ... even Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is better. Fortunately she ROCKED just 2 years later in Hackers - a sorta IT/SciFi geek cult classic. MFJlabs 2x"
5,Angelina Jolie's start...,"The header says it all; if you follow Angelina's film career like I do, I recommend you get a copy of her early work here while its still available and inexpensive."
3,Worth watching for sci-fi and Drago fans,"Billy Drago's (Takeover, Delta Force II) movie career dates back to the 1980's. If you admire his portrayals as the obsessive psychotic bad guy, then you must add this movie for your viewing pleasure. He does share air time with high-visability actor Jack Palance (City Slickers and a portrayer of many a great bad guy himself) and Angelina Jolie (showing some bare breasts in this her first film role) and Elias Koteas (Prophecy) so Mr. Drago's air time is limited. But his character displays the subtle phychotic role that he has perfected over the years making him a fascinating bad guy. This cameo role has shades of his chilling character Frank Nitti in ""The Untouchables."" Enjoy!"
2,NOT WIDESCREENED,Strictly for Angelina Jolie fans of which I am one. Please note that this DVD is not widescrened although I'm sure the theatre version was.
2,Weak effort,"The action is pretty lame in this sequal, which is too bad because the film starts off well. The introduction by Palance and the idea of waring robotics companies is good, but the delivery blowed."
1,Garbage,"It is a bad, substandard, under founded movie. Poor script. Terrible DVD quality. And it has nothing to do with the first Syborg."
2,scooby pillowcase,pillowcase was cute BUT the material has white spots all over where the coloring on the material didn't stick.
5,Enjoyable,"I really enjoyed reading this book on Boxers. I am researching dog breeds before I commit to a new family member. There was a careful balance of enthusiasm for the Boxer and warnings of their specialized needs AND the responsibilites of Boxer ownership.I especially enjoyed the observations he made between male and female boxers, puppy training, and problematic behaviors.Even if I don't decide to own a Boxer in the future, this was an entertaining educational read that I would recommend to all."
2,"got a great beat, but ya cant dance to it","The plot is definitely there, but I was not enthralled by the writing style. Too many things were repeated. Phrases, thoughts, cliches, and subplots. I got the feeling that this story was written quickly with very little reworking for clarity. Beyond that, the story was enjoyable, if not predictable. It just requires that you look past all the redundancies."
2,I HAVE TO AGREE ...,"I have to agree with some of the others, this book was far from Georgina Gentry's better works. Although I liked the heroine, Emma, I could not feel the same way for the hero, Rider. I found him obnoxious and down-right disgusting at times. I never felt like I was reading a real love story. Had this not been by one of my favorite authors, I would have not finished it. The secondary characters were also obnoxious and rude and I could not find anything to like about them. I have read almost all of Ms. Gentry's books and this one is at the bottom of the list. It definitely is NOT a keeper!"
3,Warrior's Heart,"This book is blah. Sometimes the plot is boring, repetitive and convuloted. I definitely have read better (Dorothy Garlock's books come to mind). The storyline doesn't have any flow and even though it is ""pulp fiction"" I expected better from this author."
3,"Anecdotal and entertaining, but limited.","This book would probably be a lot of use to a writer or screenwriter who was researching the working-class family in the early 70s. The stories are interesting and the writing is fluid and compelling. It gives a good slice of life from several perspectives.It *might* be of interest to a historian as anecdotal material, but it's good to note that this is a small sample of interviews carried out by a writer who obviously had her own agenda with the subject matter.I bought it second-hand and don't regret the time to read it."
1,Lack of Perspective,"As interesting as this book was, Rubin failed to distance herself and her own biases from the writing. If one reads between the lines, what we get here is an author who has alterior motives. I'd like to know what her positions are on Socialism, Marxism, and Communism. She tries to be cryptic but the careful reader will discover what Rubin's really up to.Finally, this book is dated. It has lost most of its validity, and unless one wants this book soley to understand the time it was done, it has very little place in current working-class family evaluation."
4,Pretty Color,I love the nail polish brand but I was a little disappointed that the color wasn't what I was hoping for. It's darker than I expected but I like it none the less.
1,wrong color,hate it!!! wrong color.. the color looks like its pinkest but it turns out its completely purple. be careful some pictures isn't what you think it is...
3,color not as pictured,"I received my order in a timely manner...the problem is that it was much more purple than pictured, and not an option for me. Upon searching the OPI web sight i discovered that it more resembled a color called Funky Dunky (though the label reads A Grape Fit) I have contacted the seller,( 3 days ago) and have not gotten a response. Disappointed....... but still hoping to hear from them."
2,O.P.I.'s My Private Jet Nail Lacquer.,"We wanted the My Private Jet that was charcoalish/black with the rainbow hue, but we got several bottles of the brownish shade. It's definately NOT what we wanted. Please bring back the original color. We won't be buying anymore of the brownish shade. Rita Norton & Donna Levi. Since reviewing other customer complaints with this product, we would think that marketing & merchandising would take heed of our warnings."
1,NAIL POLISH BRUSH HAS FLY AWAY BRISTLES!!!!,"I don't know about any of you who likes new nail polish to come with a neat brush. but when i opened the nail polish, OMG bot, was i disappointed. all of the bristles has fly away hairs, and i had no choice to cut some of them, in order for it for the bristles on the nail polish brushOPI That's Berry Daring Nlb36 - Nail Polish / Lacquer / Enamelto be neat. omg, now i have nail polish on my scissor, and a messed up nail polish brush. NEVER AGAIN THIS COMPANY!!!!"
3,Looking for some freshness ?,"- My skin tone is between medium and light, and I think it will be also beautiful on tan or darker skin- BEAUTIFUL color, such a calm lovely yellow like some delicious corn :)Though the name "" Fiona "" suppose to be more like Shrek's wife! ( I saw some old pics showing that color but maybe they change the formula , and actually that old color became "" Who the Shrek are you ? but a little darker ""- If you have ever seen "" one star "" as a rate for it, it's absolutely because of the thin annoying formula that requires 3 coats ( I felt disappointed at first because I'm always in a hurry )Anyway, the result makes you forget all that drama <3Hope my review helps you to decide ;)"
1,never receive this item!!!,"I ordered 11 polishes from NailEtc, only received 5 in the parcel. This one is one of the missings. I was so looking forward to this one, which made me soooooooooooooooo disappointed. But I got my refund at the end."
2,Not teal,"I love OPI products and when I realized I could buy them from Amazon for less than $9 a pop, I was excited. This is the only polish I have ever ordered that I was not satisfied with. The name of the product is ""Teal the Cows Come Home"" and the color looks to be a greenish/teal color. When the bottle arrived, it was very, very blue. I have not worn this product since I purchased it."
3,OPI -Teal the Cows Come Home,"I bought this thinking it was a matte color instead of a shimmery, pearly teal. It's a nice color and covers pretty well, but it wasn't what I was expecting or what I prefer at all."
5,My Private Jet,Love love love this color. Perfect for the fall and winter. It has little specs of silver kinda looks like graphite. My favorite color.
3,Ehh,"I love Opi, not this OLov. It's a pearly blackish bray with flecks of glitter. I was shocked how it looked painted because it seemed cute. Same good Opi quality"
4,OPI A Grape Fit Nail Polish,"Couldn't find this polish until I found it on Amazon. It was delivered on time and I love it,love it.I have gotten so many compliments.I can always count on amazon. thank you"
4,OPI Up Front and Personal nail polish,"This is a lovely light color with a gold sheen to it. I wanted a color like I'd seen on the actress Alison Sweeney, which looked like a milky white with a gold sheen. I had to guess at it because I don't know her color, and this isn't exactly like I'd hoped but pretty doggone close. As always, OPI doesn't disappoint in the wearability and ease of application."
3,On the same Paige - orange polish,I was disappointed that the color shown on the picture is not what I got. I wanted BRIGHT orange like the photo but instead the color is a darker rust color.
5,Perfect pink,I'm very picky when it comes to pink polish but I adore this color. It's not too shockingly glittery or too bright pink. It's perfect for just about every outfit and occasion. It's a great color.
5,LOVELY AND UNUSUAL!,"I definitely agree with the other reviewers. I just recieved my bottle of My Private Jet today, and it really IS amazing. It is a dark gray with an amazing iridesence- a virtual rainbow of colors! It's not gothic at ALL. I think this is my new favorite shade as well! OPI is the BEST!"
3,The color is ok...,"I am pleased with the turn around time of receiving this product, I got it within 4 days of purchase and it was in great condition. However, I am not too crazy about the color, it has a bit of a brown base to it and I was expecting more of a black background, it's good to wear for special events, not an everyday color for me..."
2,UGLY COLOR..not what expected!!,"Before i purchased this color, i went online & checked it out. From the pics that i saw, i LOVED it! It was sooo unique & pretty! When i recieved mine..NOT so much!! I was so disappointed & mad! From what i've read of other reviews, apparantly OPI changed the color from the original one. That was not smart because this one looks NOTHING like the original. The glitter in it is not nearly as bright & rainbow colored & the base color is a mucky, dirty looking brown! I gave mine away."
5,Killer color,"Needed something that wasn't some awful neon, screaming red or bubble gum pink. This is great. I can use it as a stand alone or mix it. Lasts about the same as other polish, but I use a coat or 2 of Sally Hansen as base and top coat."
5,perfect colors,I have looked for a long while to find the perfect pinks. These two colors are just perfect and look so good. And being OPI they stay nice for a long time.
2,not what I expected,"It's not the color I expected, but it's ok I will wear it to see how much I like it"
1,not worthy buying,"The edition is unedited, with no introduction, and without notes of any kind. Shakespeare texts, to be worth buying, need notes, at a minumum those that elucidate difficult words, of which there are many in Shakespeare, 29000 by one count. The absence of notes should have been in the book's description. Michael Platt, Professor of Politics, Philosophy, and Literature, George Wythe College"
3,"Great photos, but ...","This book has great pictures and is good for a beginning aquarist, but it really doesn't have a lot of information specific to platies. I wanted a bit more platy-related info. Again, very nice photos, though."
5,Flexible and compact,"The Maxell adaptor is an excellent product. The locking pivot feature makes for an easily adjustable fit that stays where you position it, and the accessable inline fuse is a nice plus. More compact than my previous adapter."
3,"Works well, but picky with plugs","I purchased this item to enable my mother to operate her GPS navigator and massage seat simultaneously. There was no issue with the former, but the latter's plug wouldn't stay in; immediately upon insertion, it would pop right out.I noticed that the plug in question differed from most, and it evidently fell outside this unit's tolerances (despite being compatible with the bare cigarette lighter port).Fortunately, I was able to buy a new DC adapter for the massage seat (with a conventionally styled plug) from RadioShack. There have been no problems since then, but it was disappointing to have to spend roughly double the amount that I anticipated."
1,Poor outlet connector,Unfortunately this product has poor outlet jacks. Any thing I plug in it pops out. I think its not deep enough or locking ring.
1,Doesn't really work for me,"I bought this item because I wanted it fit tightly in the power outlet. It does. I wanted to use it to plug in my SIRIUS Satelite Radio. I get no electrical connection to the radio while holding the plug in. When I release the pressure on the plug it pops back out about 1/4"". I really wish that I could use this thing. It's a good thing it didn't cost very much."
2,"Fits Very Snugly in Outlet, But Doesn't Work!","Summary: We drive a 1998 Honda CRV and we were trying to power two DVD players from the front cigarette lighter. Didn't work for us, disappointed.Didn't think it actually fit at first, but we got the adapter into our outlet with some effort. Unfortunately, it didn't work when trying to power two different DVD players. I don't know if it's just too much for the system or what -- but I would have the first DVD player up and running and when I plugged in the second DVD player the first would stop working and the second wouldn't work at all."
1,UNABLE TO MAKE IT WORK,I BOUGHT THIS ITEM FOR USING IN MY HONDA CAR. BUT I AM NOT ABLE TO GET POWER. I CONTACTED THE SELLER. HE IS NOT GIVING ANY PROPER ANSWER RATHER BLAMING ME. AND ALSO HE IS NOT WILLING TO TAKE IT BACK. SO I JUST STUCK WITH THIS ITEM AND UNABLE TO RETURN BACK.
1,Not worth the money,I wouldn't recommend this product. The device plugs don't stay in the sockets. I have had bad luck with this one and would not purchase it again. The previous one I bought from Radio Shack was better.
2,Ok product but did not last for me,I liked this a lot in the beginning but the construction is not all that great and in less than 6 mos it died - would not buy again. also bit bulky in the car.
4,Dual Auto Power Adapter,This adapter functions well and is good quality. The only draw back is limited acceptablity when the car's outlet is in the console in front of a manual stick shift as on my 2002 VW Jetta. In my case it nearly eliminates access to one outlet.
2,can't hold onto power plugs,"I was looking for a car Y adapter for the cig lighter so I could hook up a radar detector and a GPS unit. This seemed to fit the bill, however the adapter doesn't hold the plugs too well and both small and large plugs would pop out of the adapter. Sometimes plugs would pop out of the adapter from the car hitting bumps in the road or whatever and it would disconnect devices. All in all, not exactly what I was looking for as it could not get a secure grip on the power cables plugged into it."
1,wast of money,So disappointed. I did my research and read reviews on this product. I was taking a 1300 mile trip (CT to FL) with my family and needed it for a few TV's for the kids and our phone charges. Some of the plugs wouldn't stay in and it popped the fuse half way down to FL. All the time i spent researching and getting this for my trip and it was a total waste.
3,"good, but...","My requirements for this product were relatively simple. I have only one lighter outlet, but need to power 2 devices. The problem i encounter is that the adapter does not allow the 2 power plugs to stay firmly seated in it, so that the devices are only intermittently powered. If this were remedied, since it is inexpensive and would then serve it's purpose well, it would earn a 5 rating."
3,3 amp fuse,It has a 3 amp fuse which means you cannot run anything over 36 watts. Most car lighters are on 15 amp circuits so this wastes 12 amps of capacity.
1,Doesn't work,"Tried this product in 4 cars - Acura TSX, Audi, Oldsmobile mini van and Saturn SUV. The only car it fit was the Saturn which unfortunately was my brothers car. So basically this was a waste of money. I thought this would be a standard product to fit a standard socket but apparently not."
4,Great purchase,This was a great purchase i'm trying to learn the Levantine dialect in Arabic and this book helps a lot! The dvd is great because listening practice helps you pick up the sounds and i enjoy this book!
4,"One Woman Sharing Her Experience, Strength and Hope!","This book took me on a journey through the mind of one woman sharing her cycle in postpartum depression. From the beginning of this book, the author shared her stages of darkness, isolation, anger, intrusive thoughts, fear, suicide thoughts, childhood memories, shame, guilt etc...I admire her courage for allowing the public to see into her mind!"
5,Uplifting,"This is a great book to give as a gift, especially for someone who is ill or down and out.The stories deal with everyday life, but focus on the good, humorous side of life, allowing readers to refocus and see the good in their own lives.This book is entertaining for both young and old."
4,Business insights for gentiles,"As a business editor, I've pretty much seen it all when it comes to advice for company managers and leaders. But this book offers something truly different: new ways to apply values that have been in practice, honed and refined, for 1,500 years. And while you'll obviously get the most from this book if you're a practicing Jew, there's a huge bonus here for gentiles like me. The stories and lessons are far more specific than anything we can discern from the vague background hum of Judeo-Christian values in business today. If you want solid spiritual guidance that you can take to work every day, this book is for you. Besides the rabbis, you'll learn a little bit from everybody, from Mark Twain to Deutsche Bank to diamond dealers. So, go for it. You'll like it."
5,"Business Lessons for anyone, anytime","The Jewish people have had a collection of wisdom -- the Talmud -- that has guided and shaped their business and personal lives for generations. Larry Kahaner does an excellent job of extracting and putting into modern-day context ten basic lessons in the Talmud that are as timeless as they are timely. Clear, succinct, and easy to read, this book makes a compelling case for the wisdom of living your business life and your personal life as one, guided by the time-proven principles of respect, fairness, and charity. After reading this book, I found it easier to make day-to-day decisions by asking myself, what would the Talmud tell me to do? My decisions and actions have become surprisingly simpler, sounder, and more direct. This is not just a guide to business. It is a guide to life."

4,Strong Quincy Jones Arrangements,"This import release includes two selections on a single disk. Quincy's arrangements soar, and it is easy to see why he was in such demand at this time. I particularly like the ""In the Heat of the Night"" release, where Quincy's arrangements showcase his command of dynamics, with Ray Charles's wailing lead vocals."
5,Excellent Clamp,"Great Clamp, works like it should. If you haven't used a good parallel cabinet clamp, treat yourself to a pair!"
4,New Jet Parallel Clamp,"The new Jet Parallel Clamp system works great. I have had the Bessey Clamp for many years and like them very good, at one time that was the only Parallel Clamp on the market. But now you have more to pick from.I think the new Jet Clamp will make Bessey look up and take notice. This New Jet Clamp will make Bessey rethink how they got into the clamp field.Tom McCranie"
4,Intriguing portrait.,"An intriguing portrait of a sweet, starstruck, young woman and the tragic downward spiral of her life from which she is eventually unable to extricate herself. Surprisingly, she was romantically linked to both Bob Dylan and Andy Warhol, two extremely different yet both very influential cultural and artistic celebrities. Excellent acting, casting, screenwriting, directing, and editing, in a true story that provides interesting insights to Dylan and Warhol's personal lives in addition to revealing the story of Edie Sedgwick, someone about whom I previously knew nothing. Bought this DVD for someone else. Watched it because I'm a fan of movies, art, and Bob Dylan. Liked it more than I expected to."
4,"Art, drugs & poor little me","Rich girl goes dead via drugs, sound familiarHmmm ...If you're into the late '60s early '70s scene, this movie takes you on a fantasy tour with Andy Warhol as your tour guide.No, my name isn't Johnson.;)This movie isn't shy to expose TNA, drugs, homosexuality or dysfunctional families.It's interesting, but that's about it."
