1,I give to this ZERO stars!!!!,"If i could i will give ZERO stars to this terrible mistake! The ways of the planet brings a lot of problems to the earth citizens....In Brazil we got a terrible plague called SERTANEJO...It's really lame and shows a complete lack of attitude! Also, the songs sound exactly the same and the lyrics are embarassing! I mean, look to this crap Zeze di camargo e Luciano...They are the example of Sertanejo! If i could change the world, i will delete these mistakes, like SERTANEJO, PAGODE and AXÃ‰..."
4,Good Coat for the money,Coat looks great. Coat Feels silky smooth. Great leather for the money. The front buttons look a little fragile so I have avoided buttoning them (Hasn't been cold enough to button yet anyway). All in all no problems with it so far.
2,Beautiful Looking But (Maybe) Not Well Made,"I have been looking for this style of coat for quite some time. Ordered it and waited eagerly for it to arrive. When I opened the box and tried the coat on, I was very pleased. I wore the coat a total of about 1 day when the stitching on the top button failed and I noticed a tear developing on the left side of the button hole. Luxury Lane quickly authorized a return, that I am presently processing (just finished boxing the item); but, I am very disappointed and am unsure if I will reorder. Could have been a fluke thing, but I tend to think that you get what you pay for, and this is very reasonably priced for its size."
2,Didn't stick to and very short,I use alot of 7th gen products including ultrathin pads. So I thought the pantiliners would be just as good. But the adhesive strip just didn't stick and it would bunch up and fold to stick together or stick to me. Also I thought they were short and kinda thick for a pantiliner. I returned them.
5,Great price and product!,After reading the reviews I purchased these component velocity cables. A1Books mailed them immediately. I am very satisfied with their service and product.I noticed the picture quality immediately.I am glad I did not spend $40 to $100.00.
3,Spendy ... but necessary,"God bless technology. With the new (for now) HD Digital age, I now have a drawer full of obsolete cable connections. Having said that, if you've gotta have them, these are acceptable. My only complaint: it took forever for these doohickeys to arrive."
2,NOT WHAT IT SEEMS,"Greatest Hits 1957 is not what it seems. Yes, there are plenty of hits here minus any heavy hitters from the likes of Elvis or Jerry Lee Lewis. What you do get are ""alternate"" versions of these songs. I believe only a couple here are even original release and several of the songs on this disc are not even from 1957. ""Mountain of Love"" was from 1960, ""Yakety Yak"", ""Endless Sleep"", and ""Rebel Rouser"" are all from 1958, to just to name a few.Unless you are into alternate versions of classics, Buyer Beware!"
4,Good Characters and Story.........,"I really enjoyed this book. Pizzey's characters are easy to get involved with - the story is different and kept me interested all the way through. This is not a mushy love story - the love interests are very realistic and easy to identify with. I have recommended this to friends, which I don't always do."
3,Heads up!,"Just a little heads up for those interested in this disc. Toonzone is reporting that WB plans on doing box sets of BTAS (both series) at some point in the future. Also, Columbia House is currently releasing all of the episodes on DVD (6 per disc). 10 discs are reportedly available. No extras on the CH version. The video transfer is supposed to be id to the WB transfer. Choose wisely!"
5,"""VIVA ARSENIO""- Arsenio Rodriguez & His Conjunto","""Viva Arsenio"" was a compilation that up until now,was one of the hardest to find of several stateside, New York City, recordings by the great late cuban composer and musician Arsenio Rodriguez, a.k.a. ""El Ciego Maravilloso"" (""The Marvelous Blindman"") as he was and is still called. ""Viva Arsenio"" was probably the last or one of the last recordings Arsenio Rodriguez made here in New York City before relocating to Los Angeles or Southern California, where he died during the early 1970's. This recording like all the ones he made throughout his entire career is like a uniquely rare, high quality vintage wine. The reproduction of the original album artwork and its color photograph of Arsenio are also unique, just like the album contents, which I am sure you will enjoy. Do not miss this long overdue but enlightened re-issue of this rare, but not forgotten recording by Cuba's maestro and foremost tres and guitar player, the late Arsenio Rodriguez."
4,At Last: A Science Fiction Book With Science,"I am often bemused by customer reviews that criticize a science fiction book because it has science in it. This is the type of book that a lot of ""science fiction"" fans won't like: It contains some actual, fairly believable science; it takes place in the present; it is not a space opera. Twistor uses the concept of a shadow universe to provide us with a most interesting thriller. If the modest amount of science is over your head you can safely skim through it.My only annoyance was with the fairy tale that the protagonist told to two children in stages throughout the book. While I can grasp the author's intent in telling it, I didn't like the plot interruption. All in all a most worthy book."
4,Thoroughly enjoyable,"My search for this book was a long one. I first learned about the author and his book when I downloaded a computerized periodic table for the Macintosh written by John Cramer. (It was a Hypercard stack, I believe.) It was freeware that, incidentally, advertised his book Twistor. I put the book on my mental ""to buy"" list but it was YEARS before I spotted a copy on a bookshelf. (Still a first printing. Go figure.)What goes around comes around, though, and I did wind up ""paying"" for Cramer's excellent periodic table with my purchase of his book. Meanwhile it's a fine book, a thoroughly well crafted hard science fiction tale with a little mystery and fantasy thrown in. Highly recommended to fans of ""good old SF"" -- like me! And infinitely more deft than, say, Crichton's recent expedition into vaguely similar territory."
4,Twistor--Good ride.,"I was surprised by Twistor...The cover promotes it as a ""hard science fiction"" book, which I like and looked forward to reading. However, this book is NOT hard in the sense that it is a thoroughly enjoyable book. It drew me in nearly as well as many of my other favorite authors' work. The ""hard"" science is truly deep, but well explained, while the story is rich and visual.I also highly recommend Cramer's other book, ""Einstein's Bridge""."
2,It's fun.. until the last few pages,"It's fun to read, except that I feel the author was trying too hard to impress the readers [me] by writing lots of stuff in jargon.. like I'm really interested in those [?].. I mean, a simple explanation will suffice and I'm pretty sure I'll get the idea, he didn't have to tell me the nitty gritty details, it's frustrating to read such a long paragraph when all he needed to say was that this does this.The ending really disappointed me. I wish the lead character and his partner thought twice before coming to that [terrible] decision, coz you know.. the invention they got in their hands could really mean trouble if bad guys have access to it.."
1,Yikes! Cover The Kids' Eyes!,"I would rather go without Novocaine while getting my teeth pulled by an angel-dusted monkey using a Phillips screwdriver, than watch this schlock. This film centers on an implausible kidnapping, and a load of ""filler material"" at the beginning of the film, that features the protagonist protecting an African Princess whom he must protect but is more concerned with bedding.The acting here and the badly choreographed karate fight scenes make""Dolemite"" look like ""Enter The Dragon."" Truly hammy acting and badediting make this film a must-see for burgeoning directors and editors so that they will know what NOT to do when creating an action film.As in a lot of second-rate blaxploitation, the innuendo and nudity isheavy. The dialogue is so corny, you suspect that black people hadlittle to do with it. Cookie cutter characters make this a really poor man's version of ""Shaft,"" meaning this film is a bad (horrific)mutha....I know, hush my mouth!"
5,"Kicker Comp 15""","Bought 2 of em for $80 each and they pack one heck of a punch for 250/500 Watts RMS, not costly and if you are looking for bang for the buck, these are the way to go."
4,"kicker comp c15 15""","Go two of these in my 1988 town car in a ported box, sound great, actually puts my kenwood amp to work that it overheats and turns off, so its a shame that i cant push as much as I'd like."
5,Jonell will Amaze you,"What can I say this little lady has a voice as soft as silk and as hard as nails all at the same time. She is what Janis Joplin was trying to be. I agree with the first reviewer that she should sing more blues stuff it really is where she shines, but the plain simple truth is this little lady is amazing. She can just flat sing. She put's as much feeling and emotion into her songs as anyone I have ever heard. This CD is a must for all Jonell fan's. If you have not had the opportunity to enjoy this lady, you will not be disapointed. Fabulous CD buy it now. Also if you want to hear more of the soulful side of Jonell the ""About Townes"" CD is a must have, not a bad song on it.T.C."
1,This book has nothing to do with JBuilder,"I bought this book because I wanted to learn about JBuilder 3, but this book does not touch on what it is supposed to do - JBuilder. The first few chapters of this book are junks. The rest of the book is about Java but not JBuilder. If you want to learn Java there are many books better than this one; and if you want to learn JBuilder this book is completely useless. The title is deceptive and I returned the book."
1,Awful book. Save yourself some time and money.,"I was very excited to hear about this book. Unfortnatly, after reviewing this book, I found many errors. I'm returning this book today. There are screen shots that are from previous versions of Jbuilder. In one section they ask you to use JDBC explorer but all of the screen shots are for SQL Explorer which doesn't ship with JB3 anymore. That's just to name a few. This book could easily be cut in half and still be considered a book on JB3. There are filler chapters on OO programming and concepts as well as chapters on Java programming. Save yourself some time and money. Read a good general purpose book on Java and then read the manuals that ship with JB3. You'll be much better off."
3,Havn't read very far,"I am a software engineer who is killed in C and Delphi4 and some knowledge of C++. I want to jump in onto Java really quick. I Just bought the book and haven't read very far. The first three chapters just doesn't touch the real programming staff at all. If it's not a beginner's book, why does it explain so much about like why Java is a good language for OOP? And I don't find the Part II ""Design and team development strategies"" useful at all.btw, which Java book is good at basic Java Language and java OOP?"
1,Beginners don't bother,"This book is just plain awful. I bought this book hoping to use my knowledge of Java in the JBuilder IDE, but that isn't what I got. This book just plain sucks. Nothing on how to use JBuilder, no tutorials on JBuilder, nothing. This book mainly covers intermediate to advanced Java programming topics, so JBuilder beginners beware of this book! It is too bad that I don't need this book anymore even though I bought the book hoping to learn something."
1,"All ""Unleashed"" books are awful",This book stands as a testament to the fact that all of Sam's Unleashed series of books are not worth the paper they are printed on.
2,You are better off with a Home Depot book!,"I usually like the TV program and after watching an episode where Debbie transforms an old door into a beautiful headboard I wanted to buy the book to follow up on the idea. However the book is more of a portfolio of Debbie's work. Sadly the project I'm interested on only takes one page, very brief directions amd doesn't show the before and after. The step by step instructions are very simple, you need to be knowledgeable of the matter to be able to do anything. I would hope from books of this sort more trick and tips of the trade."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with this book and also with Debbie's Painted Kitchen book. Both are heavy on her commentary & light on how to do's. Plus I didn't think that many of the ideas were very original or creative. If you just want to read commentary that sounds very much like her on her HGTV show, these books are for you. For great ideas, save your money."
1,DON'T BOTHER,I HAVE THIS VACUUM AND I WASTED MY MONEY. DO NOT WASTE YOURS. IT WILL HARDLY PICK UP ANYTHING. DO NOT BUY.
5,Excellent reference book,Well written reference book for B&S collectors. However it did not include the pattern I collect so sent it back. Nothing wrong with this book.
4,Just an approach to classical music,"The disc wasn't released for Jazz lovers. It is a collection of beautiful classical pieces played with little (sometimes without) improvisation, respecting the melodies and its harmony. I would only recommend this disc if you are a Grusin/Ritenour fan and like classical music. You will surely spend a great time listening the tracks, any time you are in the mood to listen some Bartok, de Falla or Bach."
4,Jazz Fanatics are just tooooooooo cool!,"There's nothing like the pompous opinion of a Jazz elitist that serves quite as well for being a reverse barometer for something I'll be inclined to enjoy. No wonder Jazz suffers from such little wide-spread acceptance in this country when those who claim to be fans are so quick to criticize anything that either doesn't fall under the highly interpretive definition of it or ventures into other realms. Is this a Jazz album? NO! Is this a Classical album? NO! Is this an album of well-performed classically-influenced music that is pleasing to listen to and doesn't make you feel as if you're being stabbed in the forehead with an ice pick? YES! By the way, Dave Grusin is the pianist, not Bob James!"
3,Kept my interest. Enjoyable way to pass the time if you don't expect too much. The negative: it ended too soon.,"My main complaint is not knowing what happened to various characters at the end. But the rest is good. This author is a good writer and she does suspense well. Although there is a little bit of romance at the end, don't read it for romance. Read it as a suspense story with interesting characters. It's about 1/2 the length of a regular novel.The narrator Enid Graham is a new favorite of mine. Her voice is pleasant, calming, comforting, and good.DATA:Narrative mode: 3rd person. Unabridged audiobook reading time: 6 hrs and 35 mins. Swearing language: strong. Sexual language: none. Number of sex scenes: 2. Setting: current day Texas. Book copyright: 2000. Genre: suspense with a little romance."
4,Pretty good,"A pretty good book, in line with the other Sandra Brown books I've read. Maybe a little short on character and plot development, but you get into it enough to dismiss that as a minor fault. Recommended for Brown fans!"
2,Disappointed.,"I was disappointed in this book for several reasons. First, I felt there was too many characters, which made everything feel rushed. Secondly, the characters weren't developed enough for me. It was especially hard to believe that the two main protagonists would fall in love in the end since there wasn't any sustantial emotional connection between throughout the book. I have enjoyed many Sandra Brown books in the past, but this was not one of them. The premise was good, but the story just didn't grab me."
3,Pacy and entertaining,"(...) It's a pacy little tale about a pair of runaway teenage lovers,holding up a store and holding a group of people at gunpoint. A zillion years ago,this would have been made into a ""B"" grade movie by someone like Republic pictures as a good little filler-in.I agree that the last few pages seemed like the obligatory sex scene but some readers like this bit and--hey--to each his own!! I found it to be entertaining,fast,quite exciting and a good little ""filler-in""story."
1,"Did Sandra ""REALLY"" write this!",I have read every Sandra Brown book there is clear back to her Loveswept days. She has stated in interviews that she is going to write romantic/suspense books. Alot of people are upset that she hasn't stayed with her regular basic romance books. I could expect Standoff to be a first book but not one by an author as established as this one... I started to be interested in the young couple involved in the stand off but as the book went on I couldn't have cared less. As far as romance in this book....she seemed to have just thrown everything together ....in about 20 pages! It bothers me when authors try to wrap everything up in the last page or two. Really felt like I was left hanging! I'm starting to wonder about alot of the more popular authors. Are they under some kind of time constraint and pressure? .....
2,Best to pass this one by,"I listened to this book on audio tape while in the car - a new experience for me. Maybe it's because I prefer reading or maybe the narrator's voice became irritating, but this was not very entertaining. Sandra Brown is one of my favorite romantic-suspense authors and I have enjoyed many of her past works. Standoff is a light-weight story. Although the characters were together for many hours as hostages in a convenience store, I didn't feel like I knew them very well. The two teens who robbed the store and caused the problems definitely had some psychological issues, but I found myself not caring too much about them and waiting for the story to resolve. It does and ho-hum. Maybe it is more enjoyable in print, but judging from some of the other reviews, probably not. If you want to read a good Sandra Brown, try Witness or French Silk."
1,One star is generous for this book....,"The trite plot, poor writing, and tired cliches make this book one of the *worst* books I have ever read. Lines such as, ""At whom are you pissed?"" are laughable at best. Every character speaks in the same manner, bland and false. Ugh!"
1,Absolute Garbage,"I've read a couple of other Sandra Brown books (Alibi was particularly good), and was severaly disappointed by this. This book would not even be a decent effort by a novice attempting to break into the field, let alone an experienced professional. The plotline is absurd, requiring the reader to set aside *any* sense of reality. The character development is sub-par and one-dimensional. The people the central character dislikes (The FBI, the Father of the girl) are wooden and artificially evil and/or stupid. This is just one badly written book. Don't even waste your time. Maybe Sandra Brown will get back to being a decent writer, but if this is the best she can do, it's time to explore other career options."
3,Obviously not a literary work of art.........,But it's still entertaining. I enjoyed the story. Sandra Brown writes books that are easy to read in a hammock.....less dramatic and cheesy than some other authors of books of this kind. It was fun to read.
3,Short But Compelling,"This was a very delightful book. Even though it wasn't as good as her others novels such Exclusive,Witness, just to mention a few. But by no means a disappointment either. It was exciting and compelling and it had you at edge of your seat."
1,Doy!!,"This is one to leave by the toilet. Sandra Brown needs to look up the word ""prone,"" which in this book she repeatedly and annoyingly uses incorrectly. Pregnant women are never positioned prone. Duh!! Get a real editor."
2,A Dissapointing End,"I found this book by Sandra Brown to be very interesting until the end. What a dissapointment. The major story line of the whole book comes to a conclusion in a few short lines. After these few unfulfilling words, you jump from what seems to be a suspense story into a fluffy romance novel. Maybe the next one will be better!"
1,Worst book I have ever read,"I could comment on the racism, lack of creativity and lack of substance found in this novel. In conclusion, do not waste your mind and time reading this piece of fluff called a novel. Unless you are entertained by reckless, shallow, and unbelievable characters, I assume any person with a high school education at the least would find this book a real snoozer."
3,Short and Sweet,"Good if you're looking for a fast, engaging read. A touch of romance brings it all together. Not Brown's best effort, but still good for the beach!"
1,should have waited for paperback,"I was so anxious for a new Sandra Brown book. I was very disappointed, and feel I should not have wasted my money on the hardcover. Such a short book that never really got into any of the characters in any depth. What a waste of time to read this not very well written book."
4,A terrifc story - one of her best books yet.,"Standoff has an unusual premise and yet it's so well written so well woven that a great deal happens to make the characters come alive even though the story mostly spans over 6-7 hours. The writing is vivid, realistic, with a great deal of suspense and some underlying romantic attraction thrown in. I enjoy this story very much and highly recommend it. It's a great summer read-quick moving and hard to put down. Only her work ""Exclusive"" was better--"
1,Standoff is terrible,This cannot be the work of Sandra Brown! The writing is so elementary. I did not identify with characters. Story is NOT believable-stupid authority figures-a leading lady you don't even like. Please don't waste your time like i did.
1,Not worth the time or money,"I found this book very disappointing. I didn't feel any connection with the main character, Tiel and the ending was horrible. It was as if the author suddenly realized there was no sex in the book and threw it in just so there would be some. It also seemed like an afterthought to let the reader know what happened to Ronnie, Sabra, and Katherine. I'll think twice before buying another Sandra Brown book."
1,Skip This Book,"I love thrillers and mystery fiction and am a true afficianado of the form. While I'd heard of Sandra Brown, I'd never read her novels. Lucky me! If Standoff is any indication of her skill, I saved myself a lot of time.While fiction readers understand that plots often fall into place, Standoff is simply unbelievable. Ms. McCoy just happened to be in the convenience store when the teens came in to rob it, and the list is endless of silly, trite coincidences. Even moreso, the ending, filled with gratuitous poorly written sex, offended me. I'm in Italy right now on a business trip which is always my special time to read. Besides this book being a terrible disappointment I can't remember ever throwing a book away. Except Standoff, that is.Save your money."
2,Sandra Brown Could've Done Better,I think this book is like a child that drags itz feet. It was super long and boring. The characters were ok and the plot was ok but it was so LONG !!Tiel McCoy is this reporter and she stumbles upon this major story of two lovers. They're running away from one of their father because that father is a major tyrant. They get involved and the suspenseful journey begins.At least I hope its suspenseful for other readers because this was boring for me. I think Sandra Brown could've done better.
2,Short and quick!,"This book was a short, easy read. It was nothing extrordinary. However, if you are looking for a quick mildly entertaining read then this may be the book for you! I have never read any of Ms. Brown's other books, and after this one I don't think that I will be reading anymore. It just wasn't my style. I prefer books with more character development."
3,Not her best work,"The story was a bit slow moving for me. It was still good,but not as good as some of her other books like Witness and Unspeakable. Still,I will continue to read all her books."
2,What did I buy this for?,"The book over all was action packed but at the end all of a sudden like the standoff began it happened a romance springs up on the reader all to fast like turning the page and there it was. No, swooning or courting... just bang they did it... not a good romanace that we all know Ms. Brown to write. Next time I'll think about buying her next book very carefully."
1,This author writes bestsellers?,"This book felt like it was write-by-numbers, filled with far to many outrageous coincidences to be believable. (For example, Tiel's current love interest just so happens to reveal he's married in a phone call right before she gets drawn into the hostage situation, freeing her up for her next love interest who she spots immediately.) I had to wonder if all of Brown's books were like this how she ever managed to get anything published, she was clearly phoning it in for the paycheck here. The most annoying thing for me was the fact that the big bad villain (the girl's father) was never revealed to be anything more than a bullying jerk. I was expecting a damning revelation of physical/sexual abuse or something diabolical, but that never came. His final act, in light of the circumstances of the plot, and crimes other characters have already committed, doesn't seem all that bad. I gave Sandra Brown a chance, but she's not getting another one."
4,Very bad end,"The story of the book is excellent, although it has too many coincidences at the beginning of it, nevertheless, the abduction and all the problems with the hostages will keep you in the book and you will not be able to close it... until the abduction ends.The last 30 pages could be written in 5 pages or less and that end just took away a star, you can end the book when the abduction ends and read the las two pages and you will have an excellent book."
3,"Not bad, but not great, either","This is a Silhouette novel disguised as a bestseller. I read it in a day, literally. The entire story takes place in a gas station and is very fast-paced. It could easily be an episode of Law & Order.Tiel is a reporter headed for a vacation. While stopping for a snack, a story accidentially finds her. Of course, there's an Alpha Male involved, but the way the two get together is a bit contrived. I liked this story, despite the sappy happy ending. Just don't expect too much."
2,Harlequin romance pretends to be a thriller,"This book was an easy read, and that's about the best thing I can say about it. The plot was too predictable, and the sex scene was way too contrived. Sorry, I wanted a thriller, not a smut novel. The cover looked good, however (don't judge a book ...)."
2,not the usual sandra brown suspense,"I have read every book by Sandra Brown. I like her later works with romance/suspense. However, this book was a disappointment. The whole book consists of one night. I found the characters very predictable and boring. The only positive factor is that it was short so I didn't waste much time."
4,GOOD.. BUT NOT GREAT,"Although not up to the regular Sandra Brown standard of romantic/suspense, it was a good read. Short and didn't dwell anywhere too long. I would wait for the paperback or check it out at the library. You will want to read it just because it is Sandra Brown. Try Mirror Image or Slow Heat In Heaven by Sandra Brown for a taste of the real thing."
1,Quite possibly the worst book I have ever read.,"The story is quite ridiculous, characters wooden, and please do not get me started on the dialog. I could not contain my laughter when one of the characters actually said, ""At whom are you pissed?"" Grammatically correct, but has anyone ever uttered this sentence in real life? The 'love scene' is equally pitiable and completely out of place from the rest of the book - I read it out loud to a group of friends; we came to tears from laughing so hard.Do yourself a favor and skip this one."
2,Not Brown's Best,"I too had been waiting for Ms. Brown's latest book. This one left me flat. I read the short story in just a few hours & felt the ""teenage"" trama could have been more fully developed.And to be honest, I missed the mix of passionate romantic scenes & suspense of her other books such as ""Fat Tuesday"" or ""Exclusive"". They always made my heart flutter and as Ms. Brown might say, ""...my lower regions moisten."""
3,"Not bad, not good","I am new to reading Sandra Brown's work, but did not find it to be quite the disappointment other readers did. I felt the characters to be fairly well fleshed out. The heroine of the story was likeable, but not too much so. The plot was well thought out and the action was never lagging. My main problem was with the ending, it seemed rather contrived. The loose ends were were tied up a little too quickly and left me with a flat feeling at the end. The book warrents me taking a second look at previous books by the author. I think it is an enjoyable read, but it just needed an ending that was more thought out."
2,Not Up To Par,"This book was too short. I found myself wanting to see what happend after the standoff in the lives of the the main characters. However, if you are looking for a quick read that isn't too involving, this could be an ok book for you."
4,Fast and Easy Read,"Standoff was very well written. It moved quickly and easy. This is a great summer read! I finished the book in one night. It was shorter than most of Brown's current books; but, still very good. There were also some interesting twists in the story with some very unique characters."
3,"The good, the bad, and the boring","This book is so difficult for me to review. I liked some things very much while others left me cold. Circe is definitely an unusual heroine; her outspokenness and greater-than-her-age wisdom are refreshing. David is sometimes annoying as a man is doesn't know who he wants to be, though he has certainly gorwn up since his brief appearance in Dear Imposter. His mother is an awful woman. It's wonderful to see Psyche and Gabriel again (from Dear Imposter); they play significant roles. And that novel's secondary character Sally makes her presence here as a secondary heroine, her romance almost as important as Circe's. Her beau is delightful, and their romance sweet. The epilogue is perfection.Unfortunately, the action/mystery lacks conviction and often detracts from the rest of the book. As a result, the book is uneven and does not hold the reader's attention as well as its predecessor."
3,so-so,"Just for the record, the brush sweep should be notated thus: Draw a horizontal line replacing the note head in the E (what would be E if this were bass clef, that is) snare space with a slur to show that brush is not lifted. Two brushes on the snare require alternate stem direction."
4,grew on me big time,"Perhaps I had enough electronica in the 80's, but the allure of a guitar and good vocals is usually what I will turn toward now. My first reaction to this C.D. was the same as with my introducion to the Postal Service...ugh, stop with the keyboard already...but in both cases the cleaver lyrics and inteligent compositions of the tunes conviced me to stick around awhile. Let me just say if this C.D. were a cassette tape...the first 4 tracks wouldn't play anymore they would be so worn out."
5,UPDATED: NO LONGER COPY PROTECTED,"As other people have noticed, this item is no longer copy protected. I still strongly recommend it."
4,Refuse to buy copy-protected CDs! Period.,"It's a shame that the recording industry is so insecure and out of touch with the current music buying public that they have resorted to deceit and disinformation with the use of ""copy protection"" software that installs itself, contains outrageous and absurd conditions (may not use music if you file bankruptcy!), and most importantly, makes the average home user vulvernable to all kinds of viruses, malware, and spyware that can potentially seriously damage or destroy the user's computer. Sony is the most egregious offender and its music products should be boycotted---regardless of whatever apologies or ""fixes"" they claim to offer. If you're comfortable risking the performance and functionality of your $3000 computer by ""doing the right thing"" by purchasing overpriced copy protected CDs, then go for it. Otherwise, stick to iTunes (or even file sharing programs), and labels that do not use these devious and harmful tactics."
1,"Music, GREAT. Copy protection, VERY BAD","It doesn't matter how brilliant the artist is (like Imogen Heap. Love her!). I will NEVER buy a copy-protected CD. Let's keep sounding off, everyone. Sony is killing themselves with this computer-crashing scheme."
5,Great album,"I just bought this album a few days ago and klike her first solo cd before the days of frou frou which I never got there album. this album is very addicting. I have been playing songs like Loose Ends, Headlock, I'm in love with you and Hide and seek over and over. it does not look like I will get tired of this album anytime soon. Imogen is one of the best solo female artists that have come along in quite some time. her music is very soulful and very cool."
3,Different but good,"I bought this for my sister, and her tastes are somewhat different from mine, but we both have eclectic tastes. This album is different, inventive, pretty, silly, catchy, and from another planet. But a whole lot of fun. Some songs are a bit under-written, and some are a bit dull, but I think anyone who is browsing this cd should buy it."
5,"Fantastic! Better than Frou Frou's ""Details"".","Imogen Heap, fresh from the success of her Frou Frou collaboration, ""Details"", brings us ""Speak for Yourself"", a solo album showcasing the chanteuse's most elaborate vocal talents. Fresh, vibrant, and inexplicably harmonious, nearly each song in the album pulsates with aural beauty.Personal favorites (although I appreciate all of them):Goodnight and GoHave You Got it In You?Hide and SeekClear the AreaDaylight RobberyThe Moment I Said It (the final, and arguably best track)I cannot wait for another record from this artist. In short, ""Speak for Yourself"" ranks as one of the best albums of the year, not to mention one of the best vocal performances in years. Highly recommended!"
2,Quite a surprise,"Of a million reviews, I'm sure this one won't stand out.Just like in a million albums, this one didn't stand out.I dug the Frou Frou stuff, and went from there to here. It just kind of fell flat for me -- lost the slick production that gave her music an edge enough to listen through easily.It's not TERRIBLE. But it's not for everyone. I am one of the people for whom this album is not."
1,What a bore --,"If you are into the singer songwriter, trip-hop, electronica, folk, alt, genre and are looking for something new, different and fresh .. well, this is not it. Teeny bopper poop, that's what this is. No offense to the younger listening audience (I've got to assume that's where all the 4 star ratings come from), but I guarantee that you will eventually be bored as much as I am with this stuff, and if you like it now, in a few years it will be in your ""I can't believe I used to listen to this pile"". One would hope that this kind of formative music will eventually lead to greater pursuits. I would encourage all of you to open your minds and dig a bit deeper. There is sooo much out there that is sooo much better than this."
1,Sucker!,"I bought this album sight unseen on the strength of ""Hide and Seek"" and well.....this one goes to the used record store tomorrow....in a plain brown wrapper to save me the embarassment. What I thought was going to be spare, sonic and personal turned out to be just another teeny pop queen album complete with drum machine and sophomoric Sarah McLachlan wannabe lyrics. I could almost imagine her dancing on stage with her Brittany mike and the Backstreet Boys. Maybe it's a genre thing, or maybe it's because I got the Books' Lemon of Pink"" the same day, but this seemed saccharine and trite like no other album I've ever owned. Now where's that brown paper....?"
4,Original new talent,"With the exception of 2 mediocre songs, this has some outstanding tracks and great production. A combo of Sinead/Sarah McLachlan/Kate Bush/Cocteau Twins/PJ Harvey -- all the best elements of each. Great voice, and amazing talent. Check out live performances on youtube -- you'll be sold."
5,Amazing Voice and Songs,"I heard HIDE AND SEEK while watching the premiere of SMITH on CBS. The song blew me away and I immediately started searching the Internet for the artist. Heap's album, SPEAK FOR YOURSELF, is fresh and addictive. HEADLOCK will embed itself in your gray matter and sing to you all day. Drop everything and buy this album. You won't regret it."
4,"Imogen Heap-""Speak for Yourself""","Imogen's voice is hauntingly beautiful, and i enjoyed the entire cd very much.If you like Dido with a bit more of a pop beat you will enjoy this one."
4,imogen heap,"""hide and seek"" is an AMAZING song. the rest of the tracks dont compair, unfortunately, but are still really good. its very original and heart warming. deffinately worth having in my cd collection."
1,Music,I actually never revived this CD and don't even know I had bought it. Not sure if I bought this or if someone else did.
5,One of the best ever!,"In ""Speak For Yourself"", Imogen Heap has created an album of consistently tight, innovative, and well-executed tracks. She is a combination of amazing musician, amazing writer, and amazing singer - and all of those skills are clearly evident in this album. This is an album you can listen to over and over again and I highly recommend it!"
4,Impressive introduction to her music...,"This is one of the most surprising albums I have bought recently. Never really a fan of electro-synth pop until I heard Goldfrapp, Imogen Heap's ""Speak for Yourself"" has been in my CD player for the last 2 weeks that I have owned it. The songs need a few listens to grow on you, but with catchy beats and a strong electronica presence on every track, this album is a mix of genres including pop, electro, dance and alternative. The sound brings to mind Jewel's 0304 album mashed up with Fischerspooner. Heap has a calming voice, great vocals, and provides stand out tracks with ""Headlock"", ""Goodnight and Go"" and ""Loose Ends"" (awesome track!). The whole vocoder thing goes a little overboard in ""Hide and Seek"" but for the rest of its length, the album grooves through slow-paced and fast tracks, providing a collection of haunting and hook-laden pop music that's perfect for that long drive."
4,great cd,"I really enjoy this cd, it's worth buying if for no other reason than the famous ""hide and seek"" (SNL ""dear sister"" digital short.) she's as catchy as pop without being annoying."
5,Unbelievable!!!,"Speaking for myself, Hide And Seek is the best song I have heard in the last 20 years. Amazing sound, recording, and a joy to listen to over and over and over. The rest of the record is very good as well. I heard this CD because a guy I work with received it for Christmas. We listened to it at work. Neither of us knew who Imogen Heap was. If I could ever meet the guy that got it for my friend I would not be able to thank him enough."
4,Excellent and Chill,Bought this CD after having heard a few songs from it and loving them. The CD did not disappoint. The lyrics are poignant and clever and the music is chill but interesting. I love to play this CD at work or when I'm driving.
4,Puhlease......,"Why would I buy a cd that could potentially harm my computer if I play it in my cd-rom? I don't want some company's spyware/malware [...] on my computer, let alone it being installed without me knowing! I was prepared to LEGALLY buy the music and now it's just not good enough for the industry anymore. I'm not a criminal, I shouldn't be treated like one.Copy protect the disk all you want, but don't mess with MY personal property, because you can't control YOUR OWN.I love this music and it's a great album, but I won't be buying into this [...]."
5,Celestial,"My only review is this CD from Imogen Heap. I'm not one to write reviews or listen to much electriconica music but this one is notably exceptional. I don't know how I came across this, I heard she sang for Frou Frou and I enjoyed her voice so much I tried a download from her. Hide and Seek is one song that will ruffle your feathers, getting under the skin, boiling emotions to the surface. I thought I was going to explode. Goosebumps, tears, whatever was within came right out. I will share this music with everyone I know. I've never heard of O.C. because I don't watch TV, so this came as a complete surprise. I'm telling you it overtook me. I fell apart right then and there. If you are looking for a powerful new musician, in a period when inspiration seems null / void, try this CD. If you are in love or love lost, this music will embrace you, hug you and you will feel love. From the heavens above. God has obviously blessed Imogen Heap."
5,Best!,"This is beyond one of the best CDs I have bought in a while. I love every song, and I'm pretty sure you might too. :)"
3,Mostly what I expected.,"""Speak for Yourself"" is a solidly produced, enjoyable album. I was impressed and pleased enough with a few songs on the album, such as ""The Walk"" (which is the song that drove me to buy the album), to feel that I made a good purchase. It's a real pleasure to listen to the vocalist sing. Existing fans of Imogen Heap may appreciate and enjoy ""Speak for Yourself"" more than I did; I see lots of glowing remarks from other reviewers here. Personally I found some of the songs to be lyrically lacking, and some of the tracks are somewhat forgettable and uninteresting. Production is very high-quality and I never noticed anything poorly recorded or implemented. If you're already a fan of Imogen Heap or Frou Frou, I would certainly recommend you purchase this as well."
4,"Eclectic, creative, great voice and music!","I had heard a couple of songs and purchased this album and I found her voice was very cool and her songs and music different and fun. I must admit I don't like every song on here, but they all have something to offer. It's hard to compare her to others...I'd say she kind of reminds me of Jem and of course Frou Frou. If you like her song samples then you'll most likely like her album and I recommend it. :)"
4,Fun album with repeatablity,"Imogen Heap has a beautiful voice. This album is filled with songs that highlight that voice without seeming to overwhelm you with it. The album is enjoyable listening to as a whole or focusing on a couple of songs. It stands up to repeated listening, which is more than can be said for much of the popular radio fare."
1,Great music. Nasty copy protection. DO NOT BUY IT!,Another great album by an artist who wants to trample on consumer rights and live in the 1980's. The copy protection on this album will destroy your systems. Do not buy it.
4,Soul Pop is what it is!,"I first saw this band open for Liquid Soul (check them out as well, btw) in San Fransisco, and was instantly drawn in by their stage presence and pure talent. They've managed to match this energy and skill on ""Soul Pop"", an album that harkens back to the classic Motown funk and soul sounds without being too derivative. By mixing these styles with more modern ones, they've created an uplifting and genuine album. Can't wait for the next one!"
2,time not correct&#65292; around 15 secs lag every'day,"time not correct&#65292; around 15 secs lag every'dayNot sure what is the problem, may be battery is almost dead."
5,A watch for 28 years,"This is a great watch, I had the past model for 28 years and used it everyday. Swimming, scuba diving, nmountainbike riding, 28 years on my arm. A month ago it finally gave up and I asked for the exact model equivalent to the one I had, I was refered to this one, so I bought it and I'm expecting to use it for other 28 years."
5,A Really Great Watch,I've had this watch for nearly 4 years now and it has been very reliable and has remained water resistant for all this time. I highly recomend this watch but I also recomend that you select your watch in person.
4,Nice watch..band is questionable..,"I received this watch as a gift from a friend who ordered it from Amazon. I looked at the watch in the store(national Jewelry) before ordering. One thing I noticed is the band from Amazon is different than the store bought one. The store bought one weighs a little more and moves more easily and is more flexible and has more depth and dimension to it. Thus, it makes it feel more substantial. For a 3rd comparison, I went to Macy's and the band from Macy's is the same one as from Amazon. So, either the Jewelry store one is different, or the band style has changed form the manufacturer. Not sure which one. I wish the one from Amazon had the band I prefer, but other than that, the watch is beautiful and very nice and the price is right."
1,Frustrated!,After 2 solid attempts to apply this caulk to my shower this morning it is all mush again! I have to again spent an hour removing it all and making a big mess. I'll definitely be buying a different product today before I redo it. I rarely review products but this stuff is CRAP! Although it may work for areas that don't get wet it is NOT good for a shower or bath.
5,"Sex, Murder, and Romance","Tatiana and Mathew in this book is just wonderful. She's a upscale black woman, and he is a white male climbing the corporate ladder. He has issues from his past and thinks no one loves him. Tatiana is attracted to Mathew from their second or third meeting not the first or she tells herself. They becomes friends and than fall in love but instead of the man running after the woman its the woman running after the man. What a great read buy this one it is a keeper. What with romance, sex and murder you will be glued to your books."
4,greatly pleased,"This book tickled my imagination. There were a few typos but the story itself had me from go. These two need each other like the moon needs the sun. It was magic for me, I have reread it twice since I bought it. I like to see a story like this told from the heart. Even if it is fiction and it was her first book, I'll buy everything she outs out because she can only get better."
3,I tried...I really tried!,"...To like this story. At the conclusion, I could only reflect on the multitude of ""near-misses""!!! Just when it appeared to approach an area of depth and meaning, the author backed away.The characters were too back/forth then off/on for me. And Tatiana's last, selfish scheme of disappearance did me in. Oh my goodness -- the typos were noticeably distracting. I could have done a better job of editing.Overall, it wasn't 'horrible'. It just didn't meet my expecations. If you're rained in or maybe stranded in the airport, it will provide a nice attention diversion.Oh well, back to my reliable favorites: Judith Smith-Levin and Sandra Kitt."
1,Save your money and your time,"I read this book. I was determined that my hard earned money would not go to waste, but it was a trial.From the onset, I realized that this was not a greatly developed story. Neither character was very endearing. There relationship was so on again off again, and the characters of Mathew and Tatiana, so wishy washy it left me wanting something, anything!I love reading interracial romance books, but this particular book leaves a lot to be desired. The story is chocked-filled with more holes than a slice of swiss cheese. And there were so many typos, I could have done a better job of editing.I tried to see through to the good part, but it just wasn't there. However, it kept going and going just like that bunny commercial, and it wouldn't stop. Leave this one on the shelf."
2,Lacks originality,"This book wasn't cheap so I felt compelled to finish it, though it took some considerable effort. This is an interracial romance, which should be more than enough drama for the main characters. Yet, the author saddles Tatiana and Mathew with the typical romance story conventions. She is the naive virgin and he is the guy with the mysterious and tortured past. But Mathew's past is more tortured and complicated than most. He spends a lot of time brooding about how undesirable he is. Too much time. I started to believe it about halfway through. His extreme degree of self-consciousness was really not attractive. Tatiana did not seem to be a fully developed character. She seemed incredibly young for her age and I never thought the two were all that compatible. Neither one of them had strong, likeable personalities. Too much of a pity party. Extremely disappointing."
1,Hearts of Fire,Awful. Just plain awful. Don't waste your money or time. I can just imagine how excrutiating the author's next book will be to read.
3,Comfortable but tiny,"I have been wanting to try these for a long time but didn't because of the price. I decided to suck it up and try them after all. I like that they are biodegradable, even the protective ""plastic"" layer is made of corn. I got the regular ones since the store didn't have the longer ones and they are very comfortable and thin. The problem though is that they are not very absorbent. For heavy flow you would have to change very often, which means that you would use more pads and at this price it would end up being very expensive. I am thinking of using them only on the last couple of days of my period, because using them on the first day was a bit of a disaster (I don't need to be stressed about leaks, especially when I am at work, thank you)."
1,Warning: Live music,"I bought this CD hoping for the original tracks, but didn't realize that it only had live music. Buyers beware..."
3,It was good,Again i just love the movie for John Ritter. But the movie was good anyway. Considering the ending.
2,"OKAY, BUT NOT UP TO HER POTENTIAL","Rita Macneil is not a great singer in my opionion, but she has proven herself to be a gifted songwriter over the years. This collection has some interesting material like the gospel-flavoured ""Said I wasn't gonna tell nobody"" and an okay version of Peace In The Valley, but is spoiled by an over-dramatic and occasionally out-of-tune Higher Power. Overall, the album's celtic flavour is a benefit, but as a ""spiritual album"" it doesn't compare with my other spiritual CDs."
5,"The Gospel According to Jazz, chapter 1,2, & 3",I bought these CD's for myself and then had to purchase them for a friend...they are simply awesome. The musical expression of the Lord God is fantastic!! I love the way you can have a jazz feel with gospel music it is a must buy for any and all who enjoy both gospel and smooth jazz...
3,Another delightful entre' by Mr Whalum,"Yes with ""III"",Kirk, again has shown that the Holy Spirit is uncontainable and very fluid. Smooth jazz & r&b favorites are woven into heavenly blessings as we reflect on familiar music and our past and we know it was only by the grace of God we've come this far. Hallalujah and thank you Mr. Whalums: Kirk, Kevin, Kyle, Kenneth & Peanut."
5,Great Music!,"You will enjoy Kirk Whalum, friends and family....along with some insightful thoughts from Kirk.This is a must have for any music lovers collection."
1,"this ""new"" item IS NOT NEW,","while the disk seems unmarred, it is obvious that it is NOT new. it is nit wrapped in cellophane, and has one security strip. the side of the case that has no security strip is broken- I can only guess it was opened, used and replaced. if I wanted a used disk, I'd have paid a USED price! I feel deceived."
3,Great flute - not so great musical selections,There is no doubt that James Galway is a master of the flute. I only bought it for one beautiful song on the CD (il pastore svizzero). The musical selections on this CD will alternately put his friends to sleep and then wake them up with disharmonous musical pieces. Not the most enjoyable selections.
3,Nice collection of tracks.,"I find Ink to be a pretty good album from The Fixx. I still like to listen to this disc from time to time. There's a total of twelve tracks, and all of them are listenable and atmospheric. The musical direction of the album is pop rock with a progressive touch. The musicianship is proficient, and the songwriting is good. Cy Curnin does a nice job with the vocals--he has a unique voice. My favorite track is ""How Much Is Enough."" The lyrics to ""How Much Is Enough"" are really interesting, too. The CD booklet contains the lyrics to the songs. Ink is worth a listen."
4,Ink is a must-have if you dig the Fixx,"A nice clash against the music being made at the time (1991), Ink was a breath of fresh air in the early 90s. The tunes still hold up today, especailly Yesterday/Today and All the Best Things Are Free. Great vocals from Cy Curnin and stirring guitars from Jamie West-Oram that helped give the Fixx their distinctive sound."
3,Solid but not Perfect.,"Though many Fixx fans may slag the album for it's attempt at commercial success, due greatly in part to the Record Company's heavy involvement at the time, overall, this record is as solid as any Fixx album before it. It easily boasts some of their finest songs ever in How Much Is Enough, No One Has To Cry and Crucified. While also giving us classic Fixx tracks like Shut It Out and All Is Fair.It doesn't earn more stars purely because some tracks come off as fillers. However, even those songs have some merit, providing the disc with a pleasant overall sound.Lyrically, it's a brilliant disc, as Fixx fans have come to expect. Musically, it's a little misguided in places but the execution is solid.The Cd bonus track Make No Plans is almost worth the purchase itself."
3,"Not their best, but at just over $5 a pretty good buy","This was their last album, till this year's Elemental (which is fantastic, by the way).Ink is a departure from the familiar Fixx sound, and the first few tracks don't really grab you.However, as the album goes on, the material actually gets much stronger, culminating with the marvelous ""Yesterday, Today"", and my favorite: ""One Jungle"".Includes the semi-hit ""How Much is Enough"""
4,does the job well!,"I love almost everything about this container. It's durable, holds the perfect amount to save for another dinner, and can go in the freezer, oven, and dishwasher! The only thing I wish is that it had some sort of tab on the lid to help take it off - it's quite tight, which is excellent for freezing purposes, but can be hard to take off."
2,No handles make it hard to take out of the oven,"I bought this dish thinking it woud be space effiecent in the freezer, which it is. But since it doesn't have handles its very hard to remove from the oven while wearing oven mitts. I have come close to dropping a hot dish several times. I wish I had bought something different with handles."
3,Not for highschoolers,"The description of the book is deceptive. Although written by two high school teachers it is for grades 4-8, which you cannot make out on the picture. Not until it arrived did I see that grade range. This book came up under a search for ""high school creative writing text"" so be aware it is not for highschoolers."
2,Ribald tale too coarse for my taste..,"""Cabin Road"" is a certain type of bawdy tale that is no doubt widely produced and with a long tradition. And to his credit, John Faulker did a good job in the telling - the characterizations are appropriately written a bit over the top, the situations are farcical to the point of near impossibility, and the characters are oddly loveable goofs in spite of some very ugly traits and flaws. Having said all of that, I couldn't get past the coarseness of the content to get at the decent bit of writing on display. From that perspective, then, I'd have to give it only two stars. If interested in John Faulkner, try ""Dollar Cotton"" instead - a harsh book with a lot of distasteful elements, but set out in a serious way that makes the ugly a point of contemplation rather than of pitiable smirks."
1,Crime Mob suck a fat one!,"yes, just what we need further perpetuation of the African American stereotype. Spend less time complaining and more time realizing that you're doing it to yourselves! 1 star? I think this album should give me 1 star!1 of 17 people found my review helpful. It's easy to review something you love. Most of the time reviews are positive because people are more likely to review something they love. I give credit to those who review things they find less than favorable. I cannot write a critical revew of this album, because this is not an album. This is not music."
4,Hate on,"This cd is by far the hardest hitting album of the year. Crime mob has talented producers and a great crew led by two female rappers that go off on this cd, its crazy. The beats are fantastic and there are about 5 to 6 songs on this track that will blow your mind away. Such as 2nd look, rock yo hips, shine cuz I grind, circles, we some playaz and wuz-up. All of these songs will make you throw your hands up and get crunk wit it in your car or wherever you are. If you like hard lyrics and throwed beats then you deffinetly need to get this album."
5,Bridge Street Main,"I was fortunate enough to be introduced to this album through a small live performance given by Charlie in Phoenixville,PA (the area which the album is based on). The music was amazing. Immediately after the show I bought the CD and listened to it often. It is easily one of the best albums I have heard in a long time. Every song is genuine & full of deep emotion. He is an amazing artist who pours himself into every song on this album. I STRONGLY recommend this album to anyone who enjoys quality music by an artist who is true to himself. Go get it now!!"
5,Great Game. Something for Everyone.,We played this at Christmas with family and then had to go out and buy our own set. It is a perfect blend of game themes/styles. We have played it with people as young as 8 years old and they had fun as well. It is played with teams so everyone gets to feel included. :) A great buy.
3,It's better than the movie,It's better than the movie that in fact the soundtrack doesn't bore you as does the movie itself.
2,Don't trust Singer,I agree...don't trust Singer. My machine never sews a good stitch and the bobin continuously falls out it's case causing huge loops in my stitching. I contacted them and got a standard e-mail- they didn't address the issue at all and didn't offer a suggestion or solution. $199 down the tubes!
2,it's good until you need it fixed,"i really liked this machine until my needle clamp went awol during a move. since this is a mass-marketed low-end machine, singer does not market replacement parts for it, and nobody's willing to help. my local sewing store has a lot of machines lying around for parts; that's my only hope at this point. caveat emptor."
5,"Brilliant performance, excellent recording","Rubinstein and Reiner produce an excellent recording of Rachmaninov's Rhapsody. The piano is clear, the orchestra is strong but not overwhelming, and the disc sounds great in all respects."
4,Dora's wizard wizzle of OZ,"The only real criticism I could see, except mabey that my three year old will no longer watch anything else was the cheap parody of Wizard of OZ that never really feels completed. Plus ""wizzles"", you would think that after 10 years of cartoons you could come up with something more complete. But this is a kids movie."
2,"No Background, Only Abridged Legends","I received this book as a gift for my birthday recently. The book has 222 stories which the author defines as ""urban legends."" The book has abbreviated versions of the legends, cutting out several details that made the originals so believable in the first place. The book has no explanation of how the legend got started, what facts may have been involved, or how the legend was proven false. The book is also a frustrating read as the editor was asleep during the book's publication. Many stories seem to have serious spelling mistakes. It seems as if the book was edited only with a computer's ""spell check"" command."
4,Great Gift,"This book has made my official ""fun gift books"" list this year. If you are my friend, be expecting this book or one of these for your birthday or anniversary this year.The RoMANtic's Guide, The Darwin Awards, Ultimate Survival Guide"
3,"Not bad, good diversion but not great literature","1. ""No really, it's true, it happened to a freind, but I don't have the article...."" Did the author write that last review as a joke????2. The bad writing is how the stories were written by the morons that started these emails."
3,"Fun Stories with Bad, Bad Editing","Originally, I bought it for a friend, but it sounded interesting so I kept it for myself... Upon reading it, I found that the book was very amusing with a good mix of stories (things that I know to be true as well as things that I find to be mildly questionable). However, there is one major problem with this book: The editing is TERRIBLE! Some sentences in the book do not make sense (whether in or out of context). The errors are so numerous that it seriously detracts from the stories. A third grader could proofread better."
2,Five Star misses an opportunity on a major label,"The self titled 1990 album by Five Star is very uneven and suffers from poor production quality, and consistancy. There are some excellent tracks, What About Me Baby is one of their best songs of all time...so why was it not the 1st release off the album....better yet never release at all? Some other good tracks are Lost In You with Delroy sounding great on lead vocals, and Feel Much Better, with Denise on lead vocals where she should be souding great. The rest of the album is just not up too par, however the track I Can Show You Love with Lorraine sounding great on lead vocals could have been so much better with some decent production values. It is a shame that when Five Star had a major recording contract with Epic they released this poorly produced album that flopped."
2,Nothing Special,This is was just okay for me. It was nothing special. With all due respect to the esteemed reviewer above me it is one of Bernstein's lesser scores. I cannot recommend it and I have no favorite tracks.
1,Unfulfilled,"I didn't like this book hence the 1 star and title. The heroine, Adora was strong and smart as most of Small's female characters are, but I hated Helena (heroine's sis). She never paid for all the numerous things she did to her sister. Spoiler Alert: She killed the heroines second husband. This infuriated me, b/c I liked Alexander a lot more than the hero, Murad. I hated reading Murad have sex with other women. I don't care how many times the author said Adora was his favorite, it was frustrating and not at all a romance. The book was more historical/ military strategy etc. Not a romance. I also hated the description of children being raped. Again not a romance."
3,Loved it but . . .,"I did love this book, except I was truly appalled by the detailed parts of little children being brutally raped. HORRIBLE! AND NOT NEEDED even though this type of thing happend in this culture, a mild reference could have been made, but not in such detail. In my opinion, Ms. Small, rape of children does not need to be brought out to make a story believable or interesting. Anyone who is interested in children being raped other than to put a stop to it, is sick. Maybe this is why I stopped reading your books a few years ago, but took a chance on this one."
5,WOW,"words can not describe how incedably well writen this story is. The author goes threw adora's life and places her in realistic stiuations that women faced every day back then. you will fall in love with adora and cry when she does, love when she does, and hate when she does. You can't help but cry in the end."
2,Too much!,"Simply too much rape, pillage and betrayal. The story was over the top. Small's The Love Slave which is set in a similar time period is a much more endearing love story."
2,Typical,"Nothing romantic here...Stolen or sold ""heroine"" - raped by all husbands...yet loves them all?Very predictable formula writing here. Couldn't wait to finish it and not because I cared how it ended!Totally unsatisfying for a Small novel."
4,Coming back to romance,"I used to read Beatrice when I was In high school,and then I stopped one evening when I just needed to travel to another time I saw her and said why not. I am glad I did. She is an excellent story teller but injects real people of history which makes the story all the more engaging. I recommend any of her books."
3,Adora by Bertrice Small,I love reading the books Bertrice Small writes but this book wasn't as great as her other books. If you are a fan of her you will enjoy it.
1,Worst romantic history I've ever read...,"I have never read a book by Bertrice Small and after this one, I'm not sure I ever will. This was not romance! Not only was the history BORING, but I didn't appreciate the bits of perversion (sex with a 10 yr old girl!!). Maybe that was how life really was for this time period and this location, but I don't want to read about it in a ""romance"" book. It did evoke many emotions from me, but most of what I felt was ""Ugh, will this ever be over??"" I would NOT recommend this book. As a matter of fact, I went to return the title for a refund but unfortunately I could not. I'm stuck with it. :( In short, if you are looking for a romantic history, this is not the book for you."
2,Strange,This was not one of my favorite books by Bert rice small...it was too violent and graphic to the point of disgusting...especially when children were raped and beaten. Would not recommend this to the faint of heart....
2,Disappointing,Good beginning poor last third.You will want to be buying a new book half way through.A disappointment after Love Wild &Fair.
1,absolute trash,"I don't understand how anyone could possibly find anything romantic in the heroine being raped, not once, but TWICE by her ""beloved."""
1,Is there such a thing as 0 stars?,"Trash, total trash.Poorly written trash.Inconsistencies, choppy dialog and shallow characters.Main character finds it enchanting that men who want her, sometimes have to rape her to get what they want, never the less she falls in love with them, finds pleasure when they rape her and even loves them sometimes. The author overindulged in the ""rape"" fantasy here. This book is total waste of money. Read ""The Love Slave"", much better history, superb writing and real interesting read, although again forceful sex is omnipresent."
1,"bodice ripper, rapist hero","I read this one back when it was first published and it read exactly like a 1980's bodice ripper. The heroine has multiple husbands. The hero has multiple wives, but unlike her he has them simultaneously. Yup he has a harem and this is one of Ms. Small's many harem ""romances"". Where's the romance in sharing your husband with other women?I really disliked this book. The heroine's first husband has a eunuch rape her with a wooden ""thing"" because he can't be bothered to take her virginity himself. Her second husband rapes her after putting her in some drugged state. Her third husband (her first one's son) rapes her before the old man is cold. And he's the hero!Save your money."
5,Sweeping Passion!,"Adora and Murad are wonderful characters. When we first meet Theadora she is a child, so we really feel like we know her by the books end. Murad is a very complex man. On one hand he loves and wants Adora, yet he also is unable to forgive her for marrying his father. The struggles these two go through are seemingly insurmountable,yet they somehow manage to conquer everything. At times Murad is worthy of your dislike, yet in the end all that he has done makes no difference. The Turkish history in this book is fascinating. and the story excellent.A great book!"
3,Okay but could be better,I bought this book awhile ago but just could not bring myself to read it. I love Bertrice Small's books set in England and Scotland and this book just did not sound interesting enough. I have finally read it and I must say it ranked right where I thought it would. This is the first book I have read from her that did not leave me wanting more. I was happy when it was finished.It started off really good if a bit difficult to follow at times. However about half way through the story really began to drag and lose my interest. There is to much happening in this time period and Mrs Small tried to cover to many different areas of 1300 AD Asia that it became more of a history lesson than a romantic story. It would have made a great series like a few of her others but just as a single book in this time period I have read far better from other authors.
5,The best book by Bertrice Small at such a low cost!,"This is my favorite book by Bertrice Small. I have it in paperback and it's falling apart from how many times I've read it. Love it, love it, love it now on my kindle for only $1.19!!!!"
4,Thrilling and Interesting,"When I finally was able to find 'Adora' in my local bookstore, I was thrilled. I devoured it within a week. As always, Ms. Small's knowledge of history intertwined with the magnificent love stories that are her trademark, made for a satisfying read. Adora is one of my favorite heroines (after Skye O'Malley) and the wonder and splendor of Constantinople has always captured my imagination. Adora's life was so lavish and rich, and Ms. Small paints a picture with her detailed prose. I rated this book four stars because of the length -- a bit longer than some others, but still all in all a great novel. Recommended for anyone who loves Bertrice Small and historical romance."
3,Actually about a 3 1/2 stars-not 1 of Small's best,"I agree with some of the other reviewers about this book. I have read most of Bertrice Small's books and I was hoping that this one was another Skye or Kadin. It was Not! It started out good, got a little brutal and disgusting with some of the characters. I did like Adora and Murad was O.K. At least there was enduring love between the 2 of them. Her books and harem life can have some very yucky parts to them. I would like to have had her sister reach a bad end but seems that never happened, unless I missed something. The last quarter of the book got a little boring, redundent and slow. I am glad I read the book and the very very ending was good. I would recommend the book if you like Bertrice Small, but in my opinion it was far from her best."
5,:),"One of her best. Adora is a classic Bertrice Small. You fall in love with the character. For a ""smut"" book, it is ""classy""."
2,ehhh,"Love the romance part about the book, but the part of the perversions consist of child rape. The part that I would have loved more time on was killed off real quick."
2,an ok book,this wasn't one of Bertrice Small's best book. I am ok with the idea of a harem. but I can't get used to the fact that Adora was the wife of the sultan and yet she is in love with the son.
4,interesting period in history,A very interesting period in history. The love story was so-so but I liked the family intrigue and the setting.
5,Adora,"Captivates you from the begining; great love story, beautifully written.I am hooked on this era and would enjoy reading more from this time period."
2,Not a romance novel...,"I'm not sure why this book is categorized as romance because it's really closer to historical fiction. Categories aside, I really did not enjoy this book. The hero is extremely unlikable, the heroine is not believable, and I found myself rolling my eyes quite a bit. It moves along at a good pace, but it's basically an unpleasant gauntlet of every bad thing that can possibly happen to a person does, and sometimes more than once."
5,reaching dreams,"this song is tight...whenever i hear this song,it always presues me to urge toward my career adn keeps me going.i love this song,it is a great inspiration for anyone whom is persuing a dream or in love."
1,Arly is much better,"After having read a number of Hess' ""Arly Hanks"" books, I decided to give Claire Malloy a try. I was disappointed with the characters and, in particular, this story line. Both were much too predictable. I had to keep checking the cover to make sure it was the same author as the one I've always found enjoyable in the Arly Hanks series."
2,Soundtrack somewhat more buoyant than stage production,"After waiting a long time to see the musical, I must say I was extremely disappointed. Despite mediocre acting and tacky looking sets, the musical score itself only had one or two songs that could do anything to help the story stay afloat. I have seen countless musical and stage productions, and I must say that this is one of the worst I have ever seen. It seems that many reviewers have not experienced good theater, due to their high markings for this soundtrack. I don't know if Titanic is worth getting for the one or two ""good songs"". The music does not do justice to a storyline that is so popular and important in this day and age. Definitely look in the used section of the music store for this recording as I believe many people will be ditching this one soon. There is a reason this musical is closing after only two years. It stinks!"
1,Very Disappointed,Not worth buying. I borrowed it from someone and gave it back the very same day. And you know what: it should have been Jekyll and Hyde which won the Tony for Best Musical in '97; it deserves it more than Titanic.
1,dear god. Help us all.,"SO bad. I saw this on Broadway. And I have never had to fight so hard to stay awake. Cardboard cutout sets and the most forgetable music I have ever heard. I even got to go back stage (A friend of a friend, you know.) Even that did not help my enthusiasm or lack there of. I rarely dislike a show. Even the cheesy ones that everyone says are low on substance. But this is the worst of the worst. I liked CATS better... and I didn't like CATS. Do yourself a favor. Help put this CD out of its misery... don't buy it. Get Parade or RENT, or the Producers. Anything but this."
5,a wonderful tribute,"Having just performed in an amature production of 'Titanic the musical' I can honestly say that purchasing the cd gave me some real insite into how the show should sound and look.The singing was superb, the atmosphere that the braodway cast creates is just phenominal it sent chills up and down my spine. The most outstanding number on the cd is 'The Blame' that just blows me away with all the emotion within the song.In all i found the cd one of the best that i have purchased from amazon"
2,NOT THAT GREAT,The opening of this cd is extremely exilerating however after that it falls flat on it's face. I hardly felt any compassion at all for the passengers and with the exceptions of Victoria Clark most of the characters were very flat. Maybe all of that is caused by transition from stage to recording I'm not sure.
3,"Great Opening, but falls short over all","This show is a hard one to make fly. Despite all of the high tech scenery in the show, the music over all falls short. The opening has great potential for a spectacular score, but once we are past the opening sequence, the music becomes uninteresting and does nothing to strongly help the dramatic story."
4,A great recording,"Wonderful recording of a relatively unknown show. Would still recommend seeing the musical live as the recording does not have all the songs on, which is a shame as they have cut some of the most exciting steerage class bits! But certainly gives a good flavour of the show."
4,add to your collection...,"I am yet to see the show (look at where I'm from and understand why) but was blown away by this amazing CD. The emotions and the feelings are captured perfectly on this brilliant recording...yes it isn't a Sondheim, but Sondheim wouldn't want to write a musical about the Titanic! Titanic has some of the most rich and beutiful music you will hear on any other CD. The choral work is stunning, with memorable songs the add a tear to the eye just from listening. Definetely get this one, it is one of those must have Cd's that are on every true collectors shelf"
2,Eah....,"I wish I could draw a conclusion one way or the other but I saw this show in Boston and felt compelled throughout the show to stand up and shout ""DO SOMETHING, FOR GODS SAKE!"" The first act dragged like nothing I've ever seen. The attempt to detail the lives of real passangers really didn't get me emotionally involved with them and it certainly did not flow too well. Like Whistle DOwn THe Wind which I also saw recently, it seemed like the dialogue told the whole story and the music was thrown in to make it a musical. Still, There were a few times I was on the edge of my seat and that deserves something.By the way, since we're counting, I've seen virtually every major show since 1965- not that that matters much."
5,Wonderful and triumphant!,"I sat down after borrowing this album from a good friend who recommended it and immediately went out to purchase it the next day. I didn't want to wait for my own copy - it was THAT good! Although so many adore Maury Yeston's NINE, I found TITANIC to hold so much better promise than NINE and be so much better and enjoyable in comparison. The songs all catch the time period, with the changes in the world approaching and so much more... I recommend this to Sondheim lovers, especially fans of his COMPANY. It was the first soundtrack that came to mind when listening to this wonderful and brilliant show."
3,Don't expect Rose and Jack,The Titanic story just doesn't lend itself well to a musical setting. Or it wasn't adapted well.I was bored and unimpressed.
5,Maury Yeston's Best!,"I have to admit, I have not actually seen the musical, but I have listened to the Broadway Cast recording of it! Great music with an ""all-star"" cast! I HAVE TO SEE IT!"
4,Big score for big boat!,"This show grows on you. There are songs, such as ""The Proposal/The Night Was Alive"" and ""Lady's Maid"" that are immediately likable, and then there are songs that are subtle and character driven, such as ""The Blame"" and ""I Have Danced"" that truly showcase the acting as well as the score. There are a few snoozers (I never cared much for ""Still"" and definitely not ""To Be A Captain"", though it is a nice touch to reprise it as a prayer in Act Two) but overall the grand scale of this musical echoes the ship and the era and leaves this listener with chills every time. Well recommended and sail on!"
4,Just fine.,"I'm still laughing at the reviews from people who count themselves as experts because they've seen ""Phantom"" and ""Les Miz."" (So, discovered Broadway in the mid-80s, huh?) This is a fine musical."
5,wonderful,"This musical is one of my favorites. I am 14 years old and i have see Les Mis Phantom Sound of Music Miss Sigon and Lion King and Titanic is still one of my favorites. I Love the song ""ladies Maid"", and I dream of Playing Kate Mc Gowen someday. This musical is at the top of my list so I encourage you to put it on yours."
3,What the Titanic meant is captured here in choral numbers.,"All involved are to be commended for coming up with theatrical terms for dealing with this legendary disaster. This is NOT James Horner's score for the film. Composer/lyricist Maury Yeston is particularly successful in the choral numbers which express the hopes and dreams which the ship represented. His inspiration sometimes fails him (e.g., in what is supposed to be a big sentimental duet, ""Still"") but there are goosebumps aplenty here."
2,BORING!!!!!!!!!!!,"This soundtrack is so boring and not worth anhyones money. I have seen numerous tony winning plays and heard their music. This is way towards the bottom of good music. First off, it is terribly unoriginal. Did someone say Les Miz? The music is the same. However if you are looking for a nap, listen to this... it'll bore you to death. The reason why i gave this two stars is because it has two good aspects. The orchestrations are really nice, but do not hide the poor score. Secondly, there is one good song, that song is ""There She Is"". This song is nice and song well. It is the sole reason why i bought the darn CD. I later figured it was not worth it. So don't waste your money on this CD, simply settle on one of your mom's lullaby"
1,Confusion.,"I am a bit baffled by those who enjoy this musical. I find little of the music memorable at all, and even the songs with a catchy tune fall with weak lyrics."
1,profoundly disappointing,"I do not understand the hype. The lyrics occasionally rise to the innocuous, but usually hover nearer to doggerel. Innapropriate adjectives apppear to make lines scan, and sentence structure is tortured to force rhyme. The music is a weak imitation of Sweeney Todd, but without a tune I can recall. Of course, I heard this cd at a disadvantage -- the stereo was turned on."
5,Practically Perfect in Every Way,"Maury Yetson with his soaring music and compelling lyrics has createed a show much more moving than any James Cameron epic with his musical Titanic. With songs like ""The Proposal/The Night was Alive"" that manage to show complete charccters in 3 min. 50 sec, and ""I Must Get on That Ship"" dripping with heart-wrenching irony, this Album lets you truly realize what a trajedy the sinking of the Titanic was. This CD is also well put together complete with lyrics, plot synopsis, and additional information about the Titanic. Combined with a stellar cast, this is the ideal Broadway Cast Album, and all other record companies should follow BMG's lead on this one."
3,Well done but doesn't grab me,"Well-acted, well-sung, well-orchestrated, well-written, and bewilderingly unmoving. Since I bought this, I've listened to it twice. I loveNineso I really wanted to like this more. Fortunately, there's other, more effective Maury Yeston scores."
3,Well. . . . . .,"This recording, was, last year, one of the most I anticipated. Well, being the Tony Best Musical go figure. But once I got through the launching and sinking sequence, it went boring, Gradually it grew on me. Songs like: ""What a Remarkable Age This Is!"", the sinking and launching sequences, and Mr. Andrews Vision were the standouts. The rest are dull and I think meaningless to the plot. The words, in some cases are FABULOUS! And some are just duller than dull!Overall, the recording is pretty good, but look in the used barrels first, and if its not there, look in a cheap place....its not worth $17.99 or whatever your prices are."
1,wow...this is bad,"I cannot believe this beat out Kander & Ebb's brilliant ""Steel Pier"" for Best Score of the 1997 season. Yeston's score for Titanic is truly one of the most awful scores in history to walk away with the prize. While Yeston's music for Grand Hotel and Phantom were nowhere near excellent, they certainly surpassed this lousy creation. Anyway...the Broadway company is already long gone and the touring company (if it's even still around) is doing poorly. Save your money. Buy something else."
2,Great For Insomnia,"Winner of 1997's Best Musical Tony (in arguably a very lean year), ""Titanic"" has a few pretty melodies, but no real memorable numbers. Too bad considering the cast: Michael Cerveris (""Tommy"", ""Assassins""), Victoria Clark (""The Light In The Piazza""), and Brian D'Arcy James (""The Wild Party"").That season's other notetable productions (""The Life"" and Steel Pier"") have better scores.Composer Maury Yeston, best known for ""Grand Hotel"" and the excellent ""Nine"", does not create anything special here ... except maybe a cure for insomnia.Get the spectacular ""Nine"" (original or revival cast) instead!"
5,This is elegant musical story-telling,"In the vein of Lerner and Loewe, Yeston (one of the best dramatic composers today) creates a beautiful, impressionistic score that tells the story simply, elegantly, and movingly. The best new score in several years."
5,One of the best---get it now!,"After seeing the show in NYC again last week, I know this is far above the movie--You can feel the drama of the event, the joy and sorrow-- The score is majestic--- even if you can't see the show live in NYC or on tour, you CAN get the feeling...and I hope you do.More than a ""must"" for any collection.Cheers!"
3,OK protection,"Bought as a replacement to the filter that sacrificed itself when my tripod tipped over, lens first.Lots of lens flair. My daughter loves lens flair, I don't. This is now on my backup lens. I use it if I know my lens might get rained on."
4,hey 4 eyes,I bought 2 and built a frame for them. Now I have cool UV glasses and I look like one of the Buggles.
3,Meh....,"It was very difficult to screw on my 28-135mm Canon, otherwise it does the job. I have not really shot too many pictures but from the first 50 shots, it seems fine. For the price you pay, you get what you pay for. That said, it's good for the price I paid. It protects my lens and does not affect image quality. At least not that's noticeable (i'm not a professional). 7 out of 10 stars."
1,10 cents worth of musical pain,"My friends and I found this CD selling for 10 cents. We bought it, knowing that it would be bad, but were we ever surprised. It isn't worth the jewel case it was sold in. It isn't worth the part of a tree the liner notes were printed on. The plastic of the CD would be better used to attach labels to underwear. All you need to see to understand the quality of this music, is the cover of this CD. Look at it. No, look at it now. Enlarge it as much as your computer will allow. Gaze at the tragic face of the lead singer and his three tragic friends scowling backup. I hope they got some trim singing these awful songs because there is otherwise no value to how they have spent their lives. If you want this CD, write to me. I will sell it to you for a nickel, and that's a loss for me."
1,I received a PAL video I can not wartch it yet.,"I do not remember when order to see it was a PAL video. Maybe it was my mistake, but anyways I am disappointing."
4,"Powerful, easy to use and convenient but quite loud","I use it for cleaning up the stray kitty litter on the bathroom floor. (So much better than sweeping!) It gets the job done quickly and easily. The flip-down crevasse tool is handy for targeted suction. Since my operation time is short, I have no problem with the battery life and it takes a long time to fill up the vacuum bag. My only complaint is the noise, I don't know if other models are any quieter but I definitely can't run this with someone asleep in the other room and I can't imagine using it for longer periods of time (like cleaning a car) - but I would use a real vacuum for bigger jobs anyway. Overall I am very happy and I will definitely get another one to keep the garage area clean."
2,Less desirable dirt devil model,"This handheld was not as powerful as others I have owned. The filter clogged with fine dust. I cannot find a replacement filter. I knew it was a bad sign when this model was no longer in any stores soon after I purchased mine. I would rather buy a new handheld instead of a filter. This time I will read rating and reviews, instead of throwing away another $50."
2,Could be fine but no filters available,"I bought this hand vac from [local store] and am returning it today. On the plus side, it's more powerful than some others. The negatives are customer support and availability of filters. I knew that I should not have bought it when [local store] did not have filters available, but I was swayed by the power. A 14 minute wait on hold for DirtDevil customer service resulted in being told that the CSR could not locate the filter part number from the owner's instruction sheet, nor could she find the part through a search. I had already tried to order the filters online from DirtDevil, but they weren't available. Finally, the CSR offered to sell me another filter - guessing it might fit - with a 4 to 6 week delivery time. This hand vac would be dead by then without a filter change."
2,Filter Woes,"I loved this when I first got it, but the performance has bottomed out since the filter is clogged with fine dust and I can't find a replacement for it. I have since replaced it with a Shark cordless which seems better and has replaceable filters.Obviously Royal has planned obsolescence on these things. If filters can be found, my rating would be 5 stars."
4,"A little loud, but not a bad little vac","Aside from the fact that any animals in the house will hide under the bed for hours in sheer terror at the noise level this thing produces, it is a better handheld cordless vac than the Dust Buster. It holds a charge longer and doesn't take as long to recharge when it runs down. It is also smaller and lighter. It's great that the attachments are right on the vac itself, less chance of losing them. The one thing the Dust Buster is better at though is suction strength, I didn't find this one to be quite as powerful."
5,Wonderful Vac!,"This is the perfect Vac if you have a toddler. I bought it for a present for my daughters 2nd bday, she plays with it but it is the best for cleaning up after her food crumbs! It is also great for doing trim, I hate changing the attachments to my vacuum (oreck-no nozzle), it is a lot easier to do the trim first and then clean the rest of the house! Also great for couches but not good for cars!?!?!?!"
5,Badgers...Under the Radar ... Over the Chest,This shirt did a great job of covering the upper body of my 240 pound Marine son whose favorite color is Red ... It looks and Feels Groovey
2,"Not great for ""stand-alone"" listening","The music on this album works astonishingly well as part of the television special (metioned in other reviews).However, listening to the music on its own, it doesn't really work. As a fan of experimental, challenging music, I hate to say this, but: this is just too ""weird"" for a Christmas album. If you do not already have the Canadian Brass' other Christmas album, that is the one to get."
4,Lots of fun,Great to hear a mixture of singing and instrumentation. It's not as beautiful as their original Christmas album but it's a nice addition to the Christmas repetoire.
3,Not as good as their other Christmas albums,"I've been a fan of the Canadian Brass for about 30 years now. I've bought all of their Christmas albums, but this is not quite as strong as some of their others. The high point is the magnificent piccolo trumpet solo which begins The Angel Choir and the Trumpeter; it is absolutely exquisite. However, other tracks, especially The Little Drummer Boy, are ruined by the vocal soloist. The childrens' choir sounds nice, but the kid singing the solo is simply awful. I can only assume he must have been the record producer's kid or something. If you're buying the songs via mp3 download, do yourself a favor and skip that one."
3,Product sent was not what was pictured.,"Although I am happy with the product I am using, it is not the same as what was pictured. The tip of the boom mic is much larger and the unit I received is a completely different configuration. As I said, I am happy with the product I received, but it would have been better to receive what is shown."
3,History,"This book contains a lot of historical observation about West Virginia from a native son. The author makes the culture of Appalachia come alive, dispeling the stereotypes. I enjoyed the author's personal journey - leaving the area and returning again to address the questions that we all have about how our home towns have influence on our lives. In addressing the issue of ""hillbillys"" he reminds us that we can all be victims of others' perceptions. He makes me want to add West Virginia, specifically Appalachia to my travel plans."
4,Very impressive debut album from a great live band!,"I saw Reno Jones perform live at their CD release party recently, and was extremely impressed, so I bought the CD. It's been in my CD changer ever since. There are some nice turns on old faves like ""Route 66"" and ""Love and Happiness"" as well as bluesy originals like ""Young Enuf"" and ""Feed Yur Dawg"". The take on ""Drummer Boy"" (known to most as ""Little"", but known here as ""Killer"") is worth the price of the album alone. The horns punctuate each tune flawlessly, and the strong lead vocals really drive each song. Watch for the breathless ending on ""How Do I Say Goodbye""...Excellent debut album!"
5,Very nicely written,"This book serves two great purposes: 1. As a basic introduction to the philosophy and understanding of what Taoism is and 2.As a great daily reader for a practicing Taoist for constant learning and daily practices. A good friend of mine, who is a life long Christian, loved this book to help her understand where a Taoist focuses. Highly recommended book for anyone."
3,"Item works well, but has some interferences","The item works as advertised, but since it works in the 2,4 ghz range, it has interferences with my wireless phone. And when the phone is not connected it has a very subtle interference that I cannot identify. And depending on the orientation of the bases It can get worst or better. (There is a distance of 10 metres and some walls between the two bases). Anyway I could get them positioned to get good signal (but it was difficult)"
3,"OK, but not the answer that I was looking for.","My kitchen is around the corner from he main TV so when I cook I wanted to know only hear but see the program. In theory this works well but i had lots of interference in the kitchen. The instructions have a warning to be aware of when it comes to interference. Some items to watch for are microwave ovens, electric motors, wireless internet points, cordless phones... Who does not have that in their homes today? I am now using it in the back room to my daughters room, a 10 foot distance."
1,I don't know what to say.......,"How can a reviewer rate an album as ""one-star"", and then write only polite comments? I don't know. My personal experience with this album was unpleasant. Glen Velez wrote some facinating music with some very serious new-age philosophy to back it up. I truly understand where he wanted to go. Personally, this album missed it for me. My chakras (?) did not react the way the music intended. My reaction was contrary to the design of the music."
1,NO Secrets Here,"I have read many books on running. This is by far the worst. Elite runners give you their training routines. This would be OK if one were an elite runner. Some examples are: easy day run ten miles at 6:00 minute per mile pace. If I could do that, I would write my own book. This book offers nothing new and is not helpful for the average to above average runner who is looking to better their race times."
3,"More of a short biography, not the substance I was looking for.","It was a good read, but I was hoping for a solid introduction to many of his ideas. The book details the progress of many of Michel's thoughts, but it does not define them very well. I was hoping that this would help me do further research into Foucault by illuminating some of the ides I have been working with for a paper, and thus allow me to concentrate on certain concepts and search those out in his literature. However, that being said, I enjoyed reading it because it was nice to learn about him. This book is half biography and half academic."
1,pretty weak,"I cannot say I`m scholar on Foucault. However, I`m preparing myself for two presentations in two doctoral seminars. I was hoping this book help me to prepare. It is clearly, for me, pretty weak philosophically. You don`t have any interest to read Foucault by reading this, neither it opens you on the important subjects of this authors. I stop after 2 chapters, what is a honest chance to give to a book. The second chapter of the book, entitled Politics, focus on the personal involvement of Foucault in politics and its problem with Sartre on that matter. I understand that life and subject are interelated with Foucault, but I don`t want to read a biography! Give me the real stuff, what is his damn theory of power! What his understanding of politic is! I can`t believe they permit to publish such scrap!"
3,Emelia,After listen to her latest single which is more blues in it's origin I was disappointed with this CD It was a bit boppy
1,Don't buy this vacuum,"This vacuum cleaner is much heavier than expected. It is difficult to carry up and down stairs.The delivery took 4 to 5 weeks with no explanation.The belt comes off way too easily. During each use, I have to replace the belt.I have gone through 2 broken belts.I expected this with my cheap Dirt Devil, but this time, I bought an expensive version and it has more problems than the cheap one."
4,Platinum Force Bagless Vac,"The power in this thing is amazing, I love almost ever aspect EXCEPT the filter situation. Wish the could make a full size va filter like they do with the stick vacs. Never the less this is an awesome Vac!!!"
1,Insane Ideas No.21 TV-cultre based godforms have as much power as the lwa!,"The above should tell you all you need to know. I was hugely dissappointed with this book. It's all sub-standard, rehashing of ideas done with more verve and poetry elsewhere by the like of Grant Morrison. Avoid."
4,I enjoyed this book,"I read this book from cover to cover and really enjoyed it. It has a very unique perspective and the exercises were a great touch for people who want to actually try some of the things in the book. I like how Mr. Ellwood incorporated modern day icons or personas into magical workings. That will be fantastic for the person who has trouble associating with past historical deities and who wish to use something, someone they are more familiar and comfortable with."
1,product does not work,poduct is real rip-off-- does not shave as well as old blades--too expensive to return shame on amazon for advertising and selling this product
3,Not the same product as in the picture.,What the seller did was he sent me the older version of the shaver replacement head. Not he one he has on the product picture. It is ok but you should post the right picture of the product.
4,Philips Norelco HQ9 SpeedXL Replacement Heads,"What choice do you have. There is only one replacement part for the razor. After I bought, I saw it at Sears for a better price and no shipping cost."
5,saved by a wisker,I bought it because it had the same number that my shaver had stamped on it..HQ 9.I would recommend to any modern person in the East who wanted to shave himself but also anyone else in his village who was so inclined.
1,Don't work,The packaging looks legit but the heads don't fit & are dull No better than what I had in there. Returning them
4,Not bad but ends on a high note....,"The typical shock video , this time of many horrific on camera deaths. The first 15 minutes with be an eye opener as many dont get to see this type of video. As the parading of death drags on, the scenes become a bit mind-numbing and I got a bit immune to the violence. But the best was saved for last. The scene where this STUPID woman got her just ending for being in too much of a hurry. Its people like this I just shake my head at. Over all, pretty interesting but you'll only watch it 2-3 times in your life. Find a friend who has it."
5,A must see.,Well what can I say. Save from this is the greatest. My only critisism is that it's too short. It might be my own cynicistic mind but this is compelling stuff that everybody wants to see - Real life. I'll end now and leave a little message to those who haven't seen it yet. BEWARE OF THE END CLIP. IT STAYS WITH YOU FOR LONGER THAN A FEW WEEKS!! C'mon that's got to be intriguing!!!
2,"Save your money, borrow this one from a friend.","It is ok to watch if you like this kind of stuff, but you will not want to watch it again. It is not worth the money!"
2,TOO VIOLENT,This video it is what it says it is.Shocking violent and even i found interesting as a title to buy it for my collection i never watched to the end it because after a while i felt that i must be really sick to finish it.It is surely unsencored but i prefer censorhip on scenes like that.
4,"Like the movie, like the soundtrack",I'd forgotten how good these people sing. It's a nice variety of styles and voices. It makes for nice background music while puttering around the house.
3,Duets soundtrack,The product arrived timely and in perfect condition. I was disappointed in some of the songs on the CD.
2,a couple of good tracks,"I heard ""Cruising"" on the radio and thought this CD would be great. Unfortunately, I felt that two or three of the songs are excellent. The others, well you can go down to your local Kareoke bar and tape that, it would be just as good!"
5,what a GREAT cd...,"...what was especially nice is that the cd arrived in the mail just as i returned home from seeing the movie. (the movie, by the way, was terrific, too-- and not just Gwynth-- all the actors!) i was able to play it right away...and it was amazing how it brought me back to scenes in the flick...BUT even if you don't see the movie-- even if you don't like kareoke -- this is a great mix of tunes with a great mix of voices..very, very special."
4,WOW! Gwyneth Paltrow can sing?,I was pleasantly surprised at this soundtrack. Very enjoyable. A must for any music fan. I still can;t beleive that Gwyneth Paltrow can sing as well as she did for this. Huey lewis is Superb.
4,Great Soundtrack,"While the practice of actors releasing records is not uncommon, it is unusual for an entire cast of virtual non-singers, with the exception of Huey Lewis, to actually record an album for said cast's soundtrack album. It's even more surprising that it actually works out quite well. First, 'Cruisin'--not only does Huey Lewis provide his usual impeccable work, but Gwyneth Paltrow pulls off a great vocal, possessing quite a lovely voice to boot. She also does a great job with Babyface on (Just My) Imagination, proving that not all actresses lack vocal skills(paging Jennifer Lopez, anyone?). Her take on 'Bette Davis' Eyes' is also a keeper, if just a little different vocally than the original. Maria Bello also aquits herself nicely on 'I Can't Make You Love Me' and 'Sweet Dreams', hard to do considering the originals are somewhat definitive versions. Overall, a great package."
3,Pleasantly Surprised!!,"I was pleased to hear this remake of Smokey Robinson's song ""Cruisin,"" but was VERY surprised to hear it was Gwyneth Paltrow engaging in a duet with Huey Lewis! Although we haven't heard from Huey in quite some time, his voice though not as strong as in the past has retained it's sexy and raspy charm. The true revelation here is Gwyneth's voice. A very hidden talent indeed. I ordered the soundtrack simply from hearing the song(which I've always loved)on the radio. The actual CD is just being released today, so I cannot comment on the entire soundtrack. If this duet is any indication, I suspect I'll be happy with my choice to purchase it."
3,Soundtrack for one song only,"The only song worthy of the sticker price on the CD is ""Cruisin"" and if you just want that song, you can just buy it online instead of buying the whole song.With that being said, I do love the cover of the song, and thought Huey and Gwenyth's harmonizing was pleasant, but I am still shaking my head as to why on earth the writer of this script chose THIS song for the two of them to duet. These two play father and daughter in the movie and given the rather INTIMATE lyrics of the song, this is HARDLY a song appropriate for a father and daughter to be singing to and with one another. So while I like the song, every time I hear it and listen to lyrics such as ""this is not a one night stand, baby"", the thought of a father and daughter singing that to one another is a bit off putting. All in all, I prefer Smokey's version better."
4,"a nice departure from the typical ""Diva"" sounds","If you are tired of Alanis and Jewel and all of the other women who try to sing but truly lack talent, buy this and be pleasantly surprised. Gwenyth Paltrow's voice is feminine, lilting, and lovely. She is the reason I bought the CD and she shines. Bette Davis Eyes is just ok- but it is a tough song for ANYONE. I truly hope someone gives this girl a recording contract. The other songs are fun for the most part pretty good. But I was simply amazed at the raw talent Gwenyth seems to possess- now that is a woman who can sing."
4,Duets,"I enjoyed the film and so I ordered and received the CD. I'm not at all disappointed. Huey Lewis is as good as he ever was, and Paltrow is a surprise. The other artists on the Soundtrack are capable and it just brought the movie back to me."
3,It's kinda weird...but still a good listen,caught a screener of this movie toronto. It was pretty good. The music was catchy...it was kind of weird seeing Gwyneth sing. It's even more bizarre buying a soundtrack with her singing on it. It's all right though
4,Three cheers to Maria Bello!,"While Paltrow stays nice but a little bit weak as a singer, Maria Bello got me. Her ""Sweet Inspiration"" is an as great performance as ""I can't make you love me"" is. The other songs are good, too and it is a quite interesting thing that the actors sing by themselves and do not let other give them their voice. At least on this album they do not have to hide their own voices..."
4,And She Sings TOO!!,"Great Job Gwyneth!When I initially preordered the soundtrack, there was mention of her doing 4 songs. It's too bad there were only three. ""Bette Davis Eyes"" was terrific and she kept right up there with Huey Lewis and Babyface (which is no small fete) for her duets. I can only hope she puts together a Duets II. Maria Bello did okay with ""I Can't Make You Love Me"" although I must say I like the original artist better as well as the version sung by Martha Byrne (actress from As the World Turns - who would have been a great choice for this movie)on her CD. The CD ends too fast. Can't wait to see the movie - of course that's where my fixation for Scott Speedman comes in."
4,Pretty Good Work,"As so many other reviews note, Gwyneth Paltrow is really quite good on all of her cuts (didn't like Bette Davids Eyes, though). I really liked Maria Bello's work when I first saw the movie but it has grown less appealing with subsequent hearings.Arnold McCullough (voice of Andre Braugher) is the revelation for me on this. His Freebird is moving and the duet of ""Try A Little Tenderness"" with Paul Giammetti is my favorite cut on the album. Very nice job."
2,They didn't pull it off!,"Gwyneth Paltrow does have a sweet, mid-range voice, however, when I heard her attempt at ""Betty Davis Eyes"" I wanted to turn my head and look at the floor as you would at the Karaoke bar when someone isn't quite hitting it. The rest of the CD follows in suit. You will get more enjoyment listening to your spouse sing in the shower! Don't waste your time on this one!"
3,Gwyneth Paltrow can sing!,I really dislike this CD One reason is that I only like 2 songs. Cruisin' - Gwyneth Paltrow/Huey Lewis and Bette Davis Eyes - Gwyneth Paltrows and Just My Imagination (Running Away With Me) - Gwyneth Paltrow/Babyface. And she reallys sings. The other songs are okay but I didn't really like it. First I would buy a single than the CD.
1,Duets Is Fun Listening,I brought Duets because of the song with Gwenyth Paltro and Babyface. I was pleased listening to the other duets that were recorded.This is a very good album.
1,messin'with classics in a very tacky way,Gwyneth Paltrow can't Sing.Please!Smokey Robinson doesn't need that kind of Exposure from Her&Huey Lewis's Remake of His Crusin'.as far as Her Duet with Babyface on Just My Imagination it's a far cry from the Temptations.this is a Forgettable Disc.Avoid at all Costs the singing is so bad that they wouldn't even be admitted into a Karaoke Club A Real One.
2,A distressing mish mash,"Out of sheer masochism I keep up with each new revision of Candide in hopes that its crippled libretto will one day be made whole. This 1997 Broadway revival manaages to be such a mish mash of styles that it's not in the running to be considered even a halfhearted success. The Candide is sung by a punchy, lightweight Broadway tenor out of ""42nd Street,"" the Cunegonde is flat out operatic, without the slightest hint of a smile (she's an atrocious mismatch with Candide), and Pangloss is the usual creaky character actor with scant singing voice.There's no need to continue about the rewrites and reorchestrations, none of them sactioned by the composer. Look elswhere for a Candide that's truer to the spirit of the original, beginning with the classic cast album on Sony with Barbara Cook at ehr best and the rousing Robert Rounseville in the title role."
3,Nice Recording Misses Cook,"While it's great to have a new, more comprehensive recording of Bernstein's classic, this sadly, and blatantly misses the mark on one count, the role of Cunegonde will now and forever belong to Barbara Cook. While Harolyn Blackwell possess a gorgeous voice, she can't compare to Cook in the original. The same could be said for Erie Mills in the NYC Opera company version in the late 80's. That being said, the rest of the cast led by Jason Danielly are wonderful...if only someone of Cook's calibre could have filled the void, this would be perfection!"
4,"The Mike Judge Collection is Edited, This DVD is not!","The TimeLife series of B&B; episodes are not edited for content like the Mike Judge Collection. If you are a fan of this show, which I am, you will like this for what it is.My only question is ""How can Beavis eat 100 candy bars and not turn into ""The Great Cornholio""? Cornholio existed long before the ""Candy Sale"" episode aired. I think the writers messed up there."
3,No Music Videos!,"The Christmas special is a favorite of fans and non-fans alike, but this version doesn't have the music videos! You don't realize how much they add to the episode until you've seen it both ways. I wish they'd re-release the version with the music videos included (probably copyright issues)."
5,"To hear, with ears unclouded","This album was a real ear-opener. Every song on this CD elaborates upon the original tracks to amazing results. I thought the OST (Original Soundtrack) was good, but the symphonic suite was brilliant. On this album Jo Hisaishi composes for the Czech Philharmonic, for the European-Slavic feal that the music needed. The Tokyo Philharmonic just wasn't doing the music justice. I was at first sceptical, but not anymore. The Symphonic Suite blows the OST out of the fores (bad joke).Buy this CD if you wan't superb songs, sound quality, and some good Mononoke music."
2,"Pretty writing, yuccy ending","I can see why Elizabeth Haydon liked this book. The writing is beautiful, almost in the same league as Haydon's own. The world building is interesting and unique. The characters are sympathetic, and the plot, while not really gripping, did manage to keep my interest MOST of the way through the book. The ending, however, was blah and disappointing and one of the worst I've read of late, right up there with the awful Sara Douglass books. I recommend it, if you can handle the fact the book will leave you flat at the end, or, better, check out Haydon's own summer release, DESTINY: Child of Sky. See how a real pro does it."
5,wow,"definitely a new twist on the idea of all powerful witches and wizards; the plot is well done and the ideas are fresh. i would recommend it to anyone who reads fantasy, especially those interested in strong women protagonists. i absolutely loved this book and i can't wait for the second one to come out!"
4,soulful and emotional first attempt,I ran across this book in my local book store and picked it up out of curiosity. It's emotionally written with wonderful descriptions and character buildings. Brierley is obviously a curious intelligent healer and the author does a wonderful job of making her a complicated and deeper character. The author does mander some into the history of her lands but over all the book is wonderfully written and I definitely can't wait for the next book to come out.
3,Good but...,"I have to admit it was a good read and I have little to complain about except this: the too frequent characterization. Similar to Elizabeth Haydon's Rhapsody series, this book (and its successor) has a large portion of its pages being just characterization. Characters drive a story yes, but it becomes tedious and really slows the story down. But if you like that kind of thing then I really can recommend no better."
3,RBX is Rough,"Haha this song goes to show the dark wicked side of RBX, taken from his debut album ""The RBX Files"". Not his best song, but a rock hard song from an even better album"
4,This is NOT a dvd-audio,Some bonehead at Amazon is not doing his job. This is a conventional DVD with video- NOT a dvd-audio. Amazon provides no other means of informing them besides this review. Et caveat emptor!
4,motivating but not for a beginner,"I have been exercising for years and found this DVD difficult to do on a daily basis. She does a great job with challenging someone for a harder workout, but if you are looking for a classic aerobic exercise session then this isn't for you. If you want to stick to a program and work hard for results, then try it. I didn't see much difference in my body from the DVD, but I still enjoy to do it occassionally."
5,The Coriolis Force in Full Effect,"I've been a long time fan of Alex de Grassi's guitar work and was quite intrigued to check out this new collaboration with Chilean instrumentalist Quique Cruz. Tatamonk, of course, finds de Grassi in top form but, much to my surprise, is also filled with a whole array of exotic Andean instruments such as charangos, kenas, kenachos, antara, toyos, ronroco, rondador and sikus. Piano, bass, drums and brass compliment all of these instruments and the results are scintillating! This CD has a whole array of soundscapes from ""Auscencia"" which incorporates a breathtaking melody to ""Alba"" which has a smoky bluesy feel to it to ""Sanchaly"" which is a tour de force that unites traditional South American rhythms with contemporary jazz improvisation. All in all, Tatamonk is a tasty fusion of North meets South."
3,Huh?,"When Alex De Grassi records SOLO guitar, its THE most beautifull music in the world. I strongly reccomend these albums: ""Slow Circle"", ""Southern Exposure"", ""The Water Garden"" or the Windham Hill ""Retrospect"" which is the ""greatest hits"" compilation.De Grassi was a WindHam Hill Pioneer and helped set the standard for impressionistic solo guitar and all its fresh, innovative beauty. Its amazing genius.All of which, is not on this collaborative, jazzy effort...bummer."
2,Thumbs down!!,"I purchased this as a gift for my husband, but it is going back. It feels really flimsy (not high quality) and some of the pieces in it are plastic! Yes, plastic with silver coating.Now to find something to replace this set!"
1,The pictured set is not what you recieve,I ordered this set placing faith in the picture being accurate. It isn't what I received at all. The set that was sent is much cheaper. It had different tools and the most flimsy base I have ever seen. I threw out the base as some of the tools didnt even fit in it. You can probably get the set they'll send you for about $20 elsewhere.
4,BIg 4 of thrash all together...what more can I say?,"Great sound and production on this blu-ray. All 4 bands sound great and are fun to watch...not as cool as back in the day of course but still cool. Take a look at the bonus material at the end of disc 2...it's pretty obvious the 4 bands don't click very well together and most likely got together for this tour just for the money. 3 out of 4 Slayer members didn't even come out for the jam with Metallica. But then again, how may guitarists and bassists do you need to do a song as simple as Am I Evil?"
4,Lars Sucks...Again,"The DVD was awesome until it got to Metallica....Most drummers get better with age, but not Lars!! He was playing so fast on some of the songs that you could barely understand what they were playing. He messed up so many times that it ruined the concert for me. Everything else on this DVD was pretty awesome."
2,The worst blu-ray quality I've ever seen!,"I own many blue ray and dvd concert videos and must say that this blu ray has the worst video quality that I've ever seen. It seems grainy much like a picture that was blown far beyond its native resolution. I have never seen a blu ray quite this poor. I would not recommend buying this on blu ray, save yourself a couple dollars and buy it on dvd or audio alone. The audio quality on this disc however, is excellent. I just wish the video could have been up to par. As for the performances, they are all excellent. I did notice that Dave Mustaine's vocals seem to be a little off and heard that he overdubbed them. If that is the case, you might as well buy a milli vanilli or britanny spears record."
2,uhhg.,"Why not put the shows out they played in the US? I'm sure it was great in Sofia but come on, they ain't from there."
4,The sound was off........,"I only bought this for two bands, Megadeth and Metallica. So, as far as the others go, I have no idea. Megadeth pull off their same old stuff, with headcrusher thrown in, and the sound was fine. Metallica was something else in the sound department. I swear if Lars plays drums like that--wimpy sound--please take him off the drum set and let him sell t-shirts. Picture was great. So, I give that part an A."
2,Worst Lars Ulrich performance ever!,Good shows all four.But I never saw a Metallica video where Lars Ulrich is simply destroying ALL the songs! Never watched he playing so bad before. he was basically playing whatever he wanted... awful.
4,gift of music,"bought as a gift for a huge Megadeth fan but the video did not disappoint, high quality sound, and excellent picture!"
3,"Good, but Disappointed.","Slayer is my favorite out of the bands, so I was highly disappointed when the bands got together to do ""Am I Evil?"" and didn't see Kerry King, Jeff Hanneman or Tom Araya. What Gives? Jeff Hanneman did walk out on stage at the end for the photo shoot, but that was it. If I'm wrong let me know.I agree with some of the other reviews, and Anthrax was the best. Megadeth was boring and Slayer sounded like crap. Metallica was good , but it's the same songs over and over again from every other live DVD I own."
5,Awesome Concert,"Unbelieveable set lists for all four bands. The crowd seems a bit lame throughout the concert but all the bands put on a spectacular show. If you are you a fan of metal, this collection of bands together on the same stage is truly an incredible experience. I just wish they were coming to my town."
5,"I missed the last part of this concert, so I had to buy this and it was worth it!!","I went to see this concert at the theatre, and it was supposed to be ""live"", I still have my doubts...Anyway, I was more interested in watching Metallica play live, but they were the last ones to play. I really like Megadeath, anthrax and slayer...but I was so excited to see metallica. However something happened at the theatre and I missed most of the songs played by metallica, so when I knew they were gonna come out with a video I just waited for it..amazon had the cheapest price!I totally enjoyed it!"
5,BIG 4 Rules!,Any fan of metal music will love this DVD. All four of these bands bring it in this dvd. This is a must have for any fan of these four groups or if you are just a metal fan.
5,Have loved this story for years,"My first introduction to The Practical Princess was through a book club my sister joined when she was in first grade. I loved this book, and was anxious to share it with my own children. I was able to borrow this same book, by then 20 years old, and my children (both boys by the way), also loved it. This princess is anything but a damsel in distress, and shows all children how using your brain and keeping your cool will win the day every time."
2,This is lemon but with some work it could taste like caviar.,"This book has many links to some very good html sites. It also has six interresting programs, but they all have so many mistakes, some tags don't work on any of the major browsers, that you wonder if you should really trust this book, well I did not trust it, after a while I bought a book by Elizabeth Castro, HTML four(4) for the world wide web, it's a diammond in the rough, this is the one and only book on html that a student should buy. I am a student at Orange Coast College, California. Attn: Teachers and students do not buy this book until it has been totally revised."
1,Students Beware,"This book is very poorly designed, with errors on practically every page. For a student wanting to learn the basic concepts of HTML, this is not the book to buy unless you don't mind wasting 40 dollars to learn the wrong code, or outdated tags. I am very dissappointed in Shelly Cashman and that any editor would have even bothered to print this."
1,Poor proofreading,"I'm very upset at the fact that I paid for a book to learn HTML and I find myself confused at times because of the many mistakes in this so called ""educational"" book. The format is fairly simple to follow if it were not infested with poor proofreading in the code. If this were one of those books where you have to analyze and figure it out on your own, then it suffices, but it's not, or at least it's not suppose to be. I would not recommend this book to anyone who really needed to learn on account of what they're trying to teach is sporadically wrong. Thanks for your time."
1,THE WORST HTML BOOK I HAVE EVER SEEN OR READ!,"This book has so many errors in it, it is unbelievable and somewhat humorous. I could name a few for example, but you have a 1,000 word limit. I am in an HTML class at O.C.C. There are so many errors that the teacher is giving extra credit for people that find errors. I think there are going to be more ""A""'s than ever before. I would have rated the book 0 stars, but that field is required to have something in it."
5,Great step by step guide,This book is a great step by step guide for people willing to learn HTML the easy way. My personal experience that it has many colorful images that guide you through the process and show you even the steps that you might have forgot from the earlier chapters. This book is used in my college for the online HTML introductory class.Great buy even if you want to learn the material yourself. You just need to find the chapter contents that you are going to be working with(presumably there is a disk or online download).
1,HTML Complete Concepts and Techniques--Shelly Cashman Series,"This is a VERY poorly done book! There are numurous mistakes, omissions, and transpositions throughout the entire book and the figures shown as examples don't follow the text, leaving you to wonder which is correct. Wait until a proofread version is done or find another book."
2,Review from Student in Calif.,"This book was required for an HTML class that I am attending at Orange Coast College in California. I am disappointed at the fact that it was seemingly not proof read for mistakes before publishing. I did learn alot from the book. I had never been exposed to HTML before this class, and I found this book to be a little hard to follow at times. I think that the material is there, it just needs a going through by a professional proof reader before its next release."
1,What the hell is this?,"Typos and such fundamentally infantile instructions. Every chapter explains how to open notepad because they believe we are monkeys who cannot remember such a basic task. Typos. Every exersize begins with ""Start Notepad. Perform the following task using a computer: "" A COMPUTER??? REALLY???? Thank GOD they spelled that out for me or I would have tried to use a shoehorn and toasteroven.Diagrams tell you to look at 'line 32' and none of the lines are numbered. Note even in the illustration they're telling you to look at.I am thoroughly disgusted that the college I attend made me buy this book and charged me $35 for it. I am disgusted they did not even do a preliminary review.BAD!"
1,"This book sure is, uh... a book.","If you are a beginner wanting to learn how to design Web pages, be wary. About half the pages have at least one typo in them. Seriously though, use caution when attempting to read this book, it may cause major confusion or other unwanted side effects. I'd recommend coupling it with HTML 4 by Elizabeth Castro."
2,HTML BOOK AND MANY MISTAKES - SHELLY CASHAN SERIES,This book is easy to read but unbelieveble it has many mistakes that confuse students and some of the examples are not clear to understand. I'm a student at Orange Coast College which is one of the best college in Orange County and I wonder how this book was chosen for this level. I don't recommend any body to buy or read this book to learn HTML because I'm a foreign student and even I could find the errores in this book.
1,Never received,Never received the book. I ordered 2 other books the same day. I received the other 2 but never this one from the seller. Seeking 2 get my $$$ back.
3,lost in translation,"This book is mentioned in ""letters to a young poet."" I think it has lost something from the original language version."
2,Just another recipe book,"I have to say, I was really disappointed in this book. I was looking for something different. A book that would talk about how she gave the food as gifts. How she decorated them. What she packaged them in. Maybe some stories about who she gave each item to and why.But except for a small section at the front, it didn't do that. It was just another recipe book. I have plenty of recipes that I already use and like. I was looking for creative ideas on how to get them. Not another cookie recipe. This just wasn't what I was expecting at all."
2,Old and incomplete,"Although this book contains a few tidbits of information that are useful to an avid paperweight collector, overall it is dated and omissive even for its time. It really has nothing in the way of quality photo's and information that hasn't been done better in more modern books."
2,LEMON!!!,"The first week I had this vacuum cleaner its seemed to work well. I am constantly vacuuming due to the shedding of the 85LB golden retriever I own. After one week of using this machine, I noticed the suction power starting to decrease. The machine would not pick up clumps of dog hair....just after one week of having the machine. I contacted the manufacturer to make sure I had the machine put together correctly, which I did. The machine has continued to work at a minimal satisfaction level. Recently, my golden retriever ripped up a bag of plant dirt and got it all over my living room carpet. I vacuumed the dirt up and now the machine is not working at all. A vacuum cleaner should not break just from vacuuming up dirt!!! I would not recommend this product."
1,Don't waste your time,"What a disappointment! It's really hard to push on thick nap carpet and doesn't pick up on low nap. The cannister is really messy to empty and you must empty it frequently. The hose is too short and while using the hose, the vacuum repeatedly tips over and whacks you. I've been disappointed in it from the beginning and now after less than a year, the motor is burnt out. You'd be better off spending a little more and getting something better."
1,Broke in 4 Months,"Don't be fooled as I was with this vacuum. Oh, it worked great for almost four months, then the beater bar broke. Called Target, NO Help. It was past their 90 return policy. No problem, vacuum warranted for 3 years by Dirt Devil, NOT. Only some parts are under warranty according to Dirt Devil. They didn't say what parts where warranted. I called the Target Store in Bridgeport WV, talked to Chris. He was very unconcerned about my problem and offered no solution. Dirt devel also seemed to think they were not responsible for my problem and were very unconcerned as well. Looking for a reliable vacuum ? Shop where you have been treated well before when problems arrive. If you are having problems like I did check with your state consumer's board. There are consumer protection laws which protect buyer from misleading representation. Want more information, e-mail me at LLWWVA@aol.com I will be very surprised if this makes the reviews. Larry"
1,WORST PRODUCT I EVER OWNED,The vacuum is very clumsy. The attachments do not fit right and constantly fall off. The belt breaks every few months and takes 2 adults and alot of effort to change. The cord doesn't retract and within one month the plastic clip that held the cord was so cheap it broke off. The HEPA filter is a nightmare with this thing and keeps falling off and is difficult to reattach. This was a mistake I will never repeat.
1,Won't Buy Another Dirt Devel,"I wrote a review on this vacuum. I made two mistakes. First mistake is I wrote a review on this model, when in fact it was a Dirt Devel Vision Turbo I purchased. The second mistake was Buying the other model Dirt Devel. Take my comments and apply them to the other model."
2,What a mess...,"I bought this vacuum a few months ago, and at first I thought it was fantastic. Now, everytime I use it, this horrible burning rubber smell fills my house and dust flies out of the front causing more of a mess then when I started. I've taken it apart to see if there is any clogs or loose hoses/wires and I've found nothing, I'm afraid that if I try to get it fixed it will cost more then it would to replace it... I'm not sure if I should just send it back to the ""dirt devil"" himself..."
2,belts!,Where do you buy the appropriate belt? They really need to market the parts a little better and make it easier for a customer to buy at local store.
1,Disappointed....,"I purchased this vacuum cleaner a little more than a year ago. It started to smell like burning, and the motor died. The cost of replacing the motor was too great, and I had to throw this vacuum out and buy another. I would advise against buying this unit, as it did not last much past its one year warranty. Hopefully my new vacuum will last for a few years..."
3,where can you find filters,"The vaccum works ok, but our filter is a mess and I have looked everywhere to find these filters. Not even target sells the filters."
5,Good Deal!,"My husband and I received this vacuum as a wedding gift. I wanted a really good vacuum cleaner that had great suction (considering we had new carpet in our new house, which creates a lot of dust on the floor). But, much to our surprise this was the vacuum cleaner we wanted and needed. I have had no problems with it whatsoever. It is very easy to push and we both love it. This was definitely a great gift. And I recommend it to anyone. You will be glad you bought it."
2,Dirty Devil,The design of the filter and dirt container make it very difficult to empty without creating a mess. Needs some usability testing.
5,Sucks!,That's a good thing when it comes to vacuums. I like seeing the dirt that comes up because I know the vacuum is doing it's job. It is light enough for me to carry up and down the stairs and easily maneuverable through the entire house. It does wonders for our area rug--our last vacuum didn't.
2,Filters??,"I find this vacuum mediocre at best. The suction is OK, but not anything stellar. It is impossible to empty the dirt container without getting a good dusting of what you have just vacuumed up all over you, and the filters are IMPOSSIBLE to find. I have to keep banging my filter on the ground outside to dislodge the dirt because I have yet to find somewhere that sells the filters (I have owned this vacuum for 2 years)If you have a small area to clean, no pets and unlimited time to spend on the internet searching for filters, buy this vacuum. Otherwise, don't get lured in by convience and/or price. The bagless feature is not a convience and there are many more vacuums to choose from in this price range."
3,I finally found filters for this vacuum,I bought this vacuum for the price. It works okay but have had a problem finding filters. I wanted to let people know I FOUND them. You can purchase filters online for a decent price. This vacuum is light and easy to use. Now that I have found filters it will be much easier to clean my house.
3,It's okay,I was attracted to this vacuum because it was priced well for being lightweight and bagless. The suction is pretty good. The only problem is emptying the filter always creates a BIG mess.
1,Would recommand other vacuum.,"This vacuum was the best one we ever bought, until... 1) if you need to replace the belt, the replacement ones are too small. It smells like the motor is fried. The center filter in the basket is never clean. We cannot find a replacement filter anywhere."
1,Disappointing,"The product looks good, but unfortunatley it is style over substance. There are plenty of recipes in the enclosed manual, but the basic product just does not come out that great. Maybe it is that a steam vent is needed or perhaps the popping place is too small. I would recommend you save money, time and hassle and take a look at the West Bend Stir Crazy popcorn maker instead."
2,Junk,"The top traps the steam so the corn comes out soggy. After about a year of use, the spin-arm on mine jammed. I was dissapointed because I really trust Cuisinart."
2,overheats when used twice in a row,"after i drilled holes near the top of the bucket, as others have mentioned, the popcorn was quite good - and provided enough for our family of five to eat.the problem we have with this unit is that it overheats after one batch - in reading the owners manual, it even says it will(!) - and there is a cut-out that turns it off until it cools down.if you only want to run it once, and you can drill holes in it, i guess it's okay.if you want to supply a family with popcorn for the duration of a movie, find something else that works when used continuously."
1,Disappointment,"My husband bought this for me, but the machine makes really tough and bad tasting popcorn. After 2 uses, the locking tabs on the handle of mine broke off. Very disappointed in this product."
1,Soggy Popcorn,"My review is consistent with the other negative reviews. The idea to make perfect popcorn in a serving bowl is genius. Also the easy clean design is a must. The only problem is the soggy, styrofoam like texture of the popcorn. After chewing several mouthfuls, my jaw began to ache. Perhaps I'm getting these results due to highly humid area in which I live. Nevertheless, I retuned this product to the retail outlet."
3,Modified to work properly,The design of the Cuisinart CPM-800 is very eye appealing and would be a nice corn popper if the design allowed the water vapor to escape during popping. The unit traps moisture in the clear tub that is inverted over the heating unit. During the popping process water vapor is trapped with inside the clear tub making the pop corn soggy.I drilled holes into the plastic around the clear plastic tub to allow the water vapor to escape. This solved the soggy popcorn issue.For an expensive unit you would expect Cuisinart to perform a failure mode field test prior to releasing this product. From Cuisinart I would expect some quality.
2,"Soggy popcorn, weird taste, poor customer service","I love cuisinart. I love popcorn. So, naturally, I got one of these (as a gift, actually). First bowl was soggy, and had a very strange taste. Tried another, with different popcorn and a new bottle of oil. Same results. Maybe some manufacturing coating? I washed it very well, made three more bowls, and no change. Surely I'm doing something wrong, they couldn't possibly have sent out a popcorn popper that gives results like this. So I try to contact customer service. In a few days (!) I receive a form email back that had no relation to my problems (soggy popcorn with a strange taste). I tried, really I did, and when Cuisinart wouldn't even respond to my problems, I just packed it up and sent it back. Looking forward to version II...."
1,Disappointing,"We spent the extra money to get Cuisinart and hopefully a higher quality product. We concur with the other bad reviews. We tried more than one brand of popcorn, oil, toppings with no success - All of them turned out soggy.The book recommends baking for 15 - 20 min. after popping for more crispiness (so much for convenience). This was better than before but still not crispy.We are returning it."
1,Shame on you Amazon!,"There were many reviews for this popcorn popper--almost all gave it 1 star. They are all gone, except this new review giving it 4 stars. Very deceptive advertising, Amazon. This popcorn popper makes soggy, inedible popcorn. There are no air holes to let the steam out. You would know this if they had not removed all of the past reviews."
1,Don't waste your money on this popper!,Thought I had found a quality popcorn popper when I found this but it only worked for about a year or so and then the spinner stopped spinning. When I contacted Cuisinart they asked for money just to ask a question. Of course I paid nothing more to them. They offer no support or repairs for their products. I highly recommend to everyone to stay away from Cuisinart products altogether. Who wants to buy a product from a company that runs from the people who pay them?There is a 'LIMITED' 3 year warranty on the product if you want to ship it off to New Jersey for an additional fee of $10 plus postage. It's not worth it to me.
2,High Hopes were Dashed,I was so excited when I rec'd this popcorn popper as a gift. It seemed like such a great idea for a frequent popcorn popper like myself. And I thought anything made by Cuisinart would be quality! I was wrong on two counts. The plastic top does not allow steam to vent so the popcorn gets soggy AND then the oil drips thru the center of the hotplate onto the hot coils below and causes quite a mess. I finally threw it out.
1,"Bad, soggy popcorn!","I was excited about this machine, too. But the reviews are right, it makes soggy popcorn. I thought about drilling holes in the top of plastic to let the steam escape, but then why should I pay $50 for something that doesn't work properly!"
1,Poor Quality,"This appliance is very poor quality considering the brand. We bought one of these in January and with limited use, it broke down in June. For $ 10.00 plus our shipping costs, Cuisinart replaced it. That one broke the second time we used it! By the time I return this, I could have purchased a product of higher quality for less money."
1,Broke for a second time,After using the machine for about 3 months the heating element broke. Cuisinart supplied us with a new unit but within 3 months the machine broke again. I would strong suggest buying a different popcorn maker.
1,Junk -- Cuisinart terrible customer service,"I ordered this in Sept. 2005, and during the first use, it stopped working. I immediately called Cuisinart customer service for a replacement -- not only do I have to pay to send back the hunk of junk, but I also have to pay for them to ship the new item. BUT WAIT -- IT GETS BETTER! I finally got the replacement March 2006 and am told that my three year warranty on the new product begins a month before I bought the original hunk of junk! Because they took their sweet time, I have lost nearly 7 months of warranty time for an item I bought and have yet to use it one complete time successfully! They told me that there was absoultely nothing they could do about it. UNBELIEVABLE -- talk about terrible customer service policies. That is the last time I am fooled by Cuisinart (Conair) -- I will never buy another product from them!"
1,Wish Zero Stars was an option,"If you like wet soggy popcorn and gadgets that make life tougher, this is the toy for you! It holds in all the steam so when you flip over the handy dandy now-it's-a-lid, now-it's-a-bowl gizmo, your popcorn is sitting in a puddle of water. We've had ours three weeks and the handle broke already so you have to hold it down while the popcorn pops, otherwise the auto-shut off kicks in. If anyone wants one for free, it will be out on the curb with the rest of my trash this week. It's so not worth sending in for repair."
1,"No soggy popcorn, BUT!","We have not had a problem with soggy popcorn or bad smells, but our popper shuts off on some kind of internal overload after two batches. The last time it went off halfway through the second batch. It does cool off and starts working again, but it takes about five to seven minutes."
2,Makes Chewy Popcorn,"I was very disappointed in this item. I have other Cuisinart appliances and thought this one would live up to Cuisinart's excellence. I was wrong. So much steam builds up in the cover/bowl during popping that the popcorn gets wet, resulting in chewy popcorn. Not crisp at all. I've tried 3 different oils and 3 different types of kernels and there has been no difference. The instruction book does suggest putting the popped popcorn on a cookie sheet in the oven for 15 minutes after popping for better flavor. This does make the popcorn more crisp and does make it taste much better. I will no longer eat the popcorn without following this step. It really does help the taste. Unfortunately, my popping process is now about 20 minutes instead of 5."
3,Fixing the popper,"I agree with the reviews that said that the popcorn was not crunchy because too much steam built up inside; also about the weird taste and the burning popcorn. First, like all metal/mechanical items there is residual oil on the parts, so thorough cleaning prior to use is necessary. Still the oily smell will continue through a couple uses. As far as the steam build up, I drilled a series of small holes in the top of the plastic to release the steam. Works much better. And as far as the burning, use 1 tablespoon oil and 1/3 cup kernels; no more. If you already own it, those are some tips; if you are thinking of buying it, you might look elsewhere."
2,Save your money,"Like some of the other reviewers I too love most Cuisinart products, but I am not fond of this one. First it only makes a small amount of popcorn if you are using Black Jewel or Blue Mountain popcorn,something to do with the dense kernels I guess,also I had a bad connection on the popper plate after only the first use and have to put it together just right or it does not work.The design is a little dangerous in my opinion since you have to flip the hot plate over into a bowl, definitely not kid user friendly. The popcorn is not very tasty unless you doctor it up with lots of salt, butter or other seasonings. I would pass on this one."
4,Don't Put The LID ON WHILE POPPING,"Hello Amazon Reviewers. Wow! I have been reading the 1 and 2 star reviews and it sound like you were keeping the LID on the popping bowl while popping. Yes, this will create steam and soggy pop corn, for sure. After my popping session is completed I turn the bowl upside down and into another bowl. Do not, I repeat, do not use the lid as it will make your popcorn soggy, even for a spit second. Try to transfer without lid. It's easy, once you figure out the method. My popcorn comes out super crispy. I would of given 5 stars, but I find the bowl thingy a bit awkward to clean, by hand that it.....back to my bowl of pc."
2,Very Excited .....at first,"I was very excited to receive this popper for my birthday. I LOVE popcorn, have it almost daily. The popcorn it makes is not crunchy because there are no vents in the lid, well, I soon remedied that, one day I dropped it and it cracked. Even the cracked lid did not keep me from daily use of the popper but then it just didn't work. I jimmied it and it began working again...for a while. The red base cracked and it was all downhill from then on, I'd say the popper lasted a little over a year. I think there is a manufacturing flaw because a friend who has the same popper (longer than I) also has a problem with the base connecting with the plate mechanism. It just won't rotate if you don't re-adjust it."
1,Always Breaks....stay away from this product,"I have two homes both with this popcorn maker....we like how it pops, but each have broken within several weeks of use ( failed to heat), then I replaced them and those too broke, I then had Cuisinart send me news ones ( had to pay to ship ) and they too broke. I found a microwave popcorn maker at Target for $10 that works just as well and there are no parts to break. Very poorly manufactured.....made in China."
2,not worth it,"Better off buying microwave popcorn. Quite a few kernals left in the bottom, tasted terrible, didn't matter how much or how litle oil was used - the popcorn that did pop was mushy. This unit has been buried in the cabinet for the past year and will be gone at the next garage sale."
2,Makes bad popcorn - bad designed unit,"I have tried many different types of popcorn oil and popcorn kernels to get a good tasting popcorn out of this unit. But all attempts failed. What it comes down to is this, the unit traps the steam from the popping process inside the clear plastic bowl that becomes your dispensing bowl. A Quote from another reviewer here, L ODonnell, said this ""tough, rubbery, styrofoam-textured corn. Plus, the popped corn had a weird taste"" hits the results of what you get right on the head. The unit looks great but has bad function as its designed purpose in life."
1,Soggy and sorry,"If they made the lid out of meshwire instead of plastic, water wouldn't condense on the inside and make the popcorn all soggy. I tried to fix the problem by drilling about thirty 1/4"" holes on the top to let the steam out. It helped a little but not enough. Then I put a bunch of holes at the bottom of the lid so that air could circulate. That helped a bit more, but when the popcorn rises above the level of the holes, it blocks off the holes. All in all, this thing sucks because the popcorn comes out soggy. Now that might be a plus if you like chewy popcorn, but I much prefer crunchy popcorn. I'm a sorry fella for spending $30 on this piece of junk. Back to my old Sunbeam air popper that ejects unpopped kernels."
1,"Soggy, Smelly Popcorn","I am a little confused by any rating over 1 star! I have to agree with most - this simply does NOT work! The steam builds up and my husband, who usually eats most anything, would not eat the popcorn because it tasted funny.Back to the Whirley!"
5,Astaire/Crosby are pure magic.,"The stars are what makes this movie one of the best. Everyone knows about the ""Puttin' on the Ritz"" number but Crosby's rendition of ""Blue Skies"" is the definitive version of that song. As a Fred Astaire and Bing Crosby fan, this and ""Holiday Inn"" are what musicals should be, light and completely fun."
3,Worth watching for one dance number...,"Fred's Putting On The Ritz absolutely makes the movie. Without it, the movie would be forgettable but that dance routine is my favorite of all Astaire's efforts. Amazing!"
3,"Astaire's ""Ritz"" Alone Makes Film Worthwhile","Fred Astaire's dancing and Bing Crosby's singing: wow, not a bad combination! As good as Bing's voice was, I preferred seeing Fred dance so the picture is only so-so for me. Either way, you'd think with these two stars, this musical would be tremendous, but it isn't.Astaire has three of his four dance numbers in the first half of the movie. One of them, ""Puttin' On The Ritz,"" is one of the most impressive performances, if not THE best, he's ever done. It is absolutely spectacular. The movie is worth seeing for that performance alone. For the next hour, there is a romance gone sour and Crosby's crooning (some good songs, some bad).The film's intent was to pay tribute to Irving Berlin and all the music he gave us, and it succeeds on that level. There are nothing but nice people in the movie and tons of music.....but the whole thing lacks something."
2,Lazy,"Mummified Bing Crosby musical from the mid-forties, when the old groaner would amble off the golf course and walk through another tailor-made vehicle without raising a sweat. Adding to the atmosphere of torpor is the laziness of the composer, Irving Berlin -- he trots out dozens of his old hits, while his new originals are totally forgettable. Fred Astaire was a late addition to the cast, which may explain his having the worst role of his entire career -- that of a seedy also-ran playboy who ends up crippled for life after a drunken fall. If That's Entertainment to you, help yourself."
2,Where's the insect swatter??,"What can I say it's a B grade horror flick. If you are not looking for award winning scripts, sit back, grab the popcorn and have fun. D"
1,????,"SEEME LIKE THIS ONE WOULD BE A GOOD ONE BUT I ORDERED IT OVER A MONTH AGO AND STILL HAVEN,T RECIEVED IT???SO I DON,T KNOW HOW IT IS I HAVE TO PUT ONE STAR IN ORDER TO POST THIS"
4,one of the best bang for the buck.,"It is a good solution for those who wants to listen to radio in addition to their MP3s. I have used it on a DELL 610 laptop and a iPAQ 3750 with expansion sleeve. The reception is significantly better with the laptop than the iPAQ. The user interfaces for both are the same, which is good. One bonus is the basic, but, free PCMCIA card comes with it.On the flip side, the disappointments are: 1) no room left to plug-in for both my Compact Flash wireless card and it together for the laptop. 2) To boost reception of FM station's signal, one has to plug their headphone to this card, rather than the iPAQ or laptop's built-in line out. 3) missing record button to record what is broadcasting from the FM station. 4) missing Short wave and AM.All and all, it is good."
1,Terrible video content!,Superb concert - but a terrible Blu-ray with near VHS video quality - somebody should tell the band to get their techs on the ball!

5,Hook!,Bought this for my 2 year old for Halloween. He loved it and so did everyone else. Has a classic costume fabric quality. Hat sold seperatly but completes the costume. I think it is very cute.
4,fun dress up!,My son loves it! Just wish it had come with the hook and hat. I had to buy them separately. Got expensive
3,"Good Costume, Hate it When they Picture Shows Items That are not Include!","Costume is nice, my 4 year old loves it. It may mention that it only includes the base costume and not that hat, sword, or hook. But c'mon, why show a picture of thingst hat are not included? How can you call something a Captain Hook custume that doesn't come with a hook! Would rate higher if I wasn't put off by the slight attempt at false advertisement."
2,Captian Hook costume with no hook,The Captain Hook costume is cute but there was no hook. It was a disappointmentfor my grandson who looked all over for the hook.
5,Fantastic Reference,"Each time I have a PC question, I open this book and find the answer. Very thorough. Well worth the money."
4,Interesting but very biased,An extremely biased account of the Russia/ Georgia war. Good movie as a movie but I wouldn't rely on it for its factual content. If Georgia can be free of Russia why can't South Ossetia and Abkhazia be free of Georgia? The events leading to the War are in dispute and not just because of Russian disinformation (though I have little faith in anything that Putin or his representatives say).
2,Should have been better,"5 DAYS OF WAR (2011) Directed by Renny Harlin.Starring Andy Garcia, Dean Cain and Val Kilmer.In 2008, Russia under Vladimir Putin invaded the Republic of Georgia.A pair of reporters, after witnessing ethnic cleansing, attempt to getthe video footage out to the world.Not bad. Not good. Should have been better. More films should be madelike this but hopefully without the tired ""reporter witnesses atrocity""plot."
3,not a bad movie,"I liked the movie well enough, but I am glad it was as inexpensive as it was. A trip to the theater would have not been worth it."
3,Worth Watching Once,"The first 1/2 was pretty good, then fizzled out. Itsone of those movies if you purchase, you'll watch onceand never again. Its an OK movie."
2,Propaganda movie,"This is a propaganda movie about the Georgia-Russian war. The movie attempts to show the Georgian president as a goody two shoes western freedom fighter against the cruel Russian bullies. It goes as far as revision of history to say that the Russians started the war.Aside from the political aspects, the movie is somewhat cheesy but all in all entertaining. The main character is not very likable, Val Kilmer appears in very short stints only and the character is not developed, then there is the cheesy GI Joe Georgian soldier that keeps appearing at critical moments out of nowhere busting windows and saving the day and always seems to win and do the honarable thing against all odds!The Russians are shown as blood thirsty militia, cruel and unprofessional.I would not recommend this movie. It's very forgettable."
1,"Bad script, bad acting, not a grain of truth",Cheaply made flick created on government's money. Very bad acting and illogical script. Don't waste your bucks.Sad to see Andy Garcia playing in such a bad movie
5,Great songs sung by a diverse group of artists,"As always, Maestro Pavarotti's Modena concerts are highly entertaining and uplifting.All artists sang two songs during the concert (one on their own and another with Maestro Pavarotti), but unfortunately not all of the songs are featured on this video. Another shortcoming is that there are no interviews or any extra footage.It is funny to hear Pavarotti sing a pop tune as it is equally funny to see a pop singer with virtually no voice doing ""O Sole Mio"", but if it is all in good spirit and for charity, then it is enjoyable.If you are intersted in European music scene or simply love Pavarotti, this tape will be a great treat for you."
1,Disappointed,"Bought this CD after having received Duets as a gift. I was looking for a similarly well done blending of artistic styles. This, however, was a disappointment. Skunk Anansie's songs were little more than off tune screeching. And, while I like Tracy Chapman, she should never have been paired with Pavarotti at least not without the benefit of studio editing. There were some bright spots, like Savage Garden, but not enough to make this a CD I will listen to again. Not even Pavarotti whom I love could save this one."
5,EXCELLANT,"This a must video for any who enjoys Pavarotti music. Every year Pavarotti failfully finds a cause to help children of war. And every year his ""friends"" take time out their busy schedule to help him raise money for the chidlren of Cambodia and Tibet. Congratulions must go out to Pavarotti and Friends. This video is a must have. It is filled with beautiful music."
4,"Great music--far cry from the ""Love Boat"" Charo",Who knew Charo was a maestro! I heard this being played in a restaurant and was shocked to find out it was cuchi cuchi Charo! My only complaint is that one of the tracks doesn't play. I didn't return it because it took so long to get it in the first place. Highly recommended.
5,I wish everyone would read this before they have children!,"Though some of this information is a bit outdated, the basic idea that children are born with physical needs that must be met in order for them to develop into healthy and balanced adults is timeless. I loved reading the case studies and client's observations about how their childhood experiences affected their adult lives.I read this book many years ago, before I had children of my own and it unquestionably helped me be a better mother and not to pass on some of the negative patterns with which I grew up. I got even more out of it on my recent second reading.I haven't had enough experience with Primal Therapy to know whether it works or not, but I do know that preventing trauma and neurosis in the first place will go a long way toward healing society as a whole."
1,don't buy this,"This CD is all instrumental no singing which was such a disapointment, I had hoped to use this CD in my Music classroom to teach the children about Opera but its almost totally useless!"
5,La Price,"I was raised on opera. Now I live opera. This album would be my nomination as the greatest recording ever made by a soprano of an aria collection. As Paul Hume put it when he wrote about La Price: ""They come no greater. Few are near as great."""
5,a beautiful watch,"I am very hapy with my Tissot Seastar, itis simple yet elegant and very finely crafted, It is a great affordable Swiss watch."
5,Berio: Concerto II/Schubert:Rendering/Boccherini...,"Great purchase! Wonderful mix of pieces to enjoy, spend a relaxing evening listening to the first piece which was written by Berio. It puts me in mind of a movie soundtrack and is one of the most accessible modern pieces I have heard. The second piece is composed by Schubert who is always a favorite. Berio's spin on this piece is innovative and very well done. The third is a piece originally by Luigi Boccherini, a Italian who wrote for the Spanish court. Berio adds a steady drumbeat to the background and blends the music almost into a medley of the original. It is a very catchy tune that you will find yourself whistling to, if you can whistle."
2,"My dog loved it, but it didn't last long","My very average chewing dog was done with it in under 5 minutes. I was hoping that for this kind of money this bone would last a little longer. Next time, I'll simply get her rolled pig skins. They last about 10 minutes, are filled with yummy paste and they cost so much less."
1,"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible!","The dialogue is so bad that you will feel dumber after reading this book. Why can't they ever write decent intelligent dialogue in these books? Why can't they write dialogue that matches the character that says it? If an intelligent character says it, then it should come out intelligent. This is the worst portrayal of the Xmen. This real-life display that supposedly mimicks the Xmen live-action films is so sub-par that the author/publisher should be planting one tree a day for a whole year for all the paper that was wasted in printing this book."
1,Better Look Elsewhere,My daughter's fisher price does a better job than this thing. Has to be the worst vacuum ever made. Motor burned up during 2nd use. Stay clear of this one!
1,Ms.,"Dirt Devil Featherlite Plus by far the WORST vaccum I've ever used--a broom is better than this thing. Not only is it a noisey contraption, it overheats, blows dirt everywhere, and does not have good suction. Stay away from this one!!!"
1,Awful vacuum cleaner,"This is the most awful vacuum I have ever owned. I literally have to stuff cotton balls in my ears when vacuuming because it is so loud. Also, it has almost no suction power- I think sweeping the carpet with a broom would probably be just as effective. I will NEVER purchase another Dirt Devil and would never recommend this brand to anyone."
2,Disck is fine; not as good a deal as I thought,"I thought this was a great deal on a box of these disks... looking at the $100+ suggested retail price. I got ONE disk, and the shipping cost more than the disk itself, which would not have been bad if it was a BOX of disks, but for one, I would have been better off going to a local body shop, or buying several at once."
1,Not as good as Snows,I bought these because of the reviews. I was disappointed. I like the chewiness of clams and the texture and these clams have neither. They don't even taste like clams as far as I am concerned. I will go back to snows!
1,Glad I read the other reviews!,"Like others who reviewed this soundtrack, I found the song list very lacking. The movie made it seem like tons of great songs would be available, but hardly any of them were. Instead of buying the cd, I've downloaded them & found the ones I wanted. Why buy the cd if you know it isn't what you want?"
2,What Happened to all the songs PROMISED??????,"Like so many other customer reviewers, I'm very disappointed with the outcome of this CD. We waited many weeks for the CD to come out, and it is very limited. Please don't get me wrong, I like the music by John Debney, there just needs to be more. There were many wonderful songs used in the movie that aren't anywhere to be found here. A MAJOR disappointment for me is that the song, Ziplock, by LIT is not on the CD as was advertised for the advance sales. Bottom line: only for the BIGGEST fans of either the movie The Replacements or for JOHN DEBNEY."
1,Ainda no recebi meu pedido,"A previso para entrega do meu pedido era dia 14 de maio mas atÃ© agora, 24 de maio, ainda no recebi nada."
4,good movie,"a movie you can sit back and watch and if you fall asleep, you can start all over again from the beginning I like to watch this movie over and over"
1,"mising the best track in the movie --- ""We could be Heroes""","This is missing the best track in the movie - the cover of ""Heores"" by the Wallflowers"
1,HELP ME IDENTIFY THIS SONG,I am searching for the name of the song played in the bar scene after the team won their 1st game. The team and the cheerleaders were celebrating in the bar. The song was playing just before Falco announced that Martel had crossed. Can you help me?
1,WHERE DID ALL THE GOOD SONGS GO?,"I must agree with others when to say the least I was extremely disappointed. The movie offered such a wonderful range of songs that inspired the movie and motivated me enough to want to buy the soundtrack after seeing it once. I was extremely disappointed they did not include ""heros"" by David Bowie, performed by FONT 48? It was a wonderful song...as well as many others they neglected to include. This CD could of been a wonderful collection of energyzing songs, instead it lists a few ""with words"" and rest is instrumental...not what I had in mind at all when I purchased it! A very disappointed fan."
3,Replacements Soundtrack,I thought the music in the movie was better. Listening to the soundtrack I didn't remember any of these songs.
2,These tracks need replacements,"When I first saw the movie, 'The Replacements' I was literally astounded at how many different songs the movie used. This movie was stocked full of tunes ranging from classic to top 40 to jock jams. Now that it's out I would like to smack the team that put this CD together. Make no mistake, the content of the CD is good, but it has nowhere near the potential it could have had. Missing from the CD are great classics such as Queen's 'We will rock you' and 'Every Move you Make' by the Police. I would have to see the movie again to compile a complete list of what is missing but trust me, it's A LOT. It's a dissapointing end to over a month's long wait for this soundtrack. If the price is right I would recommend it but you wouldn't catch me paying more than $15 for it."
2,Just about bought it......,"I was quite impressed with the music selections that accompanied the movie and I was certainly hoping that most, if not all, the songs would be on the soundtrack CD. I was just about to order the CD, but then I read the reviews and I have to quite agree that if the majority of the songs from the movie never made it to the disc, then count me out!! I won't be buying this one.Thanks for the timely reviews."
1,The Replacements,"This is one of the worst soundtracks I have ever purchased. The music in the movie was really good, but they didn't include any of the good songs on the soundtrack."
2,very disappointed,"I was very disappointed when the cd was finnaly released and I noticed that it did not have the song ""Heros"" by David Bowie on the soundtrack when I heard the song in the movie. to be exact it was the second to last song in the movie. Overall I was not happy that it did not have maybe the best song in the movie on the soundtrack."
1,Like a Rolling Stone,I was very excited about the soundtrack coming out with so many Rolling Stones songs in one movie. Unbelievable. Where are they on the soundtrack? The movie must have had 4 or 5 incrediable songs from the Rolling Stones but it seems that it didnt make it to the soundtrack. Very Strange. I am not buying this one!
1,Where is it?,"Where is all the good music of the movie? I was crazy looking for the soundtrack and I am so dissapointed. I liked the movie and the music was excellent but the soundtrack, I'm sorry, but it sucks!"
2,Where Did All The Good Songs Go???,"I have to agree with most of the other reviewers . . . the good songs are glaringly absent. I had to order my copy and had to call several different record stores to even get one to do that! I enjoyed what songs (with singing) from the movie there were, especially ""The Look In Your Eyes."" I was also hoping for the Lit song. It doesn't look promising for another offering from this movie for an additional soundtrack CD, but they seriously need to consider it. I'd have to say they ""dropped the ball"" on this one."
2,Much Dissapointment,"I was expecting an amazing soundtrack!!! But wow, what a let down. Just to warn anyone who wants this CD, it is NOT what you are wanting. All the awesome songs aren't on here. Not even the classic Sting, ah well, just to let you know."
1,The Replacements Supposed Soundtrack,"The Replacements is a great feel good movie filled with laughs and a few good lessons. The music in the movie was great and added to the enjoyment of watching it so of course I was eager for the soundtrack. What a disappointment!! It uses the term ""soundtrack"" in the loosest possible way. Classic songs, the ones that would make you recall a scene from the movie, are all but missing. The only song that is a legitimate soundtrack item is ""I Will Survive"". The rest is wasted space. It is not worth the price!!! Buyer beware......."
1,This Blows,"I agree with everyone, the soundtrack has got nothing to do with the movie. but if you were like me, looking for that tune from the bar, its called Everybody Look the Same by Groove Armada, and you can get it off the soundtrack for the Movie the Next Best Thing, with Madonna and Rupert Everett. Or you can do like I did, and download it....you know where from."
3,THE REPLACEMENTS,I don't mind this sound track.I must admit though it could be better.they should have made a double disc to include all the really good songs.It cost me ... Australian dollars to get in the country.It's not worth that but you guys in America... dollars isn't to bad.
1,I Found that One Track,I also found the bar scene track when Falco tells his team his out on the Miss Congeniality CD! Go fish!
4,"""front row music & score""","John Debney is an under-rated composer, when you look at his record - ""Cutthroat Island"", ""End of Days"", ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", ""The Relic"", ""Paulie"" and his latest ""The Replacements"", featuring a great score backed up by selections of pop tunes that fit the story-line nicely.Among the artists - Font 48 performs ""LET'S PLAY FOOTBALL"", ""THE LOOK IN YOUR EYES"", ""SAME PLAY"", ""FALCO DROPS THE BALL"" give the old college try - Bret Domrose ""SECOND CHANCE"", Kelli Owens ""I DON'T WANT TO BE YOUR GIRLFRIEND"", Gloria Gaynor ""I WILL SURVIVE"", never sounded better, still holds up today. The highlight for this pop section - ""ROCK AND ROLL PART II"" performed by Gary Glitter, sure to get the team and crowd pulling together.All in all, Varese Sarabande and John Debney have given us something to cheer about...just give a listen to the opening track ""THE REPLACEMENTS REMIX"", Debney kicks and makes the point!Total Time: 60:05 on 16 Tracks...Varese Sarabande 066180...(2000)"
1,Let Down In Longview,"After watching this movie at the movies, on video tape, and now on cable, I had to have the soundtrack. The soundtrack is like the replacements first game, goes nowhere fast. Bust A Move and I Will Survive try to save the game, but come up short on fourth and inches. Buy the movie and forget the soundtrack."
1,Who let the dogs out?,"Wow! Dogs indeed. I just saw the movie and rushed to order the CD, when to my amazement, the CD is not what I just heard in the movie! What a waste to let that great movie sountrack go. I am a fan of certain movies BECAUSE of the soundtrack. This CD is in no way a reflection of the movie. I am so glad I did not order blindly. I looked over the song list. I almost ordered on excitement alone. I saved my money, yes that is a touchdown!"
1,Thanks,"Thanks, you saved me from wasting my money. Who put this soundtrack together?? The song everyone is asking about is ""Blinded by Rainbows"" by the Rolling Stones, on Voodoo Lounge."
1,Disappointed,"Guess it is a small consolation that others were duped and as disappointed as I...bought the DVD and expected the CD to contain the great music in the film...isn't that what a SOUNDTRACK is, after all?"
3,Difficult read,This book contains lots of historical information that I was very interested in. The problem is that it was written like a text book and very difficult to read. I couldn't read on it for long periods without becoming confused.
2,Disappointing if you like HOT tea!,"I guess since I'm Irish..I have very high expectations of what tea should taste like..and this tea maker does not cut the mustard with me!! It's very loud when boiling the water, it's always cold if u add even the slightest dash of milk into your tea, so bad I've always just thrown the tea out and eventually gave up. The only thing I now use it for filling my hot water bottle in the winter. However, if you still think your going to buy it, check it out in walmart it's wayyy cheaper there by at least by $10-15!!**Update** I've found if you can let the faucet run for a while to get the water pretty hot then add it to the tea maker then it actually brews a pretty hot cup of tea!!"
5,Great Product - Great Price,"For the price, this little teapot is great - we bought two for our office kitchens."
4,Good choice for the tea lovers!!,Nice tea maker and very convenient. The only thing that I miss is the auto programming feature. Other than that we just enjoy it!
5,Tea Drop,"I really enjoy my new tea drop. I love to drink tea because it has a soft soothing quality rather than the kick of coffee. This machine is wonderful, it makes the tea strong enough for my taste and it's just the right temp when it's done. The only thing i noticed is that the water is a bit loud when it boils, however I had the same issue with my espresso machine. I would reccomend this to anyone who likes to have one or more cups of tea a day. It's the perfect little addition to any kitchen and it's very stylish in black and chrome! I just love it!"
4,Sunbeam Tea Drop,"This is the 4th tea drop that I have purchased and being a huge tea drinker, this is a fantastic item. I will not be ordering another one though, since the price has increased from approximately @20.00 to almost @80.00. I don't know why the dramatic increase but it is crazy!"
3,Am I doing something wrong?,"I recently bought this to keep in my office so that I could have hot tea during the cold winter season. I followed the directions exactly as written in the provided manual and the first pot of tea was perfect. It was the right strength, it was piping hot, and the relaxing aroma filled my office. After an hour or two, however I noticed that there was an unusual amount of tea particles floating in the pot. I was confused as to how this could happen as I used tea bags and I used the filter inside the Tea Drop. I thought I did something wrong but the same problem occurred with each subsequent pot. So while at first the machine is great, if you let the tea sit of any amount of time you will find yourself sipping tea that the leaves have separated from. Perhaps I'll find a remedy to the issue but as it is now I cannot give the Tea Drop better than an average rating."
1,not durable,this tea maker did make 2 pots of good tea from bags. would not use it with loose tea. never got the 3rd pot because the carafe broke as i was putting the lid on. carafe very thin to point of flimsy. ouch. theory works. will look for a reliable design.
2,Not good for strong tea lovers!,"This tea maker is extremely easy to use, which is why it got the two stars. If you like your tea weak, this is the perfect tea maker for you. However, if you're like me, and like your tea strong and full of flavor, this is not the right one for you. The tea, even on the strong position, comes out extremely weak. I'm returning mine, and will give another kind a try."
2,CVOGEL,"Ok but the lever that adjusts from mild to strong, didnt do any good. The water dripped out at the same rate regardless of my setting."
5,question for Daniel,"Daniel,I also brew leaf teas....I would like to know if this tea maker allows for a full 5 minutes of brewing of black tea.Thanks,Carol"
4,Thin glass on pot,"I thought I liked strong tea, but with this tea maker I only need the setting for the mid-strength using 2 tea bags and a full pot of water. The tea comes out very hot. My only complaint is I broke the pot when I washed it after a week of use and I haven't been able to find a replacement pot. I've been using a 4-cup pot from a coffee maker, but it doesn't hold as much. Also, I've seen this listed elsewhere for as high as $44 (claimed it was originally $79). I found it instock at Target for $20 and online at Walmart for $25."
4,Tea Drinker's Friend,"I am an avid tea drinker, white, green and black. I received a Sunbeam HTM3 Hot Tea Maker for Christmas. I love it! I save time using this tea maker, instead of heating water, steeping the tea, straining and such. You have tea ready to drink in less time than you can heat the water to make it yourself. I still make tea the old fashioned way when serving in an english tea pot, but for everyday I use my Sunbeam HTM3 Hot Tea Maker. I purchased 2 more makers and gave them to my daughters as birthday gifts. They love them also. One uses hers to have tea ready in the morning before she leaves for college classes."
1,Coffee Maker pretending to be a tea maker,The tea produced with this device is not steeped. The water simply runs through the tea leaves similar to how coffee is made. I timed how long it took 28 oz of water to run through on the mild and strong settings. On the mild setting the cycle completed in 5 minutes 5 seconds. On the strong setting the cycle completed in 5 minutes 19 seconds. This is not a tea maker.
1,Bad Tea,This is not a very good hot tea brewer. The tea doesn't steep hardly at all and there is no difference between the strength settings. The water is also not heated to boiling. It is really just a glorified coffee maker. You would be better off purchasing a more traditional teapot for far less money.
3,"How it works, why I'm not thrilled, and what's good about it","This tea maker workers like a coffee maker, however the ""steeping"" time is controlled by slowing the passage of the tea/water through the tea grounds into your cup when darker tea is desired. With about twice the normal amount of tea, you can get an okay cup of tea when you select the darkest setting. The trouble is, for really good tea, you want the water to be brought to a rolling boil and you want the water and the tea to stay in contact for 2 to 6 minutes depending on the kind of tea and the strength you like. Neither of these things happen with this tea maker so even when you add twice the amount of tea, you can get a darker cup, but you won't get the kind of full-bodied tea taste that tea lovers like to savor.That said, this tea maker does keep the tea you have made nicely warmed, so that is a plus. If you're not a fanatic for awesome tea and you don't mind using twice as much tea, you might find this teapot a nice convenience."
1,not for tea,"the 5-stars are not tea drinkers. a real cup of tea from loose leafs should steep anywhere from 3-5 minutes. meaning the leaves have to be immersed in water that has been BOILED for this time. this machine does what a coffeemaker does. it heats water to HOT, about 30 degrees under what it should be for tea. it then drips the water over the tea and immediately into the cup. not enough time for the ""steeping"" process. if you just want to drink tea to replace coffee and have no knowledge of what tea should taste like beyond the cheap, bottom-of-the-barrel stuff you get at the gas station in the morning, get a coffee pot. it does the same thing.if you are a real tea drinker, move along. or save your receipt."
2,"Tea need to be steeped, something this doesn't do.","The water passes through the tea leaves very quickly, so it doesn't pick up all the flavours of the tea very well. This is especially evident when you brew certain teas like genmaicha, which are Japanese green tea with roasted rice. The tea gives a 'popcorny' flavour thanks to the roasted rice, but because the tea doesn't get steeped, the rice never really has the chance to release it's flavour."
3,Stops working after about a year,"I just tossed the second Tea Drop into the trash, after it quit working. The first one lasted about two years; the second expired in a year. Both suddenly stopped dripping heated water onto the tea and started aiming water at the back of the machine, which meant that hot water recirculated until it evaporated. I forgave Sunbeam the first time and purchased another machine, but this time they've lost me as a customer.And, yes, it does make mediocre tea, especially if you use low quality teas. The water does not heat sufficiently to make superior tea, and the machine works like a coffee maker, so the tea never steeps in water. I was willing to live with that for the convenience of having a big cup of tea to drink while commuting to work. But now I'll go back to making tea with water boiled in a kettle and poured over loose tea in a tea pot. It's worked for hundreds, if not thousands, of years and is only marginally less convenient than the Tea Drop machine."
5,Exceeded expectations,"This tea maker is better than we expected. It replaces a several year old model, and makes better tea than that one, although the difference could be the old one was suffering from old age. As usual, the Amazon shipment arived quickly.Bill M/"
3,"Overall, an average cd","First off, let me state that I have a Bachelor's and Master's degree in music. I have been a professional jazz saxophonist and pianist for about five years. I just got this cd, and I'm not very pleased with the product. The arrangements are pretty good, the band playing them is not. The trumpets miss quite a bit of notes and the saxophones have a tendency not to swing well. The scat arrangement of the Mario theme is very creative, but the singers keep going out of tune. My final verdict is that this is fun, interesting music done poorly.[...] Not a great CD, but not the worst I've heard either. Hope this helps."
5,Great cliipers for a reasonable price,"I have owned these clippers over a year, using them many times a week for mine & my sons hair. They work great & hold a charge very well."
2,Too fluffy,"The most valuable part of this book is in chapter 7 in which he provides the checkpoints for the marketing architecture. McKenna used the first six chapters to create the foundation from which he postulates the need for the marketing architecture -- which is chapter 7.I bought into his reasons in the first chapter and as a result, I could have, should have gone directly to chapter 7."
4,"Has some great new ideas, bad news for traditional marketers","While the book tends to go round and round a bit, its central theme (the evolution of branding to include all channels of access and the need for a new marketing discipline) is very thought provoking.McKenna argues that many of the functions traditionally performed by marketers under the auspices of ""brand"" such as customer service, market intelligence, etc. are being performed by IT departments. He warns marketers that their jobs are being absorbed by the CTO and CIO.His description of a new kind of ""Marketing Architecture"" is very interesting. The book manages to tie channels of access together with loyalty, brand awareness, globalization, and partnerships. I found that the book required me to wrench my brain to think about marketing and technology from a very different angle.I suspect marketers will dislike its central premise. Nobody likes to hear that their job is going to be automated by the guys in the IT department!"
2,Nice cover poor content,"I bought this book as it certainly touches a new subject in business, that of how marketing is changing given rapid technological change. What a dissapointing book! First, there is a lot of repetitive information...""marketing is changing because x,y, and z"" is found everywhere. Second, many of the examples are from the author's own experience, his wife's and basically from every member of his family. I wonder how representative they are of the US population? Third, the book doesn't have ANY single graph or chart, so it is plain boring as you can imagine. Being the authour a consultant, I was expecting many cool revealing charts/graphs...and finally, even if you get the bookm, by reading the first and last two chapters, you would save up yourself some great deal time. Hope this is helpful-AV"
5,Outstanding,"I grew up with Boris Christoff as the King, Tito Gobbi as Roderigo, and Jon Vickers as DC, under Giulini. All three are very distinctive voices.Here the singers are more Verdi's characters than their own, but they are every bit as powerful as Christoff, Gobbi, and Vickers, and in the cases of Jerome Hines and Richard Tucker, more so. Hines' voice outweighs Christoff by a good margin and he sounds more like, well, a person. As for Tucker, he gives a lesson in power and passion. And with versatile artists like Elenor Steber and Blanche Thebom you can't go wrong, and don't."
5,An eclectic must-have!,"To be honest, the first time I heard this CD it just paralyzed me - I didn't know whether I loved it or hated it - it was nigh disturbing. So I just sat dumbfounded, listening to the intricacies woven in. After a few listens I knew I loved this music. It's complicated, technical and intelligent.If Quentin Tarantino had been a musician, this would have been his creation."
2,"Beautiful, but font is too small!","My daughter loves the size and design. The font size it's small plus it's hard to find the verse numbers because they are tiny and are mixed with the verses( I see my little one having a hard time finding the numbers)If I would have known about the font size and numbers, I would have purchased another one."
4,great book,This is way smaller then I had planned on it being. It also does not have any notes along the sides to help my child read it. I was disappointed enough to seek out another book for her. It was not worth the hassle of shipping it back since we live in Guam.
4,Nice product,"Very nicely made product. It was smaller than I expected though. (I did not read the dimensions on it) It really is a ""backpack"" bible. Fits very nicely in my 5 yr old's bad for Awana. Get your reading glasses out to read it though...."
2,"Beautiful, but font and numbers are too small!","I purchased two of this type just different design and both have the same problem. They have small font and the verse numbers are tiny and hard to find, since they are mixed with the verses.I would have purchased another ones if I would have known these issues."
1,Masterworks of the German Horror Cinema,The box set made by IMAGE (not ELITE) does not have all of the technical problems that Paul Kesler wrote of in his review.
2,cuisinart tob 50 toaster,"After only a very short time of having the toaster oven the door is not closing properly. I also did not like that the bottom does not open completely, instead there is just a tray that you pull out which makes cleaning it more tricky. I am considering returning it since the price was very high compared to many other toaster ovens on the market."
3,disappointed,"This toaster oven looks very nice, is easy to clean, toasts well, tho a little too slow but the oven door has to be slammed most of the time in order for it to close.I feel that it is just a question of time before it is completely broken. For an oven that costs almost $100.00 , I would have expected better. If possible, I will attempt to return for repair or replacement."
2,A lot smaller inside than expected.,"With the controls on the bottom, you would think this Toaster Oven is wider inside! The inside is less than 12 inches across and the tray sits so close to the top coils I would be afraid anything that sizzles would start a fire. I can't say how well it works because we didn't try it...just packed it back up after seeing the inside. Maybe the inside dimensions of these things should be available on the item page."
1,Same Problems as Everyone Else,1. The door won't close. 2. The handle broke off. 3. It toasts unevenly. These issues only arrive after a year. People - there are too many reviews like this to ignore.
2,Spend a little more and get a lot more!,I moved down a level from the one I had used before and would not do it again. The little bit more you will pay is well worth it in the long run in quality and performance. I've learned my lesson.
3,Doesn't Live Up to Expectation,"I re-did my kitchen about 1.5 yrs ago and bought Cuisinart appliances. I am ready to chuck my toaster oven. The door doesn't close properly unless you slam it and it toasts unevenly. Sometimes if you put it in medium, you'll get nearly burnt toast. The worst part, the start button is temperamental. It'll turn on at whim. This is after year 1. I previously owned a cheap $30 no-name brand and it worked better even after 5 years. The Cuisinart brand has lately been a disappointment. The only thing they know how to make well is a food processor."
4,So Far So Good...,"It may be a little soon to write a review about reliability, etc. but so far so good. This toaster oven does exactly what it's supposed to do: toast my bread to the crispness of my desire.One strange design flaw however: the crumb tray can only be removed from behind the oven. This means if your oven's on a kitchen counter against the wall, you have to swing it around to clean the tray. I've already made a mess a few times..."
2,"Door closing problem, works and looks great","We had ours for about a month and we sent it back. We both really liked the looks and toasting was very even. However...Closing the door started to require enough force to slide the oven, which was annoying. Now I read others have even worse problems with the door.Also the top metal piece's front right corner, which looks snapped in was now popping out. That was the final straw."
2,Shoddy Construction,"I bought this toaster oven based on the cuisinart reputation and have I been disappointed! After about 3 months, the door started to have problems--not closing unless I jiggled it around for about 30 seconds. Eventually, the handle on the door came off! We called the Cuisinart customer service because it is supposed to have a 3 year warranty. Cuisinart did replace the oven, but charged us a 20.00 service charge to do so. We seriously just considered going with a new Black & Decker. The thing is, the oven does toast really nicely and is stylish.... When the replacement comes, I'll submit a new post if it is equally shoddy....One month on...we received the new model and it seems MUCH more sturdy. It still toasts really nicely so I'm appeased."
4,Toaster Oven,"I only started using this about 10 days ago; but, so far, I like the way it works and toasts."
2,Nice quality but slow,"The quality is fine as all have mentioned but this toaster oven is slow. It seems to have the same burners and wattage as a smaller oven but has a larger compartment, which means it takes longer to get the job done. Aside from that the controls are sturdy and it is attactive. It also toasts very well. But speed is sometimes a factor in the morning rush."
2,"Toasts okay, but two big problems","I purchased this toaster oven five years ago. It toasts okay, and is easy to clean, but there are two big problems.A few months after purchase, we started having problems with the door closing. It wouldn't close all the way. I contacted Cuisinart, and they said I had to pay to ship in back, and pay for them to ship a new one. No thanks - I might as well buy a new one (I didn't).We learned to live with it; usually after a few tries we can get it to close. However, I've noticed that whatever is coating the back wall of the oven is flaking off. It's obviously because of the heat. It hasn't gotten on our food, but it's disconcerting all the same. I will be replacing this toaster oven with a different brand. Cooks Illustrated likes the Hamilton Beach Set & Forget, which is about $5 more than this one, so I'll be trying that."
1,Door Hinge don't allow proper closing- being returned,Length:: 0:27 MinsTo whomever is watching this video - we had this for a total of 3 mths and around month 2 it started giving us door trouble - month 3 the door has major trouble and you must hold it shut for 10-15 seconds before it catches. Nonetheless the toaster is on its way back and another one is being purchased.
2,"Worked great for a month, but...","This oven made some great toast. Yes, I can still remember those days... but, like another reviewer said, the door quit staying closed. After a few weeks of irritation, I removed a screw from the device that keeps it open. No more problem and more great toast. Then after about a year of moderate use, the dang thing just up and decided that it, not me would decide what temperature to cook things at when baking (and it tended to like about 500 degrees. There are not many recipes that call for 500 degrees, especially for a toaster oven. Toast was a similar random process, but the toaster liked both undercooking and overcooking.One important piece of advice for those seeking a toaster/oven- toasters make toast faster than toaster ovens, and this toaster oven makes toast slower than other toaster ovens because it's pretty large (for a toaster oven).Should a $100 device last longer than a year? I guess it depends on whether you ask an appliance manufacturer or a consumer."
1,Piece of junk,"This oven is a piece of junk. Within 6 months of use, the door started misbehaving (as so many other reviewers mention). Once I closed the door a little forcefully, and the handle broke. I called Cuisinart, and they offered me a replacement but they asked me to pay for shipping both ways. This is my first and last Cuisinart item.UPDATE: Cuisinart sent me a newer version of the oven after I complained to them. They have changed the design: the handle is different now, and there is a click when you shut the oven door -- most probably, they have changed the door closing mechanism. So far the new one is behaving OK, but my fingers remain crossed :)"
1,Yet another broken door,"Savvy consumers beware...Our oven door also stopped shutting properly after just a few months of use, and eventually the handle broke, just as previous customers have reported. This item is way too expensive to deliver such a poor performance."
1,3 months old and I threw it out.,"After about 3 months the door doesn't close. This oven is way overpriced. Stick with a B&D; for 1/3 the price. The only -- and I mean ONLY -- redeeming factor for this cheap piece of junk is that it has 4 heating elements instead of the usual 3.3 Months Old: I just tossed this POS in my trash bin. What a total waste of money. I will never buy anything from Cuisinart ever again. I replaced this junk with an Anvil COA7001. Yes, $400 is a lot to spend for a counter top oven but $150 dollars for a useless piece of garbage is a waste of money."
1,The Door problem,"Everything else worked just fine, but for the door to not close after a few months -- and then for the handle to break off! -- is unacceptable."
2,2nd try still has broken door!!!!,"I bought this toaster and immediately loved its larger capacity and the great cooking job it did, but about 3 wks in, the door didn't close. I brought it back to the store where I purchased it and figured it was just a fluke, but once again, after 3wks, the door is again broken. I'm returning it for a refund this time and getting myself a different brand. Too bad because it was great in every other regard!!!"
2,Works great but door won't shut,"I purchased one a year ago and it's great for everything from toast to a small roast. The rack can be moved in three different positions and the settings do what they're supposd to. BUT...there is a serious design problem with the door.After a while, the hinge does not bring the door back into a fully sealed position and I found that it needs to be banged several times for it to close properly, otherwise there's a 1/2"" gap, obviously no good. It's something I've got used to....but I just recently broke the handle trying to do this and it looks like I'm taking it in for a repair.Mind, it has a three year warranty but this is the only oven I have. I would not recommend this toaster."
2,TOO BAD THE DOOR DOESN'T SHUT ANYMORE,"My husband bought me this toaster for my birthday in February of 2006 it is now October of 2006 and the magnetic door does not longer work. I thought this would be a good buy considering the brand and price, but I was wrong. I would not recommend this toaster at all."
4,Worth the money? Maybe.,"This is a handy little oven. It's much more expensive than other ovens and I don't know if it's worth the price -- if I'm still using it in 25 years I'll be able to report definitively. But there are a few engineering problems: The exterior gets VERY hot so finding a solitary place for it in a cramped kitchen might be difficult. The rack must be pulled out by hand -- no convenient door attachment -- and it's easy to bump something hot when trying to remove the food. And the elements are exposed, which makes accidental food drips dangerously flammable. However, it is nice and small, it does cook fast and thoroughly, and everything I've put in it comes out well. Incidentally, I was worried about baking and reheating, but I've found this little oven does better than my big one -- because the oven is so small, it keeps steam around the food, thus preventing drying."
4,Convenient Cuisinart product,"Very efficient and easy to operate. Only negative is that the pan on the bottom that catches crumbs has to be removed from the back of the oven. Not that great when it is pushed up against the wall. Otherwise, we recommend it."
3,Pretty good so far...,"We bought this after another Cuisinart Toaster we had for almost 6 years, started automatically shutting off and having electrical problems.We were so happy with our previous toaster (cuisinart's other popular toaster oven), but we weren't thrilled with the changes they made to that model (the ticking timer, and the sprayed on black finish).We decided to go for it and buy this one.Its really sharp looking and seems to toast fine- that is all we've used it for so far.I really would prefer the crumb tray to come out the front (like our old one did). It really makes it a whole lot easier to clean. I would also think the handle could use some redesigning---looks cheap when the rest of the toaster is very nice looking."
4,"Cuisinart TOB-50 Classic Toaster Oven Broiler, brushed stainless and black","A nice quality toaster oven with an upgraded toaster control. The toaster has a darkness setting and on/off switches, however, the toaster takes a long time to toast. This is the only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars."
1,Poor Quality,I purchased this a year ago based on the typical quality of Cuisinart ..... like other reviews have pointed out this oven has a significant design flaw with the door. After less than 2 months the door started closing only after two or three attempts ... the frequency of successful door closures has now reduced to zero . . bottom line don't wast your money on this one ..... tis a throw away
1,Door Doesn't Close and Uneven Toasting,"I am on my third one, as Cuisinart has already replaced two for free. Both have the same problem: after 2-3 months, the door doesn't close completely.Never toasted evenly either.Don't buy this item."
1,"doesn't last, poor customer service","This was a fantastic toaster oven for three months, and then the door stopped closing completely, which I see is happening to other reviewers as well. Customer service is terrible - just got our replacement in the mail (after spending $20 to ship the broken one) and the replacement is dented and damaged in transit - shipped in a tiny box with no padding. Tried to call them and can't even leave a message to get help - their voice mail is full!"
2,"Looks great, but...","There's no doubt this toaster looks great sitting on your countertop. And when it works, it works great. But Cuisinart needs to do more quality control. The first one we ordered was defective - the cooking selection knob was broken. Three weeks later we got the replacement. We've had it for two months and now the door won't close all the way. Reminds of the that Neil Young song..."
1,Don't buy this one,"I don't know how accurate the temperature this oven offer. But it simply won't do any good job if the door won't close tight.I bought mine in Macy's after reading good reviews here. I regret that I lost my receipt too soon. I noticed the door won't close tight unless I shut it hard (several times). I had to mail it back to get fixed. I am glad that I live in CA and they have to offer me free shipping (both ways).I got a new one after 2 weeks. Yes, the door closed well this time but the handle was broken through shipment. I had to send it back and waited for another two weeks. Finally I got one that is not broken anywhere and the door works.Now after less than 1 year very light use(I only use it once or twice a week), I have to shut the door with force again.Not a well-made oven. Don't buy it!"
2,I liked this toaster oven at first,"I really liked this toaster oven for the first year, but then I too got the door issue so many prior reviewers have mentioned. I finally stopped slamming the door because nothing keeps it closed anymore. The larger issue with my oven is the lack of temperature control. Sometime in the last year+, I've lost control of the bake temperature. I keep the temperature dial turned all the way down and watch everything to keep it from burning in a flash. Unknowingly, my boyfriend turned up the temperature one night based on the package instructions of whatever he was cooking. Not only did the food burn in the blink of the eye, but the plug got so hot that it melted it to the outlet. I am surprised the thing didn't burn down the house."
3,"makes toast fine, but tray isn't attached to door","Most toaster ovens seem to have a mechanism to slide the tray out when you open the door. This one doesn't, so you have to reach all the way inside to get your toast out. Other than that, its fine."
2,nice toaster unless you want toast,"I was given this toaster as a gift. It is a nice looking and does not take up too much counter space. The only problem is that it does not toast english muffins crisp. The bottom element does not get especially hot and after calling Cuisinart I discovered the instructions were incorrect. You must turn the rack so it is closest to the bottom burner. After trying this for a few days and remaining unsatisfied, I returned the toaster and pull out my old Delonghi."
1,Disappointing,"Purchased the item based on reviews. Found the only merit is,possibly, its usefulness as a toaster.(But who needs that if they have a toaster?)1. The door does not close securely unless slammed several times.2. It's very easy to burn yourself. Although the sides remain cool enough, the back and top get very hot. (And it's easy to thoughtlessly hold the back while trying to get the door closed.)3. The oven does not retain heat.4. There is no indicator light to show when the ovenhas reached the desired temperature.5. There is no interior light.6. When baking (e.g., croissants) the oven maintains its temperature by having the upper elements go on. Result: items get burnt on top.I will donate this item to Goodwill (with some apprehension) rather than keep it since it's too much trouble to send it back.BTW, its cost from Amazon ($100) was matched at local stores."
3,"It works, but ...",We bought this back in 2007 and it still works fine. It is a bit bulky but that just means you can bake big items. The buttons aren't the most user-friendly and there's no timer! How can there not be a timer?? I guess I'm just used to having a timer on my toaster ovens.
2,Need to replace this.,"I have liked many features of this toaster oven until yesterday, when the oven turned on by itself. At first I thought I must have hit the button, but nothing was lit up and the oven was hot. I unplugged it and waited a while. Sure enough, again the oven heated up, no indicator lights on. This is definitely a safety hazard. It still works but needs to be unplugged after use. For peace of mind, we'll have to replace it.I have not read all reviews, but I did not see this problem mentioned. This toaster oven is 2 or 3 years old."
3,"Was great, now not so much.","I loved this thing when I first got it. It performed beautifully and did everything I wanted it to. Now, however, the inside non stick coating is peeling off and the door doesn't fully shut which is a problem I've had with every other toaster oven I've had, but they have been much cheaper so I don't expect that to happen in this more expensive model. The drip tray is inconvenient as it's behind the unit so you have to move the entire unit to get it out. Otherwise, it works well and if rolls or that type of item starts to burn before being cooked you can cover them lightly with foil and they'll turn out fine. It's great for baked potatoes and the like so I'm pretty happy with it and so far, it's still working but I've had a lot of breakdowns with Cuisinart products after about a year or so."
1,Should have known from the beginning,"I have had this toaster oven for about a year and a half but we were about to move so I have only used it for six months. I really could not imagine any problems given the Cuisinart name and threw away the box and receipt. Lesson learned! Within two months of use the door hinge started having problems and now we are having problems with burning in bake mode. I don't use the toaster setting very often, I was hopeful that maybe we would get some use out of that setting, but reading the other reviews here it doesn't look too promising!"
1,Same door hinge and handle issues,"Within a few months, the door wouldn't close all the way so obviously the toaster would not achieve the proper temperature inside. The handle developed a crack and has now broken into 3 pieces. Very disappointed. Expected more from a Cuisinart product. Even in the beginning before these problem began, I was disappointed with the toasting capabilities. Very uneven."
3,Top Style - uneven toasting,This was the most stylish oven in the stores and I was so glad to get a color (white 50C model) rather than the stainless or chrome that all ovens seem to come in. The quality seems top notch for a reasonable price. My gripe is that for toasting the top of the bread is always nearly burned even at the lightest setting. If I observe the heating elements I can see the top comes on much stronger than the bottom. While we can flip the tray over and move the bread lower this is not an excellent configuration. That requires sliding the bread over the wire edge to remove it which isn't very handy. I will probably keep it because I love the style but I can see broiling will be its chief function for our kitchen.
3,Performance just OK,The toaster takes a while to toast. Uneven toasting with some areas burnt asnd others OK. Not an exceptional toaster for thec brand.
4,Great with some minor annoyances,"This is a great product, replacing my cheap black and decker toast-r-oven. It clearly is a much higher end product and hopefully will last much longer (my black and decker conked out in 18 months).Some minor annoyances 1) why is there no indicator light or sound when the oven is preheated to the desired temperature? 2) The knobs are kind of strange- the inner part of it turns but the numbers do not, takes a little getting used to.Other than that, the family really likes it. It's a bit bigger than we expected."
1,Wow!!!!!,I can't believe I actually listened to the entire book. The recorded version was well presented and the reader was entertaining. But the book angered and disgusted me. Every negative sterotype about black women was in this book. I enjoyed Mr. Coleman's first book but this one was disappointing at best.
1,Terrible!,"After years of using Wahls which work great but last about 2 years in our household with 3 different people using it I decided to try these because of the 5 year warranty and ""better"" blades. Terrible at cutting hair. Just plain bad. Returned it after 1 use. Extremely disappointed in it."
1,Broke before I even used it,"Can't speak to the quality of the cutter on this because the thing broke in transit. Looks good in the photo, but I've never seen a cheaper product design/manufacture."
1,Verizon makes a great pipeline like CDMA unattractive.,"Verizon makes a great pipeline like CDMA unattractive.Let's start with the the way their attornies bunch up the contracts above and on their site into humongous size paragraghs making it impossible for anyone to read and find out the important detail.Secondly, they take as long as two years to offer the phone features of other carriers such as Bluetooth, handheld Windows Mobile etc.Thirdly, unlike Cingular, when you speak on weekends, Verizon penalizes you for speaking to a non Verizon caller. What are you supposed to do, tell the caller to switch from Sprint, T-Mobile or NexTel? This is the weekend for pete's sake!I just get this bad feeling everytime I try to read their on-line service agreements, contracts etc. I feel they are hiding something and intentionally making these unreadable paragraghs. They could have chosen otherwise. Agree?Where is Eliot Spitzer when we need him?"
3,Dont' expect too much,"I keep my hair very short, so there's no reason to shell out $20 just to have someone run a clipper over my head. That was my logic in buying this, and for my haircut it works great. But for anything more complex, bring some experience. Maybe my wife just lacks natural talent for this but the instructional DVD did nothing to improve her fading and trimming (we just don't try too hard now). It's just not that helpful. Also, it's a big pain to get everything back into the case. Just look at the picture: lots of stuff, tiny case. If I were back in the market for a clipper, I would get a simpler set."
3,Andis 23680 kit,"Andis 23680 22 Piece Platinum Hair Cutting Kit with 4X Power Kit in Hard Case With DVDQuality product, reasonable price. Problem? Shipped w/ 2 taper combs for right ear and none for left ear."
5,Great little inexpensive mixer,"I use this while making interview training videos on an iPad. I plug two mics into mixer and, using an inexpensive cable, plug the output into the mic/earphone port of the iPad. Cranked to about only one third, the audio is excellent for human speaking voices. I am using inexpensive wireless microphones. I am sure better mics would yield even better results, but what I am getting is adequate for my purposes."
1,show and recording a dud,"i'm clearly in the minority on this one.the show sat there going nowhere. the ghost story element was lame and added nothing to the evening. the recording also demonstrates how on several occasions the show almost took flight,yet sadly never does. ziemba works desperately for very little return , she pushes herself and the material to the point of exhausting"
3,Spend a little more and buy a better clock.,"It's a cheap clock in both price and quality. Maybe you'll have better luck than I did, but the clock I received stopped working properly in less than a month."
3,Just OK,This was for am elder person who had trouble winding this as turning was hard & would not stay wound for the day. The letters good but not made like the good old days! I wanted to return for her but she gave it to son.Disappointing for a gift!
2,Plas Johnson? Not necessarily...,"This is a bootleg CD, with no royalties going to any of the artists. The material is from the 50s, and is vintage Plas, but not all of the tracks are Plas Johnson."
2,Dull and Disappointing,"Being a fan of Crowded House I thought I'd try out this CD by Tim Finn Neils big brother. The first 2 songs are good although, not up to Crowded House standards as far as catchy hooks hooks and melodies go. The rest just doesn't seem to go anywhere and it never picks up any steam. The songs are boring and forgettable to me. I really wanted to like this but you can't squeeze blood from a turnip, or apparently a good song out of Tim Finn."
1,"If you're a fan, DON'T buy this CD.","I saw Aimee recently while touring with Juliana Hatfield, and she emphatically expressed her disgust with Hip-O Records, which unfairly and unethically released this collection (see her comments above). Personally, I think she has a noteworthy repetoire of largely ignored b-sides, but the artist needs to have the power of what gets released and what stays in the vault. Clearly, Aimee's wishes were violated by a label that refused to release her last record to boot. Good luck to her in her litigation, but for all of you fans, this is a worthwhile collection so by all means obtain a copy for yourself, but whatever you do, don't actually BUY one. Don't give Hip-O records a red cent until they learn that they can't screw fine artists like Aimee and get away with it."
4,pleasant for collectors,"One thing to keep in mind when deciding whether or not to purchase this cd--do you want to make a statement, or do you want a chance to pick up some rare Aimee? This is probably the only chance we'll ever have to pick up some of Aimee's scattered recordings. If you're a fan of her music, do you honestly want to pick up the Jerry Macquire soundtrack for one song? Unfortunately, Aimee Mann is not a household name and probably never will be due to the mechanics of the music industry. If you enjoy Aimee's music, pick this up for the rare tracks. This is certain to go out of print within a few years. Buy it now so you won't have to spend 30 bucks on it on Ebay someday."
4,rebate?,"Hate the way this album was made, but I bought it without that knowledge. They have preyed on my ignorance as a consumer who always loved her songs, but didn't own any of the albums. I saw it...thought, hey great, good way to pick up some good singles...I'll buy it. Five stars for the wonderful songs. Deduct one on the whole for the lesser ones."
1,Hausmann IS Aimee's manager!,"Reviewer ""A Music Fan"", on Sept. 14, cast doubt about Michael Hausmann's role in Aimee Mann's music. A look at any of the liner notes reveals that he is indeed her manager!It's best to know of what you write BEFORE doing so!"
1,Ultimate In Blandness,"Like her husband, Michael Penn, Aimee Mann used up her store of good songs on her first couple of albums. Her best work--""Voices Carry"" and ""Coming Up Close""--appears on the first 'Til Tuesday record. Though those songs suggested a major talent, Aimee has yet to come up with more material on that level. Instead, she has put out a series of mediocre solo records that have spawned zero hits. As her manager notes in a nearby review, her label passed on her most recent work.Nonetheless, Aimee currently is enjoying a mini-revival due to the ""Magnolia"" soundtrack and her live performance on the Academy Awards program. But, if you actually saw that performance (of the song ""Save Me""), you saw the problem: bland songs.So many people WANT to like her, and WANT to believe that she has another ""Voices Carry"" in her. But if she had that kind of talent, wouldn't we have heard the songs by now?Umm . . . don't buy this."
1,DON'T BUY THIS CD!,"Please do not buy this CD! Hip-O Records is ripping Aimee Mann off ... Universal is at it again! Aimee has recently said she is going to put together a REAL ""Aimee Mann Ultimate Collection."" Wait for that. Don't put another cent in the pockets of slimy record execs who didn't recognize a good thing when they had her. Now they want to make a quick dirty buck. Jerk-offs."
3,Fair but uneven representation of an excellent artist's work,"As with any retrospective, some things have to be left out and others included to aid new listeners in experiencing the breadth of her music. Of course the record company's main motive is to snag new fans and sell more of Aimee's catalog. But that's their job. And if more people are exposed to her beautiful and haunting lyricism, I say, so be it. It's the nature of the beast we call the record industry.""Hits,"" in my mind, have never been necessarily linked to quality songwriting and Aimee's Bachelor #2 album is a testament to craft and passion sans record company avarice. Skip the forced hype of the ""Ultimate"" and go straight to the beautifully resurrected remains of the Last Dodo. If you're not sniffing after the latest pop hit that brings you back to nostalgic reverie of ""Voices Carry"" then you will not be disappointed."
1,Beware of the fine print,"I bought this receiver thinking it will deliver 130w through ""all"" channels. WRONG!It does 100w RMS thru 2 channels only. Other channels peak at 130w at 1kHz. The result is you barely hear any surround effects.Besides, controls are really hard on this, especially when configuring your speakers. The test tone switches from one speaker to another too fast for you to set it to the desired level. The remote control is also cheap plastic.The unit I got had switched speaker outs for right front and right surround.I returned this receiver within a week."
1,Piece of junk,High price piece of junk. Failed completely after only 5 days of operation. Displays code F70. Have to send to Panasonic for repair already. Seller would not exchange for new unit because I had it for more than one week. Their return policy is only for one week!! Beware of sellers who do not disclose their return policies. I paid [$$]. with no shipping charge. Panasonic refused to supply a new unit. Will not buy any Panasonic products in the future. I rate it zero stars!!!
2,Way too complex and failure prone,"The unit I first took home had a blown channel. Exchanged it without any problem other than wasting half a day of my time. Then it worked fine for more than a year. Lately it started display F70 when I turn it on and I have to turn it on and off many times until it comes to life. Supposedly this is a blown internal fuse, though haven't verified yet. The point is, I have had two failures on two separate units in under 2 years. On top of that, I have never seen such a wildly complex user interface on a receiver. Adjusting the EQ is cleverly buried in the most obscure way. And setting up the unit will take most of a day. And the sound is not stellar, at least when I use my large 4 ohm main stereo speakers in conjunction with the satellites. Maybe a sub-woofer paired with satellites would be better? Not recommended."
5,Great Read,Dewey's works are always fun to read. I look forward to each of his offerings with great pleasure.
3,great book despite kindle errors,Terrific book. unfortunately the Kindle edition has numerous errors. the most grievous being the opening chapter was mistakenly put at the END of the book. once i figured that out I enjoyed the read.
4,Great read about the RN mutiny.,Enjoyed the adventures of our protagonist during the great RN mutiny! Looking forward to the future adventures of Alan Leary RN.
3,King's Captain--Disappointing,"This was just ""OK"" compared with other Lambdin books in the series, and in absolute terms. The emphasis on the Nore Mutiny was fine, but the telling of the tale was sheer drudgery and repetition. It left me wanting more, which is not a good thing!"
5,"Works for me, and I love it!","After working 12 hours a day, it's nice to know that I can have dinner on the table in 10 minutes. 5 minutes to warm it up and prep veggies or a side dish, and 5 minutes to cook dinner. Gotta love it.Clean up isn't bad if you do it while it's still warm. I use a lot of water on a wad of paper towels and for the most part it's quite easy to clean. Only some of my marinades seem to make it harder to clean.I've been using my grill for about a year and it still looks and works like new. I say buy it, you'll love it.As for the two sides, it works great for me because I can cook my meat for 4 minutes and the hubby likes his cooked a little more, so we both get our meat cooked to our liking."
1,Amateurish and unworthy,"After reading the glowing reviews on this page, and hearing it compared to John Fowles' The Magus, which I recently read and thoroughly enjoyed, it was an unpleasant surprise to actually read this book. The writing is amateurish, the conceits transparent, and plot laughable. I confess I did not make it past page 50 or so. It feels like a high school creative writing project.Another small criticism: the book is published very poorly...the binding is cheap and inflexible, the printing offcenter. It feels as novice as the writing.Save your time and money."
3,Why so expensive,Why is this book so expensive new? It is from 1996? I bought the used one and saved over $100.
1,"Great concept, poor design.","Great concept if only it worked. Cheap design and poor quality make this dryer among the worst I've ever used. I have thin, but curly hair. Generally not a long or arduous process to dry, but with this product it takes forever. The dryer overheats WAY too eaily and you have to wait five minutes or more to use it again. I spend two minutes drying and then five waiting to start again. Comb/brush attachments are cheap and made of super hard plastic, neither comfortable to use nor able to stand up to regular wear and tear. Don't waste your money."
2,"Great results, if you can get the dryer to stay on","This dryer made my wavy hair straighter than a seperate brush and dryer ever could. THe problem is that it just shuts off. The first time I used it, it shut off twice within a 20-minute period. It wouldn't restart when I plugged it back in, or even when I tried a different outlet. No matter what I tried, it wouldn't restart for about 5 minutes. I've used an older model of this dryer and the same thing happened. I wouldn't recommend buying this product."
4,Hair dryer Vidal Sassoon,"It's a bit on the heavy side, but very effective in drying hair. It has the features that I wanted in a hair dryer."
1,Brush Attachments on Blowdriers,"Vidal Sassoon VS783 1875-Watt Professional Anti-Static Ion Dryer and StylerWhat has happened to the brush attachments on blow driers? Twenty years ago Vidal Sassoon had the only brush attachment drier and the brush was AWESOME! It was strong enough to pull your hair straight and all of a sudden the brushes became soft..why?Don't these companies realize the accessories are the ""magic"" to these driers? I guarantee you would be the #1 best-sellingblow drier out there!!!!!!"
2,It's okay,I thought the unique shape/design would be better and lighter than the regular hair dryers but unfortunately it is not.
3,works great,This item is just exactly what we needed. My hubby decided it was he wanted and took it over. So yes it is great
2,Sensitive ears?,"This hair dryer is the LOUDEST appliance in my entire house. I can only tolerate the lowest setting - Any higher than that and I have to put in ear plugs, it's THAT loud. And the low setting really doesn't kick out the kind of heat I need to straighten my wavy hair. Also, the bristles on the brush are totally wimpy. They're made of cheap plastic that's supposed to look like boars hair, which simply don't grab the hair well enough to do the job. AND - The handle of the dryer is too fat to easily grab and my hand gets tired before my hair is dry. All these things combined - Think twice about this one before buying. I definitely wouldn't do it again."
3,Problems with attachments,"I really like the product but do NOT like the fact that I cannot order replacement attachments when the existing ones break...and they do break easily. The teeth on the comb attachments break off, and begin to tangle hair.Why is there not an option to order replacement attachments? Once they go, I might as well throw the hair dryer away. That's ridiculous. If I cannot order replacments, I will simply switch to another brand"
2,REPLACEMENT PARTS,"I LIKE THIS DRYER, HOWEVER, THE BRUSH ATTACHMENT WEARS OUT QUICKLY (THE BRISTLES BEND/FLATTEN AND FALL OUT) AND YOU CANNOT OBTAIN A REPLACEMENT BRUSH. YOU HAVE TO PURCHASE A WHOLE NEW DRYER AND THAT IS A WASTE OF THE APPLIANCE AND MY MONEY."
1,Highly unsatisfactory,"Vidal Sassoon VS783 1875-Watt Professional Anti-Static Ion Dryer and Styler - The dryer, after receipt in the mail, lasted approximately 2 weeks. It developed a major vibration and grinding and whining sound. We have since discontinued use fearinga potential electrical problem and possible fire hazard. We feel that the dryer should be replaced as soon as possible byAmazon or the manufacturer. Please supply us with a return label so the faulty dryer can be returned and replaced with a new one."
2,overheats.,"I loved this hairdryer for the first couple of months, im not sure if its because my roommate used it too or anything...but it just started overheating really badly.like i would start on my hair and it would just turn off suddenly. so it was a little bit manageable i would only wait like five minutes, and then it would be okay again,until it overheated again. but lately i couldnt even hold it for five minutes until it overheated. so it worked for straightening my curly hair but it just overheated way too fast."
2,There are better like this out there!,"I have been using a blow drier with brush attachment ever since I was old enough to dry my hair on my own. In the past I had only found this style in a Conair blow drier. This time around, I could not find any at all but finally found the Vidal Sassoon VS783 mmodel. The sound is louder which I noticed bothered a lot of people, but I could handle this if it were the only issue. My main issue with it is the drier heats up and turns off literally 4-5 times during blow drying my hair. I have shouldr length, straight hair. This should not happen & never has with the conair versions I have owned in the past. I would not recomend the drier."
5,Best Hair Dyer Ever,Dries hair very quickly and distributes the air flow in a way unlike regular hair dryers that blasts and whips your hair all over. Its also not as noisy as all other dryers i've owned.
1,Lasted 3-4 months,"I purchased this dryer because of the shape and attachments and wanted to try an ionic dryer. First of all, if this is an ionic dryer I was better off with my super cheap dryer. Second, the back seam of the dryer melted!! Several people have mentioned that it overheats and they are not lying. It shuts off and refuses to come back on. Which is good because then it might melt completely. Don't waste your money on this."
1,Terrible;went south after 10 uses;gutless when working properly,"Purchase of this cheap, terrible product ticked me off so much I'm writing a product review for the very first time. 1) Gutless: no power. Drying my short hair took FOREVER even on highest setting...when it was working. 2) After about the tenth use, the dryer shifted into low and started to make this awful screeching sound. Dogs from miles around were knocking on my door begging me to stop. Seriously, it was painful. 3) When I pulled the Vidal Sassoon VS783 out of the box initially and tried attaching the comb attachment, it slid around and fell off. The brush attachment got stuck on the dryer. I wrestled with it for 5 minutes to remove. All I wanted was a hair dryer that dried my hair quickly. Do yourself a favor and run the other direction from this disappointing product."
5,African woman with thick coarse natural hair.,"im an African woman. i have thick coarse hair as most black people do. i love this hair dryer. gets my hair pretty straight. hot and heavy heat is the trick. this has 1875 watts. lots of heat. so that gets my hair straight. i still need to use a flat iron to curl it if i want it curled, or put rollers in it."
1,Attachment might fall apart,"The hair dryer is good, But if you're like & me want to use the attachments, you should know that the bristle/brush attachment is very low quality. After one use, half of the bristles fell out. When I tried to get a replacement, the company told me that the attachments are not covered under warrenty and that I would have to buy a new one. Like im gonna buy another one and watch the same thing happen again?! Yeah right! I feel really ripped off cause that was the main reason I bought the hair dryer. So if you buy it, just know that that attachment will be useless.Update: The company offered to send me a complimentary replacement! Isnt that nice? I will make another update if anything changes. It wont let me change the star."
2,Not for my hair,"Like many hair dryers before it, this one's blower is too powerful for my thin, very fine hair; the hair blows every which way and I can't control it to style it. Yes, I tried the ""low"" setting, and I looked forward to the shot of cold to finish the style, but no such luck. For others with more normal hair it might be fine, but for me it just doesn't work."
5,Just what I needed,"This is just what I needed, I'm deployed to a remote location and this package came less than 2 weeks. Works great!"
1,WRONG COMB ATTACHMENTS!,"The andis 85010 attachments ARE NOT the for the Vidal Sassoon VS783. I ordered them from amazon in Sept, 2011 to find that they are a little longer than the VS attachments. And they are not curved at the part that slides onto the dryer. My andis package is still unopened, because it was obvious that they won't fit. I'm still trying to get these returned. I'm surprised that amazon still has them listed with this dryer. I called the number another reviewer listed (18004877273) and the rep (Helen of Troy, located in Texas) said they are the only place you can get the VS783 attachments. Today I ordered a wide tooth and fine tooth attachment. They are $4 each and the shipping is $2. Another review was correct about the combs breaking easily. I love the dryer, but I've never seen combs break so easily. Again, DO NOT ORDER the andis 85010 attachments for your VS783 ionic dryer. It is the wrong item."
3,Doesn't blow very warm,"The hair dryer doesn't really dry your hair because it blows too cool. There isn't any adjustment dial to increase the heat. There is a botton to press to make it even coolerThe air is too cool on your head especially in the winter after you get out of a hot shower. The design is very nice and the attachment are nice as well. wouldn't purchase again, I will most likely give it away at some point. Thank you."
2,Short lived! Twice,I have owned two of these. When the first one's switch gave out after about two years use I bought another because I liked the dryer. The second one's switch has quit working after a years use.
1,WILL NEVER BUY AGAIN,This model hair dryer is not 'GOOD' in my opinion. It is very heavy and large when it comes to holding it. My hands are very sore from holding it by the time my hair is dry. And I don't have long heavy hair. The 'ION' option doesn't seem to work either(My hair is never shiny like it used to be. Very fluffy and fly-away.It also shuts itself off very often when drying my hair-I assume it starts to overheat(reason for shutting off). Would not recommend-so VERY DISAPPOINTED
1,worst ever,"Terrible...don't order. Dryer overheats almost immediately. Design of switch is such that you often accidently shut if off during drying. It's heavy and uncomfortable to hold. Didn't keep the paperwork so I am stuck with it. As soon as I get a different one, I'll dump this one."
3,"interesting, ultimately bleak history of a New Mex. commune","the author and her husband, along with 2 childrenhelped start a commune in New Mexico in the early1970's. this new edition of her book, written shortly after the commune's demise in 1975, maps out the problems she had there, starting at day one. Alas, the book never really answers the questions it claims to explore, and the final fate of her and her family was unsatisfying. Above average writing, and some probing insights, but ultimately a bleak history lacking in much revelation."
2,Didn't work for me,"I just wasn't that into this book unfortunately. I adore stories from the 60s and 70s, having been a kid then...but this one just didn't catch or keep my attention. I gave it to a friend and hopefully they will enjoy it more than I did."
2,What have we here?,"I'm no armor expert but I do have a fair knowledge of the subject and a full bookcase of reference books to prove it. This book is a real lightweight. No meat and nearly no potatoes. Not recommended except to persons who want a quick reference and have a limited amount of money to spend. You get what you pay for, 48 pages, 9.6"" by 6.9"" to cover development and operations of these vehicles over the 6 year period of WW2. Anyone want to buy my lightly read copy?"
5,"""Awesome!!!""","This CD is a smash hit, from beginning to end! Every song and interlude has a connective flow that will truly bless the listener. I'm going to get another copy for a friend!"
5,Reliable Inexpensive Laser Printer,"We purchased 3 of these printers and they have fit the bill for us perfectly. They are quick and reliable (althouth they take a minute to warm up for that first print of the day). The print quality is as good any, and the price is right. I would buy again."
5,an earthbound voice speaks,"This is the poet Red hawk's fourth book. Running through all of Red Hawk's work is a common theme, a vision, a continuity seasoned by the poet's spiritual practice and his love of the earth. Red Hawk's voice is one that should be heard in these times of anomie and environmental decay."
4,Lucy Plate,"I liked this and thought it was cute when I ordered it. It actually arrived the next day! (I didn't get espensive shipping so that was quite a surprise). The one problem was that it arrived bent, I assume from the mail. THat was dissapointing."
4,Gift for a Friend,Bought this same plate for a friend of mine who is a huge lucy fan. I wasnt sure at 1st if she would think it was lame or not. Turned out she loved it and sat it in the back window of her car right after getting it. 3 1/2yrs later its so faded from the sunlight on it that I`m picking her up another as a replacement.
1,Do not buy this software,"This software has audio problem. I installed this software on my 2 home PCs (I am a Network Engineer for a Fortune 100 company). There is no audio during Listening Comprehension section. I left a voice mail and email to ETS, and they agreed that there is a problem and they are working on it as of 09/01/2000. Do not buy this."
1,DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING THIS!!,"If you do, you will be left high and dry without anything to prepare for the test with. There is no audio for the Listening Comprehension section. You can get better products in the market for the same money. If I could, I wouldn't even give it a star."
4,Fresh interpretations of Paul Simon's music.,"The New York Voices have blended their vocal style with the timeless music of Paul Simon. This is not a note for note copy of the original Paul Simon or Simon and Garfunkel tunes, but a jazzy updating of them. I especially like the Voices' latin reworking of ""Me And Julio Down By The Schoolyard,"" the lush ""So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright,"" and the humor of ""Why Don't You Write Me?"" All in all, a worthwhile purchase for people who appreciate the magic of the voice as a musical instrument."
5,New York Voices Sing The Songs of Paul Simon,This is a must have vocal jazz cd. The New York Voices choose some of Paul Simon's most outstanding songs and put a new twist on them. The cd is absolutely fabulous and I would recomend it for any fan of vocal jazz!
4,cool,"I have given this album 4 stars because I really prefer their more jazzy, big band type arrangements. Back in the 80's they did some really abstract stuff...which is what I like. I didn't really know alot of Paul Simons songs but when I saw the cd I just had to buy it because of who they are. However I have come to like and appreciate what they did on this particular album. My favorite songs are 'So Long' and 'Old Friends'."
4,Not bad...,"I like the LED's, and it works well. Only issues: you have to put the phone on the charger backwards, so it's hard to read the caller ID when it's on the charger, and it's a little hard to push the phone on to."
4,Great for us lazy chefs...,"I'm not a big fan of spending time in the kitchen, so I love the way I can just plug my George Foreman grill in, throw some food on it, and be done in a few minutes. It's also a lot healthier than microwave cooking; just watch the fat drop into the plastic drip pan. Finally, since it cooks top and bottom, there's no need to turn over your food. Great for burgers, chicken, steaks, ham, quesadillas, etc.I only wish it was dishwasher safe!"
2,Cover breaks easily.,"This grill works well, but if you leave it on too long the heat cracks the metal fittings and melts some of the plastic. I lifted the cover so I could clean the grill and it seperated from the grill. I had the plastic top with wires haning in my hand and the grill still closed on the counter. What can I say, you get what you pay for. I threw away my reciept never expecting it to disintigrate like this, so I couldn't return it.When it's in tact it works great. Makes great panninis and grilled cheese sandwiches. But it could have burned me if I had picked it up differently.Use with caution.P.S.Another review also mentioned this about the lid. I wish I had read these reviews before I bought."
2,Good while it lasted,Worked great for grilling fish and meat - not so good for chicken. Died soon after the 1 year warranty expired.
2,Short Lived Product,"I started off with this model and the Atkins diet, and loved it for its ease of use and the tilt design. Clean up is definitely not easy after the first 2 or 3 uses, but one trick that works is to unplug the unit and shortly after, wet a paper towel, close it up in the unit and allow it to steam (it will not burn). The steam allows almost anything to wipe away easily. Unfortunately, after each use, we noticed more and more teflon chipping away. I insisted my family was abusing it and finally had to get rid of it because there was so little teflon left making sticking during cooking and cleaning a nightmare. My son purchased a new fancier model for me for Christmas and NO ONE used it but me. Once again, the teflon is beginning to chip away. I'm looking into a real indoor grill now, perhaps Delonghi, and not an imitation."
2,Smaller/Steam,"The grill was smaller than I thought it would be. There isn't a ""off/on"" switch and when you lift it top up you get burned by steam."
2,Died after 2 months of use,"It could be because it's almost impossible to clean this without the risk of getting water into the mechanism, maybe that's what happened. Two short months after getting it, it sits dead on the counter after failing to come on tonight. Truth is, I also found that it toughened up the surface of pork chops cooked in it--you can't cut back on the cooking time because it's pork, so you end up with a leathery surface that has to be peeled off because it is inedible. But mostly you can't clean these things! Hamilton Beach makes grills with removable parts for safe and easy cleaning--why bother with trying to clean this without getting water on the bottom?"
2,Good while it lasted,The grill worked fine for about a year. It was great for grilling fish and meat. It died soon after the one year warranty expired.
3,Teddy R. Elliott,"I have a George Forman grill for one year and now, I can not live with out it, you can cook so fast and clean, I live in a R.V. Trailer, You do not have a lot of room to keep large things, but With My grill, it is the size of a plate, so there is no storage space problem, also it is so easy to use, and a lot cooler when you do not have to use the cook stove in the trailer.and no bottle gas. Or gas that runs out in the middle of cooking. Thank you George Forman. thanks for a grill thats gets the fat out.I have heart Problems ,the grill Gets the fat out but leaves the good taste behind, Once again Thank you for the best grill in the world. Teddy Rosevelt Elliott Jr, Smith River CA."
2,Not what I expected.,"The tiny pen tip does not work on my Droid 3. The fat eraser end does, but it's no better than a finger really. I'm disappointed because I specifically picked this stylus because I wanted a small nib for 'draw something.'"
5,"wonderfully romantic, yet heart wrenching",a wonderful journey to answer so many very important unanswered questions of a past. Unique and mesmerising as this young man completes this love story for his father and himself.
5,A future BLUES LEGEND !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I believe Anyhony Gomes will one day be viewed in retrospect as one of the Blues Greats,As we now do for such such greats as Buddy Guy,B.B.King,Howlin Wolf,Robert Johnson & so many others to numerous to mention."
5,Incredible!!!,"Totally an amazing dvd. Unbelievable performance. Totally worth it. Buy it, buy it, buy it!!"
1,Disappointed,"This was an interesting show, but it never should have been called Riverdance. It bears no resemblance whatsoever to the real Riverdance. I was terribly disappointed."
3,Gift for my son with Autism.,"My son loves to watch music videos, and I thought he might enjoy the music and dance on this video. At this point it is too early to tell if it will become one of his favorites.I will note that the service with Amazon.com is always superb and I have never had a complaint.Thanks."
4,You can't help but like this even though it strays a bit from the subject,"We liked it but accepted it only because we couldn't get MF in the original Riverdance. I thought the Flamenco dancer and some of the other singers were a distraction from the ""Celtic"" theme. I could have done without them, not to say that they were bad performers, but just didn't fit into the overall concept."
5,Riverdance,"I have loved the program since I first saw it on a PBS station here in the DC area. While this is not the same program as that one was, it still was very good and the addition of the tap dance face-off added to the show. It does have a few problems but they are minor and can be ignored with no problem.If you life Riverdance this is a good disc to get."
4,Amazing and very inspirational,"Whether you believe in extraterrestrials or not, this is a great philosophy by which to lead and live one's life. Unfortunately, as is often the case with anything that clashes with the accepted ""norm,"" Ms. Larkins' book will be met with ridicule and accusations of fraud. Fortunately, she has the will and courage to perservere. A great read."
1,Invitation to Demonic Possession,"This book would be better suited with the title ""How to open yourself to the Demonic realm in 11 easy steps"". All of the methods Larkin speaks of in this book can be found throughout history as having been used by spirit mediums when contacting ""The other side"". The ""Aliens"" of our modern age have replaced the ""Spirits"" of our past. Same Demonic realm, different name. Stay away from garbage like this, it will only do you harm."
5,Excellent gift for a 2 year old!,I got this on sale from Step2 for my 2 year old as a Christmas gift. She loves the set and has been playing for 2 hours arranging and rearranging all the pieces. She loves arranging the pieces and it is so easy and at the same time sturdy for a 2 year old to handle. I am so pleased with the purchase!
5,OVERLOOKED VINTAGE CCM!,"This archival slice of late-80s CCM holds up well, especially if you like early U-2, The Alarm, etc. Urgent, angry, powerful, and emotionally satisfying. This and Russ Taff's self-titled (second) solo album were spiritual mainstays during a rough period. Both are uncompromising, yet neither is cynical. Was excited to discover Dave released a new (2010) CD covering the blues--check out the reviews."
3,I like it but...,"It can be repetitive! I can't beleive I'm saying this... the songs are a little too long for me. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of the Dead's long musical improvisations... but the songs here are too repetitive to be as long as they are. On the other hand, the lyrics are fantastic and the musicians have skills. If they cut the length of the songs in half and threw some live tracks at the end of this disc, it would be perfect."
4,At Long Last,"For those, myself included, who have anticipated the release of a Ratdog CD, I find myself with mixed emotions. As with most side projects, it is better to experience it yourself live and in person, but this will do nicely until the next time Ratdog rolls into town. Weir's vocals are not as strong as one might hope, but then again, the groove invades your brain and makes you forget all about it. Pick it up and you won't be sorry."
1,This single is a rip-off!,"At this point, with this cd single being available used for ultra low prices, you will pretty likely get a deal. The point however, is that this is supposed to be a maxi single MAXI being the defining word here but the mixes are all radio edits. That is crap! I am supposed to be paying MAXI money for a maxi single and I am getting MINI music for my MAXI money. NO!!!! Why is it that we cd single buyers are not worthy of having the full mixes like those who bought this on vinyl?"
3,A definite lifeguard training text!,"As a lifeguard training instructor with the American Red Cross, I would recommend this book! A key chapter is chapter 2 which mentions the American with Disabilities Act or ADA and how a lifeguard should interact with the public. Rescue skills are no good if you don't have good people skills! I like the idea of additional modules with chapters 13 and 14 lifeguarding at waterpark and waterfront facilities. SO if you take the additional modules you already have the book!!"
4,The ALMOST Definative Ligfeguard Training Text,"As an American Red Cross Lifeguard Training Instructor I have had the opertunity to teach many classes using the above text. Very detailed descriptions and photographs of skills. My only complaint about this text is that you still need a seperate book for the CPR portion of the course. The r2001 release of te program has the CPR in the same book. Even while teaching to the new program, Lifeguarding Today remains one of my most used books for information and examples."
5,Easy to read and understand,This is an outstanding resource book for the novice or the scholar. It is well written and very easy to understand. Arnold covers the Old Tesatment thoroughly. You will not be disappointed.
4,personal library,"a part of building references so I do not have travel to public/private libraries, can use travel time studying/writing"
3,"""The Ocean""","With all due respect for the previous poster's opinion, I'd like to point out that ""The Ocean"" (my story in THE DARKER SIDE) is not a vampire story - it's meant to be a modern-day retelling of the tale of Orpheus and the Maenads. Obscure? Perhaps. Vampiric? Maybe, but if you've read your mythology, you'll know there is a great deal more to them.It wouldn't be appropriate for me to review the book, and I couldn't do so anyway since I haven't received my contributor's copy - hence the noncommittal three stars."
3,Not Quite a Walk on the Darkside,"Some of the stories in this anthology are truly terrifying, such as ""The Plague Species"" and ""Asian Gothic,"" while others are not as scary but truly wonderful stories, such as ""Unspeakable"" and ""Hell Came Down."" The stories seemed to get better as the book wore on, but there were so much mediocrity that I was disappointed. John Pelan's story was sub-par, relating a tale through mostly narration not my cup of tea for horror stories), and the first couple of stories should not have been included in the supposed ""best of the best."" If you're looking for a scary read, pick up the next book in this series, ""A Walk on the Darkside,"" which has much better picks for horrifying horror."
1,Give this one a pass.,"Amazon seems to have eaten my previous review, so here we go again:I am a big fan of horror anthologies and can usually find a few stories that I enjoy but not here. The stories are an uneven mix and mostly sub-par with no real scares or originality.Those looking for something a little more ""on the dark side"" are encouraged to look to the ""Borderlands"" series."
2,not siding with pelan,"there was some amaxing writing style in this. some good descriptions too, though they never seem to fit. describe the horror, not the street! some descriptions were strange and really unfitting. some plots were well enough. but in the end, it just didn't cut it. the endings were terrible, the suspence died out, etc."
3,"Cute, stylish and comfy but not that well made","I have a pair of these flats. I love the way they look and feel but they are not well made, they wear out too fast on the botton part of the pointy part and my feet sweat in these shoes and I live in SF and its not hot or humid year so its not the weather or my feet because I don't have this problem with all my shoes."
4,Very Very Good Machine,"I've read other reviews about this Singer Machine and totally disagree with the bad reviews. This is my first machine and I will say if you don't know much about the machine then is difficult.The machine sews very well, and the automatic needle thread is excellent. It's fast and it saves you time. My sister who has being sewing for years likes this machine very much.I truly believed these bad reviews are from user error."
3,Great for a Beginner,"I bought this machine about two years ago because it was cute and in my price range. After two years of regular to heavy use, the machine stopped working. Apparently the timing mechanism went out, which I was told would happen again. At $80 for a repair, I decided it wasn't worth it, and bought a better machine instead.Even though the machine stopped working, I still loved it. It looked nice sitting on my table, and was pretty intuitive and easy to use. The threading was simple, although the automatic threader isn't too helpful. The knobs are all easy to access, and the built in storage is great. The thread cutter can be hard to find, and doesn't cut too well, though.I would recommend this machine to anyone who is just starting out with light to moderate sewing projects. It wasn't until I started working on the machine fairly regularly that it stopped working. If you're looking for an attractive machine for mending and small projects, I definitely recommend this one."
5,love my new singer!,"i must admit, i have not used a sewing machine since 8th grade. my sweet boyfriend bought me this singer 6038 for my 29th birthday yesterday and i already love it! i just made a cute bag/purse that i finished in no time. i look forward to using this machine quite often."
1,Very Disappointed,"Well, in the beginning it must have been ""dumb luck"", because, after a few successful hemming tries, I recently tried simple repair to seams, straight stitching, and the bobbin is jamming up the works. I cannot seem to adjust the bobbin tension to the slight change in fabric and the insturctions are no help. After hours and hours of trial and error, I have given up. My 30 year old singer sewed rings around this one for ease of use. I caution you, prepare to spend a lot of time learning how to adjust this machine's numerous dials from one project to another. -- And the instructions and video are no help for simple sewing --"
1,This is not the Singer Company I remember.,"This machine was broken when received and I can see why. They make the parts out of plastic! How easily they break apparently. If you want a cheaply made machine, buy this one. I sent mine back."
2,Great paper weight,"I bought this sewing machine for my wife. Please understand this review is based solely on the expletives that spewed from my wife's mouth while sewing with this machine. Apparently bunching up, inadequate speed and difficulty threading the needle were some issues. I just remember my wife always using the stitch ripper to undo a tangled mess. However, the Singer Machine did one positive thing! It made me look like a super hero when I surprised my wife with a Pfaff Expressions 3.0. She dropped kicked the Singer and has never looked back! Seriously, if you are a novice sewer, try to save up for an intermediate machine. I realize it isn't fair to compare the Pfaff {a $1700 machine} with the Singer."
1,Arrived Broken,"My Mother-in-law purchased this machine for Christmas and it arrived from Amazon broken. I returned the machine, obviously if it can't handle shipping it isn't worth the money. Amaxon was GREAT about taking it back."
3,SINGER 6038 46 STITCH FUNCTION SEWING MACHINE,The automatic needle theader did not work. I have to thread needle by hand. I'm using the machine anyway.
1,Good machine until it broke,"I needed a very basic machine. This one had everything I needed and more, and at a very affordable price. It worked great on my first 2 (simple) projects, but when I tried to use it a third time, it broke. Then motor just stopped running. I have to pay to ship it to a warranty center, where the parts are covered but labor is not."
1,50/50 Chance,"After reading all of the comments- there are good and bad comments about this sewing machine. Myself, I've had a bad experience with it. My needle threader was bent and I couldn't line it up- it took me longer to thread the machine than to do it manually. Secondly, the motor was making a weird noise and was not moving fast at all. The machine is heavy so it is hard to transport. I would not recommend it since it wasted my time..."
1,Only worth a $1,Nice at first but maybe a month later just looks like a white ball not a baseball!red wears off and hard to tryto put the seams back on. Not worht the money
5,It ain't bragging if you can do it.,"Hot stuff. And this is really just a jam session so it sounds like Frank & Co are in your living room. As usual, FG is playing ""can you top this"" much of the time and after 50,000 or so arpeggios it can get a bit fatiguing.But the simple fact is, he can do it! Not just play fast, but play over any chord, any progression. Live. On the spot. Blues--of course, but also Coltrane. And it is...effortless! FG doesn't think ""Hmmm...what can I play over that progression..."" He knows. I'm making it sound so mechanical but its really spontaneous.Except for Scott Henderson, Allan Holdsworth and (maybe) Robben Ford I can't think of anyone who can play rock & blues well AND play jazz and fusion on this level. Prepare to be impressed."
1,Disappointed,"Being a long time fan of Ronnie Montrose I was anxious to hear something new, although this CD has been out for several years. I have listened to this CD exactly 2 times and have found nothing to make me want to listen to it again. This is strictly a personal opinion and I'm sure there are listeners out there who enjoy this. Just not what I expected from such a talented guitarist. And further, Ronnie only plays on 2 or 3 tracks. If the tracks hadn't been identified I would have never known."
1,Not next time....,Half of the product came with mold growing on it. The other half tasted so artifical that we just threw it out.
3,This is one of those movies that is so bad... it is good!.,"This is one of those movies that is so bad... it is good!. Well, maybe because you grow close to it because of all the wasted acting talent that did not produce a good flick.All the ingredients seem to be there, an excellent repartee of actors (both young and old), a good solid history line, and historical perspective that the audience can relate too. But in the end it fails to deliver miserably in the execution.In trying to make a comedy a musical and then a movie with some political commentary on it, the director comes up with a mishmash of funny one liners, a few good songs and a twisted plot that leads nowhere as the trackless desert Sahara of old.But for those of you who might try to rescue a few laughs out of this movie here is a brief plot guide with a summary for each of the acts to follow in case you want just to jump to each of the sections for the laugh only.Plot guide at: [...]"
5,Great for thoroughly removing everything!,I had been using another brand that I can no longer get. I tried these through the subscribe and save program. The pad is amazing! I was able to take off all dirt and makeup as well as cleanse my skin. I have sensitive skin but this does not irritate it. I rinsed the pad and wiped off the residue and I was still removing makeup and dirt. Too bad there are only 28 instead of 30 to cover a whole month.
5,Love these,Love these. They clean my face gently or with the exfoliating side and remove makeup verry well. Thought about giving 4 stars bc they should sell replacement packs of the pads instead of having to buy the big plastic tub of them so often. But the pads rock
3,Good for occasional use,"Although Aveeno is supposed to be great for sensitive skin, I sometimes find it a little harsh. These pads are good for a twice per week exfoliation, but if you use it two days in a row, you'll feel some itching and tingling. I do like that each side has a different texture."
5,"My favorite face product, I love having the option to subscribe","I love this, my face loves it and I love it too. This is my only beauty secret along with a good diet and plenty of water."
3,my face is clean...,"That's it. No change, after 3weeks, in brown spots or wrinkles on my face. I'm 42, and trying to undo some damage. I didn't expect miracles, but I expected to see an improvement. There has been none...my face feels clean and soft...great...I can get that with other products that may actually do what they claim. This was a waste of money I couldn't afford to waste. I have acne scars and brown splotches under my eyes. I had hoped this product, along with the other positively ageless cleanser I bought to alternate it with, would help. It didn't. Im glad it's worked so well for everyone else. Once I'm out, I'm switching to something else."
5,Love,Love these! Always gets my face very clean without drying it out. Great price and excellent product. I never use anything else.
5,Great product and best price!,"Love these. There is plenty of cleanser on the pads to be able to remove a face-full of makeup, even while rinsing the pad a bit in the process. I personally can not use the scrubbing side of the pad because it is too harsh for my skin and causes breakouts."
5,Aveeno Positively Radiant Pads are Positively the best,"This product exceeds any other of this type that I have used for facial cleaning including creams, bar soaps, pads, cloths, etc. These pads are packaged well and maintain their moisture and cleansing elements with a high degree of effectiveness. The cleanser is gentle and thorough. I travel with them and use them at home and cannot say enough good things about them."
5,Skin Looks Younger,"This product is great! The Positively Radiant Aveeno products are all great. This one is better than great. The cleanser does a great job of removing oil, left over make up, and all without drying my skin. The pads have an exfoliating side that is wonderful - I'm over 50 but I'm told I have the skin of a much younger woman and I believe gentle, daily exfoliation is why. The other side is so soft, perfect for the delicate area around the eyes. There is plenty of product so that each pad does face and neck. I've used this product for years and will never use anything else for washing my face. Why change when this is ideal??"
5,love them,My daughter uses these and told me to try them. They seem to be a bit more reasonably priced @ Wal-Mart. These are wonderful. They make my skin feel smooth and healthy. I tend to use the pads more than once to save on money. I highly recommend.
1,Just Between the Two of us,"Love Bonnie Owens and Merle Haggard, however, the CD isdefective and I need to return it.The Outlaws CD is great.Thanks for the inquiry."
2,Just Between the Two of Us by Merle Haggard & Bonnie Owens.,You can not find any better singers doing the fine job of singing together than Merle Haggard and the late great Bonnie Owens. I truly enjoy listening to this cd by them both and I think others will too.
4,Nice warm (not hot) dish,"This dish is well made and wonderful in that you can use it in the oven, under the broiler, or over the stove top. It does not, however, keep the food very warm. The outside of the pan is warm to the touch when set over the candles, but the food is lukewarm. Works well if your buffet dish comes right out of the oven to the line and is served immediately. Does not work well for keeping food warm for more than 30 minutes."
2,Looks good but uses small candles.,This buffet server uses small candles to keep food warm. I thought it used burners. I had to return the product as the candle holder was broken.
2,Cuisinart warming trays,"While the size of the container and the lid are great, the warming system using a tiny candle that lasts maybe 20-30 min and does not really warm is horrible!!! The unit should come with a sterno heating element!"
1,if you buy this...,"you're stupid. If you want to learn more about opera, I suggest lectures by Robert Greenberg sold by the Teaching Company, or Opera 101 by Plotkin. This is just a total waste of money."
1,Don't waste your money,This is the worst purchase I have ever made. It is a truly dreadful piece of work.I was so disgusted with it that I threw it into the trash can.
3,Don't make it something it's not...,"No, this is not the only Opera CD you'll ever need. If you're new to opera, you could listen to snippets of songs and then you could feel that you had heard opera without getting dressed, paying for tickets, etc. The CD you want, for listening to entire songs, is ""Opera Greatest Hits."" On that CD, are 18 well-known arias in their entirety, sung by well-known opera singers. This one, however, is OK for playing ""Name That Opera Tune."" You need to be pretty well-versed in opera to use it for this, though; it could make a good game at an opera society or other opera lovers' club. Probably the best thing I got out of this CD is the quarter that my local record shop gave me when I sold it to them."
1,CRAP!!!...AVOID IT LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!!,"Looking for a CD that will introduce you to Opera?..You WON'T find it here! What you get are 20 or so ""snippets"", or a taste of what an Opera tune would sound like! If you're into playing ""Name That Tune"" with Opera Arias, this is your baby! Other than that...this is a complete waste of your time & money! Go to your local library instead, and check out a COMPLETE Opera--- for FREE!!! I tossed this into the discount bin at the local Flea Market, and smart shoppers have avoided it like the plague!...so should you!!! The only value it MAY have, is if you bury it on your CD shelf, and TRY to impress the chicks into thinking you have an interest in Opera!"
3,A fun way to hear 100 great snatches of song for $4,"At $3.98 for 100 musical ""moments"" on one CD, you know it's going to be brief snatches of tunes and singing - hello?But there is much fabulous singing and music reprised here, put this on and wait for something to make you jump up and find out: ""what's THAT!""Like the Pearlfisher's duet with Bjorling& Merrill, in case you hadn't heard that version before.Or Eleanor Steber's Sempre libera.what fun! Make a quiz out of it with friends: whazzat?You may need to run out and get the whole item (the raison d'etre of the whole exercise, clearly)."
1,The Only Opera CD You'll Never Want!!!,"At 19 cents, this is a rip off. Why, O, Why would any one in their right mind do this. I hope it was meant as a very poor joke, because that's what it is."
1,Sad....,"Sad.... Something of a waste of time (the listeners' that is). The CD requires a link to the Internet; this alone disqualifies it as anything that could be useful for even the tyro Opera listener. The selections afforded the listener are too brief, and the included ""bio's"" of Opera Singers/Composers are not extensive enough to have value. I rated this CD at 1 star simply because a zero or negative value was not available. The idea behind this CD was excellent, the execution was not."
1,I should have known...,"with 100+ track listings that these were not complete samples. Somehow I didn't notice this until AFTER I bought it. This CD gives you NO idea of how these pieces sound, it's better suited for a game of opera Name That Tune. Please, don't waste your money."
3,misleading,"this cd is not what its cracked up to be. The songs play for only 30 seconds (or less), leaving the listener wanting more.However, if the cd is played on the computer, not only is the music heard, but the viewer can read about the performer. On some (not all) of the selections, there is a synopsis of the opera being listened to.in short, a great cd for a opera novice, a disapointment for an opera buff."
1,Zero stars -- the absolute worst,"Do not buy this. It's THE WORST intro to the opera, as the cover image can attest to. TINY snippets are amassed here. AMAZINGLY, they even included Adele's Laughing Song from ""The Bat"" by... Florence Foster Jenkins! The purpose of this release seems to be to lure people away from the opera.Absolutely distasteful!"
1,This sucks...,"I should only blame myself for not checking out more reviews... this is a CD filled with short, little snippets of great operas songs... and I mean SHORT, LITTLE snippets of 30 seconds or so, each. Don't buy this CD... it is a complete rip off... and that is saying ALOT since it is only $4.00... Again, my fault for not reading the reviews but I trusted that something called a ""Music CD"" would actually have complete songs... What else does this company offer? A ""Music CD"" that only has the intros or applause tracks to great songs...?Move on to something else... Amazon has a great selection... just not this one."
3,I need more power!,"This card works OK,it occasionally causes my Dell Inspiron 7000 to hang until I pull the card out.It needs a power cord though because if you hook an iPod up to it and doo a full erase and reload and don't come back to your PC for an hour or so it drains the battery on the Ipod. If it was a powered card this probably would not happen."
2,Mostly Military,"Nash-Marshall offers a quickly read, introductory book on Joan of Arc in the same history-and-meditation format at Mary Gordon's for Penguin. Most of the meditation is in the last two chapters, some of it a bit weird. The author believes that the source of Joan's power must have been God, because if Joan had been the source of her own power she would have found a way to escape from prison in Rouen. Nash-Marshall's Joan is a ""doer"" and an ""energetic warrior,"" in seeming disagreement with the Chapu marble Joan in repose on the book jacket (see p. 168). Typos (""Crepy"" for the big battle at ""Crecy"") and curious sentences like the one in which Joan convinced soldiers to ""live without the female attachments to which medieval armies were assuaged"" suggest some of the difficulties with this book."
3,Animaux caricaturaux surtout,"Un bon livre pour tout ceux qui sont interresse par le ""cartooning"" et la caricature. Hultgren, un ancien animateur de chez Disney, nous montre d'abord le dessin realiste, puis sa version caricaturale ou stylise.L'essentiel des animaux y est represente (de beaux dessins de chevaux mais un peu sombres a mon gout) mais l'emphase du livre est surtout l'action, le rythme des lignes, la dynamique du mouvement dans les poses.Un bon livre pour les debutants qui offre plusieurs petits trucs tres pertinents. Procurez-vous aussi ""Comment dessiner des animaux"" par Jack Hamm sur Amazon.com. Un excellent bouquin!"
4,Much better than the manual,If you use Application Center buy this book. Far better than what passes for a manual from Microsoft and even better than the Microsoft class.
5,Refreshingly non-religious,This book is a jewel and it's definitely not written for the staunchly legalistic religious set. I was comfortable with his down-to-earth approach.I found it to be written for the average person seeking more of an understanding about God and Raymond Ho gently teaches how to walk down that path. What is refreshing to me is that I didn't find a bunch of organized religion in this book.He makes hearings God's voice understandable and accessible to anyone who really wants to hear from God. I would recommend this book to anyone with a hunger for more Spirituality and an aversion to organized religion
1,Awful!,"Plugged into any device other that iPod: Works for 5-10 minutes then loses the connection with no apparent cause.With iPod: Keeps the connection open, but sound randomly drops for a fraction of a second, several times a minute, if the transmitter is > 6 feet from the base station. (Note: I have no problems with any other BlueTooth item I own within my house) This is VERY obnoxious, and means it the device effectively has just a 6 foot range."
2,could be better,"The product came in defective--when it is connected, it seems to work beautifully--however, I keep getting disconnected intermittently every 10 minutes or so. I caled Scosche and I was directed to my merchant to get a replacement. I am still waiting for a replacement to get mailed to me."
1,Not worth the money,The product looks like manufactured many years ago and not in good condition. The rubber is peeled off the sponge.
2,omg,This is the worst paddle ever!! I was hoping for much better quality from prince!!!!!!! I would rather it should be double sided. I'm returning this item right away
5,Complelling as much as it is refreshing,From the moment i pick Last Man Standig up i couldn't put it down. Not knowing very much about the Geronimo Pratt case when i started the book i was continualy amased at what he was forced to endure. Olsen delivery of this story is phenominal. He does everything right. I recomend this to anyone from any generation. It paints a picture of American history that many don't know about and some want to forget.
5,"Great reading, exciting, moving - a significant work!","Jack Olsen is my favorite contemporary author. While I've enjoyed and been educated by all of Mr. Olsen's true-crime books, this one stands out as a work of international import -- MUST reading for anyone who is self-actualized enough to study imporant writings that help intelligent people to understand what is really going on in the world today and how we got this way. As for the subject, suffice it to say that the true criminals in this book are not who we would expect them to be...Best of all, this book is an excellent read, too -- a book that you won't want to put down.Don't miss it!!!"
3,"Long, but restless","Beltrami's score for The Watcher once again places the composer in a genre he is most famous and unfortunately also pretty much typecast for: the horror/thriller flick. The Watcher with its 60 minutes running time seems a bit long and could have been shortened to a strong 45 minute CD. Beltrami's score echoes some of his music for the Scream trilogy (the solo voice, brass ostinati) and does have some strong moments by using rhythmic electronic effects along with the orchestra. This gives the music a restless and pounding tone. Not at all a bad one!"
4,A modern Thief: The Dark Project score?,"I've only recently (in the past couple years) become increasingly obsessed with movie and game scores, but this one has really stood out. The music is more original than anything I've heard recently and conveys more story than its horrible movie counterpart ever could. It reminds me of what a ""Thief: The Dark Project"" game score would sound like in more modern terms ... it starts sneaky and dark, then hurls into a cascade of intense beats in a slightly gritty, but highly stylized ambience. This pairs well with the Fight Club score which is electronic-based, but slightly ""wacky"" and less flowing. The combination of the two, is a nifty mix that helps fire all sorts of imaginative energies and conjure inspiring images."
2,Can any one help me out?????plzzzzzz,When griff was taking pictures of the girl in the photoshop there was this one song in the background it was a girl singing ummm it was a slow jam can sumone tell me the name of dat song???
2,This ablum is not worth buying,This ablum is not worth buying if you're not in to movies scores. Their was a great song in the middle of this movie that was played that I thought was wonderful. It was a women singing and it appear on the radio in the movie which when she hit the killer on the head with it. Now that was the reason why I brought the ablum. But just my luck it did not appeared on the the soundtrack.I would love to know who is she are what band does she belong to
3,"A Good, Basic Reference","Cruisers of World War Two: An International Encyclopedia is a good reference on the cruisers of all the combatant nations of World War 2. All details are given concerning number of ships in the class, dimensions, weapons, operational history, and final disposition. The selection of photos is good; however as a modeler's reference, it falls short, primarily because the drawings are basic, showing little detail. A word of caution; in my copy of this book, the operational history of HMS Jamaica of the British Fiji class is not included."
5,OVERALL REVIEW OF LOGISTICAL DATA ON SHIPS,"I have set up the purchasing of my library of books into basically two catagories. Firstcategory is basically on logistics/beginnings, and the second on historical info regardingwar involvement, dates, personnel and revealing the fate of said ship or operation.I enjoyed said book and how everything was categorized/rated. Very informative and easyto understand."
1,content not substantial,"With good intentions, the author sets out to play the best golf he can. But the storyline is too much about him -- his pain, mishits, and trials and tribulations. I was hoping for more insight into the process of becoming a pro golfer. Instead, we focus on his pain and drinking to relieve it. The fact there are many misspellings in the book doesn't add to your reading enjoyment. All in all, not what I hoped."
2,Good ending doesn't make up for the rest of the book,"This book started out slowly, got slower & slower, and then finally picked up its pace at the end. You know it's not the greatest book in the world when a golf enthusiast such as I can manage to read a chapter & then set it aside for a week at a time. It does have some charming character development, however, and I thought the stories at the end of the book bumped this book up from an otherwise deserving one-star book."
4,too yellow,"I used this item and it worked flawlessly, I don't mind the yellow but I would have gotten a blue one if one had been available, I don't want to dress like a big fishing lure lol. but the device works well and is made well for the kind of thing it is."
4,Works great,"We purchased these vests before going on a trip to Barbados. We were planning on doing some snorkeling and didn't know if we could rent equipment along the beaches. The vest worked great, it was very colorful so it was easily seen by the jet skiers in the area. Couldnt find a better price anywhere else so this was perfect."
2,Bad Advertising!!,"I bought this item under the impression that it was yellow, from the picture! When I recieved it, it was neon green, so had to mail it back and EAT return shipping!! The vest itself seemed fine, just the wrong color."
4,Worth the read,"I bought this book after hiring a trainer that had a bit of a ""rough"" approach. The author's approach is all about positive reinforcement so it was a great perspective to get. While we are still struggling with our 14 week old Tibetan Terrier, we have used many of the training guidelines outlined in the book. If you too have a puppy, good luck...you will need it!"
3,only average,"I can't seem to find a can that it actually fits well. It's an O.K. product, but not great."
2,Super Fresh not a Super Fit,"This does not create a tight fit on my standard 5.5 oz cat food cans, which means I overspent for a useless device. All I wanted was a tight enough cover to insure the food doesn't get stale in the refrigerator, but instead I bought a high tech carbon producing product that doesn't work well. What a frustrating waste of money, time, and personal energy. Another product for the growing trash heap. ONE STAR, Please."
4,Worth having for for Trio Mocoto collectors.,"Not as wild and ""funky"" as their more recent ""Samba Rock"" and ""Beleza! Beleza!! Beleza!!!"" CD's..... but worth having.The Brasilian record company 'Som Livre' only recently in the last few years reissued this on CD with the original cover art work.Before that, the LP consistently sold for over $100.00 on Ebay."
2,Does not shine as expected,"Although Goddard has a good reputation for silver polish and other items, this one was a disappointment. I would not recommend it, especially for use on antiques."
4,Not my favorite Love Dogs songs but enjoyable,"I do like this CD and listen to it a lot, but prefer ""I'm Yo Dog"" and ""Heavy Petting"". Nonetheless, I recommend ALL of their music. They are fabulous!"
3,"Not grabbing me like ""Heavy Petting"" and I'm Yo Dog""","I LOVE the Love Dogs - great Boston-based dance and Blues Band. If you don't know their music and you are looking for GREAT swing/lindy dance tunes, go for Heavy petting or I'm Yo' Dog - or both!Great band, this one is not my favorite CD."
1,Non-stick finish problem,"I really liked this machine -- for a while. It was easy to set up and break down for transporting. BUT, even with careful cleaning, it (as well as my small kitchen electric unit) has peeling/flaking finish. I think it is unhealthy to eat food which could contain particles of this finish. I can't find my manual to see if it has replacement parts available. But, certainly can't find parts on the web. So, getting in touch with them for service has, thus far, become impossible. So, if you only need it to last for a season or two, it would be fine. But, don't expect it to endure much longer."
4,A poetic treat,"This is a book to savor slowly. Unlike much of modern fiction - written to be read in a flash - this wonderful novel requires the reader's attention to every sensory detail. To read it in a rush is to deprive oneself of what the book is all about - the passing of generations, the anguish of loss, the reaffirmation of life, and - above all - the love of the land. The characters are wonderful, and certain chapters, to counterbalance the undercurrent of loss, are intentionally hilarious. We have all known some of the people who live in Port William, Kentucky - age does not dimish them. This novel is what American fiction should be - but often isn't. A poet wrote it, which is evident in every line. A memorable treat for the patient reader."
4,Very good. Certainly worth the money.,Filled with lots of film footage of carrier landings and take off mishaps. The film footage covers WWII aircraft and Vietnam era aircraft mostly. Anyone interested in Naval aviation will certainly enjoy this video.
3,What?,People will put anything on video. This is some veryunusual material for a DVD. I was curious tosome because of reviews of this DVD.
1,"Unoriginal tracklist , Bad Mix","I just listened this cd..... I did that because maybe it was a good introduction to electronic music, but no this is one of the worst mix i ve ever heard, how many times we have to listen acido da bazz, sandstorm etc? if you want a good introduction to electronic music go for seb fontaine prototype 1,3 or 4 , if you want good electronic music go for any Global Underground (sasha at san francisco, digweed at los angeles, dave seaman at buenos aires etc, but please stay away from ray munns, avoid ray house."
5,WOW! amazing mix!,"Wow, I just got this cd yesterday. It's really cool. The collection of songs is awesome. A few of the songs I've already heard on the radio like Delerium and Dido, but they were remixes that I've never heard before, which is pretty cool. They also put a song I've heard in clubs before, Azzido Da Bass- Dooms Night (timo maas remix), which made me feel the album didn't just have a bunch of radio hits on it. And then there were songs I've never heard before like Tenth Planet- Ghosts, Coast 2 Coast-Home, and Slyder- Score. I will definately have to go buy any other albums these groups are on. Ray's House is a great cd to get for anybody that wants to be introduced into electronic music. Oh, not only are these songs so fun to dance to, they're mixed incredibly well too. They just flow from one song to the next. I couldn't tell when a new song came on until new vocals came up. WOW! get this!"
1,DO IT!,You could sharpen the edges and commit suicide. That's the only useful thing I can think of to do with it.
3,Okay...,"Ray is a euro-asian-american genius. The music is loved by mass audiences around the world. What more could you ask for? There's nothing wrong with commercialism, etc. Some people just don't have time to do all that digging in the crates and what not. I didn't even know who Ray Munns was when I bought this album. I just walked by and was drawn by his hyptnotic stance with arm stretched out with that yearning and desire to have a really cool time."
1,Insta-Ravers Delight,"The fact that someone would actually consider this as a purchase should seriously question why. I label this self proclaimed DJ as the next N-Sync of ""pop-dance music"" (or ""techno"" for all you mindless robots), but that might be giving him too much credit. I find it humorous that someone saw this CD....saw the tracks...saw the cover...and said ""hmmm...being the average American consumer that I am...I'll take this CD."" Enjoy!"
3,Uh...can you say Commercial!,"First of all, it doesn't even look like in the other review the person even listened to the CD. I also have not listened to this CD but judging from the tracklisting and hm...Ray Munns, I'm guessing it blows a big one. All those songs have been used sooooo many times, so unoriginal tracklisting. Now for the mixing, does any trancehead who listens to great DJs such as Sasha+Digweed and Paul van Dyk think Ray Munns...(Ray Munns?)'s mixing is going to be any good at all; I being a trance freak think not. Here's the reason I didn't listen to this album before writing a review: Just by looking at it shows me it is not worth my time.PLZ READ AS WELL.... On another note, this might be an ok CD just if you are getting into trance. If you got the $ and are just getting into trance, I suggest you buy some of the following: Paul van Dyk - Seven ways, Paul van Dyk - Out There And Back, anything by Paul Oakenfold or Sasha+Digweed."
1,"This disc is like these reviews, you've heard it all before.","Every single track on this album, bar two, are old stuff that nobody should really want to listen to now. The only actual ""good"" songs on here are:Delerium feat. Sarah McLachlan - Silence (DJ Tiesto Remix)This one was the biggest trance track of 1999. *1999*! It's good, but it's old...dance music is about the NEW!Slyder - ScoreI first heard of this in Grand Theft Auto 3...and I've been searching for the vinyl everywhere. This is one of those tracks that could easily fit among a bunch of more toned down tracks.A mix full of anthems doesn't work. A mix of 15 or so songs with 2 or 3 anthems works much better. Not to mention the fact that one reviewer mentioned ""WOW! up to 10, even 15 second mixes!"" and that made me laugh. Personally, I mix for 2 or 3 minutes per song... Makes me sick. Go buy some Global Underground."
2,Superficial and simple,"Without trivializing the sufferings of the Rio family, I honestly feel like this book offers no insight to the complexity of anorexia nervosa. Tara's eating disorder - which was not anorexia at all, but bulimorexia - was a relatively short ordeal, and she did not hide it from her family like many sick young women do (or like the excerpt from the back of the book would have the prospective reader believe she did). Introspection is nihil - rarely expressed is sentiment deeper than ""I feel fat"". Moreover, the overall tone is self-centered, as the authors never speculate upon the epidemic nature of the disease; I call this sort of self-congratulatory, non-academic memoir ""victimization literature."" For these reasons and more, I cannot recommend this title as a quality account of an eating disorder."
5,"True story, Real insight. Good Theories.","I thought this mother/daughter story was very accurate and sincere. How wonderful that they kept such a telling record of thier struggles for others to read. Many other reviewers have said that this is too ""easy, boring, and worhtless"", I think those may be the readers who are reading eating disorder books to feed thier own eating issues...like ""Wasted"", which many have called a handbook for how to have an eating disorder. I think this story is not as graphic as some, but it is a true account of a mother and daughter and thier struggles with a deadly disease. Also, the commentary by Dr. Craig Johnson was very interesting to read. He is very well known in this field, and he covers many issues in a very easy-to-understand way in this book.Remember, not all eating disorder books are going to be as graphic as books such as ""Wasted"", but then again, not all eating disorders are that graphic either."
2,"Great, from a mother's point of view...Otherwise, worthless.","This book is the first I have read to hear from the mother's side of an eating disorder. However, it is a bit unrealistic in the world of eating disorders. The daughter developed bulimia, and the mother had enough insight to get her treatment before it was terribly out of control. The whole episode from the ""onset"" to ""recovery"" was less than 2 years. It's great that she is fully recovered, but it is unrealistic in eating disorders that have plagued women for 5, 10, 20 years. Don't expect any enlightenment or answers from this book. Like I said, it is only good to read the mother's viewpoint while this ""eating disorder"" suffered. Look elsewhere for answers on true, long-term eating disorders."
3,Not What I Expected,"I read this book at a bookstore and have already read several other books on eating disorders. This book was disappointing in that it felt that much of it centered on non-ED related issues unlike the title suggests. Although it was great that Tara quickly got over her ED, it seemed that half the book was devoted to other parts of her life (e.g., relations with her mother and boyfriend, college, an assault in Mexico) and I feel that this book didn't provide any useful insight above and beyond other books on the topic (e.g., Stick Figure, Wasted). However, it may be helpful for mothers with a child who has an eating disorder."
1,NOTHING TO DO WITH ANOREXIA FOR MORE THAN HALF OF THE BOOK!!,"I'm a recovering anorexic who assumed this book would help me relate to the mother and daughter in this book. It was non discriptive, including not even telling how low Tara's weight got, her weeks in treatment, and didn't say how much she lost. They never said she got sick looking or anything related. The rest of the book was complete garbage about how she is doing at home and at school. O yeah, her mother is so naive to even pay attention to how her health was going. "" Tara looks kindof blank and sad"", says her mother. WELL DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT IF YOU'RE A PSCHYATRIST AND HELP HER!!! don't waste you're time and money on this book. it's just not worth it."
1,Wheres the flavor??,"I was excited after reading all the reviews, however, reality hit when I used it. First of all, it can only hold 2 burgers, not 3 large ones like it states. It cooked fast, but my burger was completely tastless. I also tried steak with lost its flavor too. The only thing I use it for is bacon, and I don't know for how much longer cause its such a pain to clean!!"
4,"Great for when you can't BBQ, EZ clean-up",Have had mine for 3 years now. It's come in handy and works great.Love the EZ clean-up.
2,Not well made,"I'm giving this 2 stars because it works great for small and quick meals. However, after my third use, the lever to the warming lid broke off. Now it is secured with duct tape. Yucky. After the sixth use, the back of the unit, the white coated metal is now a burnt brown color. Makes me nervous that it gets hot enough to color the body so quickly! As with any appliance, do not leave unattended!"
2,Why bother?,"It lacks enough weight to hold it down when being opened with the recommended ""pot holder."" It slides around on the counter-top putting the little grease catcher in jeopardy of dumping. The bun warmer is ineffective at best and would better be replaced by a decent handle with which to open the grill. Good clean-up is nearly impossible since the heating surfaces are not removable. I like the idea of draining the grease but I've gone back to my Al-Clad cookware after using it three times. I didn't even try to clean it the third time; I tossed it. I'm embarrassed that I fell for the hype."
4,For $40 no complaints but....,"You get what you pay for and for $40 this is about what I expect from a $40 pair of shoes. They are light and comfortable. The sole is a semi-soft sole, good for walking quietly and not for rigorous activity such as ""jumping"" as one reviewer said, though I think if I was planning on ""jumping"" sneakers would come more to mind. The only word of caution I have is, the width size...when they say ""B"" is narrow, I can only imagine. I ordered a 9 ""D"" which I usually wear and these boots are definitely more narrow then a ""D"". They will suffice as they are moccasins and will stretch a little but if you have wide feet..they will be a tight fit."
2,My View on Proview PRO735,"This is an OK monitor with a really nice exterior look to it. It practically works right out of the box and responds well, with no glitches from its front panel controls, or with reboot. It will suffice if your not on the computer much, ~but for serious surfing, and detail work with; graphics, programming, or bookkeeping, its a pain in the eyes. . . and head! Whether its the glare or shimmering glimmer, you'll notice it soon after working with it. Adjusting the adapter settings to optimal doesn't make it any better, and trying to find this monitor on the Proview site, for more info, is a big woop!??My recommendation is: if your upgrading for a better view, this is not what your looking for; but if you just use the computer as a general appliance, with no need to stare at it for long periods of time, then this will do in a pinch."
4,Great Steamer,Great Steamer. The only complaint is that it needs longer hose for steaming draperies. Otherwise would totally recommend this product.
1,Just a quick thought,"I like all kinds of music. This was one of the first things I didn't like, at all. I am in a band that just started, and we're not very well known. But I would rather be in this band and not be known and still be able to play quality music instead of playing music that really should be redone. The effort is shown guys, but it seems like if you're looking to get a record deal, you should probably try not to drown in a puddle of punk/ska that can be mistaken for any garage band acrossed america."
1,I HATE THEM I HATE THEM VERY VERY MUCH,ALL SYNTHEITC ELEMENTS DOES IS GO AROUND TELLING EVERYONE WHAT SCREWED UP LIFES THEY HAVE THEN THEY TELL EVERYONE HOW SCREWED UP THERE LIFES ARE THEN ALL THEY HALF TO DO IS PRAY TO SOME STUPID LITTLE STATUE THEN EVERYTHING WILL BE FORGOTEN THEN THEY CAN LIVE IN A GUILT FREE SOCIETY AND THEN THEY REALIZE WHAT A LAZY CRAPPY (...) BAND THEY REALLY ARE THEN THEY WILL BE ABLE TO TALK TO THERE FANS ON A NORMAL LEVEL
4,Nice,"I am very happy with this comforter set. It is very colorful and I like that it has a variety of vehicles, trains and planes. Because of the colors in the comforter, it was easy to match to other items in the room. It's not the most luxurious in feel, but my little 3 year old doesn't care in the least!"
2,Not Very Soft,"I was kind of disappointed with this product. After a few washes the comforter is just not as soft as another comforter I bought at a department store, and the department store comforter was much cheaper and it came with sheets, pillow case, and fitted sheet. Maybe I paid for the name of the brand."
1,Horrible Company and Horrible Product,"It took two months with no communication from the company to receive my complete order. I made three phone calls and one email that were never returned. When I finally talked to someone, he promised me free shipping and a 10% discount. I never saw it! The quality of material is cheap. The pattern is cute, but there were several sewing errors and blemishes. Basically, I've wasted a lot of money and time in dealing with this company. I discourage anyone from making purchases from Olive Kids. The company is quite incompetent!!"
3,Not as described!,"The description on this quilt states that the shell is 100% cotton. When I received the 2 quilts I ordered, I was very disappointed to see the packaging has it labeled as 60% cotton 40% polyester. I would never have ordered them if I knew they were not all cotton. Now, my sons are both so excited about their new comforters, I feel trapped. They do not feel nice, they are thin as previous reviews state, and feel a lot like cheap hotel comforters. Overall very disappointed."
2,not durable,"I bought this comforter in september, well I just washed it and it is tearing appart...This item is very pretty but it does not stand regular washing...First time and the blue fabric (ridge) unstitched in several plaes and the trains,planes and trucks fabric is sticking out horribly. I expected a quality product, specially for the price."
3,Cant beat trucks n stuff,"The quality seems ok. I didnt realize how thin and light weight it would be. It will be fine for spring/summer but need to add a heavy blanket for fall/winter. However, the print is great for our son and his smile is worth everything."
5,bright colors,"I am certainly pleased with the comforter, it's really well made, the colors are brilliant. It washes very well, as I wash it often. I will definetely purchase other olive kids products and use your site to do so. Thanks from myself and my son"
2,Lacking in quality,"The material has a very synthetic feel to it. Not very soft, and lacking in quality. We returned it and found another product that was cheaper and much better."
2,"Scratchy/Rough sheets, even my son complains","I've made the mistake of buying ""100% soft cotton percale"" (210 thread count says OK site) sheets, including two sets from Olive Kids. My son loved the patterns, but despite my washing them with fabric softener and dryer softener sheets, he still complains ""these sheets are scrtachy and hurt me"". Maybe its the printing. They've been washed about 5 times now and I've taken to using a white jersey pillowcase to protect his face. I hope OK upgrades their thread count, but from now on, I'm NEVER buying percale. My son is three and doesn't normally complain about fabric."
3,Novellas,"I liked some of these novellas more than others. They are: Souls (winner of the 1983 Hugo award), The Mystery of the Young Gentleman, Bodies, What Did You Do During the Revolution, Grandma?, Everyday Depressions."
4,To Bangla or not to Bangla,"The cd for this book has some great conversations to practice.However, the time allowed to repeat is minimal. It would be SO much better if more time were allowed.The book is written, it seems, by a professor using college type language. I had studied Bangla many years ago and was using this as a refresher. If I had been brand new to the language...I would have been lost in the wordage.It has, however, been very helpful to me and I would recommend it to someone who plans to be in the country for awhile."
3,short battery life,"I had this phone for almost 2 yrs now. Everything works, bluetooth, good if you have a headset or car with the option. But the down side is the battery life is very short, 10 -12 hours standby. I replaced the battery already once, but it is the same thing. Also the volume key at the side is very sensitive to touch, so if you put it in your pocket, it get moved around, your volume setting of the ringtone or rington style will change. Several times I missed the call because it changed to vibrate by itself!? The camera works well. Overall a solid phone, but please provide longer battery life."
2,okay at first,"I've read about horrible problems with dropped calls and short battery life, none of which I've had. The outside screen does freeze sometimes with a weird rectangle on it. Also, after a few months, two small cracks appeared on the silver part of the exterior, which have gotten bigger and bigger. Cingular and Motorola refuse to acknowldge that there is something wrong with the phone - they call it user misuse. I keep this phone in my purse all day! It's just not a very sturdy phone. I still have 15 months left on my contract and I doubt it will make it. At which point, it will be out of warranty and I will have to pay $150 for a new one. Needless to say, I am not happy with either Cingular or Motorola."
2,Boo to Motorola,"To start out, this phone looks really cool and takes pretty good pictures for a phone. I'm am now an official Motorola cell phone hater. I have owned two Nokia phones before this and I loved them, then I got caught up in the looks and at this time Nokia had nothing out really. The connection on the phone for the charger sucks and it could easily break or (like I'm experiencing) it doesn't hook up right. The signal is horrible and makes cingular look bad (good thing I've had cingular for years). It took a while to get used to because the buttons arranged differently than the Nokias. The front screen on my boyfriends phone broke. Granted, mine has taken a beating, overall I'm just disappointed. I can't wait until the iPhone comes out!!!!"
2,The metal frame outside gave a crack,"My wife has this phone, the features are good overall. The problem with this phone is that the front silver portion on the phone got a crack. It was not dropped and had been stored always in the purse."
4,Uneven backlight on keypad numbers?,"Just received the V557 and it's charging. Noticed that the backlight on the keypad is uneven. The numbers 4,5,6 are much brighter then the other keys, as is the key under the 8 key, The other keys are backlite but not as bright. Is this normal? Maybe the keys don't have a ""light"" for each key? Will update this review when I start using the phone.UPDATE: Both Motorola and an answer on a phone forum state that each key does not have it's own light. Instead a light under the keyboard is reflected to service all keys. Thus the uneven brightness of key to key is normal. It's not a big deal....."
1,CONTENT,"Once again, I look to buy Big Band Era albums and I come across an album that displays NO CONTENT, no list of songs, zip, nada, niente'.. As a former Creative Director of an ad agency, I ask the primal question, How do you expect to sell an album without listing the songs? I hit a pop-up menu that indicated it would play ""samples,"" however, a second pop-up saddled the list blocking it from view and it said, ""No samples available for this album."" Nor, because of the pop-up block, no content available for the album either."
4,"Great, but I've heard better","Don't get me wrong, this is a good album, but I've heard many albums that are better."
5,"Great CD, the classics can't be beat.","This CD is one of the best in Swing that I have heard. I like it because it is the origenal recordings of the musicians. Yes the CD might not have the same perfect quality of the modern, remastered CDs, but that classic feel is unbeatable. This is the music that my grandparents listened to on Saturday night with an antique radio. This is the music that I want to listen to as well with that same feel."
5,"everybody loves raymond, including me!","i've been watching this sitcom on tv and was instantly hooked. i can sometimes relate to debra, unfortunately! hahaha! but this is an extremely funny show and it's not all about laughs, but about relationships as well. it usually has some kind of moral in the end. all the actors play their roles perfectly. you'll also see how the show developed. the first few episodes were not as funny, it was as if they were still ""building"" their characters, but after the 4th or 5th, they just sunk into the roles like they were playing themselves.there is really no other sitcom like it, i can't think of a single family sitcom that can come close to everybody loves raymond. what can i say? i'm a big fan! it is a really great dvd set for a good price, too! i can't wait for the rest of the seasons to come out. buy it, quick!"
1,I Hate this unfunny show,It's so dumb and lame. I hate this show and I don't see anything good about it.
5,Excellent product and excellent service,Ordered years 1-9 of Hawaii 5-0 and am completely satisfied with the product. The picture and sound are great. Delivery was prompt. I am a satisfied buyer and would recommend this purchase from Amazon.com.
1,terrible,My first toaster didn't work at all! I sent it back to thecompany for a replacement. The second one had a seriouslyflawed finish and toasted only one side of the bread!
4,"Too expensive, but works okay","My unit has worked fine since arrival. It doesn't get heavy use. I would have liked to see a hold button on the automatic loading cycle, and the heating wires could have been constructed and designed better---especially at this price. The finish was perfect and if you like the retro look you should like this. Easy cleaning for the crumb tray also. Like the defrost cycle and extra wide slots."
4,Be Amazed,After reading the book I didn't stop my needlework for days. I highly advise this book for anyone who loves good needlework. You can email me at carl_eisenmann@shi.com if you would like to further discuss this excellent book.
3,Very good,I liked The Essentials DVD better ONLY because this one is much more indepth and the other one got me up and running quickly. The materials in this DVD are awesome but you have to spend more time with this one.
5,Excellent,"If you have taken yoga classes and wish a DVD for home, this is great. As title implies, DVD concentrates on lower body. If you aren't familiar with yoga, you may need to watch the video a few times to feel comfortable with the various positions, but there is nothing too complicated that can't be learned on your own."
1,Did NOT Like At All,"I do not understand the attraction of silicone bakeware. It is very difficult to handle when it's full of batter - you need something to steady it or it flops over. In spite of being extremely careful, the bakeware cuts easily and it didn't last at all. Threw it out and will never get another piece of silicone bakeware."
4,Good for a single,"I'm not big on buying singles, but I bought this one because I love New Order and I'm determined to get everything by them and there was a version of Bizarre Love Triangle that I could not find anywhere else. Well, I found it here. Three beautiful mixes, a cool (for the most part) instrumental, and State of the Nation, a song that I didn't like so much at first but really grew on me after a few listenings. Overall a great buy. I didn't want to give it five stars because I'm not sure it's the absolute best of the best, but I would have easily given it 4 and a half stars if I could have. A must have for all New Order fans or for those who just want to explore one really great song in nearly every way possible."
2,"Useful information, but not what I was looking for","This book is about working as related to the field of information science. It talks about getting your first job, dealing with users, handling difficult situations at work, finding new employment, and possible entrepreneurship ventures. However, this book does not explain different methodologies, techniques to become a better IS professional, common jargon in the industry or insight from experienced professionals. So...although this book gave me very little what I did want to know, perhaps I should have read the summary a little more. The reading is interesting and is written so that you can refer back to it as a reference, but most of the information can be better found through well known books like What Color Is Your Parachute or other non I.S. specialized books."
2,A challenge sutiable for a 5 year old,"This game by far was the easiest game i have ever played. I beat the game in about 3 hours. Wow i usually have a harder time peelign a banana then beating this game. No offense Vivendi Universal, but I would call this game mediocre. The graphics are'nt overly impresive either. The only thing that was a bit enjoyable was the arsenal of weapons, although i was hoping for more of them. To sum it up i was horribly dissapointed."
1,s*************cks,i sold this game for 4 bucks i wouldve ended up giving it away for 99 cents but unlike the other raters i cant say i didnt give this game a try
4,Dissapointing,"The game is simply monotomous, meaning that you do the same thing over and over in the whole game: you enter a room, kill everyone, the door unlocks, you go through it, you enter a new room, kill everyone, the door unlocks, etc etc. There is no fun in that."
5,True Picture of the Behind Scenes of the Evil-to-the-core CCP,"This book blows the cover of the Chinese Communist Party and their brutal campaign against Falun Gong. If you want to read a book that just tells it like it is, then grab this book, fast. The CCP is a cult organization that cannot tolerate goodness. It is a totally deformed and warped. Terribly evil. The CCP can't tolerate Falun Gong because the CCP is against the tenants of Falung Gong. Falun Gong's practice is based on Truth, Compassion, and Forbearance, however, the CCP's tenants are based on lies, brutality, and it opposes anything that is good and wholesome. The book, you will find, is a very easy read and very reasonably priced."
4,tight Madonna jam,this was my cut back in the day. Madonna sounded soulful and had a nice Groove that truly fit her range. the Production and groove had that feel good early 80's vibe. Madonna back in the day always kept a cut.
1,Terrible.,The scottish brogue and olde english and backwoods setting were too much for me. Gladly tossed it after 1 chapter.
5,Totally lives up to the hype!,"After reading all the online reviews of how well this movie did at SXSW, I was stoked when it came to Blu-Ray. Even though I hadn't seen it, I bought it on faith and I was definitely satisfied. Just the right amount of comedy and action mixed together in a movie that was every boys dream at some point (defend your home town (or block) from invading aliens with a random assortment of weapons. I absolutely loved it! Definitely would recommend to anyone to at least watch if they weren't sold on just flat out buying it."
5,The most stylish film of the year.,"The premise sounded dumb coming out of my friend's mouth.""It's a movie about aliens that come and attack ghetto kids.""This friend usually has good taste so I decided to check it out. Soon enough we were both sitting on the couch, jaws ajar in amazement.It's scary, funny, amazing, crude, surprising, awesome, cool, wild, and most of all... action-packed.The less you know about the film the better but it's a hard R so keep that in mind if you're sensitive to violence/language/drug content.From my blog- [...]"
4,What a surprisingly awesome movie!,"We had no expectations that this would be anything other than a B-film (like Skyline or Cloverfield) but surprizingly Attack the Block was really good! The action starts minutes into the film, it is well acted and the aliens are unique and creepy. It features an ensemble of quirky, likeable characters. It combines plenty of plot twists and surprises. There is humor, suspense, and loads of action that keep you interested all the way to the end. Loads of fun to watch!"
2,MI---hood? not MIB,"With some of the actors, and from the previews, I really wanted to like this one - and it is likely just me, as many seemed to really enjoy it, but I am glad I rented first as it just got a tad annoying after a while -- the ""teeth"" effect was pretty cool and that was about all that kept my interest as long as it did - just could not get into it and won't rent again. So not a bad movie, but 2 stars means ""did not like"" -- and hadda admit, I did not ---- rent first before you purchase as I feel the trailer is better than the film."
2,Waste of time,"Spent the entire movie rooting for the aliens, but alas they lose to ghetto degenerates who the director desperately tries to make sympathetic. Didn't work."
2,bangers and mash,"well, the hype made me look and thats all it took to realize that this is justa brit teenage fantasy flick with unrealistic action and improbable teen dominance. oh, not to mention cheesy effects like 1985 status). someone else already mentioned the strained use of slang....like the fresh prince of bel aire trying to be a G in the hood; contrived...those boys all came from silver spoons and its obvious. right on par with the rest of this director's weak, nerd realm movies. those who compare this with e.t. or even aliens are so far outta their league its laughable. a red box rental wasted and a dollar not sorely missed."
1,Total Garbage,"I want my rental money back. All the positive reviews are totally misleading. Aliens invade and are able to be beaten back by a bunch of thug kids with bats, the movie takes this seriously and there is nothing fun about it. Nothing likeable about any of the characters. Total absolute garbage!"
3,If only life were like this...,"...and the thugs who attacked and robbed you at knifepoint turn out to really be sweet young fellows who only mugged you becoz they dint know you was from our block, see? Yeah, right.Well, it is a comedy after all, when it decides it is, but then again sometimes it's a morality tale about how misunderstood these sweet young criminals are, despite their willingness to attack a young lady five on one with masks on and knives out. Poor guys! So misunderstood, innit?But then the fake-looking alien apes show up, and much hilarity ensues. And a few deaths. But, whatever. There's a few good jokes, a little suspense, and everybody realizes what heroes these guys really are, robbing girls at knifepoint notwithstanding.So just keep that in mind next time you're being robbed: those guys are probably really nice blokes, just victims of society really, and if your block is ever attacked by alien apes, they'll be your best bet, due to their knowledge of pheromones. Count on it, guv!"
3,Action / Horror Movie,"I don't understand the negative reviews this movie got. This movie was nice, perhaps the people judging it were biased and effected by the demonization of one culture by the media and the the superhero whitewashing of another. Don't let the ego projection of what you've aloud yourself to believe about different cultures ruin this movie for you. :)"
4,Oy! Thas-wha'time-tawkin-bout!,"Oy! Thas-wha'time-tawkin-bout! (7.0/10.0)Just when I was getting bored with screenwriting---(where did all the new ideas go?)---Bam! Excellent!Well done, fellas. You can fight on my side in any alien invasion. Coolest monsters I've seen in months.Do check this out with someone you can laugh and scream and cheer with..."
4,"CRUDE, PROFANE, SCARY AND FUNNY","Here's a terrific little film that asks: What if angry, human-devouring aliens landed in South London and had to deal with a mixed ethnicity teen street gang? Crude, profane and funny, this exceptionally well-crafted little UK import hits all the right notes and delivers a superbly poetic, colorful enigmatic stream of British lower-class teen jargon along the way. The kid actors, many of them non-pros, are all terrific and the story reminds how a greater threat can unite and makes us stronger."
1,Sad what passes for good junk these days,"Bratty kids who sound just like nanny-state liberal moviemakers while they commit crimes against women and animals are interesting to some. If the script was made exactly the same but the story was set in America the same folks who are bashing American movies in these reviews would hate it. I love all kinds of weird and cheap movies like Bubba Ho-Tep, Six String Samurai and Repo Man, but this was soulless and dull."
1,I kept waiting for the main characters to die!!,"But instead we had to watch in false hope that the thug-wannabe little bastards would all get killed eventually to no satisfaction. Seriously, I should've waited until Netflix had it for online viewing instead of paying for a rental.If you like the idea of the director making you despise the main characters and then force you to try to cheer for them in the end... either that or you believe pubescent teenagers acting out promoting thug-culture is the only way for them to be ""cool"" these days, then this movie's for you!"
3,"Cool aliens, nice music, but...",Great concept. It suffers from horrible directing and a little bad acting. The alien creatures actually look kinda cool. This movie could use a remake with better effects.
1,"Not funny, horrible special effects","Wow, this movie was a huge dissapointment. I was told that this movie was both very funny and the special effects were top notch. I'm not sure which claim was more wrong.The movie simply is not funny. Here's an example of an attempt at humor: When trying to decide what to do about the dead alien one guy says ""Yo, we should call Simon Cowell because this alien's got talent."" The only thing vaguely funny about the movie was the kid's accents.The special effects were about on par with the movie alien, which was released in 1979.I don't know what someone could possibly be looking for in a movie where they would be even remotely satisfied."
1,"GREAT, FOR 12 AND UNDER","IF YOU'RE MENTALLY OR PHICALLY 12 AND UNDER, THIS IS A FILM FOR YOU. GOOD PRODUCTION VALUE, TOO BAD IT'S WASTED TRYING TO MAKE HUMAN DREK INTO CHARACTERS WE CARE ABOUT. LOTS OF GOOD SCIFIFILMS OUT THERE. IF YOU HAVE A BRAIN, WATCH SOMETHING ELSE."
4,not what I expected -- better!,"The best types of films are the ones that unexpectedly deliver. I saw the preview for this movie and I thought it was going to be a next-gen Monster Squad. Light-hearted, kids killing monsters romp. It's more like Monster Squad meets Misfits meets The Wire. Loved it."
4,Entertaining,"When I first saw this trailer I was on the fence about watching it, now I am glad I did! Its a nice lil action flick that keeps ya entertained. I will buy this movie!"
3,"A mixed bag that hits, more than it misses","I bought this movie solely on the hype it had gotten on various movie websites. My hopes were pretty high, but ultimately I was a bit disappointed with the film. Let me start with the positives.Pros:-The direction and cinemtography are spot on, this is a very well made film.-The creature design is great, it utilizes the CGI pretty well.-The action sequences are entertaining and well shot.Cons:-The main characters are thugs, I hated them right off the bat. Though they do become a bit more likable as the film chugs along, but not by much.Like I said, it hits more than it misses. This movie would be great if the kids were more likeable, (Comparisons to this gang being like the Goonies is laughable.) but as it is I want to slap all of them and tell them to quit acting the fool.The pacing and direction; however, more than make up for this, and ultimately there is fun to be had while watching this movie. I'd say give it a rental before buying."
3,attach the block,"I thought the movie was good, but I got it or my daughter, who is a rabid horror movie fan. She likes it very much so it was on her christmas wish list."
3,Attack the Block,"I saw the review from BDK Reviews for ""Attack The Block""...he rated it highly. I went in thinking it was going to be great. I will say that the premise if really good! It was a story of redemption and triumph. I enjoyed it , but would not call it great. It's a good rental, not worth owning tho'. Also, it was hard to understand their thick English accents, so if you can watch with subtitles, that's encouraged."
3,Attack the Block,"I was expecting something like Shaun of the Dead but sadly I was disappointed. It was like the comedy was ""forced"" and the characters were very one dimentional. The only plus was the aliens. They were very cool. All black but a glow-in-the-dark set of blue teeth."
4,"Fast, Fun, Low Budget","Combining the elements of sci-fi and street gang, this fast paced movie is just the right length. Although low budget it provides enough action, satire and pop culture references to keep it entertaining."
4,Horror and Fun,"Really enjoyed this take on alien invasions.Finally,a new twist on the genre. Keeping the aliens design simple without cheapening the look was a plus. And even though I didnt understand every word in the dialog,the movie was still enjoyable."
4,good movie. very entertaining.,This was a great movie rental. Very funny and scary from Britain. Goood times. This was better than anything with Katherine Heigl or Jennifer Aniston in it - in my opinion.
4,Unexpectedly Good,"We settled in to watch this movie, expecting it to be a bad movie. We were ready to create drinking games, or throw popcorn, or whatever, so we were expecting it to be /fun/, but ultimately bad.The special effects, the sets, and the cinematography were about what we expected, but something weird happened as we watched it -- it was good. The more it went on, the better it actually got. It was funny and charming and ultimately endearing. We watched it like three times.I really do recommend this movie as a fun, interesting and entertaining movie."
3,Still working,I have owned this product for a long time and it continues to work properly. It does not support HC flash cards so it is EOL in my book.
3,Sturdy Glasses,"I agree with the other reviewers that these glasses have a funky shape, which is why I picked them! However, the slim top is a problem when filling with ice from the refrigerator dispenser (ice goes flying out everywhere!) and also hits peoples noses when trying to drink out of them. They are very sturdy. I've had mine three years; none have broken and get washed in the dishwasher daily. However, due to the odd shape and ice problem, I'm looking for others to replace these."
4,happy camper,"Nice heavy duty glasses. stylish in shape and holds well in the hand. Perfect for ""toddy for the body"" time. The price was right also"
3,Funky Shape,"These glasses are very robust. They shipped without breaking and they feel very solid. I haven't broken one yet (this is a miracle!).Unlike most glasses, they taper to the top. When drinking out of the glasses, it hits my nose kind of weird. I guess it's something I'll just have to get used to. Because of their weird shape, they don't fit quite right in the hand. My husband refuses to use them because of the strange shape.These are made very well, but they should taper towards the bottom not the top!"
2,No quality control - avoid this junk!,"I thought I was getting a good deal, and now I know why the price was so low for this set. One of the tall glasses is an an inch and a half taller than the rest of them. Are you serious?"
1,avoid,"Many things can be said about Blue Monday. In short it is the most important and influential dance single of the last 25 years. The only other single I can think of that even comes close in terms of radical originality and lasting influence is Donna Summer's colaboration with Giorgio Moroder ""I Feel Love."" In both cases, there is only one version that you will ever need, and that is the ORIGINAL. It is perfection personified. These updated remixes here add NOTHING to the original, and to me are a slap in the face. Butchery. Simply atrocious. The only saving grace of this cd single is the inclusion of the original 12"" mix."
1,The Deadly Bore,"I fell in love with Agatha Raisin and some 14 novels later, I still try to like her. Yet with ""The Deadly Dance"" I find Agatha to be in the same old rut: she has to be the busiest ""retiree"" there is.Possibly in a move to breathe life in to the Agatha series (Lord knows it needs it) Beaton tries to dabble in the realm of the psychological thriller. The insights into the thoughts of the somewhat sinister 60-ish woman who becomes the first employee of Agatha's newly-formed detective agency seem out of place in a series that is composed of two-dimensional, fluffy characters.The twists and turns of the diseased mind are better left to the more capable creative talents of Ruth Rendell or PD James.This written, I had squeezed up a two-star rating for the novel. Upon reflection, however, I must deduct a star."
4,What a delight is Agatha Raisin!,"I always look forward to the next Agatha Raisin mystery, and this one does not disappoint. Agatha is her usual bumbling, ""bull-in-a-china shop"" self, and she again meets up with some pretty odious characters. What about Emma, her new secretary that she's just hired for her new detective business? And then there's her first real clients - are they what they seem to be? (especially the handsome ex-husband). Anyway, you can bet that murder and mayhem are going to follow her around, but she will persevere as she always does. We get lots of introduction to her two friends Roy and Charles, and they are just as delightful as always. Not a bad book at all!"
3,Deadly Dance,"Typical Agatha Raisin mystery, but this one with a twist as the independent Agatha hires an assistant who almost takes over the business, with deadly results. Fans of Agatha almost always enjoy these books. Just when you think you can ""predict"" what is going to happen, surprises occur to keep you interested."
2,Kindle edition barely readable,"I enjoyed the story but Kindle users, beware. This edition is filled with spelling, typographical and significant formatting mistakes on EVERY page. If you are determined to purchase The Deadly Dance, you may want to consider buying the actual book instead of the Kindle edition."
3,Agatha Goes Professional,"Beaton has split the novel between a couple of heroines in this mystery and Agatha, to me, seems to lose some of her specialness. She's gone professional (opened her own detective agency) and though she still has Agatha sized problems (vanity, jealousy and the need for romance) I got caught up with the woman introduced as her secretary and didn't enjoy the mystery as much. Agatha bumbling into crime solving seems more enjoyable than a professional Agatha with technology experts and retired detectives on her side. Plus she solves small mysteries along with the ""deadly dance"" and the focus gets muddied."
2,Agatha's Lobotomy,As a fan of the A.R. series I was saddened to read this book. Agatha's feisty personality was missing.The laughs have gone. The love has gone. The fight has gone.The light has gone out. Let's hope it's temporary.
4,"Not a classic, but not bad either....","I've been reading this novel for a few days now; not having purchased it, but I signed up for a neat program (yes, it's free) on the publisher's website (www.stmartins.com) where you're sent about 5 minutes worth of reading in sequence every day for a week's worth of each novel, and thus far - it's pretty good. I'm typically a fan of the more classic murder mysteries (which I suspect Beaton is poking fun at to some small extent), but this is a good story, well written, and fairly engaging. It's the perfect example of a book you would buy for brain candy (in my own case, to relieve the eye strain of long days of philosophy) that ends up being a fairly decent read. I would recommend this to just about anyone in search of such a brain candy book and hope they would find the same enjoyment in it that I have so far - can't wait to see what happens to Agatha and Emma in tomorrow's installment!"
2,Deadly Disappointing,"As a long-time Agatha Raisin fan, I opened ""Deadly Dance"" with eager anticipation. What a disappointment! Although the story itself has all the elements of another excellent Agatha Raisin novel, Ms. Beaton's usually entertaining writing style has here turned choppy and abrupt. ""Deadly Dance"" reads like a story outline that an over-eager publisher accidentally printed instead of the finished product. If you're a dedicated reader of the series and can overlook the awkward writing style, you'll probably enjoy the latest adventures of Agatha Raisin. But let's all hope that Ms. Beaton's literary skill returns before the next installment."
3,Another Cotswold Cozy,"Hard to believe this is Agatha #15. This time around, she's opened her own sleuthing business, and her first big case involves death threats, and a narrowly averted attempt, made against a local deb. The clues fall like rain for the alert reader, and it's not too difficult to spot the 2 cases of mistaken identity, and the who's, hows, and whys. But Beaton always offers light, fun reading, and what this one lacks in suspense, it makes up for with its Cotswold charm and wry humor."
3,"Opera Singers, Mostly American",The performances are highly variable both in recorded sound and quality of performances. The album is mis-titled. Ben Heppner is Canadian and Lily Pons was French!
1,Wait for the next version...,"I spent many hours trying to get this to work, but was not successful. I tried all the fixes available on their web site, including downloading a free version upgrade (v1.5). Still no success.I have been a LapLink user for many years, but that product has grown so much with features that I don't need (and grown in price), that I had decided to stick with the old version.When PCsync came along I jumped at the opportunity for the faster USB transfers.. but it is not to be. I'm back in the old version, which remains virtually flawless.I have to say, the company responded to my e-mail enquiries and the product has an excellent satisfaction guaranteed policy: 100 days, 100% satisfaction, 100% money back.Waiting for version 2.0 ..."
3,good but...,This book had the style like her offical website but it just wasn't personal enough. It had the information we all already know. Good parts about the books are the pictures.
3,Not what I expected,I was looking for a book that was easier to use but this book is written more like an advanced placement book. I have no knowledge of sign language and just wanted a basic background and then some practical and common sign language techniques. This book could be used for beginners but would take a while to get through it.
2,Don't use with Sony Handycams,I purchased a 10 pack of these discs with my purchase of a Sony Handycam. I have only been able to get one disc to format. You're not saving any money if they don't work - get Sony discs.
3,Not rewritable in Sony Handycam,"As others have said and anyone can see, these are very inexpensive rewritable mini-dvds. They may be rewritable when using them to hold data in a computer but not in my Sony Handycam.After using a disk in the Handycam, before the disk can be played in a simple dvd player the disk must be finalized in the camera. Using another brand of mini-dvds (JVC, much more expensive) the disks can later be rewritten or added to by telling the camera to ""un-finalize"" the disk. Using these Memorex disks the images are retained well enough but my Handycam cannot ""un-finalize"" the disks for rewriting. I can reuse the disk by reformatting but that, of course, necessitates deleting the information already on the disk.So I give these three stars. On the plus side are the price and the fact that, like most rewritables, you can reformat them or delete the most recently shot image on the disk; but on the negative side is that they can't easily be reopened after finalizing to add new images."
1,Incompatible,"Make sure you know that these will work with your camcorder before buying. Apparently, they work fine with Sony camcorders (the packet too says so) but not with Canon. Also, it's incompatible with my new Panasonic camcorder too. Interestingly, it was displayed as a combo offer when I bought my Panasonic camcorder, which is the reason why I bought it anyway, but got duped."
1,non-compatible with canon dc230,i oedered this product because it was paired with the canon dc230. It is not compatible and should've not been paired with the camera.
1,Incompatible,Check for camcorder compatibility prior to purchasing; not compatible with Canon camcorders.
1,Half of the discs don't work,Horrible deal. WE had to throw away half of the discs because they don't work in our DVD player (even though they were supposed to).
1,Not as advertised,"The Memorex Mini DVDs are exceptional and have worked for me in freezing rain while at horse events and in other extreme conditions. I did not receive memorex DVDs; I got an off brand. Do not order these you will get an off brand. I saw another review that had a similar event but thought maybe they were out for a short period of time. Not so, beware!"
1,ripoff,Price for this product was a rip off it's cheaper to buy them at your local store as i found out quickly
1,These disks dont format for 4:3 aspect ratio,I tried two blank disks of Memorex miniDVD+RW and got disk error message on SONY Handycam DCR DVD-610 camera. I selected 4:3 aspect ratio as the disks will be played on an older model TV. I was only able to format for 16:9 format.
4,DVD-RW for Digital Camera,"A simple product that either works or it doesn't...and these worked...so nothing special here, mostly a matter of price and rapidity and price of delivery.Delivery from this source was too slow."
5,good deal and compatible,"Try to record and play @ dvd player, no problem at allgood product, just follow the instruction"
3,OK for general use,"I bought this pack about an year ago with my Sony DCR-DVD 108 purchase. It was recommended by Amazon with this camcorder. The DVD disks are good for their intended use. The quality of video recorded is very good for first 3-4 uses and then slowly goes down with multiple rewrites.Per my experience, I will recommend to reduce the number of formats. I only format once it is completely fiished with 30 minute recording. Multiple format will result in deterioration of the video quality.Also, handle them with care. Scratches etc can damage them permanently as with all CDs/DVDs."
1,poor,Does not work. Can't get ahold of seller. if seller would contact me for refund that would be great!
1,dissapointment,"The dvds arrived on time. The package was opened and the DVDs do not read in the Canon DC50 camcorder it was bought for. From what I am seeing in the one staer reviews is these DVDs are not compatible with some camcorders. Sony DVDs of the same type worked fine. The funny part is if they were opened they were probably returned by someone else. Why send them to me? This is very unusual. I am usually happy with my amazon purchases. It gets one star for arriving in a timely manner, and hopefully for their return policy."
1,DVD +RW review,Does not work with the camera we purchased. Would like to return these but the 30 days is up.
5,Memorex Mini-DVDs great value,These mini-dvds are great. They're such a bargain compared to the Sony equivalent. Fast delivery too.
2,Not compatible with Canon,Use the silver package DVD-RW they work fine. I would ask that the package be labeled better.
5,GO WITH THE FLOW>,"The track that started it all in 1990 and on. Vogue This is when I thought Madonna was going to stay trapped in the 80's, Like many who did. First multi-platinum single by a female artist, Over 2 million in the US. MADONNA is the queen of pop and music."
3,Here's a review of the actual CD! Not Madonna,"Yes, yes, Madonna is fantastic, and ""Vogue"" is fantastic...but how's about someone review the actual recording? Oh, here's one! OK, the original album version is NOT on here, and the BEST version is NOT on here either (the best being the version that appears in the Immaculate Collection). The first track is basically an edit, the other three are extended versions/mixes. They all pretty much sound the same....it is not remixed differently. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE this song, but this maxi-single could have been MUCH better, especially with a song like THIS!!"
5,Career Highlight,"Over the course of her almost 20 year career, Madonna has had many many good moments, this being one of them. Vogue is just simply one of the greatest dance anthems there is, Ive never heard a song put together quite like this one. Its amazing, the melody and lyrics will stay in your head and have you singing along. The video for this song was also amazing as well. The remixes are great for this single, it is a must have for any fans."
2,Overrated,"This has to be the most overrated single of Madonna's career. I personally detest it, most likely due to the overexposure, but honestly, the song is not superior to most of Madonna's work. In fact, it's inferior. Too much hype."
4,A star is born,"I was surprised to see that Shu Qi made a video that showcases her natural beauty. This video was made before Shu Qi starred in movies such as So Close, Georgeous and The Transporter. There is no talking in this video, just Shu Qi posing in front of the camera with some annoying music in the background. But if you love Shu Qi and want to see her in all her natural glory, then this is a DVD to get."
4,There great,I love these sheets. they are one of the most comfortable set of sheets That I have ever owned. The only problem that I have with these sheets is that they don't like to stay on the bed. They like to travel off the corners. So every morning you remake the bed. But I do love these sheets.
2,now I know why they were on sale!,"I loved these sheets when I first bought them! Great color, super soft, big enough to fit my pillow top mattress comfortably...then I washed them...following the directions on the packaging. Gentle wash, color safe detergent, cold water, etc.They are now polka-dotted-faded white and pink in spots from where the color ran. From one washing. What a waste."
3,Time to pay the Piper!,"Back in Action (1994) Roddy Piper (They Live) and Billy Blanks (Showdown) star in this ""Kops and Kickboxers"" movie. Piper's the policeman whose partner is killed, and Blanks has the dangerous feet and the kidnapped sister, so pretty soon the blitz is on and the bad guys don't stand a chance. I'm really not a fan of the glut of kickboxing movies from this period, but I saw this because I like Piper. He's funny playing the stock loner cop character. On the flip side, though, we have the aptly named Blanks. Although he seem competent when he's applying his feet liberally to some guy's head, but he's not much of an actor. He's also extremely goofy looking. (And I hope he never reads this!) He should probably stick to his Tae Bo tapes. If you like the kind of movie where people throw down their guns so they can kick each other, you'd probably enjoy this. Otherwise, steer clear! Also with Nigel Bennett (Darkman III)."
4,Billy Blanks makes an action movie and action movie,"Billy Blanks is the man who keeps thousands maybe millions of people in great shape. Combining that with the fact that he is a seven time world karate champion and has been in twenty movies all together it is exciting to watch. I don't have much to say really except for BILLY BLANKS, I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,A quick note of recommendation,"The version of ""Rag Bag"" which appears on this album could be considered canonical of the classic Lindley performance of this song... it is a must have if you are a Lindley fan!.. or even just a fan of great music. I hope at the very least that the MP3s will be available for purchase sometime here in the near future."
3,Handle breaks after several uses,"I like the design of this brush as far as how well it cleans large bottles and that it has a seperate nipple brush. The price is also very reasonable. The only thing that disappoints me is the metal part right above the handle is weak and breaks after several uses. I thought this might be the case with just one brush, but it happened to all the ones that I bought. I change my brushes frequently to avoid a germ breeding ground, but it still breaks before that time.For the price and the design, and for how frequently I throw out my brushes, I would probably still buy this brush. But it is a little annoying to clean the bottle with a brush handle that is broken in half."
3,Odd design,"As you can see from the picture, the nipple brush comes out of the end of the brush and surprisingly stays in place when not in use. The sponge at the bottle end is a little badly designed. The end of the wire hooks around and the sponge is placed in the crook of the hook. The sponge is always coming out of place and the wire is still a bit flimsy and tends to get all bendy if you get aggressive with it. It is a perfectly fine bottle brush, nothing hugely good or bad about it."
1,"Horrible, DO NOT BUY","These are the worst bottle brushes out there. They are not sturdy and bend while washing. I used mine only 5 times and the sponge at the top came off. I am pumping and then bottle feeding 5 times a day so I need a reliable brush to wash my breast pump parts and my Dr. Brown bottles, and these do not do the job. So far my favorite have been the Munchkin with the sponge on the top, they look like these but hold up much better. Unfortunately I can't find them on Amazon."
2,Broke to early!,This brush was light and not a great cleaner. The sponge of the brush came off after the 3rd use. The nipple brushes were standard. Don't waste the money Walmart has a better brush.
3,Not totally Convinced,"I have been using this brush for a week now, and after a week, I see that the sponge no longer has the same cleaning effect as it had as new, for what I expected is too soon to have this problem.. The nipple brush is another story that one I really do like it, much better than others. I recommend this product for it's cheap price, but consider that you may have to buy more sooner than you would like to."
4,Good But Not Great,I expected more specific information. Not just what is provided by the Mormon Church. There is much more in the salt lake basin than the city of Salt Lake.
3,Bush wouldn't get rid of Osama Bin Laden,More than 3 years after Osama Bin Laden and his gang attacked us we still are having to deal with his threats. We need a president who will not lose sight of our true enemies. After losing so many of our young men and women and spending so much money we are no safer than we were on 9/11!What was the point?Please vote for John Kerry.
5,All the Berlitz 'Essential' Books are excellent!,"My first Berlitz course was an 8 week total immersion Russian course. It was one on one 8 hours a day. And the book we used as the base of my learning? Yep, Berlitz Essential Russian. The books seem basic but what they are doing is building a foundation of the language in a very precise and methodical way. This foundation then allows you to easily learn the language at an accelerated rate by simply increasing vocabulary. I speak Russian well now and work in Moscow often without problems. It takes a great deal of work, but Berlitz knows how to teach languages. I'm now doing the same with German. This book is not for the casual traveler looking to learn a few quick phrases. This/these books will give you the building blocks necessary to learn and speak the language effectively. And remember if you are self-teaching, you will need some sort of audible version of the language. Rosetta Stone is an excellent substitute for an instructor. Good Luck!"
1,full of typos,"I'm surprised this has positive reviews at all. It is full of typos, especially in the exercises. Also the exercises aren't so helpful--there are too few. The different chapters do offer lots of grammar but then really aren't followed up by exercises that will reinforce the lessons. The exercises tend to be limited to questions based on the dialogues at the beginning. But these questions are of the sort which require simple parroting back information."
3,Great book--No CD,"The Berlitz Essential series is a really great introduction to a new language. I have the older version for German and recently ordered a new edition since they come with a CD of the dialogs. The product review on Amazon said it came with a CD. However, no CD included when the book arrived. So that's a total waste of my time and money. Bummer."
5,GREAT grilling book,"The Buena Vista Cocktails, Mole-rub Turkey Tenderloin and Chocolate Pound Cake are all excellent. This book is well-designed and beautifully presented. I have also made extensive use of Rodriguez's ceviche book. Can't go wrong with either of these. The more exotic ingredients are worth the search. Happy eating."
5,Ideal para personas exiliadas o desexiliadas,"Me identifique tanto con el personaje de Javier Montes porque por distintos motivos yo tambien deje mi pais y me fui a vivir a otro muy lejano, no tan solo cultural y linguisticamente sino tambien geograficamente. No fueron 12 largos aÃ±os como en el caso de Javier que se fue por motivos politicos cosa que tuvo que ser aun mas dificil. Me encanta que este escritor tome en cuenta la relacion del personaje con sus hermanos, porque el echo de tener vinculos sanguineos no implica que tengamos que forsozamente aprender a querernos. El final fue inesperado pero el ingenioso de Mario Benedetti nos permite deducir que vendra despues. Excelente libro el cual recomiendo grandemente."
1,$199.99????,Seriously? $199.99 for this CD. Please tell me that its supposed to be $19.99 because if its not you are HIGH!!!!!
5,Affrodable OEM replacement exhaust,"This cat-back replacement exhaust with muffler fit my Toyota Pickup perfectly. It is mild steel (not stainless), so I wouldn't recommend it for Rust Belt states, but anywhere else the Walker unit provides an excellent low-cost alternative to a $500 Midas visit. 30 minute job with a few wrenches and a socket set."
3,No specifications until you get the box,"It does not say on the web page what the pressure and rate of air flow are. I just got mine and I can tell you what the box says:Good: 125-135 psi at 1-15 gallonsbetter: 125 psi at 16-29 gallonsbetter: 150-175 psi at 1-15 gallonsbest: 125 or higher at least 30 gallonsbest: 135 or higher at least 16 gallonsSo for example, my compressor is maximum 115psi, 8 gallons. This does not quite make it into the ""Good"" catagory, so I guess I have to send mine back. I guess I better email customer service!"
3,I think the product would be great....though i never got a chance to use it,"I was very excited to get an additional case for my treo 680. It looked pretty and looked like it was a good case to use while my phone was charging. After 2 weeks of waiting for this product to come i e-mailed amazon, and then the seller. They were very nice and said they were sorry for the delay and they would re-ship it if it didn't come soon. After a month i e-mailed them again and they were again nice but they insisted it was already delivered. (I get packages every week from amazon with no problem, but from this seller there was a huge problem). I told them i did not receive it and they said they would re-ship the item. After 2 months of not getting the item and getting fed up with waiting so long i asked for a refund. One that i never got...I am upset but i did not take a huge loss. Consider the seller before buying the product."
4,Sturdy and helpful,"This is a pretty heavy duty silicone, non-slip and protective, would recommend it to all treo users."
4,How This Book made me feel,I have read few books that have made me feel as this one did. I could feel the authors emotions in every page. I think that there are alot of authors that write well but are unable to take you with them when they write. Mr. Stoke has that rare quality that lets you feel what he is feeling but also retain your own take on his words. I highly recomend this book to people who want to take an emotional journey.
2,Would not recommend,Very disappointed. The size is what I would consider for making cones for very small children.
1,Don't waste your money,Wooden cone. Never has worked as easy as it would seem. Maybe it's my waffle but other things would work as well.
3,V455 Pizzelle-Cone Roller,Is a little difficult to use. The cones are hard to shape. They break easily.
4,Gamecube Racing Wheel,"We looked for a racing wheel for my husband to use for over two years. The prices were outrageous so we kept putting off getting one. When I found this one on Amazon, it was intended as a Christmas gift and my husband was very happy to get it. The only issue with it, is that it does not adhere to surfaces too well, so we cut out a piece of cupboard liner sponge and placed it on a piece of wood. Works fine."
1,Doesn't work,"Nice Christmas present! Imagine your kid's faces as they open it and are excited to play with it. Then, imagine their faces again as it does not work.Call customer service and you can stay on hold for over an hour without talking to anyone. Try emailing and get an auto response saying they hope you are enjoying your purchase.Finally after being on hold for 1 hour and then again for 45 minutes you can speak to a person! Result--pay at your expense to ship it to Miami and wait to a replacement!"
4,Mediocre Indeed,I bought this for my son and he said it was good but it looks fairly average and really may not be worth bothering as for bit more you can buy a better one that is better than this one.Overall. The wheel is average.Beanstalks.
4,WORSE product ever,"I bought this wheel on 01/02/03 and it was BAD!! It worked for Need For Speed Underground but it was very hard to control the cars. It was good to play drifting but circuit, sprint, and drag ..... was not easy. When I first tried it, I couldn't even make the car go straight. I advise you NOT to but this wheel. This wheel will waste ur time...."
4,Like really driving a car!,"This steering wheel is really fun! But you can't make the sharp ,sharp turns!"
1,The MOMO one is better.,"This wheel is the worst wheel I ever bought. You know why because it's from Intec. Never buy cheap wheels like this one because it's cheap for crying out loud. if you want a better one go buy the Logitech MOMO wheel. It's a little over $100 because the quality is much better and it's more durable. You want to know why, because it's more expensive and better than any Intec racing wheel.I give this wheel only 1 star because because like one kid said the wheel literally snapped in half.Just remember INTEC STINKS and always choose quality over price.Hope you like my review"
1,Poor quality !!!! Not worth $1,"I bought this as a Christmas gift and how disappointing this was to my 12 yr old daughter!!! It stopped working after about an hour of play. At first, it was just almost impossible to keep control of the car and then it wouldn't steer straight. Then it just stopped working within a hour of playing!!! Very disappointing. DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!"
1,Disappointed 10 year old Gamecube Player,Watch out if you own a GameCube. The G5285 model...with 7 buttons across the top DOES NOT have the vibrations and the pedals don't work on GC. You have to get the new and improved version. It's not until you read the instruction manual CLOSELY that you see these functions work only for PS2 and other systems. Now we take our three sons back to the store to spend the additional money to upgrade to a more expensive model. I don't see the new and improved model on the Toys website but it is the one on the Toys site isn't even on the manufacturer's site.
2,Steering column broke on the first day.,"My son got this Intec Racing Wheel for Christmas this year. He (we) are using it with his X-Box. Overall it's pretty fun, but very different from playing with the standard controller. You'll have a small learning curve.The disappointing thing was the locking lever for the tilt function broke the first day of play. Now the wheel won't lock into any position. Back to the store! We'll consider a more expensive wheel hoping that it will be stronger.It's a good wheel, just be gentle with it!"
1,An Adult's Review,"I have never bought a racing wheel but like the other reviews have already said, the $10 wheel was cheap enough to try out. Maybe I got a defective wheel (I'm in the process of getting a replacement) but the wheel did not work with Grand Turismo 4 as advertised. There was some sort of loss of acceleration going on with the pedal or with the ""X-Button"" on the wheel. I could not get the wheel or pedals to work. I made sure that the analog sticks were working fine on the dual-shock controller and that was working just fine. Like I said, I may have gotten a defective wheel but with the other reviews in, I say this thing is a piece of junk. Let the buyer beware...."
1,THIS STINKS!!!!,The pedals stopped working after 30 minutes!!Never buy this for anyone!!It is the Worst toy ever!!!!
5,PS2 racing wheel,This wheel is da-bomb! It is really fun to play with ....especially when your playing a car racing game!!you should try it!!
4,Need help with this wheel,"I cannot seem to make this wheel work with Gamecube. I've tried it with HotWheels Velocity X and the game simply doesn't seem to respond to the wheel at all. I have it attached, with the Gamecube adapter, to controller slot #1. If anyone knows how to make this work, I'd really appreciate a comment being left here. Thank you."
4,Realistic!!!,It is very realistic!! It works like a real steering wheel!! It has a great price. ...I love it you have to get this steering wheel!!
2,not what i expected,"I BOUGHT MINE AT TOYSRUS, BECAUSE IT'S ALL THEY HAD FOR GAMECUBE. NOT WHAT I EXPECTED, OH WELL! IT WAS ONLY 40 BUCKS, I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER, THE GAME I TRIED IT WITH WAS AUTO MODELLISTA, BIG MISTAKE! I'M HAVING MY WIFE RETURN IT FIRST THING TOMORROW."
4,????,"I'm looking online at websites of stores in Northern Virginia that might have PS2 racing wheels that can work with the game Need For Speed Underground cause playing that game with a controller is not very comfortable bacause you always have to hold the X button to accelerate so I wana get a wheel so it would be more comfortable to play. Also, if you know where I can get a good wheel that works for Need For Speed, please e-mail me and tell me !!"
2,Great when it's working.,My son was so excited when he received his racing wheel. He had two days of fun. Then it basically quit working. Bolts were dropping out of the bottom of the unit. I would not recommend this particular racing wheel.
1,This Wheel is garbage,"I juz got this wheel today and i'll be taking it back as soon as i can get back to the store. It has resistance, but so little that it is almost imperceivable. That gets so irritating because you aren't able to get full control. ! Dont buy this wheel! NO RESISTANCE! very little force feedback."
2,An O.K. Wheel But...,I got this wheel for christmas..it lasted for awhile but after like a month or so and it snapped in half litterally but if you are the serious racer like I am I would look for something else.
5,Made grandson very HAPPY!,"My grandson found the site for me to buy the Racing Wheel. The packagecame in great condition, the Wheel was like brand new and he loved it.Would definitely buy from them again."
1,Not as good as hoped,"After using Sony controllers, this unit does not translate well to the game. Completely different feel, my son gave up after 5 or 6 tries. He really wanted this, too. Nice idea, but not good enough."
1,Save your money!!!,"I gave it one star only b/c it won't accept less! This wheel is JUNK!!! Reaction time is slow,control is almost non-existant. Gas pedal works on circuit, but not on drag. Steering lock begins at the 10 and 2 positions,and by then you are way out of control. Spend your cash on something else."
1,Absolutey positively garbage,These wheels are terrible! Got one and was DOA. Exchanged it for another and got one day out of it until the gas pedal failed to work. Intec should be ashamed of themselves for making such crappy products. How do the members Intec sleep at night!!! Steer clear (no pun intended) of this product! Remember I warned you...
1,Messed up my PS2,Tried to use this on my PS2 and it didn't work. I even exchanged it and still no luck. I believe it messed up my PS2 since now I cannot get vibrations to work with any controllers (and they worked before). I do NOT recommend for PS2 users!
1,Not even worth $10.,I bought this after Xmas for just $10. The lock for the steering broke after an hour. Hard to figure out all the buttons. Gas pedal touchy.
1,Do not buy,I am just about fed up with this wheel. There is little response when being turned. I do not suggest this wheel in anyway.
5,A really unique little lamp!!!,"As hard as this will be for sports fans to hear, this is actually a ""pretty"" lamp. It's not feminine by any stretch, but it is beautifully crafted and well put-together. A little expensive for a lamp, but made for a good Christmas gift for my nephew."
2,"Not the ""Orgignal"" Max Rebo Band :(","After receiving this, I was expecting the original music from Max Rebo and his band as heard in the original Jedi (before Lucas trash the audio soundtrack UGH!).This has that lame song that was ""created"" for the special edition of Jedi.Now Max and the band originally performed at least two songs in the ""classic"" Jedi. 'Laptinek' which was sung by Sny Snoodles (pardon my spelling on the song and singer).And of course the real cool jam they did while Jabba's barge was cruising through the desert to the pit.But those two songs are not present on this CD."
4,Feeling Alone While Surrounded by Loved Ones...,"Artist Josey Duprey is a victim of breast cancer. A proud woman, she decides to deal with it alone and doesn't tell her lover, Ellen. Ellen has proposed they move in together and is confused at Josey's keeping distance between them. To confuse things even more, Josey's niece Annie comes to live with her after having problems at school. This is a perfect excuse for Josey to keep Ellen at arm's length. Annie doesn't want to live with her aunt, but has been forced to by her mother. Over the summer, she falls for the daughter of the local hardware store owner and finds out about the pains that come with a first ""love.""This was my first Calhoun read. It was well-written and dealt eloquently with a painful subject (i.e., breast cancer). Cheers to the author for being brave enough to combine this with a true love story.Although not a ""must read"" book, 'Woman in the Mirror' is certainly one I would recommend without hesitation."
4,great product slow delivery,"Took 10 days before product was shipped, 3 in transit. Product is wonderful but I would recommend ordering from a better seller. These guys were slower than the government..."
3,It does the job,Can't say that this is a great product or not but it carries my daughter's guitar just fine and has not broken or frayed in the two months we've had it.
5,"Seems durable, nice padding and storage for books","Just what we needed and good price. I have been planning to buy a hard case but opted for this instead due to shipping costs. Not disappointed. Nice ans sturdy case, especially love the pocket for carrying guitar lesson books."
5,"Fans of the song ""Dry your eyes"" will not be disappointed!","I've been burned plenty of times from buying a CD after only having heard one song, but this CD is definitely an exception. After hearing ""Dry Your Eyes"" on WBER 90.5, I went out and bought the CD, figuring that at the least I'd be supporting a local band. I can tell already after one listening that it'll be one of those CDs that I always listen to in its entirity."
4,A Trip Out Song,THe melody here is classic.together with Kim Bassinger Scandalous gets a whole different vibe&Feeling.I really dug the Guitar&Sly Stone Inspired Talk Box Part.The Horn of Eric Leeds was Hitting.When 2 are in Love&Sex don't really compare after the long Version of Scandalous.it's a Trip out take.
4,Steamy Prince '89 single,"""Scandalous"" has always been a good ballad with a jazzy beat and R&B sexuality. In this single, the song is separated into three parts. ""The Crime"" is the song over an intimate meeting with Kim Basinger (""Vicki Vale""). It's not X-rated, but the sighs do suggest more than just talk is going on. ""The Passion"" is a slight remix with added vocals to give it more of an old time soul feel than before. ""The Rapture"" is an unconventional dub that famous guitar style, which helped, pack a ""Pow!"" to the ""Batman"" Soundtrack. ""Sex"" is a cool b-side of light funk that really was Prince's sound around the time. It should have been on the album. ""When 2 R In Love"" is a sexy ballad from ""Lovesexy"". It has a great old time R&B feel.In all a nice collectable single with a few extras, but don't look for some kind of dance version to the song. The 3 parts of the song are complementary to each other and click well. A good timepiece of his cool 1989 sound which is very unique and misunderstood"
5,I love this cd...,"this is a great maxi single with different versions of the ""Scandalous"" hit from the Batman era. :) I love Prince!"
1,BIASED HISTORY LESSON,"This DVD was little more than a History lesson albeit biased about Mr. Dylan . Very little music or performances . Short clips from public domain,no interviews with the musicians . THIS DVD IS NOT ENDORSED BY DYLAN OR HIS CO. !!! TALKING HEADS RAMBLING ON AND ON !!! There is an interview with Dylan at the end with the press , though no video ."
1,Don't waste your money on this book!,"It is amazing that the author found a publisher for this material. The ""ideas"" range from basic advise that you get in ANY article or book on weight loss (eat less, exercise more) to the ridiculous. Examples of the latter include the recommendation to sleep in one's workout clothes to facilitate morning exercise, and eating on dark colored plates as it supposedly promotes fullness! A great many of the 1001 ideas are low fat recipes. Not why I bought the book. It is the first book I ever returned to amazon.com (and I buy a lot of them). Anyone looking for new ways to get motivated, stay motivated or viable weight loss techniques will be severely disappointed!"
4,well i would like to get further information,"Well i am intersted in buying the book , however i would like to have some further information. Could you send me some further information please? Thank you"
3,More masks,"Steve will never forget the mask Carly Beth used last Halloween. The coach of an unruly football team of first graders, he decides he'll scare the kids good on Halloween. He makes the reluctant Carly Beth tell him where she got her mask.Steve gets a scary mask showing an old man with spiders in his hair. He puts it on but immediately he starts feeling so tired and old. Anyone who has read the haunted mask 1 knows how hard it is to get it off.The theme may be too weird for some, but the story is good. I also liked how the story is set in the same universe as The haunted mask 1, yet the main character is one of her friends. It's a refreshing take on a sequel."
2,Goosebumps,This book was disappointing. I would rank the book a 2 out of 5. The story is about kids playing jokes on each other. The jokes would be to scare each other. The main person in the story is Steve. Steve coaches the first grade soccer team for Walnut Avenue Middle School. He was trying to scare his friends. I did not find this book to be scary. Younger students in 5-8th grade might find it more interesting.
4,not as good as haunted mask 1,"Dan Dowding, age 10The haunted mask 2 wasn't as good as the haunted mask 1 because when he put on the mask, he didn't do that much; he just scared a little kid and got real old and cramped his bones."
1,boring a lot,steve sure is not that scary as for carly beth. For one thing he did not scare more than 2 people and he looked just plain. So i tell you not to read this book.
3,Haunted Mask,"I read the Haunted Mask. The book had a pretty well written plot. I think that this book is very suitable for younger readers such as 3rd and 4th grade children. I myself am in 8th grade and sort of found the book easy, and not very challenging to read. Some other pretty good characteristics of the book are. Good description of what is taking place etc. Great action, makes you feel as if you are the character that is in the book. Last but not least the book has very good attention getting devices. That is all for my book review.Sincerely, Brett Heringhaus"
4,The Haunted Mask II,"This book was realy good, it starts Off with Steve who Is coaching the first grade soccer team. Well they make him realy mad and he wants to get back at them for what they did. So he goes to his enemy Who is carly beth and asks her where she got her mask. When She tells him he goes and gets one but when he put it on he realizes its not just a mask But a creature. He cant get it off so he goes to carly beth she sais you should think of a happy thought so he does. Nothing happens so he goes to where he got it and found bodys that match and found the one that matched. Then his mask jumped onto the body."
3,Not that bad .. not that good either.,"This was kind of a momemtum killer CD from a good band that was doing a good thing prior to this release. After the succuss of Doomsday - F&J; lost their main man in bassist Jason Newstead BUT carried on with a very strong release in No Place For Disgrace. They proved that the loss of Newstead wasn't going to hold them back and had some good momentum going. Then they released this. It's not a bad disc ... it's just not very good either. It does have it's ups but also it downs.The band still carried on and has some strong releases after this one, this one just kind of killed their momentum for awhile."
1,Lame Excuse for a Great Band,"This was a very directionless album put out by a band who put out some of the greatest albums of the power metal era. I'd much prefer ""Drift"", ""Doomsday"", or ""Cuatro"" compared to this poorly produced mindless slab of metal sludge. The only high points on this were ""Suffer the Masses"" and ""The Master Sleeps"", outside of that, songs like ""Scars"" sounded like they were recorded across telephone lines rather than a good studio."
1,this would have been good in 1989,granted this item costs $20.00... but if you are looking for good greeting card software......look else where.... i should have gone to Hallmark and bought 4 cards for $20... at least i would have got quality.
1,"Jack of all trades, master of none?",I have just spent an hour trying to customize a certificate from one of their templates. No success! This product is not at all intuitive; the Help is not helpful; there is no tutorial; there's no explanation of what's on the 8 CR-ROMs included. A waste of time and money.
2,Go to a library....,"Basically, if you can get past the terse text you will find a very, very out-dated system of thought. Andre Breton may have been revolutionary then, but now it is just a re-hash of an old, dilapitated art school that has nothing more to say."
5,The best park substitute,Disney's Happiest Celebration on Earth CD is the best alternative to actually being in the park; the music sets the listener on a clock-wise path that very effectively recreates a Disneyland visit.Both long established favorites and more obscure themes are represented on the disc; it's very easy to imagine becoming as fond of the recordings as an actual visit to the Happiest Place on Earth.
3,Remember when,The album is not bad but I really bought the album for just one song: Remember When by LeAnn Rimes. That is a wonderful song and brings back a lot of memories.
5,Happy Me,"I had owned this once before but sadly I was no longer in possession of it. Lets just say that I love this cd so much the first time around, that I was willing to pay a little more to get it back. It truly is the soundtrack of Disneyland!"
2,Not what you really hear at Disneyland!,"I am really really mad that I spent $15+ on this CD! I thought that it was going to have the soundtrack for the fireworks show (it DID NOT) and Fantasmic (NOPE) and the Parade of Dreams (NO WAY)! And to top this poop album off, they didn't even include the full track for Space Mountain- just a shortened version! Are you kidding me? It's just not the same without the space-alien creepy oooOOOooooOO and the ""Launch in 5, 4, 3..."" You know what I mean!Where's the CD that has the ACTUAL soundtrack of the Disneyland park? More ride tracks, more show tracks, maybe even some of the tunes that get you in the Disney spirit when walking down Main Street? (It'd be nice to have one for California Adventure, too, but hey. One park at a time, I guess)."
5,This is great!!,"We try to visit Disney World at least every other year, an spend the rest of the time counting down to our next visit. I discovered MouseWorld radio, which directed me to Amazon to buy this CD. We absolutely love it!!! This makes us feel like we are on the ride! We especially love the Splash Mountain tunes - it takes you through the entire ride, and we even get nervous when it gets to the point of the final drop!!! We actually fall asleep to this every night, and will continue to do so until our trip Dec. 17!"
4,Disney at its best!,"This is a wonderful CD! I have been going to Disneyland since a child (now a grandma). The songs selected truly capture the spirit of the magical kingdom. It brought back such wonderful, happy moments. A great CD for all ages."
4,Some Disney Ride Theme Songs and a Few Other Classics,"The Tiki Room, Pirates, Haunted Mansion, Splash Mountain...all the songs to get you remenishing about the Park or helping you lookforward to an upcoming trip!I dont care for Leann Rhymes, but if you do there is a song there for you.There are other CD's with more classics, but this on eis a good one becauseof the amount of content from the rides."
4,If you want more...,"After just returning from Disneyland with the 2-disc set of ""Happiest Homecoming on Earth-the Official Album of the Disneyland Resort"" I can tell you that this 1-disc set is good if you just want a sampling but the 2-disc set is even better. If you are really into having a good set of Disneyland songs from rides and attractions and you can't get to Disneyland to buy the 2-disc set, try the 6-disc set ""A Musical History of Disneyland [BOX SET] [ORIGINAL RECORDING REMASTERED]"" here at Amazon.com which also comes with a book."
5,A Welcome Update of the Essential Disney Experience,"I always enjoy the music you hear when visiting Disney World. This is comprehensive album covering all the parks worldwide. There are a few surprises here such as WALT DISNEY'S DEDICATION OF DISNEYLAND of July 17th, 1955. THERE'S A GREAT BIG BEAUTIFUL TOMORROW from the Carousel of Progress is very endearing. GRIM, GRINNING GHOST from The Haunted Mansion and YO HO (A PIRATE'S LIFE FOR ME) from the Pirates of the Caribbean have become true classics. I certainly can not forget THE TIKI, TIKI, TIKI ROOM."
4,Ms Tiffany,I love this CD as much as I loved her when she first came on the scene!This young lady is so talented
5,Lund window vents,"I was able to install these by myself in less than 10 minutes! Was very simple. (keep in mind I am not only a women, I am blonde! lol)"
4,End Time Warriors,This book really makes you sit up and pay attention to your prayer life......are you praying for God or for yourself.....Are you building God's Kingdom or your own kingdom...do you play and or compete with each other in warfare or do you do God's warfare? God is looking for Kingdom builders....this book makes us look to see if we are ones! And will help to show each of us how to be if we aren't. Looking forward to finishing the book.
1,Beware - Not as advertised!,"I ordered this clock because the description said it was ""Made in USA"".Unfortunately the clock I received is clearly: ""Made in China"".So, if you are looking for an American product you need to look elsewhere.EdW"
5,Richard in his element,"Having hear RS in concert a number of times over the years, it always has been a wonderful experience to hear him re-interpret his own songs. So it is an easy bridge to hearing his covers of some of the songs he likes best/has been influenced by most. As far as production and musical maturity, this project is miles ahead of the ""Cry, Cry, Cry"" CD, however enjoyable that was in places. RS clearly feels a close bond with these songs, and his approach is to cherish them and explore them as narratives. Arrangements are typically simple and unobtrusive, but playing throughout is exemplary. RS' voice continues to develop depth and richness, and this is a fine example of a top notch song writer pouring his heart into honoring those that helped pave the way for him."
5,"South of Delia, Richard Shindell",Richard Shindell just keeps getting better. This cd is one of his best. I like every song and that hardly ever happens.
3,"A LITTLE MORE SPICE, PLEASE","As an historical addendum, the Original London Cast album is a close reproduction of the original Broadway recording and has found a place in my library, but for real pzazz go to the Broadway album. I was also surprised to read that Marilyn Horne dubbed LOVE LOOK AWAY in the film version. From CARMEN JONES to FLOWER DRUM SONG....guess she really shone for Hammerstein....anyway, this is an all right reproduction, but the OBC still is the best."
5,One of America's pioneer roads,"When you drive up the ""left coast"" in California, whether it be along Interstate 5 in the San Diego area, old U. S. Highway 101 or California State Highway 1, you see the familiar mission bells. This book tells the story behind those bells and one of America's great pathways. This road was originally blazed to connect California's mission system, and is a good reference point for a visit to any or all of the missions."
4,Mildly Entertaining,"Maybe it's because I recently revisited my past by playing Commodore 64 games but WWE Raw for PC has some really outstanding graphics for a PC game. There are different matches to choose from: Single, Tag Team, Hardcore, Triple Treat, Fatal Fourway, King Of The Ring, all championship belts are up for grabs and more options than I care to even exercise. It is old in the since that characters are from 1 year ago and that may be reflected in the price. Raven walks down the ramp with a shopping cart of harcore items and Perry Saturn walks down with Moppy.My only lament is that it seems the game is an Xbox conversion rather than a made for PC game as evident is the lack of multiple keyboard keys to enter in a wrestler's name.Pentium 500 Minimum, 64MB RAM,128 MB required for Windows XP."
4,good game lacks some things though,"this is a great wrestling game but i think they should work on a few things like more match types,more wrestlers and would it hurt to add some old ones? i dont mean really old i just mean like the coporate ministry,it may not exist anymore but i personally think it was one of the most memeroble times.adding a storyline would make this game a top class game even if you use an old storyline it shows inprovement.overall this is a good game but i'm begging you please put a storyline in the next one."
2,Not reliable...,"I like my watch a lot... the fact that it does not have backlight and hard to read at night and the sync thing (dials vs. digital) I can live with.The fact that it was broken twice already (same exact thing - stuck on stopwatch and not allow returning back to showing the time) is very frustrating, especially since I have it for less then a year.FYI - Tissot will not talk to you if you have an issue. You will have to use the warranty given by Amazon and it is not good, sorry to say.Not only that they are not responsive and it took 3 calls and screamin on a supervisor to get a status of the repair but 2 months later the same thing happened again and you have no one to talk to, just the warranty company.Remember - Tissot will not talk to you and after 30 days Amazon will not talk to you as well."
3,Disappointed,"I was eager to hear this record, given its prominence, but it was a bit of a let down. Certianly, nobody can touch Reiner's ferocious attack, bombastic yet exact. But in both the 5th and the Corolian here, his tempi are just too fast. They fall forward, and the players do too! The strings can't keep up! Just not enough fast-twitch fibers to execute these tempi well. Reiner's 1955 recording of the 3rd wows me, but these don't."
5,Great Piano Trio Jazz...,"consisting of four bop standards, a couple of bossa nova treatments, and three others of a different category. ""Because You're Mine"" dates back to the fifties where it was popularized enough by Mario Lanza that a lot of couples chose it as one of the selections to be played at their exchange of marriage vows. Monty gives a gorgeous treatment of this old tune. The Rolling Stones standard, ""I Can't Get No Satisfaction"", is a hard swinging arrangement showing Monty's Oscar Peterson influence. ""Happy Talk"", from ""South Pacific"", is a familiar tune that hasn't been recorded that often but gets a good workout here by all of the trio.If you can obtain it, this is a fine cd with appeal to Monty Alexander fans or aficionados of straight ahead jazz piano trio."
3,"Boring, but useful","The book is quite basic and introductory. I think it would be useful to many people who want to start thinking philosophically. However, it is boring. Yet, I do like the term ""web of belief"" a lot. Unfortunately, though, they do not expound upon it much in that book."
4,Great Composers for small chn,My class and I discussed a composer each day and played a piece. We described how the music made us feel. Kids really enjoyed this and it was interesting to see how many they already recognised.
3,Not for the younger child,"This was a disappointment. I had expected it would be appropriate for a 5-7 year old (similar to ""Peter and the Wolf"" in helping child to learn different instruments.) It is far, far too advanced both in content and style. And for an older child, the format would be too ""childish."""
5,Lots of good information and a good book,"The Story of the Orchestra is an excellent book for. Adults would probably know most of the information covered in the book, but still a good read. Covers famous composers and highlights of their lives, orchestra history, instruments used in orchestras and bands. All information is true, and is a good source if you are doing any reports on instruments. Context is good and fits childrens' appetites- the Viola is the ""violin's big brother."" Good book. I highly recommend it."
3,Dead dulll,"I've been faithful to Marcia Muller for years because she is considered to have given us the first American female P.I., Sharon McCone, but truthfully, this enterprise is showing a lot of wear and tear. Unless you've read a lot of her books before, you will be bored silly by all of the people from past books who make an appearance in order to convince the reader that McCone has a rich and interesting life. The good news about this book is that it does paint a detailed and loving picture of San Francisco. This story is about current affairs, i.e., dot-coms working people literally to death, but I saw the culprit in the first 50 pages."
2,Not up to par,I just finished reading this book and it took me a month. I kept expecting it to get better but it never did. I would put it down for days before I would pick it back up. I even read another book during that time.Marcia Muller is a good author but this one just doesn't cut it.Sorry Marcia
2,How to find your purpose in life,"The book seems to be missing one critical ingredient - how does one determine his/her life's purpose. Jakes writes eloquently about the need to pursue, without reservation, the purpose for which God placed you on earth. Unfortunately, he leaves out details of the most important subject in the book. Without knowing your purpose in life, his teachings have little practical value. After all, you may take aim and hit your target 10 of 10 times, but if it's the wrong target, what have you accomplished?"
5,Maximize the moment,"This is the best xmas gift I ever received. This book will change your life. If you have heard TD Jakes preaching, you have seen his ability to excite the audience and keep them screaming. This performance is repeated in the book.It starts at such a high note. The introduction alone sends millions of questions thru your mind -past, present and future. The book keeps you evaluating your life using criterias that are supported biblically. It gives you the Bible scriptures to justfy or drive actions in your life. Read this book."
5,Excellent!!!,"TD Jakes is truely one of my favorite authors and Pastors. I first came across this book and few years ago. A very good friend started reading it, and I never got it back. So I'm so thankful to Amazon for making it avaliable to me again. It is truely a joy to read. Thankyou TD Jakes!"
5,Maximize Your Moment,I knew that this book would be a great read from the time that I was recommended to read it. The book arrived in a timely fashion and the condition was great as well.
1,Not a very good source,"When one looks for a collectors guide they are looking for an informed source. A truly good ""guide"" will show an item in it's mint, original state. This way one can tell if the item they own is in Mint, Good, or Poor condition. It is unfortunate that Ms. Eisenstein and others make excuses for the untidy and ragged condition of some of the dolls and toys in this book, and for the sorry state of the photography. It tells me that the authors did not feel that it was their job to find really great examples of things that are not that hard to find... It takes hard work and imagination for this, and I'm afraid these things are lacking."
4,Cute for rugarts and oz fans,"this game is closer to the movie than the the book. so basicaly this game is a virtual board game and it makes you go thru 4 lands munchin land,corn filled,the growed and the furrest looking for4 pices of a entry ticket to get in to merigold city once you get all these pieces you can go into merrigold city and see the wizzer of odd how will get you home but your jurneys not over yet you gotta find the wichs bromm stick to get home"
4,A good CD for a great movie !,"I loved the movie, it is pretty funny thought it is based on a very serious and preoccupying subject(unemployement). The CD has great songs, but not all of then. It is a good buy anyway."
4,The Full Monty Soundtrack,I love The Full Monty movie and the music. The soundtrack is a perfect accompaniment to exercise. It is great to listen to.
4,kinda hard NOT to bump 'n grind to this,"Whenever I have this CD playing I have to be careful that my teenagers aren't around because it embarrasses them to death to see me bumping and grinding in the kitchen while cooking their dinner. Yes, it's that kind of CD. I'm not into stripping myself but this album certainly makes me want to move. The songs are mostly all oldies from the 70s and 80s but the sort that you can listen to (and holler with) again and again (excepting The Zodiac, which really does remind you of 1960s England). I take exception to others' reviews of Tom Jones remake of ""You Can Leave Your Hat On."" I originally bought this soundtrack for that song alone and think it surpasses the original. I've seen the movie three times and play this soundtrack whenever I need a lift or am feeling slightly wild. It's a lot of fun."
3,"Good, Bad & Shame",Good - The movie and the music are great. Bad - Isn't the sountrack supposed to contain all the songs from the movie? Shame - That the wonderfull - Je T'Aime (Moi Non Plus) - Isn't on the soundtrack
3,euro-disco with sugar on it,"This is probably Erasure at one of their finest points. This CD was released at a point when the duo kept getting better and better, going from ""Sometimes"" to ""Oh L'Amour"" to ""Chains of Love"" to the radio/MTV hit ""A Little Respect"" and then this one. They were pretty big at this point and it shows in the very self-congratulating use of giant brassy synth stabs in success called ""Drama!"". It's a very fun CD, if you don't like the whole Erasure-esque esperience then you will detest every moment of this CD. It is extremely sugary. ""Sweet, Sweet Baby"" had underground appeal in 1989 with a very euro piano-house vibe, vocoder robot voice, and shrill strings. ""Paradise"" is in the Erasure mood. This is a few releases before this duo become predictable and bland and too political."
1,Stops working,"I bought this adapter thinking it would answer my problems. It did, but only for a couple of months. Just stopped working like the nintendo one did."
1,DANGEROUS!!!!!,This power adapter is DANGEROUS!!! It worked really well for a few months... then it BLEW UP!!!! I was lucky that my four year old son and I were not close to the outlet when it blew and that it was not plugged into our gamecube. But it did cause a FIRE!!! BEWARE OF THIS PRODUCT!!!! The cord burned right off of the AC adapter.DO NOT BUY THE INTEC POWER ADAPTER!!!!I have added pictures so that you can see that I am not exaggerating.
4,Excellent product,"I received this product quickly and it was in good condition. I was a bit afraid when I saw that it was a power supply for the Japanice GameCube, but the power output was almost the same 100 (JPN) vs 120 (USA) but it worked fine when I connected it.Next time please provide that type of information in your item description."
2,Stupid Intec...,"When I first bought this, it worked just fine. Then, a month or two (maybe three) I took my Gamecube to my aunts house and it wouldn't start up. I had to mess with it a little (I didn't do that before it started acting weird). When I got home, it was completely shot. I highly recommend NOT buying this! If you don't want to get another dud or a new system (a 360, Wii, or PS3), go straight to Nintendo and buy that."
5,This is what I need,I think they should put this on sell because I need it. My adapter is messed up so PLEASE PUT THIS ITEM TO SELL. I'll buy it.
1,"poorly written, hard to read aloud","I picked this book up because my son loves Bert, Elmo and Ernie. The story is fine, the pictures cute, but the text... I guess it proves the point that it is difficult to write children's books. The text is rhymed, but seems to lack any sort of meter or rhythm. It makes it very difficult to read out loud. My son seemed uninterested despite several readings, perhaps because the wording is so clunky and uninspired. I expected more from Children's Workshop."
4,Interesting,"REX is a much more melodic and appealing score than his work on PIPEDREAM and ALLEGRO which seemed to me very below-par and bland. The highlight of the score is probably ""No Song More Pleasing"", a gorgous Rodgers waltz.I would class his music for Rex on the same level as FLOWER DRUM SONG and ME & JULIET. The 1975 musical Thomas and the King explored similar territory and despite the score by Movie-Maestro John Williams- never achieved merit."
2,Even Richard Rodgers can write a turkey!,After over 50 years of superb composing a man is allowed to write a stinker and Rodgers did. We can't blame his lyricist (the great Sheldon Harnick of Fiddler on the Roof fame) or any of the creative team. Maybe we can blame the idea of writing a musical about Henry VIII beheading his wives. In any case buy this only if you're a collector (like I) or just as a curiousity.
5,Family Xmas Holiday w/Elizabeth I & Henry VIII,"If you're interested in Queen Elizabeth I of England and/or her father, King Henry VIII, you'll want to add this CD to your collection. Her mother, Ann Boleyn, has already been beheaded and her father has invited her to spend Xmas at court with his new wife and his other children. Great songs and some insight into their life and times."
4,Rockin Blues,"Don Griffin is a Chicago blues guitarist steeped in the Blues/Rock tradition of Buddy Guy and other Chicago legends. Griffin has played with, and opened for, the likes of Junior Wells, Buddy Guy, Albert King and Son Seals. His guitar playing was obviously influenced by Jimi Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughan. However, Griffin is not another SRV wanna-be. He has taken his influences added some licks in the stlyle of Johnny Winter, a liberal use of a wah-wah pedal combined them with Robin Trower like vocals and has forged his own unique sound. This particular disk has a nice mix of 6 original tunes and 3 covers. If there is a weakness in the CD, it would be Griffin's sped up version of Muddy Water's classic ""Rock Me"". Overall, a very good CD that will have strong appeal to Blues/Rockers and followers of Chicago blues."
3,"It sounded good, but not","Playing the tracks on sound bites on Amazon sounded good. Buying the CD was not so good. Don Griffin plays quite good guitar, but the singing ultimately sounds like 'I gotta to sing da blues like I mean it'. In other words, it sounds like an act rather than coming from the heart. There are plenty of up tempo tracks but they somehow miss the spot. Many tracks feel good initially but by their finish have lost their way."
4,Stacking rack,"This stacks longwise on top of Rubbermaid Slide 'N Stack Basket with Track. This was nice for me as I have a drain pipe that only allows me to utilize so much space under my kitchen sink. It is a bit narrower than necessary for my application, but works."
3,Under counter storage,Unusual in that it works as advertised and easy to install! Glides smoothly and creates order in small places. I think $20 each for a rubbermaid basket with a slide is on the high side but maybe that's just me
5,Nice Stacker,This is a really nice addition to the sliding basket. I can keep large items in the lower basket and smaller or even taller items in this one. Twice the storage space.
2,Frame's Autobiography?,"Okay, I have to confess that I haven't read past chapter three of this book. It may be a fine analysis of Van Til's thought, but to get to that you have to put up with Frame talking about himself. He is (if you believe what he writes) just about the only person who can really figure Van Til in the right way, he wrote a 125 page paper for Van Til, he wrote a negative review of Van Til's authorized biography that Van Til appreciated (he even told Frame so, so there!), Gary North talks about him in the introduction to one of his books, he was the kind of thinker that Van Til liked to challenge in class (because he was so smart, see?) etc. etc. etc. BLAH BLAH BLAH. Frame talks about himself to a ridiculous extent in this book. Helpful is the appendix where Frame briefly discusses each of Van Til's books. This is the only reason this book gets two stars. John, if I wanted to know your life story I'd ask."
4,Hyper-Kinetic!,"Not quite as cohesive or engaging as their previous release, I DON'T HAVE A FRIEND, this one is still every bit as manic and off-the-wall. Tremendous fun, with a level of production value which far exceeds most of the tired, uninspired stuff out today."
5,Personification of goodness.,"Sue Kenney personifies Goodness. She is one of those people that makes you glad to be alive. I had the distinct privilege of meeting her on Santiago de Compostela and have been thinking about her ever since. We had breakfast - twice. I've read her books, watched her videos, and am looking forward to more. She's an inspiration for sure, and a very talented, warm, and kind lady. Check out this movie to see a leader in action, and learn more about what the Camino de Santiago really represents. I recommend this movie to men and women of all ages."
2,Ladies Express Personal Feelings,The movie is of a week long walk by five ladies on the last part of the Camino de Santiago. The movie is focused around these five ladies sharing feelings and experiences of the walk.
2,A Pet Shop Boys B-Side,"Although catchy enough in its own right, this song reeks of missed opportunities. People rave about Johnny Marr being part of Electronic, but when Johnny Marr is known for being a jingle-jangle guitarist, his contributions to a bog-standard 126bpm dance track such as this could have been made by Fred the Milkman and you'd never know the difference. Similarly Bernard Sumner (of New Order) brings nothing to the track... and last, but not least, Pet Shop Boy Neil Tennant phones his vocal in, making the whole affair sound like a very shoddy Pet Shop Boys b-side. A waste of three talented individuals."
4,"Interesting blend of Marr, Sumner, Tennenet",Not exactly what I would expect when three great talents of eighties alternative/dance scene come together but it is still impressive and very danceable. Probably has survived the test of time more so than other dance hits of that era - especially some acid house etc.
5,"Sumner, Tennant, Marr- what more can you ask...","You'll be surprised what happens when these three guys combined their talent. The result is a very danceable music that just picks you up and bounces you all over the floor. The feeling and the sound is perfect. Although it only has one song with different versions (6 to be exact), each has its own unique blending and rhythm. Get this album!"
5,chi kung,"I enjoyed listening to The Healing Workout, my wife also enjoyed it very mush. would recommend everyone to buy it."
1,defective,I like the CD but it stops in the middle of the tape but I really like the movement of the exercise.
3,Eh,"I was excited to get this because of the other reviews. All the ""games"" are just any key advance games. Course that seems to be what you get for most baby games. I was looking for a little more cause in effect. Can't D bring up a dog (or various dogs) versus just advancing to the next picture?"
4,An essential book in my kitchen,"I buy the Cooking Light Annual Recipe collections religiously and each volume since 1997 occupies an easily accessible shelf in my kitchen. I still enjoy the magazine but these books are great for those nights when you want to do something different with the chicken (or whatever).After four months, I doubt this will be my most used volume. CL has gotten a bit fancier each year and I still turn to earlier volumes when I want a light version of everyday fare. What's really missing from this book (or their internet site) is a five star index. The book includes indexes for name, main ingredients and order of appearance. My wish -- an index by cuisine since I love Asian food.Bottom line: Not necessarily a book for dieters but a good resource for people seeking to eat and live in a healthy manner."
5,Excellent Work,"It is a book that helps us to think over schizophrenia. I am a counselor. I am working with several clients who are schizophrenic. It is a very useful book for psycho-education of their family. In addition, it helps the society to be more respect and patient to our client if we get rid of the medical model for schizophrenia."
3,entertaining,"This movie is entertaining.Anupam Kher was funny and did justice to his role. Kay Kay Menon has kept everyone entertained with his comic timing.The plot is simple straightforward yet entertaining. Overall, the movie was really good....SANKAT CITY is a small little gem that deserves a watch."
1,Ditto... Game won't work & THQ & web help pathetic,"Same as the others... Waste of money and major disappointment. Won't work, even with compatibility issues fixed. Can't tell if this is actually a defective game or just a bad game. Son is very disappointed and I feel like I just wasted [...] for a piece of junk. Tried to call THQ's number and was on hold for an hour and a half. Would not recommend this to anyone."
2,Fun when it works,"We also have problems getting this game to run on an XP machine. It just gives us a black screen on our machine. THQ was not helpful at all in trying to solve the problem, other than to send us an email to update our drivers (which didn't help). On a friend's XP machine it works just fine and the kids love to play it. The cars are hard to maneuver but the kids like the different arenas and secret places that unlock other arenas.I wouldn't recommend the game, based on the technical problems - we've also had problems with Velocity X, but not the older Hot Wheels games like Stunt track Drive 1 and 2."
3,Technical and Non-intuitive.,"Some authors have a gift for conveying their thoughts to the reader in simple, non-technical terms. Bill Holms, author of this book, simply isn't one of them. This book is a helpful guide for designing your own marketable firearms, but practically requires that you be well-versed in the inner workings of guns to start with. There seems to be a few holes here and there, such as the lack of information on the case extraction and ejection systems, and a good, thourough explanation is rare indeed; Holmes instead covers a huge variety of action types (bolt, autoloading, etc.) and other mechanisms, but devotes only minimal space to each.Overall, the book (which includes the plans for a 12-gauge shotgun and 10-round magazine)is a worthwhile buy to those who already have a good idea of how a gun works. Otherwise, you're better off simply sticking with books by P.A. Luty or Gerard Metral."
3,Not bad,"This is pretty good for what it is, if you are looking for how to build something illegal or trying to skate around the law this book is NOT for you. Reading this book gives some basic ideas and drawings. If you think getting this book will teach you how to go to the hardware store and build a mechine gun with a few files you are in for a shock. Most of the fire arms build in this book look kinda rough but so did the first generation of the M14 when it was first developed."
4,"Perfect for guinea pig, not for smaller animals.","This bottle is a bit pricey as far as water bottles go, but it DOES NOT DRIP. I can't even tell you how much money I've blown on ball-valve bottles that claim to be ""drip-proof"" and I still had to keep a dishtowel under it to keep from flooding my pet's cage. This bottle has never dripped or leaked. The flip-top is so easy to use, my 3 year old can fill it with no mess.On the negative side, the valve has to be cleaned on a weekly basis, which requires taking it apart and reassembling it. The valve is too rigid and tricky for a smaller pet. This is perfect for a guinea pig or rabbit, where their teeth would help, but a friend's ferret couldn't get water out of it at all. Absolutely worth it for larger ""small"" pets though."
1,Waste of money,"Bought this for my rabbit when the seal on his old bottle stopped working and leaked continuously. Gave him a couple days to figure out the valve, and he simply couldn't. Testing it with my finger, I can see that it takes quite a bit of pressure and a few seconds to get any water out of it at all, and if it's pushed the wrong way, nothing happens at all. In addition, the end of the valve is shaped like the head of a nail, only a lot smaller, and that has to be painful to push on with a soft little tongue. Although I do like being able to fill it through the nice wide opening at the top, it's useless if my poor bunny can't drink from it. I'll be going back to a ball at the end instead of this awful thing. Not sure what they were thinking when they came up with it..."
3,Is this OK?,"The content is 10/10, Mifune is great :)I am surprised that this DVD is a copy of a videotape.The DVD itself is a simple DVD+/-R (blue color) and nota ""pressed"" one.The cover is something like a zoomed bitmap w/o blurs,pixelated.It is also very unfortunate that the original Japaneseaudio is not on the disc, only an English translationis available :(So this is at least fishy and I am a bit disappointed.G"
2,Not the best for real moisture,"I use Luminary indoor tanning lotion from Designer Skin and love it. I assumed since this was an after tanning moisturizer with silicone by the same maker, it would be the same. First of all let me say that it smells good and feels lovely. However, I noticed that a few hours later, my skin does not look or feel moisturized. It looks flaky and dry. I have been tanning for about six weeks and have a great base tan. I found that my old lotion actual keeps my skin from looking dry or leathery. I'm going back to Hempz. AND this stuff was pretty expensive since I was stupid and purchased at my tanning salon. Live & learn."
2,RENT THIS GAME FIRST!!!!,"When I saw this game I thought it would be one those fun and easy fishing games, but when I played it I realized I was wrong and it was quite difficult to catch a fish. It's real easy to get one to bite but not so easy to set the hook and reel it in, the fish always seem to get away.If you are good at working the controls and have a lot of patience, this game is for you. On the other hand if your patience level is low (like mine) it's very likely you'll set the game aside and play something else.As for the quiz section-you have 10 seconds to read the questions and answer. If you know alot about fishing you'll do fine.I recommend you RENT it first."
3,Nice to see a non violent game,"This game was a good game for kids and adults alike interested in fishing. It was a nice change from all the violent and car crashing , racing games. The tournaments can go long when you are having a bad game but it is all in a game and the challenge to get the best catchis always out there. We don't have to always shoot or crash to enjoy the game. Gave a good outlook to a different sport and recreation. Many kids and adults will never have the chance to experience this kind of fishing in the real world as we are too hurried and into the rush of adreniline.We all enjoyed this game right down to the 6 year old."
1,Really Really BAD,"Why do they keep coming out with more garbage fishing games? I don't understand the complexity behind generating the great outdoors with some real nature settings and realistic fish.This game had nothing. NOTHING to offer. Bad music, sound effects, graphics, the boat was bad the tournament was boring.I rented this game and played it for 10 minutes.. that's all I could take. I kept hoping it would get better, sadly, it didn't."
3,"Fun, but It Can Get Boring","Fisherman's Bass Club is not as bad as other reviewer's have stated, but it is not for everyone. The game was given to me as a gift, as I wouldn't have bought it myself. I would only recommend the game to people who like to fish."
5,Gentle and wise book about special relationships,"This is very special book in that treats relationships with the softness and awareness that borders on brilliance. I loved most of it, it gave me a feeling of well being and of being in tune.The author is coming to Berkeley and I am looking forward to his reading. Well done."
2,An okay book,"I honestly did not see anything to rave about this book like some of the other reviews. It was ok, still too literary for me. Some sections seemed to drag on for ever! and I skipped ahead alot. Not a bad book, but I really would not recommend the author to my friends."
3,Hard to find item - found,The cost was good except having to make a minimum purchase of $25. That new amazon feature really turns me off. I've ordered elsewhere recently to avoid this new gimmick. it is sad to see Amazon stooping to such low levels. I've been a long time prime member but I can foresee that changing. Sorry for the digression. The bulb is good quality and fairly priced (Although having to make a minimum purchase pushes it out of the 5 star zone and all the way down into the 3 star zone.)
1,very poor packing; bulb arrived crushed,"This replacement sewing bulb was packed by Amazon with two books and no packaging materials (such as airpacks) to protect the bulb. as a result, the bulb arrived crushed. I attempted to obtain a replacement and Amazon informed me that only a refund was available. So, I have to return the bulb for a refund -- and go through the truoble of return shipping -- without being able to get the bulb that my wife needs for her machine without incurring new shipping costs. Crazy...."
2,Good for programmer with light experience.,"I read this book as a transition from VB to Delphiabout a year ago while still in school. I thought it was excellent at the time, but in retrospect with the experience I have gotten as a Delphi Developer since leaving school, it is NOT for very experienced programmers. If you are a student or someone with light experience in VB, this may be agood transition."
1,The wrong title for this book,"This book definitely is *not* for experienced programmers. For example the authors spend a paragraph explaining what an integer is!Furthermore, it doesn't get into the ""nuts and bolts"" at all. It is written on a very elementary level.Another annoying feature is the very frequent suggestion that the reader refer to the online reference for information on a topic. I would think that someone buys a book because he can't get the answers from the online reference. The authors also often refer you to another chapter in their book. It is as though they didn't care enough to organize their book properly.Spend your time and money elsewhere"
4,Golden indeed,"I had the pleasure of performing in the chorus of this wonderful show in the summer of '78 in a youth theatre program in Port Washington, LI, NY. This was only my third musical ever, having just played in school productions of ""Carnival"" and ""Gypsy"" as a green sophomore in high school. Somehow, our director contacted Jerome Moross to tell him of our production and he traveled to speak with us during one of our final dress rehearsals. What a thrill for a bunch of kids (albeit an unusually talented one - we had to be to pull this challenging show off!) to get to meet the actual composer of the show we were presenting! It made a tremendous impression on me and further fanned the theatrical flame that has carried me through 30 years of fun, friendships, and fulfillment in the theatre. The quality and editing of this recording is not what is should be -- but it exists, and that's reason enough to add this to your collection."
1,"More like ""Road Apple""...","I saw this show performed in Cambodia and I must say I liked it. So you could imagine my disappointment in this, the original cast recording. Frankly I expected more... a lot more. Usually the original cast is supposed to be the best. But the Cambodians put on a far better show I must say, with much more vocal range. I'd also like to know why ""Spock's Brain"" isn't on this CD? That was one piece I loved in the show I saw but for some reason it didn't seem make it onto this CD. Overall, I'd say it's a better idea to catch a plane to Cambodia and see their production than to throw your money away on this CD."
5,I really enjoy it,"I really enjoyed this book. the quality of the pictures is really great and if you prefer a book with more images than text, then this is your book..."
4,Memories of a great vacation!,"Sent to a couple who spent time in this area of France. It was a trip of a lifetime and they wanted a book to remember it all. The wines were wonderful, vineyard excursions were great and this book was a testimonial to it all."
3,"""Coffee Table Book""","This book is more of a ""coffee table"" book. It's probably my fault that I bought it without really investigating its contents. I had hoped it would give more sites to visit WITH photos."
3,can be dry...,"...But, then again, church history can be dry.It seems very popular.Originally purchased for mother-in-law for a course she took on church history 7 years ago, but I keep not filling out these evaluations. She died three years ago; I think she felt she learned a lot, but I do not remember for sure. Nor do I remember how she actually felt about its readability.Later, my wife needed the same book for a church history course. She found it difficult to read."
5,great overview of church history,"great book for study in a small group to teach church history. Not too much detail, but important, must know events and understanding. Also a quick read. good fro review of history."
2,When we bite off more than we can chew...,"Gonzalez suggests his book means to provide a rough sketch of the church's history to people completely unaware of it (really, is it possible that a person understands--even reads--words like Gnosticism but fails to grasp the basic progression?). He provides his non-textbook/detailed account from a heavily biased Roman Catholic perspective and dabbles in just as many geo-political historical facts as anything else. The book contains every possible Christianity-related character and -ism imaginable and dwells overly-long on early Catholic and medieval history and glances impassively over more recent developments. This reader can imagine only one kind of reader benefiting from the book, and that being a person who wants to collect facts to justify his/her spite of the Church and formal religion. And for crying out loud, please proofread your manuscripts before you print them!"
3,"Good summary, but where are the stories!","This book, like Bruce Shelley's _Church History In Plain Language_, is an excellent summary of church history packaged, unfortunately, in a boring format. It doesn't rate quite as well with me as Shelley's book, however. Why? Gonzalez summarizes theological developments and political events at the exclusion of any interesting and exciting stories from church history. _Christian History Made Easy_ from Rose Publishing covers the same ground while focusing on funny and moving stories from the history of the church."
3,A decent attempt...,"I used Gonzalez's ""Church History: An Essential Guide"" in a Bible Study recently, trying to study a broad overview of Christian history. The book, as the author intended, is brief and global, yet fails to spark the imagination or to challenge the reader to do further research. The bibliographies at the end of each chapter are helpful, and provide a wide spectrum of interpretation of history. Until a new global overview is published, it will suffice."
2,Do not get KINDLE edition,"Gonzalez does a fantastic job of very briefly summarizing the major events in Church History. I appreciate the content of the book itself. DO NOT BUY THE KINDLE EDITION! The kindle edition is missing key words and many spaces on nearly EVERY PAGE! The outline of the book can be grasped, but there are many sentences that are incomprehensible due to these missing items. Buy the print book if you want to read this book."
1,Where was the editor?,"Reading the previous reviews, I see that the missing editor is not the only problem but it is a huge one with the Kindle edition. I don't see how anyone could have the effrontery to actually present it for purchase. It reads like a poor first draft document. The book obviously never saw a proofreader much less an editor. I don't even believe the author himself gave it a second look. You can find hardly a paragraph without such bad grammar that you have to interpret instead of read. When I came back to this product page to post this review, I saw that the book is no longer offered to US customers. No on has offered to refund my purchase price however. The English Kindle edition is simply unreadable."
1,Terrible kindle edition,"There are not only missing and misspelled words in the kindle edition, but whole missing phrases. The overview is ok, but partway through chapter one, it becomes nearly unreadable. I had to return it and buy a print copy..."
1,Fix the Kindle Typos,"Like others, I find the Kindle version to be so filled with typos that it is very difficult to read. I don't quite understand why this has not been corrected. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE KINDLE VERSION."
1,A Good Book Poorly Edited,"The concept of the book is great, and, from what I gather from other reviews, so is the content... unfortunatly an important element of the content is missing in the Kindle edition: verbs. Many of the sentences are missing key verbs (or nouns) making their meaning unclear. This edition also has other, less harmful, editing issues, such as words ""withoutspaces"" or missing punctuation."
2,Terrible Editing,"I was excited to pick this book up for free, but soon realized why it came at such a cheap price. I have no gripes about the substance of the text aside from the fact that I have to make up my own words where it is obvious words are missing. It's almost like a mad lib. I made it through the Overview and Chapter 1 before I had to call it quits. If you're distracted by missing words or easily annoyed do not buy the Kindle edition of this book."
5,In-ear head phones (Shure),"Shure E4c-n Sound Isolating Earphones (Black)I love these headphones! They are extremely comfortable, secure (they don't fall out), and sturdy (the cables are thick enough to give me confidence that they aren't going to break anytime soon). The sound is also excellent. I have tried many headphones (in-ear)and none of them meet all of the criteria I have described here. Additionally, they are the best sound-proofing headphones that the market offers (in my opinion). They seemed a bit expensive when I ordered them, but after wearing them for a week, I believe that they are worth every penny!!!Thank you Shure!!"
4,very good headphones,"as soon as I put them on, I already could tell the difference between regular earphones and shure earphones."
3,Shure E4c-n Sound Isolating Earphones,Three stars because of the price. It would be 4 stars at half the price. This item is overpriced
1,Poor. Not nearly as good as the $25 earphones that come with the IPod,"I listen to lots of classical music and wanted some quality earphones for my new IPod. In the $200 range the Shure E4 gets top reviews. Mine were a big disappointment. I thought my first pair was defective, and Shure generously exchanged them. The replacement pair was just a bad. The E4 series has very poor base and very harsh higher frequencies. Overall, these $200 earphones are much worse than the original $25 earphones that come with the IPod. Much worse. The sound produced by the E4 is marginally better than a cell phone. If you're not serious about music, and want something fancy to plug your ears with, the Shure earphones will do the job."
1,Decent Sound but real quality problems,I have owned a pair of these for the last 2 years and have had to send them back on 3 separate occasions. Each time the elbow jack shorts out after around 6 months of usage. I take good care of these headphone and always put them back in the case. To make matters worse I left 2 messages for the manager of the repair department to discuss and he has yet to call me back. I would expect more from a >$150 a pair ear buds.
3,Great sound but unfortunate build,"I bought these for the rave reviews on the sound quality. I would agree. Note that you can not use these to work out with, because of the ""noise"" generated when the cords rub on anything (because they create such a great seal it amplifies any disturbance though the cord and directly into your ear. But unbelievably for the price, these rubber seals pop off constantly. Sometimes in your ears.The weirdest thing is, and this would have to be seen to be believed, but when these seals pop off and you put them on again - they proceed to pop off BY THEMSELVES! The rubber seal basically squeezes itself off the thin plastic shaft within seconds after you put it back on. This is very frustrating.I simply do not recommend them."
1,it is scl4,"you can buy scl4 cheaper than here. though you can think scl4 is new version of e4c, and the sound quality is similar, in fact, you can buy scl4 cheaper. the shop does not give true information about the product!!!!"
1,Low reliability,"I've had these for 4 months and now I have a short in the right earbud. It's outrageous that a pair of $170 headphones would short in 4 months, despite my careful care. I mostly just leave them at work, they hardly even travel. I thought the sound was good, though I'm no audiophile... and the ear attachments are plentiful with enough foam buds to fit any ear if you have the sense to get them in right. But to short completely like this is just absurd. Now I'll have to pay shipping to get it fixed... so angry! I'll never buy shure again, or any expensive ear buds for that matter."
3,"Good Sound, Wire Issue","Did a lot of research (and owned a pair of Shures previously) before buying these. Very happy with the fit and the sound quality, although the whole 'loop the wire over the top of the ear thing' never ever stayed in place for me. Not comfortable anyway.After five months of almost daily use I'm having to return these for repair/replacement. I think there's a wire issue by the plug that causes intermittent static, poor sound or no sound in the right ear bud. Hopefully wire fragility is not a common problem with these plugs."
2,Top notch sound quality but not durable.,"The wire that connects the audio elements became brittle when weather got cold. After two year of light use during commute, it developed what seems to be a loss wire connection in one of the buds.The factory warranty is short (two years), once out of warranty you need to pay a hefty 109 dollar for service. Shure really should give it a longer warranty coverage, given the price tag on those headphones."
2,Do Not Stay In Your Ears,"When these headphones sit properly in your ears (they need to be pressed into the ear), they sound awesome. My problem is I can't get them to stay where I put them. I have tried all the cups provided, but I commute on a bus and any small bump will shift the earphones resulting in inferior sound. I would not recommend them for this reason. The comfort factor is also a consideration. You really need to get used to having an object pressed into your ear."
3,"Good, but not outstanding","My main comment with these earphones is that, when I compare them against Bang & Olufsen or Sennheiser equivalent earphones, they underperform in bass delivery. It is somewhat weak, and has not improved after many hours of use. Reproduction of the rest of the frequency range, is very good. Sound isolation is also quite good."
3,Great Sound But Uncomfortable,"The Shure E4c-n's sound great and really do isolate well once you get a tight fit. But for me the earphones were uncomfortable. I ended up returning them. Amazon's vendor-partner, TechDepot, took them back with no questions asked and promptly issued a credit to my credit card account. Kudos to TechDepot...Excellent after-sales care!!!!"
5,THE BEST EARPHONE EVER!!!!,I am a professional classical musician. I have never felt music like this... these pair of headphone are the best I have seen in my life. Definition is just amazing... I'm speechless.
3,Solid Phones,"I recently bought these headphones used, and I have to admit that I was a little disappointed. My brother bought some E5s and I tried those out, and was amazed thoroughly. When I put in the E5s, I couldn't hear people talking to me at all. One of my main reasons for these headphones is to deaden outside noise. However, the E4s I got are horrible in comparison. I might need to get a better fitting earpiece or something... Or maybe since they're used they aren't soundproof anymore. Don't get me wrong, the sound is still great, but there is all the outside noise to combine it with."
1,bait and switch,"I was looking forward to getting the E4C earphones and I eagerly paid my money to Amazon's shill, Ace Photo & Digital. What I got was a pair of SCL4earphones which are not E4C's and a return policy that doesn't take earphones on return. The SCL4 earphones sell for [...] cheaper and can be easily picked up new in the box on Ebay for [...] whereas I paid Ace Photo and Digital [...] for a pair of SCL4's. I can see why they shipped by UPS rather the USPS, they wanted to avoid mail fraud. I would not recommend buying these E4C's because they are not what you will get."
3,Incompletely lovely,"I've owned and cherished this book for a long time and came to Amazon to find a replacement since my copy was ruined in a ""flood."" As stated by others before me, this book is beautifully illustrated and definitely inspiring; however, some of the lovely breads featured in the photos do NOT include a corresponding recipe, and some of the recipes either were not tested and/or were not edited for accuracy. I'm going to replace my ruined copy just the same because this is, indeed, a beautiful book."
2,Warning: Over-powering smell! Leaves marks!,"This product simply has a far too over-powering of a smell.It also leaves marks on clothing.Maybe I need to dilute it and/or spray less, but this product is not working for me as I expected.I had tried the ""mint & refresh"" version of the product, which I greatly liked. However, this version feels as if I had perfumed myself with some dish washing soap.The sad thing is... I bought a whole 10-pack case of it! :("
5,a must have...,I am learning so much from this book. Tons of great information. This is a keeper.Two thumbs up.r
5,Awesome book on Wine,This is more than a 101 on Wine. Anyone would enjoy this book. This may be a Christmas gift for several friends who also enjoy wine.
5,A simple way to learn about wines,"As the title indicates, Andrea Immer makes wine very simple to understand. Instead of being an encylocpedic reference manual on wine producing regions & other esoterica, she breaks down winetasting into the following simple components and describes them: full body vs. light body, dry vs. sweet, crisp vs. low-acid, oaky vs. no oak, high tannin, vs. low tannin. To help the reader better understand them, she employs the techinique she uses to train the waiters at the restaurants she's worked at - she has them taste. Therefore, you are going to be buying and tasting multiple flights of wines. This may be a plus or minus depending on your point of view.While the tasting flights are the most useful, she does also provide simple short-cuts to help you determine the character of wine based on characteristics like color and alcohol content and includes a primer on cracking the ""code words"" that appear on wine labels."
1,Charts & Maps Not Legible on Kindle,"My gripe with the book is not so much with the author, as it is with Amazon and publishers who sell a book as Kindle friendly when it is not. Charts and maps are so tiny that not even a magnifying glass makes them legible. Zooming in does no good. Any references in the text to the chart or map become meaningless. This leaves the reader in frustration and with a bad taste. If great wine can be made simple, why not the 'e' edition of a book?"
3,"Good, but not the best","The clipper was good for the price, but there were still minor problems with the clipper. When the clipper is put to the shortest setting, the clipper will cut hair pretty well as the motor is fast. On the longest setting, the clipper's motor will practically stop and not cut hair at all. Basically, I used the clipper on it's shortest setting and have relatively no problems. It does the job and I bought it for cheap. The DVD that comes with it is garbage and doesn't tell anything about cutting hair except how to ruin it. It's that bad. If you want a cheap, but good pair of clippers to save money, this will do the job. It you want a fast motor and perfectly clean cut, pay some more."
5,Andis personal haircutting kit,"This is one of the best bargains on the Amazon site. Andis is of the very highest quality for the money. The kit has everything you would possibly need for hair cutting or trimming, plus some. Every piece--the electric hair cutter/trimmer, the scissors, the hair size adapters, the brush, the cape, etc., are all of excellent quality. Most importantly, the unit has the power to do the job. It even comes with a ""how to"" video."
2,"Nice features, but it gets too hot.","The assortment of attachments (including a 1"" comb attachment) and extra long cord are nice features of these clippers; however, they got very hot in just a few minutes' time. The clippers were hot enough to burn skin before I could complete my son's haircut. Same thing happened when I cut my husband's hair several hours later after the clippers had cooled off. I returned these clippers to Amazon and bought a different brand."
5,Andis Promotor,I just had my first hair cut using this clipper yesterday. The blade is sharp and the motor is powerful. It doesn't pull my hair and cut very smoothly. Make sure you apply the oil that comes in the kit on the blade before you cut the hair. No problem on the clipper so far. Very happy with the product.
2,Doesn't worth a buck,"I suppose Dollar stores ship this toy. It should cost accordingly then. Falling apart right out of the box. Fun idea, but doesn't worth the price paid."
2,not very well made,I bought these rockets for my 4 year old son. He had a hard time making them work but everyone else could use them easily. The stickers were falling apart when i opened the package - I put them back on a few times before discarding the stickers. These rockets flew ok for inside use. After a few days use the glue was coming off and they started falling apart. They were just cheaply made which is reflected in the price.
3,An Important Aircraft Type but Little Information,"I have been studying float aircraft and bush planes for a few years. The Curtiss HS-2L is the first bush plane used in Alaska and Canada yet little to no information is available. Over 1250 aircraft were constructed yet only one remains today. That aircraft was restored by Canada after being sunk for over 50 years. The book gives a very curseary review of the aircraft with little of its development,capabilities, specifications, etc. It does discuss the salvage and restoration of the only aircraft. If you are desiring to read about the development and specs of this aircraft similiar to books that have been written on the Beaver, you will be disappointed. I ranked this book as a three only becuase no other books have been written on this aircraft that I am aware."
5,A must read classic.,"The poetry in this book is beautiful, you can feel the devotion in every word. It is a must have for any devotee of Ma Kali."
3,A Disappointment,"Led by veteran Gil Grissom, the remarkable team assigned to the Bureau's graveyard shift - including Catherine Willows, Warrick Brown, Nick Stokes, and Sara Sidle - must combine cutting-edge scientific methods and old-fashioned savvy as they work to untangle the evidence behind the yellow police tape. While Nick and Catherine investigate a newly discovered fifteen-year-old murder, Grissom and the rest of the team must uncover the indentity of a cold-blooded killer -- one whose execution-style, ""double-tap"" signature has provoked the interest of FBI agent Rick Culpepper. I'm a big fan of the television series CSI and I thought that reading the book would be just as great. Wrong. It's like watching a movie then reading the book. I recommend sticking to the television show."
4,Great CD Great Live,"I recently purchased Jack Clayton's new CD and it was great, I can't stop playing it. The only thing better than cruising around town listening to it was seeing him perform live. he's one of the few performers I've seen that may actually be better live than on his recordings..."
2,Very strong smelling,"I was looking for a lotion that was thick and had a pleasant smell. After reading reviews, I went with this lotion. The smell is very strong and not pleasant to me. It makes me sneeze! The lotion is thick, but I can't use it because the smell is way too strong. My nose is not overly sensitive and I use lots of other scented lotions without any problems."
5,Love the smell,The smell of the lotion calms your body. I use it after the shower and right before bedtime. I've always been a fan of Aveeno lotions. I think it's the oat. It really moisturizes. You can feel it the moment you put it in your hands. I've been looking for a lavender smell. Johnson and Johnson has one as well but I feel this lotion works better.
5,best lotion,I get really bad dry skin after i wash my hands and i have tryed alot of different lotions until i tryed this one it seams to work the best and last the longest and its only around 10 bucks in the store when I've tryed ones around 20 and i would have 5o keep putting it one and one i highly recommend this lotion to any one 10 stars
5,A pretty darned good musical,"I was one of the relatively few who attended a performance during its very short run on Broadway. I loved the show...especially the score.A few days ago, I picked up an LP of the Original Broadway Cast recording. I hadn't heard the thing since my having seen it on stage more than twenty-five years ago.I was delighted to find that the score was/is as wonderful as I had remembered it to be.As I recall from the performance I attended, the book is a bit wanting.But Grey and Reinking were wonderful. They just about made the whole thing work.This is a musical which should be given another go on stage. But since that's very unlikely; the best we can do is to hear the Original Cast recording on LP or (even better) on CD."
3,Joan of Arc - the Musical,What a sorry subject for a musical comedy.They almost pulled it off - if you don't mind hearing King Charles singing that he justs want to be called Goodtime Charley or the singing and dancing as Joan burns at the stake.Actually the score is quite good and the performers are excellent. If you're a collector it's worth getting but this is one one show that is better on the CD than the stage!
5,Perfect for My Leica,"I have used a backpack-style camera bag for years, and there will be plenty of photography outings when it will be the bag of choice, especially for my larger camera, a Canon 1Ds Mark II; however, I wanted something smaller and less noticeable for those occasions when I am out on the street with a smaller camera, and this bag is perfect for that. I can pack it with my Leica M9 - on its back with the mounted lens facing up - and a couple of spare lenses and accessories, and still have room for a few other small items. Although the padding is thinner than that of the backpack, it is sufficient for the way I use it, which is more like I would use a briefcase than a camera case. I have no doubt that this bag will last many years, and like a good wine, will only get better with age. This is one purchase that you will not regret the next morning."
4,Great bag,"This is a great bag for daily use. I can fit a Canon 5D with a 24-70 2.8 attached plus a speedlight and accessories - no problem. It is well built, as I have come to expect from Domke and best of all it does not scream ""CAMERA BAG""."
2,Should have been better for the price,"Pros:Nice waxwear finishHad just the right amount of pocketsInside of strap has rubberized grip stripsMight be just about right size for a stealth, take anywhere camera bagCons:The bag itself contains no paddingThe only padding comes from what seems like a ""Domke 720-200 FA-280 1 Small Compartment Insert (Green)"" that might be big enough for Pen type cameras but not SLRs. Maybe with the ""Domke 720-230 FA-230 3 Compartment Insert"" a decent SLR with lens would fit but thats another $30 bucks.Loops that attach the strap to the bag and for strap length adjustment are plastic, seems cheap and unauthentic for the style and price.Metal hook clip lid closure seems clunky (maybe with time, opening this would seem natural)but authentic.I'm returning this bag on my dime."
1,worst purchase,"You can fit a couple lenses and a camera body and a few accessories in it. That is fine. But the material is stiff and unyielding. Putting things in and taking things out of this bag is a nightmare. The pockets are small, as they should be for a bag that is low profile and compact. But when I reach my fingers in the pockets to retrieve items the zippers scratch up my hands. I have small hands and simply taking out something as small as a rear lens cap is a big headache. I cannot stress how much I hate this bag. I never use it. It is good for transporting your stuff if you don't want a bulky bag to carry around. But I don't recommend it for using on a shoot because you will be fighting with it for your stuff the whole time."
2,The Waxwear finish is not for everyone,"While this bag looks great in terms of color, I hated the Waxwear finish. It rubs off on your hands when you touch it and also when you put something in the back slot such as a book or folder, the wax rubs on that. And if you put something that is rubber there, it will ruin that. I put my Apple iPad there with the Apple iPad case, which is black rubber and the wax rubbed against that and ruined it for good.The inside of the bag does not have the Waxwear finish so you don't have to worry about your equipment there however all of the pockets do have the wax and it can indeed rub off on whatever you place there.I returned this bag and got a standard canvas one of the same model and am much happier with that."
2,Disappointing,"I was really disappointed with this author. I love horror above all other genres and I really expected something better based on the first paragraph of ""Ordinary Horror"". I'm only rating this book 2 stars because at least Searcy knows how to use the English language. But he was overly descriptive at some points, and quite often for no reason. Searcy did at least keep up the feeling of dread throughout much of the book, but that just made it all the more disappointing when nothing happened. I keep thinking that maybe I missed something - all I can think is that the plants somehow drove everyone crazy and that's supposed to be the horrorific bit of it?"
3,eh,"I liked the idea, but overall, this book is very boring. The author needs a better editor--it REALLY drags."
1,"Oh, the horror...","I couldn't help but think of Roman Polanski's film ""Repulsion"" while suffering through this meandering mess of a book. Yet where Polanski's film succeeds in portraying a woman's descent into madness, this book fails. This is one seriously tiring tome."
2,"So Ordinary, It's Horrible...","At about page 150 of this 230-page ""horror"" novel, I began to wonder if I was the victim of some terrible joke played by the author and publishing company, namely, that nothing horrible was going to happen. Oh, wait. At one point, the protagonist locks his keys inside his car.That's about as close to horror as this book comes. Clearly, a number of people who have already reviewed the it enjoy the writing style. I didn't. Paragraph after paragraph of descriptive prose, each between half a page to two pages in length, pushed the limits of my patience. And the almost total lack of dialogue or action didn't help, either.I wish the book had contained an actual horror story to support all the verbiage. As it stands, this feels like a 50-page short story, padded out to the length of a novel."
1,LIKE WATCHING BLOOD DRY,"I rarely write reviews of anything, but it's only right someone warn the uninitiated about this god awful thing.""Ordinary Horror"" is bad on many levels. ""Professor"" Searcy reminds me of a failed writing professor trying too hard to impress. I'll spare you the details (something I wish he would have done) and tell you this is the most confounding, unexciting, poorly written novel I've read in years. Beware, alright.(Note: The title evokes the remarkably good ""Ordinary People"" from back in the 70's. This book isn't even in the same league.)"
1,HORROR? NO...HORRIBLE,"MAYBE IT'LL MAKE A GOOD MOVIE. IT SURE DOESN'T MAKE FOR A GOOD READ. H.P. LOVECRAFT, THIS GUY AIN'T."
2,Going nowhere,"I started this short book with high hopes as I'd read some glowing reviews of it. The first few pages were well-written and promised an eerie story that would creep up on the reader. However, by the time I got a third of the way through the book I became increasingly aggravated with the obliqueness, lack of affect of the protagonist, and minimal plot. Halfway through I just wanted to skip to the end and find out if ANYTHING happened. Basically, Ordinary Horror would have made a pretty good short story but is an extraordinarily dull novel."
2,where did the plot go?,"i agree with the prior reviewers that the story starts with promise. an elderly widower orders a strange plant to help rid his garden of gophers, and what starts as a promising story of the strange effect of these plants on the neighborhood (or is it all in his mind?)soon turns into a story full of the beginnings of menace and horror which NEVER pay off. i kept waiting for something happen and nothing ever did. save your money....my copy of this book ended up in a trashcan @ the airport."
1,What's the point!!!,"I am a stubborn reader...if I buy the book I am going to finish it. Half way through this book I'm still reading about household sounds, descriptions of heaven knows what. What is the point of this book? The worse book I have ever tried to finish."
1,BORING,"... The horror of this book is how incredibly boring it is. But maybe that's the point.....This is a small book - just over 200 pages - but it took me nearly 10 days to read it - and I kept re-reading sections to make sure I hadn't missed something really devastating. I do not recommend this book - although the writing is probably very good. I don't read books for the writing, but for entertainment value - and believe me - there is nothing entertaining about this book."
1,Don't bother.,"Having read rave reviews of this debut novel, I was eager to dig in. What a disappointment. I'm embarrassed to say I read the entire thing simply hoping to see if something interesting would happen or if the vague imagery would actually take me somewhere. I am a huge fan of Shirley Jackson and Raymond Carver - two authors to whom Searcy is compared - and the comparison is an insult. Searcy's blurry mess of suburban snapshots is horrifying only in the sense of how unsatisfying and pointless it is."
1,Just plain bad,"Take a look at the reviews for this one. All of them.Those that are good are most involve necessity, and a willingness to accept subpar quality.This is not a good product -- maybe worth $50, but not more. The resolution is nothing short of horrible. The sound is fine, especially through the headphone jack, but i could not distinguish the walls from the floor when i tested this with Morrowind. I am not just talking about details here, i am talking about major graphical display haze and fuzz.Really, you are betting off buying a small TV monitor. The sound may not be as good, but at least you can see the game.Caveat emptor! (let the buyer beware, especially if you can't return it)"
1,MAJOR letdown,"Bought this as soon as I heard it was out. Figured that an lcd screen combined with an XBOX would be awesome...... how wrong I was!!! DVD movies look decent, but ANY games look grainy, and the person that said the Gameboy Advance SP's screen looked better is 100% right. I don't know how Intec's PS2 lcd screen looks, but if it is anything like this one then I advise everyone to stay away from that one too."
2,No Warranty - Poor Support - Buy a TV,"What a great concept - to bad this company cares more about profit than product quality. I have owned ours for less than 116 days - and within that period it just DIED! That's less than 4 months and a $169.99 product dies... no lights, no warning - just dead.The saddest part is that they carry absolutely no warranty! Nobody would buy a product in this day and age without a warranty - I mean, you have to figure when you open the box they'll be warranty information - nope! It's like pulling teeth!Buy a good Portable DVD with input for the XBox - or anything else external. Don't get suckered in by the cheap price - you definately get less than what you paid for!Run!!!"
1,Don't waist your money,The Mobile Monitor is terrible. The picture on the box shows it to be a wide screen speaker-to-speaker picture. In fact every picture throughout the documentation is the same. In reality is a very small 5.4 inch diagonal square with black plastic taking up the rest of the space. The LCD display is better on my son's gameboy advanced. This text in most games is unreadable and you get a ghost behind anything that moves. Don't waist your money.
1,Save your money,"This thing is complete garbage. Color is horrid, grainy, and all around full of suck. The sound is great though."
3,XBox Mobile Monitor,"The monitor is small to say the least, and hard to see in bright light, the outside package was completely destroyed lucky for me the hard plastic bubble pack around the screen was intact. Overall I was not happy with the screen or with the condition of the delivered package.Save your money I don't recommend buying the screen."
1,Sorry for the trouble,"So, here is a tiny screen, for big $$$, that we ALL need. Right?Wrong !!!. Have you tried setting a XBox on your lap. A real thrill... Where are we supposed to put this thing so we can see it while we are playing it in the car. Ceiling, floor, another seat. I cannot understand how it could be used. Another bad concept."
5,rocking cool!,Man this thing is really the BOOM.If you don't get this your sick .The best thing about it is when you don't have a t.v. in you room just kick back and play it on the xbox. No little sister saying ''I want to watch little LULU.
2,"good idea, piece of junk","i know, this is a great idea, really, but for the size of the whole thing, only 5.6"" is used, and it's really expensive. With the money you could use to buy this, you could get a 13"" TV with a built-in VCR. And the issue of playing in the car: if playing in the car is really that important to you, just get one of the car TV's, but it troubles me to think that our society is so revolved around electronics that we can't even have a meaningful discussion in a car and that we have to play video games we already get enough of at home in a car. I mean, come on!"
