1,Stone Angel,It was a dull and boring book that put me asleep while reading what was thought to be the most interesting parts of the book.
3,"3 stars for talent, 2 missing for the story itself.","I'm a grade twelve honour student in Ontario who just finished reading this book. I believe that there are many issues that Laurence could have probed deeper instead of filling her book with symbols. The religious rooting of the book is not well solidified in the writting, nor is Hagar's relationship with her femininity. I believe had the extravagance of the two been incorporated in the book, many may have been more willing to relate to the plot. Everyones life contains SOME idea of love and that is almost COMPLETELY absent in this book. Hagar is stone, but there is NO angel present at all whatsoever. What is an angel with out love??? What is a book without love???"
3,"This Book is captivating, yet confusing.","The Stone Angel, isn't an overly bad book, just confusing, at first I found it very difficult to read. I too must read this book for an english class, since my teacher adores this book. At first it is confusing while she has her flashbacks and everything, but after awhile you get into it and it seems easier to comprehend."
4,I liked this book but it needed a bit more of a plot.,"I liked this book but it needed a little bot of a lot and climax. This book was a book that I wouldn't pick up to read in my leisure but i had to read for my OAC English class. All in all this book was alright and even though i wanted to hate this book I kindda enjoyed, It's a story about an old woman and how she struggles to regain her freedom as a woman and live a life that didn't include a son that she didn't love and hasn't loved since the day he was born. She is always remembering the times that she had with hert second son that died quite a long time and she learns that she cannot hang on to the past but must move forward in order to rest in peace when the time comes and to be happy with herself."
1,WORST BOOK of ALL TIME,"FIRST I give this book 0 stars. I had to read this ""book"" for my english, and i mean this is far the worst thing i have ever encountered in my life. This book is not just boring, it is also very negative. My advise to anyone that is about to read this book is, read the coles notes."
3,It wasn't that bad,"This book I must say was pretty boring at the beginning. But as you read further on, it gets more interesting. One flaw is that it gets a little confusing, when Hagar is 90 and then the flashbacks."
1,A good old Canadian novel,The only thing true about that statement was the Canadian part. This book was one of the worst books I have ever read. I had to read it for OAC English and it ranks right up there with The Grapes of Wrath. I recommend reading the Coles notes if you have to read this book!
5,A beautiful book,"An unusual and insightful view of one's own life in retrospect, highlighting the frustration that a previously vivacious person feels when surrounded by old age. Perhaps more suitable for personal reading or study than prescribed school work,this is not always a comfortable read but is ultimately a rewarding one."
2,"Dour, very dour","I was required to read this book for a high school assignment and found it to be laborious read. I found Hagar's character to be so bitter, angry, and grouchy that it just put a damper on the whole thing. She (as well as the other characters) is well fleshed out and that just makes things worse.There are several things you can pull out of this book but the most obvious one is the classic example of a person who is so proud and stubborn that s/he is unable to accept love or give of it. That's the character of Hagar and like her, this is a novel you'll want to avoid because it's a very dour thing to contend with.Darkhorse86"
2,If only there was a God.,"Everything about Hagar Shipley is repugnant. From rathervisceral descriptions of huiman ugliness, I could find some literaryvalue. It's a technically solid book, but quite honestly, it's -boring.-Authors should feel in some way compelled to be telling a story. One of those simple mysteries, it seems. It seems a rather fitting sequel to W.O. Mitchell's who has seen the wind, and in fact I see a lot of sharp parallels. Unlikable narrator (though little Brian is simply incipid, while Hagar manages to be thouroughly horrid), dawdling, Seinfeldian plot that isn't really a plot at all, and a vcery frank account of praire life.I find myself wishing Bampton would just smack this woman. She's foolish, pretentious, pitiful and downright -stupid- at times. I derrived sick pleasure from her fall at the begining of the book."
1,A book that leaves nothing to the imagination,"The Stone Angel by Margaret Lawrence is a novel that doesn't leave much to the imagination. Hagar Shipley describes everything from a fart to being undressed in incredible detail...so much that the reader doesn't really need to know.It is also a novel where Hagar tries to give advice to other people without taking it herself. She is full of pride, so much so that she dies while fighting over a glass of water with her daughter. It is a sad book, but not emotionally sad. It is pathetic that Hagar can't accept the fact that people will be people, and there's nothing that she can do about it."
1,One of the reasons that people do not read more.,This book was shear torture. Who wants to read a book about a depressing girl growing up in one of the most boring parts of the world? No one.
2,Male - No. Female - Yes.,"I've recently finished reading the Stone Angel(Or The Stoned Angel according to my class.). The story was written excellently but there was a weak plot. I personally found the story dull, and it helped put me to sleep at night. On the other hand, Every single Female in the class loved the book, while every single male hated it. The women said that they could get in touch with Hagar and they could understand what she's going through. The males couldn't understand it, This book can be considered 'The Chick Flick' of literature. So, If you're a female, I recommend this book, but if you are a male, I will have to say that you shouldn't get it."
1,No one should be forced to read this book,As a high school student I was forced to read this book. I do not recomend this book because it jumps back and forth between Hagar the 90 year old and Hagar the girl and woman. Further more it is difficult to stay focused on the book because it seems like a meaningless life story.
3,Good condition but......,"The book was in relativly good condition for a used book, with minimal damage to the spine and the pages. The delivery took a bit longer then I would have liked but, was within the delivery estimate. There was some writing and highlighting in the book, very little, but I don't actually remember if that was in the description or not. Overall I was okay with it."
4,Great character,"Hagar Shipley is 90 years old. She's a little senile but still as strong-willed as ever. Her son and daughter-in-law can no longer take care of her and decide to put her in a nursing home. She, of course, will have none of that -- she runs away! As she journeys through the final days of her life, Hagar takes us on a journey of years past as she recollects and takes stock of the life she's led. She's a great character, manipulative and proud, sweet one moment, a holy terror the next. Laurence brings her to life with great skill, allowing the reader to see past her obvious character flaws and come to understand her more than she ultimately understands herself. This is the first book of Laurence's I've read. I'll definitely read more."
4,A vibrant story - full of life and death,"We are introduced to Will Parker, boy from Idaho, as he journeys to the Wolf Swamp (Manhattan) in search of a lost love.During the course of the novel, he learns that it is his task, metaphorically speaking, to ""Slay the monster, and rescue the maiden."" I like the uncertainty at the end of the book whether he has been able to accomplish either of those goals, because it makes the point that reality isn't as neat as the stories we tell about it. We can create the stories, but the reality itself is more chaotic and never fully explainable.On another level, the book is easy to understand. Boy moves to city, boy finds self and falls in love, boy's friends get AIDS and die. Although this plot line is somewhat of a cliche, and truly heartbreaking, the vivid characterizations and passions of the characters in their life make it a book about living rather than about dying.This is one you'll ponder for a long time."
2,Writing style is horrible.,This book is barely readable. It have a lot of run on sentences. The style of writing distracts the reader from the story line. I can't get into the book at all.
3,Decent step stool,"While the quality is not fantastic, it's decent. My 4yr was very excited to receive it. She loves it! It serves its purpose. The color of the carriage is not as sharp as the picture shows. It's kinda faded pink. Putting it together took about 30 minutes. One of the bolt hole was too small for the bolt so we had to find a hammer to really force it in. Other than that, all was well."
5,Lovely,This album featurs six lovely songs. I highly reccomend you but it and listen to it. It will surely put a smile on your face :D...
3,you get what you pay for,I bought 3 and the zipper has already failed on one. The zipper has a hard time going over the corners. Better to zip each end up to the top than one end all the way around.
2,case ok,"This case is ok. I bought 2 and one came with the zipper not working properly. Also, the case isn't as big as I thought it would be. The camera fits in it but it is a tight fit. I was hoping it would be easier to get the camera in and out but its not the case. It's not bad but it's not a great."
5,great little case,This case is sturdy and perfect for my Kodal camera eventhough it was made for a different camera. The cleaning cloth is very handy too.
3,Cute but big,"The case is cute but very wide for the latest canon cameras (SD800, SD870 etc)Also the material is kind of cheap (but you get what you pay I guess)It is more of a case to store while transportation, rather than a case to carry around"
2,It was too big....,"this camera case is too big for my camera.i have a CANON SD 500, and this case is too big for the camera."
3,too large,I have a Canon SD600 and I felt this case was just too big for this very compact camera. There's about an extra inch of length and width inside the case.
4,Cute and compact,"I like this case because it is attractive, compact, and sturdy (it is a nylon-covered firm case). The variety of colors also makes it less likely that you will mix up your camera case with everyone else's at the family reunion! The only drawback is that small items, like extra SD disks or batteries, can easily fall out when you unzip the case--there is not a pocket inside that holds them securely in place."
3,"a nice case, but too big for SD750","This is a pretty nice case, but it is really too big for the Canon SD750."
5,camera case,"This is a great camera case. It is small yet protective. I especially like the hook on it to attach it to my clothes, purse,backpack, etc. I also like the colors selections. It is a great product. I bought one and bought another for my husband."
4,Fairly tough camera case,"Executive Summary: Good, sturdy camera case to protect camera from falls when camera is inside the case.Details:I bought this for the camera we use at work. Since we are taking kids on tours and holding events, we wanted something sturdy. This works.There is a pocket on the inside to hold a battery and another card. The camera is strapped in by a velcro strap. The case isn't that big, but it's bigger than the leather cases I have seen. The material is medium hard, kind of like a harder than a stiff neoprene computer sleeve, but not as hard as metal. If you threw it in a backpack, it would be fine.The little carabiner seems useful too."
4,Nice,I bought this for my sister to take on her trip. It is a perfect fit for her Canon SD750. The bright color helps locate it easily. Overall she is very happy with the product.
2,Too big,The case was too big for my Canon Powershot SD1000 camera. Inside has too much space for the camera. I do not feel safe with the camera having so much space inside for it to move around. Inside does not have much cushioning.
1,Not what I ordered !,I ordered a red nylon camera case to go with the camera I bought as a graduation gift. The case that was shipped to me was bright orange !! not even close to being called a red. I was disappointed but didn't have time to return the case for another one before graduation.
3,Good points and bad points,"The case is compact, sturdy, and lightweight, and the carabiner is a great way to carry it hooked to my belt. Depending on how you use the case, though, there can be a problem. My previous camera case was soft-sided, but it held everything upright, so battery and memory cards didn't fall out, even when the case was unzipped. I am trying to retrain myself to always zip this case closed when it's not in use, because I've already had a close call with things falling out. For me, the other design works better."
2,a little disappointing,"I was disappointed by the cheap quality of this product. One of the velcro straps was already coming apart at the seams when I opened it, and it just appears to be made cheaply (the zipper and caribener, for instance). The camera fits nicely in there, and it does the trick, I just would rather have been able to compare it firsthand with other products before making the purchase. If I had done so, I would have chosen something at Target or BestBuy over this product."
3,Bigger than it looks....,"This camera case delivers on all the things it promises: Hard shell to protect the camera, velcro strap, inside pocket, and a carabiner, all convenient thing to have. But it is advertised as fitting the Canon Elph SD 1000, and it really does not. There is a ton of extra room so the camera slides up and down against the case even when it is in the pocket or velcro. The bulkiness of the case kind of defeats the purpose of having a small, compact camera. Does the job though, my camera is still in great condition1"
5,Canon Powershot Camera Case,No one even knows its a camera case. Every time someone sees it they think its a make-up bag! It definitely helps protect my camera well!
3,The handles make it not a Classic,I love my Anolon Classic cookware and have accumulated about 30 pieces including 4 qt. and 10 qt. Dutch ovens. I prefer the Classic series because of the material used for the handles. This item has metal handles like the Professional cookware although the pictures on the side of the box show the Classic resin handles. I haven't used this and might send it back. I would for sure if I could exchange it for the 5.5 qt. 'true' Classic at a comparable price but for some unknown reason it costs three times as much.
3,rare material but not international enough,"Audio material like this cassette can be a great asset when teaching ""English as an international language."" Unfortunately, there is not much audio material around so this cassette will probably be the best you can get.However, for a casette dealing with INTERNATIONAL English the recordings focus too much on inner cirlce varieties. There is no sample from Nigerian English, for instance. It would also been interesting to have samples from some non-native speakers from Europe or Asia.Also, the speakers only repeat the sample text. While this enables one to distinguish features of the variety in question quite clearly, it also tends to become quite dull. Additionally to the sample-text some other speech samples (like jokes, for instance) would lighten things up a bit."
3,Very limited Cinderella playset,"This is a paperdoll book, without clothes. My daughter has had fun with this set, but it is too limited. Apparently ""Shall We Dance"" takes place ONLY at the ball. The characters included are Cinderella, the Prince, both Stepsisters, a coach and 4 court musicians.Where's the Stepmother, Fairy Godmother, Jaq, Gus, Lucifer, etc? They would make this a true Cinderella playset, which is what I expected."
2,Super Nice!!,"Do you need a electric frying pan??? Buy this one. It's smooth, even heat puts others I've owned to shame. Nice finish and built like a tank. Excellent!"
1,Promises not realized,Been using for one month now and the results are the same. Do not see any positive results using this product that promised much but no help. Trying something else now.
1,"300mg CAPSULES, ONLY! DECEPTIVE marketing...","The capsules smell strange, and when I see what the powder looks like inside the clear capsules, it's tiny flicks of orange in a mostly white powder substance.More importantly, since these pills are NOT cheap, it is advertised as if each capsule IS the 600mg dose, where as in fact, you need 2 capsules to get the 600mg, so there's actually 50 servings. Very deceiving!Haven't noticed any change for this past few weeks, and will not order again."
2,Korean Ginseng,"This is not pure Ginseng. Pure Korean Ginseng is not cut with rice powder, and who knows what else. Not the real thing."
5,Doctor Recommended,Recommended by my physician for blood sugar control. Felt much better within a few days of taking it/.
2,No energy explosion but it's ok.,It's ok... use with other products it help with the neccessary engery that I need to get through the work day.
1,And still more snake oil,"I havne't yet found any supplement that does anything for energy, stamina, or libido. Obviously too many of us keep buying this stuff hoping to find the one that works but this is another that doesn't."
2,Needs better firmware and intergration with windows,"I got this device at a really good price of $115.The storage unit works fine if it is attached to the computer but if you want to really use it as NAS, look for another product.I have been trying to set this up with my windows network and I am able to connect at times and most of the time it would say storage not found, even though I can ping the device.Another caveat is if you try to use it as a print server, and printer is off, Windows will try to check for the printer and if its not found, programs like Word keep crashing, this happened to me several times, I just don't use it as a print server anymore."
2,Never good time with foam tan,I have yet to try a foam tanner that spreads well. This left me streaky and was hard to spread because it dried so fast. I now use it on my face only. It was hard to get even on hands and feet without building up orange areas on knuckles and toes. It did give me the same orange tint as most self-tanners I have tried. Not worth the price tag when I get better results from L'Oreal Sublime Bronze.
3,Pretty Okay,"After having read this book, I have to say that I wasn't terribly impressed--nor was I seriously let down. There are plenty of great pieces of hard to find information about Irish Druids--I mean, lets face it. These days you have to really look hard to find your way out of all the wishy-washy fairy-tales concerning Druids and Celtic religion--especially on the internet, where almost everyone seems to be in costume. I also appriciated the mention of other Celtic tribes throughout Europe.What I didn't care for was the repeated and tiresome disdain towards the ""so-called Druids"" of Britain. When I'm reading for information/enlightenment, it's difficult to feel that I'm getting it from a credible source when the author's writing seems so biased and disdainful towards the non-Irish Druids. Yes, I know that the book is written with Ireland in mind, but the author just seemed to keep making digs at the other country while elevating Irish Druids over the rest. Kind of annoying, but not terrible."
3,DS fun.,"Yes, I sold my copy but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy this game because I did! The characters were all different and colorful. The story wasn't too bad and the different planets were cool.Don't think this game was a piece of cake though because after a while it wasn't. I got confused and tripped up a few times and I almost finished it. I had everyone, the water girl joining last, and I didn't know where to go or what to do so I quit.Using the DS's lower screen with the little stick to go through menus was fun for a while. The graphics weren't bad but could've been a little better. Controls were easy enough to manage.3.8 stars."
3,Simple and Kid-Oriented,"This game is a very simple RPG. Very good game for a beginning or young RPG gamer. This game lacks depth in both storyline and character development. Battles are not very strategic and although the boss battles are sometimes difficult they are never impossible. Sometimes there is gap in the information as to what to do next in the game, but the game is so linear it does not take much sleuthing to discover where to go or what to do next."
2,Potential unfulfilled,"This game has terrific design---it's one of the best-looking games on the DS. The colors are well-chosen, the character models are good, and the use of the dual screens, particularly during boss battles, is clever. Unfortunately, the combat is way too shallow---or at least it is during the first ten hours, and I didn't have the patience to play any further. It might be a nice ""My First RPG"" for very little kids, but otherwise, enjoy the screenshots and pass on the game."
3,Its not that bad,Its ok. The character designs are horrible!!! For reals there the worst I have ever seen and I have played tons of JRPG's. But everything else technically works. Like I said its o.k. No sparkles.
1,what is this?,There is no description at all and the picture is a simple sketch drawing. What in the world is this thing?
3,nicely built but not heavy duty,the contacts are not heavy duty. there is also no on/off switch on this so you need an already installed switch. you can't prime unless holding the contact by hand. other than that it will work for maybe 2 years or so before needing replaced.
5,excellent well pump controller,Adjustable cut in and cut out set points allow you to increase pressure. Unit is well made in Mexico. Good price from Amazon.
5,"Good name, works great","I have well water in a 22 year old house. Old switch kept cycling on and off. Plus sometimes it wouldn't turn on, so I thought this switch was bad. I turned off the main power switch, drained the pressure. I found there was sand and rust in the small pipe this switch was attached. I cleaned out the rust and sand which was the real problem. I installed this switch because it was new and also because of it's higher turn off pressure at 60#. I would recommend."
2,Not made in USA as picture of product states.,Not made in USA as picture of product states.Purchased it because it was supposed to be made in USA.Deceptive advertising.
5,A Great Book!,"This engaging book makes grammar fun. It is a thorough review for students and professionals, and a solid introduction to English grammar for individuals learning the language for the first time. From who v. whom, to the split infinitive, Mr. Good entertains the reader as he teaches . . . I would call it a page turner, BUT, it is a grammar book."
5,Two Thumbs Up!,C. Edward Good has done us all a great service. He's written a much needed book on grammar that is both clear and entertaining--a masterpiece! It could even be used as a text in high school or even college. I'm buying one for each of my children.
3,Where is the data ?,"While i do not deny the contribution at providing a more or less complete treatment of neurofuzzy techniques for data modeling, i'm still wondering where the non-theoretical chapters dealing with how to cope with real data with these techniques are hidden. The few examples in the book are mostly artificial and very limited in their scope. i'm not sure people dealing with data have an interest at reading this book, it's more about neurofuzzy techniques than data modelling.The book edited by Schwefel, Weneger and Weinert entitled ""Advances in computational intelligence"" published by Springer emphasizes a lot more on fuzzy techniques based on real data although it does not discuss the ""neuro"" part of ""neuro-fuzzy"" techniques.Still this book is not bad from a theoretical neuro-fuzzy perspective, but since these techniques are aimed at dealing with real data, i would have hoped a much better treatment of the practical aspects, which it fails to provide."
4,Educational AND entertaining. What else can I ask?,"I doubt anyone who enjoys a good fiction would have liked to open an airplane training manual to learn some of the stuff I ended up learning from this book. Some of the poor reviews criticized this book for stuffing too much information into the book. However, always keep in mind that the books that benefit us are the ones most educational. This is why we outgrow Little Red Riding Hood. For Crichton to pack so much knowledge and information into the book, most of which I ended up learning and appreciating (I read most of this book through a flight), but never boring me since carrying all this information is a gripping story and gripping characters whose decision making skills can also teach us a lesson or two. As a fiction, it lacks certain suspense and pace, costing it a star. But the amount of learning you walk away with from this book, is much much higher than some 5-star fictions ther are."
4,One niggling technical detail,"A pretty good book. It was interesting to me since I have worked in Quality Assurance. Michael Crichton seems to have done his research pretty well, except for one thing. I'm not sure, but I don't think that Export Control regulations would really allow transfer of wing technology to a foreign country. Other than that, there were some interesting insights into the effect of the media on a company's product, and all that can be done on both sides to affect the outcome of a news report. Some of the tension seems to have been over-manufactured - like being pursued in the dark in a nearly empty hanger - and seem unrealistic to me. But overall a good read."
4,Very good,"4.0 out of 5 stars VERY GOOD, TYPICAL CRICHTON, November 14, 1997FOR SOMEONE WHO FLIES A LOT, AND IS ALWAYS AFRAID, I DIDN'T KNOW IF I SHOULD READ THIS BOOK. BUT CONTRARY TO WHAT I THOUGHT, I FEEL BETTER ABOUT THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY TODAY THAN EVER BEFORE. CRICHTON IS KNOWN FOR HIS DETAIL, AND HE DOESN'T FAIL HERE. I LEARNED A LOT AND REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK. IT IS A FAST READ AND A RELATIVELY GOOD STORY. TWICE I THOUGHT I HAD THE STORY FIGURED OUT, BUT TWICE I WAS WRONG."
4,Another Page Turner,"Try putting this one down!! With all the goings-on in today's airplane industry, this timely and timeless book captures the essence of big business and the desire for coverup. But is that it? Another airplane disaster under mysterious circumstances - but this one just doesn't smell right. Reporters, management, blue and white collar workers.... our heroine must get to bottom of this - for everyone involved, including her own safety. Who is right about this one? Outstanding writing!"
1,Disappointing,"I've read 7 other Crichton books and loved them, this misses the mark big time.I've always enjoyed the way Crichton teaches the science behind his chosen topic. He's always been able to write it in as an interesting part of the story. This time it was so predictable and dry - every time something technical is explained it's to begrudgingly train the new guy...boring."
3,OK,"This book was not one of my favorite Mike Crichton books; and I am a pilot. There are better of his out there. However, if you have read all of his other books this one isn't a wast of time, i just didn't find it as fun as some of his more popular books."
1,Don't read this book unless you like boring novels!!,"This book is one of the most boring novels I have ever read during my life. I'm a big Crichton fan but I cannot recommend this book to anyone. Nothing happens during the story, it also moves at a snail's pace."
1,Too Boring,"I like Michael Crichton's books. I started reading them before he became famous. But this book bored me to death. I am not into much technology and altho I enjoy learning, this was too much. The plot seemed almost a second thought to a technical manual. Please Michael, go back to your old style."
1,stupid.stupid.stupid.,I checked this book out of the library with high hopes of another masterpeice along the lines of congo and the andromeda strain.........not so.One has to wonder if the cabin pressure was'nt a bit low on the plane when MC thought up the ending to this pathetic offering. avoid at all costs.
2,Sort of blah. But an okay read.,"I read this book in three hours. I skimmed past most of the jargon, since it had barely anything to do with the plot. Every once in a while I'd stop and tell my wife, ""This is a dumb book. It's boring and slow."" And she'd say, ""So stop reading it."" And I'd reply, ""Nah, I have to find out what happens."" And perhaps that summarizes Crichton's skill, to be able to write engaging mediocrity. A stellar example of pop fiction--brain candy, an okay distraction from real life, better than a made-for-TV-movie but instantly forgettable."
2,Airframe: an instructions guide of how to deal with planes,"I just can't say that Michael Crichton hasn't the Gift to write. Yes, he does. The problem is that he's too much worried about research. I'm not saying that an author who's writing about a subject he/she doesn't dominate shouldn't research about it. But Michael Crichton is so worried about it that his books sometimes seem to be written only to those people who understand about it. And instead of a good entertainment, we have in our hands an instructions guide. That's exactly what happens to AIRFRAME. The plot is filled with information about those biggest airplanes and their structure and the whole thing. Boring. Boring. Boring."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"Where is the thrill that MC used to turn out? Not only is this book thoroughly dull, it's terribly written. Don't waste valuable hours of your life on this book."
2,Predictable and flat,"This book is a trite mystery written by a bad mystery writer. Facts emerge that the reader never knows about, and in the end the conclusion to the mystery is absurd! Flat characters, unexplained events, and sterotypes make this a poor work of fiction. Some humor though. Newsline (Nightline?) and Reardon (Koppel?) are humorously portrayed, but alas they too are mere stereotypes. Save your money. This book has little; kids might like it though."
5,An Exciting Book All The Way To The End.,"This book is so much better than Jurassic Park and The Lost World. Both of them were soooo boring at the beginning. Airframe had me turning the page constantly. I am only 14 and I usually don't enjoy reading that much, but this book was soooo exciting. I recommend this book to anyone who loves exciting books or any Michael Crichton fan."
4,Good book-- a critical portrayal of the media,"Michael Crichton has written another great page-turner in Airframe. It is a more coherent and riveting book than some of his previous novels. The success of the story is achieved not through an exhaustive dissertation on airplane technology but through his unforgiving portrayal of an unscrupulous media interested not in investigating news and uncovering truth but in menacingly carrying out an agenda that distorts and misrepresents the realtity of an airplane accident for the sake of sensation and ratings. After reading Airframe, I have no problem riding on airplanes-- but I'll never watch 20/20 the same way again!"
3,"Somewhat exciting, but overall dull","I am a great fan of Chrichton's work and have thoroughly enjoyed all of his books I have read. I was excited when I found it in paperback and I bought it. The book had some exciting chase scenes and disaster scenes, which are his specialty, but not enough to keep me happy. It was almost purely techinical which I did not enjoy. He wrote the book well and it had some good qualities but it just wasn't near as wholesome as his others."
3,Not very exciting,"The story was very informative, but it was boring. Every once in a while Crichton would through in a chase scene just to keep you from droppping the book."
4,One of his average books.,"It was a pretty good book, but nothing much compared to his other books. There isn't much to hold you in and I was really disappointed with the ending."
3,Flight of the Stereotypes,"Michael Crichton's latest script--er, novel was written in just about the time it takes to read it. The technical information is well presented, and, one hopes, accurate. Because that's all there is, folks. The characters are two dimensional, the plotting convoluted, and the payoff disappointing. Having said that, it's serviceable cotton candy--Crichton is a most accomplished purveyor of contemporary pulp fiction, and is no doubt cruising through his next bestseller at this very moment. One suggestion--skip the chapters, replace with scene numbers. It'll save the script girl some work."
3,Not my favorite Crichton novel,"I'm a big fan of Michael Crichton. As always, I enjoyed the technical detail. It inspired in me a greater interest in aviation. But this was not one of my favorites. Overall I found myself a bit bored and the ending was kind of a let-down. Not much more I can say about it."
2,very disappointed,"I kept waiting for this story to get better, didn't happen. The characters were boring, not the Michael C. I love to read. Maybe some people might enjoy. I did finish however because I had to see the end, yawn!!!!!!"
3,Not Like Michael Crichton,I am an avid Michael Crichton fan and have loved the Jurassic Park books. I choose this because I do enjoy most everything related to airplanes. I could not stand this book it was incredibly boring. Although it had some interesting facts and tid bits about the commercial aircraft field it was far to drawn out. I felt that the story could have been over in half of the pages it was. Overall I would not recommend this particular work of Michael Crichton but I have read his other books and would suggest reading them. Do not stop reading books by this author just avoid this particular book.
4,Now this you can get into...,"I found this hard to put down, the main in the book is very strong, real and interesting. One fantastic twist at the end and you want to cheer ! Take that Newsline."
3,An easy and entertaining read.,"I can't rank this book among Crichton's most exciting or interesting stories, but it is a reasonably good page-turner. And I'm tempted to give it another star for the wonderful job Crichton does of portraying the incompetence, ignorance, and sometimes deliberate deceptiveness of the American media."
3,UNEXCITING AND WEAK - UNLIKE CRICHTON,"This book will disappoint even the most avid Crichton fan. It lacks the suspense and excitement that Crichton novels are known for. If you like Crichton and want to keep it that way, don't read this. If you want to try reading Crichton, start with Sphere, which is an amazing book."
3,excellent remarks on tv-function,"Though the main issues of this book are corporate politics, air-safety etc, I found the remarks-or should I say footnotes?- on TV-everyday-business really amazing. Crighton's thoughts on how TV works and how viewers receive TV-messages and TV-""information"" are really deep and can make a reader think a little on that issue. I have read 2-3 Crighton books and they were rather boring. This one was an exception."
4,Heavy On Suspense.,"Airframe is full of suspense. In scenes were Casey is getting chased around the company, and when she recieves the threatening phone calls. It was good writing. Crichton displays a goos stroyline, and unlike Congo doesn't get too informational. I enjoyed reading Airframe."
5,Airframe flies high in full afterburn as the mystery unfolds,This book was a joy to read. The writing style is so smooth and the story moves along quickly with no wasted narrative. I was dissapointed at the end--not because of the ending--but just because there wasn't any more to read
1,A screenplay pretending to be a novel,"No, no Mr Chrichton, if you need to write a screenplay, please do not publish it as a novel! I loved Jurassic and Rising Sun,but please do not waste my money again. You just left out ...lights..action...! Your screenplays are excellent and make for wonderful TV and movies. Please just make up your mind which hat you are wearing"
3,"A good thriller, but just average for Crichton","If you like Crichton novels, you'll like Airframe. The plot builds well, but still, it didn't knock me out. I'd rate Airframe behind Jurassic Park, and on a par with Sphere and the Congo"
4,"A quick, suspenseful jolt into the world of aviation!","I enjoyed Airframe. It was a quick read, and something I didn't put down for long. With all the recent airline news, it was an interesting spin on the ""behind the scenes"" investigative stuff usually not seen in everyday life. Strong lead women character, perhaps that's why male crichton readers don't like it in the reviews below. It had me surprised right up until the end. Differnet from other chrichton books, yes, but definately worth reading"
3,Not up to Crichton's normal excellence,"I am an avid fan of Mr. Crichtons and have eagerly divoured his previous works - all of them. After finishing Airframe, my only feeling was one of having wasted a couple of hours reading a book that appeared to have been thrown together.There was a significant amout of industry jargon, much more four lettered words than normal, and a plot that sort of left me feeling like I just finished a rerun of 'Murder She Wrote'.His normal work stands head and shoulders above the rest of the techno-thrillers; this one, however, just barely came into the average range"
4,EXCELLENT AUDIO BOOK,"I HAVE NOT READ AIRFRAME, BUT LISTENED TO THE UNABRIGED AUDIO BOOK. IT IS LONG (11 HOURS), BUT VERY WELL DONE. THE PERSON READING THE BOOK DOES A GOOD JOB OF VOICE INFLECTIONS FOR THE DIFFERENT CHARACTERS AND IS A VERY LISTENBLE READER. IF YOU ARE TAKING A LONG ROAD TRIP, YOU WILL FIND AIRFRAME AN ENTERTAINING COMPANION"
4,Great Techno Story-But forget about the Enemy,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book except for one point: making an enemy of the floor workers on the pplane. I found the big chace seen through the plane to be completely unbelievable.But the most fascinating part of the book for me was the description of how stories get made on shows like 60 minutes. From now on, I'll never again wonder what the importance of the producer of those shows is"
2,Not worth it.,"I picked up this book and read the back, deciding it looked like a suspensful, gripping story about a strange happening in the air. I still thought this 3 chapters in, but then it slowly faded to a boring novel about a bit of turbulance that killed 3 people. Not a very good plot, a very disapointing climax."
5,I couldn't put it down!!,The action started right at the beginning and he kept me interested all the way through the book. He described the terminology he used and I felt that I understood all the technical terms even though I knew nothing about aeroplanes. It was a brilliant book and I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone!
2,Very disappointed.,"After his previous books I was SO anxious to read this; only to be real disappointed in it. It was disjointed. It presented several scenarious that never went anywhere. I have to admit though, the ride for the reporter was pretty good - she had it coming"
2,Airframe Crashed!,"How disappointing to pick up a Michael Crichton book expecting great ""I can't put it down"" reading. Shallow characters; read more like a screenplay. Boring with a rather unbelievable ending"
4,Crichton can still write !!!,"After reading the ""The Lost World"", I was very disappointed with Crichton as a writer. Airframe was a pleasant surprise !! Granted that there were similarities between this book and ""Disclosure"", but this book provided an interesting insight in the aircraft industry. The lead charcter for a change turned out to be a strong, independent woman who knew her stuff. The ending as usual was somewhat sensational, but then I could live with it"
2,What did I miss? Was I on autopilot?,"I was really enthused and interested at the beginning of the book, but as we cruised on it was like parts were just filler to get to the end of the book. I have read other Crichton novels and felt that this was written for a movie or mini-series rather than for readers"
3,A disappointment.,"As usual, Crichton has written a suspenseful book. But this one did not hang together well. The key to the solution was an anonymous article and picture sent to the investigator, but Crichton never showed how the sender knew that the picture would match other evidence that only the investigator had seen. Also (and maybe this was intentionally ironic) in a one-sided, shallow, agenda-filled way, Crichton portrayed television reporters as one-sided, shallow, and agenda-filled"
2,Important information missing,"Airframe is a page turner, no question about it. But although the writing style is indeniably Chrichton, the plot just isn't - it is actually too obvious.And then, Chrichton fails to provide the single most important piece of information: who is the camcorder manufacturer?"
2,Though I'm generally a fan of Michael Crichton...,"...I thought Airframe was pretty lame. 2 stars are for two afternoon's pleasant and quick read through of the first 250 or so pages, and for learning some interesting details about the aircraft industry and airplanes themselves. Minus 3 stars are for the totally contrived and uncompelling ""twist"" that brings this novel to an abrupt halt 100 pages later. On the plus side: 1) Airframe is a very fast read; 2) for a few hours a reader can at least entertain the hope that something dramatic will eventually happen; 3) the novel cost me 50 cents at a used bookstore. On the downside: 1) the novel hashes out a lot of the same details again and again; 2) the basic story is beyond skeletal; 3) the conclusion (and its exciting-lead-in) are lame lame lame. A penny more than 50 cents and I'd be pretty ticked."
2,Information at the expense of character,"One thing about a Crichton book, you will learn things.The problem you usually learn them at the expense of little things like character development. The idea of a book dealing with the study of an airplane malfunction, with occasional rants against the people who are supposed to protect our safety was a good one. Crichton once again fills a book with a tremendous amount of information and barring a background in the field, the casual reader will be dazzled by the quantity of info presented. (The quality would need a more expert opinion than mine.)However cookie cutter characters abound and they are often interchangeable with the most cursory of description and motivation. Sometimes I think Chrichton decides to research things that he is interested in and than thinks, ""This might make a good book."" Not this time."
5,Another Crichton Classic,"This book is just downright amazing. It kept me on the edge of my seat. I couldn't put it down, and actually stayed up until 2:30 A.M. to finish it one night! I just couldn't put it down until I found out what happened to Casey Singleton and The Norton Company. The characters are perfectly developed and are easy to relate to. I could picture every character Crichton presented. He used a perfect blend of ""good"" guys and ""bad"" guys.The plot was even more amazing than the characters. All the subplots came together in the end. After I was done, I could sit back and think about each of the plots and see how realistic they were. If you didn't know whether this novel ws fiction or non-fiction, you wouldn't know. It was so believable. Crichton puts you right into the novel with his great setting descriptions, beautiful character development, and excellent plot flow. This is truly one of the greatest novels I have ever read."
1,Gag Me,"It's too bad that the rating scale does not include negative numbers that would be more appropriate for the book. This novel was thin, boring, senseless, elementary reading level, and all-around awful. Don't read it- don't even borrow it from the library b/c of the risk of inferring a 10 cent fine for late fees because you feel obligated to finish the book, but you keep putting it off because it is so awful. Spare yourself"
1,Maybe Crichton's WORST Book,"I'm very disappointed, the plot is really weak, looks like a cheap 2 hours TV special. The final chapter is Ridiculous. Don't waste you money/tim"
5,He keeps getting better,"-Michael Crichton, has excelled in this book, he has used his amazing ability to make a story informational as well as compelling at the smae time. I have read all of his books and I beleive this is the best book he has written. I hope that you enjoy it as much as I have. :)"
4,Don't read before flying...,Excellent book. I made the mistake of reading it before flying to go to a wedding. Noticed a lot of things about the way the plane works that I wouldn't have ordinarilly.
2,This book was very disappointing,This book was just a poor rewrite of Disclosure. I thought the plot was almost the same (person gets set up to take the fall for others). I read it but would recommend any other Crichton book over this one.
3,This book was very good but not the best that he wrote,This book was a good book and I enjoyed reading it. The book did not have as much action as the other books that Michael wrote. The book contained many facts that were etited out in the cd version.
4,Great Book! Don't read this one while taking a flight!,"I always enjoy Crichton books and I was not disappointed with this one. It was fast reading,educational and exciting. Unfortunately, I started reading it while flying from Chicago to San Francisco and almost finished it on the return flight. I will never sit on a plane without my seat belt tightly fastened."
4,Bravo!Bravo!,"Nicely done. Concise. Complex plot to a simple explination. Think before you give your kids the keys to your car next time:). I love how MC leaves out alot of scene descriptions, allows my imagination to paint the canvas! His knowledge on his subject always seems to be complete, this novel is no exception."
3,"Gripping, but skewed view about the world outside US","should admit that the book was gripping - a one sitting read,but one -especially if you are not from US - cannot ignore the racial overtones that are plenty in this book, it sounds more like the author could not resist adding them, because at some places he could have done without qualifying the characters with their racial descent, but he has added it.The author often makes it a point to say that concern for quality and public safety is lacking outside US. but after having worked in the US for some time, i am convinced that most US companies care only for short term gain, and image, just like those TV guys in this novel."
1,dull unless you are a airplane mechanic,"I found this text to be dull and predictable. The continued reference to structure, by part number or something similar, was extremely boring. You could sense what was coming next for the characters.I have read every Crichton novel and this one is at the bottom of the heap. Save your money. This may have been done for bucks rather than bounce. Airframe needs to be grounded."
3,What was he doing?,Crichton must have been on vaction when he worked on this novel. The characters are two dimensional and the story is boring but plausable. Not one of Crichtons best works by far! Not representive of the great writer that he is. Other earlier works show his superb writing style much more elegantly than this work. I am still a Crichton fan however this is not one of his best works.
5,A great book for anyone,"At first when I heard this book was about an airplane crash, I was reluctant to read it. I decided to pick up the book and while I was reading it, I was surprised at how interesting it could actually be, despite the fact that I am petrified of airplanes. This book is great for everyone. I learned a lot about airplanes, for example what slats and proximity sensors are. The storyline is very realistic and the dialogues seem like they could actually be heard outside on a regular day. This is Michael Crichton at his best. It is such a great book!"
3,"Fun, quick read...","The chapters are pretty short so the pages turn quickly. It is, as others have pointed out, a very good overview of the airline manufacturing industry and even the news industry. The characters are very 1 dimensional but I found myself really wanting to know what caused the incident in the end.I love to travel, but HATE to fly. Strangely, this made me feel more confident in the metal tube with wings that hurls me from place to place at mach .8."
2,Beach fodder,"Crichton knows how to write a page-turner. Yet in this case, it's analogous to eating Doritos. You know they're not great food, and after the first few, they're not even that tasty...you just can't stop. An hour later, after you've eaten the bag, you definitely don't feel all that great.Characters are stereotypes and flat as paper. We don't really learn what makes these people tick. Plot is relatively predictable. If the whole cast of characters crashed in the plane most readers probably would not feel a bit of loss. The only characters that we may feel some empathy with, the young family in the first scene, are disposed of and never referred to again. Ironically, Crichton's main thrust here is a criticism of the vapid and substanceless media of commercial television news. And that's pretty much what he delivers up here in print.You'll read it to the end but it's lite stuff. Beach fodder. Put it in the empty bag with the Doritos and coke cans when you're done."
4,A scenic flight,"I certainly liked this novel. True, I have a zestful curiosity for learning about aviation -- and this novel packed a punch for that. Still beyond that, I found it a neat thriller drama with an unusual business twist. It mixes media and publicity with big manufacturing, international trade, and government safety monitoring and policing. Different. I could hardly put it down.The only downside I'd say is that maybe a few of the characters seemed a bit too simple, at times like stick figures. All the same, the writing style carried the whole story with verve. It's been nearly three years since I read it, and it seems like just a few months ago. Vivid."
3,A Fun Read.,"Michael Crichton was a professional. He had a habit of taking topics and creating characters to make it work as a novel.Airframe is about a conspiracy in an industry I know nothing about. Airplane construction. I still don't know much, but I know more now than I did. It is a tale of a single, unsuspecting person being thrust into a slew of scenarios that are beyond them.I advise reading this if you are looking forward to a quick read that doesn't require deep concentration.t"
4,wow,"When reading a Cricton book I am almost certain to enjoy the reading, and I wasn't let down. If you are looking ror a great novel with a lot of suspense and we keep you turning page after page, I recomend this novel.If you are a first time reader I also recomend Sphere, another great novel by Cricton."
2,"Like an airline meal, you can probably do better yourself","I have enjoyed every Crichton book I've ever read, but this one is a poor example of his capability. As another reviewer mentions, I have been contemplating writing a novel myself; I'm positive I can do better than this.I eagerly read through the book, finishing in three short evenings. But I blazed through the bog just *knowing* that Crichton would have a dramatic ending, and would reveal a fantastic reason the plane experienced its ordeal.I won't reveal the ""shocking"" ending here out of politeness to those who have not read it, but I can assure you it is quite tame. Very, very disappointing. I could sum up the entire plot in two or three sentences, and you would gain nothing more by reading the book (unless you are in the aircraft manufacturing business).Read ""The Great Train Robbery""; it is Crichton at his best: weaving an intriguing, complex story. ""Airframe"" is indeed an aviation mishap."
3,At best...mediocre Crichton,"I've read just about every Michael Crichton book and this falls into about the middle to bottom range on my favorites list. Plot is just not very interesting and gets to be plain out boring, even on a subject that I find particular interest in. I was disappointed but it is not unbearable."
3,Not Upto Mark,"I would rate this as the worst book by Crichton. I bought this book with great anticipation but was highly disappointed. The author has used lot of technical/aviation terminology (must have done extensive research). However, the plot never builds up convincingly. There are too many characters and the plot is quite clear in the first 75-100 pages. definitely, if airframe science interests you, this might be good read."
2,Airframe by Michael Crichton is probably his worst to date.,"I was a HUGE Crichton fan before disaster struck. This book was overtly technical (which was unneccesary to the plot), and long winded. The climax was not the usual intensely satisfying ""death by chocolate"" experience we have come to expect. More like a ""huh? That's it?"" However, I readily forgive the master of fiction in anticipation of his next novel"
3,"""Paging Dr. Mike. Paging Dr. Mike. Report to proofreading.""","I enjoyed the book. It's suspenseful. The action is steady.But when you put it down, after learning all of the details,you're kind of wondering, ""That's it? That's what caused theincident?"" I think most pilots would be a little skeptical.He has a good climax, and if you've grown to hate the media,there are some scenes you're going to love. However, thereare a couple of serious plot flaws especially surroundingthe origin of a particularly damaging video tape. It doesn'treally harm the story, though. Give it a try. Chancesare you'll be able to pronounce most of the words."
4,"A good book, just not up to Crichton's potential","Airframe is a very good, readable book that teaches the reader alot about airplanes and airplane safety. It's better than The Lost World, but far inferior to Jurrasic Park and Disclosure"
2,UGH!,"After reading this book, I feel like I could fly, repair, and/or build an aircraft now! I was interested in the characters, and that's the only reason I finished the book. I was totally lost and couldn't care less about all the technical jargon Mr. Crichton used. I love most of his other books, but Airframe seemed more like a ""How to build a plane, or investigate a plane crash in 30 days or less, all from the comfort of your own home"" instruction manual. Ugh"
4,I'll make this simple,"I just have one thing to say. The most important factor inCrichton's books is that he meticuously researches every detailinvolved with the topic. When I read his books, I find a perfect blend of fiction and reality."
2,tedious,"It started out great, with an interesting mystery, but it soon got tiring. I eventualy skipped to the end to see what happened."
1,Airframe Crashes from Structural Failure!,"The number of coincidences and unlikely occurrences in this plot make back-to-back lottery wins seem plausible.The inconsistencies and inaccuracies make Jesse Helms seem like a scholarly researcher.Janet Reno, Al Gore and Gerald Ford are vibrant, interesting and empathetic next to these thin characters.Anyone who didn't figure out the general nature of the ending before the midpoint of the book wasn't really trying.The only bright spot is that the movie will be ever so much better than the book."
4,Buy it at the airport before your flight!!,"I bought Airframe in desperation at the airport because I was out of reading material. I expected the usual cynical and twisted ""facts"" that are prevalent in ""industrial fiction"". Not at all! As a member of the industry, I can confirm that Crighton has captured the feel of the people involved in air transport. Even the weak corporate intrigue subplot did not detract from the sheer joy of seeing someone get it right. I finished the book about 5 minutes before we landed."
5,"For Reading at 40,000 Feet Above Sea Level","Although not as gripping as ""The Lost World,"" Crichton's latest novel, ""Airframe"" is surprisingly entertaining, giving me a glimpse to the world of airline investigations and the potential, hazardous complications therein. The ending is suprising yet satisfying. From start to finish, I rooted for Casey Singleton all the way. A movie from this book would probably not reflect the intensity of the personal fight as portrayed in the novel. A very realistic story. Strongly recommended on long flights over the Pacific Ocean."
2,Not a Crichton-class novel,"I found this book disappointing, and not even close to as captivating as his other books.If you're an airplane buff, you'll like this book. If you are a Crichton fan, maybe not."
4,"Suspenseful, captivating, good people power plays!","From the first few pages, this book drew me in. The characters, especially Casey, Randall and Marder were well developed. The intrigue mounted, the suspense element was always there, except when the technical airplane talk took over, but even that didn't stop me from putting it down. In fact, if all the techie info is on the up and up, it's partly an education on airplanes and flying.I'm an average reader, finishing 350-450 pages in 2-3 weeks. I finished this in about 10 days. It definitely kept my interest. The inclusion of TV woman Malone, half way through, gave this book a resurgence of suspense. You knew she'd get squashed, but you wanted to find out how. The ending (somewhat predictable)was still exciting. It was a hard book to put down. This was my first Crichton-read. Possibly not my last, although I'm not a sci-fi fan, which is the majority of his work."
5,Excellent,This is Crichton's best book. It starts with a bang and keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way to the end.
2,Offended by the language,I have been reading Crichton since college and enjoy the research and background he puts into his stories. Fast paced and a good story but I was put off by the profanity. I would not let my teenager read this book nor do I plan to read any other of his newer novels. Very disappointed in Dr. Crichton.
4,Solid read,"Airframe is 100% completely standard Crichton, which is to say that it's an immediately engaging story with enough facts to both make the reader feel he's learned something and feel the story is more than just imaginary. Ostensibly the novel focuses on the airline industry. But for me the more compelling story line was how the media interacts with big business and how it chooses to tell its stories. Though the television story developer and her star reporter are a bit too extreme, seeming more parodies than believable characters, Crichton's points retain their validity.The ending snippets supposedly culled from various news sources put a nice finishing touch on the novel, both wrapping up its plot lines and emphasizing Crichton's media theme. I imagine he must have been grinning mischievously when penning the final snippet--a brilliant ending to a solid read."
2,Boo,"I was an avid Michael Crichton reader up to and NOT including Airframe. I am no longer a fan, or at least not with the same enthusiasm. I have not picked up a Crichton book ever since. I am still recovering from this literary disaster. Crichton has a knack of going into great technical detail in the middle of his books to further inform the reader. In every other book I read, this flowed quite smoothly, in Airframe, this technical information could not have been drier. The book never seemed to get off the ground as the action happened within the first 5 pages, and the remainder of the book dicusses the investigation. Simply not Crichton's best work."
3,Great Story,"I had to read this book for an aviation safety class. I didn't particularly enjoy the dramatization of the story, but the depth of research into the aviation industry is noticible. If you like a good story about turmoil in the aviation industry, not to mention a quick peek at how the industry operates, this is an amusing book. I found it modestly entertaining."
2,Decent read,"I don't particularly care for Crichton's works. I just pulled this one at random from my uncle's bookshelf in the den because I needed something to read while waiting at the mechanic's shop. Airframe is certainly entertaining, but don't expect anything too serious out of it. It has that ""made for cable tv movie"" feel to it. The character development, even among the main characters is rather shallow. I think they were intended to be almost like caricatures. The characters didn't seem to matter all that much. Their development is to give you an idea of the type of person the character is. There is no need to go beyond that. For people looking for a ""Summer Book"", this isn't a bad choice. I use that title lightly. It applies to rainy days, which we do get a lot of down here, or cold winter nights, which we don't. hehe Most people can probably tear through it in one sitting."
2,"Possibly, His weakest work.","If you like Crichton and haven't read this one, get it. But DON'T expect another ""Andromeda Strain"" or [even] ""Sphere"" or ""congo"".It is FAR, far less ""important"" than ""State of Fear""!{ His Novel ""State of FEAR"" is on my ""Must Own list""}"
3,Not really about airline safety,"Another thrilling Crichton page turner! I was expecting this to be about the dangers of flying, but in the end it left me feeling rather reassured about the safety of air travel. The real suspense in this book arise from the tensions created by the internal company politics in the airplane manufacturer, as well as from the aggressive ""reporting"" of the tabloid television crew. As usual, Crichton's characters aren't as well developed as I might like, but he knows how to pace a story and sustain interest. Definitely an entertaining read."
4,great book!,Airframe was one of the top ten books that I have ever read! It adds a certain level of humor and successfully shows the manufacturer's point of view to an air accident.
3,Not bad....but not his best,"Overall, enjoyable. I solved the ""mystery"" right away (why else even mention the hat?) and that's half the fun. I did spend several pages wanting to shake some sense into Casey. I think Mike writes better when the lead is a man. Good beach read."
5,Simply marvelous!,"This book is one of Crichton's greatest. I've read most of his others and this is only surpassed by Sphere. It is about a plane that starts porpoising above the Pacific, killing three and injuring fifty six. Casey Singleton is called in to investigate and finds herself in the middle of a huge conspiracy. I couldn't put it down!"
3,Not as good as I'd hoped....,"Airframe was only the second book by MC that I'd read, having previously read only Lost World. I had enjoyed Lost World very much, so I was looking forward to Airframe. While the story was interesting, and some of the suspense was enjoyable, I was quite disappointed with the ending. I won't spoil it for you, but I was hoping for a more powerful finish."
2,A poor read with a failed attempt to jazz up a bad plot.,"This book's a shocker. It has such a thin plot and the characters are transparent and boring. Even the potential exitement of the news story fails to thrill. It is low on action with the exception of the initial air mishap, which is riveting, but then the novel drifts in to cliches and predictability. It is hard to believe that an author who wrote the superb ""Andromeda Strain"" can write such a childish novel as ""Airframe"". It has more value as an introductory aircraft technical manual than as a thriller."
5,Crichton hits the nail on the head with another great novel!,Micheal Crichton is already one of my favorite authors but this book pushes him over the top! This story has a great story line and lets you into the world of aeronautics without any complication! This story also has some more flavor than others by putting a female in the lead role also with a position of power. This is one boook I recommend to any avid reader!
2,"Airframe, too much air....","I didn't feel that this was his best work. I liked the characters and the story line was great, but lacked in suspense until the 6th of 8 tapes. Too much detail on mundane stuff. Suspense picked up on Tape 6, but wasn't the same type of suspense like ""PREY"". Enjoyed it, but would've liked more suspense."
2,Disapponting,"This is my first Crichton book and I must say I'm very disappointed. I have another one of his books on my shelf but I'm in no hurry to read it.On the plus side the story was well researched and it provided, to a novice, an insight into crash investigation. However, the book was slow and only the fact that I'm stubborn I would have given up on it.The ending is very good but it take a long time coming.In summary, give it a miss. Good ending but you'll feel disappointed having sat through it."
3,I thought it was weak,Found myself trying to get through just to get to the good part. It never came.
2,Bad,"I am really disappointed in this book. I have always enjoyed Crichton books, and found them entertaining. This one is boring, the characters are not well-developed, the suspense negligible. I wish popular authors would forget publishing just to publish and get back to what made them interesting in the first place -- having a good story to tell"
1,Crichton at his worst....(sigh!),"I usually like what Crichton writes, but this book is awful.The Plot: Thin, and uninteresting, mixed with the old Corporate In-Fighting theme, repeated from Disclosure.The Writing: Crichton as usual. Sharp, undecorated text, not much value as true literature. Crichton doesn't usually write well. It's usually the plot that is interesting.The Characters: Cliche, all over again. A single mother with a child! Stressful and agitated corporate stereotypes.Boy, Hollywood is going to have a wild time making an awful film based on this novel. It'll be one of those fast-paced junk films with tolerable actors.My advice: Even if you love Crichton, this one is simply too boring. So sorry, Mike."
4,"As in all of Crichton's books, you learn something while being entertained.","Michael Crichton excells at teaching you while you are reading (or in my case, listening - I heard it as an audiobook read by Blair Brown).In this case, Crichton tells us about the world of airplane design and construction. However, the more compelling story is that of the news media getting the story wrong due to lazy work - the same theme as is developed in ""The State of Fear."" Seeing stories that are produced on the local level in my city about items that I have personal knowledge of, I cannot say that I disagree.Entertaining, informative read.Final grade: B+"
5,I Loved It!!,"As a flight attendant, I enjoy any books related to the airline/ aviation industry. This past Christmas, my family took a ski trip but I had broken my toe, so I wasn't able to ski. I ended up reading this book in just a few days! I was glued to it!I love Micheal Crichton's books and this is one of his best!!"
4,Worth flying for,"After having been treated to a double dinosaur special of 'Jurassic Park'and ""The Lost World"", I was a bit skeptical of reading a Micheal Crichton novel which didn't deal with the prehistoric. Anyway he pulled it off yet again but only just. The narrative is excellent and the technical detail is pretty neat though I wish he had some sort of glossary to help readers not familiar with aerospatial or avionic terms. There seemed to be a dash of 'Rising Sun' in the plot but somehow that didnt get developed too well. Thats why I lopped off one star . However, all in all, a good read .Dont take it on the plane though !"
4,Engaging and instructive,"The narrative is very engaging in the best Crichton style. Since the chapters are very short (approximately 2-15 pages) and self-contained, you can read a piece whenever you have time without loosing the thread. This book is not only entertaining, but also very informative about how commercial airplanes are built and maintained. I fly frequently on long-haul flights and this book has changed the way in which I look and listen to the airplane where I am sitting on. I give only four stars because I could figure out the end before the final chapters, but it's only a minor detail."
3,Not His Best,"This was a very quick read. It was a fairly enjoyable book, although not one of Crichton's best. I found it difficult to feel any empathy for the protagonist and most of the other characters were stereotypes. The plot was interesting enough to keep me going, but the ending was anticlimactic. A good book to read at the beach."
4,Underrated,"I read several poor customer reviews for this book, but I finished it last night, and I feel it deserves praise. The book was not overly technical. Like all M. C.'s books, I felt I learned a fair amount about the subject matter. If you felt overwhelmed by the technical information in this book, you'd better go back to your romance novels. My only criticism is the sprinkling of union violence. First of all, it seems like it was added as an afterthought to provide some action. Second, as a labor lawyer, it was totally unbelievable. Overall, however, I would strongly recommend this book."
4,Attacks Media,"I liked how this book attacked the media and not the airplane manufacurers. Chrichton makes you love to hate those newsmagazine shows where they go more for dramatic punch and not factual content. It's alot like Disclosure but it's still a great, exciting thriller."
2,This book had a great concept but simply lacked interest.,"The book started off interesting and had a well-considered plot and concept but it carried on too long. When an interested reader picks up the book in a store it seems to be very interesting but it was a let down. Crichton lacked interest in the middle of the book and I started to no longer want to finish the book. The ending is a surprise and it is something that a Crichton fan will enjoy. But for the first time Crichton lacked interest in one of his stories which was really surprising. It's a book that you can read if you don't mind long amounts of time with nothing resolved. And if that wasn't enough, the technical terms and abreviasions make the book long and hard to follow. So if you're in a mood to pick a book that is not fast paced, it's yours ! I guess the saying 'never judge a book by it's cover' stands true to this book."
2,Poor Suspense,"I'm sorry to say that AIRFRAME didn't please me at all. The plot wasn't that difficult to figure out from the start. During my reading I was over ran by many technical terms that only made sense to pilots and avionic experts. It was a major disappointment to me and probably others as well. On the back of the book read ""The pacing is fast, the suspense nonstop."" I didn't seem to find much suspense in the story. Where was it? The best part of the book was at the beginning, and it only lasted 2-3 pages. He also kept switching the scenario on me. It became confusing at times while trying to visualize the scene. So, I am sorry to say it wasn't worth the $7.99 I paid for it."
2,Sad...very sad for Chrichton fans,"I am a HUGE Michael Chrichton fan, I LOVE his writing style, and very much look forward to his novels...and boy didn't he make us wait for 'Airframe'? I would have thought with a wait so long, he would have had time to at least make it as good as his other works...I am truly sad to say this falls way below Chrichton's past works of art. As a simple story, it was good in it's own way, and Chrichton DID keep the pages turning, but it just didn't have any 'magic'. His other novels are SO good that I kept reading in anticipation that a major cliffhanger would arrise and take my breath away...unfortunately it never did. I cannot tell you how sorry I am that I feel this way...like I said earlier, I am a HUGE fan of Chrichton, but NOT of 'Airframe'. Sorry for those who disagree. Let me hear YOUR thoughts on my views: rmgomske@lightcom.net Thanks and go read something ELSE by Chrichton."
2,Crichton fans will be disappointed,"""Airframe"" is probably Michael Crichton's weakest novel. As usual, the author shows to have done extensive research, but it seems as if the book was being specifically tailored to fit a future movie version. Worse, if you've read ""Disclosure"" or ""Rising Sun"" it's easy to predict the ending from the opening pages.Nevertheless, ""Airframe"" does keep the pages turning. It may be a cookie-cutter style novel, but at least it's fun. Crichton fans will be disappointed, but those new to his work may get a fresher read."
4,MC Pulls Through Yet AGAIN,"WOW. How can one author write a 350+ page book about airplanes and at the same time allow the reader to enjoy every part of it? This book is excellent, yet I would recommend (if you're deciding about buying a MC book) his newest-Timeline. Airframe was almost as good but not quite. I found the exhaustive airplane terminology boring and felt that it slowed down the novel. However, airplane terminology was much needed for Airframe. The reader does not need to know about airplanes to enjoy the book though since MC's masterful skill of allowing each character to discuss a specific part of the airplane allows the reader to better understand the ""airplane"" as a whole. I would have given this book a 4.5 star rating. So if you enjoy reading about airplanes, or would like to know more about them, read this book. If you're more into physics/chemistry, time travel and the medieval era, read Timeline."
4,My Two Cents,"Three passengers dead and 56 injured. A fatal midair disaster aboard a commercial jet traveling from Hong Kong to Denver triggers a pressured and frantic investigation by the head of the Incident Review Team, Casey Singleton. A fantastic book with an involved yet easy-to-follow plot line."
4,Crichton Is At it Again!,"I am a long time fan of Michael Crichton's work. From the first big book I ever read (Jurassic Park) in 5th grade to the most recent I've read, which happens to be Airframe, I still have yet to read a boring book of his. Airframe is one of his better works. A plane goes through a disastrous turn of events during a routine pan-pacific flight, killing some passangers. Now the company must figure out what has happened before a big sale of aircraft to China blows over. Annoying reporters, conspiracy craving executives, and an exciting plot make this an edge of your seat page turner. I couldn't put the book down. I loved every page of it. Definately a must buy for aerospace and Crichton fans."
2,Why is Crichton so popular?,This book gives me the urge to write myself. Probably because I think I could do better. The characters are as thin and underdeveloped. This is the first Crichton book I've read. I thought I might enjoy it since I work in the aerospace industry. The technical details are accurate but not impressive.
4,Easy Read -- Enjoyable but not the best,"This was a short read and I enjoyed it, especially toward the end when I wanted to finish it and find out what caused the plane to crash. There are definitely better books to read, but this novel was very informative about the airline industry, and I enjoyed that."
3,The Predictable Side of Crichton,"It has become a standard for Michael Crichton to thoroughly investigate the scientific aspects of his stories and then wrap this knowledge within the context of a mystery/thriller. In Airframe, the story is predictable and the science not that exciting. The story reminded me too much of Rising Sun, with too many pat answers to difficult issues."
5,AWESOME at least,I see Casey(the main caracther) as a smart woman kind of like Liv Tyler beutiful and yet smart. If you don't want to read it start making lines on the Movies. This book is going to be a multi-million dollar movie...
3,"Crichton lowers his standards in Airframe, but pulls it off","Michael Crichton's detailed description is ever-present in this reality check novel, however his great sense for action seems to be absent. The entire topic of airline scandal is perhaps weak, and already overexploited by the media. The topic is obviously a personal interest of Crichton's, and the book reflects heavy research, but is only exciting to a certain degree. A fairly dry read for Crichton fans, but overall an OK read."
3,Gripping but not as good as previous books,"This book not only deals with office politics but also deals with the way the media handles situation. This book is gripping and has some very intense moments, but i found the ending to be very disappointing. There was no new insight into anything and the final revalation was a complete letdown. I have read all of his books and this is better than some but not as good as others."
4,A fun and engrossing suspense novel; also educational,"***** LOOKOUT for the review by Lauren Brown. Her 2nd paragraph is pure spoilers!! *****While not in the same league as many of Crichton's earlier novels, the story is enjoyable enough as it is. I felt empathy for the main character and appreciated all the obstacles she ran into. I learned some neat stuff about commercial planes and aviation. Don't worry, it's quite easy to follow for anyone of reasonable intelligence.I especially liked the last 50 pages or so, as he really brought the story in for a rapid landing (get it? ;-)If you read real carefully on the last page or so, you get a good chuckle when you realize what the ""official report"" actually said (and WHY it was said that way)."
3,Not something you'd want to read on an airplane!,"Fifty-nine casualties. Severe problems in the cockpit. The interior destroyed. Yet somehow, the pilot successfully lands the plane. When a jet liner from Hong Cong to Denver hits disaster, it is up to TransPacific airlines to see why and how the plane was virtually destroyed. However, a nosy reporter might beat them to the solution. Everything is put on the line when a drastic test is done to keep TransPacific and Norton Aircraft's squeaky clean reputation. Even though I didn't enjoy ""Airframe"" as much as some of Crichton's other masterpieces, this was suspenseful nonetheless. A New York Time's bestseller, this is a must-read about safety and death in the skies; a thrilling work of art that will keep you on the edge of your seat. (Hint: don't read this when you're on an airplane like I did. The result isn't too good.)"
2,I must have missed something...,"Because I didn't like this book at all. It was bogged down w/ technical jargon. It didn't refer to the underlying intrigue enough. The only reason I continued w/ the book is because I kept thinking it would get better. The ending was okay, but not worth reading all the other boring chapters to get to it. This is the first Crichton book I read and I was very disappointed."
5,One of Crichton's best,"Great characters, great story with lots of the usual Crichton detail. Definitely recommended."
2,Nothing new here.,"With all the hype and tension the real life media is creating about the ""dangers"" of flying, Crichton has attempted to take it one step further. However, the poor character development does not help the weak story line. If you are looking for something to do to kill time, this is the ticket. It seemed to me that he is just writing to get another movie deal"
3,Good story ends with more characters,"Crichton being Crichton has added aviation to his list of techno-conquests. Surely he will come full circle and do one set in outer and maybe inner space as it remains to be seen. However...please make sure a character that is dead, stays dead. On page 15 Casey's mom died when she was an infant, so Casey was raised by a household of men. Unless daddy lied, about her mother, she's back! On page 248 (first paragraph) Casey tells herself she'd better get some sleep. She didn't want her mother to call afterward (afterlife?) saying, ""Dear, you looked so tired...""Casey...""What about you mom?""Or...Casey faints dead away.Still a good story but leave mom in the movie, she can take care of the daughter."
3,Strange Crichton Book,"I liked the beginning and body of the book, but it was not what you would expect of Michael Crichton. It was interesting, but strange coming from Michael Crichton"
5,Another gripping page-turner!,"This book reminded me very much of ""Disclosure."" It is another corporate-thriller (even the structure of the novel is quite similar), a very thrilling page-turner and very interesting. The only differences to ""Disclosure"": It has no sex in it and it will be much more difficult to film because of its many technical details. And it will be a safe bet that this film will not be shown on airplanes.."
3,Airplane reading at best,"It seems that Mr. Crichton has decided to incorporatethe assembly line mentality when it comes to writing books -get one out every 6 months regardless of content. Story isok, character development non-existant and information contentbelow what we expect from Cricthon."
2,Author blatantly selling his soul to commercialism,"Airframe promised much, delivered some, informed little. MichaelChrichton, not that he needs the money, has sold his soul. This bookis atypical of the work eminating from ""leading"" authors today, in ourhollywood obsessed world. Is it a Novel? Is it a Book? No, it's 30 minutepitch to a movie mogul. Chrichton, why don't you go back to theoriginality and creativity showed in Westworld et al?? This is a seriouslow point in what could have been a career of infinite highs"
3,Not great writing but a good vacation read,"Reminiscent of ""Hotel"" or ""Airport"", Crichton packs a lot ofinformation into a very thin storyline. Characterization is superficial.I found myself trying to figure out what actors would playeach character when the movie comes out.The technical jargon is enough to be educational but not so much as toget in the way of the plot. Both sides of most issues were presented.It was enough for the reader to realize the airplane industry is veryvery complex and solutions are not easy. However, given that complexity,the ending was very simplistic.But if what you want is an interesting quick read over a weekend or vacation,this is a good book. Besides, everyone will read it and will now be water cooler airlineindustry experts. You can't be left out."
4,Technically Correct...riveting...good reading!,"As an airline pilot with a Major US Carrier, I found Airframe to be very good reading. Crichton took his time to research the various areas of aviation to produce a technically correct novel. It was also a personal story for me, since I, like Casey Singleton, graduated from Wayne State University and grew up in Detroit, MI.It was exciting reading with a number of twists and turns. Not Crichton's best writing, but very good, none-the-less"
5,Great routines,I was surprised how much of the music we were able to use in our routines. The short segments are easy to use with other routines. We even used a couple full routines off the CD as is. Very punchy production.
4,Great Picks,"Wow, these are all the songs I've been listening to over and over again the last seven plus years. I may have picked a few different songs or added more like Starting Line - Cheek to Cheek, Something Corporate - If U C Jordan, Something Corporate - Down, The Early November - Something That Produces Results, Halifax - Sydney, and a few others. But these are their greatest hits and def bring back a lot of great memories."
3,Mediocre,This CD has Drive-thru's most popular bands but allowing two songs from bands like Finch is unnessacery and disgusting. Why put Starting Line's poppy sounding songs but not musical songs like 'Photography'. CD is okay but should have more Arists and songs that haven't played out.
3,Missing bands,"Drive-Thru Records does have a few talented bands. This CD, unfortunately, does not do these bands any justice. What's with the fact that New Found Glory, the Starting Line, and Something Corporate (and maybe a couple others, I didn't check) have more than one song? I, personally, don't think it's fair. In addition to this, the song selection is mediocre. These songs have been overplayed, and are now boring.Overall, it would be better to support the individual bands, rather than purchase this CD."
5,ESTE LIBRO PUEDE CAMBIAR TU VIDA!,ESTE LIBRO ES TAN IMPORTANTE LEERLO PORQUE TE ENSEBNA COMO LOGRAR EL BIENESTAR Y ABUNDANCIA Y PROSPERIDAD QUE NECESITAS TRAYENDOTE UNA INMENSA PAZ INTERIOR ASI COMO UN SENTIMIENTO DE REALIZACION PORQUE DESPUES DE LEERLO SABES QUE CON SOLO PONER EN PRACTICA LO QUE EN EL DICE ESTAS A UNOS CUANTOS PASOS HACIA TU COMPLETA SATISFACCION AL VERTE REALIZANDO TODOS TUS SUENOS!
5,Great boots,I purchased these boots in september for the hunting season. I have recently purchased another pair for my father I liked them so much.
4,great boots,"Great boots,fit great the second time around,which was my bad the first time,ordered them to narrow,very stylish,had alot of compliments on the style"
2,Misses the mark,The music is kind of interesting. I think the artist is trying to be deep but the lyrics miss the mark. They just never take hold. This may have been a better instrumental album. I'm not sure that I would give this CD a second listen.
4,Things Are Getting Better,Very good example of Eddie Jefferson's mature work. Definitely for jazz fans. A great listen.
5,Hella good is HELLA GREAT!,"no doubt's new single from their recently released record, ""Rock Steady"", is one of the greatest singles of their career. It satisfies everyone from the alternative rock fans all the way down to the hip hop crews. Hella Good is only one of the great tracks off of Rock Steady, my opinion is that all of the songs are great! Hella Good, Don't Let Me down, and Underneath it all(featuring a guest apperance from jamaican singer Lady Saw) are the standout tracks. A+++"
4,Great for the money,"Are there better notebooks? SureAre there better deals than this one with all the rebates? Maybe not. I paid $... after all was said and done! (Ok, some of my rebates haven't come back yet, but it hasn't been very long yet)The only reason I'm not giving this notebook 5 stars is because it doesn't include a floppy or CD-RW. It wasn't that important to me, but 5 stars should be reserved for a perfect product.-It doesn't get too hot. I've been programming on it for the last 3 hours while it sits on my lap and it's not even hot to touch.-The battery does lose power comparibly fast, but I don't use it much. Usually I'm plugged into an AC outlet.-The 20 gb hard disk is sufficient as is the 256 mb ram. You can upgrade the ram, I probably will.I am happy with this system. It has a good display and I like the size (It's not that heavy, I've had notebooks that were heavier)."
1,Don't let the price fool you.,"...I was very disappointed. First, the design is the worst among the brands. Second, its display is not as good as the others also. Then I try the keyboard. When I pressed on one key, the whole keyboard goes down (I have never see any laptop as (inexpensively made) as this one)..."
4,Here's the real skinny on the CPU and temperature...,"For all you people arguing over what is in this puppy and how hot it runs, here is the actual output of a couple of Linux commands:$ cat /proc/cpuinfoprocessor : 0vendor_id : GenuineIntelcpu family : 15model : 2model name : Mobile Intel(R) Celeron(R) CPU 1.50GHzstepping : 7cpu MHz : 1495.613cache size : 8 KB...snip...$ cat /proc/notebook/temperatureCPU temperature: 57 CFan off temperature: 55 CFan speed 1 temperature: 60 CFan speed 2 temperature: 65 CFan speed 3 temperature: 93 CMinimal temperature to set: 25 CMaximal temperature to set: 95 CFan status: offThis is an ACPI-only notebook, so its a bit tricky to get Redhat 8.0 Linux installed on it. But we've got the process down now, so it only takes about 5-10 minutes more than usual to get it up and running. Not bad for 5 C notes."
4,Amazon Gets It.,"This review is more about Amazon than the Sharp system. Got for $90.00 with free shipping so no major investment. It arrived broken-parts of the CD trays laying on the bottom of the carton. The tuner worked fine and I was tempted to keep it, expecting I'd have to front return shipping at the least. Here was Amazons response. We're sorry (how unique these days); we're sending a new one today- with 2 day shipping; after the new one arrives and if it's ok-then send the broken one back. I guess when you're competing with the box stores you go the extra mile on service. Bravo. By the way, the system sounds great."
1,"Good sound, poor performance!","As the other reviewers have said, this unit sounds great, but it is very erratic when it comes to playing CDs. Also no resumer capability for the CDs. If you press stop and start, it does not pick back up on the track you stopped on. It seens to play my mp3 CDs fine, but there is too long of a pause between tracks, and it won't play plain regular audio CDs at times. Then tonight, I tried repeatedly to eject disc 3, and it kept opening the 4th tray. Then it wouldn't open disc 2 either. I had to shut the unit down. When I powered back up, it allowed my to eject my CDs, and this piece of junk player is going back into the box!"
1,disapointed,"The 5 disc player is very slow. Also, when you try to create a mix, (random) it only plays about 4-5 songs over and over. I know it is supposed to be random but your odds of hitting the same song 3 times in a row in a 50-70 song playlist doesn't strike me as very random. Sure, if it only happened once or twice, but everytime I make a playlist, that is the result."
3,A decent Adams book,"Even though life is hard during the thirties, the families and businesses of the Adams family are doing well. But then while out for tea with his wife the Chinese Lady, Edwin Finch goes missing. While there are very few clues, a parrot belonging to Cassie Brown may hold a secret to the were abouts of Mr. Finch.""Missing Persons"" is the sixth book in the Adams series, While it was a decent book, I have to say that I didn't enjoy it as much as earlier books due to the other storyline. But I know that the series will get better."
2,shipment is so so slow,Why the shipment is so slow that I could not get it even the class have almost finished the first several weeks.
1,STAY AWAY! Look like painted pearls - with paint peeling off!,These look great in the picture online but in reality the pearls look like they were covered with a black coat of paint and was peeling off in some parts. The packing also looked old. Disappointing. Probably the seller sent me a bad product. I had to go through some trouble with the seller to get a return shipping label.
3,question,"I haven't read the book yet (had to assign stars or this couldn't be posted) but I am curious as to whether the authors provide solid empirical evidence (not merely anecdotal) that the vast majority of those who download child pornography are also child MOLESTERS. We don'tassume consumers of adult porn are rapists. I deal with this problemat www.differentdrummer.typepad.com in a post called ""Child Pornography Hysteria."" I should say I personally have no interest in either child or adult porn and do not condone adults having actual sex with children."
5,But too bad they left out the May Sarton essay...,"I've used Guidelines for my advanced ESL composition course at a community college for the past six or seven years, and it's the best book I know of for the purpose. My only regret is that May Sarton's essay ""The Rewards of Living a Solitary Life"" was omitted from this new edition. I've had some great student papers that came from reading the Sarton essay back-to-back with Yezierska's ""College,"" and considering the difference between solitude and loneliness. It's only a few pages--put it back in next time!"
4,Good,This is the best book ever i recomend everybody to buy this awesome book thanks for having the chance to have it...
5,great,I bought this book because im taking ESL class and I decided to get it from amazon because was cheaper than everywhere.
3,"Okay dress, but plan to return.","This dress was pretty affordable, but it's difficult to wear because it in between being lingerie being a dress, and for taller people it might be more like a shirt than a dress. I'm 5'2'' and about 110 pounds, so for me, it is the right length for a dress, only that it's actually too loose. A dress like this is not very sexy if isn't form-fitting.The fabric is kinda sheer too. Not the best quality, but you get what you pay for. I'd wear it clubbing if it fit well, but I plan on returning it."
3,Black Mini Dress,"Honestly, this is not what I was hoping for. It doesn't work too well as a dress, but it makes a really cute shirt."
3,Pedometer,I ordered 12 of these. I'd say 1/2 of them didn't work. They were inexpensive so I should have expected this. I'd pay a bit more money next time.
1,Cheap in all aspects,You get what you pay for. This pedometer broke after using it a few times. The clip on the back cracked after attaching it to my thin cotton pants. I glued a strap on it so I could keep using it and 3 days later it stopped counting. It just says 0000 all the time. I only needed something to work for 8 weeks for a contest I am doing and this failed. The same thing happened to the 2nd one I purchased. At least I didn't waste to much money on them.
2,Pedometer,Disappointed in performance of this inexpensive pedometer. Doesn't accurately do anything. Would not recommend.
5,Mom loved it,"My husband's mon love this basket. She said it was darling, colorful and pretty. She was very surprised with the gift"
2,Disappointed,"The gift basket was tiny for the price. The raspberry cookies were not very good. The chocolate cookies were yummy, but there were only two. It just wasn't worth the money."
4,Instant relieve but not for long.,"Okay, so I felt somewhat pressured to buy products after a spa massage on my last cruise. Anyway, bought the massage lotion and this refreshing gel. There is no strong scent as most menthol rubs do and it is not sticky. While this does work instantly, the ""tingle"" does not last very long. I have timed it to around 15-17 minutes. I would not buy again as the price is prohibitive."
5,One of the best books you will ever read.,I love Georgette Heyer books and this is my personal favourite. I also discoverd a superb book with a similar feel and flavour called The Adventurers by Michelle Martin. If you loved this then I gaurantee you will also love that. Link below...The Adventurers
5,This one delivers on its promise- in spades!,"This is a story you will want to come back to again and again! It has everything- action, romance, drama, swordplay, and a great deal of witty banter between the characters. It was with great difficulty that I put down this book for such boring and necessary things as sleep and work. This one is as good as- perhaps even better than-These Old Shades, another of my favorite Heyer books. What wonderful things await you inside the pages of this novel! You will not be disappointed."
4,Look smart feel great,"If you'd like to look like you are all fancy and smart then I suggest buying this book. It will give you an air of authority when the conversation inevitably turns to zen things. The chapter on swordsmanship is (as the British might say) spot on. Oh, and get you some of that sweet, sweet haiku analysis from a zenorific perspective. After you read this book you will be prepared to quickly forget all of the knowledge that the tome contained and empty your mind in the style of the zen masters. Really, you must read about the tea ceremony and consider for yourself the zenishness of setting some tea leaves in some hot water. In short, I applaud this book loudly with one hand."
2,A little repetitive,"I bought this book to learn more about the integration of golf in the 1950's-1960's. It was an ok read though he seemed to pine on about the injustice of the system and the blatant racism which is understandable given his talent. He definitely had a passion for golf, his accomplishments should be better known to the masses. The book makes me curious to learn more about desegregation cases of public and private golf courses and clubs across the U.S."
3,So so.,"The story of Sifford is a very inspiring one. The book was just written in a horrible way. Every other sentance starts with the word ""hell"". It gets boring afterwards. The first half of the book moves very slowly, but the second half picks up a little more speed. This book will let people know that before Tiger Woods, there was Charlie, Lee Elder, and a lot of other guys too. It is a very good book. What Sifford went through was just horrid, but that's the reality of the world we live in. I could never blame him for being so bitter after all these years of obstacles and not being praised for what he has done. Never mind praise - just for not being allowed to play the game of golf. My limited grasp on golf parlance probably made it a little boring to read this book. But it's a good book, although it may make you a little sleepy."
4,High with small projection over tailpiece,This rest is a little too high for me. I would prefer a cross between this one and the Teka. It has a cut away area over the tailpiece so it does not bump into my tailpiece. There is a little pointy part that goes over the tailpiece. It is higher and than an Dresden.
1,The Retard of Street Performers!,"Lets just say that watching this guy perform is worse than a train wreck because of the adolescent TV tricks. Its not amazing, thrilling or remotely interesting. I give it -40 stars, but amazon says I can't : ("
3,Starts off ok but peters out!,"Criss starts off pretty good but you get very little for your bang. Many episodes are just one stunt or just a couple of tricks. Pretty boring after a while. The real magic tricks are great but towrds the end of the season the setup, editted, fake audience, just for TV stuff (though makes great TV) is just not magic."
5,Awesome,"If Criss Angel doesn't have supernatural powers, than I don't know what's real or not anymore!"
4,Truly Post-Modern,"At first I found a lot of Chris Angel's tricks really annoying. I couldn't figure out what I was supposed to assume about what was an illusion and what was a stunt; who was in the audience and who was in the show; what was a ""real"" object and what was a magic prop; what was an unadulterated place and what was a set-up stage; and what was perceivable by the audience vs what was perceivable only by the camera. But then I decided that this was part of the genius of it. Magic presented on a traditional stage spells all that out for you in mind numbing detail. Here you're left to wonder. For example, are we really meant to believe that his family is such a bunch of dupes/dopes? There is no clear frame given for how to view this stuff, and if you're not prepared to roll with that, it can be hard to watch. If you can get passed it, however, it's a lot of fun, with some good magic thrown in."
5,Prepare to be amazed,"I recently saw Criss Angel on the TV show Phenomenon and instantly fell in love with him. I wanted more. I like having the whole first season on DVD to enjoy whenever I want without the annoying commercials. Lucky me. Criss is personable, approachable, talented, and fabulous to watch. He's easy on the eyes. too. I'm beyond satisfied with this purchase."
4,A Review of the DVD Set... Not the Celebrity,"OK. Here is, what may be, the only true review of the DVD set released by A&E Entertainment, and not a debate over who is your favorite Magician. This collection will be enjoyable to any Criss Angel fan or Magic enthusiast, so get it and grab the popcorn. But first, there are a couple of things you need to know. It is amazing that the Title is, ""The Complete Season One"", considering that 4 episodes are missing from the set. (1) The ""Bullet Catch"" episode that was ready for broadcast but banned by the network and never aired, (2) the one-hour 10/31 ""Halloween"" episode, (3) ""The Best of Criss Angel"" with scenes edited out from previous episodes, and (4) ""The Best of Criss Angel Vol.II"". I am happy that A&E released the collection, and would be glad if they released more of their programming on DVD, but remain dumb-founded that they would forget 4 episodes and then title the collection what they did."
3,Modern Houdini?,Criss Angel considers himself the new Houdini. He has a lot of good stuff in his shows but too often goes way overboard for my tastes. Younger crowd seems to love him though.
5,Amazing!!,"I was amazed when I watched this dvd set. I never had a chance to see Season 1 when it was on T.V. Criss is amazing. I especially like his smaller magic tricks that he does one on one with people. His escapes and stunts are also amazing, but made me very nervous!!! I know he says he likes to blur reality and illusion, and he does this very well in these episodes. There is something about him that draws me in, he has a very warm personality. And he's pretty darn cute! I recommend this for anyone who loves great entertainment!"
3,Good show but...,"Unfortunately, many of his good tricks are set up. I'm disappointed but it's good if you don't know they're set up in advance."
3,Best show in A&E,"I've already seen this season on A&E. Wanted to own my personal copy in DVD. One of the best shows I like. I really enjoyed it. Wish I can tap in to that part of my brain someday and do amazing things. The possibilities are endless. Watching this DVD gets you motivated, and lets you think nothing is impossible. He also educates you on which ones are fake, and how not to get scammed. Anything is possible, if you only believe."
1,Windbag!,"I know I am not the only person who finds this magician an overblown windbag. Have a little humility. The christ-like persona is sickening because he is, simply, a con-artist. I suspect if this magic thing dose'nt work out he can try 3 card monty."
2,So So,"Although his magic was quite good, it looked as if some parts had been edited. He also seems quite cocky and full of himself. No david blaine !"
4,Happy yet jilted,I purchased Season 1 and the Halloween Special together. Unfortunately most of the same stunts appear on each disc. While Season 1 had a little more I felt a little jilted. I must admit I walked away as always saying how the heck did he do that!!!!!!!
5,MIND FREAK!,"If you are a fan of the show, you must own! Like no one else Cris Angel continues to blow your mind!"
1,Magic that can only be done on TV TV Show not Magic Show,"As the seasons wear on Criss is relying more on stuff that can only be done on TV with lots of presetup, lots of fake audiences, lots of camera angles and even CGI. Too much audience interview and less substance as well. A real Shame. Fun to watch but keep in mind it's just TV. They could've hired any actor to do most of the stuff being done. Notice that there is no disclaimer about camera angles, etc. Be interesting to see season 3; Maybe by then it will all be CGI and he can just phone it in."
1,Don`t believe the hype!,"More poseur than performer, a bit lame. My advice is look up Derren Brown ,if you really want the real thing."
5,Great show,I'm a fan of magic/illusions and the second season was one of my favorites. I highly recommend this dvd to all fans of Criss Angel.
5,Great study guide,This study guide makes up for everything that the text book lacks. I got the study guide in time for the 2nd exam and oh boy has it helped. I have recommended to all my fellow class mates to get this book.
4,Maternal-Child Nursing Study Guide,The study guide work book is okey. I've only read a few chapters on the actual txt book and doing the study guide really helps because it summarizes the content of the txt book. I recommend this study guide work book for both OB and Peds.
4,Hero should have been named Rapas the Ulsio,"Like all of Edgar Rice Burroughs' books, this story is full of adventure, fighting, and saving the damsel in distress. But the hero in this book is probably the biggest wimp of all of ERB's heros. John Carter could bench press him, Carson Napier could out shoot him, and Tarzan would just ignore him and leave him to the jungle. The hero never gives his name and the reason why is because he is embarrassed to be compared to ERB's other heros. If it wasn't for the superior storyline and abstract scientific facts that cause you to think, I would have rated this book a 2. This isn't his best, but it is one Burroughs fans shouldn't miss."
2,Flimsy !,"You'd think something designed to fit into a barrel bung would be a little more stout. Thin plastic, might be OK for light use. Not what it appears to be as far as I'm concerned."
3,Swahili as a novelty,"More than you really need to know, unless you are hiring your own bearers. If you are touring with an english-speaking group, this book is a curiosity. As in any vacation, a few phrases are signs of respect for the citizens of the culture that you are visiting. This book has way more detail than one would ever need."
3,"He is a ""Hard Scorer""","Well, If you have several CDs of Patrice Caratini in your collection and you are fond of its music style, this CD is a must Have. ""Le Crabe"" is a new version completely different than the one you can find on ""Endeka"" album.very good stuff indeed!"
5,Mobile desktop functionality,"I am a student, and I use this notebook at school. I don't mind the weight (over 10 lbs with AC adapter), and I enjoy the desktop performance and the large screen. I wouldn't recommend this laptop for business travelers or others who feel that weight is an issue."
3,Road warriors be aware!,"Let me be fair, this is a top machine with above average performance.Be aware however, if you intend to use it to play DVDs from different regions. (DVD region 1,2,3,4,4,5,6)The 1955-s803 will lock the DVD-rom in one single area, once you try to alter the regions a couple of times. (It says so in the manual, so it is not hidden.)For those presentations on the road… try to carry a region-free DVD player along.You will find good offers at Amazon.com"
2,Science Manual,Incorrect book sentPicture is correct but receivedStudent Science Manual with Lab Demonstration ExcercisesSame Title of Science of teh physical creation but not the one orderered and advertisedMBL
1,How to Lose Money in Commodities,"This is not a beginner's guide to futures trading, but an incitement to pick up more of Gould's material and subscribe to his futures hotline. Historically, it's more interesting than that, as there's another futures salesman who seems to have ripped off most, if not all, of Gould's text, with slight changes. If you've ever subscribed to the most popular futures ""course"", you'll know who I mean. As for the actual method outlined, Gould doesn't tell you very much. As with his more successful pupil, there's just enough information to entice you into believing you can profit using it, but nothing about trend, indicators, the CRB, nothing at all. It's just bait, nothing more."
3,For Beginners Only,"One trading strategy, a little discipline and you too can make oodles of noodles! If you know about sideways trading ranges and how to trade them get another book. If you don't have any idea what the last sentence means you could start here. Basic primer. Easy read but not inspiring enough to make me want the rest of his books. Maybe I'm jaded, having read much and worked with the concept daily as a broker, but hey for ten bucks you might think you've just found the goose that lays the golden eggs!"
5,My review listed should be for Brother Wolf!,"This is the sequel to Brother Wolf and it is an excellent book. The other review under my name listed here should have been under Brother Wolf Not A Man Called Wolf. I'd read Brother Wolf first, but both are great reads. I just reviewed the wrong book first. Pardon my mistake, but don't miss out either book. You won't be sorry!"
1,Horrible- do not purchase!,"I make chainmaille bracelets and am in need of a sizing mandrel. I had seen the EZ Bracelet sizer on other websites for less than half the cost of what I paid through FindingKing, and with horrible reviews. Nowhere in the description does this say it's the EZ Bracelet sizer, and with the much higher price I assumed it was what I was looking for. Nope, I was wrong, this is a piece of junk! It comes flat and you are supposed to tape it together. Completely flimsy and un-usable. I will be returning this item ASAP!!"
3,Just OK,"This product was just average due to it's shipping and instructions. This machine is supposed to come with different cleaners and polishing cloth. However, they are not shipped together and I had to call back to get the cleaners. The machine is worthless with out them. It took nearly 3 weeks to get all materials necessary to use this product. Additionally, the instructions are vague and don't give good direction on how to clean all types of jewelery."
2,Unhappy reader,Trite and transparent. Political views disguised as fiction. I expected a lot more from the McGoldricks. Never again.
4,"Nice book, interesting","MattieI did enjoy this book. It is well written and the characters well-formed. The story kept me reading, wanting to know how it would end, but I wasn't crazy about the ending. All in all, however, it is an interesting and worthwhile read."
4,Mattie review,Couldn't put the book down. So interesting to see what a female doctor went through in the 1800's & how she over came her upbringing & poverty.
3,Mattie,Good narrative . Descriptive of the times and the difficulties of women trying to venture into jobs thought if as men's . Just not my favourite reading.
3,"Nice Read, but Nothing Spectacular","This was well written and the story was good, however, it seemed like there were 2 authors who wrote this book. Parts of it were very immature writing style while other parts were professional. It felt like the author was getting weary of the story so decided to end it rather bluntly. Good light reading, but definitely not a best seller."
5,Great Book,I liked this one because I felt it defined the stgruggles of woman breaking into the medical field and went they went through.
3,so-so.,I wonder if some of these titles are written just for kindle books It's a thought provoking subject but I did not think too well written.
5,Enjoyable Read,"This was a very enjoyable story. It fit the bill for a nice read for the weekend - not too heavy, not too light."
3,mattie,"it was a good read, not exciting but a good read. It was pretty predictible but still a good story"
3,Mattie - Hard to read with all of the hyphenated words,"The story is good, but there are too many hyphenated words in the middle of a line. More care should have been taken when transferring it to Kindle."
5,very much worth the read,"It took a while to really get too interested in this book,but once I did get interested it was hard to put the book down. Mattie shows just what a determined woman can accomplish."
3,Mattie,"An enjoyable night stand read, One can put it down and pick it up without a glitz. Quite inspirational, the author shines through in her narration.A huge gap from her last fleeting relationship and an adult unexplained protege. Much was left unsaid and the end was very disappointing."
3,Hardships,This woman.had a life full of ups and does in a world that was a raw rough time She accomplished a lot in her time
5,This book is essential,"In plain English, the author guides his readers through discovering our governing American Document. This book carefully describes and explains how powers and laws of the Constitution balance each other giving us an unprecidented guiding theme to our democratic government. Readers of all sophistications will come away with fresh insight into our sucessful and complex governing system."
5,Ray Barretto + Adalberto Santiago= A winning combination.,"""Quitate La Mascara"" and ""De Que Te Quejas Tu"" are truly timeless ""Salsa Dura"" jams that shall forever prove the greatness of legendary Puerto Rican sonero Adalberto Santiago. Ray's band is at its best on this album and complements Adalberto perfectly. Although Adalberto would join Tipica 73 shortly after this album was released both he and Ray would reunite on the equally suberb 1979 set ""Rican/Struction"". Buy both CDs now if you don't yet have them!!!"
4,Nice,"There is some very nice timbale work on Power, a fusion heavy-funk number. The rest is Barretto classic material. Quitate la Mascara is a serious, serious smoker."
5,The historical context of christian anti-intellectualism,"Unfortunately, reasoning and thinking skills of this quality are not to be found in contemporary pop authors. This book touches on many things, but foremost it is a linear logical critique of the ideas and doctrines of men in a historical context. Clark moves through history with a critical eye on faith and saving faith exposing the lack of logic and clear thinking on the part of specific individuals in regards to saving faiths definition. His position is one in which, to believe propositions (facts) about someone is to believe in them. There is no more to it than that. Thus, rendering the concept of easy believism empty and meaningless. Also, it's a sort of prophetic warning against the descent of popular christiandom into anti-intellectualism, which at this point is an established reality. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to enlarge their understanding of these issues."
4,Not as pictured,Your picture of this rings shows blue sapphires so I was disappointed to see that the ring I received has such dark stones that they appear black. The ring is definitely NOT as advertised.
4,OnWard and UpWard!,"While I've just learned of this book, I applaud the writer for investing time on the subject of Victoria Woodhull. She was the first woman to run for US President in 1872. However, she believed in ""free love"" not in the practice of sexual encounters but defined as ""once one falls out of love with their respective lover or husband, one should be free to explore other love relationships."" If Woodhull had encountered the sexual liasions some writers have penned, she would have fallen to the social sexual diseases and unwanted pregancies.I recommend anyone interested in Victoria Woodhull to watch the first and only documentary, America's Victoria, Remembering Victoria Woodhull. Captivating and revealing interviews include feminist icon, Gloria Steinem. Woodhull's own words are spoken by actress Kate Capshaw. A new DVD to be released in 2006."
5,Not environmentally friendly but also don't burst with heavy loads.,"The 3 mil thickness makes all the difference as compared to the 1.1 mil bags you typically pick up in a convenience store. Usually, I would pick this up at a Hardware store but Amazon Prime gives me free shipping on this bulky item (I don't understand how they can make much money on such items) and therefore saves time."
4,"Cerebral, Vulgar, and Funny","Doug Stanhope puts out a consistently off beat style of comedy. The set featured on this album lives up to the standards of his previous efforts. Doug Stanhope is a different kind of funny, kind of like watching someone beat the hell out of a Mime. His Humor is not as deep as a guy like Dennis Miller, but requires more thought than a guy like Chris Rock. I think anyone who enjoys Lewis Black, Joe Rogan, or any of Doug's previous albums will get a laugh out of this CD. If you're easily offened this CD probably isn't for you, if you have a good sense of humor and can laugh at something because it is a joke, this album is a decent buy."
5,THE must-have CD this Christmas season!,"I am stunned that other reviewers have left negative comments for Aimee Mann's fabulous new Christmas CD, which I believe is a thoughtful, fun, exquisitely done album! The songs range from pensive and melancholy to spry and fun. And don't most of us experience that combination of emotions around Christmastime?I am crazy about Mann's remake of ""You're A Mean One, Mr. Grinch"" and her lilting version of ""Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas"" (a song many artists slow to a snail's pace). But all the recordings here are wondrous in their respective ways.Love, love, love this CD! This would be a great gift for anyone who enjoys Aimee Mann's music or ""alternative""-sounding Christmas music."
4,Very nice Christmas collection,"If you love Aimee Mann and you love Christmas music, then this is a great album for you. I happen to love both, so I'm happy with this collection.BUT...The reason I bought this was because of one song that I've heard a couple times on XM radio: ""Christmastime"". It's an amazing duet with Aimee Mann and Micheal Penn. This husband and wife literally make beautiful music together. However, the duet that I've been hearing on the radio isn't the one included with this album. The version of Christmastime on this album is really great, but it wasn't what I was looking for. My appetite was already whetted for the other version.But aside from my pouting over not getting the one song I wanted, this really is a great Christmas album. Aimee Mann's vocal treatment of these Christmas songs is right on point. She's amazing. Even without Michael Penn. ;)"
5,pure delight,"This album is pure delight; it's truly fascinating, moving, sweet and delicious; it's a very good Christmas collection."
4,Jew Review....,"OK..I'll start off by saying I'm not a Christian and I bought an X-Mass CD... But Calling on Mary was worth the Price alone. Aimee Mann has set the bar VERY high with her past albums, so it is hard for this album to come close. The Stand out track is ""Calling on Mary"", with it's hook that proves Mrs. Mann is still a master song-smith. Great CD for a holiday gift as there are enough standards for the ""non-Aimee"" fans to get them listening to the Artist the rest of us know and love. Album gets approval from this Jew! :)"
3,Another Artist does an OK Christmas CD,"Well, to me this CD is OK to good, the first few songs are slow and to me, kind of sappy sounding for Aimee Maan, I kind of chuckle at the lyrics of the first 3 as they sound too, cliche. But, the reason for the CD is the next 4 songs, The Grinch version is one of the most unique renditions ever, I love it, and the rest of the CD is good, but this does have about 4 real clunkers, and this is for sure a mood type, as a darker feel to it. I would recommend it, but I would not pay more than say $6 for it. To me it does not have that Christmas Music that you must play a lot type of quality, it is just a kind of quirky mood style that will offset any other Holy - Jolly Christmas music you have in your collection."
4,good addition to Christmas music,"This is an excellent, not so typical, Christmas CD that I think anyone can enjoy. I especially enjoyed the Mr. Grinch cover."
2,DISAPPOINTING,"I'm disappointed with this album which lacks of originality.I must confess that I hate Christmas, so it's a bit hard for me to appreciate the songs, although this is Aimee's voice.Trying to be objective, the songs lack of emotion, Aimee is not convincing at all (execpt perhaps for ""Mr. Grinch"") and the overall is boring.That's a shame because ALL the previous albums were great. This one must be forgotten."
2,"Dull, Uninspired Effort",I was excited to buy this release as I'm a big Aimee fan. My initial reponse upon first listen was that it was boring and uninspired. Aimee sounds as if she swallowed a few valiums prior to recording. The arrangements are equally lacking. Not much here to get excited about. Very disappointing.
2,One great song and . . .,"Sorry to be negative, I really like Aimee Mann's music. ""Calling on Mary"" show's her creativity, talent, and brillance. Unfortunately, the other nine songs are safe interpretations of Christmas classics. I was hoping for something more daring and fresh."
5,Probably Good,"What is the name of book three? I haven't read this book yet, but I am sure I will like it. I like all the books by Chris Platt. When is book three going to be published?"
3,"Go, King, Go!",This book was even better than Willow King and I didn't think that could be possible! It's realistic and is written by a real Jockey so it's no wonder I could feel my own feet in the irons. Katie Durham is a true hero who shows real mettle in this unputdownable novel.
5,Musique de Bois - Outstanding,"This album, along with ""Souvenirs"" are two of Phil Woods' finest albums. Song selection is excellent and Phil is at the height of his powers. Phil's speed on Aregin is just amazing. Furtive pops from Phil's sax show a fun and wonderous mastery of his instrument. This Japanese Pony Canyon remastering is just much more alive than the original. More silence in backgrounds. More sizzle from cymbals. The bending and decay of bass notes. Ah, Phil cooks. A must have for the Phil Woods fan."
4,overall good but a bit slow for me,"I have owned my Toshiba Satellite 1905 s303 since December 2002. I have not had to many problems with it. As mentioned in some other reviews it started to shut down at random. I found the problem was it was over heating. To fix it just use pressurized air to blow out the cooling fan and fins area, too much dust was on the cooling fins. Because I have more powerful computers it seems a little slow, but it has plenty of power for most people."
3,OK but not great. Good deal for the money.,"I had 1600 allowance for a new laptop so I got the 1905-S303. Powerfull processor, lots of memory, nice screen.... a good value overall. However it has some major drawbacks: Very heavy and bulky. Would not fit in my old case. No PS2 support, you have to buy a USB mouse and keyboard. No support for a port replicator or docking station. I think I should have got the HP ze5185."
1,"Very poor Toshiba, I will not buy this Brand!!",This damn machine alway crash without any warning and cannot boot after that. I have to try all the ways to cool it (including with ice!!) to make it boot again. Strongly against this damn machine.
5,Just A Bit Heavy...,I did research for months before I went about getting my Toshiba Satellite 1905-S303. I had a early Toshiba Satellite a few years ago and this definately a great series of computers. My only complaint is this computer is a bit heavier then some others I looked at which is going to be difficult when I start hauling it around the campus next semester. With the features offered on thie machine however I'll be able to live with it.
5,Earth Lazer Walking Shoes,These walking shoes are so light and comfortable. They fit perfectly. I love them and would recommend them to anyone who enjoys walking and comfortable feet!
3,"Love this shoe, makes you stand up straight","This is a very comfortable shoe. It took a little, I mean very little, getting used to but very worth it. And, not as ugly as the Earth shoes of 30 years ago. Very comfortable. Large toe box, as is obvious!"
2,Poor arch support,While the Earth Lazer is a lite weight shoe and free of animal materials it has poor arch support. There is virtually no lateral arch support and there is no heel cup support. The negitive heel causes to much stretch for the foot and ankle. I would not recommend these shoes to anyone. I think the Birkenstock brand has a great deal more arch support for the entire foot and ankle and keeps the foot in a neutural position.
1,"DON'T BUY IT, don't repeate my mistake!","Let me start by mentioning that it is 10 years old. I started playing with Linux just few months ago. Someone told me that ""red hat"" is the most important Linux to learn because it is most used by businesses. Well, this ancient piece of junk wouldn't even install on my two years old laptop and, as I learnt it later, has nothing in common with current version of ""Red Hat"". I was really furious, why this outdated trash that is not compatible with today's hardware is still offered? It is no longer supported, not even longer documented!I browsed forums and some kind person enlightened me. Don't buy this. It will not work. Get any of modern Linuxes (Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian etc) instead! Look on other reviews they all are from 2002! I can't remember whom I dated that year!"
4,it's not perfect but it's nice,Well I love everything about this release however how do you edit the menus? I have a problem with how redhat made up the menus but everything else I can't really find any problems with and enjoy using it. Now when the heck is amazon.com gonna ship it to me?? it's been out for 3 days now!
2,Pretty Is As Pretty Does,"This new version of Red Hat Linux is somewhat more user friendlythan earlier versions--the desktop is attractive--but there areproblems. You still have to enter your root password to simplylog onto the internet and then, once you do, the status tabdisappears somewhere on the panel. There really is no easy wayto change the configuration either. Also, there's no ""Red HatConfiguration Panel"" either to check mount points, or changevarious configurations. I'd love to like Red Hat, but MandrakeLinux offers the most user friendly version by far."
1,I didn't know Microsoft bought out Red Hat.,"I have been a loyal Red Hat fan since 7.1. I upgraded to 7.2 and then 7.3 and was very impressed by the improvement that I saw. I recently installed 8.0 on my computer and am a bit ticked off. 8.0 is a huge leap backward. For those who say that the installation is a miracle from God, it's not, it's the same. There are several things lacking in 8.0 that were there in 7.3: DVD Player, Mpeg Player, MP3 playback. What are they thinking? Devices that should be working by now still don't: PDA's, Scanners, Webcams. Not to mention print quality for most printers is pathetic. (If you can get your printer to work) You no longer have the choice between KDE and Gnome. You get Bluecurve. Bluecurve is nice and all but does not make up for the loss of applications. Stick with 7.3. This is the kind of [junk] we expect from Microsoft, not Red Hat."
1,Paid for Redhat but recieved LinuxWerks,"The ad stated Redhat Linux 8.0 'used'When I recieved the shipment I found4 CD's in the package from LinuxWorks.com""Just like Redhat 8.0"". List price $...and $...shipping. Had I wanted to orderLinuxWerks, thats what I would have done.I have also had problems with the copy I recievedDisk 1 doesn't check or install properly."
5,Like wearing the stars on your neck...,"This pendant is AMAZING. I cant tell you enough how that photo does NOT do this large pendant any justice. Its a NICE weight. Its pretty big too! Not too big, but big enough to to be the focal point of your necklaces if you layer. Beautiful enough to just be worn alone a a simple gold snake chain. The bail is thick and big and attached.. This pendant is like a geode..the middle is carved out of the main stone and sparkeles like no diamond could. The stone above is gorgeous too. Its truly so stunning i cant stop staring! Im mystified and so happy with this pendant! New favorite and a definate heirloom."
3,DVD,A wonderful Christmas Movie even if you do not speak Spanish.And it was not on cable this year for some reason?
1,A quick return,"I bought these for a birthday present and was sadly disappointed (as was the birthday girl) They are cut like hospital scrubs and had a very stiff feel to them. The seams were also exposed and rough. They did come in a cute bag according to my wife, but she had me return these as soon as she took them out of the bag."
3,Disappointing,The liquorice taste is not prevelant on the pallet with this tea. I bought it because I was trying to capture the Aveda liquorice peppermint tea but this is not even close!
3,very earthy tea,"I grew up with blackberry tea and was excited to get this. It was very earthy tasting so I was disappointed. May be tasty to some, but I guess I had something else in mind."
1,Microsoft needs to explain,"I bought Microsoft Links 2003 and combat flight sim 3 with out reading reviews and the reviews are right, these games are flawed and a waste of money. They are turning out games that are not as good as the past. I am done with Microsoft games unless I read plenty of reviews that give it a thumbs up. It seems that Microsoft would address all these complaints but I see nothing. Are they laughing too hard at the consumer they once again have baffled?"
5,The Best Golf Game I have Ever Play,"This is a game I will have for years. With the ability to add additional courses, play online, and make the play as difficult as your skill level, Links 2003 is about as good as it gets. The courses are beautiful, and well designed. If you are hooked on a game being linked to a big name golfer, this isn't your game. If you are looking for superior play and graphics, this is your game.Any game that can make me angry and I keep comming back for more abuse because it is so fun is a keeper."
4,Trent Summar,"I had never heard of this guy until Amazon sent me a suggestions e mail, I listened to the clips of music and decided to buy this one, its not what one would call traditional country in fact its very rockabilly, I had to play it a couple of times to get into the music, out of all the tracks there is only one I do not like so for a guy I had never heard of its a good start ."
5,The Shape of Shapes.,"This is truly a great group. Ollestad adds an unusual depth to the group and the lead piece ""Arc of Twilight"" is an enchanting, unusual song. The slide trombone run in ""Love for Sale"" has the flavor of yesterday instrumental jazz runs - its great. All in all its an outstanding group. Good luck to Roger Burn and the rest of the folks."
2,Way too expensive!!!!,Bought two of these batteries in summer of 08. It is summer of 11 now and both are needing replaced. Don't buy the long service life claim. They have no longer service than regular sealed batteries.
1,Black & white coloring book?,"The pictures inside the book are actually just inked traces, it resembles a coloring book. Makes the objects and writing so much less visible.Paper is quite thin and so is the book itself. Cheap & not effective.compared to other Picture word books I have, this has fallen very short of the expectations, not very useful"
3,Busy but packed with info.,"I agree with some other reviewers that the pages are VERY busy, but I would not say that is bad for all toddlers. My son is 22 months old and would not have a problem with it. I haven't used the book much yet simply because I don't know how to pronounce all of the words. I bought an Italian language set with a CD that I'm hoping will help with that. I'm looking forward to reading the book regularly with my son."
2,Elementary and incomplete,"If you're looking for an ""encyclopedia"" of this topic, save your money. There's more left out than included. Disappointed."
3,artistically great; flawed package,"This cd has 20 tracks, with AR backed by guitars. Actually, about a half dozen or so of the tracks are instrumental only. The quality of the recordings is not good - the producers have done little to clean them up. The liner notes only give a brief bio of AR, and for the tracks just the title, composer, and length. No information on recording dates other than to say they are ""her first recordings, dating from 1945..."" It's obviously a budget disc - you get what you pay for!I am new to fado, so I can't comment as to the historical or artistic significance of these ""first recordings."" Still, the beauty and passion comes through. I would look for a cleaner recording first, though."
2,Poor Calibration - Off Center Casting,"I cannot justify a positive review for this product. I had high hopes and was looking forward to receiving it. I needed it for torquing the many small bolts on my transmission pan and knew that accuracy was important.As for the wrench, I'm currently in an automotive college and compared this Neiko Pro 1/4 inch with several almost new high dollar torque wrenches. The bottom line - this Neiko tightens bolts almost twice as tight as it is registered.Also, the circular head of the wrench was not cast straight. The Neiko wrench was angled about 5 degrees off. I returned it to Amazon and received a full refund. I suggest you pick a different torque wrench."
5,Perfect for New Estheticians Too,"This DVD is not only great for established estheticians as another reviewer commented, it's perfect for us newbies too. Unfortunately my ""school"" didn't teach me a thing about waxing so I had to learn everything on my own. This DVD gave me the knowledge and confidence to begin offering waxing services safely and perfectly in almost every situation I've encountered. Highly recommended."
4,An entertaining and slightly humorous exploration.,"In this book the author describes his travels through ghost towns. In describing the areas, the author explains the directions and difficulties that were endured getting to the actual site. There is history about the towns and the author also notes the cause of a towns' demise. There are wonderful anecdotes from old-timers and some humorous tales of the author's travels. It is a book that makes for good reading, but not one that may be easily referred to during traveling, so reading and taking notes or marking pages is helpful. There are descriptions of the roads, but not all directions are clear whether some of these roads are accessible without a four-wheel drive vehicle. Many good photographs, but all pictures are in black and white. It does however make this reader want to get off the couch to travel and explore."
4,"Great info, a little out dated now",Excellent history on the Places it did cover. Pictures and Humor along the way. The author strives to tell a story for each area and did a good job in tying the history of some towns together.
4,"wonderful, but dated","This book is a really wonderful guide to the ghost towns of the Northwest. The writing is entertaining and informative, including some accounts with ""current"" locals--and the pictures are great. The sole reason for not giving the work a 5 of 5 is that it is a bit dated; the current state of these locations are not what they were when the work was published in 1971. Some of these towns have disappeared entirely since the author's visit, reclaimed by nature or the land owners where the properties once sat, and other towns have undergone revitalization, making them a lot less ghosty.However, as far as history, story telling and a black & white glimpse of northwest ghost towns, you won't find many guides better than this."
2,Nothing Compared To The Toshiba Satellite 1955-S803,"My friend has this laptop because when I got the 1955-S803 he got this 5205-S703. You have to be an owner to realize how good the 1955-S803 really is. This only has a 15"" monitor while the 16"" really helps out when computing around the web or playing a game on the nVIDIA Graphics with 64 MB. 60GB is very good especially for a 2002 notebook PC. Battery life sucks so badly because I've had it for 2 years and now for some reason the battery only lasts for like 45 minutes! This notebook does have okay battery life. This also has a DVD-Burner which doesn't exsist in the 1955-S803. Both have Windows XP Home Edition. Both are Pentium 4 but the 1955-S803 has a P4 2.49 GHz Processor (It does have WiFi) while this has a P4 2.0 GHz Mobile Processor. This also is lighter weight at about 8 pounds and the 1955-S803 is about 10 pounds. I really love my Toshiba 1955-S803 but if you want this I really don't care."
1,Simply put it is as boring as can be !!!,"It is a huge book but the content is boring, I suggest looking elsewhere for an informative and interesting biography ."
1,DO NOT BUY GOVIDEO,"DO NOT BUY ! GOVIDEO portabld DVD player breaks after limited use and this company should be called NOGOVIDEO. You will have absolutely no customer service, you might receive a reply by e-mail if the feel like it and no one answers the phone unless you are willing to be on hold for 15 to 20 minutes or more. STAY AWAY FROM NOGOVIDEO !"
2,Few Craft Stick Projects,NOT WORTH PURCHASING. Over priced for what little it has to offer. Too simplistic. A poor excuse for a craft stick project book.
1,too small,they're a bit smaller than the size chart says. Can't return them either... Guess I better lose some weight. They're well put together though. I have ordered some XL's that are really comfortable and durable.
1,Don't Buy It!!!,I bought this CD thinking it had great songs performed by great artists. Instead it contains covers of those great songs by people who kind of sound like the original artists. It stinks!
5,Truely exhilerating,This book is one of my favorite books ever. Its historical accuracy and intrieging love story are truely amazing. I have read this book three times and enjoy it the same if not more each time I read it. Mrs. Chaikin is my favorite Christian author and has influenced my life greatly through her many fabulous novels. I check the shelves at my local book store weekly for a new book. Thank-you. She has made many dull study halls at school come to life with her adventures.
5,excellent,This is the most captivating book! To follow Emerald through her struggles and finally realize who she loves. this book is exceptionally well written. Linda Chaiken makes it seem as if you are right there in the middle of the action.
4,Like you needed another reason to buy this CD!,"As if Spring Hill Fair weren't reason enough to buy this...you also get the bonus CD with lots of extras. The bonus CD contains a lot of great rarities. Some outtakes, a rare instrumental track ( where did that come from?), a B-side, and a track from the 1978-1990 best of thats no longer available here. Normally this extra stuff is marginalia at best and not worth the extra cash, but not this time. You get some great new songs that stand up next to any of their best. If you don't already have Spring Hill Fair then this is an offer you can't refuse. If you already have it then the bonus disc is really worth the extra money. ""Newton told me"" is already my favorite. Did I forget to mention the video of Bachelor kisses."
4,Saul's most personal thriller?,"Punish the Sinners is a thriller concerning a rash of suicides and religious fervor sweeping through a desert community (the heat is symbolic on many levels). On another level I think it is a very personal book for Saul, usually a very impersonal and highly structured writer. This is due to the tensions regarding sexual orientation issues with the lead adult characters. Highly recommended."
4,Really good.,"This is the first novel I have read from Saul and I admit I was impressed. From the first page it hooks you in and keeps you there. The ending was not typical and much of a surprise. Overall really good book, along the lines of Stephen King novels, which have that eerie and mysterious flavor to them that make them such good thrillers. I look forward to reading more of John Saul's work."
3,7 out of 10,Not too bad. A good sophomore effort for Saul. Evil priests have a special place in my heart. A few scenes could have been spiced up and made more interesting. It could have had a better ending as well. It seemed as if Balsam just gave up.--author of The Shadow God and Spiritual Sorrow
2,"Shoots high, hits low","Punish the sinners delivers an interesting but ultimately unsatisfactory suspense story centering around a Catholic school in a small town. While the story initially raises some interesting questions about theology and Catholic doctrine, Saul eventually forsakes those topics completely in the pursuit of a ridiculously far-fetched tale of obsession and mind-control. There is literally no character development whatsoever, and Saul goes a step worse in drawing on multiple character stereotypes: the sinister priest, the disbeleiving psychologist, the popular jock, the picked-on ""ugly girl,"" and more. If Saul had done anything memorable with such characters, it might be worthwhile, but this is simply unacceptable. To top off the frustration, the ending is simply atrocious, and does nothing to conclude the story; it feels like a bad horror movie where the killer is still alive at the end (though that is somewhat of a recurring theme in Saul's work). Not recommended at all."
1,Horrible,"I'm not sure if the other reviews are meant to be jokes or what, but John Saul is perhaps the worst hack writer I've ever read (or listened to, in this case). He does start the stories pretty well, but the wheels don't just come off the wagon, they fly off at light speed! Relaxation therapy? The musty odor of semen? Monsignor's huge organ? The characters are as flat as a postcard and the plot is outlandish and not just improbable but ridiculous.Someone please explain to me why 1)Balsam would have ever chosen to stay on in the first place considering the treatment he recieved from the beginning and 2)why would the Society choose this guy when there had to be a zillion other weaker-minded types they could have recruited to drizzle their, uh... religious fervor... all over."
3,Slow to start,"The book takes too long to get started. The first book (The Saints of Neilsville) plods along with a laughable predictability. The second book (The Society of St. Peter Martyr) picks up the pace and things really start to get creepy and strange. This section unfortunately relies too heavily on descriptions of all sorts of sexual acts. I'm not sure if I should laugh or be insulted. The two books take the plot on an unexpected tangent. Just as things seem to be petering out (excuse the pun), it picks up speed with the same frantic pace of some Stephen King novels. The last twenty pages then take a huge and wonderfully surprising tangent, earning this book a higher review than I otherwise would have given it."
2,"Some books age well, others don't","This was definitely in the second group. A long, slow build up to basically nothing, no mystery, no resolution, nothing more horrific than a secret undercurrent of homosexuality in the Catholic Church (imagine that!). Writing is at best completely unremarkable, but often clumsy and repetitive. Why is this book still in print?"
4,Fantastic with spare efficient storytelling contrasting with intense horror.,"Ashley Greene looks phenomenal in a casual style in this film - much better than she does in Twilight where she wears weird baby doll shirts and just looks stiff.So here we have this very cute and very pretty young female hitching in what is obviously suburban/rural Canada (Canada just has a look). She seems to be able to take care of herself and ends up spending the night with a pretty boy stranger who turns out to be a serial killer with a killing room in his basement. And his mother is fine with it.It's all about Ashley surviving a family of sickos including the patriarch played by Rosemary's Baby - yeah, Lucifer, Prince of Lies, Stephen McHattie himself who like John Glover is a standout at playing evil and scary.In my opinion, this movie is well worth watching."
2,No so good .......,"Well i have to agree with most here , this movie is average at best & i like cheesy B-type horror films , this one just really does not go anywhere , it's missing so much ...... The story just does not work at all , most of the acting is average , i guess the Only reason to see this would be if you were an Ashley Greene fan , she looks great & her acting is good considering what little she has to work with , that would be pretty much the only reason to see this , maybe give it a rental if you must , but remember i can't give you back your 90 minutes of life you lose ."
2,booooooring,I fast forwarded through half the movie..if you want to get some sleep I suggest watching thisrepetitive slow moving dialog-laden flick:)
4,Shining a Light on Utilities,"This was as a reading assignment for a sustainability elective I took during my MBA. It is an historical account of developments in the utility industry in the U.S. during the 60's, 70's and 80's, from the persepctive of the author, who had first hand involvement. His account gives some interesting insight into how publlic utilities are managed and often mis-managed."
3,why do they do that,"why do redhat upgrade there os so often,that's a minus factor compared to windows.repacking with fancy new box wont one time redhat buyerscomeback. like me. they gotta show us why and where weneed it not just for servers but games mutimedia and internet.linux is getting too big too soon a bad sign for arelativeely young os. igive three stars becausethere are new users who needs it and will definitelylove it. let's frag M$."
4,Sure Fire Theater,"This play is odd in that critics hate it, but theater companies love it. Harold Bloom's contempt for this play is so great that he refused to discuss it in his book on Shakespeare. But, unlike some of Shakespeare's less popular plays, Merry Wives is performed frequently in Shakespeare festivals across the land.You really have to see this play to understand how well it works on the stage. Played by an energetic cast it is hilarious situation comedy and easily understandable by people unfamiliar with Shakespeare. When Falstaff says at the end, with deadpan delivery, ""I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass,"" it brings down the house. Just reading the play in your living room, you will probably miss much of the humor.Shakespeare was a man of the theater. He wrote for production, with little thought given to publication in his lifetime. You have to see his plays performed to get a measure of his theatrical genius."
1,Big Band Jazz,"Very,seldom you hear Tex Beneke with strings, it sounds great, a favorite sone ( Oh Lady Be Good ) there was a terrfic trumpet solo in this song. Over all I love every song played there especially ( To Each His Own ) now that is really a beautiful song. A worthwhile big band jazz CD to keep."
2,A disappointing book!,"This book has been in my wish list for quite some time, and I had such high hopes for it. It was a major disappointment. Gabriel was sexy, but self centered and a jerk. Lizzie was an 'ordinary' girl. That's what the author referred to her as. 'Ordinarily pretty', 'somewhat pretty', 'plain'. And, every character in this book hated Lizzie's 'horrible' red hair. The romance between the two was mediocre. All in all, not the best by Anne Stuart!!!!"
5,Excellent Book,"This is an excellent book: clear, easy to understand presentation, good choice of topics covered, a lot of sample program codes, very few errors. This is the best programing book I have ever read.Xiaolong Wu"
3,"Good all around examples, but there are better ways.","This book is great for beginning to intermediate level VB developers. However, for more experienced people, this book lacks depth. There are no examples of RDO, ADO. Certainly, not enough of Class/object based programming examples."
5,For the experienced programmer: BUY IT,This is as close as it gets to being able to take a pill and know everything you need to know about VB 5 the next morning.
4,One of the Better VB5 books,"This book is a great resource, logically presented, and readable. I recommend it for someone with some VB background who wants to accelerate to the more advanced topics and be guided through the topics. The author chose a nice variety of topics and all are covered thoroughly. The book is 'old' in VB terms (1997) and uses Office 95 references for Activex Automation. That's the only weakness I found."
3,Good Intro to VB,"This is a good introduction to Visual Basic 5.0. However, this book does not cover RDO and gives a very shallow description on DAO. I had to resort to help window on VB to learn about database programming."
1,just look for another book,"Huge amount of missprints in code samples, some code samples contain errors, which cannot be interpreted as missprints.Chapter about variable scope does not have all essential information. Chapter about database is primitive and rudimentary.CD does not contain what was promised. Is not that already enough? I want my money back!!!"
5,Just what she wanted,"The sales lady at Wal Mart laughed at me when I asked if they had it. Well, I got it here. It is just what my daughter wanted. She loves it."
5,Beautiful Gift!,I gave this to my aunt as a gift b/c she loves Care Bears so much. She was more than happy! This is a wonderful collectible item.
4,Good Value for the Price,"I was quite impressed with this item, when I couldn't find it anywhere I could find it at AMAZON - and the price compared to where I had seen it previously was much better!"
4,Great Teaching Tool,"The Ultimate Panoramic Atlas is a great teaching tool. I have just become aware of this book in the last few months and want it for my fifth grade classroom. It provides an expansive view of the earth that children need to understand the placement and formation of continents and islands. It also provides vivid illustration of volcanoes, their locations, and the effects they have on landforms. Much of the mystery of the ocean depts is revealed too. This is a great geogrphay teaching aid."
4,Compelling story of tragic period in history,"I read this book while in and returning from Tasmania. I found it to be a much better insight into the history and mentality of Australia than any tour/travel planner I read. It has survived the test of time because it is so accurate in its portrayal of the penal transportation system. It also serves to show that the recent tragedy at Port Arthur Tasmania is minor and almost insignificant if it is compared to what the ""civilized"" british empire performed at the same location"
3,Not the Best,"David ""Lucky"" Starr infiltrates pirate-infested asteroids in a desperate bid to prevent galactic war. Not one of the better Lucky Starr books, albeit the only one grounded on astrophysical science with which Asimov still felt entirely comfortable after 25 years of additional observations. Asimov's concept of pirates based in the practically ungovernable asteroid belt has a ring of accuracy in the light of colonial Caribbean history."
1,NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE!,"This book is *not* the complete works of Alfred Tennyson! It is a very poor reproduction of an old book, page for page, except that half of the pages are too dark to be even remotely legible. It is literally a page-by-page scan of an old document. The publisher says on the inside of the book: ""This important reprint was made from an old and scarce book. Therefore, it may have deefects such as missing pages, erroneous pagination, blurred pages, missing text, poor pictures, markings, marginalia and other issues beyond our control..."" this is putting it mildly. The scans are quite literally unreadable. I find that there is no reason whatsoever to purchase this book and am very disappointed that Amazon posted no description so I was unaware of what I was actually buying."
3,review,"This book does a decent job describing and defining geometric concepts. The proofs are somewhat difficult, the examples are limited. The proofs for the most part are succinct, the exercises are fairly challenging in general. I just dont like how there are inconsistencies they show two column proofs on congruent triangles then on proofs of parallelograms, they dont have two column examples the examples just give it in paragraph written form, if they are going to say use paragraph, or two-column that would be nice. they expect the reader to assume. they cut a lot of corners, which is not the key to learning in my book, I give this book 3 stars."
4,great,"I bought this clock for a beach bathroom. It looks perfect, and I'm glad I bought it. The colors are bright, and the flip flops look hand-painted. However, after taxes and shipping, I paid $47-- I think that's a little high for the product."
5,WHAT MORE COULD YOU NEED FROM A MOUSE.,This cordless/optical mouse is a sweet buy. I was originally just going to get an wired optical but the cordless was not much more. Logitech makes a good product for the most part and this is no exception. The mouse never screws up like my old one. It has the same feel as a wired mouse once you set the sensitivity to your liking. The mouse is a great buy along with modern style. Upgrade to this one.
3,"A pretty good mouse, with one exception...","I like this mouse it does what a mouse should do, but I noticed when I started playing games again that things assigned to the scroll wheel don't work. It will zoom in and out like it's supposed to but anything that involves clicking the wheel doesn't work. At first I thought maybe I got a faulty one, but it works outside of video games.So if you play games on your computer I'd say maybe this mouse is not for you. But if not, I see nothing else wrong with it!"
1,Logitec Cordless Mouse,This mouse quit working after about a month. (New batteries didn't work.) Please forward instructions for return.
2,Antiquated design and a little bulky,"The design looks like it's quite old, and the size of the book is a little awkward for a receptionist's desk. I would expect a little better for that price."
2,T Fal Deep Fryer,"When I first purchased this item I was very impressed with it. It seemed to work great and it was very affordable. But upon using my fryer for the 5th time, oil started leaking out of it. I contacted Amazon and they said since it was an Amazon Merchant that I purchased the fryer from, I needed to ship it back to the return center (at my cost) and then wait for a 50 to 80% refund. I guess this is an acceptable remedy, but in the future, I will think twice before ordering from a merchant. To me, a 1 year warranty should be exactly that-1 year-100% refund or exchange. I am considering contacting T-Fal directly. I own lots of their products, and have never been disappointed until now."
1,Bad blades,"These blades were dull when I received them. I tried them anyway and the results were unsatisfactory.I checked my installation and it was correct.High vibration and rough finsh.The 1 reviewer was correct in their review.CMT is the brand of Router bits that I use, and they are perfect, so I went against the 1 review. Wrong decision.Can CMT give me any feedback?"
2,CMT Jointer Blades,bought these blades cuz my old ones had a knick in 'em and were pretty dull figuring I could drop these new ones in and I'd be back in business making chips. WRONG... these new blades we ground terrible. I spend more time resharpening and honing the new blades that I did touching up the old ones. Oh well
2,"Overblown, pretentious and overrated","There are three subplots in this novel that intertwines around the life of attorney Arthur Winner. Sometimes interesting, this book is a chore to read as Cozzen's style is, well, wordy and ornate.There is a scene where the central character and his sexually-repressed wife are in the sack (""Her."" ""Him"", ""Her"", ""Him."" )...the instructions on how to program my VCR were more stimulating. Give me a break.Maybe by today's overly PC standards this book could be considered mildly racist and bigoted, but I fail to see where. Catholics do take it on the chin, however.This was almost a good novel. John Cheever does this type of thing much better."
1,"Pretentious, bigotted, meaningless","My review reflects the summary I gave. Cozzens is a racial, nationalistic, religious bigot. He is a smug, pretentious writer. He does not improve with age. Book is worthless."
2,towel warmer,"I was very disappointed with the item itself. It was easy to assemble; however, the product does not get the towels warm as described in the product description. Delivery was on time. I would not purchase this item or from this manufacturer again."
2,Not ready for prime time!,"I bought this printer 2 weeks ago.I though it would be nice to print on my cds.While it does a great job printing,it is more trouble to keep running than any printer I have owned(50+).I have to run a head cleaning each day,since without doing so I have NO black!... Take a word of advice,go with [brand]!"
1,Don't buy this printer,"I bought this printerr in Dec. 2002 and have had few good pictures since. The printer leaves ink blobs on 2 out of 5 prints. I have to run the Clean Heads utility every other time I print and that doesn't always solve the problem. This makes printing expensive when one considers the wasted ink and paper. Also in addition to the ink blobs on pictures I am unable to buy replacement ink cartridges locally or on-line. I'm at my wits end, it really takes the fun out of printing photos.......... When I do get a clean picture, it is beautiful, but not worth the effort. This printer is also incrediably slow, much slower than I expected, but I could live with that if the finished product was blob-free. I have tried to contact Epson without any luck, they don't respond to my e-mails to their tec-support address."
3,"Good print, but problems","I love the output of Epson products. This printer had so many problems so quickly. I was really disappointed in the quality of the machine. The pump went bad about a day after the warranty expired. Had some other minor problems too. I cant say not to buy it, but it just irks me that everything made these days seems to be disposable."
3,Great Performance but poor logistics,"I was looking for high-end photo printer that I can print out my family photos. I intended to replace my 35mm camera with this printer and a digital camera.I am satisfied with this printer performance; printing resolution, dye inks (it lasts longer than common inks) and user interface software. But I am quite disappointed by its logistics.First, you can not buy those ink cartridges at shops around neighbors. The shops handling this ink cartridges are quite limited and sometimes, you can not find all colors, even at epson on-line shops.Second, you need genuine epson papers to print out photos. Third parties papers do not work. Finding epson papers are easier than finding 960's inks, though , this is another frustration.Overall, I am satisfied with the printer performance but the poor supply logistics deteriorate the usability of this printer. By this reason, I will buy Canon high-end printer next time."
5,Who says you can't print like the pros,"I own a Kodak PPM200 which I use to get 4X6 prints and the quality of the prints is OK. The quality of this printer is excellent and no one can tell this is an output of a home printer,though I have to admit for best quality prints you need to use the bit expensive Epson Premium Glossy Photo Paper but I have no problem in this as amazon offers the 50 pack ... for the qality you get you'll never regret it. One last think I have to say that I'm getting all of this with my 2.0 Mega S200 Canon camera. Imagine where I'll be with an EOS 10D or a Nikon D100. Just Imagine. Thank you Epson for this wonderful product."
2,Buy one of the other UFC DVD's!!!,"I have just starting following UFC closely and have been watching several of the UFC fights. After purchasing UFC 122 I felt a little ripped off when I found out that this was not a Pay-Per-View event but rather free to watch on Spike TV. Some of the fights were decent, but due to the fact it took place in Germany, many of the fighters were European, and fairly unknown."
5,One of the best investments I ever made,Compressor runs great. The nail guns are easy to use. This is a great set for a first time nail gun purchase. We live in a rural area and this compressor has come in very handy on several occasions. I keep the compressor along with a long extension cord in the back of my van. There are times when bumping along on the old back roads of Texas we have encountered air loss in the tires. Since the compressor will hold the air for a long time I keep it filled with air. Whenever I need air or run along a neighbor with a tire situation I am ready. Put this along with a tire air gauge and your jumper cables in your car or truck.
3,NOT as advertised,"this is NOT a three nail gun set as advertised--it is a two nailgun, one stapler set. this identical set is always available at home depot for less money. it is a great set and works well, but dont be deceived."
3,Decent value.... kind of a throw-away compressor,The nailers and stapler work well. Depth adjustment is pretty good. I've had virtually no problems with jams. The compressor on the other hand is noisy and didn't last me too long. The drain valve on the bottom began leaking fairly quickly. I still have the compressor but rarely use it anymore due to the leaking tank.
4,warranty clarification,"I don't own this one, but the last reviwer stated that the warranty forthis unit is one year VS the Bostitch 7 year warranty, but when i checkedit out, the Bostitch only cover the power fasteners for 7 year, the air compressor is still only has 1 year warranty, not 7 !"
3,"Good guns, bad compressor","This will be the third time I'm replacing the regulator on the compressor. Inside the regulator pressure adjustment knob is a plastic part that controls outlet air pressure. This part is fragile and keeps on breaking every few months as it ages or wears down as it's adjusted. Further, the compressor takes a long time to come up to pressure and is loud enough to wake the dead.Guns are pretty good, seldom misfires."
4,good customer service,"I bought this kit for the guns, which are quite nice. I did not expect much from the compressor. It is small, runs a lot when I am using the guns, but does the job. After I had had it for a month, I had an issue with the compressor leaking air. I called CPO and they immediately sent me a new kit and arranged for FedEx to ship back the old one at their expense. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the service. I would deal with CPO again."
1,Oil-free = designed to break down,"This deal seemed to good to be true. I've owned 2 of these little units now, and to be fair - they both worked great for a year to two years. THEN, when you need them most - they break down, and because they are ""oil-free,"" they are sealed and unfixable.So if spending $300 every 1-2 years is what you want to do - keep buying these. Otherwise you're wasting your money."
1,Weird Smell,"I received this bag as a gift (I had put it on my Amazon wishlist) and it is PERFECT for my needs (gym bag with enough room for a change of clothes, two small towels, toiletries, hair dryer). I like all of the pockets, the size and design.. HOWEVER the bag smells TERRIBLE!!!! It smells so ridiculously musty that I can hardly stand using it. Ugh. I wish it didn't stink so bad and part of me wonders if this is why it was offered at such an incredible discount."
4,Great bag.,After reading the reviews I purchased this bag. It is great. Lots of room and nice size. The cup holder only fits a slimmer bottle which is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. The bag is great quality and I'm sure it will last a long time.
5,Perfect size and exceptional concepts,This bag is the perfect size for my wife. It holds everything in exceptionally well conceived compartments and still fits in the lockers at her gym. She couldn't be more pleased.
5,High Sierra Water Bottle Duffel,"This Is a well made gym bag,bottle included,many compartments.Zippered wet pocket for shoes or wet items.Made of strong material also has padded shoulder and grab handle."
2,Bad zipper slider,"On the top, U-shaped zipper, one of the two sliders came off after two months use. Otherwise, the bag is a nice size, has nice features, and has sturdy fabric."
4,Second time's a charm,"Updated 2013-02-09: I contacted High Sierra shortly after writing the original review. A new bag arrived after a few weeks. The replacement has held up well since, and the zipper is still attached. I'm giving it 4 stars (up from 3 originally) as a result. Maybe I just got unlucky the first time. Either way, High Sierra did the right thing.Original Title: Good while it lastedBought one of these in a retail travel store. The 'U' shape opening makes it very easy to access the main compartment and get things in/out. Mine saw light duty ~3x week as a gym bag after work and the roughly monthly weekend trip. The zipper came off in less than a year which was very disapppointing. Otherwise, the bag held up very well."
2,Too heavy and big for me,I should have tried it out in the store first. It's too large for a 5 foot 4 woman and always remember to empty the water bottle before taking it any where. I use it to bring work out gear to and from the office. Once even a third full its uncomfortable to carry the 5-6 blocks to the office.I will probably give it to my 6 foot brother. Its a good heavy bag though- just more serious than I need.
2,"Interesting clips, but not a good book","It took me a couple months to get through this book. Although there are many interesting clips [from the author's magazine interviews over the years], the book does not hang together. It appears that the author attempted to weave the stories together into some kind of themes, by decade: but there is really no ""greater insight"" provided. I would have preferred to read an anthology of more in-depth commentaries on a few female artists. I also found Ms. Hirshey's ornate writing style to be difficult reading."
4,love it,"I love this book. I enjoy Hirshey's writing and I like the way she humanizes these iconic women. If you're looking for an encyclopedic recounting of the facts regarding recording dates and the correct spellings of collaborating artists, this book may baffle you. Like a rock and roll artist, Hirshey lays out her impressions, thoughts, and explanations with no other purpose but to please herself with the crazy, mixed up reality that is performance art. I think most avid listeners of rock and roll will get this and appreciate what Hirshey's accomplished with We Gotta Get Out of This Place."
3,"""I hate to think what that costume means, if it's a signal, Joe said""","While the book was very enjoyable it did not keep my attention as the other books in the series have. Chet and Biff, mistakenly identified as Joe and Frank Hardy, have been abducted. The Hardy Boys spend the book searching for them, but their searches are very repetitive. They begin in Northport, then to Shantytown, then home to Bayport, back to Shantytown, another clue leads them to Northport, they run back to talk to the sheriff in Bayport who in turn sends them looking for more clues in Shantytown, not to mention a couple of runs out to ""hermit island."" The mysteries they solve along the way are minimal and the supporting cast of friends, including their relatives, take on a very minor role compared to previous novels."
3,Your chumms will love it.,The Missing Chumms didn't quite get 5 stars but was still a masterpiece.In my opinion it is one of the best Hardy Boys books ever.It is nowhere near the best but is still one of the best.I know you and your chumms will love it.
3,Great but leaves LCD to be desired,"This is my right labtop that I've been searching for. But compared with Sony's VAIO, a compatible series to Toshiba, its LCD is a perfect flaw in a perfect pearl. It has relatively high resolution upto 1400 by 1050 (Toshiba says 1600 by 1200 in their online homepage but I did not suceed in getting that resolution) but also high reflection and poor view angles, giving totally different from desktop LCD or VAIO LCD. If you looking for labtops with good display, this is not the one...."
4,Great Laptop,"I bought this laptop as a desk top replacement. It is much too heavy for a lug it around on airplanes laptop.It has great features and will meet 90% of any super users requirements.On little nit: the keyboard and touch pad are awkward (I am used to the IBM keyboard and the pencil eraser ""mouse"") and I always seem to be moving the pointer when I don't want to. The touch pad is very sensitive even after resetting it.Buy it. it's a great machine."
1,Stay away from this laptop,First the computer has no bios. Bios allows you to adjust what is connected to your computer or even boot devices such as booting to cd rom to install a new OS. The only way to access the severely LIMITED bios is to insatll an os and Toshiba utility. VERY BADSecond the display is horrible. The black spaces between each pixel is visibly irriating. Pictures do not appear clear and look fuzzy. Especially annoying on a white screen such as Word. This is horrible!Third I attempted to install a 5400 rpm hard drive. The drive works in every other laptop except you guessed it this one. Apparently only Toshiba drives work in this machine and must have a SLAVE setting to operate.Fourth the usb will not auto detect my devices. I must manually go to device manager and force a scan for hardware changes.Stay away from this laptop....
5,Awesome laptop.,"How can anyone go wrong with the 5205. Got the machine primarily for software development installed Visual Studio .Net, Sql Server, Oracle, Adobe PhotoShop 7.0 and loads of other development tools and this machine runs everything without a sweat.If you are looking for a serious software development machine which will last you for years this is the best you could get.And the expandability is phenomenal.The screen is superb, speakers are great, RAM/HDD (5 stars for the money), the subwoofer is the best I have seen on a laptop.The quick TV output is great for presentations, and the remote very handy.Wireless networking worked in a snap.Would recommend this system highly for anyone looking for serious a development environment machine.TOSHIBA ROCKS!!!Toshiba service is top notch."
5,Comments from the Publisher:,"We apologize for the inconvenience. The book was corrected on May 18th, 2009. The new version has no omissions.MobileReference"
1,Shameful knock-off printing!,"I purchased the paperback from Amazon and am responding to the physical book I received, not the story. Beware! The ""product description"" is deceptive and very confusing. Presumably, the novel is out of copyright and has been reprinted (badly) by someone and that is what is being sold. The reprint has such terrible printing (tiny [10-pt?] type and huge [triple] linespacing between paragraphs) it is virtually unreadable. Perhaps it is a print-on-demand copy. Rightly so, no one claims to be publisher, only that it is ""made in Lexington, Kentucky."" I am returning it immediately. A shameful knock-off!"
4,"Not the best of Sayers, but interesting","If you are a Dorothy L. Sayers fan, this is an important piece of the Wimsey family history--particularly that of Lady Mary and Chief Inspector Parker. I had put off reading this and several other novels for a long time because (1) they didn't include Harriet Vane, and (2) I felt Sayers later works were better than her early stories. I still feel the latter is true, although that should not dissuade the reader from perusing these earlier mysteries.I give Clouds of Witness four stars only because five stars has to go to her crowning work Gaudy Night."
3,"ruthless analysis of a inefficient government,but not enough","A call for revolution talks about a crisis,that truly exists in the american government.Every crisis, have economical, social, and political bases Gross talks about just a face of this crisis that is the economical aspect of thi s problem.Although gross is harsh and show with great courage the truly nature of the ""government racket"",it is not enough.If a revolution is needed to prevent the wrongful and damaging work of washington,a book has to present a global crisis in all fields. Gross proposes to solve the Economical problem,not considering the Social, political implications.It is impossible to make a peaciful revolution using just partial solutions.It is impossible to make a peaciful revolution,because anger and unjustice required strong answers.The merit of Gross are all in his courageous attempt to struggle against unjustice,that must be the achievement of everyone who is interesting to destroy it ,in any way."
2,"Decent book, but flawed on some of the basics","This book has many decent ideas; some of which I agree with and some of which I disagree with. However, he gets some facts wrong; especially in the area dealing with Congress. For example, he says that the Majority and Minority Leaders are not elected by the people. This is a false statement. The Leaders are elected to the Congress by the people, and are installed in these particular positions by their colleagues. To make the claim he makes is misleading and false. He also provides no substantiation for other claims he makes. He says that there are party workers on the federal payroll. THis may or may not be true, but he provides no evidence to back up the claim, he merely makes it. The book has some good ideas, but taken as a whole it is deficient."
2,Not what I was expecting.,This game is nothing like the old style Larry games. Mini games distracts from the main goal of the game. It wasn't what I thought.
1,Horrid Game,The originals were so much more fun. I wish they'd get Al Lowe back. The mini games are super annoying and movement within the game is very difficult for someone not experienced with keyboard movement. After an hour or so of not enjoying the game I shelved it.
3,Not for kids,"This is a fun, adult game. The cutscenes are funny. The gameplay is repetitive, but the overall atmosphere is fun."
1,Bootleg and I want my money back,The game was a bootleg copy and from what I read from other people its not a complete bootleg it doesn't work in my pc it wont load up it wont even indicate its working and I know theirs something on there but I have no way of getting it I was under the assumption that it was the actual game but it wasn't it was a pirated copy witch is illegal and just plane wrong all I want is my money back just give me that and ill be happyP.S the positive feedback is probably just some one and or this person giving it
1,"Horrible, Horrible Game","I am a HUGE fan of the pre-Magna Cum Laude LSL series. If you've ever played any of the old games, you know that there's a bit of thinking involved in winning the game.Cum Laude, on the other hand, pathetically attempts to pose itself as an adventure game. Realistically, the producers/dorks behind the game obviously have little to no imagination or creative talent.The absolute worst part of the game takes place during the dialogue sequenses between Larry and other characters. Every time you have a conversation with someone, Larry talks while you navigate a sperm through an obstacle course of dookie (metaphorically speaking). In order to have a positive interaction with the other character, you have to navigate the sperm smoothly & not hit items along the way. It's funny at first, but then it's like, man, this is so dumb! What ever happened to picking out your character's dialogue from a list of possible statements?I gave the game one star, b/c the Quarters game is amusing."
3,game that you should rent,"This game is fun for about the first couple of hours...The storyline is good and clever, but the games are redundant and boring after awhile...overall this game is a renter but not something you should buy"
2,This is not your old Leisure Suit Larry,"One of the first games I played on my PC was Leisure Suit Larry I (and then II and III). These were played with the keyboard, and you had to type in commands.This latest incarnation has very little in common with the originals. Whereas the originals had some clever humour and puzzles, the new one is more of a mashing the buttons / get your timing down type of game. You will be chasing gold coins down for the most part.There just isn't enough to this game. The puzzles are very repetitive, and the control leaves a lot to be desired. Stay away from this one, unless you have a need to own every LSL title."
1,Rubbish,When I first saw this game on the shelves I almost did a back-flip. The memories it brought back! But what a dissappiontment.This game has virtually nothing in common with the originals.It is an adult game made for kids as you have to be lightning fast on the keyboard to play all the silly side games.The humour can be funny but to hear it all you have to be able to conquer these side games. As a 50 year old who enjoyed the LL series this game lacks imagination and I find my reactions too slow to be able to play this game.
1,Crappy PC Port,"Leisure Suit Larry had always been a fun, adult themed adventure game. It tested your wit and made you solve puzzles and much more.It also had a very good sense of adult humor, and even some mild nudity.This game, does not live up to the series. The entire game is nothing but a bunch of poorly done mini games, which compreses of pressing buttons in a certian order.What makes it worse, is its a direct game port from system to PC, which makes it even worse. The game support is very slim. My pc more then meets the MAX system requirments of the game, and it still ran poorly. Why? Because I didnt have a very specific video card.Unless your PC has the system requirements down to a letter, dont buy this game, there is no way to tweek the game performance, and unless you have the perfectly designed system for this game, it will run like crap.A horrible game, if your looking for digital T&A; just download a Hentai Game."
5,Great game.....not so great controllers,"This is one of the funniest games I haver played and would recomend it to anyone with a sense of humor and open minded about sex issues because that is what the game is about, teen sex.....But they really blew it with the controlo designs. Some of the mini games are almost impossible due to this. That issue set aside, I just love this game."
1,horrible at best,bad bad bad bad; want my $3 back; marg sucks in this one and i am a fan. did i mention it was really flipping bad1
2,Too Bad,"I used to be a huge fan of Margaret Cho, but I wonder if her best work is behind her. This show was vular and lazy. I am certainly not a prude but I don't think you have to be gross to be funny, and Cho certainly doesn't. She's done great work in the past,and I know she has the wit and heart to create hilarious comedy. But I think she's confused about who she needs to be right now. She's decided that the gay and lesbian community is her only audience. That's fine, but I still don't see why that means being completely crass and sophmoric. It's not like my gay and lesbian friends go around talking about thier ""parts"" all the time. They're not sex-obsessed and immature, so why does Margaret think she needs to write her jokes that way?"
2,Not Like Her Others,"I have enjoyed several of Margaret Cho's other appearances, but this just wasn't what I signed up for. She spent most of the running time making simple political remarks, with very few ""jokes"" to be had. It felt like an hour and a half of just watching her cuss about whatever is bugging her, with no other insights or funny diatribes. It was fine for what it is, but it simply shouldn't be labeled as stand up comedy."
1,I Me My Mine Rant!,"Scoble has a habit of publishing looong and boring videos on his blog. Rest of the time he will indulge in unprofessional mindless rants like this one --""Screw you Apple and your ads saying you're better than Microsoft. Screw you. Screw you. Screw you.Screw you and your controlling PR machine.Grrrrr."""
1,Charging for blogs?!,"ROFL @ Amazon actually trying to get people to pay to view blogs. Seriously, is this some sort of April Fools joke that they forgot to take offline?"
5,Clues to Love is a Five Star Read,"In Clues to Love, the reader is enveloped in the sweet savoury essence of an English country hotel and whisked into the lives of an enticing entourage of eccentric characters. Romance blossoms while a murderer stalks the inhabitants, and author Nancy Madison cleverly sprinkles a series of confessions amidst the clues to love and murder."
3,Excellent cinematography,"This is a charming movie that has quite a positive outlook, go and do it attitude. I enjoyed the attitude of the movie and the slow transformation of both characters. Angel-A is helping Andre get his life together. In the end, Andre himself has an influence on Angel-A and the characters struggle to go for what they want. I liked the movie, it was a bit slow though. The cinematography was excellent."
3,This movie is not what you think...,"It is about the noblest man in the world, who saves the life of a chain-smoking, drunk, brutal, compulsive lying angel & how they both find love. Great cinematography, and a delight to watch."
2,barely passable entertainment,"No, it would never happen in real life. Kind of boring, but okay ifyou have nothing better to do and want to watch a movie. would have been better in colour."
5,Great Movie,This movie is moving and touches the deepest part of the soul. We all have parts of ourselves we don't like or acknowledge and this movie will make one look at that side.
4,Enjoyable!,First of all I must say I got this as a gift from my boy friend and I did not think I would like it a few min in to it. However I continued to watch because well it was a gift and I am glad I kept watching it!It is a very low budget film so you have been warned! I liked the story myself and it is subtitled. It had a nice lay out and was in black and white i found the director does not need a ton of money and special effects even color to draw you in to the story.I am not a fan of b films or black and white but i did enjoy this movie.
4,"Goofy, strange, beautiful","Angel-A is a wonderful little treat from Luc Besson. It's goofy, it's strange, and when you think you know what happens it's something different after all. Every scene is beautifully composed and the lead characters sparkle like the Eiffel Tower in the background. My guess is you'll watch it once and think, ""Well, that was strange."" Set it aside for a few months and then view it a second time and you'll fall in love."
4,Besson's angels grace Paris,"You may consider this Luc Besson's version of ""It's a Wonderful Life"" set in 21st century Paris. Jamel is notGeorge Bailey and Rie's not Clarence(or Amelie)-they're thrown together into a hard deep noir world of lies and vice. Perhaps ""La Femme Nikita"" afoot in a tiny black dress, swimming with loan sharks?While Jimmie Stewart wrestled with fate in Shakespearean terms we see Jamel opened petal by hardened petal by Rie's Angela to a gnostic awareness of his soul and love, as the viewer is too. I came to care for both of them and thoroughly enjoyed the journey and the City of Light. May you enjoy it too.Besson is a master storyteller and his use of black and white is both a blessing and a tribute."
5,fantastic movie,"I wish we could make more movies like this in the USA. The French seem to have a lock on great movies these days. Maybe it's cause they aren't so profit driven. I can't say enough about this movie, another score for Luc!"
5,Angel-A,"Well i love forgeign films and this one cracks me up , it may not be for everybody but i have seen it 10 times and still think its funny , remember she is a chain smoking angel and a sexy b ! wardrobe"
3,How do i get music onto the flip album?,"Very nice program, I am enjoying using it but I would like to know how to add music from my hard drive or a cd? Do I need to buy a MP3 player to add music? Also, can the flip album be copied onto a picture cd? thanks. eddie"
1,Not as described..,"This was a tiny pendant that you could barely put an engraving on (less than 3/4"" wide) and no chain came with it.. It would have looked very silly on an 18"" chain, ~if~ it had a chain. Beware, not as described."
3,A Good but misleading collection,"This is a decent overview of Babybirds better album tracks.Don't go by the title ""Greatest Hits"".From 1996-2000 Babybird had 9 songs that made the British chartsincluding ""You're Gorgeous"" which hit number 3.None of those 9 charting songs are included here.Very irritating and misleading title.This should have been called ""Babybird picks his favorites""because this collection is neither a collection of his ""Greatest Hits""or ""His Best Of"" because such a collectionwould have some of those charted hits.Docked a star for misleading the music public."
4,pastors review,"I just finished watching the dvd series called ""Prima"". I read the book when I it first came out and I really enjoyed. I have not read a book by Mark Batterson that i don't enjoy. He is very challenging and thought provoking. This dvd is the same way. Its full of information and also very good visually made. I am a youth pastor and i watch lots of small group videos and i would have to say that that this is one of the top on my list of videos. I love how he teaches from an actual destination; that its not from an office or a room, but that we is actually there. I love how He asks questions and is also very real about his own life. He tells you about himself personally and how God has challenged him. We are actually starting our discipleship program this week and I am going to use this study in there with them. I highly recommend using it for adults, college age, or students."
5,Easy install and good looks,"Needed to replace the soft top on my 2004 Wrangler, and bought a number of Bestop items, including this deck cover. Very easy to install and no additional parts needed (used existing tail gate bar that came with Wrangler). I basically watched the video Bestop provided in the Amazon listing for this item, and bought all the items (bikini top, deck cover, window) shown in the video, including this deck cover. I like the look this gives my Wrangler, and it's been watertight, so far."
1,dont buy it,"in fact i bought it in september for friend as a gift , so the phone deliver to friends address directly , i did not see it till 2 -3 month later ,it was such a shame to give such a bad gift to friend !it can not work at all ,and its looking like the refresh old phone , so i try to connect the seller for return , but they told that we already expire the warranty , we only could send back the phone for repair ! but who want the refresh old phone ? i paid 288 usd for the new phone price , but they sent me trash .........."
4,Great gift; no card,My friend enjoyed the gift but she didn't know who it was from because no card was delivered with it.
3,misrepresented photo,"See the pretty Japanese style slippers in the Picture? Not so...cheap pair of solid white all cotton slippers is what came. This company always includes a name tag that says ""a special thanks for you"" but then they include their company name and 800 number. They just can't help themselves... always something or two to take it from classy to something less."
2,Mediocre,"I am a fan of Placido Domingo...the Opera & Zarzuela Singer...not the Ranchera singer, not the Broadway song singer, not the ballad singer. Placido is great at what he does, but his style on most popular is monotonous and he really doesn't bring anything to the table. I whole heartedly recommend Jorge Negrete for hard-core rancheras. Even Vicente Fernandez' performance on ""Joyas Rancheras"" is a much better recording of this genre."
1,Please Know TSO is Permanently OFFLINE,"unless you are a collector, please save your money. The Sims Online, commonly refferred to as TSO, has been permanently shut down by EA, the company behind all of The Sims games. If you wish to play an online type version, please visit facebook for their new facebook version, instead of wasting your money on a non-playable game.Hope you have fun on Facebook.PhotoMom2010"
1,Waste of time and money,"If you enjoy doing tedious tasks after installing a huge application, that lags horribly and sucks up a large amount of system resources, then by all means, this game is for you. Please do not waste your time and money with this game.If you want to know the specs of the computers I played it on, in case you think my boxes were slow, well here they are:note: All boxes were tweaked to give the best performance, and each experienced great slow downs when there were more then 13 people in a house.box #1Windows XPp4 2.8ghz60gig 72000 rpm hd with a 2meg cache (ata 133)radeon 7500T3 internet connection with bandwidth prioritybox #2Windows 2000duron 1.2ghz40gig 7200 rpm hd with a 2meg cache udma 66gainward geforce4 ti 4400 overclocked to be faster then a 4600cable modembox #3 (laptop)Windows XP800mhz p330gig 5400 rpm hdon board 11meg video card"
3,Helpful Truths,"I know a lot of people have seriously bashed this game and I must admit I really did expect a lot more but I will tell you the truths about this game so if you decide to buy it YOU really know what you are buying. Firstly, don't get the charter eddition because it REALLY isn't worth it. Ok now lets compare some things. The game really does not have an objective. I think it REALLY desperatly needs that. All you do is socialize, make money (VERY SLOWLY), and build a home. It really is basically a avatar chat. I mean you get to have room mates, you get to build a h ome. I think the game is fun but it definetly needs some upgrades that I assume will be made eventually :-) ..."
1,Not very Sim-ish,"I believe ""The Sims"" taps into our control freak nature. Most of the fun of the game is being able to control the little Sims, build their houses, have them interact with others, etc.The fun of the online version is completely dependent on other players. The money your Sim (and only one Sim) makes gets sucked up immediately. The ""spend money to earn money"" philosophy of the single-player version is abandoned. You can't build much of anything, much less furnish a place, and the buildings you find resemble HP -- party after party with no home life interaction like sitting down to dinner with spouse and kids.As the others say, it is a glorified chatroom. The majority of relationships in TSO were formed early in beta-testing and to get in on a relationship, a house, etc. at this point will be very difficult. In other words, there's no fun to be had.If you want a new Sims adventure, the only way to go is Sims2."
1,Poor direction...,It is just an add on for the great game to generate some more money for the company. The add on itself has lost its charm as a game... Not worth the expence...
2,DIE Electronic Arts!,"If EA ruins any more of Maxis's games I am going to plant a bomb in their headquarters!Everyone remembers Maxis in the 90's. Maxis spent time in their games and didn't just focus on garphics and they didn't let money get to them.Now, Maxis makes a bad mistake, which will probably ruin their company, THEY JOINED EA! EA is a fat, greedy company who is buying all the good companies into them. Money, Money, Money is all they care about.EA caused the Sims expansion pack disaster and made the Sims Online a flop.And the worst thing is, THEY RUINED SIMCITY! AHHHHHHHHHH!SimCity 4 was a very anticipated game. When it gets released, EA makes Maxis hurry it up so they can get money. EA just wants to bring it to stores without even giving Maxis the time to check for bugs.Oh, back to the game. It is not that great. Thanks to EA."
1,BORING,i have played the game for less than a year... and i am bored sick...i am not paying 10 bucks a month for a chat room that only people talk to certain people. than you get ignored. sorry not worth it in my opinion.
2,Its not worth the big expense,"This isn't a real multiplayer online game.After playing this game for far too many hour in order to try to progress somewhere with it, I have finally given up. I paid money to play an actual game and not just chat.A multiplayer online game is supposed to have a balance of socialization and actual gameplay with real objectives along with chatting.This is nothing but a shallow chatroom where you struggle to keep your Sims needs up, playing silly game objects, and teleport from place to place as there are no real downtown places to explore and you don't even have a real neighborhood to walk around in.If you must see for yourself, by the less expensive one. Don't invest in this one unless you are absolutely ready to do it."
1,Attention Parents,"Please consider very carefully before purchasing this game. Play it yourself before allowing your child to play...particularly anyone under the age of 18.As a 'Founder' (beta-tester) for 3 months, &, after being slapped by a 9 year old because I wouldn't get into the 'love-bed' (simulated sex) with him, you couldn't get me back to this 'over-rated CHAT program for losers"" with a team of wild horses!!! and...I will not allow my grandchildren to 'play'.Should you decide to purchase this 'thing' anyway, I'd recommend a high amount of Parental Supervision. There is a lot of very 'sick' stuff going on & Maxis doesn't seem to have put in the proper controls. The only contribution this game makes is everything that we don't want our children absorb...Please, spend a little time there yourself before agreeing to alow your child to play."
5,with a little disharmony as well,"Originally published in 1984, this collection features Baxter's least middle-class, most internally-troubled characters. They are senile, depressed, chronically lonely. The finale, ""The Crank"" is a gorgeous study of plot. The recently divorced protagonist's interactions with a similarly lonely guru are magical and uplifting. Baxter went on to mature considerably in terms of craft, but these stories are emotionally generous and smart."
5,it works,I needed vitimans for my kitten to grow well. This was just right. Well worth buying and will again when I run out
2,Ripoff of Carrie.,"In a pure ripoff of Carrie Lisa Pelikan plays Jennifer who has a scholarship going to a private school who gets made fun of by the snotty girls. Her overly religious father(Carrie) constantly makes her angry wanting her to rasie the snakes. when she was little she could hold rattlesnakes and nothing would happen to her. So when she gets pushed to far by the girls at the school she lets them have it snakes and all. The ending is so laughable with the giant snake head. I am surprised at the cast who played in this. JOhn gavin, nina foch,what were you thinking? Watch Carrie. Sorry lisa pelikan sissy spacek did it better."
4,The best you can get for the price !,"I've just received this unit and I'm very happy by its appeal even though it is a bit on the heavier side. till now it has performed flawlessly. It's a snappy performer as well. I tested some applications and the response time was good. The sound quality was average-good. The LCD is perfect (no dead pixels). However i was dissappointed when i found it did'nt have an IR as I would have used it with my Palm. In all, the product is quite good and of course it's a TOSHIBA (nothing to beat them in notebooks..."
2,Hard Drive Ticking / Clicking,"I always liked Toshiba laptops. This is my 3rd one. However, I was disappointed to discover the intermittent annoying clicking noises originating from the Hard Drive area. I have replaced the unit once thinking it was a problem, which was unique to one machine. Unfortunately, I discovered that the second unit had the same problem. So, if you do not mind the intermittent ticking noises from the hard drive it is a good affordable laptop. However, if you are picky and would like a smooth running machine, choose another laptop."
1,Mouse Crashes after Hibernation,"When waking the computer after hibernation mode, the built in mouse no longer works unless the computer is rebooted, which is tricky to do without a mouse."
3,Great entry level laptop,"Absolutely wonderful laptop,for [the] price, that is.Here is the caveat though! This laptop is really HEAVY(8 lbs) so unless you are really into fitness, u may want to reconsider.the CDwriter is a breeze, the 256 MB RAM is more than adequate for everyday use.on the whole, this computer is great for anyone who wd not mind lugging 8 lbs around."
1,Revised opinion after one month.,"I had to come back and correct my review of this laptop. After using it for 1 week it died. I exchanged it for a new one (same model) and that one had a bad power supply. I went back again and exchanged it again, and the replacement had a defective screen. All three were purchased new. I don't know if someone dropped a crate or something, but these laptops were cursed. I exchanged the last one for a comparable HP and have had no troubles since.. Buyer Beware!"
2,Good at first...but doesn't last long,"I'll admit this review is a little dated since this product isn't in the market anymore, but I was shocked to see how many GOOD reviews it had. I've had this laptop for a little over three years now, and since then, I've gone through two hard-drives with another about to die, and the cd-burner/dvd-rom hasn't worked well since about the second month of purchase. I've never gotten any games (even the low-end graphics ones) to work on here. It also seems like this system is highly vulnerable to viruses. I don't think that is just due to windows because I have other windows systems that have not had near as many viruses as this one. I think the only thing that's had me keeping this system is the floppy drive, since the newer computers don't have those.If for some reason you are thinking of buying this product: DON'T! You won't get great tech support on it and you'll just gain more frustrations."
1,"Very Boring, Difficult to Read","When I initially found out that Beth Goldner was writing a novel, I was elated. A friend recommended Wake to me last year and I loved it. The characters were interesting, loveable, real and I could not wait to see what kind of personalities Goldner could create for a novel. However, I was extremely disappointed with this book. Anjou seemed childish, insecure and needy and instead of finding her loveable, I found myself feeling sorry for Stella and happy that Quinn was intelligent enough to leave her. Had I not been a fan of Wake, I would have put this book down after the first 50 pages. I kept hoping it would get better, but it never did."
3,"Great book, poor formatting for Kindle","I bought this book for my Kindle, wanting to have some poetry with me. I found the formatting really bad - all the text is in a right-hand column with blank space on the left. This creates really short lines and requires a lot of scrolling."
1,Wounded Tiger Politics,"""Fat And Proud"" truly made me angry. By using the most worst case scenarios which overweight people could face, the author has done nothing but vent anger against sound medical judgement concerning obesity. From reading this book I couldn't help but think of a wounded tiger who'd fallen into an open pit, growling at its family members who'd been more careful. This not a helpful read, but an angry one."
1,Irresponsible,"As one who was once overweight and who knows the humiliation of biased notions of beauty, I was interested by the title of this book. Now while the author makes some adequate observations about society's prejustices against the overweight, this book left me with the feeling the author is simply attempting to make these flawed concepts a scapegoat for poor choices. Any act of discrimination is unforgivable and should not be tolerated, and I am only too familiar with cruelty vented toward the overweight. Yet, an attempt to promote pride for an unhealthy life choice is not only self-serving but also irresponsible."
2,outdated,"It is recommended that this book receive an update. Of 21 Mail Order Shops that I sent to, 10 are nonexistant to the US Post Office and I have only gotten catalogs from 2. I haven't even sent for information from other sections of the book because I have been so turned off by my waste of paper and postage. The information in the Who's Who section is interesting but if you read the back cover of your favorite books, you usually get a bio."
2,shallow,"To paraphrase the late Dorothy Parker ""This is not a book to be tossed aside lightly. It should be thrown down with great force."".... A paint by numbers approach to a rich and meaningful way of life. It should be listed in the Young Adults section for adolescents seeking 'fads', devotees of movies like ""The Craft"". I would suggest ""Drawing Down the Moon"" by Margot Adler,. There are quite a few good resource books listed here for the serious reader, but this is not one of them."
2,Gronow's Society Column,"One might expect Captain Gronow's memoirs to be predominantly military in nature, but they are not. The book is 5% war stories/history and the rest consists mainly of 19th century high-society gossip and name dropping. Unless you are trying to get a feel for 19th century gentrification, this is a very dull read."
4,Needs hooded ends,This patch cord fixes the issue of bulk which is great but my fear now is that I will soon break off the keeper tab as the connectors are not hooded. If they added a soft hood over the connectors this would be five stars. It is fine as is for it's intended use of going under carpets and anything where the installation is relatively permanent but for my use (in my travel bag of cords) it is likely to lose it's keeper tabs but only time will tell.
1,UltraFlat = UltraWack,You will not get the Cat6 throughput you are expecting from this product.The MHz is only 250! Cat6 is rated at 500MHz and higher!
4,Quintessential music for reproducing silent movies,"This CD will bring back memories of the Charlie Chaplan, Keystone Cops, and Mel Turpin era. The music is delightful, moving, and guaranteed to stir up the indelible images of the original silver screen. As an amateur film-maker, I feel this CD is essential for use as underscore for old home movies and other silent movie clips. Though not for everyone, if you are seeking this type of musical foray, this CD is for you."
2,I was disappointed,"I think that L. Ron Hubbard is an amazing author. Battlefield Earth is the greatest science fiction novel I have read. The Mission Earth series was a great read. Hubbards command of the english language and the cadence of his storytelling is that of a master. It is too bad that so many people seem to avoid his work due to Dianetics and Scientology.Final Blackout was written nearly 40 years before Battlefield Earth. His growth as an author during those years was painfully apparant after reading Final Blackout. His description of events and depth of character are scattered and weak, and I often felt lost in the stories path. I can see some early examples of his style that become perfected in his later works, but in this novel it really didn't quite work and I was disappointed."
2,Awful Pulp,"You know one should be used to the Great Man takes on the system book by now. They are so numerous that they shouldn't even annoy anymore. Yet this book takes it to the extreme. The Lieutenant is the great one, the grand poobah, the rebel leader hero. Everyone else is either a loyal follower or an evil petty bureaucrat. Sadly Hubbard spends many pages reinforcing these thin characterizations.Yes this book was written when he was young and it wasn't meant to endure. Maybe it can be read as a hokey 1940 pulp and a testament to the paranoia of perpetual war. It almost belongs more to the Vietnam era than WWII since all the generals and upper level military guys are selfish fools ready to sacrifice a million lives for their own glory (there's even the American Imperialists at the end) but I doubt the unadulterated praise for the Lieutenant would fly any better in Vietnam War America.Either way it's a dull book full of cliches that would have been long out of print without Scientology."
3,Yet another Doomsday scenario....,"This is a margainly interesting book about apocalyptic war. Its main attraction being that it is one of the first of the genre. Its worth a read, but its nothing to get excited about. The writing style is a very straightforward unimbelished style charicteristic of the writer."
5,Great Sci-Fi,"This is my favorite science fiction book of all time. The Lieutenant is an awesome character - today's leaders could surely learn a thing or two about leadership and honor from him! Great story, well written, suspenseful and makes you think."
4,"In my unbiased opinion, I rather liked it....","I am not a Scientologist, but I do like pulp fiction. FINAL BLACKOUT was an innovative tale for its time, and does a fairly good job standing on its own today. The story's general cynicism towards governments seems rather atypical of the patriotism in pre-WW II America. The characters are interesting, but a little stiff. There is a fair amount of action; the main character's strategies make for interesting reading (although some of the Lieutenant's tactics are a bit of a stretch). Final Blackout's main strength is its ""post-apocalyptic"" scenario, written well before that genre was synonimous with apes and Mel Gibson. Not the greatest pulp novel ever written, but a good, solid read. Even if you disagree with Hubbard's ""religion"", the man could spin a decent yarn."
4,The end of the war that never was,This book in some ways reminds me of Fatherland in the fact that WW2 lasted longer (a great HBO movie btw) It also reminds me that WW 1 would have lasted probably into a good amount of the 1920's if the US hadn't came in. Anyways the book is good...a great description at the beginning of how he was brought up. Also the fact he methodically plays solitare over and over to pass the war. Surprisingly this reminds me of the Vietnam conflict except this was written almost 20 years before Vietnam started.
3,Final Blackout,"This book by L.Ron Hubbard is a dark and fairly bleak novel. It endorses the idea of the beneficent dictator, It's style reminded me of the writings of Ayn Rand"
4,Material Artifacts Spun Into Historical Silk,"The Age of Homespun was an age created out of American myth, but behind this mythology Laurel Thatcher Ulrich has found many treasures of true lives led. The author takes fourteen objects and spins out a story of cultures clashing and times changing. It is a fascinating series of narratives richly written with economy and style. Ulrich is most effective in showing the Indian struggle in this settlers' Age of Homespun. The author leaves no one out of the story and her selection of objects reflects this care as she cleverly creates a complete mosiac for this age. The only struggle I had with the book was my own ignorance of spinning, weaving, carding, etc., therefore being confused by some of the terms and concepts. An interesting book and a pleasure to read."
5,EXCELLENT OVERVIEW,"Well it's not out of stock in QUÉBEC and AMAZON will certainly find it for you because along with J'SUIS NATURE,this is the best overview of MISTINGUETT who was as the title says THE EMPRESS OF THE MUSICAL.She had really earned her reputation singing and acting in revues written for her.Many singers started with her:JEAN GABIN(who became a well known movie actor);GEORGES GUÉTARY(who later got a part in AN AMERICAN IN PARIS)and of course MAURICE CHEVALIER who with her came to symbolize FRANCE all over the world until the end of world war two.Many songs here were written by ALBERT WILLEMETZ who was also MAURICE's favorite lyric writer."
4,Very satified with purchase,My husband had been looking everywhere for this after shave lotion and couldn't find it anywhere. No stores carry it anymore. So he was very pleased when I found it on line and ordered it for him.
3,Kinda stupid,"Kinda stupid to review ink. What can I say? It's black, as advertised. It works. Otherwise I don't have much of an opinion. What a waste of my time!"
2,"""Och it's viddy guid""","I was disappointed by this CD. I don't think his voice was very good when he was in his early twenties. And that Caledonia was a disgrace. Don't get me wrong I'm his biggest fan. The fiddle tune Craigie Dhu was awesome, just not the singin'."
3,All-new TV series Tom & Jerry,"It's funny. Because it's Tom & Jerry. Most of the episodes were pretty good (my kids loved the OCTO SUAVE a lot), ecxept for the first one. My kids did not like it. Most likely because they are too small to understant the cyber world. So I have to skip that one. Also, take this to your consideration: these 12 cartoons are from the ALL-NEW TV SERIES!!!"
4,Funny.,"My son received this as a Christmas gift and is still watching it from time to time. He is 11 and laughs out loud every time he has it on. It is nice to have ""clean"" fun for kids his age. His sister, also 11, enjoys it as well but doesn't feel the need to watch as often. Her sense of humor is just a bit different. Still, a great deal of fun and dad likes it, too."
5,Bring back the good old days,"I remember when I was little girl and I would watch Tom and Jerry all of the time, they were great. So, I got this DVD for my little 4 year old grandson, and he watches this over and over, just like he never seen it before."
5,Looks good; nice feel; does the job well!,"As others have noted, this keyboard and mouse are Extremely Easy to set up. Five minutes is all it takes. I've been using mine for a month and have had no problems whatsoever.I love the feel of the keyboard..it is crisp but you don't have to press hard. The buttons on top are great...easy to press for email, homepage, calculator, etc.What I love most, however, is that I can put the keyboard into my desk drawer when I'm done and have a very clean desk. The mouse fits neatly into its 'home' (charger) and occupies very little space.Overall, this was a great purchase at a fair price."
3,Good but not great,"My first wireless keyboard and mouse were easy to install and get working and nice feel and good-looking.However as a user of the firefox browser I was disappointed (!) to find that I could not program the hotkeys to facilitate and enhance my browsing experience. Furthermore, I do not seem to be able to switch off the keyboard (the mouse-yes) which I do not use much of the time, except by removing the batteries (not very sophisticated considering the technology). The mouse is larger than normal, which is good for my large hand and seems quite sensitive and has also some useful extra buttons.All in all....okaaay.......but not the bee's knees."
3,not for everyone,"Well, this video is full of energy and exiting butfor someone overweight and out of shape this isnt veryeasy to do, the steps are not that easy to followand i wanted something with real reggaeton songsfrom the real artists, the video has its own songs!"
4,You have all you need of the Jam in this CD,"Great CD, I'm not a fan, but I enjoyed it very much. It contains all the songs you need to listen from this british group and that definitely defines it as one of the best of their time"
3,Interesting One Disc Anthology But There Are Better Versions Out There!,"This Japanese-made anthology of The Jam originally compiled in 2002 has got 26 tracks on one disc which makes this good value on the face of it. However, the sound quality isn't the best and is a little muddy overall while one can't fault the track selections which fairly represent the best work this band has ever done. The first hits compilation of the Jam is an album called ""Snap!"" which has now been remastered by our friends from Japan and comes in 3 discs, 2 regular sized and 1 small size ep of live stuff and all in a mini-lp gatefold replica sleeve to boot. This version should be the one to get if you don't mind the price but if it's just a simple one-disc version that you are looking for and if you don't mind the sub-optimal sound quality than this lower-priced version is for you."
5,"Just as great as the 1st in series, if not better!",I would suggest buying this video to anybody who is interested in learning about symbolism on tarot decks and want to have or give stronger readings. It will really amaze you. It has helped my readings a great deal. Graphics of the cards on the video are wonderful and easy to see and understand. And just a lot of information throughout the whole video. You could look at the video everyday for a year and learn something new about the tarot. Morgan is great just like on her 1st one.
1,really awful,"I have been buying from Amazon for years, and this is the first review I'm posting, because I want to warn others that this DVD is absolutely terrible! It's cheezy beyond belief, and the woman who narrates is SO slow, and sounds like she could be reading from one of those booklets that comes inside a tarot pack. The ""sample spreads"" are ridiculous...they give nothing interesting, just the absloute most obvious and simplistic information. Please, spare yourself. I thought a DVD might be more ""entertaining"" than a book, but boy, was I wrong."
4,Major Arcana Symbolism,"This DVD is OK, provided you know what you're getting. Having just watched it, here's what I would tell you:This is only about the symbolism in the 22 Major Arcana cards.It does not cover the 56 other cards.It does not teach you how to do spreads.It does not teach you how to read tarot.As long as you realize this, then it's a good video. Each of the 22 cards gets a brief explanation, and then the card is shown full-frame with each item in the picture highlighted and explained. For THE FOOL card (shown on box cover), the sun, the cliff, the white rose, the belt, the coat, the wreath on his head, the jumping white dog, the feather, the wand in his hand, and the wallet at the end of the wand are all explained for their symbolic meaning (and I may be forgetting a few). This is done for each Major Arcana card.My only complaint is the sleepy new-age music in the background, which is way too loud relative to the speaker.Running time on the video is 59 minutes."
2,"Seems rather low-definition, somewhat disappointing",I had hoped for better clarity; it's pretty hazy. On my 47 inch HDTV is just isn't that realistic nor does it compare to HD versions I've tried. Easy/quick menu options and the different fire levels and looping were a nice idea....... But it's all about HD and this isn't it.
4,Nice basic ambience for relaxing,"I noticed some comments about the lack of a smooth loop transition and have to agree. But I didn't want anything fancy - just a nice simple crackling fire in the grate on my TV while I read/relax - no music or scenery, etc.This does the trick for me it's very relaxing and nice picture and sound, and I stopped noticing the 1-2 sec? stop and jerk into the next loop so I'm pretty happy with it. Good value for the money some of these are expensive and have a lot of extras I don't care about."
1,Lame at best,"I couldn't believe how lame this was after all the good reviews. I have a 52"" Sony Bravia XBR9 and the fire shows up pixelated at the top and weird colors....certainly not anything close to high definition. Don't waste your money on this one."
3,its just ok,"It looks ok, but the video quality is not, even for a mid size (42 inch) LCD, instead go for the blue ray for the best experience"
4,fiireplace dvd: real wood burning fire....,"Beautiful realistic takes up your full tv screen. Sounds are very realistic also, if you ae in the room and you don't see this on your tv, but can Hear it, it sounds just like a real roaring fire, crackles and all. Quite satisfied with this purchase. Would recommend."
1,SUCKS!,"Not worth the money, terrible quality videos. I went back to the one I bought in a bargain bin for five bucks."
5,"Philips Ambilight 47"" and this DvD Rocks!!!","Just get it, I tryed almost all, this is the one you want from production to quality and realism."
1,"BAD, VERY BAD","The quality of this fire dvd is terrible. The image and sound are not appealing at all, not even in a campy way. It is not soothing or warming, just ugly. The free version available on cable is much better. I'm sorry I didn't listen to the other one star review I read."
4,loved it,"I bought this for my Wife she seen it at a friends house and fell in love with it. I bought this for a Christmas Present My Wife Loved it , I would recomend it to any one who doesn't have a fire place and wish they did..."
4,fireplace dvd,"It's a good product, but didn't show well on my HD flatscreen television. I will probably give it away to someone who's tv is more suitable for it."
2,short,burns fast. 20-30 minutes from start to finish..looping is disjointed not as thrilling as the other reviewers. I own a fire and this is for ski trips...i would have done 2-3 complete fires with looping options for each fire. Adequate but not as exceptional as the other reviewers.
5,The PERFECT fireplace,I have a small condo and have always wished it had the space for a fireplace. I discovered this Fireplace DVD and am so pleased with it...it is the next best thing to having the real thing. I can almost feel the heat. It creates a relaxing atmosphere complete with the crackling of the wood as it burns (but without the mess of cleaning up afterwards!). This is perfect for a quiet day curled up with a good book or a beautiful background for a party.
5,The Fireplace DVD,"I positively love my fireplace full screen video. I had friends for dinner and set the mood with my video and Yanni CD. We had a wonderful relaxing dinner. My friends loved the video as well. It makes you feel warm and cozy. You can set the fire low, medium, and high, according to your mood, which is a great feature. The crackling makes it very realistic."
3,"Nice ""Fire""",I got this for a patient that wanted a fire over the holidays. It worked great and made them very happy.
4,It cleans.,"It can remove chemicals from the pads. I didn't realize that I should soak the pads into the solution as soon as I am done with the pads. But that didn't affect how clean the pads were after I had cleaned the pads. Next time I will soak the pads as soon as I am done with them.I also like the fact that they come in multiple sealed small packs. Then I only need to open one pack at a time, and leave the rest sealed."
2,REVIEW PIERRE CARDAN EAU DE COLOGNE.,"IT SEEMS THAT AFTER PURCHASING TWO SEPARATE ORDERS OF THE PIERRE CARDAN COLOGNE IT SEEMS THAT THE COMPOUND HAS CHANGED. THE SCENT IS NOW DIFFERENT THIS IS QUITE DISAPOINTING, AFTER USING THIS PRODUCT FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS."
2,Bad choice,When I bought this product thought I had made a good buy but was very disappointed.The cologne smells like an ordinary bathe soap
2,Good Jaco - annoying drums,"There is some good Jaco on this work, but the drummer is so repetitive and precise you might as well have programmed one beat into a drum machine. I guess this monotonous precision might impress some, but I found it devoid of any feeling. It finally annoyed me enough that it ruined the music for me. I sold the CD back. As always, your mileage may vary."
4,I've had it for many years... But I just ordered the CD,"I was lucky enough to get a copy of the master tapes from my friend Yaco Grau and, if you're curious to know, Jaco charged $100.00 Dlls. for the recording session! Carlos Cervantes idea was to fuse some Mexican Indian ethnic rhythms with the bass playing of Jaco, I don't think he achieved his goal, but the result is still interesting. This is not my favorite album but it has an special meaning for me. By the way, Yaco also gave me a recording of Jaco and Stanley jamming together in NY! The sound quality is awful but it's something worth listening to..."
2,Campaigns of the civil war,"Mr. Geer makes a vane attempt to prove that had things gone just a little differently then the South would have won the war. He continually refers to the war as the ""War of Session"" which tips the reader to his sympathies. Mr. Geer glosses over the complete breakdown of the Southern command at Gettysburg and continually pines for the ""what should have happened ""on the many Southern defeats or pushes. The book is a defense of the Southern policies and an exercise in hero worship of Generals Lee and Jackson. It should be read for what it is, another attempt to revise history"
4,"caulk ""if used outdoors""","Nice lamp. After installing, I read the directions which say ""use silicone caulk if used outdoors"". Now, how many of these get used indoors? Why doesn't the manufacturer pre-caulk the darned thing in the critical places? I bought this because the similar but different previous one died from rust due to water incursion over many years. But **where** should it be caulked?"
5,Frommer's guides are a big help.,Great book to have before you take you big trip and great to take along to guide you thru and help you know what is best.
2,Leaves much to be desired,"Unfortunately this book lacks much of the detail and thoroughness that some other guides to the Greek Islands offer (such as the Eyewitness travel guide). Although the major islands are covered in some detail, this book almost entirely ignores a lot of other islands, even some that are quite large. This is a real disappointment because the true wonder of the Greek Island experience is that you can travel to all kinds of places, some very small but no less significant. A good travel guide for the Greek Islands therefore needs to include just as much detail about these less-visited islands as it does about the more well-traveled ones. This book also lacks a lot of the photograps that other books include, which I think is important because the Greek Islands are so diverse. It really does help to see pictures of the islands to help you decide which ones to visit. If you're planning a trip to the Greek Islands you can do much better than this book for a travel guide."
2,Thick book and out of date,We just got back from a Greek isles trip and this book was a big disappointment. Overall it was a blah assessment of the islands that did not differentiate good sites from bad. It also appeared to us that the Crete section had not been updated in several years as we found restaurants and hotels that the locals told us had been closed for a while but were given stellar reviews. It's too bad Rick Steve's doesn't have a Greek Islands book!
2,"what, no map of Hydra or Hydra Town?????","what, no map of Hydra or Hydra Town?????I am going to exactly one island, Hydra.I was shocked that there is not even a sketch of the outline of this island which is of cultural importance.I have found it is difficult to find any map of Hydra anywhere on the Internet. I thought the book would offer something in this area.To be fair the text is well written in these Frommer guides. Just thought the lack of hiking maps on this no-car island is unforgivable."
4,Good info but repeats Frommer's Greece,"I thought this book would give me additional info about the Greek Islands but it only repeated what was in the Frommer's Greece book,with a few extra inconsequential chapters. You really only need one or the other."
2,not a practical planner for Kindle,"If you want a well written background book for the Greek Islands and culture this book does a good job but as a format for planning your trip (hotel, restaurants, etc.) it is pretty useless. I tried retreiving information about the Peloponnese region and Crete a number of different ways in my Kindle and could come up with no hotel reviews except a couple of brilliantly expensive highly rated hotels -- useless for those seeking a selection. I am hoping Rough Guides and Lonely Planet will have a more comprehensive listing. In paperback this guide might be more helpful but for Kindle it rates two stars."
1,This vendor is a Rip Off Artist,"This vendor posts misleading adds when confronted to refund money he refused. Vendor not providing 2000 Pre-Waxed strips rather only 8. No where in the add is the number of strips written except for the title of Moujan ""2000 Pre-Waxed Strips"". Moujan 2000 is the name of the manufacturer.Moujan 2000 Pre-Waxed Strips For Body"
2,"Aspect ration, video Quality, no subtitles","This may be 1:66:1 But it has black around all sides and if you 'zoom' the Quality is poor.Granted it is not HD video here, but it was presented in HD on tv.A real disappointment. Thankfully I recorded it via DVR, but that includes commercials and logos thoughout.Still easier to watch than this dvd.There are no subtitles - amazon description says there are.There are Discovery Channel commercials at the top of the DVDand the viewer is unable to 'skip' them. Bummer."
4,Great # 3 Fan gift!,"My husband really liked the book, and now it sits on a display shelf with the rest of his collection and looks very nice. Great item!"
5,Story will suck you in.,The second season gets a little more intense in regards to action. The storyline will still draw you in if you're a GITS fan.
5,Absolutely brilliant,"This animated series puts most live action drama films & TV series to shame. The animation is excellent; the stories are even better. Every episode is an absolute gem, much like a little techno-thriller feature film.It's a real pity cyberpunk fiction never really made much impact in the film world - but this series makes it all work.Apparently set in a world where Motoko Kusanagi never met the Puppet Master, this series involves complex political intrigue, cyber-crimes, people being hacked as one would hack a computer nowadays, etc.If you even remotely liked the Ghost in The Shell feature film, check this out if you get the chance."
3,Proulx On Prozac,"Having just finished ""Close Range,"" awed by Proulx's unique language of the Wyoming landscape, I was frankly disappointed by the stories in ""Bad Dirt."" These stories reveal a placid Proulx whose stories are so uncharacteristic, that they seem written by another author. Admittedly, the characters are similar, and the country is as barren and unforgiving. But Proulx holds back, and one senses that she has simply run out of steam, like one of her aging, spent ranchers."
2,"So near, and yet ...","Annie Proulx has the ability to paint images with words that most artists and photographers can only dream of doing in their media. This fact alone makes her book an enjoyable read by anyone who reads a lot. Unfortunately, imagery is about all there is to recommend Bad Dirt: Wyoming Stories 2. The narratives tend to drag in many of the stories, in others the author has trouble getting the suspension of belief she seems to be looking for. All in all, for this reader at least, a major disappointment. For readers who have enjoyed other works by Proulx, I wouldn't recommend reading this one."
1,Narration/acting was awful,"I am SURE I would love this book if I READ it, but instead got it on audio. It was just awful It was a poor performance, not a narration, and I could hardly bear to listen to Dufris. I was on a long trip and had no other audiobook with me, but I stopped listening anyway. Silence was better than this.Maybe it is just me, but when I read a book, I do not imagine different voices for the various characters in a novel. So it annoys me no end when I listen to a book where the narrator plays different parts. To me, this is kind of creepy, epecially when a female narrator *plays* male roles or vice-versa. And it is really bad when the narrator/performer is not very good.Perhaps it would be helpful if the cover said ""performed by"" instead of ""narrated by"".I just want someone to read the darn book to me. I am not interested in listening to someone who thinks s/he is up for an acting award!"
4,Hungry for more!,"This author writes with a depth of knowledge of her locality. You find yourself unable to put the book down, and the biggest disappointment is reaching the end, and wishing there was more. Annie Proulx knows human nature, and is not afraid to delve between the shiny surfaces and pull out the grimy undercurrent which motivates her characters. A must read for real escapism!"
4,bad dirt,"bad dirt, book 2 of wyoming stories by annie proulxharsh rural life in wyoming, the nature and background of who settled there first was good. the nature really enthalledme to keep reading, such beautiful things in life."
5,Musclease is sooooooo relaxing,"We mix Musclease with Instant Refreshing Gel and rub then rub it into our neck, shoulders and back. It unwinds the tension for rest."
4,Fairly well,Good for a light massage. Costly for a product that you may not use long term. Does provide stimulation to your limbs. Decide for yourself.
1,unstable!,"I've had excellent luck with Tweezerman products in the past, but the quality of this blackhead remover was second-rate. The item consists of a hollow metal tube with two screw-in attachments.Neither attachments really work. The threading of both seems to be flawed. And to use it as intended would mean to press an unstable attachment against your face; no thanks!My e-mailed request for re-threading or replacement to Tweezerman went unanswered. This purchase was an expensive mistake."
2,Poor Craftsmanship,"Both ends of item can be unscrewed, turned around, and screwed into the shaft such that the working ends are ""retracted"" into the handle -- safe for storage... but on mine, the threads weren't turned properly, and the lancet doesn't stay attached and the blackhead remover doesn't come unscrewed.The heft of the tool is nice, though... but the distribution of weight doesn't feel substantial or balanced.The opening on the blackhead remover isn't large enough to effectively surround my pores (yuck, I know... but we all know what this is for... ), so it sits in my cabinet waiting for the really tiny blackheads.Complete waste of money."
5,I Recommend!,Love this little tool! It doesn't leave your face scarred when used the right way. Whiteheads and blackheads are eliminated quickly with less squeezing and damage. I would recommend to anyone who likes to pick on their face or tends to have scarring as a result.
2,The Dynamic Laws of Prosperity,"The message of the book is good, but unfortunatley it was too religious for me. It doesn't explain that before you read it. It should be more directed to religious people and faith based followers. I didn't care for it"
3,interesting read,"I think the book has the right ideas, but it is full of obvious made up examples, ie. A woman I knew Joan lost all her money, she then continued to ask for help. The pastor of her church informed her that her Sunday school class raised money in her honor because she was in their prayers. ...... WHAT?! it reminds me of the lamb and the tiger stories from Sunday school back in the day."
2,Great Information But....,"Dynamic Laws of Prosperity has a lot of useful information. I did not care for the ""type setting"" and the ""lay out"" of the book. It was hard for me to follow at times...the book just didn't flow. Having said that though the information Ms. Ponder shares can change your life!"
2,Disappointed in new publisher,"I've owned the DeVorss publication of The Dynamic Laws of Prosperity for many years. I bought this version for a friend. I was very disappointed in the new layout, the typographical errors, and sections left out. For example, Chapter Six, ""The Prosperity Law of Command"" is ""The prosperity law or command"" ""or"" in place of ""of."" There was a section, about 3/4's of page long missing in one of the chapters. The only reason I gave it two stars is that it is the book written by Catherine Ponder. I suggest that you buy a used copy of the Devorss publication - the white one with the 15 point sun on the front."
5,Catherine wrote one of the first and best of all the Prosperity Books,"I have read all of Catherine's books, but the Prosperity book is my favorite. Her affirmations are powerful, and her antecdotes about how others have prospered by affirming goodness and plenty, are heart-warming, and motivational.She taught us how to ""reframe"" unfortunate happenings before NLP had been formulated, by putting a positive spin on all situations.She taught us how to deal with ""energy blocks"" before anybody was even talking about blocks to energy.She taught us about ""divine order"" and truly living in faith, and how that attitude changes everything in your life, for the better.This book is about creating prosperity that far exceeds just money. It's about opening all the doors and windows in your life and lettng in all of the abundance that's already yours.If you liked the Secret, you will be bowled over by this book. It offers true wisdom, heart, and a roadmap to creating the life of your dreams."
5,law of prosperity,Excellent lessons in the truth about prosperity. Awesome thank you.I got this at a perfect time. Divine order indeed.I am so much more prepared to face life now that i have learnt these things.God is truly amazing. He works in mysterious ways.
1,Christian Ministry,"If I had known Catherine Ponder was a minister, I would never have bought (and returned) this book. If you believe prayer and positive thinking will bring you prosperity, I suppose this book will be fine for you. If you aren't a devout Christian, however, you might find this book hard to deal with."
4,The Dynamic Laws of Prosperity,I had heard about this book and I highly recommend reading if you wish to understand the power of the Universe!
4,Covers every topic imagineable!,"We've found this book is a good source to answer any questions or settle any doubt regarding any etiquette question we've faced--everything from how to handle a clogged toilet at a guest's house to where to put the dessert spoon on your table and everything in between. She uses a two-part format: Actual questions from readers are answered and where more detail or history is needed, Miss Manners uses a standard paragraph format to inform her gentle readers. I think I've actually read all of Miss Manners' books--they're really enjoyable and amusing!"
1,Not Tear free and does not color on the tub or wall.,"I was very disappointed with this product. Not only did is sting my son's eyes, but they also do not color on any part of the tub or surrounding walls. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
1,hours of fun in the tub???,"This item listing gives the impression that it is a bathtub crayon that will color the walls. They don't - simply crayon shaped. We were looking forward to playing with the soap but were deeply disappointed. Each soap also arrived split in pieces due to poor packaging and they split again when wet. I give 1 star because it's actually good body soap, not grimy."
1,Sadly Disappointed,"I ordered the Crayon Soap because I thought it would be so much fun for the kids (and get them clean). Instead, it does not color on the tub and it burns their eyes. I had to throw them away (2packs) because my kids insist on trying to play with them yet they kept getting it in their eyes!! This may be ok for older kids that know how to keep their hands off their face and don't care about coloring with them. I too give it 1 star for at least it's natural. Very Dissapointed!"
1,Pointless Crayons,"These crayons really serve no purpose. As the previous reviews state, they do not write on the wall well at all. Mine also got very slimy after being in the tub area for an extended period. My kids were simply not interested in them after the first time we used them."
2,Not his best,"I found this tape in a bin of cassette tapes at the now defunct Twitty City in Henderson, TN. This is not one of the best produced Ricky Nelson tapes that I own. As a matter of fact it is the worst in my collection of Ricky Nelson albums. There's a lot of hiss on it and the hits I enjoyed by the late artist weren't on it. But the best thing I can say is that it didn't cost much. It might have been a good album if it had not been for the poor production. I was very disappointed in the selection and quality of this tape. You would be better off skipping this tape and finding a better produced Ricky Nelson tape.The best of my Rick Nelson albums(CD) is his love songs compilation produced partly by his youngest son Sam Nelson."
3,The Girls Sapphoe goes to Hollywood,"It was a good book ,but had lots of assumptions!Sentences starting ""almost certainly"", and such as that.The biggest assumption was that because Marlene Dietrich and Garbo,were maybe in the same movie,that,""almost certainly"",Dietrich had an affair with Garbo,that made Garbo the wack job she was the rest of her life!"
4,Very Surprising,"One of the questions you ask after reading this was, who wasn't gay? The whole thing was close to shocking because I had no idea that life was so free and easy in the 20's, 30's and 40's. The book did keep me interested. I wondered about some of the facts which I'm sure no one will ever know the absolute truth about."
3,fantasy,"Nearly all of Dianne McLellan's accounts of Greta Garbo's lesbian liaisons are unreliable, and therefore should fail to titillate. Otherwise this book is well written, entertaining and informative."
5,Highly recommended for movie buffs.,"The Girls provides quite a different look at the Hollywood environment of the 1920s to the 1940s as Diana McLellan examines the lives of lesbian and bisexual actresses of the times, analyzing relationships, power plays, and politics alike. The Girls provides a lively, fun chronicle of affairs and scandals and is a recommended pick for any fan of Hollywood intrigue and culture."
1,Too fantastic to be believable,"This book is virtually ALL speculation, and a frustrating read. NO hardcore facts, timelines are all off. The sad thing is that so many people want to believe it (see above), the myths perpetuated here have already become part of gay Hollywood history. If you want to read something by someone who has done his homework, please turn to William J. Mann's BEHIND THE SCREEN instead."
3,More gossip than fact,I enjoyed getting to know some of the Hollywood insiders and the writing was fast paced enough to prevent boredom but I felt I had to take it all with a grain of salt. Seemed based as much on speculation by the author as any research done.
5,Screamingly hilarious,"This book was screamingly hialrious for anyone who has grown up in the church and understands all the drama involved. The book is composed of one year's worth of the church newsletter from St. Yorick's parish. Each month, the vicar writes an intro, there is a witty cartoon, a children's corner, and tons of other hilarious articles in Plass's classic british humor. I love his books. simply can't get enough."
3,Jazz-rock big band music,"This set documents the latterday work of George Russell, conducting a set of jazz-rock charts performed by a large, mostly British band with fine players like Andy Sheppard & Ian Carr. (It also features the notable guitarist Dave ""The Fuse"" Fiucynski, one of the best players here.) It's very much of a piece with Russell's Blue Note discs of the period (which seem now to be out of print--_The African Game_ & _So What_). Sad to say, despite the talent on display, I find this music only mildly engaging. I respect Russell for his exploration since the mid-1960s of jazz-rock, which parallels the developments in the oeuvres of Miles Davis, Carla Bley & Gil Evans, but I don't think he has ever made an essential album in the idiom. This is worth a listen, but hardly displaces the memory of Russell's classic Riverside & Decca dates."
1,Waste,"Crap software.Crap developer.Waste of money. Waste of time.If you ever find this program, just wrapit in tp, that's where it belongs."
2,Rolling and somewhat boring,"This was my first experience with a Bill Frisell CD. As a banjo player and a fan of jazz this intrigued me. Danny Barnes being an innovative banjo player with a jazz guitarist could have been much better. The first cut ""Sitting On Top Of The World"" was a cool start but then it went down hill after that. If I was still in the 60's and taking drugs it may have really been a great cd. But it just never had an upbeat to it. Just rambling along as if there was no end. Cluck Ole hen kinda livened things up for a short time and two versions no less. John Hardy was so slow you could hardly recognize it. I like jazz a little more upbeat, well alot more upbeat to be honest so this wasn't the cd for me."
1,A disappointment,"I bought several of the tracks individually. They were so good that I bought the entire album. Turns out that those tracks were the only good stuff on the album. The rest were a little condescending to country music in general and poorly performed. Buy Norah Jones doing ""Love Me"" off the sound track to ""Knocked Up"". Skip this album at all costs."
5,Will Not be without this.,"I purchased this last spring when I had chipmunks. We live in country setting. I plugged in my garage and Chipmunks,Squirrels....etc. Will Not come in garage. It even kept out the pesty Bees last year. Won't ever be without one. Very Pleased with this."
2,"Very Dissappionted, Waste of time and money","My daughter received this for christmas. She was thrilled. We placed the egg on it and it opened right away without any prompts. It did this for about three times and then wouldn't open the egg anymore. I assured her we probably need to put fresh batteries in and then it would work. Not so, I replaced the batteries three times to be sure that wasn't the problem. Then I exchanged it. That one never opened an egg at all although it did go through the prompts. I was able to find extra eggs and out of desperation, opened them with a screwdriver. My daughter truely loves the excitement of finding out what animal is in the egg. She would really love this if I could manage to get one that works. I think the maker of this toy needed to test it out more. It has been really dissappointing!!!!"
2,"Great idea, poor function. Two broke right away!","My daughter got this for Christmas. Opened 4 eggs before it broke that day...would go through whole sequence of buttons to push and then say the egg was hatching but would not open. Exchanged it for a new one. That one never opened an egg. In addition, I had been looking for extra eggs for weeks prior to Christmas to go along with the set and very hard to find. So, great concept, but poorly made. And, once your kid goes through the 'hatching' process a couple times, they can cheat the system by just pressing the buttons quickly and works just as well to hatch the egg. At $5.00 plus and egg, your kid hatching them in less than five minutes for a small plastic animal is not very exciting for us parents! The play value afterward is very minimal. I wanted to like this but a dissapointing venture."
4,Fall in Love with Rodgers & Hammerstein,"I was browsing through the DVD section when I came across this gem. I'm not a big musical lover myself but I found myself humming along by the end of the DVD. ""Rodgers & Hammerstein - The Sound of Movies"" is a well done A & E television production. The various sections of the DVD are hosted by Shirley Jones, Rita Moreno,Charmian Carr, and Nancy Kwan. The documentary covers classic movie productions of State Fair, Oklahoma!, Carousel, The King and I, The Sound of Music, etc. With interesting tidbits about casting, production, missing scenes and/or songs, this documentary has something both people who love the musicals and those who have never seen them before. By the end of the documentary, you actually will want to see the movies themselves. There are no special features to the DVDs except the ability to do chapter searches so there probabily is no advantage to buying this on DVD versus VHS or laserdisc."
1,Big Mistake,"I was looking for ""The Sound Of Music"". I guess I'll have to update my spectacles and sharpen my reading skills."
1,Thought it was Sound of Music,"Very disappointed when movie arrived. I thought I was ordering Sound of Music. I contacted seller, BIGBUY, to do an exchange and never received a response. Pretty dissappointing. I will nevery purchase from the seller BIGBUY again."
5,This book is a real keeper,"I purchased this book when I was going through some really rough personal times and it was really so very helpful. I have always loved Joan, but this book was a great tool in pulling myself up when I didn't think I could. Thanks Joan - you are a real life-saver!!"
2,Joan Rivers Is A Bad Role Model,"This book is pure CHUTZPAH. Where does such an unhappy,driven woman think she can go with advice.Try Katie Couric if you want advice from a survivor."
2,"Well-meaning, but misses the mark","Though Joan Rivers has gone through some rough times, her qualifications as a motivational speaker/self-help guru are lacking. She instructs people who have gone through major life crises (i.e. the loss of a spouse, major illnesses, etc.) not to wallow in their pain for more than one weekend. How can a person possibly get over the loss of a loved one in just one weekend? This book, with its one-liners, trivializes people's pain and suffering by saying that you have to ""snap out of it,"" and suggests that redecorating the house will make one feel better. Rivers should stick with what she knows best -- insulting people."
1,Can we talk about bad books?,"If you want to help yourself, do NOT read this book. Joan Rivers, the Queen of Mean, is the last person in the world who should be dispensing advice. She has the compassion of a shark, and this half-hearted attempt to change her image just doesn't wash."
1,Pitiful,"Joan Rivers presents herself as the most put upon victim in the world, the ultimate survivor. Heartrending. I'm sure that the AIDS victims, the cancer patients, the Christopher Reeves of this world, will join me in sympathizing with this martyr."
3,Confused by the Author,All of Joan's powerful words urging us to believe in ourselves left me confused...why does she continue to use humor as a way to put down others? Somehow I believe her pain has not helped her learn. Bobbi
4,KnifeSafe is NOT included,"Just recently received my knife, and so far it is a nice knife. But as the description states: All forged knives from LamsonSharp are shipped in their own KnifeSafe, to protect the knives and the people who use them.The KnifeSafe is not included, it simply comes packaged in a box, and that's it. Not something I would describe as a method for protecting people who use them. Apparently, the safes are sold separately."
5,heavenly,"honestly, this music brings tears to my eyes! These are the sounds you should be listening to while driving through the farmland southwest of oswego in summer, or speeding down 294 in the middle of the night. I love this man for beginning his 50 states tour with the two best states of the midwest (not to mention the whole country). The music is amazing, but i think he's missing a few things in both Michigan and Illinois, like lake michigan (thats huge). Even if he sang about the east coast and california, i would still love him for calling the album Illinois."
5,scary,"This album builds on the best parts of Sufjan's earlier Michigan album as well as Seven Swans. It has the lyrics and the great storytelling that make him a standout from so many dime-a-dozen 'singer-songwriters' out there. There is some intelligent social commentary packed in without being heavy handed or overtly political.The music itself is beautiful. He somehow retains his folk feel but goes all out with the strings and female backup vocals in several songs.The song ""John Wayne Gacy"" is probably the ultimate juxtaposition: lyrics that cover incredibly dark subject matter set to beautiful instrumentation and light vocals.Definitely worth owning. Fans of Wilco, Stephen Malkmus, the Shins, Damien Jurado, or Elliott Smith should give Sufjan a listen."
5,"Play it again, Sufjan","I stumbled onto Sufjan Stevens after downloading an MP3 of Casimir Pulaski Day, and I haven't been disappointed yet. The evocative melodies, the folksy rhythms, and playful lyrics all come together in a highly impressionistic portrait that extends far beyond the bounds of Illinois. It is a pleasure to hear a literate musician evoke such memories as well as inspire new ones."
4,How Can This Be Human Made?,"Wow! Stunning work across the board. The first 12 songs could easily have sufficed for a great album, but luckily Sufjan Stevens pushed on. The result is a 23 song work of grace and poignancy that one can listen to time and again. Listening to Sufjan Stevens makes it a little bit easier to deal with the loss of Elliott Smith. Both are great crafters of song."
5,One of my favorite CDs of 2005,"Definately one of the most unique and lovely CDs of the year. Standout tracks include the opening song, the haunting and harrowing ""John Wayne Gacy, Jr."" and ""Chicago."" Totally original, totally lovely. Great artwork too."
5,Something else,"If on first listen you can't quite grasp this album, give it time. That has been the case with me. First time through, I was reading a book and listening through the album to get a feel for it. This is the first album i've not been able to do that with. I put the book down and started over at track one. Second time through, this album started growing on me, and it gets better at each consecutive listen. Songs that really caught me were ""John Wayne Gacy, Jr"", ""The Predatory Wasp..."", and ""The Seer's Tower"", although there really is something for everyone. So many instruments, and so many played by Stevens, it's just interesting to listen to. This guy is bringing another layer to the exploding genre of folk rock. If you liked this, try The Decemberists ""Picaresque""."
4,Is Sufjan Stevens a Genius?,"No matter how dark his subject matter (serial killers, assassinated presidents, etc.), Sufjan Stevens' bouyant melodies and soundscapes carry the listener happily along. I have my issues with the album (hence the 4 stars): he seems to take himself too seriously, the choruses can sound a little too much like Polyphonic Spree, and so many musical interludes begin to feel like filler. However, the whimsical tone does not undermine his literate lyrics and the tunes are so catchy and memorable that my 6 year-old daughter can often be heard singing ""Chicago""."
4,Late to Join In,"So perhaps I am late to jump on the bandwagon, but I really enjoy Sufjan's Illinois cd. There is quite a variety of sounds on the cd, making it consistently interesting. Some of the lyrics are hysterical, the way that he works to fit in the names of Illinois towns and famous citizens. I suggest this cd, especially to those who, like me, are recent transplants to the state."
3,I bought this cd based on a number of the excellent reviews and genre it was lumped into...,"I think my expectations were too high. And no way should this have been an album of the year as other reviewers have stated. I do think he is talented, and the cd itself is better than 90% of the garbage that is out there today, but it kinda grated on my nerves after a while. Was it too long? Did it have too many layers? I can't really pinpoint it...and I'm also hoping that it will grow on me.I do recommend giving it a try, if only to expand one's exposure to something different."
3,"All right, but mainly tepid","I was very excited about this album, given Amazon choosing it as the 2005 album of the year. They reference several artists I adore (Cake, The Sea) as being indicative of what I would hear. I also like very personal, intimate lo-fi (self-produced works) that are rich with imagery and originality. For example ""In the Aeroplane over the Sea"" by Neutral Milk Hotel is my idea of a real masterpiece in this genre. Unfortunately I did not respond to ""Illinoise"". It's emotionally quite leaden, despite steven's belle and sebastian heartfelt warbling. Unfortunately, that also applies to the songwriting which I found far too laboriously delicate and ineffective. melodically, it's forgettable and it never adds up to a truly moving or infectious listening experience. All in all, a major disapointment -- and i was so hoping for one. However, I will buy ""Pennslyvania"" so I can hear a dity called ""Pirogies and Funnel Cake"". Yes, the 50 states idea is a cute one. for now."
5,Bets of 2005: An album you get to discover little by little,"I remember when I first heard (of) Sufjan Stevens. Though my first encounter with his music challenged some of my conventions at that point, I was marked and could not let go after I ran into ""Illinois"". This, his following installment in his monumental 50 State Project, was even better than its predecessor (""Michigan"") and most of the music released in 2005 you may run into. Hovering around a beautifully poetic musical and lyrical theme, Stevens captures your imagination and takes you on a virtual musical trip through The Prairie State, leaving you wondering whether you were actually there, or it was a trick that he brilliantly played on you without you noticing it.After many, many, many listens, I keep discovering more in this album, and still can't get enough of it. I am in for the long run, until he runs out of states to write albums about."
5,What Can Anyone Say?,"Simply put, this album is a one of a kind listen, taking you through the state and history of Illinois. Steven's stories range from optomistic and exciting to dark, and sometimes even chilling. To portray these stories, he uses jazz, folk, and pop in ways that I have never heard before. This album is one of the most diverse and intriguing albums I've heard that was released after 2000. This album is definitely the best album of the year and one of the best albums since 1990. Just beautiful... it's not the songs, it's the album as a whole. It flows unimaginably well. Buy it now; and when you receive it, open it up, take it into the room with surround sound, dim the lights, and just take off. The trip will be incredible."
4,What's in the water?!1,"With great new record this year from Sufjan, Animal Collective and Bill Ricchini it is shaping up to be a banner year for Brooklyn based songwriters adn arranger-- what's in the water?!. At seventy-four minutes, Illinois is an exercise in patience; considering how long it takes to dog paddle through all the gooey orchestration, chugging through Stevens' meticulous arrangements and parsing out the melodies, Illinois is a bit of a commitment. Its 21 tracks consist of a handful of transitional snippets (many arresting in their own right), and plenty of good stuff (""The Tallest Man, the Broadest Shoulder"", in particular) is buried way in the back, rewarding those who persevere, and in both theory and execution, Illinois is huge, a staggering collection of impeccably arranged American tribute songs."
2,Let's make noise exploding this CD against a brick wall.,"I see that another reviewer labeled ""Michigan"" as his masterpiece. I made the mistake of buying that CD and listening to it 2-3 times. What garbage. I only listened to the Amazon samples of these songs and that was more than enough. He sounds like a college kid trying to be cute while making up these songs as he goes along. What cutesy song names too. Let's all pat him on the head. Next."
2,I don't get it.,"What is the deal with this guy? Everybody fawns over him like he was the second comming or something. All I hear is some guy singing wispily over hushed atmospheric accompaniment. Okay, there are some fairly standard wispy pop horns here too. But I dunno - mixing Americana, over-erudite lyricism and early 90's twee just doesn't seem that groundbreaking to me. This record is pleasant in it's own dull little way, but these reviews seem like a sort of collective psychosis. I will admit that this is one of the greatest album TITLES in years, but the music just isn't.I don't see what Sufjan does here that's any better than stuff groups like Belle and Sebastian, Willard Grant Conspiracy, and Trembling Blue Stars were putting out 10 years ago. Enough mopey singer-songwriters already. I'm calling for a moratorium on anyone who sounds even a little bit like Nick Drake. Who's with me??Paging Merle Haggard. Beatdown needed in aisle 3."
3,Sufjan makes history,"This is one of those records that come around once every couple of years where the story and hype surrounding the artist absolutely overshadows the actual music. When you mix in the ingredients of a unique concept, cheerleader press photos, christianity, and serial killers people will listen. While he crafts interesting and sometimes fascinating subject matter, buried inside are mostly forgetable tunes. Lackluster melodies and predictable progressions haunt the lion's share of this record. Sufjan could benefit from a listen or two of BC Camplight or Burt Bacharach to tweak his ""pop"" sensibilities. Then he'd be invincible."
2,Very Over Rated,"I consider Illinois by Sufjan Stevens to be the most overrated hipster album of the year. I swear, nothing on this album sticks out whatsoever. I must have listened to this thing a dozen times and nothing clicked. It sounds like a whiny singer songwriter who is going out of his way to be different by playing with a band that sounds like a high school orchestra.I like the idea about doing an album for every state, but the music doesn't hold up to such an ambitious idea. Sufjan Stevens and this album seem to a product of hype and reviews from sources like Pitchfork and Mojo who pressumably have indie cred. So to sum up, avoid this, even if listening to it makes you hip with the coffee shop crowd."
1,What's the point?,"I don't ususally write reviews to put things down, figuring that if I don't like something, perhaps I just don't get it, so I should keep thoughts to myself. But this album topped so many critics lists for 2005 that I feel compelled to comment: It's just not that good. It's not that I don't get it. Yes there are a lot of clever things going on, and I've really tried to like it. But what does it all add up to? What's the point? Try as I might, I find it boring and tedious. For me it completely lacks any true soul of what music should be about and be trying to say. I realize that is a personal observation, so you may still really like this. For me, I'll stick with my own favorite of 2005, ""You Could Have It So Much Better"" by Franz Ferdinand. I guess I like to get my fill of clever lyrics with rocking guitars and cool dance beats rather than flute recorders and choirs."
2,See all the other 2 star reviews...,"Pretty much agree with the others who gave it two stars. Overrated, forced and bit too dull. And I'm from ""Illinoise"", so I oughtta know what dull is..."
5,This from a Christian??,"""Contemporary"" ""Christian"" ""music"" has no signature sounds and is boring as being slumped over dead in a wheelchair. So it comes as a huge surprise to hear something so utterly creative, so wonderfully genius - from a Christian, no less. I am very impressed. This album is something I've come to appreciate with repeated listens (especially with a good pair of headphones). I can hear why this was lauded to critical acclaim as a best of '05. Terrific arrangements and instrumentation make this one of those records you can ""find"" things buried after multiple plays. Great stuff. If ever a remake of Milos Forman's film ""Hair"" is ever produced my vote goes to Sufjan Stevens to write the songs and score it."
5,"Original, creative, musical,...what more could you want?","I received this as a Christmas gift, and I'd have to say it's one of the best gifts I received. At a time when so much of the new music being produced is either boring, derivative, or just plain non-musical, this was a refreshing surprise.I hear traces of Alan Parsons Project with a smattering of Renaissance and even Polyphonic Spree; but in no way is it a direct emulation of any of them. The styles of the tracks drift from rock to jazz to folk, with even a fairly strong Phillip Glass influence to many of the compositions. In other words, this album is hard to put into any specific classification, which no doubt will limit its sales, sad to say.If all that wasn't good enough, the album is available on vinyl (which is the version I have)."
4,a great album,"I was driving the other day listening to the song ""Chicago,"" and through my rear-view mirror I saw two girls riding a vespa were behind me zooming through the frosty streets. The morning light poured onto their faces as they pointed and laughed as they held each other to keep warm. It was a perfect moment with a perfect song, and reminded me why I like music so much in the first place. This is one of those albums that will quickly become a classic.With that said, sometimes this album feels a bit overlong, and you'd really have to be in a Sufjan Stevens mood to listen to it all the way through. Part of me wishes that it had 10 or 12 songs rather than 17, but I'll give it the benefit of the doubt because they're really great songs. Recommended."
4,At least buy Chicago from Itunes,The song Chicago is probably worth the purchase price of this album.I was in Bali in September 2006 and a local girl I met listened to that song on my MP3 player and cried because it moved her so much. I can understand the sentiment.
3,3.5 Stars,"Perhaps the most critically acclaimed indie release of 2005, 'Illinois' is an ambitious though often bland opus. Stevens continues his 50 States Project with this lengthy collection of light, sometimes orchestral indie folk. The bloated song titles border on pretension, especially those for the half-dozen sub-minute tracks. 'Come On Feel The Illinoise' is the highlight; 'Chicago' is also good. Pitchfork dubiously named this the best album of 2005 - I suppose that if I lived in Illinois I'd probably enjoy this much more."
3,Overrated... I really wanted to love this album.,"I don't see what the big deal is about this album. I mean, I see how it could be appealing... I like the fact that there are a variety of instruments, complex arrangements, and creative/unusual song structures (not to mention titles). But the fact is, beyond all that, the songs are just not that good. His overly soft-spoken singing approach also grows tiresome pretty quickly. It's okay from time to time... but it's literally all this guy can do. Anyway, I really wanted to love this album. I love this style of music. But I listened to the entire thing front to back 3 times, and the only song that stuck with me and made me want to listen to it again was ""Chicago."" I see a lot of potential in this guy, and kudos for being such a prolific songwriter, but in my opinion his melodies (the heart of the song) need work."
5,Come feel the hype,"And the hype is true. Yes, it is one of the best albums of 2005. A sprawling album full of strings and instrumentation; and so, so pretty. Like if Magnetic Fields got some major label money for some real production work. And yet this is not a major label album. Covers the state from John Wayne Gacy to Abe Lincoln to Frank Lloyd Wright to oh hell just go ahead and get it. Fave track: ""Chicago""Highly recommended."
1,"One Illinoisian's Verdict: Dull, Vapid, Gimmicky","I'm completely astonished by the rave reviews for this album. Singer-songwriter stuff works best when the artist makes you feel he's singing about experiences or events that have greatly affected him. These dilettantish songs, on the other hand, sound totally forced, like they're based on encyclopedia entries (Or am I to believe that Stevens has strong personal feelings about Casimir Pulaski, Mary Todd Lincoln, Carl Sandburg, and the Columbian Exposition?).The lame lyrics could be somewhat forgiven if the music had a pulse, but this album is totally D.O.A -- no energy whatsoever, melodies that are completely innocuous and instantly forgettable.As for the song about John Wayne Gacy, Stevens is seemingly trying to be profound but in the end has nothing remotely insightful to say (Serial killers are people too? Wow, how heavy!!!!)."
2,I'm underwhelmed,"I listen to a lot of music, a lot, and when I started seeing this on DJ lists and reviews I took the leap of faith and checked it out. For the life of me I can't figure out why this is on the #1 slot of so many people. This put me to sleep after ten minutes. It just did absolutely nothing for me.Maybe I'm too particular about the type of music I like but there are so many better things to spend your money on than weak music like this."
1,Just Not A Fan,"This album is rated too high for what it is. There are indeed a few cool instrumental melodies, but like a few of the reviewers mentioned already is just has no soul to it. I would give it 2 or 3 stars but the overall rating is so undeservingly high I have to do my part to keep things in balance."
5,Fantastic..,"The cover art looks like high quality print, it comes with 2 vinyls and all the lyrics are printed on a cool looking handout. Any way, if you like Sufjan Stevens or Indie-Folk Music, you Def. need to get this."
1,Everyone you know is wrong about this album,"Astoundingly overrated, Stevens is a weak singer-songwriter who sounds here like a pastiche of James Taylor and Brian Wilson at their very worst. Lyrical conceits fall flat, and the overtones of born-again-ness are teeth-grating. The tunes are lackadaisical, half-composed at best. Nothing here has any energy, and I can't detect any real emotion or commitment here.I am at a loss to explain why this collection of mediocre-to-bad songs, performed and sung with a half-a$$ed attitude and no energy, has gotten so many good reviews from so many people. There is absolutely nothing here. Buying this is like buying a blank CD."
1,Doesn't make me want to visit Illinois.,"Slightly more ""umph"" than the Michigan CD, but still redundant and boring. A few clever and artistic moments, but not quite an entire album's worth. Playing a diverse array of instruments doesn't really make the songs any more musical. Overall, it's still a pleasant sounding and well-produced CD. Just too many 'da,da,da's, 'oh's, and repetitive chime sounds for me."
2,This is over rated fluff,"I think that the creativity and uniqueness of these wispy songs (all focused on Illinois issues) overshadows the basic premise of popular music which is that it must be listenable.This is a novelty work rather than a cd you can listen to repeatedly.It is not as good as depicted by the critics. There are some nice melodies, instrumental passages and ideas but this seems more like an experiment rather than a focused work.I respect the taking of chances but this doesn't warrant repeated listenings."
1,Brah?,"What in tarnation is this? And who listens to this? Are you like rolling down the street with your windows down. Yo check it. Sufjan...kicking it out. Heck no. I would be embarrased to have anyone see me and hear these sounds. It's like...I don't even know...like a bad production of Jesus Christ Super Star. ?I can't even beleive it. I feel like an idiot listneing to this garbage. Who rocks it like this.? Where do they find these people.And there are like mad people dying in Africa and stuff...what would they think of you if they saw you listening to this...They would know that they are really going to die. Oh no. Look at those crazy Americans. We are dead for sure now. No way they are gonna help us, when they can't even help themselves.People.Please."
2,oops!,"you must be american to like this stuff. probably, obviously. there is too lot of everything inside, this is too big, too full. if you like things like sigur ros, keep aside."
1,This is progressive rock...,"This album sucks. It's just prog-rock given the title ""indie""and suddenly everyone eats it up. It has way more in common with Yes or Genesis than anything that's real rock and roll. PRETENTIOUS!"
2,what about arnold,"i heard this guy wrote songs about states in the USA. why didn't he make one about california? with all the good things like Terminator and OC and LAguna Beach? i think if this man is going to make musical comercials to fly to chicago then he should pick somewhere better like california or idaho or delaware. that is my thoughts, it was just ok to listen to."
1,Overpriced and Nothing more then a binder with plastic sleeves,This item is nothing more than a cheap binder with plastic sleeves. They do not even provide the 2x2 coin holders for the price. I should have stayed with a Whitman!
1,link loss,"I am disappointed with the presentation of information in this book. In a word, it is horrible. It sorely needs an update. It was written in 1995. That makes it about 2 generations old as far as Network Technology is concerned. That is understandable, but it gets worse from there. Figure 6.1 Defined Ordered Sets for Frame delimiters on page 95 is incorrect and violates the Fibre Channel Physical and Signaling Interface (FC-PH) revision 4.3. The figures are sloppily drawn. For example, Figure 16.3 Loop Port State Machine state diagram, simplified has graphic which covers text. Personally, I find the diagram difficult to follow; others may not. The text may be easy to follow for those familiar with Fibre Channel, however, I am using this text to learn, and I find it more confusing than other texts. I think I have written enough to convey my opinions of this book. ;["
4,Comfy shoes,"My friends seem to all wear these shoes, so I thought I would give them a try. They are indeed very comfortable. I am a teacher on my feet from 8 to five daily, so comfort is my biggest issue, and looks the second biggest when it comes to shoes....looks wise I do feel like I am wearing my mother's shoes. I wore them the first time out of the box no problem, very comfortable, soft and feel good against my feet. Not as much arch support as I would have expected. Also wish that I had tried them on in a store first as they seem to run large. I wear 10 1/2...so in ordering the ten... thought that would be fine. Believe I could have gone with a 9 1/2 easily...or maybe it was just this individual shoe. I won't buy any more until I try them on in a store first."
3,Clarks Newbeat Sandal,"Average sandal, not as comfortable as the Clarks Sunbeat sandals which also fit my foot better. Though black leather was ordered, I received black nubuck. I decided to keep them anyway because of the low price."
4,An authentic piece of work from Drown,"I often get the impression that authors of character driven stories about poor, and consequently dysfunctional, families write from the comfort of their Soho lofts. Having first-hand experience at being down-and-out, I can say that Drown appears to really get it. The Hutchins' are good folks who can't seem to get a break. Worse, most of the people around them don't offer any breaks. Yet they manage to laugh (occassionally anyway) through it. So, even if Drown doesn't ""get it,"" he does a great job of faking it. And isn't that what its all about?"
4,meet me near heaven,"I can understand those who shrink from the unpleasant aspects of this novel's characters and their lives.So what.I think two things made this novel one of the most delightful I've read:1. Every character is allowed at least one paragraph of first person narrative. That was splendid.2. Brazen selfishness liberally poured over a dose of banal stupidity contrasts rather nicely with the pointless selflessness. The end result is a perpetual downward spiral of destruction of self, others and the inanimate. Mmm good humor at the expense of clueless characters."
3,Not the advertised picture,"The poster is entirely black and white. The picture advertised looks lighter than what it truly is. Johnson on the poster isn't blue, rather it is a light shade of grey and Jack isn't as bold as it looks. It came in good condition but nevertheless falsely advertised!"
5,"A pure delight, informative and yet easy to read","My daughter and I love reading this book! It's great to see real life photos of so many children from different regions in India. The illustrations are witty and compleement the stories well. My 5 years old was immediately drawn to it, especially to the kids braving the rivers, climbing the steep mountains, or drivinng for miles in the desert on a bicycle just to get to school. We learned so much (yet so easily) about the local foods, traditions, games, clothes and modes of transportation. You get to see the daily struggles children have to face, and you can't help admiring their determination and creativity in overcomming them.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested to learn about the kids' life, and point of view, in India. This is great research material for preschool and elementary classrooms."
1,Don't waste your money,This is the stupidest movie I have seen in a long time. Don't waste your money. Nothing like the original Stepford Wives movie.
3,Plasma ball,My 12yr old loves it. Its a little smaller than I would have liked. For the price its just fine and he was thrilled.
3,Great for toddler entertainment on plane,"I bought this to keep my toddler entertained on a short plane ride from Seattle to LA. Worked great, but didn't last long. Thought batteries died but after replacing, it turned out the lamp was just dead."
1,Hmmmm,Be advised that this is a BATTERY operated globe! Runs on 4 AA batteries. It does have a 6 volt adapter port but does NOT come with the adapter. I am disappointed that was not made clear in the product description. Oh Well
2,Okay,"This book is okay, but as another reviewer said there is a new Java edition, and plus there is no test taking tips. I don't know about you, but all test-prep books need study tips."
3,Barrons AP Computer Science Review....not that great,"good review of ap computer science course, but only has 2 practice tests for A and AB test each, so its 4 really, but only two for each course...also one thing it is missing that other books have and something that i can not believe they omitted is how the test is scored. they never mention a grading scale and tell you nothing on how its really graded...so when you take the practice test, you have no idea how well you did, it just has answers and thats it. i say that is very poor for a prep book to not tell you how well you might do on the real test. i would say the book is ok, but its completely unbelievable that they would forget adding this in"
1,SMS 2.0,This is used for SMS 2.0. The important thing is that SMS 2003 is nothing like 2.0 other than the SMS Installer. The Book is written in an old style not consistant with many other technical resources. If your looking for some basic introduction I would recomend the SMS 2003 Microsoft Press book. It would atleast give you a better overview even though it is outdated.
5,One of Pat's Best,"""We'll be together again"" and ""Footprints"" are my two favorite Pat Martino cd's. If you are wondering what is so great about Pat Martino, give these cd's a listen."
5,wow,Unbelievable!!! That's all I gotta say. This author did a great job!!It i hard to find a book that is this well written.
5,"I read this book 20 yrs. ago,and it still intrigues me!","""Serpentine"" may be the best book I've ever read.The fact that it is a true story, is chilling.Charles Sobrajh possessed genius qualities and intellect gone awry.He spoke several languages,had a chameleon personality and could blend with anyone or any situation. He had an animal's survival instinct masked by a suave persona. Charles Sobrajh was released from prison two years ago, so tourists... WATCHOUT WHO YOU BEFRIEND ON VACATION!!dmg"
4,BLACKS LAW DIC,"This is the short version good for your backpack. If you want the grandaddy for your law office, use the big bucks. Quick reference is good when you are away from your internet (Westlaw and Lexis Nexis)."
5,Just what we needed,"We needed just a small amount of netting for our small blueberry bushes. This was the right amount - and the price was right, too!"
2,Use common sense and save some $$,I have a grandchild who is a world class tantrum thrower. I got this book in hopes of getting some hints on how to handle her outbursts. All I got is yammering on and on about common sense things. Save your money and watch Supernanny instead. You'll get a lot better advice.
5,Without this book we would definitely be Les Miserables!,"I am a successful cartoonist who, on occasion, has to deal with four rambunctious children. While I believe most families are a little dysfunctional, ours sometimes becomes a regular circus! In the past, I would get so angry that I ended up having long visits with Mr. James Beam, (if you know what I mean); but now I never drink out of anger...only pleasure!This book has not only changed my life, but also my wife's. Her way of dealing with our melon-headed kids in the past was to compulsively clean. Now she and I can both relax in knowing our kids are in good hands with Uncle Roy.This book has shown me that you don't have to raise your children with an iron fist, but with hands of wood, me lad. And you won't have to worry about taking your kids to the shed, because they will already be on top of it."
3,Wide angle lens for the have nots,"I wanted a wide-angle lens for some while, but they were just too expensive. Plus, I had never tried a 3rd party lens with my Minolta, and was not sure what to expect. This lens produced results that I found quite acceptable. Like any cheapie wide angle lens, it is prone to flare. Oh, well. The edges do not appear soft to me, as I believe someone claimed, but I have not made any really large prints. One major downer is the very dull unimpressive looking plastic case. The picture at least looks like aluminum. The real thing does not. Also, I have not taken any pictures in the 30-35mm range (I have an expensive lens for that). If your Maxxum is one with a panoramic mode the pictures you take at 19mm will look pretty cool."
3,It was OK but....,"The produkt was OK, but it is a bit different compared to the picture. The top of the baby has more flat curves than the picture is showing, specially in the top + the head of the baby. It also looked very different from the side compared to what I had expected. It is about 3,5 mm (1/8 inch)thick.I didn't look bad, I didn't send it back, and I gave it to a friend for her birthday. So I liked the produckt, but was a bit disappointed about the differences compared to the picture."
5,One of the very best,"Jere Brophy is simply one of the best researchers in this field, and this book typifies his effective use of research in classroom application, as well as his user-friendly prose. As a former practitioner in the high school classroom, and now an adult educator learning more about research and its incredible value, I am convinced that this book should be in the hands of every classroom teacher and those of other stakeholders, with time enough to read, absorb, and apply. Our students would be in far better places than they are now. Brophy combines compassion, wisdom, practicality in all his work."
4,They work again!,I purchase this back up light switch for my vehicle after I had installed exhuast headers on my car thus eliminating the the linkage for my back up lights. Installation was an hour or so and the supllied bracket attaches to the 2nd gear stop bolt on the shifter itself. Amazon had the best price.
4,A good Book,"I like this book . Its clear ,easy to understand ,Its include many useful examples . Its helps developers extend their VB5 skills . The chapters about database r very good"
3,Not as great as at first glance,"At first glance this book looks like written for real VB developer with a good selection of topics(API,OOP,ASP and SQL server).And descriptive chapters (i.e. about data objects and SQL server)in this book are quite good , especially for a person who wants to take a quick look at these topics.But when it comes to code - this book isn't for nervous people.You should be prepared to inconsistency in variable names and omitting whole procedures while repeating others.It looks that there are more authors than 2 at a cover page.And even somebody declared some API functions in a way that differs from API viewer.I don't think these guys are too powerful to rewrite a Windows API. Unfortunately this problem is common for computer books nowadays.I'm still thinking about returning this book back - should we in some way stop this stream of errors?"
4,when you're allergic to cats you'll try anything once,"The wipes seemed to help quite a bit in reducing my symptoms although it's hard to truly judge the effectiveness when I combined this with some Zyrtec and an allergy spray for curtains and surfaces.Overall it seems to work, I'm not quite sure though if it's the product itself or simply the fact that you're wiping down your cat with a moist wipe :)"
1,a nightmare,we worked with him on his music video. It was the most unprofessional crew I ever worked with. The singer himself wasnt much better........
3,Needs a Glossary,"As an introduction to publication design the book is good.The only criticism I have is that there is no glossary or even an index. There are some places in the book where a term is introduced before it's been described so at times I was wondering if I'd missed something. The term is eventually described, usually a couple of paragraphs or sometimes pages later, so if you're not reading the book from beginning to end it can be difficult to find the place where a term is described.The book does not offer an exhaustive treatment of design principles and I will buy other books to learn more, but it's been a helpful introduction."
5,Powerful Prayers,"I love the format of the daily prayers in this book and the way that scripture is incorporated into the prayer as well as promptings for personal prayer time as well. This is a great way to have daily worship and prayer time, as well as reinforcing God's word into our memory."
5,Face to Face,I am very pleased with the book. It has changed my prayer life and the way I view God. The author has taken the work out of personalizing Scripture. The passages chosen are beautiful and so relevant for growing closer to and exalting God.
2,"Interesting idea, but the author gets so much so wrong","The most interesting thing about ""Semblance of Balance"" is the up-close view of a servant's life in the early 20th century. As for the more sensational material concerning Leopold and Loeb, the author gets nearly everything wrong--the nature of the relationship of the disturbed teenagers, their personalities, their motivations. I gave it two stars because I actually enjoyed the view of Elizabeth's life (the ""upstairs maid""), and her experiences as a recent immigrant in America. Otherwise, I'd give it one star. It's as if Neilson did little research into the lives and characters of the two young murderers, and just imposed his own characterizations and ideas. Being the descendent of Elizabeth Sattler (the afore-mentioned upstairs maid) doesn't give the author the right to distort history."
2,Nothing that Folger promises,"Note the ""Each edition includes:Freshly edited text based on the best early printed version of the playFull explanatory notes conveniently placed on pages facing the text of the playScene-by-scene plot summariesA key to famous lines and phrasesAn introduction to reading Shakespeare's languageAn essay by a leading Shakespeare scholar providing a modern perspective on the playIllustrations from the Folger Shakespeare Library's vast holdings of rare books""Only the first is true for the kindle edition"
3,The Abduction from the Seraglio.,"The Kostanze is disappointing in terms of pure vocal beauty. Sung in English. The liner notes include the whole English libretto, which is very helpful in looking for a good English version."
4,Car review,"Car runs and works great but I was really disappointed that we weren't shipped the black one that was in the picture. It came in an orange w/ a little black on bottom, but was not what was shown on the web.Helpful hint: there are more remote control chargers on amazon.com that are only $20.00, so go for those since you will not get the black one shown."
2,Buyer Beware!,"The car didnt work properly, it only went in circles. The package was new & it did not appear to be damaged. There is a ""wheel alignment"" button but it only caused it to circle from the left or to the right.NOTE: Colors may vary = It came in a hideous NEON ORANGE, what was up with that!The perk = the refund & return was easy"
3,It's OK.,"As written in previous reviews, the car that arrives is mostly bright orange with a little black across the top. And despite the measurements saying that it's 12"" long, it's more like 8"". Overall, it's not a BAD car, but it's definitely nothing special. It's OK for the price."
2,changes quality of picture,This screen protector feels good and goes on easy...BUT it changes the quality of the picture to the point of headache! It becomes blurry due to the matte texture and feels like I was dizzy looking at the screen. I took it off after a week....
4,For evangelicals studying theology,"My faith tradition is evangelical, but my formal theological training took place in a secular university and a mainline theological seminary. Even as recently as the last decade, the documentary hypothesis (for the Old Testament) and the two-source hypothesis (for the Gospels) are being taught as infallible fact, the only conclusion to be drawn from serious academic study. I was not aware that there are informed academic arguments to support the evangelical understanding of the Scripture until I read McDowell's book; what a pleasant surprise! I recommend this book to those of an evangelical faith who are engaged in the academic study of theology in institutions that perpetuate the rationalistic arguments of Scripture authorship; very useful to engage one's professors and fellow students in conversation, and not be coerced into ""selling out"" one's faith for a rationalistic, lifeless doctrine."
3,Very factual,This book has a lot of interesting and factual information for the person who either questions whether God exists OR doesn't know how to tell others about the reason why they believe God exists.
1,deception,"Josh McDowell is a master of deception.Let me copy his style:If Obama was God you would expect him to be:1. Mild mannered2. Try his best to help people have the health care they need3. Make an effort to improve education4. Have a friendly manner to all people of all races and religious beliefs5. Be eager to protect the earth's environment6. Wanting to wrestle money away from the greedy, overpaid, wealthy7. Having a good sense of humor8. Enjoy playing basketballNow I can write a book proving that Obama is all of these things so he must be God!~What a phoney! What is really sad is there are so many easily brainwashed people that will believe it all!"
5,Ecstatic with my purchase!!!! =),"I was so worried about receiving this dress in the mail. I was looking for a sexy club outfit not just some lingerie. Boy oh boy this dress was one hell of a pleasant surprise!!! If you have an hour glass figure this dress will make you look like a hot fox. Note of caution to some women!!!!! This dress in my opinion is not for someone who isn't fond of their back. If you have flaps or rolls this dress will expose them. You can't hide them with the upper strap which is connected to the dress. This item takes very well to a strapless bra and you need to find the right underwear to work this outfit right. =) I am so excited to wear this out!!!! If you are looking for an outfit that is eye catching, seductive for indoors and outdoors fun THIS IS IT!!!!"
3,Neither too good nor too bad,"It arrived later than it should be, after purchase, they take 2 day to prepare and ship out. Quality is ok, but material is not as good as I expected, feels cheap. But for this price it's ok. Can fits most people, but back is too low for short woman like me, I'm 161cm. Still sexy though. Not very satisfied for material, not as silky as ut looks like, and not soft enough to wear as lingerie(maybe I'm too picky?) for those who really like the outfit, it's not a bad buy. But won't be a good surprise either."
2,cheap material,"i bought this for going out for clubbing seeing so many great reviews and attracted by the amazing price.first, when i tried on, i thought what i pay is what i get.the design is really sexy and nice, but it was slightly large to me (5.3', 108lb) and the material looks cheap.i thought the material issue may be ok once u get into club in the dark lighten up, but i dont wanna wear it when it is bright outside because it gives me cheap looks. i guess im gonna return this."
3,Not for me,"I am a small & it is too big. It is bedroom sheer ;) creative style, jus need to fill it out."
3,like it,"its not very form fitting for me, I'm petite and i have had to modify it alot. one size doesnt fit all. the outfit is comfy and an eye catcher."
1,Like a baby doll,"Hate it! Maybe it is good for wearing at home.. But definitely, you can't go out with it. At least not me ;)"
3,OK for the money.,"I ordered this hoping for something sexy to wear out to a club. It fit fine, but was kind of see through over the chest. The material and way it looked made it look more like a Halloween costume though, so I sent it back. But for around $10, it's not bad if you want to just wear it around the house for your SO. It showed up fast, within 2 days."
3,sexy but not what it looks like!!,this looks great and the picture is great...but it was alot more see through than I was lead to bealive. The shipping was great and i guess you get what you pay for...not for outside the bedroom!
5,Cute dress,"Nice dress for the price. Very sexy with heels, of course. It would be nice if the back were a little lower. The material is made of the slinky material. It is thick, but not too thick. So, if you have too many bumps that you are worried about...this is not the dress for you. It is hard to wear panties with this due to the location of the openings. A strapless bra works well with it."
3,Not for everyone,"I was so excited to recieve this dress in the mail, but it was too big for me. I wear a size extra small/2 and the strap in the back was just bagging. If you are bigger than a size 2 then I promise this dress would look amazing on you!"
1,Kit missing a lot of parts,"Make sure you open the package and inspect the parts prior to attempting an installation as the ""kit"" we received appeared to be missing more parts than it included. For example, only one of the four springs was in the box, the greese was missing, etc. It looked as if someone either at Hotchkis or Amazon had simply repackaged a returned item and shipped it out to another unfortunate customer. That said, the few parts that were included (e.g., sway bar) appeared to be of high quality. Just a pain to have to return such a huge box (and an expensive item) with missing components and await a refund once the return is (hopefully) received ok."
5,Innovation,"This EP is very innovative glitch. It still retains an underlying background tone, similar to Oval, but much more energetic. The classical instruments and singing thrown in here and there add a nice feel. A great listen. Unique stuff, I recommend it to any lovers of this area of music (Oval, Autechre, etc.)"
4,Classic spy story in Yates mode!,"This was the second time I read this story and must admit that it seemed longer, somehow, the second time around. It's good to see Richard Hannay pitted against the 'Hun', once more. This time with a band of faithful followers to upset the Germans' plans of set the Middle East aflame with a 'Jehad'. Parts of the book bog down in technicalities of the Great War effort, but then, the story is being told by a soldier fighting said war! Hannay's storytelling betrays his jingoistic belief in the British Empire and British fairness and holds himself proudly as the pre-Apartheid South African that he is! In all, I thoroughly enjoyed the book and recommend anyone else to read it, the prequel and the 3 sequels."
4,"An fine cosy espionage thriller,","of the sort that cannot be written nowadays. (The modern equivalent would be seven times as long and would be a study in grey, as exciting as a slab of concrete.) Admittedly the book is racist. No, on second thought, ""racist"" is not at all the word. Buchan clearly thinks British culture is superior to other culture; but that's the sort of thing it's easy to live with in a book - and if he shows a lack of understanding of other cultures, well, a book of this kind needs villains, and it doesn't matter (for our purposes) if the villains never really existed. As for his view of Islam ... well, a writer is surely allowed to show contempt for doctrines, if not people; and, after all, he never does so in order to sell us a religion of his own. Despite the absurd things Hannay says he is clearly a man of intelligence - as is the author. This book is my introduction to both Hannay and Buchan. I hope to encounter them both again."
4,Greenmantle,In many ways this book is a preview of many of the current issues seen in the Middle East at this time. A good adventure story none the less.
3,Fitfully exciting but dates badly,"Dated and profoundly smug follow up to the brilliant ""The Thirty-Nine Steps"" featuring the same resourceful hero Richard Hannay. This time the story is set in wartime (WWI) but follows the same formula of a Hannay staying one step ahead of his pursuers through the most unlikeliest of means. Not boring but the smugness and chauvanism of Hannay and his companions becomes tiresome and date the story badly."
1,Good story but spoiled by promulgation of racism,"A classic tale of espionage and intrigue in the days of WWI. Unfortunately, John Buchan inbues his work with the Eurocentric racist views of the time. With the dehumanization of Muslims and Africans to ""savages"" and disdain for different religious beliefs this work typifies Apartheid doctrines. A good read if you are inclined to enjoy racism couched in the embrace of Catholicism and the ""superiority"" of the Aryan."
3,You need a lot of other stuff to use this book,"This book was great in theory, but you really need to either buy or have on hand a lot of unusual items in order for your kid to really explore all the spy science stuff listed in here. Quite a bit of it is quite lame... even for young kids. I was really hoping this would have some cool spy activities to do - ideas to explore, etc. If you're looking for a book that brings the spy game to the level of kids and breaks down the concepts and you're willing to go the extra mil and work with them through it all... this may be what you're looking for (hence three stars and not two). If you're hoping this is something your kid can do on their own... I don't think so."
3,a fairly good movie,"An okay scarey movie, but the story could be better. What I like about the movie is that it has almost no cussing, and only one minor word at that. I don't like the low cut dress they give the one lady. Like why do that in a movie like this? This is not a blood and guts type of attempt at horror, which is good for those of us who don't want to be looking at lots of gore. Whats scarey about blood and guts anyway? For those who want an okay scarey movie without sex and cussing, this is a good pick."
1,total waste of time!!!,Don't bother with this sucky movie!!!Story line was awful! To many different themes going on.
5,se,"Another winner....Of course the movies always diviate from the book a bit, but this one is still very intertaining."
2,It Was NOT Like The Book!!,"So... I read the book and thought it was EXTREMELY good. I got all excited once I found out that there was movie out. I mean, honestly... what could be better, right? The best book ever put to action?Wrong.This movie sucked beyond anything. It was NOTHING like the book. And when I say nothing, I mean NOTHING. They took out MAJOR parts, added new ones... the ending was all screwed up... I can't even explain it. the dining room scene, the boiler room scene, the end where they are all upstairs and they have to kill each other, Stephanie being locked in a clostet... it is ALL messed up beyond belief.Do NOT watch this film if you've seen the book. You will regret it big time."
1,Not even worth the free viewing,"Even though this movie is free I still think I paid too much. Did not like it. The acting was horrible, this movie had the potiential to be a great movie but it just fell flat."
2,Underwhelming until the final act; obvious but entertaining despite itself.,"This movie is both predictable and underwhelming, especially once you realize that you're watching a fairly basic Christian-themed parable (which one would expect based on who wrote it). While the film didn't hold my interest for most of the first two thirds, I stuck with it out of curiosity. The payoff in the final act was actually fairly engaging, as the characters get what's coming to them or fight their way past their own misdeeds. Overall I can't recommend it, but by the end I wasn't annoyed that I had watched it for free."
3,Definitly different,"The movie was okay, sound was a bit quiet and playback was good. Had a little bit of a twist on it so wasn't all bad"
3,"Decent Movie, Does NOT Follow The Book","I love the book House By Frank Peretti and Ted Dekker and I was hoping that since they made a movie of the book it would follow it at least somewhat. Needless to say, I was very disappointed; but I should have known because most movies don't. It is still a fairly decent film with some pretty good actors for the parts, if you haven't read the book or like to compare books with movies it's still a great buy."
3,A Time Killer,"No pun intented. The movie is certainly not the best ever, but for a rainy afternoon it was an enjoyable was to kill a couple of hours (pun intended that time)."
1,Less Than 1 Star,"I have read this book. It was the most inane example of ""horror"" writing I have ever tried to wade through. This author takes an awfully long time to get to the bottom line and while he's getting there it's just too disgusting and dreadful. I forced myself to read the whole thing because I couldn't believe I was reading something so disjointed and badly written.This movie, brought home by the spouse, was almost the worst movie ever. He liked it because of the grossness, but then he's a man. The ""actors"" were all second-rate; the screenplay was ill-written; the lighting was too dark, and the so-called action was too fast. It was like they all knew this movie was going to be super bad, and they wanted it over as quickly as possible.Bad movie; even worse book.Don't Bother!"
1,Terrible Representation of the Book,"I know generally it is difficult to follow any book to a T. But it seems as though the director made it his goal to ruin the book. Or he is just a moron. They also MAJORLY changed the ending, which is not o.k. if you considered this a decent movie, I recommend you read the book. I am very glad I only paid 2 dollars for this movie.I'm not gonna say how the book ends. If you are considering reading the book it is ten times better than the movie and worth reading.P.S. Still creepy but better.Kendall."
2,Scary and Creepy!,"This movie is one I thought I might like because I read the book and liked it very much. I quit watching halfway through. It was boring and creepy. Even though I had read the book I had a hard time trying to follow the plot. Dekker and Peretti are a great writing team but the movie industry did not do justice to this novel, but that's not unusual.Unknown actors and poor acting."
3,Mildly entertaining film,"House (which is not to be confused with the same-titled 1986 movie with William Katt, which is ultimately a better movie - note that the inferior 2009 flick is NOT a re-make) is part of the weird family / revisit-your-guilt-ridden-past / Satan worship genre set. It has decent production values compared to other such direct to DVD-ers (I assume it was direct-to in the US), and the acting is adequate.There is nothing original here, but that's beside the point; it is clearly trying to be nothing more than an entertaining genre flick, and there's nothing wrong with that. There are some creepy moments, especially in the first 15 or 20 minutes, and some interesting supernatural moments throughout; but it does not rank 4 or 5 stars because the characters and plot ""twists"" are too cookie-cutter, even for a genre flick."
4,The Goose That Almost Got Cooked,The story is about a goose who alawys did flips. So one day she got really tired and fell. Then she fell asleep and the next day she went to a farm. When she was there she almost got cooked.I recommend this book for kids who like adventure and like cooked goose! Michael F.
5,A History of Trout Fishing and Development,"TROUT, The Trout Fisherman's Bible, by Ray Bergman is a complete history of the author's immersion into the relm of matching wits with trout.The original 1938 publication has been greatly added to for the 1966-2000 revisions.If you like evolutions and history this is an absorbing book. I particularly like the late author's detailed descriptions on how he developed his respect and methods to entice trout throughout North American waters.The color plates of flies are beautifully depicted and the drawings of fishing techniques and knots are well done. There are some outmoded practices described, like using gut leader and parafin dissolved in unleaded gasoline to make fly cleaner flotant.Some of the author's fishing practices revived my appreciation of the legendary fishers in my family. It is a readable instructive book. I also liked the trade paper cover with a beautiful brown trout."
1,Garbage,"This thing is a piece of garbage. The handle broke off from the weight of 10 photos. The material feels like a door mat. The ""clear"" plastic pages are rough and make the photos look terrible. I have nothing good to say about this item."
3,Love the material - hate the background music,"I have come to know this material over the past months and have eagerly devoured it. So I was keen to find out more about how Jerry and Esther came to know Abraham. The interview is great stuff but I absolutely cannot stand the incessant background film music. The music seems so important to the director (and it IS film music, stolen from other well-known films), that it is credited BEFORE each section. It rises and falls, swells and eddies but of course it cannot do so in response to Jerry and Esther's words because it was composed for something else. It is a manufactured. pre-fabricated add-on to try to manipulate our emotions and we deserve better.Oh how I launched rockets of desire that this background torment would cease!"
5,Introducing Abraham DVD,Amazing to watch. Loved learning a bit more of Jerry & Esthers history. Love everything Abraham has to say....life changing stuff! My husband and I had goosebumps through most of it!
2,"Introducing ""Abraham""","Don't waste your money. I was optimistic about this DVD when Jerry connected the widely-read ""Think & Grow Rich"" book with his success. The piece loses all credibility when Esther takes on an inconsistent ethnic accent channeling ""Abraham."" The message is ambiguous, the story--goofy and fake. Stick with the well-articulated ""The Secret."""
5,Wonderful,"This set of DVD's gave me more insight into Jerry and Ester Hicks as people as well as new information from Abraham. I have the original ""Secret"" that includes Ester and Abraham but enjoyed this movie far more."
2,Disappointed,"After giving copies of ""Ask & It Is Given"" CD's and books to everyone in my family and friends as well, I was eagerly looking forward to this new effort. Sadly, it is just a rehash of the other book. Not saying the work isn't great - but it's just why pay $39.95 for something you have already paid for in a different title?That said, the Abraham works by Esther Hicks are delightful - they work - and I encourage everyone to buy their products. Keeping in mind that you probably really only need one version and that version (from my point of view) is ""Ask & It Is Given."""
5,There is a newer 4-disc version,There is a newer version with 4 disc's that I would choose over this two disc version.You really don't need both but the 4-disc set has more information.I highly recommend either but the 4-disc set is superior.
5,"Introducing Abraham - The Secret Behind ""The Secret""","this one gets 10 stars in my book. i absolutely loved this, have watched it over and over and over again. the music is wonderful the information incredible. definitely recommend this. very moving just incredible. shipment was so quick thank you!!"
3,pleased*,"good movie, not enough new questions asked!! good extras, producer waste a lot of time with little breaks/w slow spelling quotes- watch it if a friend has it- dont buy it if you even read one of there books because its really just a reveiw!!"
3,Interesting DVD,"I enjoyed this DVD but I thought the channeled interview was a little bit dull compared to the Law of Attraction DVD, which was much more humorous and exciting to watch."
1,Not worth the money,This was a repeat - I did not gain any information from this. I didn't care to hear about how they got where they are. I wanted further clarification on the process and it wasn't there. I'm mad that I wasted the money.
2,poor production and a waste of time,Read their book 2 times instead of wasting your time with this video. It is poorly produced and contains very little information.
1,"The Secret Behind ""The Secret""","Very poor. The content was all about Esther & Jerry Hicks--not about ""The Secret."" Also, it was not professionally done. The voices were poor quality. I would like to return it if possible. I understand you sell used discs."
4,Fine Quartet Recording,"Recorded at the same 1988 sessions as ""Ballads"" and ""Deep River"", this is another fine quartet recording by Murray. The title hints at the overall feelings of the tracks here. There are ballads but also a few rousing tracks as well. Like the others in this batch, a worthwhile purchase for the Murray completist."
5,Microbiology,Handbook of methods for microbiological quality control in pharmaceutical and medical devices
5,LILLIAN HELLMAN - OFF STAGE,"Elaine Strich becomes legendary novelist/playwright Lillian Hellman in this sometimes scathing, often tumultuous, frequently poignant account of Hellman's long term relationship with a man 25 years younger than she. There's wit, there's passion - all delivered by an A-one cast performing live in Los Angeles."
5,Let there be light,"Dont let the price fool you, this is not a cheap light. It is a soft light, love to type in the dark with this light. You get no reflection, you will never get blinded by this light by looking at it the wrong way. Perfect little document holder and light."
3,Eclipse Document Light holder,"This combination light and document holder was exactly what I was looking for...But it is just too heavy for the newer, thin monitors. It is supposed to attach with tape, but it doesn't hold. I wish someone could come up with a new design at half the weight. I really think there is a market for something like that...I am very disapointed, especially since it wasn't cheap."
2,The Belly of the Bow,All the good ideas and plot lines that you expected.....never quite happen. While interesting at times this is a mostly boring book. Lots of pages of nothing with a little action from time to time. It gets 2 stars only because those moments are pretty good.
1,Left me disgusted,"I will be short. I actually liked the first book. New author for me, interesting characters, interesting plot. I think the siege part was overly simplistic - how could the clan, that supposedly new nothing more complicated than a wheel, in just a couple of months learn and build fairly advanced seige engines ? and what, only one guard was at city's gate, obviously most vulnarable part of city's defence to allow the bad guy to finish it all in a few minutes ? But anyway - the first book was ok.And this, second one, was more or less OK too, until that bizzare turn in the end that left me totally disgusted with the only male persona in this book that I could simpatized with. I think the author completely lost it here - it was absolutely out of character of Bardas and totally uncalled for. It's too bad I bought the 3-rd book already. I have now no wish whatsoever to read it, and am very much disappointed with the author.1 star - for making me puke."
1,Optical mice owners move on!,"Even though there is a claim that this pad works with optical mice, it isn't true. I tried it with an optical Intellimouse and a Logitech cordless optical, neither worked. The pad itself is of good construction, it just doesn't do what it claims."
2,Villains To Depraved,The book looked promising with a nicely detailed scene at Almacks.....until the heros brother and sister-in law's depravity came to light. They spend most of the book trying to abuse the heroine and her friend.
5,So Amazing!,"The Low Life used to be a band from the Washington DC / Maryland area who created amazing music. Their albums included a lengthy EP, Thixotropic, and Daisy Cutter. They also released three live albums.Thixotropic is arguably their greatest release although it's hard to say one is better than the other because they're all amazing. From start to finish this album is guaranteed to leave you wanting more and will surely add you to the masses that pray for their return.Everything about this cd is amazing and if you don't own it you should try your best to get it."
2,Not as thick as expected,"My boss wanted some new door signs. We have some that are thick and some that are thinner. Our local stores had only the thin ones. That is why I was excited when I found these. Yes, I took a ruler to the ones we had ordered years ago. The thickness was the same as the ones we wanted. However when we received them they were the same thickness ( or rather thinness) as the ones in the local store. I guess they must not make the heavier quality anymore. That's fine I just wish they had not been advertsied as such."
3,you get what you pay for,"Ok, so let me start off by saying for $100 this is a great buy. but as the title suggests you do get what you pay for.PROS:5 megapixels = very good image qualityGreat Value!!Pretty user friendlyeasy to turn on and shootCONS:NO OPTICAL ZOOMDrains batterys very quickwith flash on it takes a very long time to prepare to shootflash does not have good rangei have had this camera for about a year and a half and im pretty satisfied"
1,Non user friendly camera,"This camera is so complicated to use that I have not been able to take photo's or videos since it was purchased. It drains batteries so fast one cannot even turn on the camera to take photos without replacing with new ones and even then, one keeps getting false readings of ""low battery"" even though I have a battery checker to make sure they are in full power. It has been more than three months since this camera was purchased and neither the store nor the company will entertain a replacement. Am I upset......you betya!"
5,GREAT and FUNNY gift basket!,Bought this for my mom's bday saying wish i could give her a million bucks for her bday but could only afford this. She loved it! Thought it was hilarious and made for a fun bday present.
2,Value not there,This is the third year I have given package gifts to my business partners. I have had trouble finding enough value in these so that I feel good about giving them. Neither the size nor the presentation of this package had a value close to what I paid. Another disappointment. They did arrive in good shape and timely.
5,Delicious Basket of goodies!,"Excellent Basket. My dad loved it. I gave it to him for his Birthday. Unfortunately, it was so good, that he didn't share with me. I took a few chocolate chip cookies and shortbread cookies when he wasn't looking. They were good! The basket looks small when it arrives, but it has numerous goodies in it. Would recommend highly."
3,Not what I expected from CMT,"I bought 2 sets of these, figured I couldn't lose for $22, These are good steel but not very sharp in fact some have some good burr's on them, they will take some honing before install.Can't beat the price though."
4,New metal...you bet.,"One of the best new metal/rock bands I have heard from in a long time. Great guitar, reminds me of the crunchy, tap your feet groove of the Scorpions, along with excellent vocals make this a great effort. The songs stick with you from Wrecking ball to the rhythmatic All is not forgiven. Great hooks and nice lyrics. If you yearn for a better time, when music was fun and made you want ot whip out your air guitar...Talon Rocks."
4,Love it,"This product works like a dream! I won't go into any specific details, but my husband and myself are quite pleased with it.The reason I gave 4 stars not 5 was because of the mint flavored one. I would recommend being cautious with this one because it does have the menthol, cooling effect almost to the point of a little burning sensation."
5,Highly Recommended!,This product is definately worth the investment! -- Numbs the gag reflex and is definately a great seller!!!5 Stars.. Highly Recommended..I no longer buy or sell the big tubes of Good Head! -- These small travel sizes are the way to go because they fit inside your purse or travel bag!
3,Thick & Sticky,The flavors are good but the mint is a little too tingly. It's a thicker consistency than you might think.
1,garbage,This product was garbage took long to arrive for being a pen the pen look nice in picture but was oh so 99 store quality just cheaper than imaginable the pen didn't work to begin with tried to open it to Comment if I could fix it. It was held together with scotch tape. parts started to fall off as soon as I opened it just a waist of money time so disappointed just plain garbage.I would of returnd it for
5,The security book I've been looking for,"This book explained to me how to solve the problems that I deal with all the time in my job. I like the fact that someone took the time to think about the reader and not to focus so much on all of the esoteric aspects of security that you find in most books. I already loaned my copy out to a colleague, and I'm recommending this book for everyone."
1,Incomplete and dated,"I bought this book along with many others a while back. I am a network security consultant. I wanted to broaden my skills a bit and make sure my knowledge was up to par with others in the field.I found this book very incomplete and dated. Most of the information was relevant about 5 years ago. Since then tatics and technologies have changed rather significantly.For example, the book does not even mention intrusion detection systems. This is a staple technology of the security community and any hacker worth his weight would focus a great deal of energy on circumnavigating or overloading these devices.Also, the book treats firewalls as the ""end all be all"" of network security. Which simply is not the case. Firewalls are important, but certainly not the only security product you implement.Pass this book by and go for much better books such as Hackers Challenge or Know Your Enemy by the Honeynet team."
4,Great toy for puppy,"Our Catahoula puppy loves this toy and we love to use it to wear out his energetic little body. He has been chasing and retrieving it for 4 weeks now and it is still in really good shape. He is 12 weeks old now. We do not let him chew on it because it will not hold up to that. This gave us the frequent opportunity to practice the ""drop it"" command. Our pup loves it and it is his favorite outside toy. He especially enjoys heading at it in a flat out run and try to scoop it off the ground to bring back. Overall a great toy, just do not expect it to hold up with a chew toy's durability."
2,hyper disc,"I bought this for our golden retriever, it flies well, is very lightweight, but very quickly had teethmarks though the material. If doggie doesn't use his ""soft mouth"" this toy will be destroyed in no time."
2,disappointing,Box states it will play OS X 10.3.9 or later. But with 10.6.8 it will freeze on any effort to change the game preferences and one has no access to any of its on-line features. Not worth the money.
4,Great ram for the price,"I have never installed RAM before this but I must say it was EASY to do. I did go onto DELL's website prior to doing so, so I would have instructions, just in case. They really weren't necessary. I just popped out my old RAM modules and popped these in. Just make sure they are completely pushed down in the slots or your machine won't recognize it. Also I wasn't aware that my pc would ask if I wanted to enter SETUP when pc was booting up after powering it back on -I said yes, that way I could see if it recognized the new RAM. It did and I was good to go."
1,INCONFORMIDAD,CUANDO ADQUIRI EL PRODUCTO DECIA QUE ERA DE 2 GB ES DECIR 1 GB POR CADA MEMORIA PERO EN REALIDAD LLEGARON FUE DOS MEMORIAS DE 500MB
5,memory,"It's memory. What else is there to say?? :-) Works well, speeds the processing up and works as advertised. Excellent."
5,Works with Optiplex GX280,"Excellent product, my old Dell Optiplex GX280 recognize the ram immediately, kingstone is real quality so i recommend u buy this product if u need ddr2 sdram at a cheap price and great quality"
4,very interesting.,"this book is very informative on how castro orders his underlings to embark on illegal activities,but lets them know if you get caught your on your own.a prime example is the execution of ochoa,de la guardia and the other two.i wont give it away,but if you know a little about the revolution this book will pretty much fill in the holes that surrounded that tragedy.good job jorge!"
5,Best way to cover up your Wrangler's back side,"After you complete the set of three (Windjammer, Duster and sun bonnet) you will find that this will give your Wrangler the best sport/offroad look. The only down thing is that you will have a two seat vehicle and you will have less leg room for driver and passenger once you push the seats a little forward.Other than that this set has been the best order I got for my Jeep yet."
2,The Missing Link,"I admit it, I'm a skeptic. Usually, I can fathom astrological jargoneers and come to agree with some of their theories. I've even managed to choke down Crowley's florid, rambling prose but this book was virtually indecipherable. The premise of the subject sounded interesting but, after reading it, I'm still not sure if the author had something interesting to say, because of the unclarity of his thoughts as they are presented by his prose.I didn't see anything legitimately psychiatric presented in the book, and before anyone interprets my opinion of what constitutes ""legitimate psychiatry"" allow me to offer that I am critical of modern psychiatry, so am open to more interpretations of ""legitimate."" The promise of the title is not present in the book."
2,Vague & Confusing,"I've studied astrology for 20 years and have a tough time making heads or tails of Dr. Gibson's system. The biggest problem is that he gives no real standard for the various disorders such as anxiety, depression, etc. He merely lists a number of indicator aspects (ones virtually everyone has a few of), but doesn't say how many factors are necessary for a strong disposition to the ailment. Instead, he merely gives a few case studies.His concept is interesting, but needs to be fleshed out. I'd say this book is a good first draft, but much more research and explanation needs to be given for the general public."
2,"Close, But No","When I read the other reviews, I wondered if these people read the same book I did. I thought this book was difficult to understand, and, from my views of astrology, narrow-viewed. It places planets in the old black and white catagories of ""good and bad"" aspects. Also, I tested my family's charts for these aspects of mental illness. There were very few aspects as described in this book, yet one person in my family has ADHD, and three have been diagnosed with related disorders (Tourette's Syndrome). Something's a little off here..."
1,don't buy,The one I ordered lasted maybe a week before one of the straps broke. It really is a useless product.
1,Don't bother with it,"If you were only to read the first chapter, where Wieviorka explains his psychology-based theory on the evolution of terroism, this book would seem like an excellent source on the psychology of terrorists. Unfortunately, the rest of the book only serves to validate a hidden agenda. Reading closely, you find that the theory he so carefully lays out in Part 1 is used throughout the case study analysis to invalidate the groups being studied as ""terrorist organizations."" -- in short, he says that they're not terrorists because they don't match his psychological work-up of terrorist groups. These groups include: Hizbollah, PLO, ETA, and RAF/Red Brigades"
3,It's okay,"This is a pretty basic CD tower. It's inexpensive, and it holds a good combination of CDs and DVDs. Unfortunately, it's rather flimsy. Unless you glue the wire rack to the base, it will fall apart if you try to lift it. It also topples over easily."
4,very easy to set up and flexible storage,"I bought one of these a year ago, and have really liked the fact that the spaces will hold up to 5 dvd cases, so I can store sets as well as individual disks. Also, I don't use this as a carrying case, so I have had no problem with anything coming apart. In fact, I like it so well I have just ordered another one."
2,dwt108 double wide 108 disc dvd tower,Was a little hard putting it together. You have to be very careful taking the cds out or it would fall apart. I am not happy with this product.
2,Flimsy and fills up fast,Disappointed when receiving this I asked where's the rest of it?. Not at all sturdy until DVD provide stability. Don't do it.
3,Does its job,This stand is good. It works well with CD and DVD cases. The only concern is it's rigidity. If you stack your media from top to bottom it get's kind of flimsy but still manages to stay up. I've never had this DVD tower fall even with people constantly bumping into it.
2,No Edge,"I had listened to and even saw Y&T in concert but never was much of a fan. I bought Meniketti's last solo,On the Blue Side, really liked it and was hoping for something similar, maybe even a little heavier. Have to say I was a little disapointed.Most of the songs are weak and boring. If your like Dave for his singing and song writing buy the album but if you like ripping guitar licks skip it."
5,Awesome!,"Wow! Fantastic CD! Just what the doctor ordered in these weird musical times. The songs on this CD are all excellent - I must say that I pretty much like every song (which is not something I can say about most CDs I buy these days). Too difficult to choose favorites off of this CD, as my favorites seem to change each day! It's like I'm addicted - I just have to hear this CD every day. I crave it!I love Y&T, but I must admit that I am really getting off on Dave Meniketti's solo material. I highly recommend this CD!"
5,Meniketti Rocks!!!,"The title says it all. I agree 100% with the other reviewers that this CD represents the best of Dave Meniketti to date. Superb musicianship and exceptional production quality all the way through this one. Fans of Dave, Y&T, and/or those who long for the days of old when melodic rock was not some sort of dirty word, should really get this CD."
5,Meniketti Vocals & Guitar playing still the best!,"Y&T; has been a favorite of mine for years.I saw them open for Twisted Sister in NewOrleans 83/84 then on the farewell tour4 times then just flew to LA for 3 showsand it was worth every penny! This guyis the most underrated vocalist/guitaristin hard rock & this shows he's still gotit! Messing with Mr. Big & I Remember& Tough Luck Ave & All in this togethercould be Y&T; songs. Love the keyboardsin Together! Also No Lies, Hendrixstyle song Storm is brilliant. TheOther Side is great slow bluesy side.This is an incredible album & the moreI listen I can't understand how sucha great guitarist/singer is ignored.This should've gotten tons of airplay.I can't wait for new Y&T; album! ThankGod Y&T; and other real rock band likeUFO, KISS, Motorhead still releasenew material! Rock isn't dead butit's dying so Keep rocking Dave!"
5,"Superb, Dave Meniketti is a true talent",Dave has done it yet again. I own every Y&T album and now both of Dave's solo releases and I have to say that this is by far Dave's best work. I have been a fan of Dave Meniketti since 1980 and have never heard him play with more passion than he does on this one. All the songs on this CD are played with the true emotion Dave has been known for the past 20+ years. This is truly a must have. Excellent job Dave.
2,Ho Hum for Meniketti,"After the unbelievable ""On the Blue Side"", and the previous Y&T stuff, I expected alot from this new release. Unfortunatly, this cd does not stand up and deliver. It is not that the cd is bad, just not as good as we have come to expect from Meniketti. Some rock songs, some blues songs and some mixed, but never really nailing any song. The vocals are very good ( as usual ), but the songs seem to lack heart. As a virtual ""rookie"" release for Dave with his new band mates, this cd does show promise, and I look forward to any future releases, but this cd won't get much play time in my cd player."
2,"Dave, please get Y&T back together.","I am a huge fan of Y&T and Dave Meniketti but this album was quite a disappointment to me. Nothing on it is really bad, but by the same token, nothing on it is really good either. It is mostly just kinda boring. Dave plays well as always and his voice still seems ageless, but the song are completely unexceptional. Nothing to grab your attention. I really wish Y&T would just reform and go back and listen to all the great stuff they did back in the 80s and early 90s. Just do more of the same. For classic Meniketti get the Y&T albums Black Tiger, Meanstreak, In Rock We Trust, Down For The Count, Contagious, and Ten."
2,Written for educators not parents,I bought this to educate myself on what truely makes a great school. This book did not help me it is written soley for use by educators not parents.
4,Research into Action,Data is the buzz word of the schoolyards. This book had easy references and good practical insights on how to look at data.
2,mislabeled film,"This film is mislabeled by Amazon. It is NOT the film with Yamaguchi Momoe as indicated, but rather the more recently done animated version."
4,Wonderful product; very comfortable,"Not crazy about the faux-leather, but it's very comfortable and easily moldable to your body. I really like this bag! It's fairly heavy duty also."
5,Bean Bag,"I won't know how nice this product is until after Christmas when my little Grand-daughter opens this, but I assume it will be great, as has been all of my other Amazon purchases. :)"
2,Disatified.,The bean bag was a recommendation by a Registered Ocupation Therapist for my grandson who has autism. The chair is to firm to provide sensory stimulation that we had hoped for. Pat Gordon
1,Quality Bargain Mall sucks,"I have still not received my book from QUALITY BARGAIN MALL, even after the confirmation of my complaint 11 days ago."
4,A New Twist to Santa Fe,"I ordered this book based on the fact that I have been to Santa Fe a number of times and wanted to see what Stuart Woods would spin on this one. I was not disappointed. I have read about 10 of his books and I thought this one was one of my favorites. It is very fast paced and Stone Barrington reminds me of someone I know. Loved the Jewish Ed Eagle. What attorney could spin a web better than him. All of Woods' books, especially the Stone Barrington series, are very good. I like the way Woods has knowledge of the geographical areas he has portrayed in his books. Interesting, savvy writer.Louise KrautheimMechanicsburg, PA"
2,Oh Come On,"Very disappointing. Stuart Woods can be very good. That's why I read him. Chiefs, Grass Roots, and Run Before the Wind were excellent. Other books have not been so wonderful and this was one of them. I kept finding myself saying, ""Oh come on"" way too many times during this book. Wolf doesn't seem to have a conscience, and I found it hard to find any redeeming qualities in him. This book was just too slick, and the characters way too shallow. Your wife is just killed, so you fly off to L.A. to finish a script? You start an affair? What's missing from this picture?"
5,Grabs you at the first and doesn't let go.,A story that makes you wonder if you are awake or having a nightmare.. A wonderful story told only as Stuart Woods could tell.
3,It was OK.,"I wasn't too impressed with Chris Claremont's ""Uncanny X-Men - The New Age Vol. 3: On Ice"". Most of what he wrote in the first 3 volumes of ""The New Age:...X-Men"" was mediocre and a rehash of a rehash.The Savage Land has already been stomped over many times by Claremont; however, I am glad that he created a new enemy the Haukka. I also like a few twists that happened, but the twists don't really seem logical or feasible. Knowing the pasts of different characters, I don't see how easily certain individuals could get caught up in a trap with the experiences they have.For any die hard X-Men fans, I'd say read this book. For the casual reader, other than maybe a new enemy, I don't really see anything coming from this story line."
1,So disappointing!,"Wow was this bad. I was so hoping to like it as I love some of these characters so much (especially Rachel Summers!). Unfortunately, these characters act out of character throughtout and ignore past history and relationships. The X-Men run around like chickens with their heads cut off from battle to battle spouting the same Claremont cliches that they've spouted 100 times before. If you really want to read the legendary Chris Claremont, track down the reprints of X-Men #94 - 200; unfortunately, not even the gorgeous Alan Davis art makes this book readable."
4,"Great Content, Somewhat Repetitive","Great alternate view of mental health. It seems that every mental health practitioner has his/her set of tools and their practice is limited by what is in their toolbox. This book describes a set of tools that every practitioner should consider adding to their toolbox and every patient who has exhausted ""conventional"" mental health treatments should seek out.The contents of the book are somewhat redundant. It could be edited down about 20% with no loss of content. But the value of the content makes it worth wading through the extra verbiage."
1,So boring,"The DVD quality is very poor and Moria is very boring. She's an old lady so not motivating for me. Although this is sort of instructional, you'd better check one from library or DVD Rentals. If you're interested in working out with resistance band, try these:1)Brand New [...] Plus Pilates - Janis Saffell2)Denise Austin: Power Zone - The Ultimate Metabolism Boosting Workout3)Pilates Bodyband ChallengeAll are available at Amazon.This Moria's Stott Pilates uses 5' long resistance band but Janis uses 6'.

5,REALLY COOL COMPANION BOOK FOR OTHER 2,I really enjoyed this book and it along with the other two I order are close at hand at all times.
2,A very old idea dressed in new clothes.,Nothing at all new in this book. Any experienced knitter hasbeen there before. Pretty colours & glossy pictures do not addup to a worthwhile book for knitters.
2,Disappointing Book,"I ordered this book online b/c I have been wanting to try out shadow knitting and couldn't find it in any local bookstores. Once I got the book home I realized it just wasn't for me. There are lots of patterns for sweaters, vests etc., but nothing that I would ever make or wear. I was hoping for more info on the tech. and charting your own patterns. My brother commented that it was a big book full of ""Cosby Sweaters."" I'd advise looking though the book before purchasing."
1,Extremely Disappointing,I made the mistake of buying this book without looking through it. I wish I had. I would never make a single pattern in this book. All of the sweater designs are completely unflattering: oversized and boxy. And all of the illusion designs are simple geometric shapes. Nothing is different or interesting.But worst of all: there is no clear section on how to make your own illusion patterns! Luckily I have since found a website that has a tutorial. This book was a complete waste of money.
2,"Ho, hum. . .","I was rather disappointed with this book. I had done shadow knitting once before, and was really excited wondering what this book had to teach me. Alas, the answer was ""not much."" Ms. Hoxbro has taken what is really a very simple technique and makes it seem difficult with all her ""must do this"" instructions. I did modify a jacket pattern to make a scarf, but other than that am unlikely to make any of the projects. As others have mentioned, they are all just too geometric and, well, boring really. The photos do not best show off the illusions, either."
5,Jimi meets Coltrane,Is this the type of music Hendrix and Coltrane would have played if they were alive in the mid 70s?Its not music to relax to with its strong edge.The bass and drums exchange leads with the sax and guitar.No one instrument is leading but the band is tight.Ulmer is on fire riffing even using the wah- wah .Almost an hour of excitement.Even the slower tunes cook.Only for experienced listeners.
1,Its Junk!,"Don't buy it! you breath on it and the stupid thing falls over, dont try and put any DVD's in it or it will fall over, worst purchase ever!!!"
3,pretty good...,"This is a cool introduction to the amazing and obscure world of 1970's and early 1980's Ausie punk, pop and garage rock. If you don't own the early Saints records or Radio Bird Man's "" Radios Appear "" LP this is a good starting point. There are a lot of other cool sounds on here too from bands like The Scientists, The Victims and THe Psycho Surgeons. The real highlight however, is the brilliant teen punk-thug antics of the one and only Fun Things. ""Savage"" is a rip-roarin' slab of rock'n'roll godhead!Other than the bands mentioned above, the rest of the album consists of some pretty week 1980's wanna-be, retro, psych, pop and soft ""garage"" stuff. The Murder Punk compilations cover a bit more ground and feature the complete Fun Things recordings. So, if you like real rock'n'roll grab Murder Punk Volumes 1 and 2 and wail daddy, WAIL!"
1,the led does not work and wont charge :/,i was trying to charge it the led wasnt on and when i shook it a little you would hear something moving around
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!,this came to my house in two wekks and when i tried to charge it five minutes later it was melting!
4,Portable Gamecube,"This piece of the portable gamecube works very well to provide power to the Gamecube and the Interact Mobile Monitor (Sold Separately). It can be charged off of the gamecube AC Charger that comes with the Gamecube or a DC Charger (Sold Separately, Mobile Monitor has one). I am a little upset about the 1.5 hour battery life, but if you have the car DC or the home AC charger, it is fine though because you can charge the battery while playing (make sure switch is on when charging and playing, off if charging only). The wires it includes is the built in power to the gamecube and the circular mobile monitor (will add image). Overall I am very happy with it, one star off for short battery life."
1,Art Explosion Label Factory Deluxe,"Oh, how I wish there had been a customer review when I was thinking to buy this label maker. I researched as much as I could from Art Explosion's website, asked a co-worker's opinion and in the end purchased and hoped for the best. The wizards program is useless for my needs, and I also had trouble with shrinking the font. The clip art is childish and simplistic and the font selection is the same variety that comes with any new computer except less of them.Unless you want to make *cute* labels for jam jars, leave this one alone. I really regret buying this product."
3,A Winner,"I absolutely love this program. It enables you to make labels of all kinds which come in handy in my ""unorganized"" life. I can use the label maker to make labels for my business and any cds I burn (which I really love to do). Definetly a plus! :)"
2,A guide that needs much more work and accuracy...,"The Beijing City guide, is one of poor quality that lacks a lot of information, I was just this past Christmas and New Year on a holiday trip and I was frankly disappointed. These guide included some really inaccurate information on restaurants, the maps are totally inaccurate and the information given is scarce. I really expected more seriousness in this guide -being a Lonely Planet one- that leaves me asking why is Lonely Planet guides so popular? With the maps on this guide instead of finding my way, I got lost! As for the information, it was OK but just imagine trying to find a restaurant that does not exist. Well I think there might be better guides out there."
1,LP guide to Beijing,"I have used this book on a six day trip to Beijing over Xmas 1999. In my opinion the July 1998 edition of this book is too far out of date, and contains an unacceptable level of inaccuracies and inconsistencies. I would also endorse the previous reviewer's comments about the tone of the book, although I would say that a 'right on' sneering attitude seems to be written into too many Lonely Planet books and Rough Guides in general. This book is not worth buying in its July 1998 (3rd) edition. It needs to be completely rewritten and not reissued in a 4th edition."
2,"A snide, critical book for those not planning to visit.","I have been a big fan of the LP guides, up to now. I have used them for more than ten years, with great pleasure. This one takes a snide, critical, wiseguy tone, as if the writer didn't really like China much and thinks you won't either.Guides are supposed to show you how to enjoy a place, not load you down with critical material. A sadly deficient departure from LP's previous level of quality."
2,Beware!,"Many of the things that I tried to do in Beijing failed because the book was inaccurate. Because there has been a lot of construction and renovation in the city since this book was published in January 2001, Lonely Planet's Beijing is already out of date."
2,Very Disappointing,"As a fan of LP I was very dissapointed in this book. It seems like the person who wrote this book has been living in China for a while and is not particularly interested in seeing the sites around town. There were plenty of places to eat, stay and party, but not a lot about the amazing things to see in Beijing.For examply it had good instructions on how to get to the summer palace, but no info on what you were looking at once you were there, compared to Egypt guide (for example) where you could happily wander around a temple and happily feel that you don't need a tour guide to tell you anything, the Beijing guide had a paragraph or two saying this building and that building are nice.Also very dissapointing was the history section, As the capital city of a coutry with so much history, old and new, I think that it deserved more than 3 pages."
1,Pile of Junk with a Mind of it's Own,"This might be the biggest pile of electronic junk I have ever bought, and I have bought a LOT of electronics. This thing powered up but that's about the extent of it. It NEVER functioned properly...stopping recordings on it's own in the middle of a recording, saying disc was not recordabe...then recording on it (for a while) before stopping the recording in the middle of the show! I trashed a boat load of DVD's trying, praying, hoping this machine would come through but it was a dog that never performed one trick...except maybe play dead."
3,nave's Topical Bible,Nave's Topical BibleCan't really identify where you are in the bible (what book?) Must scroll to the nearest book beginning
1,Not helpful,Very hard to use and not very helpful to me.It is very confusing and complicated to me.Poor choice on my part.
3,Topical,"Good quality considering it's 14yrs old. Apart from a name on the inside cover and a couple of markings on some pages, i'm content. This was a bit of a result for me. Been looking for something like this for a while, saved a bit on this one.Sounds similar to THE SUBJECT BIBLE that i was close to buying only this was a bargain price."
1,NAVES Kindle Version,"Nave's is a great topical reference, but this Kindle version does not have a table of contents which makes referencing any book difficult, but is especially troubling for a reference work. Don't waste your money on this title."
1,Nave's Topical Bible for Kindle,This purchase was a waist of space on my Kindle and a waist of money.No table of contents or easy way to do a topical search for anything. You must use a tedious scroll at best to find anything. I will delete this and anything else setup like it from my Kindle. I see no benefit to keep this on my system.
2,Not user friendly,"I bought this, in the hope of using it as a concordance. It was difficult for me to look up words."
1,Not well written,"Did not have enough of the scriptures broken down at all. It was sort of written like a preface, instead of a topical Bible. Whoever wrote it, wrote it in a rush."
3,good,the bible is old but in good condition. It will serve it's purpose for a class but the pages smell.
1,Don-da-Don-Don............Don-da-Don-Don-Don!,"I wish the author well in his persuit of fame and fortune. Don A Rickels benefits from having the same name as the famous comic, however they are both different people. I am a professional Comic, Producer, and Public speaker. I tend to have very high standards for all material I review. The information in the pamphlet was not very helpful to me. I was disapointed as I expected the real Don Rickels to have written this. That is why I bought it. I intend on sending this pamphlet(it's not even a book) back. - Good luck, and if your a comic, keep going on stage, and ask advice of other comics always."
5,It sucked. It wasn't worth $22.25. It was too long,I can't believe I wasted that much money for such a boring book
4,A Woman in the Woods,"This memoir was first published in 1960. Margaret Felt recounts the 10 (1944-54) years she and her husband Sonny operated a gyppo salvage logging company within view of Mount Rainier in Washington State. She played many parts - camp cook and flunky; cleaner and painter; bookkeeper; hiring agent; truck driver delivery logs to the mill;grocery and parts buyer;hauler of heavy broken parts from cats and other machinery; and wheedler of creditors as they spent each year in debt, but keeping their crews paid off and their equipment and logging camp in order. All this during a time when women had returned to their homes after World War II to become the perfect wives and mothers. Oh, she was also the mother to two girls. She had spunk and she loved the forests, despite the fact that her husband ""barbered the green mountains"" for a living. I enjoyed it very much.Author of A Devil Singing SmallThe Wolf's Sun"
5,Sinfully Seductive,"6 Stars...I don't own a VPW500 but I can tell you that if it's in your price range, one look might be all it takes to get you to bite. I'm amazed by what TV designers have accomplished over the last few years. Based on what I've seen while shopping recently, the VPW500 would be one of my top choices if price were no object. But it's way out of my price range, unfortunately. The size, coupled with the brightness, contrast and color density add up to a very convincing watching experience. It gives the illusion of depth that you just don't come close to achieving out of a conventional TV and in the process, tends to pull you into the program. It's almost like information overload. Sitting 8' away, it still is plenty large enough to occupy nearly all of your visual attention. I think I'm in love."
4,A well rounded view of Civil War medicine!,"Gangrene and Glory is a great book covering just about every aspect of medical related issues in the Civil War. It covers key players in the development of medical affairs while bringing forth quite a bit of information to many subject matters. For example, some of the subject matters consist of Confederate/Union healthcare,development,training,medicine,supply,diseases and surgical procedures on and off of the battlefield. Interesting stories are added to certain areas which enhance the book, plus there is mathematical data to back up the chapters. This book is a must read for those interested in medicine and medical operations during the Civil War. It is a somewhat fast read, though gets to the point and has many pictures and is thoughtfully easy to read."
2,Gangrene and glory,"I bought this book from Amazon. I have one word for it "" Boring"" . Wow, talk about a dry book. If you are looking for a good read pass this one bye ! I really enjoy reading about the civil war . I guess if you are looking for some facts then this book might help you. Other than that I suggest you move on !"
3,Not what I was looking for.,The information in this book was helpful to me up to a point. But my research required much more detail. But a overall good book.
3,good but not very good,good book. but I'm sure they could make it easier. I'm not sure if there is more good books.
1,Medical Genetics,"This book is extremely limited in discussing how these genetic disorders manifest themselves clinically. I would not recommend this book for students who plan to apply their knowledge in the clinical setting. Explanations of certain genetic terms are not always clearly defined nor are certain biologic processes such as meiosis. Overall, a poorly written book for anyone but a graduate student of genetics."
4,Good review of medical genetics,"I did not select this book, it was required for a class I was taking, but it is a well written book. This book offers a good review of medical genetics at a moderate level. It features ""case study"" areas about some individual genetic diseases (i.e. hemophilia) and is user friendly."
4,yAy textbooks,The book reads very well for a genetics textbook. The pictures helped explain some concepts and the questions at the end of the chapters were a nice summary.
5,Medical Genetics,The book arrived as specified by seller with no problems. It was shipped fast and arrived in a timely manner. Much appreciated!! Book is simple to read and understandable.
2,Don't bother,"I picked this book up from the library on a whim. The cover had a glowing review from Nora Roberts, so I thought why not? Let me tell you why not. The dialogue is trite. The plot is boring. Leigh Evans, the main character, is immature, brainless, and cold. She treats her father like dirt for, as a turns out, a very lame reason. Likewise, she takes her anti-men stance too far with her love interest, Michael St. Claire. If she were a real person, I would feel sorry for her family and friends."
5,One of the best books I've read,"I love historical fiction, especially when the epilogue tells what was fact and what was fiction. This book was great and I was sure that many of the exciting parts had been made up. I was thrilled to see the wealth of research that went into the story. The author stuck to the facts and the suspense grew all the way to the end. I hope to see more books by this author. I would also love to see this book in a hardback format."
5,A sleep denying thriller!,"I love spy novels, especially those set in WW2. Invitation to Valhalla is a book that will keep you up at night regardless if you have to go to work the next morning or not. Wow! I certainly hope the author has a sequel in the works."
2,Snore. Middle.,"Good start. Long foundation, but so darn long to get to the point. Nothing intersting for lord knows how many pages. Heroine, snore, no twist, nadda. Snore snore. One I pushed my way through as I can't buy a book and eventually read it. I hoped it would get better, but no. Trivial historical references are childishly done to interest you in this story. I wanted it to be better."
2,Hit and Run,"This book has been very spotty for me. When I started it I was captivated but as things progressed it started to fall apart. Iv'e stopped reading it, then started it and stopped again. I've had to stop reading it numerous times, there are some aspects I just can't agree with. I'm not a history buff so I can't say anything was inaccurate. Everything to me just seemed too perfect. It was not very creative and I feel it only dragged on. I picked up this book thinking it would be a nice spy thriller, something suspenseful that I could read and be captivated by but I'm halfway through and nothing interesting has happened at all. Nothing. It's just not interesting."
5,A Page Turner,"Once I started reading this book, I could not put it down. The author does a wonderful job of creating suspense without adding gore. Although it carries the label of novel, it is based on a true story with extensive research, which shows. I highly recommend it."
4,None,This was a fun read. I was hooked from the first pages. the characters and subject matter kept me interested and the plot developed nicely so I had difficulty putting it down.
5,Fantastic Book,"Easily one of the most entertaining books I have ever read. It's filled with interesting details about the times, has great characters and doesn't slow down. It was worth every minute of sleep I missed. His squeal to this book, Blood of the Reich, is just as good."
3,Curiously flat retelling of perilous times,"The author deserves praise for an obviously prodigious amount of research on the Nazi heirarchy and the case of Erika Lehmann. However, the book veers between the tone of a novel and that of a documentary. Sometimes this works, as when Heinrich Himmler is dealing with an administrative issue, and you realize, My God, he's matter-of-factly doing paperwork for a concentration camp. And there's one scene where Hitler, Himmler, and Goebbels are all in one room, and the reader wishes the roof would just fall in then and there. But the characters seem one-dimensional in many scenes; for example, what are we to think of Erika Lehmann ? She seems to move through the novel like a robot."
2,Uncle Adolf?,The book is well written but it bothers me that Hitler is portrayed as almost a sympathetic character.
1,DB2 Answers! : Certified Tech Support (Osborne's Answers Ser,"It is not for you, if you are not using DB2 on OS/390 and you are not an absolute novice to the Database world. It talks only about the IBM Mainframe, does not cover UNIX, NT and OS/2 well. Does not cover any topic in substantial details.I am a DBA on the IBM SP/2 and I did not get what I was looking for."
2,So-so chiller tries but no cigar,"An unjustly hanged ferryman (played by Charles Middleton of Ming the Merciless fame) lurks around as a ghostly presence in the swamp where he was executed and takes revenge on those responsible. However he doesn't appear much since, for the middle half of the film, he is absent apart from two spliced in close-ups. Almost atmospheric chiller set in the Louisiana swamp on a painfully small budget (the ferry goes about 20 yards and almost all of the action is confined to one set) with a lot of religious symbolism. Most of the footage is taken up with Blake Edwards (future Pink Panther film director) romancing Rosemary La Planche who somehow loves the horrible swamp and has taken to running the ferry. This has a cult reputation but is really not all that good since the horror element is missing from too much of the film and the climax has La Planche running everywhere only for Middleton to pop up at all corners (yet he still can't find Edwards)."
3,"Gibson's a star on the rise, but this is slow","Mel Gibson's star grew from this film where he stars as an Australian soldier who with his mate, (Mark Lee) can't wait to join the fight against the Turkish during WWI. One can see that Gibson was a star on the rise, but much of this film moves along slowly, until it reaches its battle scenes. There, the madness and brutality of war is revealed."
1,Gallipoli-False History.,"The Australian movie Gallipoli has a false and slanderous ending.No British officer ever ordered Australian troops to commit a suicidal dash against the Turks.This is false history.The movie's statement that quote-""the British troops are relaxing on the beach""unquote while Australian troops were dying is particularly slanderous when you consider that Britain lost more than twice as many troops at Gallipoli as Australia and New Zealand combined.Gallipoli continued the chip-on-the-shoulder mentality of Australian filmakers against Britain.I am Australian born to Australian parents so my opinion is impartial."
4,"A very disturbing picture of how the Brits used the Aussies, Kiwis and others as Cannon fodder during W.W.I ...(pls. read on...)","Also in W.W. II with Brit Gen. DickieMountbatton, but I'll save that for abook review on that subject. When Melgets strafed at the end, it brings thepoint home. Expendable is the best wordI can think of to describe the what hap-pened to the flower of Aussie men's youthand there is a monument to the men lost,unneccesarily in the stupid runs up theenemies guns in this Military disaster!Churchill, then a Brit Lt. really screwedup here! Read my book review, unless youra Brit-O-Phile supremicist!"
3,Rent It First,"This is a rather slow-paced movie - the characters' pre-war background life and military training take up the majority of the movie. Mel Gibson himself doesn't show up until about 15 or 20 minutes into the picture, so if you're watching for Mel, be patient. Probably those reviewers who went on and on (and on) about the historical accuracy, real or imagined slights to British honor, casualty rates, etc., should have remembered most people aren't watching this movie for a history lesson. I think, if you haven't seen this movie before, you would be better off renting it before you buy. Just because I found it boring (and I'm a WWI historical buff) doesn't mean you won't find it moving."
5,Great!,I love the movie. I can watch them over and over again without being bored! I highly highly recommended it!
4,A great film,"The film Gallipoli is a great film and should be seen by anyone who would like to learn about the harshness of war. Like any film, it has innaccuracies, such as the exaggeration of blame shouldered upon British officers. Whether the mis-timing of the run at The Nek, allowing the Turks to get into their firing positions was entirely due to a watch which didn't read the correct time, I cannot be sure. The sheer bravery that was needed for soldiers to run to their inevitable doom was high, and many Australian and New Zealand men gave their lives and careers to go and fight. However much over-dramatisiation there is in Gallipoli, it is required to teach the world of how cruel, harsh and needless war can be."
5,Enlightenment on tape,"I have recently finished watching and studying Gallipoli for my English class at school. I am a proud New Zealander, and what happened at Gallipoli is a part of my heritage. Any normal person will feel sad for the men who died and their families, and any moral person will know that it was a tragedy of the inhumane kind, but it was only after watching this film that I fully understood why we commemorate the day the soldiers' fate was sealed. This film is a masterpiece in the finest sense. I loved every minute of it, every line, every close up of a soldier who knows he will soon die, and most of all I love how for the first time in my life, I am still moved by a film, 2 weeks after I watched it."
5,A Different Point of View at the Great War,"Not only did this movie make Mel Gibson a star, it shed light on Australia's point in WWI. And what is great is the movie does not surround the Great War, but the Great War surrounds it. You find two friends in the outback, looking for adventure, but find only horror. One of the greatest war films to date, and one of Gibson's finest performances."
4,A great war movie.,"This was a fantastic movie with tons of action and adventure. The movie is based around two boys who get together after a race. They then go on a whirlwind adventure until they get to the battlefield at Gallipoli where no amount of training could prepare them for what would happen. I liked this movie for the most part, but the music did nothing for me. A better soundtrack would have added a whole lot more to this movie."
5,"Powerful, Heart wrenching","Incredible effort by director Peter Weir and a very young Mel Gibson. A powerful statement on the futility of war and the terrilbe toll it takes on youth and innocence. Stunning cinematography and great acting, highlight this tale of the ill-fated Austrialian attack against the Turks during WWI. Two friends enlist hoping for adventure and glory, but learn first hand the horrors and helpless of war. If you liked Saving Private Ryan, you will love this film. A epic movie that that is hard to forget, with a gut wrenching finale. See it!"
1,crappy film making at its best,made in 1985 this film wants to make you believe it is a war movie. Hardly. the battle scenes are less that 10 percent of this film. But what do you expect from a Rupert Murdoch production? Truly poor film making. Mel Gibson not withstanding (he does a decent job) but I can't say much for the rest of this film.
3,New York Afternoon,"Where can I get hold of album ""Keeper of the Flame"" by Richie Cole, I am after the vocal track New York Afternoon with Eddie Jefferson. Can anybody help."
4,JVC KD-DV5100,"I've only had this installed for a few days, but I'm impressed by its capabilities. Its great to be able to play homemade CDs and DVDs. However I have one disappointment. I like to play recorded messages, ie. speeches or sermons. I record these with MP3 encoding. Since these usually last more than 30 minutes, and since my trips around town are usually less than 30 minutes, I never get to the end of one of these messages. This machine will not permit fast forwarding (or backwarding) of MP3 tracks. It will also not remember where the playback stopped (when I kill the power), so that it may start up again at this point. These two functions will work with CD tracks, however. I guess the remedy is to break up the messages into 5 minute segments, so that one can jump to the next track if needed.Otherwise, its a good machine for the money. The installation went very well in my Dodge Caravan."
3,"Interesting, But...","Not something I would normally read, but why not change things up from time to time? Overall, it is very engaging and McKenna presents some interesting theories. I am not sold on the main point, i.e. that psilocybin containing mushrooms played a part in human evolution and are the foundation of the first religious experiences. They undoubtedly played a part in specific shamanistic cultures since the Neolithic period, but he falls into the same trap as Marija Gimbutas (who I was not surprised to see cited in the book) in jumping to conclusions without any contextual proof of their interpretation of artwork from lost cultures. Nonetheless, I found some of the evidence compelling and enjoyed the read."
5,Terence McKenna Greatest Visionary Mind of 20th Century,"Mr McKenna's writings flow so smoothly that it is impossible not to read him. The thesis is developed thoroughly in breadth and grows forward with coordination and poise that allows one to read through scientific supporting terminology which one is technically unfamiliar with and still get the greater concepts and conclusions. He is truly the reincarnation of James Joyce as a scientist in pursuit of the understanding of Life. One readily realizes that there is nothing more important than understanding who and what we are and Terence has given us a clear view of a loving world culture that fits the planet like a glove. The buddhist embodiment of wisdom and compassion for all. What an amazing book to read and read again. If there is a savior for our Life form on this planet, it is the late Terance McKenna."
5,"Excellent, but too much info for the Average Reader","This is a fascinating world history told through the eyes of the last leader of the psychedelic community. McKenna argues that, before the onslaught of the current dominator-model of society, humans lived in happy partnership, united in their love for mother earth. The key to this society was the ingestion of magic mushrooms, a psychedelic plant that offers its eater a view of a benevolent, beautiful and inherently vegetable mind -- the necessary vision for life in a partnership model.McKenna makes a valid argument and the book is filled with very interesting ideas, though the middle section is bogged down with shred after shred of ""evidence"" pointing towards ancient mushroom use. This is a truly great book, though Archaic Revival is a much easier and enjoyable introduction to Terence McKenna and his outrageous yet convincing ideas."
2,"Revolutionary!!..well, sort of.","Mckenna definetly has some thoughts to share. Thoughts awakened in the midst of a psilocybin-induced state of euphoria and terror. I think Hunter S. Thompson said it best--you can't buy enlightenment. You can't pick it in the forest either... The idea that a mushroom (or any other psycedelic) is some kind of extraordinary gateway to another dimension or key to the underlying nature of the universe violates the nature of what we see around us everyday. Its just not that simple, and its apparent that those who buy this book still wishes it were. but I must say in its defense that the stories are fascinating, mystical and nearly-convincing to the uninitiated. its an interesting idea that most of us would like to beleive. But insight comes from struggle."
1,The easiest way to sell books is by making outrageous claims,"McKenna is one of the most misinformed writers I have ever read. He has no grasp on the evolutionary process. He makes assumptions on important subjects with little or no scientific evidence. I'm not complaining that he tries to qualify the use of hallucinogens, I'm all for it if that is what you want to do, I only wish that he would not mislead the reader by simplify what are very complex ideas. McKenna has built is argument on sand as anyone who looks into the subject will find."
3,My Perspective - 22yro from Seattle,"This book helped me satisfy much curiosity over these interesting drugs and their history. However I didn't end up sharing Mckenna's viewpoint in the long-run. Instead I was able to move on from this youthful obsession. Looking back, this book was probably the most fun to read non-fiction for me and I don't regret reading it at all. Definitely a fun reading experience, but in light of further investigation I personally didn't find it totally convincing. But that's ok! It helped me move forwards in establishing a likalbe/concrete perception of existence and entertained along the way."
5,Food of the Gods,This book is amazing. It's easy to read and interesting. The anthropological work is easy to understand and seems reliable. It's not hard to put remember the chain of events to re-tell others.
5,I love his thesis as it shows respect for the feminine.,"As a 39 year old lifelong feminist, I was impressed by the true respect McKenna shows for the feminine (aka Mother Nature, Gaia). Plus I am enormously impressed by the elegance,lucidity and poetry of his natural science-based thinking. Of most importance for 1999, I believe, is his outlining of the lost partnership model of society as opposed the the inevitable burn-out of the dominator model."
2,A disappointing effort.,"If you are looking for a book with useful trading insights, look elsewhere. The book consists of brief and shallow interviews with traders, which while interesting, don't provide much in the way of novel trading ideas; most all of this has appeared elsewhere. Several of the interviews are nothing more than trading system vendors touting their own systems. The author even interviews himself! The book could also use some more careful editing; for example, the author recommends a book, but gives the wrong title and misspells the authors name. If you want to read about traders in their own words, stick to the ""Market Wizards"" books."
4,Nice insight from real traders,"Wow! this book has some bad reviews. I am really surprised, perhaps some of the reviewers really expected to be handed a real trading system for 29.95. The book jacket definitely over-promises based on what is inside, but there is still tremendous value in here. If you look past the blatant attempts by some of the interviewees to market their services and take the nuggets where you find them then you will have not wasted your time.I know several of the traders interviewed in the book. They have reputations that span the spectrum. But the really outstanding interviews were of the traders that you don't find interviewed in other texts. The nameless Phantom, CV, the Committee and Mark Brown interviews come to mind. They are worth the price of the book. The pit stops are also useful, but in some cases are found in other texts"
1,Total waste of print and time,"It's amazing what this guy attempts to pass off as value. First of all he represents he is a trader of reknown. This is total rubbish. Being from Chicago myself I knwo that this guy is a total charlatan and he never made a dime trading. He was a part time trader on the 'baby' mid america exchange. It is equivalent to playing the penny slot machines. The interviews he conducts are made with traders who are of higher stature than the writer--I use that term lightly--but that is like calling a midget a giant since everything is relative. I would like to write that I axquired one morsel of information from this book but all I got was worthless words. I cannot recommend any less this book. Instead of even reading it, I recommend you pound your head against the wall since that would be more gratifying."
4,Great Storage Solution,"I've never been too picky about my DVD storage. Ove the past several years, I have purchased about 5 different shelves/towers for DVDs. This is one of the best. It has plenty of storage, and it is easy to access all of the DVDs. I've used these for about two years now with no problems. I definitely recommend."
2,Way too small,Not really sure how 20lbs could fit in this. More ideal for traveling. Not big enough as a storage container for a large dog breed.
3,From the author,"This book was originally written as my M.A. thesis in Public Administration at the University of Virginia. During the transition I had an opportunity to interview some officials in the early Reagan Administration, and to contrast their views with those of the outgoing Carter people.If you would like to purchase this book, but are having difficulty finding a copy, feel free to contact me directly by e-mail at <kolya@uri.edu>."
5,Painter X,"Painter X is an amazing product by itself, team it with Photoshop and it becomes 10 times beter."

1,cheap quality,"I would not recommend these trees for outdoor. They fall apart with the wind, discolor and tip over easily. I put the into another pot so the wouldn't tip. However, the quality of the leaves are poor for outdoor."
1,Do not buy!,"This keyboard is flimsy. On the one I bought the keys stick. It is horrible to type on. Sorry to be so negative, but this was a terrible waste of money."
5,A CDPD Reference,"This is a fantastic technical resource for understanding the basic and fundamental concepts of Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD). Wireless Data technologies is a growing field and this book outlines the architecture and protocol to send data over the CDPD infrastructure. No matter how technical you are this book provides background information, specifications and protocol structure. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking at wireless data and CDPD technologies."
2,"Had trouble getting them to fit, punctured","I bought a set of these several years ago, and had trouble getting them to fit on the rims on two different bikes. It was hard to avoid a flat spot where the tire would not sit in the rim, as if the tire was just a bit too small for the rim.I also had one puncture pretty early on riding on a gravel bike path, nothing too crazy. This was a complete tire failure, not just a hole from a nail. End of tire, no repair possible.You get what you pay for, and you can buy better tires for a little more money."
2,Cheap wheel with problems,"WHAT I LIKE:- Very cheap price.- Treads are deep for decent traction. Seemed like it would be good as a snow tire on my road bike for the winter.WHAT I DISLIKE:- The wheel material is very crappy and will break easily.- The tire came deformed, with a huge bump on the sidewall (see photos). Probably caused by the cheap material and make.Would not buy again."
5,skinny knobby fun,"These tires were a great fit for old road bike rebuild. Was looking for something little less racy and small, but not too fat mountain-bikish (the photo actually makes it look a little wider than they really are). Great in-between for 1-1/4 wheels! Definitely right price, and gumwall looks super cool on my black rims (Alex AP18's-see my review). Will look to how they hold up over time."
2,Low Quality,These tires are not the best out there. I bought them for the winter months because they had more of a mountain bike tread. The problem is they are not that well made. They are all out of balance and made it feel as if my front wheel needed to be brought to the shop. After switching back to road tires I really found out how bad these tires where. I'm going to skip these tires next year and go with my slicker tires.
2,Not for Summer Time!,"They don't hold up well during the Summer, when the pavement is Hot! The heat causes the Tire Tread to weaken and bulge, in several spots, and become progressively worse with continued usage.You cannot use these tires in places such as California, Arizona, New Mexico, or any part of the country where heat from the pavement will destroy them."
4,Great if you are on a budget,"I have a really old ten speed that I ride with my son on paved and crushed limestone trails. My old road tires were great for the paved trails, but on crushed limestone the bumps from horse hoof impressions were killing me. Instead of buying a new bike with shocks to replace my old 27"" Nikishiki frame, I bought these tires to give me a little more cushion. I did notice some uneveness on the first seating, but a short ride followed by deflating/reinflating evened them out. They are a great budget buy, but I would recommend Amazon review what box they ship these in. I swear the two I ordered were shipped in a box that was 6"" x 30"" x 50"". My wife though I bought a new bicycle when she saw the box. Great for the price, but be prepared to spend a little extra time seating them on the rim."
3,David is not happy.,"David Cook is very dismayed at the prices being charged for these CD's. People are being ripped off. Unless you want to pay these rediculous prices for sentimental reasons, I would suggest you find a place to ligitimately download this music. I should say that some sellers are donating proceeds from their sales of Axium recordings, and Analog heart to charities, and that's okay, but be careful who you buy from. David loves his fans, and is just looking out for their best interests."
2,Not much history on the F-16,I bought this DVD hoping to learn more about the F-16. But it is actually a well put together presentation of Aviation history up to the F-16 but very little is mentioned about my favorite fighter jet.
2,Not quite for me.,"I have had a gold chain for my reading glasses before, but somehow this one looks too feminine for my liking. I am sure I will find a use for the chain some day, but not for my glasses."
3,OK for Nursing Theory,An OK book if you have to read theory... It's much more simplified than most theory texts and makes the content easier to analyze.
5,The Truth about Teaching,"Gillian Robert's has given the best to date! ""Adam and Evil"" is a thoroughly intriging and honest work. The story's theme touched the heart of this high school teacher's experience and frustration when attempting to aid a student in crisis. Along with Ms. Robert's usual gift for brilliant writing, the reader is treated to an insider's view to the struggles a teacher sometimes encounters when stonewalled by parents in denial, the administration, and the law. From the first two chapters, those who know Mandy will be desperate to get to the end to discover the changes she may or may not make in her life. Brava to Gillian Roberts and I am eager to begin her newest work, ""Helen Hath No Fury""."
3,This Pepper needs more spice . . .,"For the first 50 or so pages of this book, I kept thinking to myself, ""I've read this book before!"" Well, yes and no. I hadn't actually read this title before, but the previous book in this series, THE BLUEST BLOOD. I think one could be excused for this confusion when the heroine is a high-school teacher, involved with books and writing, and her live-in is a cop. And when the plot involves troubled teens, books, protesters and murder, well--confusion would seem to be a logical outcome.Once I realized I hadn't read this book before, I slogged on, but with no appreciable degree of interest, and finally gave it up. I realize the author is highly regarded--and indeed I really liked the first book, TIME AND TROUBLE, in her new series.This one, though, left me cold. Amanda Pepper definitely needs more spice in her life."
4,"Good overview of the Emerson business planning systems, but could have included some more interesting stories!","This book clearly lays out the Emerson business planning model, which is the process used to run the business. I work at Emerson, so i aready know a lot about this planning cycle. I think the average reader will not find this book that interesting, but it will useful to know the great information inside it. I wish that Mr. Knight would have shared some more stories about inside the board room and some of the more exciting history of his career. It would also have been interesting to get more about what he personally went through at Emerson and before. Finally, he should have included more about management and the HR side of developing the people."
4,A system for good business,"For 43 years, global electronic giant Emerson delivered consecutive annual increases in earnings and dividends per share. The end of this winning streak in July 2001 hardly tarnished the reputation of one the world's most admired corporations. Charles F. Knight, the second of only three CEOs since 1954 in the company's history, explains in detail how Emerson built its success by meticulously planning and executing its management system. Few companies can match Emerson's accomplishments, yet you can apply the fundamentals of the company's system to most organizations. getAbstract recommends this book to managers looking for successful models and others who enjoy reading about big winners."
1,Unintentionally hilarious!,"OH my, I weeded this one from my high school library this past year, and every page has a new gem, such as this great caption: ""The California Gold Rush brought visitors galore"" and ""Many a woman had to learn the art of camp cookery.""The juvenile writing along with the crude illustrations and hilarious captions make this one a book worth looking at for a good chuckle. Just don't expect anything up to contemporary history standards."
2,Zen?,"Seeing the warm recommendations here I ordered the book and read it. Not that I didn't like it, it's a simply knit and idealistic tale of liberation from (any) oppression, but the allegory is farfetched a lot... I've found a few sayings and descriptions resembling Zen somewhat, but it reminded me more of the Positive Thought movement - ""If you can imagine it, you can do it!"" - and of blunt proselytizing. The intention is good, no question, but - no, I wouldn't recommend it to Zen newcomers, and not to the experienced either."
3,forro-experience,"I bought the album a couple of years ago on a trip to Brazil. As listened to various forro-bands on my trip and the music style was very popular in the norteastern part of brazil, I got to like it. Without knowing previous songs from banda magnificos I bought this album --> and I am really glad I did that. It gives you a unique look on forro music."
3,confusion,I'm pretty sure I already did this product review. Maybe you guys sent me the same thing twice. That must be it. Or may be it was the guys who sent me the CD. Way too much communication going on.
2,review sucks,don't you think would be nice to know the length of this cable? I think Amazon shouldn't allow sellers that don't detail their products to post them.
2,Lost interest after 50 pages or so...,"I haven't finished it. I expected a light, humorous mystery, but it was TOO light and fey for me. I wasn't interested in any of the ridiculous characters, and I haven't wanted to pick it back up and find out what happened to any of them. I like classic British mysteries by Christie, Marsh, and Tey and I like humorous mysteries like Mortimer's Rumpole of the Bailey, but Branch's style didn't do anything for me. It almost seemed like she was trying to be a slightly darker version of P.G. Wodehouse (who I love) but it didn't work, in my opinion.In the unlikely event I finish the book, I'll post another review."
1,Please enter a title for your review,"British music gets worse every month. I don't know how they keep the downward slide going, but they do. You'd think at some point the UK divisions of the major labels just wouldn't be able to find any bands in their country that were worse than the ones they'd already signed, the lameness would plateau, but they manage to keep finding worse and worse bands. Even if I tried to write the worst music I possibly could I couldn't write music that would be as offensive to my ears as this band. They make Swans, Whitehouse, Shellac and Nickelback seem like amateurs at the art of being unlistenable."
3,Battles that Doomed the Confederacy,"I found this book to be very enjoyable reading. The book goes into depth about the battle that occured at Chickamauga and Chattanooga, but does not require the reader to be familiar with Civil War history. I found this book to be easy to read as well as enjoyable. Unfortunately, Bowers writes with a sympathetic viewpoint towards the CSA and goes into detail about Chickamauga (which was a confederate victory) but barely gleems over the battle of Chattanooga. good book for the lay reader, but you historians and civil war buffs may be disappointed."
3,True to the Original,"Of the translations that I have read this is the most true to the original words. It is a prose translation, so Donaldson did not need to select words based on their sounds and could get the meaning more accurately.The exactness of the translation makes this language sound archaic.The footnotes are quite helpful, especially when going through the difficult passages at the start of the Dragon story that describe the wars of the Swedish succession.Read this translation and then try a poetic translation such as Heaney's."
2,Book Lacking Some Top Attractions,"Unfortunately, Frommer's NS, NB, & PEI Tour Book lacks some top attractions. For example, it is unforgivable that it does not mention Founder's Hall (one of the best museums, if not the best, devoted to the history of Canada)on PEI. Another example is its failure to mention Woodleigh (recently out of business due to the illness of the owner, but in operation when the book was published), also on PEI."
2,Dissapointing for a Frommer's Guide,"I usually like the Frommer guides, but felt that this guide was really lacking in many respects. Both the Moon Atlantic Canada and Lonely Planet guides provide more detailed information. We are going to Nova Scotia and PEI for our second visit and wanted more information on the specific sites, accomodations, and restaurants. This guide doesn't list as many towns in the regions and therefore lacks associated info. While I purchased this guide for the previous trip, I will purchase the Moon guide for this trip."
5,"Frommer's Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island)",My daughter and I found this book indespensable while on a recent trip to Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. We especially found it useful in determining sights of interest to us. I give it high marks!
4,Nordan makes you reconsider the obvious.,"Lewis ""Buddy"" Nordan is an excellent author. The stories contained herein are at once thought provoking, stimulating, sometimes funny and sometimes serious. I have re-read them many times. Nordan deals in a reality which is sometime his, sometimes yours... (When in fact you can grasp it.) Though it is sometimes a macbre world, it always makes sense. From the hidden Elvis suit to the midgets, Nordan makes you feel comfortable, only to surprise you. This collection is fabulous in my opinion, but it is hard to be specific as to why, because that is the style. Read it...You'll be better for it. Nordan's southern roots run deep and there is a story to tell there wheter it be part fiction and part non-fiction, or a delicious mix of the two. A good book!"
5,A course you can trust,"This course gave me what others failed to. I felt that the author was always with me, informing, guiding, anticipating my problems and providing answers. Dr Cook must be a very good teacher!You can go as far as you want, use the first units just to get by or go through the whole book. You can stop where you want and still have learned something. Pronunciation, grammar and vocabulary are very clearly explained. I strongly recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn Portuguese, for Brazil, Portugal, and some countries in Africa or anywhere else where the language is spoken."
4,light weight / low price,Good thing about this lens is low weight. Worth buying for such a low price.
4,Good looking piece but a challenge to assemble.,"This is a very fine looking piece of furniture for the price, but it was so heavy that the FedEx guy could barely get it in my door. It was a good thing I was home to accept it! It took me about 3 hours to put it together. I guess I should have read the description more carefully because I was shocked to see so many pieces! I only wanted the smallest width size so there were 4 extra very heavy pieces that I didn't need. The glass shelves were extremely difficult to handle because of their weight. I would recommend having 2 people for the job of assembly. I stuck with it and was proud of my accomplishment. All the pieces were well marked for assembly and the directions had almost no words, only pictures."
4,excellent sound quality and good power,"A good system with superior sound quality at this price range and good power output. Beter or comparable sound quality to ""Designer"" systems with molded plastic folded internal ports at a fraction of the price.Spring clips for speakers and substantial powr output maens after market speakers can be used, and spring clips for the FM antenna means roof or large wall dipole antennas can be attached.The CD changing function is rather loud, but in all other respects this system is nearly flawless for the money.Highly recommended for relatives who pine for designer radios."
4,Amazing,"This Sharp mini system is got to be the best mini for under 130 bucks on the market today. I tested 4 other models (Sony, RCA, Panasonic, and Magnovox) and none of then came close. First off, this system is more powerful then you may think, even though the other systems I tested (all were in the 99 to 199 range) were rated at higher wattages, and they were either distored at high volume, or didnt have any volume at all. The sound is so crisp and clean and for such a small system it has some very nice bass reponse. It has a set of rca jacks on the back for easy hookup to your cable or DVD or whatever aux you want to use. It even has a subwoofer input, but I highly doubt you would want to buy one since I think this is more of a bedroom/dorm/Kitchen system. The one drawback is the CD changer is noisy and slow, but its worth it for the great sound."
2,This is the workbook,"The Hallelujah Diet book is a better, more in depth book. I got this one by mistake and mailed it back."
2,expectation not met,Not being specific for the reader to take action. The book is not self explanatory. Its not easy to understand
1,May appeal to some,"I read the pre-release proof copy. This book is only for the gullible, and will probably appeal to those in the bible belt. There are a few good diet tips, but you find much better diet advice in other books.There's better books on religion and better diet books."
1,Ugh.,"Food, diet, and exercise will not CURE depression. Anyone who claims they were cured of the disease never had it in the first place. Only medication and years of cognitive therapy will help those suffering from REAL depression, and even then there is no cure. God won't help you, and neither will some special wack diet created for the gullible and Bible-thumpers."
2,Not worth the money,"I was very disappointed after going through this book. I felt it was not only preachy, but very wordy. I also purchased the book ""Recipes for Life"" by his wife, Rhonda Malkmus. If your interested in eating healthier and need suggestions, I recommend purchasing her book. The recipes are great!"
5,Amazing is an understatement,"John Walkenbach has put together one of the most incredible books on Excel formulas. Every office should have a copy of this. At my office we have our people who are constantly fighting over this book.All those formulas you didn't know how to do, this book will show you. If you want to learn about conditionals (if..then) get this book.The examples in the book are great and easy to follow. Make sure though you have a clear understanding of Excel. This is not a book for beginners."
5,Buy this book!!,"I work with Excel morning, noon, and night in both technical and academic environments, and this is the best book that I have ever found on Excel. The writing is clear and concise, and the examples are many and understandable. I learn something new every time I pick up this book, and my bosses think I can work miracles."
1,It's like listening to a tv evangelist,I read this book BEFORE 'The Bible Code'and it made me want to read the original.This is the only book I ever threw in the garbage the second I read the last word. I don't need to be preached to at my age. This guy is just another big mouth preaching about God and the bible. All Stanton knows how to say is 'they left out the vowels'-give me a break. I will be reading The Bible Code soon. It may be another Chariot of the Gods but I bet it won't preach to me. Save your money.
4,Gripping,"Some really great stories in here, and I'm not just saying that cause one of mine is in here. They'd be great with, or without, me. Where was I? Oh yeah, I can definitely recommend buying this.Rock On,Aitch[.....]"
1,BROKEN PC,First let me say that I am sure this refurbished pc from dell would have been fine if it had arrived intact with nothing missing. It did not have the return key cover and I was unaware of this when I purchased it. I contacted the seller (Kool Krowd) and they offered me a refund of $80 total on a purchase that was over $300! I am currently going through the return/refund process with Amazon to get my complete refund but I will never buy anything from this company due to thier poor customer service and decietfulness concerning thier listing.
4,Overall rating : Good,"I am a big fan of MiG series of aircrats. I have closely observed the MiG 27 of the Indian AirForce at Nasik and at an Air show in Mumbai. I wish i had more information on the Mig-23/27 with photographs and 5 view colour drawings / markings.After searching the Net i decided to buy the Book by Yefim Gordon on Mig-23/27.The author has described the aircrafts in detail with rare black and white photos of the MiG-23. The author has also covered the deployment part well. At the end 5 view line drawings ,colour drawings of Mig-23 BN, Mig-23 UM ,Mig-23 ML and Mig-27 M have been included which is useful for an aeromodeller. However 3 views have been restricted to aircraft of Russian Air Force markings. A few more coloured 3 views would have made an aeromodeller happy.Cutaway drawings have not been included. I wish cutaway drawings with details should have been included in the book.Overall the reading is interesting. People crazy about MiGs should buy this book."
3,Mundane but has some merit,"Maybe I'm too old and can't relate to teenagers anymore...but I'm only 31 so I don't think that's it. I do remember what it was like to be a teenager, and even with the many issues I went through, I still can't completely relate to the two main characters (Kenny, Junie) in this book. If anything, it gave me a new perspective.The one thing that I thought was the weirdest was that a man wrote this book. This book reads female all over it. I have a really hard time thinking a 17 or 18-year old male would have the thoughts and feelings that Kenny had. It just doesn't read correctly to me.I did think the book had merit. Not quite sure what merit, but it was well-written, entertaining, funny at times and bittersweet. More bittersweet than anything else. First loves are like that."
4,Hope for a Hopless Romance,"This is a great book for teenagers to relate to the struggles of teen relationships. Although, it seems that Kenny has become hoplessly envovled with someone who doesn't care, your heart will clench to the hope in his voice as he will not let it slip away so easily. This novel portrays a virtue that should be in everyone's hearts...""there are to many mediocure things in life to deal with and love should not be one of them, anything less than extrondinary is a waste of time.""-Dream for an Insomniac"
5,This book is superb!,"I read this book when I was twelve. Only because I thought I was the most mature girl in the world. That was a laugh, but this book changed my view of love forever. I learned to appreciate love and to hold on to it more tightly. This book is absolutely amazing. Canty wrote a piece of pure genious. This book is definitely NOT for a twelve year old, but from anyone 14 and older. Its... there are no words to describe it. Its that good."
2,tman,"This movie was not what I expected to see, so the star rating is justified, I felt it needed moreaction in it. The movie could push the evenlope a litte bit more."
5,Mind Blowing!,This isn't just a script. It IS a movie. The best special effects I've ever seen. I'd give it 23 stars if I could.
5,Simple and Sensible,"I was raised doing Joy School which is a preschool developed by Linda and Richard Eyre, and we absolutely loved it. So now that I am a mother I was excited to read this book. The principles are simple but powerful, and they are easy to apply to your family, no matter what the dynamic is. Our children are still young, so I can't speak to the long term benefits of their ideas. But the family I grew up in uses this same structure and we are a strong, close family of eight children. The Eyres truly know what they are talking about when it comes to creating stronger families."
5,Awesome Ideas For Building a Stronger Family,I took a lot of information from this book and set-up a family economy in our home! My kids love earning their own money and learning how to save.[[ASIN:0684802880 Three Steps to a Strong Family. This book is an asset for any family.
5,interesting,"I thought it was an interesting insight into the world of aviation and not too difficult for a lay person to appreciate. I think one of the authors, Paul Simpkin, is also a comedy writer - and ex-Cambridge graduate. Obviously multi-talented."
1,Poor,Poor sound quality. Too expensive for the lack of quality of the product. Would not buy this brand ever again.
1,For what I paid...,"For what I paid for these headphones, I would NOT recommend them, to ANYONE. The hinges broke after 1 month with normal (seriously, NORMAL) use.I'm usually a big KOSS advocate, but I can't, within the normal real of moral good, recommend these phones."
5,Nice Cans,Very Impressive Cans. Nice and big and firmly made. And really comfortable too. They provide a very pleasurable experience.
3,Disappointed in their fragility,"I hate that I've had to return these headphones to Koss three times in two years because of the right side hinge breaking all the time. These headphones cost too much for that. No warranty in the world is worth shoddy craftsmanship. I'm disappointed in them because I use them for my television watching and they have a wonderful long coiled cord and great sound. I just wish they were tougher. I'm sending them back one last time to get replaced, then I'm putting them up for sale."
5,Listening Pleasure,"Being from the old school and not very receptive to headphones which have no ""meat"" to them, I am pleasantly surprised by the Koss MV1 Pro set. Very comfortable, not heavy, excellent highs and lows, and they come with a ""real"" 1/4"" stereo jack which doesn't break up the sound when you put tension on the cord. Good choice even for the professional listener."
4,review,hmm... the title tells most of what's going to happen in the book... this is a suspenseful mystery... mostly recommended for mystery readers who like to solve new cases.... page-turner... must buy...
5,Easy to Follow steps,This manual has easy to follow steps and explanations for programming of Catalyst switches. It covers commands for both CatOS and IOS.
4,no ordinary time,"if you have read any of goodwins other books, and are a history buff, you will find this one quite interesting"
4,Great story,My wife and I really enjoyed this CD. We heard Doris Kearns Goodwin speak at the Paramount theater in Oakland. Wonderful writer and speaker. One minor nit-picking complaint - the speaker mentioned FDR was able to keep several balls afloat. I suspect he meant to say he was able to keep several balls aloft.
1,Roosevelt propaganda,"FDR was the second worst president in U.S. history after Bill Clinton. He bankrupted the U.S. economy, he made us a socialist nation, and brainwashed us with filthy Soviet propaganda during World War II. Doris Kearns Goodwin is a Roosevelt worshipper. Steer clear of works like this and instead read John Flynn's ""The Roosevelt Myth""."
4,No Ordinary Time,"This book was recommended to me. We were traveling to the Hudson River Valley and were going to stop at Hyde Park. Began the book before we reached FDR's house and am still reading it two weeks later. Yes, it's long, but so well written and so full of fascinating information about two exceptional people. Today's politics is disgusting and irreverent and it's helped me to learn that things haven't changed that much since FDR's days. I have come to admire Eleanor greatly through this read and feel I now have a true picture of their relationship and their contributions to history during what was ""No Ordinary Time""."
5,No Ordinary Time,A fantastic read and so very informative! It gives one such an insight as to Franklin's and Eleanor's Important lives during World II and FDR's last term in office.
4,suprisingly good!,"First off, let me say that this book was required reading for my AP US History class. I didn't expect much out of it, but it was really good. The story was told unlike any other history book that I have ever read. I shy away from giving it 5 stars because it is a history book and it is not critical enough. Goodwin presented the story without enough criticisms. She should realize that FDR wasn't perfect. But otherwise, a great book!"
3,Lots of Facts but not an Enjoyable Read,"I really wanted to like this book and had looked forward to reading it for a long time. However, the writing style compared to other historical novels that I do like was very dry. I didn't get any sense of empathy for either FDR or Eleanor. On the other hand, characters such as Churchill came across much more vividly and likeable. I don't know if this is a reflection of the differences in the peoples' personalities or simply the fact that the author chooses to include every single detail of the daily lives of the couple without ever really let the reader get to know them. For me it has been a book that I'm only able to get through about 10 pages at a time before I get bored. For reference, the last three books I've read, all of which I thoroughly enjoyed were, the Nine by Toobin, The River of Doubt by Millard and Peter the Great by Massie."
3,"good, but gossipy","I found this book to be historically satisfactory, but I thought it lingered excessively on FDR and ER's respective extramarital relatioships. It speculated on what exactly the nature of the relationships were, and then tried to justify its speculation by arguing hos these relationships may or may not have affected the couple's historical meaning."
4,Interesting View on FDR,Greatly enjoyed the unique viewpoint that this book offers on FDR and all the information about Eleanor. Only complaints are I wished it discussed more about FDR decisions in the war and sometimes the book got bogged down by too many details of Eleanor's travels.
2,avoid the e-book,"Terrific book--but the Kindle version is full on typographical errors-including misspelled names, letters for dates, symbols in place of letters, and spaces placed in the middle of words. A few errors could be tolerated, but an average of one mistake per page distracts the reader signicantly."
4,Not for those of limited intellectual curiosity,"Is there anything worse than an intellectual snob? Yes, a psuedo-intellectual snob like brothersjudd with a political agenda. Goodwin's straightforward, rather old-fashioned, biography/history is ctiticized as being for those of ""limited intellectual curiosity"" because she does not challenge the Roosevelt's living arrangements, or point out some other shortcomings on FDR's part. brothersjudd, coming from a conservative point of view, refuses to acknowledge the exceptional nature of FDR and his achievments (can't give those liberals credit for anything), and therefors finds fault in Goodwin's book because she is not harsh enough on the Roosevelts. But the proof of FDR's greatness is not so much in the affection he engendered in the liberal community, but the respect he earned from conservatives like Churchill and American military leaders. Is there room for criticism, of course, but it should be honest, and not transperantly political."
2,Buyer beware,The book did not look new. Looked as if it was sitting on the shelf for years. I was not happy with the appearance of the book.
5,The Roosevelts revealed...,"This book has the perfect opening paragraph. It is one of the most heart-breaking and amazingly telling stories about FDR. The entire edition is chockablock with charm and wisdom and filled with so many behind-the-scenes tales, you almost feel like you were there!If you are looking for a swell gift or a book to loose-yourself-within-the-covers, THIS is the book!"
3,Give me a chance to read it before you ask me to review it,I have received 3 requests to review this. How about giving me a change to read it??????Please please please!
4,No Ordinary Time,"Excellent and detailled picture of Franklin and Eleanor's life on the home front before and during World War II. Most WWII books have focused on the actual battles and locations around the world. This book give us a view of the battles that were fought stateside, including racial tensions, liberal vs. conservative, isolationist vs. hawks. One can see how the same battles raging today in our country were shaped and influenced by the period. It also offers great insights into the personalities and characters of both the President and First Lady.The only drawback was the condition of the book that I received. It was billed as ""like new"" but clearly had been well-used before it got to me."
5,This book is a winner,What a wealth of information and it is provided in an easily read manner that I have greatly enjoyed. Franklin and Eleanor are tremendously diverse and greatly respected American hero's.Thank goodness that our great country had their combination of efforts to guide us through the Great Depression and World War Two. Doris Kearns Goodwin deserves and achieves great reconition for this wonderful book.I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.
3,No Ordinary Time,"The book arrrived in good condition. I purchased it at a very low price, and the seller was upfront about the condition of the book. I am happy with the purchase."
4,UMMM,"As a student who has been forced to read this book for school, I must say it's not as bad as I expected it to be. Sure, it takes me a whopping twenty minutes to read ten freakin pages (and this isn't the ONLY book I have for summer reading), but it's actually a lot more interesting than just reading my history textbook (yeah I have to read a chapter of that TOO this summer!) because it tells history as a story that is much eastier to relate to. In conclusion, summer reading sucks and teachers want us to have no life!"
5,Nice Automatic Torque Wrench,"If you need a larger size (3/4 drive) Automatic Torque Wrench, this is a good value. I'm pleased with mine."
4,Excellent Cross-Over Performance,Eckert is an absolutely amazing performer. His music combines contemporary pop music arrangements with an operatic vocal style. Of his CDs this is probably his best.
4,Good for the price,"It is nothing fancy, a 'made in China' cheap coat rack but it does the job. I did put one in the garage to hook up the bike gear and it has proven sturdy so far. If you like the style, it is exactly as shown on the picture."
3,"Good but not ""heavy duty""","Bought two of these for our mud room, but when they arrived they were too light weight to hold up our cold weather gear. The hooks were too small and too close together. I used them in closets on the inside door and they work well for normal weight items."
3,Loose Hooks,"Item's a little less sturdy than I'd imagined. Upon receipt some of the hooks were v loose, could only be fixed with a specialist tool, which I didn't have, so superglued them. Also, no anchors provided, which is a bit of a pain. Looks ok though, just hope it lasts."
4,Great for the price,"12"" spacing for studs, but I was lucky enough to mount it into a header. Seems to be holding up for the last 4 weeks. We have about 8 spring/winter costs and it is holding up fine."
5,works and looks great,"There was no defects on this product, it has held many of times now more weight than what is recomended. I did drill into 1 studds when hanging this, but some houses may not be able to get any studs when hanging it. I recomend useing a stud finder as this product will hold much less weight if just put on sheetrock."
5,Very nice and speedy service,Pleased with the purchase. The price was right and lower than most stores. Product is as described and holding up well.
1,Dont Buy This China JUNKER !,Brand new out of the box DEAD!!!!!!!! called company rep... waited 36 minutes to talk to real person.....music was killing me.....told me my online receipt was not good enough to cover repair's I needed a cash register or printed store receipt!!!told me on phone I would be resposible for the bill....to repair.. WHY NOT REPLACE IT FLAT OUT ???1 year warranty?????Actron is a BAD company to deal with BAD BAD BAD!!!
2,It's not the wrong scanner,"I ordered a CP9190 and the scanner I received is a 9185. According to Actron this is not the wrong scanner a 9185 becomes a 9190 when it is shipped in a hardcase with many different cables.I bought this scanner to reset the maintence required lite in my 1992 dodge caravan, this scanner will not reset this light so I am very disappointed in the scanner."
4,Excellent Product!,I brought this product twice as gifts for family memebers. This product is very handy and works great.
5,Pleased Purchaser,I bought this product after having taken my 2002 GMC truck to the shop four(4) times repeatedly for the check engine light coming on. I spent $342 trying to fix the problem. After checking my truck with the new scanner I found that all I needed was an $11 gas cap to stop check engine light from coming on. Never again will I be taken advantage of by the service department.
3,"Poor software, poorer user instructions","Software cannot plot recorded data in graph form for sensor performance comparison, this is especially useful in an intermittent situation that does not set a code. You can not save recorded data to a file for future viewing. It automatically detects OBD II vehicle protocol once plugged in and ignition is turned on. It uses USB connectivity that's a plus. Scanners like this are probably not the best all around tool when it comes to diagnosing intermittent problems that do not set a malfunction code, that's where graphing ability of recorded data would be advantageous to this unit if the software were capable. The user instructions are down right pitiful. Just call Actron as soon as you open the case. I didn't have to wait long although they did transfer me twice. I'm hoping it does well otherwise."
1,worthless- just wet a paper towel instead,This product does nothing more than stir up the allergens and make the cat give himself another bath. Save your money- just wet a paper towel and rub your feline down with it- it will have the same effect.
5,Can't live without this product - glad to find it on Amazon,"I have been using these for years, but they are hard to find sometimes. I can't live without them. I even take them with me when I travel. All of my friends and family are now converts as well. I have allergies and have to be very careful around my eyes. These are so soft and non-abrasive. If you haven't tried them, treat yourself!"
2,Pat Martino is what earned a star at all.,"I have never reviewed an album here until I saw that people actually gave this album 5 stars. I have rarely heard worse bass playing and the drumming was pretty bad, too. The only reason I was at this page was to see who the horrible players were. Luckily for them, their names weren't available. If it were me on the recording, I wouldn't want to broadcast it either.By the way, I've seen Pat Martino live with Joey DeFrancesco and was amazed at that show. Martino has also been back with numerous disappointing performances with lacking players. Pat, bring players with you that are on your level!"
4,They're ready to go now!,"This is a collection of covers of Ramones songs, mostly done by European punk bands. They are well done, for the most part. No real stinkers here. Most of the performers stick fairly close to the Ramones original arrangements, but a few artists take the songs in new directions. The most radical rearrangements are the songs by Wayne Kramer and Jesse Malin. If you like hearing cover versions of Ramones songs, you will probably enjoy this CD."
4,Excellent tribute!,"Once again several bands get together for a Ramones tribute album, and once again it is great. I don't think any other band has had more tribute albums done for them that the Ramones. That is part of what makes thier music to wonderful. Any band, playing any type of music can take a Ramones song and make it their own. The one stand out on this c.d. for me would have to be the Dictators, ""I Just Wanna Have Something to Do"", which is one of my personal favs, plus I know the boys from the Dictators and Ramones were very close at one time, living and playing together for years. There are other tribute c.d.'s out there, and most of them are really good, but this one stands right up there with them best. You will not be disapointed."
3,Read it some time ago and am amazed to find it again.,"If I recall correctly, I believe I fell in love with this version of the story in my middle school music class. I am soo excited to find it again to share with my younger relatives. This book inspired my love of opera."
2,Not too impressed...,"WARNING WARNING...do not expect too much from this book if you are a fan of Elton John's Broadway musical and not the actual opera. I found this book in the library shortly after seeing the traveling version of the new ""Aida"" (it was AWESOME) and, while the book does have gorgeous pictures and the story is told from the point of view of someone who practically lives in Aida's shoes, I was disappointed with the overall story. It was completely unlike the show I saw. I realize that the opera and the Broadway show are totally different. However, I found this book to be confusing and was unimpressed by the sloppy style of the writing...loved the musical, though!!"
1,Ripoff City!,"Do not buy this set, unless your willing to settle for what Cheezy Distribution sends you!Several of the movies listed in the set, aren't even in there.So if you're ordering this set for a specific movie, forget it. Chances are it wont be in there!"
5,Great External Hard Drive,I work in broadcast video and we use G-Raid drives for everything we do and everything we backup. So when I needed a drive for at home there was no question in my mind that I was going to buy from G-Technology.This is a hard working beast and is so small and compact that it looks great sitting on top of my G5.
2,delay in receipt,"So far, as of April 17 I have not received this shipment, although the shipper indicated it might take as long as April 24. The order was placed on March 14."
4,Good product,"It is a good product. And it is something that everybody needs, not only for letters but also to mark things."
3,"Disappointing, but only for Dolphy","I have to admit this album was a bit of a letdown for me. After thinking about it for a bit, I really have to blame the material. Both of the major focal songs of the album basically switch back and forth between two vamps ad nauseam, making it stale. Despite this, all of the musicians play extremely well, with Dolphy tearing off some forceful and inspired solos. It just seems to get boring after a while. Musicians like this need to be engaged with interesting and organic material (a perfect example of this is Out to Lunch.) You just know Dolphy can do better than repetitive jam sessions."
4,"Great Knife, BUT...","I had this knife for over 2 years--loved it! Used it for fruits vegetables all the time. And a lot of other things too, BUT my handle broke. I am not a chef, I am not a ""cook every night"" person either. Was SAD that the handle just completely fell apart one day. No repair possible. Sadly missing this knife in my kitchen. And now seems I can't find a replacement. (And I only want the pink one.) Highly recommended, except the lasting quality."
2,"Sharp, feels great, but rusts very quickly","At first, I absolutely loved this knife. It feels perfect in my hand, and is very easy to manipulate. Whereas my other knives haven't rusted in 5 years, though, this has rusted significantly in 5 months.I would love this knife if I didn't have to wash and meticulously dry it _immediately_ after every single use."
2,A disappointment,"I tried. I really, really tried, but I simply could NOT get into this book.I usually give a novel one chapter to draw me in, but because of all the good reviews this book received, I read five. It was no good. I was bored. I just didn't care about the characters or the plot.I love thrillers, but this one left me cold. It's not that Seymour is a bad writer, he just isn't a very good one. There was nothing wrong with his writing, aside from leaving the reader bored and wondering when the action would start.There are too many good books out there to waste your time on a boring one. This is strictly my opinion. Several other reviewers loved this book, so to each his own.This was my first Gerald Seymour book and will probably be my last."
5,Sharpe's Siege,"It is the winter of 1813. Wellington is gathering the forces preparing for the final push into France. Napoleon has dispatched his best agent, Major Ducos (Feodor Atkine), to find out where the invasion will begin.Newlywed Richard Sharpe (Sean Bean) must leave his wife (Abigail Crutenden) to go on a mission in the Pyrenees, capturing a French castle while Wellington forces a passage through Napoleon's flank.A deadly fever has swept through the British camp and Sharpe's wife is infected and close to death."
5,Sun God by Rodney Orpheus,"Passionate, rousing music. Deep, resonant, incredible vocals. Absolutely invoking. Fell in Love with Legba and Guede. I lost my copy of this album and would give anything to find another. Let me know if you have one!"
3,Pleasant,"This is a pleasant album, sometimes even haunting at times, but I would not call it essential. Standout tracks are Sandy Denny's ""Who Knows Where The Time Goes?"" (although I must say I prefer Fairport Convention's version), and Leonard Cohen's strange but beautiful ""Suzanne"" (what the heck do the lyrics mean, anyway?). Joni Mitchell's ""Both Sides Now"" is also a well-known song.Other than those, I am not much impressed with the other hits, and Collins' voice can sound a bit thin at times, a bit heavy-handed at others. Overall, though, fairly pleasant."
2,"I gave her a try, but I wasn't impressed.","I am a huge fan of both Joni Mitchell and Joan Baez, so I figured I'd love Judy Collins, as their musical styles are related. I bought this CD with great hopes, unfortunately these hopes quickly faded. I could not get past her voice! The songs could have been much better if it weren't for her out of tune voice. I don't quite understand why she is as popular as she is; she doesn't write her own music, and her voice is mediocre at best."
5,Incredible,"Judging by some of the negative comments posted, I think people must learn to sit back and listen. True, Judy Collins has a voice that is very plain at times, but that is part of what makes her music so good. When she sings, she sounds sincere. You can understand all of the wonderful words. It makes Collins seem less like some unreachable celebrity, and more like a human being. That is what makes her songs so touching. I think it is time that we drop our idea of what a voice is supposed to sound like, and instead recognize a truly great artist who doesn't sound like everyone else."
1,"Great album, worthless audio","Buyer beware: this Elektra version of the wonderful Judy Collins ""Colors of the day"" has bad mastering. The tape Elektra used was obviously played back with Dolby-C, while not encoded as such. This disc should have been taken off the market. Try and find the gold disc instead."
5,PRISTINE BEAUTY,"An uplifting listening experience as Collins' crystal voice takes centre stage on this collection f well chosen songs by herself (Since You asked, My Father, Albatross), Joni Mitchell (Both Sides Now), Leonard Cohen (Suzanne), Sandy Denny (Who Knows ...) and others. Farewell To Tarwathie is replete with the sounds of the ocean, and her 1971 novelty a capella hit Amazing Grace rounds it off nicely. My favorites include Someday Soon, Both Sides Now, Suzanne and her sensitive interpretation of Who knows Where The Time Goes. Musical fashions may come and go but nothing beats a pure voice wrapped around poetic lyrics set to a beautiful melody. This is eternal music."
4,Taken back in time,"Living in the old west, adventure, romance, mystery, and faith. An exciting time to live, with different cultures and religions mingling."
2,good,"Zane Gray is wordy in his descriptions until it becomes monotonous. He attempts to expound on the human psych but he is actually only judgmental in his proposed insights, I found this book irritating and mundane."
3,Needed to know the ending,"When I realized it was the sequel to Riders of the Purple Sage, had to read to find out what happened to characters!"
4,rainbow trail,"Again this book is well written, but the author does have this thing on mormons, I don't seem to get his message."
5,Good Book,Zane Grey is the master of western series writing. My Grandmother loved his books. They are good today for readers who love western novels. These books stand the test of time.
5,Adorable!,"Thisis an adorable book and perfect for a 3 year old! It has some ""scary "" pages that are age appropriate for the imagination at that age. Our daughter loves it."
5,Genious!!,It makes a lot of sense what Dr. Perricone explains. Most of us don't even stop and think about the connection between brain and beauty. Buy it..it is worth your money.
5,Excellent reference,"I agree with the previous reviewer that this book is not a tutorial. But it is an outstanding reference that will save you many long, frustrating and tedious hours of pouring through the Oracle documentation looking for the syntax of various Oracle commands. I've been spending the last few months developing a JDBC based application and this is the only book that I carry with me between work and home.If you've ever been kept up late trying to get the syntax right on some complex SELECT or CREATE TABLE command, this is the book for you."
3,Overrated,"I have to disagree with the other reviewers and say that this book is overrated. It's one of those books where it's often hard to find the information and you end up looking elsewhere.To start off with, the index is not the greatest. Try looking up ""ORDER BY"". It's only mentioned in the index as one item in an EXPLAIN PLAN command. In general, I found the examples they use to be only bare bones examples. It would be nice to see some more complex SQL.On the plus side, the book seems fairly free of errors and a lot of information is packed into the pages. There's not a whole lot of writing but you shouldn't be expecting that given that it's an ""essential reference"".This isn't a bad book per se. However, it's been on my desk for nearly a year and I just don't find myself using it much."
4,"Pretty good reference, with some minor issues","likes:pretty complete on sql statements and functionsdislikes:why organize it into ""data definition"" and ""data manipulation"" sections? Why not just put all the statements in one alphabetically organized section?missing section on operator precedence (at least, accding to the index. maybe it's in there somewhere)"
2,"Verbose, tedious","I've listened to about 15 of the audio lectures (~40 minutes each) and decided to stop.Robinson's style is prolix and he the lectures are hard to follow. By comparison, I had a great time following John Searle's ""Philosophy of the mind"" audiobook."
3,Hard to get in Canada,I have a Dallas Cowboy sweatshirt thats 12 years plus old. Its Canadian made. I've been looking for a replacement. Can't find any Cowboy or Texens NFL sweatshirts up here in Canada. I do believe in buying my neighbour's goods as well. Must be made in USA or Canada. You only get what you pay for. I hope I can get something in the same line of quality I'm now wearing without have to go over seas to get a product that may only last me the rest of this season. Can you help me?
4,Came dented,"Obviously packaging is the issue. We've ordered one and sent it back due to a big dent on the side. Got another one, same story. Otherwise loved the look, seems like a well made trash can, and if there was a chance to buy without damage would be happy to have it."
5,Memories of youth!,"Since I was a teenager, I received this master gift from my unforgettable first girlfriend who studied English in Canada during a year (she passed away) and the gratitude has not yet ended.The emblematic and smart linguistic devices reported here were very useful through my years as student whether in the High School as well as at the University.Don't hesitate to acquire it. It will be an odd tool of beating actuality."
4,A must DVD for any Chamberlain fan,"This is a must for anyone who is a Wilt Chamberlain fan or interested in learning about one of the most dominant figures in NBA history. Great quality, highly suggest this to anyone."
4,Someone's college thesis,"I bought this book as homebrewer who is fascinated by ancient beer history. It certainly delivers that, in a very dry college thesis term paper way. In fact, half the book is references telling you where the author found his info. There are NO ancient homebrewing recipes, and it's a humorless but intellectual read.I love beer history enough that I'm glad I bought it, but it's not for everybody. I wish I had paid less for it."
5,Great family saga - bringing history to life.,"I have read and own all 8 books of the Kent Family Chronicles - I have them both in original paperback and on my kindle - I have read the series several times and having it in my kindle is much easier than carrying around my dog-eared, much warn copies."
3,Great bargain but what's the point?,"Its hard to beat the price. Most radios would cost more without a charger! But there is a catch. The radio output is 0.5W. Far less than the 2.0W allowed by GMRS. So this radio is only as good as a FRS radio with 7 extra GMRS channels.But bare in mind that using GMRS radios require a license. If you are buying this for a child and not getting a license. It is like teaching him it is okay to break the law. And if you know what you are doing, why bother breaking the law for a half-baked GMRS radio?"
2,"Buyer Beware, Misleading Description, No Toad Here","The product description says 'Frog and Toad Together Frog Plush Toy, 9.5.' A more accurate description would be '9.5-Inch Frog Plush Toy From The Books By Arnold Lobel.' I reasonably thought I was getting 'Frog' AND 'Toad.' But I got just 'Frog.' Nobody wants just one. Should be sold as a pair. Product description should be fixed."
1,Retired Airline Employee,Not worth the cost of the book. It's only 24-28 pages long and is merely a recap of John Fuller's book.
3,For kids I guess,"This book-I bought the hardcover-looks like it's for a kid's library. Large type, big pictures taking up a lot of page room, and a guestimate work count of less than 5000 make for a ""lite"" read at best. You can go cover to cover in about ten minutes. Still at this price, the paperback is an okay deal."
4,"lush, exciting characters w/ a larger than life backdrop","i grew up w/ a drive theatre in my town-one of only three in the state. it closed three years ago-just after i finished high school. it was a tremendous loss. for anyone who ever felt the magic of the drive-in, a big outdoor party and a night at the movies all in one- this book will be a nostalgic look back. for anyone who loves reading books w/ characters make you laugh out loud and whose grief can make you cry- you will love this book. also-as someone who often judges books by their covers- i bought the hardcover edition-which had a very '50ish art deco look. do not judge by this cover. you will miss a wonderful chance to meet characters who will crawl into your heart and stay there."
4,"Too Many Issues, None Fully Explored","Although I enjoyed the various characters and plot lines in this book, I found this story lacking in depth and emotional drive. With too many issues and none of them fully explored, the author seemed to forget his basic focus: the link his mother provided between the narrator's father and his future father-in-law. The Romeo/Juliet comparison some reviewers have made fall flat for me simply because I never believed in the supposed love between the two teens; the pairing struck me as more of a convenience than undying passion. Despite these flaws, the ending--both of a family and an era--moved me to tears."
3,Read the original instead...,"You're better off reading just about anything by John Irving, with nods to Heller. The best that can be said is that it's mildly entertaining, with the potential to make Izzy actually interesting emerging and submerging along the way. Imitation may be the highest form of flattery, but in this case it results in a marginal reading experience at best."
4,A wonderful look into the past.,"I thought this book was a wonderful look into past and what things were like four or five decades ago. There was such a diverse cast of characters and the author made them all beliveable. He made the characters seem realistic without being overly done and we followed Abe from boyhood into manhood, his loves and his losses, and the guilt he must live with over mistakes he made. I thought this was a totally endearing book, and it held my attention until the end."
3,A little bit of both,"When I was told to write an critique on the lastest book that I read, I was worried because I found that I couldn't really choose whether or not I liked the book. It has its good parts, like the way Baker gives you real insight into the minds of his characters, and its bad, the way he tends to dictate events. I enjoyed reading the book although it had its dull points there was always something in the next chapter to keep me turning pages."
3,"Quirky, pleasant yet forced.","While the nostalgic setting and tone and colorful characters should easily have drawn me in - on the surface it's my kind of book - I found the text somewhat forced and insincere. A constant complaint was that the writer would underline and telegraph the outcome of the chapter I was just beginning. And the conversation the narrator was having with the reader wore thin after awhile. Still the ending did surprise, shock even, and all of the characters were quirky enough to hold my interest."
2,"""Anti-copy protection""","I love the music on this CD.Sadly, after trying for some time to figure out why it wouldn't play on my computer, I discoverd the sad truth: It's a broken CD. In tiny writing around the outside of the CD: ""This CD incorporates anti copy technology!""Don't buy it if you care to actually play it."
5,Digital rhythms meet Brian Molko head-on!,"The only words that decribe this CD are 'simply beautiful, timeless and energetic in all the right places'. Alpinestars have since disbanded but the music lives on and the band members will be back under new guises. Go ahead and add this to your music collection, you won't regret it!"
3,Alpinestars - White Noise,"The Alpinestars' second album departs a bit from their first; instead of bouncy synth-pop, White Noise injects a bit of iciness and -- believe it or not -- rock into the proceedings. The results are decidedly mixed. While ""Snow Patrol"" and ""Burning Up"" fall on the good side of the spectrum, many of the other songs don't have the sparkle that was ample on B.A.S.I.C.. The rock vocals on ""Carbon Kid"" take time to get used to, but the Bobby Peru mix of that track makes up for it."
5,a fabulous story of the efforts of anunselfish humanbeing!!!,I am just very perturbed that this book is no longer available as my autographed copy was lost in a theft from our home. Please advise me if there is another printing being considered.
4,Interesting Christmas Reference,"I have three different books that are ""encyclopedias of Christmas"" and each of them emphasizes a different thing. This volume is heavy on historical, traditional and ethnic customs and is quite easy to read. If you are looking for more references to ""pop"" Christmas traditions, perhaps you should check out Mr. Crump's ENCYCLOPEDIA OF CHRISTMAS, since he seems to be pushing it in his review. :-)"
3,"See my review of March 10, 2000","I originally posted two separate reviews. Now I have combined them into the review dated March 10, 2000."
4,The Future is Now,"In this little book, two of film's most visible critics, Roger Ebert and the late Gene Siskel, interview three of the most influential film directors of the last 30 years: Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, and George Lucas. (Scorsese is interviewed by both Ebert and Siskel. Spielberg is interviewed by Siskel; Lucas by Ebert.)Much of the focus of this little book is directed toward film preservation, although the title of the book also refers to trends in filmmaking. It is interesting to see the predictions that all three directors made for the future of film when these interviews were conducted in 1990. Along the way, we gain a bit of insight into the passion these three directors (and these two critics) have for films and their future. An interesting look for the casual fan or the serious film lover.116 pages"
4,Great price!,Bought a bunch of these to make up guitar and speaker cables. I play out 1/2 doz times a month. THese connectors get the job done even during constant use!
2,Not for the advanced physics reader,"Probably a fair book for somebody's first book on String Theory, but definitely not for the advanced reader who is looking for new news. The author covers a lot of areas of quantum physics, but not in any real depth or background. In his first section on string theory he barley talks about strings. He introduces the concept well, and discusses the mathematical challenges of the string theory revolutions in more-or-less, introductory terms. Makes use of diagrams, but seemingly to take up space, rather than visual aids.I read the entire book in about three hours."
4,Much better than expected.,"This book is very well written and it gets right down to the point. It is, also, very clear in concept with only a few points here and there that might have needed a better explanation. This is only an introductory edition, and if more in-depth knowledge is needed I recommend: The Elegant Universe by Brian Greene. Overall: VERY GOOD."
4,good service,"Everything was fine with the shipping and receiving, however I was a little surprised at how many markings are in the book and even words and sections crossed out. The review said some markings. Other than that I'm happy with my book!"
3,Ugh,"I found this book to be an incredible bore. After the first two books in the series, the first one quite entertaining and the second one less so, I was shocked at the incredible number of yawns I counted while reading this. The characters, especially Cait, were so thoroughly unlikeable and I could not relate to them hard as I tried. If it was any other author, I would give this a two, but as I generally like Lawhead books, I hope that this will encourage him to SPEED UP THE PLOT and BETTER CHARACTERIZE!"
4,Great,"I liked this series so much, I have tried to get my hands on every book Stephen Lawhead has written."
4,fun and sweet story,"Pickle and Penguin is the timeless tale of two lonely individuals who happen to meet and become inseparable friends. Odd thing about this tale is that it is a dill pickle and an Antarctic penguin who forge the friendship. If this wasn't enough of a lesson in tolerating diversity, the Pickle is a wealthy talk-show host on TV and the Penguin is just some bored bird who wants a change from all his 'fish and ice'. Making more than a cameo appearance is the Statue of Liberty, who, Pickle says ""shines her torch for those lost from all over the world."" Through the predictable plot (Penguin gets lost and ends up again at the Statue of Liberty where Pickle finds him, after broadcasting his Missing Penguin on the air) we see that friendship prevails. It's a sweet story with a happy and quirky ending that would be a great read-aloud to grades PK-1 or an engaging read-alone to emerging readers."
1,Not the Penguin.,What is it with Kindle books? This is simply not the Penguin Classics edition. I expect the Penguin version to be the Penguin version. I'm funny like that.
1,Illustrated??,"When the creator of this version says ""Illustrated"", what he/she means is that they've added a badly hand drawn image of a quill, and a photo of a capybara..... Don't waste your money!!"
4,Not an Unabridged Edition,"This three CD set (ISBN: 962634377X, Naxos 2006) is not unabridged. It appears, in fact to be a re-issue of the 1998 Naxos three CD set (ISBN: 9626341599). It is, however very well done, beautifully read by John Moffat."
2,Get a text with complete modernization of spelling,I am new to literature of this period and would be enjoying the text much more if modern spellings had been used. I find it frustrating not being able to look up unknown words in a dictionary.
5,great movie,"great vendor ontime delivery. Everything was as advertised. Package arrived in excellent condition. I enjoyed this movie when it was first released, and I'm happy to have it in my collection"
4,Good storyline about a Naval Reservist,"Good storyline! The circumstances were very realistic although the acting was a bit stilted at times. Ending was plausible, but they way they portrayed it was a bit hokey. Well worth the watch."
4,No Propaganda Cliches Here,"The Bridges at Toko-Ri is a simple, yet powerfully told story of Navy pilot William Holden, really a lawyer and father of two daughters, questioning his role and purpose during the Korean War. Having narrowly escaped two brushes with danger, he finds himself being sent on a mission he fears may be his last. Holden is quietly excellent in this role, thoughtfully playing the real man behind the hero. I was somewhat surprised by the film's questioning of the war, having assumed that a film made during the Korean War would feature the usual flag waving cliches. I enjoyed the film's honesty, the realistic depiction of the attitudes of its characters, and I especially enjoyed the flight sequences, well filmed and exciting. It's a terrific, mature depiction of war."
