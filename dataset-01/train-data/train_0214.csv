1,MP3 Download Disabled!?,"For some reason the MP3 download feature is disabled for this album. Not sure if it's Amazon's folly, or a request by the artist. What doesn't make sense is you can download his newest album from the same MP3 Store."
5,The next best thing to sex,"For those of you who have danced your nights away in a damp, dusty warehouse, this album needs no promotion. Amazon does not offer preview clips, but you can check out www.bennybenassi.com. Leave your speakers turned UP!!!"
2,Talk about repetitive.,"You know when you hear about how an album all sounds the same, and it usually really doesn't - or if when it does, it's in a good way because you love that sound? Well, this is not one of those albums. What compelled to get this album because of the club hit 'Satisfaction', which is an addictive song to say the least, thanks to it's heavy bass beats. This whole album, however, is not so addicting. The whole thing sounds like Satisfaction regurgitated. The only other songs I really favored was 'I Love My Sex', and 'Don't Touch Too Much' - but even so, buying the whole album just didn't seem worth it. You might want to stick with the singles for this one."
1,Hypnoti-Caca,"Like a lot of folks, I bought this CD based on the strength of 'Satisfaction' after hearing it on that Wendy's commercial. I can listen to that ditty over and over again... Problem is, when I start up track 2, it's the same song. We repeat that pattern for the next dozen tracks. Don't get me wrong - I like a lot of similiar artists (The Prodigy, Chemical Bros), but I was expecting a collection of songs and not just a remix of the same thing for an hour. Just down load track 1 from iTunes."
3,Good but not great,"Y'know i had only ever heard two tracks from benny benassi which were Satisfaction and Love will Save Us or whatever it's called and just hearing those two tracks i was expecting this cd to bemindblowing, but sadly it was far from it...i was actually REALLY disappointed with the fact that every track sounds like same...i don't understand why a DJ that OBVIOUSLY has the talent to make killer tracks falls short on a cd that had such potential. yeah i guess i just wasn't impressed...if you want a rockin good time, get Right of Way by Ferry Corsten...now THAT cd freakin rocks!"
3,"Shoes okay, but company selling them is not","The shoes looked great, but they ran small so I wanted to return them for a refund. I was told I would have to pay to ship the shoes priority mail, which would have cost me about $15, and then they would charge me a 20% restocking fee. That's almost as much as the shoes cost! I was not happy with the seller. They also sent the shoes in a very damaged box even though these were suppose to be new. Buy the shoes from a different company."
2,So Uncomfortable!!,"Well, the first thing that sucked about these shoes were that they came in and felt way too small. I am a size 9, and I honestly could not believe what I got was a size 9. My toes felt so cramped. I couldn't wear these shoes all night, they were far too uncomfortable. Also, the way they wrapped them made the part that goes up your leg look weird and warped. They did look good, I'll give them that, but the pain wasn't worth it. The arch on them is so extreme and the material so slippery, that your feet push forward, causing your toes to spill out the front. I think that's what made them feel they were too small. They just aren't made well at all. They're made to look good, and comfort wasn't taken into account here. So, if you can deal with a lot of pain, get em. If you're like me and you'd rather be able to wear them all night without crying, then get a pair of flat roman sandals if this is for a greek or roman costume. Believe me, they feel so much better!!"
3,purchaser,"the shoe is very attractive,but the heel was to high for meso i can't wear them long.As long as you're sitting,you'rethe bomb."
4,Great Fun.,"This little thing is neat. My Kids and I built it in about 30 minutes. Would have like a little better instructions as I am not an electronics person, mostly needed more details on direction of the parts, or if that does not matter. I have had to re do the battery connector a few time mostly due to the kids letting the battery hang while they walked around with it."
4,Best fighters on MMA in one arena,"I have seen many fights of UFC and previous PRIDE events and I think this one is one of the best cause in this tape you will see a lot of everything grappling, pounching and kicking and all by the best Vitor Belfort, Guy Mezger ,Ricco Rodriguez Gilbert Yvel, Gary Goodridge ,Mark Kerr, Borisov Igor Igor Vovchanchyn Enson Inoue ,Fujita,Ken Shamrock , Ryan Gracie Kazushi Sakuraba, Renzo Gracie. No UFC new comersThis is a video you should have if you like NHB."
4,Divine Nepotism - Naked Truths Revealed,"In 'Divine Nepotism', Ms. Lewis has given us her truths, baring her soul and emotions. Having done so in such an honest, down-to-earth voice, Tracey Michae'l moved me with her words. Her poetry challenges us to dig deep, to go beyond the surface of what we think we know and/or feel. ""These Things Called Poems"", ""Love Letter (Part II)"", ""Untitled"", and ""Loaded Kiss"" are among the poems that have me awaiting more from this talented writer. Well done Sis. Beautiful things are possible when we stop fighting the voices within us."
3,It was ok.,"The author is clearly committed, and has put much, much effort into this book. I admire that, and I do see most of his points. It's a great book, but just not for most settings. It is HUGELY detailed, and the details overwhelm the points. Most of the time, I would wish for the opposite...more details! Not sure what else to say about this book....it's a great effort on his part, just not very useful for me."
1,Don't buy,"A gorgeous watch but very low quality. I got this watch as a gift, only wore it to the office, and always took good care of it. Perpetual calendar took a couple of months (!) and multiple visits to the store to settle down. It then broke twice over less than two years, each time costing $350 and taking a few months (yes months) to repair. I eventually gave up. Omega service, at least in New York, is despicable. Keep away. My other watch, a $45 Casio, never gave me any trouble even though I race triathlons with it."
5,The Rascals Masterpiece,"This is by far the most creative and diverse musical endeavor The Rascals ever produced. It was a natural development for these gifted musicians who no longer wanted to be type-cast in that- ""let's churn out hits for the teeny-bopper set A&R mentality"", but rather explore their inventiveness and not worry about the shallow listeners. ""Singin' The Blues Too Long"" is what I believe to be the crowning achievement of this album. Although the Rascals never approached the fame and musical level of The Beatles, I can say with confidence that The Beatles would never have pulled off the smooth, elegant and soulful flavor that ""Singin the Blues.."" conveys."
3,The title tells you the plotline.,"If you read and liked Dillard's earlier ""dark"" Star Trek novels, then this one will be right up your alley."
5,A Three Star Novel Turned Into Five Stars By The Final Line,"Possession is the ST:TNG sequel to the chilling original novel ""Demons"". That pretty much says it all. The evil force responsible for the death and destruction in the first novel is back. But hardly with a vengeance. In fact, in Possession they seem far more restrained and controlled than in Demons. Plus, the Next Generation crew doesn't seem nearly as well suited to form a good story with them here. Finally, the more mundane explanation given for the creation of the artifacts undermines them considerably.That all adds up to this being a three star novel.At best.But, the last line of the novel is so absolutely ominous, chilling, foreboding, and ultra terrifying that it serves to elevate the novel by fully two stars. When you've forgotten everything else about the novel Possession, the final six words will stick with you and send chills down your spine that do not dissipate easily."
5,Humorous tale of old time major league baseball,This is actually a review of the Libravox audio book. I don't think anybody could possibly do a better job of reading this neat little book than Rick Rodstrom. His varied voices and Ring Larder's droll book are both thoroughly delightful.
3,"A fun, easy read","The book profiles a talented fictitious baseball pitcher whose primary limitations are his shallowness, arrogance and bone-headedness. Certainly the character is a composite of all the knuckleheads Lardner must have encountered in his beat as one of the premier sportswriters of his era. Elements of the main character can be seen in many of today's sports stars. The book is an easy and amusing read."
4,"Baseball, Mom and Apple Pie",This book was a real hoot to read. Ive always loved the language that revolved around the game of baseball. Ring Lardner does a credible job of creating this youthful prospect trying to make big in The Show. The format of writing letters gives it a touch a realism. The language and grammar of this semiliterates lend it a charm that is slightly reminiscent of Huck Finn. His delusional arrogance is more humorous than offensive in the long run. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the literature and journalism that surrounds this great American game.
2,poor quality printing,"This is a print out of the Internet Archive scanned version of the book from a copy held by the University of California Library. For some reason it is in large print, with large margins and they didn't even bother to orient the page numbers properly, all they would have had to do is select ""left bind"" in the advance tabs in the printer options. If you just want the text you can get it for free on Google books."
5,Good Undergrad Textbook,"I am now for the second time using this as a freshman-level textbook in a course introducing Christianity to undergraduate students. Stott is the quintessential Christian gentleman, and very articulate. It is a testament to his greatness that he can, with all his accumulated wisdom, still write such an eloquent and accessible text.Dennis DurstKentucky Christian University"
1,Not as advertised,"The product is advertised as leather grain pigskin gloves. I received leather gloves. I have purchased the pigskin gloves in a store before, and they are much nicer. It was not worth the hassle of trying to return what they sent me, but I would not use this seller again."
2,"Look good, but don't last","Upon trying on these gloves for the first time I was impressed with their quality and was confident that they wouldn't come undone at the seam along the index finger (since there was no such seam on the gloves). The gloves seemed sturdy enough, but after only a few days of hard work the leather in the area of my thumb and index finger tips was worn through, making the gloves ineffective for their intended purpose.Overall, I am disappointed with these gloves and would never purchase them in the future. My leasson learned is that ""real leather"" doesn't necessarily mean real durable. I will only be purchasing gloves with reinforced fingers tips going forward."
4,Great work gloves,The leather is firm and the glove is warm particularly in this cold spell in January 2013. This is the third pair I've purchased.
3,Nice Feel,"Have yet to use these, but they feel good on and area very flexible. I thought the sizing was a bit small. My hands are small and the medium fit them OK. I wanted these as a gift for someone with bigger hands so I'm ordering a large for them, but I like these enough to keep the size medium for myself."
3,okay for the price,"It came in a different color from the picture. It is oversized for my king size bed and indeed rougher than I thought. But for less than 15 bucks, I can't complain."
1,Awful Sheets,"I purchased two sets of these sheets because of the low price. WASTE OF MONEY! Where our bodies touch the sheets, it turned a pinkish color. My 3 yr old daughter sometimes sleeps with us. When she slept on these sheets, she woke all night coughing. I am guessing these sheets are treated with some kind of chemical which caused the color change and cough. (Some are treated with chemicals to prevent wrinkling.) We replaced these sheets with more expensive 100% Egyptian cotton sheets. The very first night, I didn't hear a peep out of my daughter. These sheets are now being donated to the local homeless shelter."
1,Sleeping on poliester at any price is not good.,"They may look pretty but, I would not sleep on these at any price. They truly feel like poliester. I know they are part cottton & poliester but, it is not the cotton they we felt."
1,These are the sheets for you if you sleep on sandpaper!,"I have washed mine a few times and they are very rough. They are a poly/cotton blend, but I mostly feel the poly! They are a waste of my $$$. I will try a different brand and maybe pay a bit more for a good night's rest!"
4,Good Bargin,"After reading several mixed reviews, i decided to take a chance on the sheets, i love the duvet cover, it washes well because of the dogs. I think the sheets are just fine, I haven't ever spent alot of money on them."
2,Feels like 100% !!,I have these sheets - queen-sized. They are 40% polyester but truly feel like 100%!
1,Don't waste your money on these sheets,"Just as some one said, these are pure plastic, not at all soft and not worth even 19.99 with free shipping. Even after couple of washes they apprear to very harsh."
4,Divatex King sheet set!,"The sheets are extra large and will fit a Californis size, plus they are a nice weight. Well worth the price."
1,Does not fit 2 + 2 trim,"I ordered this and received it after removing the old exhaust on my 1990 300ZX 2+2. Didn't fit. Checked the Borla web site and they state that they do not make a cat-back exhaust for the 2+2 trim. Returned to Amazon for refund. Don't get me wrong, its a nice looking product just doesn't fit 2+2 trim."
5,VERY soft!,"i love how light and soft this blanket is. with other heavier blankets, my son would wake up when i put a blanket over him, but not this one. very soft, warm, and light enough to not wake him. the blue jean teddy pattern is what we decorated his nursery in, so this blanket fits right in."
4,Snuggly!!!,"We recently bought this blanket as part of our nursery set, and it's a wonderfully warm blanket! It so far hasn't peeled or shed, and it's very soft! I highly recommend it...especially for the cold winter and early spring days! My only complaint about it is the bear pattern isn't very clear on there and if you look at it for any period of time it will make your eyes tear up because the picture is so out of focus. I wish they had taken the time to design the print a little better like on some of our other blankets!"
2,"Vocals good, Music Synthesized","The vocalists that sing on this album are quite good - but since I have the cast album, I bought this album for the karaoke tracks. The karaoke tracks on this album are entirely synthesized -- while they were OK for being synthesized (not sure they're in the show key), I prefer the live musicians I had heard on the Stage Stars karaoke Annie (Also available from Amazon). If you want to see what I mean go to each manufacturer's site and listen to the excerpts they have posted."
2,Annie Karaoke CD--disappointing,"The vocals are nothing like the Broadway version--truly awful. Music is mostly synthesized. Fairly useful if you only need the karaoke version, but don't expect the original!"
5,The best blue eyed soul group,"I had this as an album in the sixties and couldn't forget their version of MORE. What a rendition. These cats were way cool. I bought the cd as I'm doing with all the music I loved from my youth, and it's still great. I recommend this to anyone who loves the Young Rascals, although I can't imagine any fan of the band not owning this already. If you're not familiar with them, this is a great introduction. It's amazing that people could come up with so much great music every time out, and that doesn't happen much these days, but the Rascals were consistent hit makers and never made a bad record. Not in my opinion, anyway,but I love these guys. Hope their music inspires young musicians to excellence in their output. They mined the best of American popular music. And contributed a rich legacy to add to it. Great stuff."
2,Run!!!,"I can't figure out why everyone ranked this CD so high. There is much greater Nordic death-metal out there. This CD sounds flat, uneventful, and poorly composed overall. Much better music exists from this region (i.e.: Gardenian, Soilwork, In Flames, At the Gates, Edge of Sanity, Entombed.....), which is why this represents a negative impact for such a talented sector of the death-metal compass. If you're experimenting with Northern European death music, this CD is an unwise purchase."
2,Not as advertised!,"The frame on this table is sturdy, but the blue top is not synthetic. It is just pressboard with a thin veneer glued on top. It would not do well in outdoor conditions, as is stated in the product description."
2,tt table,table has uneven bounce. I had $200 table from sears which had better bounce that this table.
5,El primer libro como padre!!,Fue una gran ilusion comprar este libro. Definitivamente completo y detallado. Narra etapa por etapa que se debe hacer y es como si el libro diera seguimiento a cada segundo de este momento tan especial para los padres. Excelente redaccion y expresion. Comprenlo!!!
2,This book has no structure.,Milton Newman Bunker analyses celebrities handwritings.You can't learn how to do it yourself this way because graphology analysis needs to be structured and have a plan to scan every aspect of a handwriting.I don't agree with the other reviewers: this is not a good book and I am going to resell it quickly.Hope this help
1,Didn't recieve,"I ordered this book in November of 2009 and it is now February 2010 and I have not received the book, please look into it for me, thank you Ellen"
4,"Excel, one of the most useful spreadsheet products available.",I always enjoy learning how to do data studies and Excel is the best for doing so. People at work are amazed that Excel can do so much and this book can teach you the nifty tricks.
2,A Strong Start with a Very Weak Finish,"Mr. Ingram started the book out quite strongly with a fundamentally different way to look at relationships than has been done through popular culture and the media for the last 70+ years. However, about halfway through the book, Mr. Ingram steps up to the pulpit and is sidetracked by a excessively-long rant on sexual purity and the ""Second Sexual Revolution"". Only a scant few paragraphs are dedicated to addressing that which the author proposed in the front half of the book. In short, Mr. Ingram builds a nice head of steam but vents it off too soon. In fact, it almost seems as if halfway through, the author forgot about the book he started to write and starts writing another one."
4,It's an okay read.,"There are many books on this topic and I've found them all to be pretty much the same. The Christian perspective is key here, though. I think Chip did a fine job explaining how ""to do"" relationships backed by Biblical support. He spoke on this topic on his radio program also. Almost verbatim with the book."
1,Get to the point,I love to read The book probably has great information but I've tried to read it twice. I made it to chaper 3 this time. It drones on and on and on. Get to the point and then move to the next one. Maybe I should start half way through or read one paragraph a page.
5,loved it!!,"such a great book! for anyone, whether single, in a relationship, or not! its a must-read for anyone who desires to succeed in relationships!"
1,Weird,Nothing else to say about this one other than it was really too weird for me. I didn't finish it - and likely won't open it again.
3,Unique work,"I never heard of him before. On sampling his work on Amazon, after he won the prize, I found it good. But his books are not available even in second-hand in Kathmandu.He must be a wise man to have lived all these years in China and write. It is an act of a great courage for an artist. It is easy to take a flight elsewhere and create spurious work for a targeted audience. Sample 'The republic of wine' for a clue."
2,Weird,"I bought this book after the author was awarded the Nobel prize this year for his literary work. The book is definitely different... fantasy cannibalism in communist China appears to be the main focus of the book. The translation is hard to follow, and the Kindle edition contained a number of misspelled or omitted words. Overall, I do not think this book is worth an average person's limited ""reading"" time."
2,Lost in translation?,Maybe it's a better book read in Chinese. Could not get in to it at all so didn't finish it.
1,"Way to graphic and too much on alcohol, disgusting foods.",I probably just chose the wrong book. One of the very few I did not finish. Just could not relate to the subject matter. Maybe I will try a different one in about 10 years!
2,"Difficult, unpleasant reading.","I am having a difficult time finishing this book. I decided to buy it because the author was awarded the Noble Prize.The translation is bad and there are typographical errors, i.e., ""Tm"" for I'm. The subject matter is mostly food, not wine. I became physically ill reading the description of the ""all donkey"" meal, which decribed every part of the donkey being eaten, and I do mean ALL!I understand that some cultures find it exciting to eat every part of every animal on earth, but to me, its disgusting. And if that isn't bad enough, the protagonists is an inspector investigating reports of a group of people who eat little boys."
4,Is worth the time,"I must start by stating that this is my first Mo Yan book read. I liked it a lot, but it has to grow on you ( kind of like Umberto Eco). Not an easy read at times, but worthwhile nevertheless. Strongly recommend it. I do not give it 5 stars because I don't think is up to par with 100 Years of Solitude, or other Nobel writers I have read, but is very good. Remember this is a subjective review."
1,it seemed great at first,"I bought this camera for work. It was terrific for four weeks and then the mode dial stopped working. I returned it to the distributor. Two weeks later, I collected it from the distributor. It worked fine for a week. Then the mode dial stopped working again as did the arrow pad. I am now returning it for a second time."
2,"Great Camera, But....","...you're on your own when it comes to batteries. If you're wealthy and can afford pocketfuls of weird batteries, you'll love this camera. I was going to buy it until I learned it doesn't take 4 AAs. I can get AAs in Calcutta, Urbicande, Samaris and Detroit. Try getting a A78XX324732799-U rechargable! (Actually, they may have one in Samaris, but I wouldn't count on it.)Avoid proprietary batteries as you would avoid, well, proprietary batteries. Ten years from now they'll be special order only and will cost more than the camera does today.Happy Shooting! Whatever you buy."
2,I'm staying away...,"I don't own this camera, so in fact this isn't a review. I'm just getting my voice on the record so Olympus can know my major concerns,and why I WON'T be upgrading from my C-5050 despite the major improvement in camera startup and response time.1. Get rid of the proprietary battery. Reap your profits in repeat busines, not in milking each customer for all their worth.2. Give us the fast 1.8 lens found on the C-5050. This one's a no-brainer.3. Get the build quality right. I've seen too many reviews here and elsewhere warning of multiple returns for defective cameras.4. Make extension lens attachments standard. You don't have to include the lens, fine, but don't make me buy an extra part when you can build it in for practically nothing.'Nuff said!"
1,Decent camera when it works,"For the first year we owned this camera, it worked pretty well. You can read online camera reviews for the specifications.But then it started to malfunction badly. It would lock up, refuse to go into certain modes, display random menu settings on the screen, etc. These problems seems to occur to many 5060 cameras after several months of use.In a word, it is unreliable. You're probably better off looking for a more reliable camera."
3,"Lens Envy, batteries","I had an Olympus C-4040 which I was very happy with. I ""upgraded"" it to the C5060 when they came out. I have to say that the bright f1.8 lens on the 4040 had spoiled me. A lot of low light photos that had been easy with the 4040 were out of the question with the 5060. The lowest f stop on the 5060 is only f2.8. That means that photos I had been taking at 1/60th of a second were now needing 1/20th to 1/30th of a second exposure. If you use a lot of flash maybe it won't matter to you, but I use natural light for most of my stuff. The 5060 was stolen recently and after research I scoured the internet for one of the older C5050 cameras that has the F1.8 lens to replace it.The other issue I had is with the propietary Li-on battery that came with the 5060. A spare costs $70. The 4040 and the 5050 use AA batteries. A better option. I hope someone from Olympus reads this. Lenses matter. I looked at the new C-8080 camera, but the lens on it was a mediocre f2.4."
1,DO NOT BUY OLYMPUS C-5060 DIGITAL CAMERA!,"Olympus has a problem w/ part# VC7997 on these cameras that causes menus to pop up on LCD w/o touching buttons and buttons stop working. Numerous people are complaining about this problem on the Internet - go to yahoo groups, Olympus_405080. Olympus needs to recall camera. Mine worked fine for almost 3 months before problem arose so don't think yours won't fail."
1,Poor quality,A camera as expensive as this one should work for more than a couple of years. I used to love the camera and Olympus but will not buy there products ever again. The menu options have malfunctioned making the camera usless. And after reading the most current reviews the same problem has happened to many other people. Seeing that so many people have had this same problem shows that Olympus makes poor quality equipment even in there more expensive cameras. Look elsewhere.
3,Mode dial problem,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! The internet is full of reports of mode dial problems. This is a design flaw that Olympus apparantly has not addressed for out-of-warranty users. This problem will render your camera useless and it a very expensive repair.
2,Good chance you'll have problems with this camera,"I love the camera and it's features--but both of the ones I've received have failed within about 100 pix over 2-4 days.First one had a bad on/off switch. Camera ON IT""S OWN would start scrolling through menus. And guess what--I didn't even realize there were other features in menus I never even got to see. I wouldn't have figured that out if I didn't get #2.The second camera's on/off switch was fine, so I thought OK, now I've got a keeper. On the third day of taking some pix, suddenly the LCD doesn't work--meaning you can't see any menus either.Olympus has a big problem with this camera. I'll order one more--maybe third time is a charm. But if the third one is a bum, I'll have to wait until Olympus figures out the problems. Hopefully another camera maker will come out with a wide angle lens, which was my main criteria for picking this camera."
4,Not bad...,"Bought this as a christmas gift for my wife. I got to try it out a few times and was never disappointed with the results. Wish I read up on the reviews before I got it, might have got something else instead."
3,Not just for children....,"On the surface, this book appears to be the standard 'orphaned kids with the mean step-uncle run away to grandma's' but it is much more than that. With MacKen's laying this tale subtly over the Irish rebellion of the 1920's, we see England-born Finn also rediscover his Irish heritage. On his journey, we find ourselves realizing along with him that sometimes what is 'right' and what is 'legal' don't always coincide. [Note: sometimes this book is compared to Disney's 'Escape to Witch Mountain'. Please keep in mind that, unlike Disney, and aside from a brother and sister as main characters, the characterizations in this book are deeper, the writing is better, and nobody gets married and sings at the end.]"
2,Too long.,The ribbon wasn't lightweight so you really need to move your hand/arm vigorously to make it stay afloat. The long length also contributes to tangling. It's too difficult for a young child.
4,Simply heartwrenching,"This book takes a look at the destruction of a marriage like no book I have ever read before. I cried right along with Margaret, hating the Other Woman to no end. While at times the language is outmoded, this book is still a very powerful depiction of some very painful subject matter. Get out the Kleenex!"
2,Old hat in more ways than one...,"For some reason, I'm drawn to Belva Plain's books. Probably for the beautiful illustrations on the covers of her books, and also for the plain, simply drawn characters. Unfortunately, I find the language to be outdated and not colloquial enough. You don't hear the verb ""shall"" too often. Also, the characters of all her books are pretty much the same. They have a crisis, they get through it, everyone meets a new mate immediately with whom they fall madly in love. I don't buy it, and believe me, I don't. I'll borrow it from the library first"
1,Out of touch with reality,"I don't understand how the author could think it could be believable that these three ""perfect"" children could be the product of such selfish, self-centered parents. Neither Margaret, nor Adam ever consider their children when they make decisions. Yet supposedly, while they were married, they were wonderful parents. I work with people every day who have gone through greater loss than either of these two parents and still have thought of their children before themselves. It is a fantasy to believe that these parents were ever good parents. In addition, I think it is a lazy author who instead of dealing with emotion simply gets rid of someone. It isn't worth reading because it goes from bad to worse."
1,"Trite, obvious, overdone potboiler","I recently listened to the cassette abridgement, and hadn't listened to much before I was saying to myself ""Wow, this is a bad book."" The story is incredibly obvious (I could have predicted most of it after the first few minutes), the dialogue is completely unbelievable (I didn't for a minute think that people actually talked like that), the structure was clumsy, and people seemed to exist only to make a point (e.g. the niece). I didn't much like any of the characters, or believe in them for that matter. I don't know if it's the fault of the abridgement or if the novel is like that, but I think I'll skip her books from now on."
3,You get what you pay for,"The picture quality that this cable produces is slightly fuzzy which you'll probably notice on first use coming from a higher quality cable. After a while you get used to it, but still... not great if you're picky."
2,Came up short.,"For some reason, the red component of the signal failed to show up on the monitor when I installed this cord; I must have gotten a defective one. It's also too much of a hassle to bother returning this defective product, shipping & handling costs being what they are. Caveat emptor!"
1,This cable doesn't work,"I have a 17 inch LCD monitor hooked up to a laptop. This cable only supports low resolution which makes everything huge on the screen. My old VGA cable supports 1920 x 1080. This new SVGA cable should support at least the same (specs say more) and it doesn't. Highest resolution that worked was 1280 x 960 which defeats the purpose of having a separate monitor hooked up. Might as well use my laptop monitor. This cable wasn't expensive, but it's worthless."
1,Expensive Night-Light,If you run this item on high for 4-5 hours & stick your nose up to the vent you MAY detect a odor of menthol....maybe.
5,I LOVE THIS BOOK!,"This book is full of so many riddles (both easy and challenging) that really make you think. The answers are at the back of the book, so you don't go crazy trying to answer a riddle. The answers are so obvious, it makes you want to laugh for not thinking about it before. Great buy! Great for road trips, plane trips, or just any spare moment!"
4,STILL THE BEST!,"As much as I admire Cary Grant for his presence and easy charm, he lacks the worldliness and dramatic depth of Charles Boyer whom I earlier admired in 'Algiers.' He's more graceful and expressive and his consumate Frenchness makes the contrast between he and Dunne all the more interesting and romantic. As for Irene Dunne, she's so effervescent compared to Kerr. Kerr seemed somewhat brittle for all her sincereity and warmth."
3,BAD DELTA!!!!!,"As evidenced by other reviews, this DVD is watchable but overall is not that great. The picture quality isn't that bad but there is one major splice and 2 instances where the picture sort of rolls. I've seen this happen when recording from VHS."
4,A great movie no matter who's in it,"This story is timeless. I have seen this version as well as An Affair To Remember and enjoyed them both immensely. I must admit that I also love Sleepless In Seattle! After reading some of the other reviews I almost didn't buy this dvd because of the remarks of how bad it looks, but I was pleasantly surprised when I watched it. While the video quality is certainly not up to the standards of remastered movies, it is as good as most vhs movies which makes it very watchable. If you want to see the movie, then buy this dvd. You won't be disappointed. If you must have the utmost in picture quality, then pass this one by. This movie may never be remastered and this may be your only chance to see it. The price is reasonable and you'll see a very good movie...I'm glad I bought it!"
2,Love affair Irene Dunn,"Disappointing original to a much more sensitive portrayal by Deborah Kerr & Cary Grant. A wooden performance by Irene Dunn, who looks haggard in places doesn't help."
1,"Good movie, terrible DVD","Delta Entertainment didn't care much for restoring the movie. The quality of picture is bad, very grainy; sometimes picture frame moves over the whole screen; I have even seen noisy lines specific to VCR. I suspect, Delta just digitized the movie off a VHS tape, not off the master. Upsetting...The movie itself is OK."
4,"Fine film, but...","This is a Hollywood classic, every bit as good as the other [...] reviewers contend. BUT the picture on the DVD made in Canada by Madacy Entertainment Group is decidedly mediocre. It hasn't been technically enhanced, and there are occasional blotches and sound difficulties. Buy it; the price is right. But then wait for a better DVD to come along."
2,"Dunne Gorgeous, Mumbly Peg","so with all the viewing of 2 versions of Love Affair and An Affair to Remember was most dissapointed with the original primarily due to Irene Dunne's vocal projection, she barely moves her mouth, you can hardly understand her dialog and she just poses for the pretty girl pic... Deb worked that role to the max and is no match for this ingenue... Charles Boyer was most handsome but a bit tooo smarmy for my tastes esp for 1939, like OOPS I have too many girlfriends vs Cary really trying to love someone wholeheartedly in his interpretration.... absolutely love this story but the 2nd version is my all time favorite, guess the iteration of a classic improves over time, recommend for those who seek the origins of the other two versions."
3,A Superior Chick Flick,"A fine rendition of the starcrossed lovers genre. Primarily notable for its superiority to its dreadful remake: ""An Affair to Remember"". Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne have excellent chemistry in their roles."
1,Awful version,"Awful! Out of the three versions..... ""An Affair To Remember"" Grant/Kerr is THE ONLY ONE. Dunne is much too gay all the time (the role is best played when Terry is apprehensive and decision torn). Boyer is diminutive (particularly his head) next to her. The most important nuance of the entire film is completely blown when Michel/Boyer speaks in such a way as not to admit that he was waiting for Terry/Dunne (Empire State Building)and her reaction instead of poignant (as Kerr's) was sought of an odd knowing smile when it should have been the look of a question mark... as Michel had not as yet disclosed that he was actually there. Obviously,the director corrected this reaction and Terry/Dunne's annoying never ending gayety in ""Affair to Remember."""
1,Bad Quality DVD!,"I have to agree that these are bad prints. I bought 5 of these Madacy DVDs and will return all of them. I am not usually very picky about quality. A good VHS tape is just wonderful to me. These DO NOT COME CLOSE TO VHS!The sound quality is so bad, I couldn't get through the film. The hiss is not only audible, it drowns out the soundtrack. The picture has weird artifacts that I have never seen before. I could have tolerated them, but the audio hiss gave me a headache. My guess is that the publisher bought a $2.99 VHS tape of these movies and transferred the tape to DVD. No noise reduction whatsoever. Its like listening to a cheap cassette on a $5.00 walkman--I kid you not! You could do just as good a job in your basement with a VHS tape player and a DVD writer. Come on Madacy, you could have at least suppressed that hiss!"
5,AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER,"Another gem from that sterling year of 1939. Noted for the fact that the script was constantly changing almost daily with additions/improvements; the result is a remarkably seamless and engaging love story. A multi-kleenex weepie inspired countless romantic dreams of true love atop the Empire State Building. An excellent example of a subtle blend of comedy/drama, it's witty at first then becomes more subdued with plenty of romance and drama during the second half; yet it never cloys. The song ""Wishing"", (which is heard in the children's ward scene) was nominated for best song of 1939 (""Over the Rainbow"" won) Leo McCarey remade this as ""An Affair to Remember"" which is better known--but it's essentially the more artificial and glossier version--any film buff will tell you that this is a much better movie!"
3,Ambient ambience,"This is definitely Plotkin's most utterly ""ambient"" solo release, on a par with his collaborations with Mark Spybey, Brent Gutzeit, Mick Harris, etc. There are no rhythm tracks, bass lines, or other such frills. The only source instrument listed is the guitar, but as usual, you wouldn't know this by listening to it. It's been completely manipulated and deconstructed into purely abstract sound. The first time I heard the hint of a melody was on track 5. Overall, I dare say it sounds a little cliche. To be fair, according to the liner notes the recordings span from 1993 to 1996, and I don't think it would have sounded so hackneyed during that period. (Well, maybe to Brian Eno it would have.) Like most ambient, it's great when you're in the mood. When you aren't in the mood, listening to it can be a frustrating experience."
5,I loved it!,"What a brilliant, brilliant book. I think it was the perfect length. Any longer and it might have gotten monotonous, and we simply cannot have THAT. Oh, this book was delicious. I ADORE all sorts of modern mythology, and we all know that Gaiman is the undisputed MASTER of that particular genre. Harlequin Valentine is a precious little romance with a vicious little twist at the end. So, sit down with a plate of hash browns and some ketchup, and enjoy!"
5,Written for kids but with an adults sensibilities,"Like Harry Potter, these are books which target children ages 7 and higher, however, the material and subject matter is sophisticated enough to entertain adults. Im one such fan of Ted Naifeh, who's writing and art are at his best in this series about a young girl with gifted powers. Think of Courtney Crumrin as Wednesday from the Addam's Family except with magical powers. Both are curmudgeon's and yet adorable; kids who grow up too fast or who have old souls. Her adventures are typical for a girl of her age except they involve very real monsters and very deadly situations. If you like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Harry Potter you'll love this graphic novel series (yes, they are graphic novels or comics). I am now a fan of Mr. Naifeh and young Ms. Crumrin."
2,"Reivew of Chorinicles of Narnia The Lion, etc.",I liked the game for the few minutes I could play it. i got a bad copy and although I got a refunded I never bought the game again so that soured my experience.
1,CRAPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!,"I don't see what the other reviewers see in this game. The graphics are o.k., but it's crap! I played a level where Peter helps free Edmund from the White Witch, and stabbing the Cyclops' and Minotaurs doesn't hurt them, but picking Edmund up by the neck and swinging him around like a club OBVIOUSLY hurts them! CRAP! And also, the characters mouths don't move when they talk! Either they're very good ventriloquists, or the creators of this game were too lazy! I would only recommend die-hard Narnia fans rent it, and see if it's any good. And trust me, this game isn't scary! ( I mean, (...) but only 7,8,or 9 year olds could be scared by this, this,this, CRAP!)"
2,The High Rating Is For The Format.,"This book, the first edition, is very simple. That is probabley it's best feature. The second is it's drawings. Negative points come from thin content, vague content and limited application value. It describes the use of explosives, fuses and primers... but no formula(s). Its an elementary idea book at the most. If many of the other books presented the information in the professional format this book is in... it would be a miracle manual of sorts. Silencer description...OK. Pipe Grenade... bad. Shot Gun Grenade Launcher... semi valuable. Claymore Mine... not a good idea. Rocket launcher... incomplete and no actual how to instructions. Plastic Explosive... Mix two ingredients, wow. Blasting caps... good for beginers. Thats it. If the other three are like this, I don't think Ill take the time to read them. All 4 minutes."
1,Make-believe Anarchism for revolutionary wannabees,"All the information in this book is either bogus or suitable only for puerile kiddie games for the weird types who like to sit around and play like make-believe revolutionaries. None of the instructions are adequate to make the infernal devices described (blasting caps, pipe bombs, grenade launchers, Claymore mines, rocket launchers) and most require access to conventional explosives (from unspecified sources). There are no discussions about how to prepare actual explosive mixtures (any 19th century handbook or innumerable Websites will give much, much more reliable information), and the one explosives recipe (for ""plastic explosives"") is a joke and would not work (although grinding potassium chlorate crystals into a fine powder as recommended could cause autodetonation and serious injury to the would-be bomb-maker.....).This short (64 pp) book is poorly printed and full of typos. I deeply regret having wasted my (money) on it."
1,U got to be kiddin,"books like this are not a relaible source if you want to make explosives because they would probaly blow up in your face.If you want good books, try Poor man's James bond, princples of improvised explosive device (Switches) and Home workshop explosives (on Amazon) because you can make the stuff, if you wanted to but.Also don't get caught with books because of September 11Do not show them off to your friends or family"
4,Do you really need to know this? YES!,"Everything they don't want you to know. Simple ways to do what you dreamed of in fifth grade, now a reality and just as fun!"
1,Nowhere near the versitile tool it's advertised to be,Very disappointed in this opener. The bottle opener doesn't fit anything I've tried to use it on so far; the pull tab opener doesn't easily slide under the tab without a lot of work. The person I purchased this for has limited hand strength and I thought this would be perfect; it is far from it. You'd do as well using a spoon to open pull tabs rather than purchase this pricey gadget.
1,Fails to open most plastic lid bottles,"This unit looks nice, the pop top works of course but try to open a deer park bottle or other similar and it slips on the plastic top.Bought for someone with arthritis, do not purchase for it will not work even out of the box after a couple times."
1,Junk,Doesn't work or anything. Opening water bottles is a joke! You have to press it down so hard on the bottle top that the water squirts all over the place. The soda can opener part is too thick to get under the pop top. Don't waste your money.
1,not for the weak of hand,Have great difficulty and weakness in my hands. Need too much strength to accomplish the tasks I wanted this for.Very disappointing.
3,Good game could be better,I was all around disappointed with the Wii World WarII games. But out of all of them I think this was the best (don't be a fool and buy medal of honor heroes 2 this is better). If you want a decent WWII game for the Wii buy this one.
4,Wii First Person Shooter Fun,This is the best Wii FPS so far. Much better visual and control wise than Resident Evil. Gameplay is actually rather difficult so it makes you want to try and try again. Must have in any Wii game collection
3,shooting nazi gremans,"This game is a little more fun to play on the Wii than other consoles but it is still an older game that was just remade for the system. I like this series of games and have always found them fun, but I look forward to trying one of their newer titles."
3,Not bad,"This game is the typical wartime fps. The Wii controller is hard to get used to for this game, when your used to playing with ""typical"" controllers."
4,"Fun singleplayer, NO multiplayer","This game is actually a lot better then I thought it would be. However, be warned that there is NO multiplayer whatsoever, off or online. I keep seeing companies advertise it as having multiplayer but it really doens't. It would be nice if the game actually did include it, but the developer said it will not be added in the future. I wish companies would stop saying it includes it when it doesn't, because it's false advertisement and I bought it under false pretense because of such."
2,Unfortunate Sequel,"I would blame this game sucking on the Wii, it is unfortunate that the sequel to COD2 had to be this game. I played it on the X-Box 360 and it wasn't good there either. I was only able to stand playing the game for about an hour. After that I couldn't bring myself to touch it again."
3,Call of Duty 3,"Our son receive this for Christmas. He's played the game several times over the last month. The violence isn't as bad as some games, which is what we were looking for. Clearly it's still a war themed game, but we think this is a good compromise compared to some of the M for mature titles."
4,Really Fun Game,"This game is entertaining and I cannot stop playing it. I have successfully completed all of the levels multiple times and I am still thoroughly enjoying it. There is interesting plot(helps you to get to know the characters)and the levels all have something new and exciting in them. The only issue, the Wii has really bad graphics, so sometimes it doesn't look at all real. but it still is incredibly fun to play. Compared to World at War I feel like they did much better on 3, however, my personal favorite COD game on the Wii is Modern Warfare Reflex. But this one is definitely right there with it.Just to recapPlot:5/5Graphics:2/5Controls:5/5Overall Gameplay:4/5For any of you who are trying to decide on whether or not your going to by this product, I highly recommend it. This game is top notch."
3,no multiplayer,I got this game for christmas. There is no multiplayer at all which stinks because it said online it did. We beat the game in 6 days. Overall this is a good game for the money.
4,"Good Game, could have been better","This game was released with the Wii and I have to give it credit for that. The game was good in terms of action and gameplay. The controls however, were a little sloppy. It was as though the develoopers took an existing game and just threw in Wii controls. The driving was terrible, and the idea of rowing a boat was a bad one. I really enjoyed the way the guns work with the movement of the Wii Remote. If you like a good first person shooter, this would be a good place to start on the Wii."
5,Awesome game!,"This game is awesome! I bought this game at Game Stop. I recommend this to anyone who can't play the newer version of Call of Duty because of the rating. -Stephen, age 9"
1,Did not work,Do not buy from this company (Activision/EZ corp). I purchase this game for my son for Christmas and it did not work. They contacted me with a nice email apologizing and promising to refund my money and sen me a new game. They have done neither.
1,Unplayable - can't get past first hand-to-hand,"I'm amazed anyone else here could write a review at all for this game on the Wii. No one at my house has been able to get past the first hand-to-hand combat with the German soldier. We tried dozens of times, different strategies, different controllers - nada. The game even prompts you with instructions during the melee, but nothing seems to work - fast, slow or otherwise."
4,Great FPS,"Having just upgraded from the XBOX 1 to Wii, I was greatly impressed with this game. I read some reviews that panned the graphics etc and I must say its really a perspective thing. If you're coming from the XBOX 1 you won't be disappointed at all. The controller gun is great. I am using the NERF gun,,, **Gamestop is selling Call of Duty 3 for 19.99.."
3,zdogg,"Call of Duty 3 definitaly isn't what I thought it would be. The controls using the Wiimote are very difficult. Your arm will get very sore from holding your hand up in the air, and if you decide to put your arm down for about 1 second, the camera goes crazy. Call of Duty 3 does feature some cool content though. Somtimes enemy soldiers will hide around a wall or door and wait for you. They'll either attempt to stab you or hit you with the butt of their rifles. Using the Wiimote and Nunchuck to shove them off and hit them with your rifle was a cool idea, but gets annoying through the game. In all Call Of Duty 3 doesnt Dissapoint, or impress."
2,Worst game for Wii,"I bought this game, thinking that it would be fun(regardless of the multiplayer, which, by the way is unacceptable). The truth is, the ""coolness"" factor wears off extremely fast, and then it just collects dust. Out of all the Wii games I've played, this is, by far, the worst."
4,NO Multiplayer,"Overall, this is a great game that is worth the time and money.However, I just wanted to fix a huge mistake Amazon put in the product discription.The Wii version has NO MULTIPLAYER"
2,disappointed,While playing the game there were some problems with remote and game. Didn't always connect making it hard to play.
3,Call of duty 3,The game is ok but you can use a gun with it but you have to take it out to do certain things with it during the game.
3,single user?,"It was my first ""Call of Duty"" video game that I bought. I was really excited to play since I've heard pretty good things about the game but for my surprise, the begining was a little hard to understand it. I took me a lot of time to get into it but when I finally got used, the next surprised arose and I thought it was for 4 players but no! It's a single player video game. It has no fun to play alone or be watched by others not being able to join you in the game. I don't know if this apply to other consoles but it is for the wii version. So, keep this in mind when you decide to get yours."
4,Fun fist person shooter,"I got this game for christmas last year. I didn't finish but had alot of fun. Great game and kills lots of time.For a wii it has good grapics and great gameplay. Its a hard with wii controls at some points but once you get pass those stages your back on a battle field and you and your gun are ready to lock and load. I have played a other call of duty for X box 360 and had more fun, for one reason split screen and online. If you are looking for a game for single player expirience you will have loads of fun. And call of duty fans with wiis may wan't online at least rent for a good campain."
1,I can't give less than one star?,"Little did I know, but it turns out that a number of women I know have read and promoted this book for many years - and now they (most notably my own mother) sit and wonder why their husbands don't respect them or even give them the time of day and, for some, their marriages are falling apart by the seams.This book promotes the dumbing-down of women and their roles in society and family. For centuries women have worked alongside men (granted, getting less credit, but working just the same) and only the privileged few could stand idly by while the 'menfolk' talked 'business'. Even my own grandmother worked a full-time job (from which she just retired at the age of 74!), managed to successfully raise three great children and is still happily married after 50+ years."
5,Like running on a cloud,"I was initially skeptical about spending over $10 for a single pair of socks, but the moment I put them on I became a believer. These are now the only workout socks I use and I am planning on buying a second pair.The material is thick and VERY comfy, but it is also quite breathable and my feet never feel hot or stuffy in them. After running or using the elliptical my old socks would be wrecked and reeking from the sweat. These socks, however, just get a little damp and within a few hours they are totally dry and still odor-free. I also used to have some slippage around my heel, but the socks' rolltop and extra cushioning have eliminated that issue.All in all, I can't recommend these highly enough. You definitely won't regret buying them :)"
3,sad review,"i have been a devoted fan of this sock for many, many years....worth every penny if you value your feet .I hope i am wrong, but it seems that there is less cushion / material in the ball and heel area of this sock.I do hope this is due to the fact that these are 'running' socks and not 'tennis' socks....hopefully the 'tennis' have morecushion , esp. in the ball of the foot area.we'll see."
2,Not for a Man's Size Foot,I have worn Thorlo Running Rolltop Socks for at least 20 years with no problem. I am extremely disappointed in this last purchase in that the elastic at the top is very tight. The opening itself is small and evidently made for a little girl's foot.
5,Don't Ignore The Roar!,"Kurt Schiller's Roarshock is a turbo-powered journey through the vast unexplored regions of the capability of the human mind. Scientists say we only use about 10% of our brains, and once you read Roarshock you'll probably agree that's a good thing!Using well-deliniated and believable characters, author Schiller masterfully guides the reader through a high tension wire plotabout a dedicated coterie of medical professionals banding together to stop a seemingly unstopable force. It's a wonderful first novel and a grand read for horror/sci-fi enthusiasts. I look forward to hearing Schiller's roar once more."
4,A ripping good read!!,"It's always a pleasure to discover a first-time author, and this book doesn't disappoint. The narrative deftly combines occasional splatter-like gore scenes with plenty of insights regarding psychiatric and military mindsets. The supernatural menace is highly original, if not unprecedented. The author's attention to his characters maintains the reader's interest; this is no high-tech gobbledegook fest. In fact, it would probably make a compelling film: interesting characters, novel premise, and just enough horrific content for the pit audience. A fine first effort- I hope that the author is nurturing additional creative seeds."
3,Making A difference scholarships,This book was very useful in the process of finding community service scholarships. I would recommend it to everyone.
4,"Not a toy, so hard to rate properly. They were nice.","They were nice wings. They fit a costume for a nine year old well. They seem like they will last a while, time will tell."
3,Great as part of a costume project,Used as a prop for a speech. Dod not 'play with' as a younger child would have. Worked well for our needs.
1,Wings not as represented,We have already sent you a complaint about this product. The item was not as advertized so was of no use to us.
4,Solid 80s rockabilly,"This is some pretty good rockabilly music from the eighties. Most songs are covers (Mystery Train, That's The Way I Feel, Twenty Flight Rock, etc.), with only a handful of originals thrown in, but this should not be a problem. With a lineup of 3 guitars, drums and - my favorite instrument - piano, the BRMC deliver a healthy dose (23 tracks!) of quality rockabilly on this hard-to-find CD.Originally recorded in 1981 & 1985, reissued in 1994 by Eagle Records, Germany."
2,Gobbledy gook,"I found nothing of value in here. This guy is from Harvard so I thought there would be some poignant, new, insightful analysis here. Instead I found pop-psychology stuff that is entirely unhelpful and nothing concrete in which the reader can put into practice. Not only that, it doesnt provide any improvement or insight into the investment psychology literature. I read 1/2, couldnt bare the rest."
4,Head Job,"The real value in this book is taking the time to read and reflect on the many skills an investor should have developed. It is not a ""fun"" read. It is not a book you cannot put down! It should be read over time (like a textbook) and not digested quickly. Some insights may be helpful, like knowing why you hold on to securities that turn out to be losers. It is unlikely to help you decide precisely when to sell but it may free your thinking to know there is a time and you should deal with it. I suggest taking the time to read the book. Expect what you usually get from a book on Psychology."
5,ALL AROUND SCOPE,"This is the telescope they sent on shuttle missions , build is soild the glass and coatings are very good ... The scope is by far the best I have used in the fact you can look at the stars and moon at night in great detail with a scope of this size , buy a nice lens , 20mm is good to start with , do not use cheap glass lens with this scope ... nice size scope to carry around with you and set up easy for a star party ... At daytime its great also as a spot scope and with a DSLR oh my the pixes I took though it with my canon 20d , day and night with this scope ... good all around scope for the money . BUY IT you wont be sorry !!!"
4,Camera Condom,This protects the camera from dings and dirt. It also makes it easier to grip. I always remove it after the dive/hike to make sure it has not trapped any water against the camera. It is inexpensive and IMHO worth using. I would buy it again if I lost my camera.
3,Protective Skin,This Protective Skin was sold at a lot less than the current model by Pentax for the Optio W20.The front does not lay flat due to a larger finger rest on the front of the camera which causes a slight gap at the strap end of the camera. I expect this model of skin was for the Optio W10 originally.I have no problem using this product and would buy it again.
2,Disappointed,"I bought the GPS attachment to the telescope and was quite disappointed with it. It failed to work properly so I returned it. It did not establish my location, was slow to operate, etc."
3,After market radiator,"The radiator cools just fine.Description: A single tube, aluminum core, with plastic tanks. The core is double width for reasonablel flow and cooling. The side brackets are bolt on, and are fairly substantial. All connections are in the proper position for easy hookup.Problem: The brackets were a little too narrow, which required some shimming of the core, for line up. This in turn made the fan shroud slightly narrow, which had to be adjusted at the mounting holes.This configuration probably fits several models, and adjustment may not be nessesary in all cases. I suppose I could have widenedthe mounting holes, but I didn't want to cut up the truck; it is a fairly nice van conversion.Would I buy it again? ................Probably"
4,being discontinued,"This is a beautiful pattern, however the colors are muted, not bright as they seemed to me in the photos. The containers are large. It would have been nice if the sugar bowl had a notch for a spoon. If you are planning to collect more of this pattern many pieces are on sale, but the full set is no longer available."
2,Good product if they are not stale!,"I've ordered these snacks twice. It was the second time around that I was very disappointed. Over half the bags were stale. I called the seller and they informed me that they did not accept returns. They had no real explanation for the stale product other than it's made weekly. They offered to send me a variety box of some of their other snacks in exchange. I had to follow-up with them 2-wks later when nothing showed. As indicated in title, the pork rinds are great if they are fresh. Be forewarned, there is a 50/50 chance the quality will not be as expected."
4,Much Better...,"Infatuator left me wondering what the hell had happened to DC. I went ahead and ""bit"" on Worlds Apart and am glad I did. The two albums are completely different. Gone is the monotonous double bass and sound a like songs. This album is one anthem after another. The only drawback is the production. All the sounds run into one another, unlike ARK burn the sun or anything from Sym X. If you are into melodies and driving rythms than get it. Leave infatuator alone."
2,Not what I wanted,"This is primarily a map of central London. I wanted a map showing the whole London area. This map has been designed to be very sturdy and to cover the major London tourist attractions, and it does that. But it plops down a big ""tube"" map smack on top of the middle of South London so that becomes invisable. I tried to find Portobello Road in Notting Hill, since a number of tourist information sources said that the shopping was good there, but no such road is listed in this map's street index. (I needed a magnifying glass on top of my mild reading glasses to read the index because the print is really, really tiny.) If you have unusually good eyes and want only a map of tourist spots in central London, this may suit you. It did not suit me."
5,Bieber goes ballistic!,"After the first chapter I was glued to the book. I think this is a well-written story with plenty of points of view. I am waiting on a twist in the plot that is foreshadowed nicely. Some use of language, this book is not for young readers. I look foreward to the end of this one and the next book from this duo of Author Extrordinaires."
3,expensive,I ordered this book for my husband who claims he had to have it for a class. It is WAY too expensive to have been published in like 1994. I mean come on. Update your material if you are going to be charging that much.
5,My favorite adhesive,"This is my favorite adhesive. I use it for scrapbooking. The dispenser is very easy to use, and the tabs stick very well. It also doesn't ruin pictures if I have to re-position or remove them, which is important."
3,Good for folks with a large head!,My husband loved it! He has a larger head circumference than most men so it was difficult to find a proper fitting hat. He says it keeps him nice and warm and I think it looks great; only sorry they didn't have one in a brown leather tone with brown fur. Good product!
5,cozy warm head covering!,amazing hat! especially covers ears and head! doesn't even leave your hair as if you had a hat on...hat hair!
2,disappointment,"none of turner's famous works are included in this. also, the color rendition is not so hot. i wish i could return it!"
5,Heartbreaking and frightening,"This is one of the saddest, most compelling, and most frightening books I have ever read. Why are these boot camps still allowed to exist? NHYM has operated since 1970, still running the EC as far as I know. Is there no oversight? If we can inspect nursing homes twice a month, why can't we inspect these so-called ""reformatories"" just as often?"
5,LA Times Review,"""JESUS LAND is a harrowing memoir, a survivor's testimonial, as well as a harsh look at the seamy underbelly of fundamentalist Christianity. But above all, it is a love story... The facts of Scheeres' story are horrific and heartbreaking, but what makes JESUS LAND remarkable is her plain, straightforward, unsentimental point of view... what makes JESUS LAND unique and easy to relate to is its unadorned, dark humor... Many of us could have had the misfortune of stumbling into JESUS LAND but few would have the spirit to survive.""-Los Angeles Times"
5,Hearbreakingly funny and vividly rendered memoir,"This book was written for the author's adopted black brother David, who stole her heart from the day her white parents brought him home, and the story it tells will steal your heart, too.Jesusland is about Julia and David's steadfast loyalty to and love for each other. Scheeres' writing is simultaneously funny and sad as she narrates the outrageous fortunes she and David suffered growing up in rural Indiana in a mixed race family. Blatant racism, shameful violence, and religious zealotry threatened to wedge them apart but never succeeded.Jesusland is a page-turner, the kind of book you can't put down because you come to care so deeply for the characters and the troubles they're having. I found myself rooting for David and Julia, and even when tragedy strikes, ultimately consoled by the saving grace of their love for each other."
5,Your Own Emotions Will Fill in the Gaps,"Julia's story made the scars of growing up as an awkward teenager begin to itch from the first page (I've been on that country road. I've been confronted by the same ignorant red necks). The similarities (and so the justification for her story) end there. Perhaps the most appealing element to this surprisingly readable memoir is her lack of self pity, bordering on humor, in light of the injustices piled on by her narcissistic parents. So readable, in fact, that my wife and I couldn't put it down. I had to share it with her by reading Sam Harris's apropos book ""The End of Faith"". The two books should be sold as a compilation set."
5,Absolutely Brilliant!!,"The best memoir I've read in years, and this is my favorite genre. By turns funny, heart-breaking and haunting. A book that will stay with you forever."
4,A good book for 'history beginners'.,"It's a nice book for people who have some interest in mysteries of the past but who aren't more advanced students of history, with lots of glossy pictures for those people who dislike text-only books. Other than that, the book's main flaw (other than its admitted historical breeziness with certain facts) would be that some of its stories are so well-known as to be tedious, while others are so obscure that they may be inaccessible to the average reader of history. Still, it might inspire you to further research on an unexpectedly interesting topic, and the book's 'voice' is engaging and, for the most part, entertaining."
3,only elastic cities can grow and prosper...,"Using Baltimore as an example, David Rusk believes cities and suburbs can only salvage themselves if they create metropolitan regional areas that are able to accommodate growth, deconcentrate poverty, and make central cities more economically competitive. Rusk's premise is that cities must become ""elastic"" in order to manage growth in tandem with the greater region. It is an attempt to use both fiscal and public policy as a tool to relieve the growing racial and economic disparity between the poor cities and the affluent suburbs. In this book Rusk outlines a strategy to help metropolitan regions become elastic and once again regain their competitive advantage. Recommended."
5,wonderful book!,"My sister bought these books for her sons and she lent them to me for my children. She loves them so much that she wants them back for her grandchildren! This was a great book - the whole series is great. We have about 30 of these books and my children love to look at them. They particularly like how the plastic insert make the pages look different when you flip the plastic insert over.This book gives basic information about whales - explains the differences between the two kinds of whales, what kind of food they eat, how they breathe, etc. It doesn't get into very detailed explanations but it's not necessary. It just gives you enough information to interest the reader in the subject. The pictures are great, not too scary. Excellent books for grade school kids, especially those learning to read.I would recommend this book as well as the other books in this series."
3,OK quality,This moon filter was inexpensive so I wasn't expecting much. If I were to do it over again I think I would have spent a little more for a better one. Main issue is the body is plastic and the threads were creased from the factory. It still works OK but I don't think it will last long.
1,Unable to use it,I ordered this to use with a Celestron C 90 which was in the same order and is nonfunctional so far. As well there were no instructions to explain how to use it.
2,not impressed,"I order this one over the metal one to save five bucks. I figured I didn't need a great one to look at the moon. But; wish I would have paid the few bucks extra. The plastic threads are uneven, and its very difficult to screw in the the eyepiece evenly. It feels like the whole plastic body was deformed from heat.Just pay the extra five bucks and get the metal one."
5,Rightly Dividing the Word of Truth,This book is essential for those who have a serious interest in studying the Word of God.Basic principles must be understood before proceeding with the detailed study of Biblical doctrine.This book is an excellent source of information for the one who is new to studying or for the one who has been at it many years. A most profitable book for all.I would recommend this book readily.John
3,It's OK,"The lathe works well and is very helpful in some situations. It holds rounded objects steadily as you rotate them to work around the sides. However, I was disappointed when I received the lathe in the mail and found out it was made of plastic. Although it is sturdy, the description did not mention it was simulated wood, which looks real in the picture. I also wish there was a holder on one end of the lathe to stand the egg/ornament when working on the top and the bottom portions of it."
3,okay,"its not something i'm jumping up and down over. after trying it out there are drawbacks. you are limited to how much area you can paint on at the ends. since you can't paint all of egg at once, what's the difference in just holding the egg and painting half. then when one half dries, paint the other half??"
5,hobby craft lathe,excellent product. great for craft project. Does the job for decorating Easter eggs and Christmas balls.
4,Works well,The lathe worked well for the pysaki eggs that I did. I found that I could free up both hands by clamping it to the edge of the table
1,"Expected a new unit, recieved used and abused.","There is a large straight slot screw on the top of the pump that looks like a drain plug. This screw has been tampered with and damaged by overtightening. The rubber seal under the screw head has been ruined as well. There a traces of red silicone sealer on the the damaged seal where someone attempted to kludge it. My guess is the motor is wet inside and will fail due to internal corrosion. Aside from that, it looks like it was a really nice pump before some clown abused it. I will try to get a replacement in new condition.'"
1,Crap!,"Cast iron? The grid on bottem to filter out objects is plastic. Mine came re-packaged, with the cheap plastic grid in pieces. Amazon was prompt on my refund and I went with a better ""well known"" model that really is cast iron."
1,$91 for 1000g of salt?,Go to the grocery store and buy some sea salt. You'll get the same quantity of salt for at leat 20 times less than what they're charging here.
5,There's only so much table salt that you can consume!,I have low blood pressure and need a lot of salt. There is only so much table salt that you can consume. These tablets make it easy for me to get the required sodium.
1,This book is as useless as the first edition,"This author previously wrote a book called secrets of methamphetamine manufacture, which has so many errors in it that nothing will work as stated. See erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/eleusis/eleusis.vs.fester.html for a thorough analysis of the mistakes in this book. This new edition is equally as useless. The author obviously has no real knowledge of chemistry and He should be the last person on earth to write a book on this subject. It is a complete waste of money. You can find much more accurate information free on the internet."
1,0 STARS - TERRIBLE,"This is honestly the kind of stuff that gives metal and hardcore a bad name. Not only is this album overtly violent, cliched, and cheesy, but the songwriting lacks any sort of real talent and the songs mostly rely on their use of audio clips from movies and other such sources. Quite frankly, the cover art and song titles alone would and should be enough to justify and solidify my review of this piece of trash. I am surprised Tribunal even bothered with releasing two albums from this band when they have released much better albums and ep's in times past. If you want something new and good off this label, pick up the He Is Legend EP and if you just want something new and heavy, check out Unearth, Himsa, As I Lay Dying, or Glass Casket, but whatever you do, avoid this garbage."
1,This doe NOT include an AC adapter!,I ordered this product specifically because I needed a replacement AC adapter for my Wii and the cooling station was a bonus. This item has a misleading title and I will be returning it.
3,"Okay, nothing special","While I think the idea of a cooling stand is great, this product would be much better if the 'storage' spaces for the remote were actually charging spaces. I thought the remotes charged when inserted, but when I got the item it's clear that in order to charge the batteries you have to remove them and put them in a small separate charging station. Not the ideal design, but technically does both cooling and charging."
5,Wii Cooling Console - It's the Best!,"This product works great and is much needed because we play our Wii constantly for hours! Love the neat glowing blue color, too!"
3,Aptly Titled Book,"I really like Richard Lewis. He is a very funny man. But the title of this book is so apt. Reading it was...kind of...depressing. But the book I'm sure has much in it that would be very helpful to those caught up in addiction. What makes it worthwhile to the rest of us is the painful glimpse it gives you into the mind and psyche of someone dealing with Depression. And the descriptions Richard gives you of his relationships with his mother and father are heartbreaking. But the description of the redemptive scene between him and his dying mother in the nursing home is worth wading through some of the other weightier areas of the book to get to. This book is very painfully honest. It would have been easier for him to gloss over some of the rough stuff and would probably have certainly made him look better, but to battle addiction I think brutal honesty is probably called for and Richard certainly comes through in this regard."
4,Must read for Richard Lewis fans,"A must read for Richard Lewis fans, fans of comedy, or anyone interested in addiction. He is an amazing man."
1,Greatly Depressing.,"I bought this book at a tag sale for 50 cents and if I remembered the address I'd return it. Alcoholism is sad and serious; however, Lewis is a self-indulgent egomaniacal narcissist who thinks he is the most important person to ever recover from the disease. He offers superficial reflections on his disease and recovery, and is barely able to conceal what this book is truly about: his obsession with himself, his career, and friends he repeatedly refers to as ""famous"" but never names. No idea who gave this man a book deal, or who edited it for that matter - it could be cut down to four pages and it would offer the same amount of value. Depressing."
5,Richard Lewis' Feelings Exposed,There are no pictures because this is an internal view of Richard. Pictures would detract from getting to know the real person inside. This book lets you see him as he really is now and how he got there.This book lets you know Richard Lewis from his point of view. Why he thinks what he thinks without any necessary segue from thought to thought.
2,Doesn't get much worse,"I love Richard Lewis on stage. But this is beyond bad. Was there an editor on this project??? It's the most repetitious book I've ever half-read (I couldn't finish it). It could easily have been condensed into something 1/3 the length. That aside, I feel this is not a book about addiction. Instead, it's a thinly-veiled attempt by Lewis to portray himself as a bigger celebrity than he actually is, and perhaps more so, to portray himself as a major ladykiller. Ahem. I could tolerate the charade if the book were even remotely funny....but it's not. C'mon Richard! Luckily the book was given to me, and it will be passed on to make sure the next reader doesn't buy it."
3,Richard meet Spike,"There's some interesting stuff in Lewis's book. His style reminds me so much of Spike Gillespie...All the Wrong Men and One Perfect Boy : A Memoir by Spike GillespieHis book (and likewise hers) lets me get into the mind of a hyperverbal, hyperactive personality. Very exciting, but tiring!I cringe at how he treats women. His biggest addiction seems to be to cruelty. Like in that movie about rehab w/Sandra Bullock, maybe he should try having a pet before he attempts a ""people relationship."" But he is brutally honest. That's worth something.Sobriety is tough and I admire anyone who embraces it. Richard Lewis lays his soul bare and it ain't pretty. It took guts to do it."
1,depressing,"I love Richard Lewis, but this book was actually ... depressing. I had to stop reading and just skim the rest. It was repetitious. I never really understood what pain of his childhood he was trying to escape by drinking. I think some editor should have fixed the tone to make it either funnier or more-serious-and-readable. It was too shticky to be meaningful, but too serious to be funny."
5,"Great to go along with the book ""Humphrey's First Christmas""","My daughter who turned 3 Jan. 5. LOVES this camel. Every night before bed around Christmas she wanted to read the book ""Humphrey's First Christmas"". Even after going to a live Nativity, she called the Camel (who's real name is Moses) Humphrey. I ordered this camel on Dec 22 and received it Dec 26. She LOVES it. He is perfect. I was very impressed that I received it so quickly. He is bigger than I realized, but my daughter adores him and that's all that matters."
5,great child remedy,I rely a lot on Hyland's for my 3 year old. This product gives me peace of mind that I am not giving her chemicals
4,fabulous classic,"Great family video beloved by every age group in our family. The new ""pop-up video"" feature is well done, informative, and entertaining. Worth the money to replace your old VHS version!"
5,"""SUPER, SUPERCALI. SUP. OR WHATEVER THE INFERNAL THING IS""","I LOVE THIS MOVIE. ITS ONE OF MY FAVORITE DISNEY MOVIES, SECOND ONLY BEHIND THE CARTOON VERSION OF COURSE, OF 101 DALMATIANS. THE SONGS ARE GREAT, I LOVE DICK VAN DYKE, AND JULIE ANDREWS, AND THE REST OF THE CAST. JUST A PHENOMINAL MOVIE FOR PEOPLE OF ALL AGES. I ASKED FOR THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION FOR CHRISTMAS, AND IF I DON'T GET IT, I'LL GO OUT AND BUY IT MYSELF THE NEXT DAY. A TREMENDOUS MOVIE FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY TO ENJOY! HIGHLY RECOMENDED."
1,I could not get the video to play.,"Every minute or so, it would stop and have to buffer. I tried pausing and it did not help. I tried starting from the beginning and it did not help at all"
1,HAHAHAHA! GIVE ME A BREAK,"This is one of the worst films to hit the Disney masterpiece collection. It's an overrated movie for ages 5 and younger. The characters didn't interest me at all and The ""CHIM CHIMITY"" song was awful and so where were the other songs. If Disney dosent get their act together they will fall and DreamWorks will rise."
5,Mary Poppins (40th Anniversary Edition),Mary Poppins is a classic Disney movie. I remember watching it as a child. I had this movie on VHS and liked it so well that I have recently replaced it with a DVD. My eight year old niece liked the movie so I have purchased her one for Christmas. Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke make it a wonderful performance for people of all ages to enjoy. It has a mixture of cartoons with live performances that gives a it a twist for good family entertainment. I hope you enjoy it as well as my family has.
1,Mary Poppins DVD,"I am unable to play this Mary Poppins DVD as it is not for my region and will not play. My grandchildren were extremely disappointed and I felt I had been duped. I think Amazon should send me a replacement that will play in Australia. I have bought before and always been happy, but will hesitate before I buy from Amazon again."
4,Classic book,The price was fair. Works fine and arrived on time. I'm happy with it.This is extra text to meet the stupid minimum requirements from Amazon.
4,Classic children's movie,"Our daughter is 4 and she enjoys this movie. She loves songs and we thought Mary Poppins would be a great movie to watch. For example, she also loves Sound of Music songs. To be fair, its hard to maintain the attention of a 4 year old and she doesn't quite get the whole story, so after a couple of attempts, we just use the section of the DVD that plays only the songs. Its like a video jukebox.I think when she is older, she can appreciate the story more but the dancing and singing sequences are still very entertaining. They are dated but still classic."
5,Best family film ever made,"I truly believe that Mary Poppins is absolutely the best family film ever made. Although it is somewhat long, possibly pushing children's attention span to their limits, it is free of violence, foul language, and sexual inuendo. The entire premise of the movie is getting a very strict banker to realize that life CAN be fun and not just working one's life away to gain material posessions. One of the very first movies I ever saw, when it was originally released in 1964, and still my favorite. I recommend this film to anyone with children."
5,Supercalifragilisticexpealidociously Fantabulous!,"I have loved this movie since as far back as I can remember,and I never tire of watching Mary's wonderful magic, the mischeivous Jane and Michael, the humor of Bert, and just enjoying everything this movie has to offer. There are no boring parts, and I think the more you watch it, the better it gets. If you have never before seen this movie, I strongly reccommend that you do!"
5,"This Movie is Defintately a ""Jolly Holiday""","I had not seen this movie for a very long time until last week I borrowed a copy from my cousin and it was very good.It was so much better than I remembered.My favorite part of this movie is the scene where Mary,Bert,and the children go into the painting and they see the pinguin waiters who do a very funny dance with bert,and they sing my favorite song in the movie called ""Jolly Holiday"".This is a very good movie.I recomend this movie to anyone."
5,it's the best movie!,"Mary Poppins is my favorite movie. It has great animation, good music, good actors.....everything's good!Even my 2 year-old brother loves to watch it! My whole family likes it. I think that it is Julie Andrew's best movie."
2,Quite a bit of sticking and stalling,"There is no question about the quality of the movie. It is an exceptonal production. My ONLY issue is with the quality of the disc. Why does it continually stick while running? I know the simple answer is ""Check your dvd player"" I ran other discs with no problems so I must assume it is a faulty disc. Is there perhaps some way that it can be safely cleaned? Incidentally, disc #2 ran with no problems."
5,Great family-friendly movie,"Timeless. In this digital format, I saw the colors more true to life than when I watched this as a kid! Sounds great in surround sound too!"
3,Disney Incorrect,"Anyone who has a 16x9, widescreen television will be disappointed to discover that the technical information provided by Disney. They released this disc saying that it was in a widscreen ANAMORPHIC format. It is not. It is widscreen (letterbox) but it is not anamorphic so it is distorted when displayed on a widscreen television. It's disappointing because this film is one of Walt Disney's crowning achievements and it's too bad that they didn't put it out in the best possible format."
5,mary poppins cd,one of my favorite all time movies - and was delivered quick and in as is condition! Thanks!
4,The music did it,"This was the first Disney movie released after I was born. The music did it for me & the musical numbers. Not the best, other wise the movie was too long."
3,What about restoring deleted scenes?,"Like many people, I saw the movie as a youngster and had the sound track record. When the DVD first came out, I was upset to find that some of it was missing! For example, a scene where the kids are actually making the kite with paper and glue with a too-large brush and the dog makes a mess of things; at the very end Burt saying ""I love you, Mary Poppins"" as she floats off. With DVDs we expect a longer ""directors cut"" of a movie, not an abridged shortened version!Looking at the other editions for sale here, I see the running length is the same. So, what I'd like to know is: is the full reature restored in this 40th anniversary edition? I'd by it if it was."
4,Classic,"For its time, this was a creative movie, and they managed to merge the animation in with the live-action scenes pretty well. Keep in mind that this is quite different from the book in some ways, but to be honest, the book is a bit bland compared to the movie. The film has more color, more fantasy, it's pretty awesome, and Julie Andrews does a simply wonderful job as Mary Poppins."
5,Classic Movie,"This movie has always been a favorite of mine and my daughter is at the age where I think she would like it, and she did. We've watched this movie multiple times since I purchased it. It's just one of those movies that everyone enjoys watching and will always be a classic!"
4,"""Helps the medicine go down...""","Mary Poppins is a Walt Disney classic. Julie Andrews plays the title role and she won an Oscar for her flawless performance. Andrews is pure delight, wish I had a nanny like her as a youngster. Dick Van Dyke is a gem as well, great songs and dance numbers. Mary Poppins is a family treasure to be enjoyed over and over again. I highly recommend it."
5,Best Disney musical ever,"During the 90's Disney flicks were lame, drippy musicals. This is not the case with Mary Poppins. The songs are still fresh and vibrant. As a whole this is the most re-watchable musical flick ever, so I'm happy to have it in DVD. Highly recommended to adults, even those that were put off Disney by ""The Little Mermaid"" and the rest of the Eisner era dreck-to-theater.However, I have to admit that from a technical point of view, Mary Poppins shows its age. The blend between humans and cartoons is not that good, so you have to try harder to keep your disbelief suspended.Anyway, it has great nostalgic value for me. Perhaps kids might like it, too... I'll show it to my little nephews and tell you later."
4,My Kid Loves It,"This is more like a play, we don't need much settings. We have fewers characters and a simpler plot than The Sound of Music.Having said that, this is still a marvelous movie. I like the chimney sweeper and one man band. I like the part of Mary Poppins or even Mr Bank and his woman-liberalizing wife and even the captain next door-- he reminds me of Captain Shotover of Bernard Shaw. Now that Harry Potter, The Worst Witch are so popular, winds are certainly blowing Mary Poppins' way too. I rank this right next to The Sound of Music."
5,Family classic,"My 4 year old son, 2 1/2 year old son and 1 year old daughter all enjoy this film. They mainly enjoy the singing but my 4 year old is able to get some of the jokes. A nice video for family movie night since it is not scary or too fast paced."
5,PRACTICALLY PERFECT IN EVERY WAY,A simply magical musical. Disney's finest. I enjoy this film more now than when I was a kid. Exceptional digital and audio transfer.
1,DVD player couldn't read DVD,I guess you get what you pay for. Only $2 plus another $2-3 for shipping. It's a DVD for the UK or Ireland. It's printed in tiny letters on the DVD. I obviously thought I was buying a DVD for the U.S.Bummer
3,Mixed review,My 3 yr old son loves so many movies. But Mary Poppins just isn't one of them for him. Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and the Muppet Movie were even a hit with him.I still love this movie myself though. It's a beautiful movie!
4,Not sure about adults...,"I was unable to sit through this. Yes, I did like it as a kid (I'm 40 years old now). I just got the sense you not only need to be a ""kid at heart"" for this one, you got to BE A KID. It's just way too sugary sweet (not just a spoonful of sugar, but a full cup)... maybe it's just me. I didn't last more than a half hour before I had to turn it off. OTOH I recently saw ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" (1971) and greatly enjoyed it. Maybe it's just me. Anyway... put it on for your kids, and go do something else while it's playing.P.S. (edit) -- so many ""not helpful"" ratings... was it really not helpful in terms of making a purchasing decision, or did you just not like or agree with my opinion?"
1,Won't buy until there's Blu-Ray,"Simple as that! Disney is squeezing the final teet here and milking the masses for another, ""Gotta Own"" DVD. I won't buy this until the Blu-Ray comes out."
2,Waste of Money,Thought I had a classic..Realized how dated and out of touch this whole sappy story really was.But Julie Andrews certainly is way cute...and Dick Van Dyke is entertaining.....for him.Don't bother adding this to your collection.Sorry I wasted my money here.
2,The years have not been kind to this one,"Like all of us, our granddaughter loves movies. She's watched classics like the Wizard of Oz (a fave!), Black Beauty, and Dumbo countless times. While these films do show their age, they have nonetheless held up well over time and we've all viewed them over and over. I had never actually seen Mary Poppins until recently, and found this film to be quite disappointing--as did the grandchild, who was ready to hit the road before the kids even appeared. Everything about this movie is annoying, from the made-for-TV type effects, to the accents, to the very predictable story itself. It's neither fun, nor satisfying, and definitely not engaging for kids. Get the anniversary edition of Wizard of Oz instead--it's a far, far better film!"
3,Inclined to giggle,"A little boring at times, this is often a very enjoyable movie with likeable characters and some nice animation. Drags a lot. A collection of some very hectic calamedy moments and some serious adult nonsense."
2,Disappointed,"I hear there are two versions of Mary Poppins' DVD going around - a single layer and a dual layer version.I unfortunately and unknowingly bought the single layer. Middle of the movie, it stops dead, an animated hand appears showing a disc being turned over and you have to leap up and flip your disc for the movie to resume. This is almost sacriledge in any movie but to do it in Mary Poppins is a crime. It kills the flow and destroys the magic. It should be clearly marked on the label if you have to flip your disc.So be warned all: check if you are getting the dual layer version on any long movie. If not, do not buy it."
5,Speedy service,I needed this movie asap for a friend and her children before they moved. It arrived when you said it would. The 40th anniv edition is wonderful--according to my friend!
5,A great old movie!,"Having just seen the Broadway Play, I wanted my granddaughter to see the original with Julie Andrews and Dick VanDyke. It was so colorful and wonderful. So glad we found it on Amazon."
5,great,"what could be better than Mary Poppins! The singing, the dancing, the musical score is the best! All children will grow up finer for this movie....very enriching."
1,Poor quality online viewing,"The online streamed version of this movie is NOT widescreen. It is pan & scan and looks like a low-quality YouTube video circa 2003. I did a bandwidth speedtest showing 10 Mbps download but Amazon's video connect shows 1 of 5 bars, so their video server cannot handle decent quality video. Refund please."
2,Mediocre Movie,"""Mary Poppins"" is a movie that I'm just going to say I never enjoyed, even as a kid. Yeah yeah, I have no soul or heart, but I just don't like this film one bit. I can't stand it when musicals come up with a musical number every five minutes. Musicals that do really annoy me, and this is an example. There's always talk that this movie was famous for combing live action and animation. but that's only for what--ten to fifteen minutes? There's no adventure, no heartwarming, it''s just people singing pointlessly. I remember getting bored with this utterly ridiculous movie. I'm not much a fan of the Sherman Brothers, or at least not in THIS movie. Mary Poppins herself is not an interesting character, correcting poor Michael when he's not perfect, just acting firm most of the time. I am definetly never going to buy this movie."
1,Shame on Disney,"It seems every time you turn around another ""Special must have edition"" comes out on any movie. With the ecnomy the way it is I would hope that the studio executive's would take that into consideration and not get us to buy another copy of a DVD we already own.I for one am not going to buy the 45th Anniversary Edition since I already own the 40th Anniversary Edition. If everyone waits 5 years you can probably buy the 50th Anniversary Edition."
4,Practically perfect in every way,"Everyone has seen Mary Poppins. Let's cut the mustard and talk about the DVD.Sound 3/5 - Using ProLogic receiver, the songs are blatantly pasted in. The difference in the sound quality during the transition from dialogue to song is horrible. On the bright side, the songs sound great, and the dialogue sound isn't that bad considering that the movie is 25 years old.Picture Quality 4.5/5 -Excellent.Extra Features 0/5 -There are none, so don't bother looking."
3,"Avoid the ""Enhanced Mix"" and choose ""Original Theatrical Mix""","This review is on the 40th anniversary DVD, not the film itself - actually this is more of a warning than a review. Please, avoid the ""enhanced home theater mix"" at all costs. It is a distasteful remix of the original soundtrack that seems to be a misguided attempt to update the film to have a more ""noisy"" and ""modern"" feel. The excessive bass is especially inappropriate. The original theatrical mix is clear, magical and engrossing, and was actually nominated for an Academy award. The fact that it is not the default option on this disc is an insult to the people who created the original sound mix."
5,An Extraordinary Classic with Super High Quality DVD Technology,"This film is an extraordinary, timeless classic, and with the incredible technology in this DVD release, everything comes to life. It's a joy to watch, as it always was, and now looks even better than it did on film. Simply a superb tribute to the wonderful people that created this orignial film, and the brilliance of the people that give it larger than life quality on DVD. Would make a great gift anytime!"
5,Mary Poppins Movie,"The best movie every! Super fast delivery too. This is a wonderful movie for any child or adult - lots of singing, dancing, and just fun!"
5,Love it,I shall never get bored of this movie. As well as Sound of Music. Every house should have one I
5,Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!,I grew up watching this movie and I still enjoy it. It's one of those rare gems that pleases both kids and adults. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to take a flight of fancy.
4,"Excellent Film, Wish Amazon VOD were clearer on HD Playback","This film is still a classic, so I'm only giving this 4 stars because though it has a big ""HD"" ribbon on the corner of it's displayed product picture and didn't offer seperate SD/HD versions when I bought it on PC, it only plays in SD on the Amazon VOD app for Xbox.Sigh."
5,Mary Poppins,"I love anything with Julie Andrews in it. I bought this particular dvd for a young wome\an who has celebal palsey for she is almost completly an invalid, she loves Julie Andrews so much she wants to watch everyone of Julie's musical movies."
5,"!Bravo Lorenzo, hai fatto bene!","This is definately one of his best albums. Jovanotti is a truly accomplished musician and it shows in this amazing disc. All the songs have their own distinct beauty and beat which is why I think its his best work. If your a fan, you will not be dissapointed."
5,"Bravo, Awesome!","Really, really good CD. Original, fresh and positive.Definitly will touch you. Get your CD and listen with open ears,closed mouth and open heart. Good job, sei stato bravo Lorenzo!"
1,Franklin Rolodex,Misleading description. Will not do the things it advertises. Usless piece of junk. Don't buy because you will be wasting your money.
3,...,"Vague enough to enfuse with personal meaning. Meaningless read hard, and broad read softly. A good book if you want to sway in the romantic waters of an indefinite God, but hardly the work to peak behind the curtain. It studies the fabric. Full of delicious quotes, irresistable."
4,Catchy mix of tunes!,"If you're from Arizona, you can take pride in this great local band. Although some lyrics aren't clean, the tunes are fun to listen to and fun to learn. The Phunk Junkeez get you into the music, and relate to you in songs such as Thick Like Mornin' Dick, Why, Radio Sucks, and Uncontrollable Urge. Just give it a spin... you won't regret it... But be warned if you're ears are extra sensitive!"
4,interesting read,I really liked this book and the research they did although at times it gets a little tedious and repetitive I would recommed it. Another request for more words. I said what I needed to say like it or leave it.
5,GREAT,The VHS-C Cassette Adapter worked great in the VCR. Played all the old (20 year +) tapes. I then attached the VCR (no TV needed) to the computer and dumped to DVD. Great purchase!
1,This item is worthless.,"The product is cheaply made and doesn't work. The door for sliding in the VHS-c tape jams, sticks, and is very difficult to use. This is a TDK brand and I actually have TDK brand vhs-c cassettes. Funny thing is - the TDK vhs-c tapes don't fit properly in the TDK brand adaptor. I had a previous vhs-c adaptor where the door slid open with a battery. That worked much better. I'm unable to use this to view my tapes. Buy another brand. This one is worthless."
2,NOT MOTORIZED,This is a manual adapter and there are much cheaper ones on the market out there. I personally had a dysfucntion...... and thought it was motorized buy the motorized one. This one is ok.
5,"""On the Trail of the Wild""","Mr. Ben-Shahar does a great job at presenting his research and personal experiences in various Southafrican bush areas. In addition to his interesting narratives, Ben-Shahar provides us with the opportunity to enjoy some of his outstanding photographs. A must read if planning a trip to a Southafrican destination."
5,JEET KUNE DO -- THE WAY IT WAS MEANT TO BE PRESENTED,"""JEET KUNE DO: Bruce Lee's Commentaries on the Martial Way"" is THE definitive book on Bruce Lee's martial art. John Little has done a superlative job of locating, formatting, editing and presenting Bruce Lee's writings in a manner that is comprehensible, informative and inspiring. In many ways this book far surpasses ""The Tao of Jeet Kune Do"" which, in comparison, looks to be so many of Bruce's notes simply tossed into a stew. This book presents Bruce Lee's writings and sketches on his art of Jeet Kune Do in an organized and comprehensive manner -- much like Bruce Lee presented it himself when he created his art in 1967. This book is, quite simply, the best book on Jeet Kune Do ever written. But then, that shouldn't be suprising -- it was written by Bruce Lee."
5,Return of the Dragon,"Commentaries of Bruce Lee is one of the most comprehensive collections of quotes, diagrams, and theories on the market today. Integration of Jeet Kune Do in Movies adds an element of excitement, to the book. I found the book very well organized. The five elements of Jeet Kune Do were describe in comprehesive detail. Narrative was easy to read supported by a series of thoughts, techniques, and insights that kept my attention for hours. One of the best Martial Art Books, I've read this year."
5,An Instant Classic!,"This book is a must for everybody that studies Jun Fan Jeet Kune Do. In reading Bruce Lee's hand written notes, we can now learn the 'why' instead of just learning the 'how' when it comes for fighting."
3,A good basic watch,"This is a good, inexpensive, basic watch. If you just want a watch that will let you know the time in either 12 or 24 hour formats, has an alarm feature and a no frills band, this is the one for you. It is modestly priced. This is the watch I've been using in both civilian and military worlds for over 15 years. The alarm works well in a low noise environment and when you're not totally exhausted by continuous 18-20 hour work days. I've slept through it it beeping in my ear, then. Additionally, the ones I've had usually run about 8 seconds fast per month. I also like that it has only 3 buttons to manipulate, to get to all the features, alarm, stop watch, lap timer, to change the date/time, and to illuminate the watch face to read it in the dark. All in all a very good watch that I'll keep on buying."
4,A solid timepiece,"This is a nice solid timepiece. If you wear it too tightly, the band may break off eventually, but other than that, it puts up with a lot of abuse. It's very convenient having it be waterproof enough that I just take it into the pool or shower or lake with me.If it had a countdown timer as well as its other features, I'd rate it a full 5 stars, instead of the 4 stars I am giving it."
1,poor alternative to Casio W-71,"the features on this watch are very minimal and not well laid out.you can get a very similar looking watch with a LOT more useful features, the Casio W-71not only that, but this watch is featured twice on Amazon; search 'F-91W' and the same watch comes up at $11.48 w/ free S.S. shipping. Even at that price, I suggest not getting it.No month or year on displayNo count-down timeretc.(see my other review on the other offering of this watch for more details)Spend a little more and get the W-71-1V for $18.45."
2,The author just doesn't understand,"I read the book and agreed with some points and threw the book down indisgust at other points.As a woman who adores high heels, makeup, perfume, fancy clothes, a fewpiercings, and a tattoo on my ...umm never mind, I must admit it isenjoyable and empowering to be able to dress and express myself this way.I do not dress for men, but for myself.The author does not seem to realize the vast majority of women enjoydressing and being feminine.By the way, high heels only hurt if you are not accustomed to them. Theydon't damage your feet if you purchase the right size and shape."
1,Never worked,"I orderedWii Charge 'N Play Dual Chargeras a Christmas present for my granddaughter. By the time I found out that it didn't work, the 30 day return period for Beach Audio had passed and they were unwilling to help me with a replacement. They gave me a 877 number for the manufacturer and I'm still waiting for a call back. I'm very disappointed."
2,Not worth it!,"The cartridge that came with the vicks humidifier only lasted about 10 fillings (they claim 30-40). I think it would be just as cost effective (and easier) to just buy distilled water to use in the humidifier, and skip the filter cartridge."
5,Replacement cartridges,I have not used the replacement cartidges yet. I'm certain that they will work well as they are the same as the one that came with my vaporizer.
5,Breathing Easier,"I needed a new filter for my ultrasonic humidifier. I couldn't find it locally so ordered it online. A great experience - love to just sit in my pj's, place an order and watch out for the UPS Delivery man. I got expectly what I ordered in a timely fashion. Will order again when needed."
1,"Unfortunately, one size does not fit all.","I had ordered the Sunbeam Model 6589 Ultrasonic Demineralization Cartridge but was sent the DC-51 as a replacement because the 6589 is no longer being manufactured. Unfortunately, the DC-51 is about 1/2"" thicker than the original 6589 and that extra thickness prevented the tank for my Sunbeam Model 701 Ultrasonic Humidifier from being able to seat properly. I am unable to use purified water with my Sunbeam, so the dreaded ""white dust"" problem made it necessary to return the entire humidifier because there is no usable demineralization cartridge available for it.A very poor job of coordinating specifications for a replacement of a discontinued product, in my opinion. I suspect that some other Sunbeam Ultrasonic Humidifiers will have similar problems using the Kaz DC-51 as a replacement for the 6589 because of their similar design."
1,I hate giving 1 stars,I do hate giving 1 stars but I have to in this case. I think it is better to just buy distilled water (and no filter) for your humidifier.
1,De-mineralization cartdrige,a goey stuff forms in spite of the filter that clogs the humidifier from creating the mist. Much dissapointed
3,As Expected,The service provided by the vendor was timely. The items arrived undamaged. They are a bit over priced by the manufacturer.
5,Great Replacement Filter,Fit perfectly and works great. I'm not changing the filter as often as recommended so it'll be in the humidfier for a while.
3,Product info u should know,"I think that this product was nice but i had a problem when I washed it, the threads started to come apart and it had those little balls of cotton on it after you placed it in the dryer. I went back to the store and told them what had happened and I recieved another one and I think it is perfect now. I do not have any other problems with it since."
2,Let me save you some money.,"I have scratches on my urethane treated oak floor. I opened the product box and was directed to put drops of water on the scratches. If the floor turned black, the instructions said not to use the product, indicating that the scratches are too deep. Do this before ordering the product. I don't know if it works on scratches that are not deep, but for what it's worth, I did not consider mine to be deep."
3,not the same band...so it seems,"this is a way differant approach on the style of music steel attack once was... they used to be awesome now there just ok... like instead of singing about knights and swords and dragons, they sing about religion, im a christian so it makes it awkward for me to listen to it...but if you think of it as a differant band then its great!! but it is definatly not a good representation of ""the"" band steel attack."
3,The cd set is one of the better soundtrack of Rozsa's music,"This 2 cd set consists one of the best movie music score of Rozsa, and the sound quality of the cd is only average as the Cd was produced in 2002 compared to the more recent issues of soundtrack music( Ben Hur in particular) of Rozsa produced by the label,Film Score Monthly. Though the fans of Rozsa may want to have a complete score of this movie, what contains in this set is not complete. Also, there is no reason to buy this set at the inflated price asked by the speculator sellers. For Rozsa' fans and admirers, it is better to wait for the reissue of this soundtrack music by labels, such as Film Score monthly, or Intrada."
3,Everything is great except the sound.,"It's easy to tell this release is a labor of love. Every aspect of the packaging reflects an investment of considerable time, effort, and devotion. And Rozsa's music is truly worthy of continued availability. The music was recorded, unfortunately, at a point in time when recording technology was a pale reflection of what exists today. So even though the sound is better than what I ever heard on an LP, the sonics are still somewhat faded. It would be great if this music were re-recorded with a top-flight orchestra and today's state-of-the-art equipment. I doubt that will happen since since the chance of making enough sales to cover recording expenses is most unlikely. For that reason I recommend purchase of this current set, even though you may find the sonics somewhat lacking."
5,Thank goodness for meastering!,"I think was probably one of the last people to purchase the original deluxe edition of this disc in vinyl before MGM stopped making it. I paid about as much for it as I did for this wonderful new release.I even had the souvenier program that came with it. Only problem with the one in the new set is the very small print. Anyway, the newly remastered disc is a true masterpiece. I didnt realize how much music had been eliminated from the original recording,even though I purchased the video several years ago. I particularly liked some of the background information,which pretty much summed up my feelings about the movie being underappreciated for years. The same can certainly be said for this wonderous CD!Bravo!"
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with these sheets when I put them on my guestroom bed.The bed is queensize - and yes I ordered queensize - but the sheets were way too big for it, and did not look well. I've never had this problem before when buying sheets for it."
4,"Smooth, nice-looking sheets","We've used these sheets about half the time over the last five years. They still look and feel very nice. In fact, they look dressier than most sheets. My husband likes them more than I do. I like them for looks more than for sleeping. If you prefer a softer, thinner, more comforting sheet for sleeping, keep looking."
3,"They are okay, but they fade fast","I gave these sheets to my mother and my husband (which means myself) for Christmas last year. They are nice and comfortable, but unfortunately, the pillow cases faded. They are so faint, they are almost cream colored. I might have thought it was just a fluke with the blue set, but we also have the cream-colored set, and those pillow cases faded as well, but to a rose color. Very strange. We are not worried because no one sees them but us, but they are not attractive."
4,"Good gun, a few flaws.","This is the first airsoft gun i've ever bought, so I really don't know what i'm comparing it too. Overall, it shoots alright, a lot better than I would of thought. The laser on mine didn't work, and was quite baffled to see the instructions in japanese. The magazine holds around 50 rounds which is pretty good, I was expecting only 40. It came with a 700MAH 7.2 volt battery, and just noticed on the intructions it is best to use 800MAH, i'm not sure what the difference is, but my battery is pretty shoddy. You get what you paid for. :)"
1,incomplete item,"We purchased this item which was shipped from the manufacturer. What we got was an item which appears to have been previously sold as it was missing some of the peripheral components such as the light and laser sight. Also, the battery will not take a charge and so the gun will not work. We bought another similar air rifle at the same time and it works great."
2,not too good.,"not too good of a gun. for the price it isnt really worth it. The gun does shoot pretty well though, it does hurt at 15feet but anything beyond 20 it just feels like a mosquito bite. If u use the fake silencer the bullets fly everywhere. and my semi and full auto switch broke really easily. i do recommend this gun if u just wanna mess with ur friends, but if u actually wanna play dont buy this gun."
5,Great Scent Even Great For Adults!,"I am using these for myself, an adult. I like that the scent is just nice and clean (i usually go for unscented and didn't realize these were scented) I have sensitive skin and these are soothing. They are study. The box is sturdy. They are a great deal."
1,Motherboard died after inmediately 2 years of use,"This computer is the first and last Sony laptop I will buy. Immediately after 2 years, the computer cannot be used for more than one hour. I took it to a Sony repair specialist who determined the mother board had died. Estimated repairs were quoted at +$800 which nowadays can buy a Centrino Duo notebook (New). I am very dissapointed with SONY, this item was purchased at nearly $1,600.00 two years ago, now it's gone. I do not recommend SONY notebooks because of their poor quality control, this is not an isolated case: I know of three other customers with identical quality control problems in one city alone. Toshiba, DELL, and Gateway are best buys. I have never had any problems with those brands. Serial number for my machine is 281792309321022 should anyone at SONY wish to contact me."
1,Bad Bad Bad product watch out,For all of you out there do not fall to this cheap product.I bought a sony notebook PCG-K13 last year and paid a lot of money thinking I am getting a SONY quality and it turned out it has a major problem that all notebooks of sony have. It overheats very fast and finally the hard drive died and even after buying a new hard drive the problem persisted. SO for those who are lucky enough to check this DO NOt buy this product. I am sad :(
1,Defective Hard Drive,"I purchased this computer in July, and on December 5th the hard drive broke. It will not mount and makes grinding and clattering noises. I have lost data. This is not a quality product. I am now returning it to Sony (event#E26545346). I thought Sony made quality products and I paid a premium for their notebook compared to other notebooks and look at what I get. I am very unhappy. I wonder if this is more than just an isolated incident. I will never buy a Sony product again and do everything I can to stop others from buying Sony's products.So if you like your hard drive unexpectingly crashing and like to lose data then go ahead and roll the dice and buy this computer."
3,"Horrible Display Glare, SLOW CD","Oh the display is so bright especially when it REFLECTS glare from sunlight and interior lights so much compared to other displays. It will also be hard to keep the screen clean because of the glossy surface. I Have 3 words to say about the display GLARE,GlARE and Glare. Its like those projection TV's with shiny plastic screens. But it does work in dim rooms good. Also copying cd's to the harddrive is HIDEOUSLY SLOW!!!. In fact, I had trouble reading homemade CD's that were easily read on other computers. I ended up having to use an IOMEGA external USB cdburner/writer to copy those cd's onto my vaio. Im not sure if its the harddrive or the CD player, but my desktop computer is so much faster in copying files. everything else seems to be ok though. I wish the touchpad was bigger like in competing brands. This is a low-end Sony, it compares to the compaqs and toshibas that go for 900-1100 dollars. You pay a premium to have the name Sony on the computer."
2,Not all bad but wouldnt buy again,"-My battery died within 6 mos-The internal wireless card went bad after about 2 yrs. Unfortunately it also causes Windows to crash if I even switch it on. Luckily it doesnt bother Linux.-The HDD has just died at a little under 3 yrs.These failures are common in laptops that travel often and used roughly. However I used this as a desktop comp with very little travelling.OTH I very much like the LCD. And I will be upgrading the memory and the HDD to extend its life, as well as pull the wlan and upgrade cooling as it always ran hot."
4,Rough edges,"The set arrived in about 4 days, which was very fast. The material is of high quality 18/10, heavy weight, continental size(which means larger than the standard place settings), and quite a nice polish. The problem I have is the side edges have a rough finish, almost like they forgot to buff out the square edges. Other than the serving pieces, all the forks and spoons have this rough edge, which does not match the high quality of the set. I don't know if this is the Riveria style, but I highly doubt it. I compared it to the pieces from Oneida at LNT, as well as the 2 styles from Costco, and they have nice rounded edges, unlike these. I don't know if others notice this, or I just received a bad set. I'm returning these for exchange or refund."
1,Downhill. Didn't think they ment that literally.,"I played this game for a few minutes. It seemed fun but you will quickly realize why it is being sold for around $30 (outside of retailers). Each race is about 1-2 minutes long which doesn't give much time to actually have fun.Customizing your character consists of changing outfits and colors, not stats (speed, jump, balance, etc). This game honestly felt like a minigame. Perhaps fun for a little bit, but there is no real immersion into the game. All you do is race, unlock locations and race some more.I would have given this game another star or 2 if the steering wasn't so harsh and if doing tricks was more than mashing buttons. To craigslist this goes..."
4,Awesome game,"Awesome game though the levels could have been a bit more difficult. But overall, very exciting, very enjoyable."
4,"Really fun for the first hours, gets annoying after that",This is a really fun game I loved it. I played it for a while but then I got bored. The gameplay is repeative. Same maps. Nothing new. You just keep skating and skating... Might be fun for a while.Multiplayer mode is great. Up to 4 people can play at once and have fun.
5,awesome fun,Bought this for my 8 year old. He loves it and so does his dad. It's lots of fun and not too difficult to get the hang of. I love that it doesn't require extra accessories. Great game for the price. Fun for all.
4,My 4 & 6 year old love it!,"We did research on this game, and found many ""professional"" gamers dislike for the simplicity. Let me tell you that for $[...] this game is a steal. My two boys play it all the time, and jump around while steering their skateboard, and trying tricks that no human could ever pull off or survive from. Some of the background music choices aren't my favorites by any stretch of the imagination, but if you can get over that then this game is great for young gamers. Toys R Us was selling this game for $[...] this past fall."
5,Cosmic Dub,"Quality sounds! This is one of my, and many of my friends favourite album. A classic. Turn up the bass!"
5,cosmic dub!,Quality! The album title sounds pretty spot on to me. This is a classic and a favourite.
5,Clear and well written,"A fantastic book on a topic one easily neglects. The book is very clear written, enjoyable to read and re-read (a must), and devided into 4 parts: Before the Presentation, Beginning your Presentation, The Body of your Presentation, Closing your presentation. Tony Jeary succeeded in packing tons of useful information in that little book. A great book for the serious presenter!"
5,Dangerous depths,Love this series. Please keep them coming!!! Love these especially since I am on a rescue dive team in Nebraska!!!!!
1,Region B,I waited 2 months for this Blu Ray. Finally received it and tried to play it. It did not work because I was sent a region B dvd that will not play on dvd players in North America. Thanks for making me wait and sending a dvd that I can't watch.
2,Bill Connolly's Rote 66 Blu Ray DVD,I tried it on 5 Blu Ray players and it did not work (both discs).There was sound but no picture.I returned it to Amazon.com. This came from an independant supplierthrough Amazon.
3,basic fun comes full circle,"Gave this, along with a microscope and slides to my sweetheart's grandkids. Their imaginations got a jumpstart and ran wild with ideas and unbridled excitement."
4,#1,"This album from yellowman is a must have.""Yello the Best"" is a great song.This album is worth listening too and production is great.Lots of new material.GET THIS.GET THis ALBUM if you know whats good for you wont be sorry"
2,You'd think it was built to be INSIDE!,"Very nice out of the box. Put it up last season, it went through one winter (I'm in Michigan) and now its faded and the shingles are falling off. You'd think it was built to be INSIDE!"
3,A bold though flawed attempt,"Huband's book is essentially three very different ones on the same subject put together in one jacket. And it ultimately fails to win top marks due to this. Part one , based on his experiences is interesting and gives good eyewitness accounts of events behind rebel lines in 1990. However for those who followed newpaper reports closely at the time [and who like me have files full of Huband's articles] there's little new. Part two, his dogged investigation of the events leading to the war is excellent and I just wonder why the whole book wasn't written in this analytical style. The final part fails to inspire as it is based on the author's attempt to discuss the later events of civil war in the six years that followed the events he witnessed in 1990. A bold, though flawed attempt to explain the 1989-1996 civil war in Liberia. Huband's book should more realistically have been titled ''Liberia: 1990, the start of an African war''."
3,Nelson Mandela's fight for freedom,"I read this book in seventh grade. For me it was a saddening story of one man's fight for freedom from Communist South Africa. He was jailed for treason on June 13, 1964. Finally in 1990 he was freed from prison, he was no longer South Africa's silent voice of protest."
3,Too small...,It is a nice camera case and the delivery was very quick and efficient but it ended up not fitting my camera. I have a Pentax Optio S45 and the case was way too small which is a bummer. So just know that it doesn't fit all S series cameras.
5,Bull Bar On An 03 Explorer,"It was waaaaaaaaay easy to install on my explorer, only took about 30 minutes to install, and it looks great!!"
5,"""Planet Earth""!","The Planet Earth soundtrack is one of the largest I own, (and I have about 15 including some other documentary soundtracks) and even then they couldn't fit every bit of music onto two discs! This is an amazing soundtrack and it really helped support the incredible visuals from the series.George Fenton is definitely one of the best documentary composers around. Along with Life in the Freezer and The Blue Planet, this is some of his best work, highly recommended!"
4,Old School Hard SF,Its 'Future History' with a big emphasis on *future*. This is very much like Niven but the ideas are actually even larger and more in depth. If you want SF that your mind can chew on read this book....
2,"Outside is fine, but torn pages inside","This review is purely on the condition of the (new) book received. About 10 pages have been bent inward and torn upon receiving the book. Somehow, the outside of the book is in pretty good condition, although not what you would expect from a brand new book. However, the condition of the pages inside (which can clearly be seen as torn and bent from the outside) makes me wonder if the book was in such poor condition prior to shipping. The other book packaged with it was in mint condition."
5,great book,"Vacuum Diagrams is a really good science fiction anthology. It covers from the year 2100 to 5 million, in humanities struggle across the stars. A great way to get into Baxter (I also suggest Evolution by Baxter for the same reason)"
3,Hard Science Fiction,"Not being a great writer myself I will let others do the plot summaries and simply state my opinion of the book.I consider Baxter one of the core group of hard science fiction writers however reading his books often feels too much like work...unlike Banks or Reynolds. Maybe its too much exposition on physics and too little character development. The balance between the two is off.All in all, a so so book."
3,possibly?,"This novel is long, and it does get dry at some times, but some of the stories are remotely interesting. I liked parts of the book, (it's made of 23 short stories SB wrote and published in magazines.) but the characters were constantly being throw out, leaving you wondering: why? Overall, I use this book as a guide of what NOT to do to a character in a novel, but it also gives you an okay, and somewhat comprehensive idea of what quantum physics are about. Read Hawking's ""Brief History of Time"" for clarification on some points. I just don't understand what some stories had to do with the novel."
2,Dull and quite heavy !,"When I first read stephen baxter's book ""Time Ships"", I was very satisfied with it. It has grandiose theme and very intriguing. I expected the same when I bought this ""vacuum diagrams"". But it seems that the quality of this title is not on the same class with ""Time Ships"". Baxter is not good on characterization but technically he knows the science well. However, I can only browse half of this book since it is boring and dull, also the science description is long and heavy."
2,Dreadful,"I don't think I'm going to be able to finish this. Perhaps this is some new writing style but I find it tiresome and it makes me long for better use of my time. I've read earlier Baxter that was a lot better, these stories are rambling, incoherent, hallucinatory. There's a gee-whiz wowzo quality that makes me wonder if what I'm reading is intended to be made into a video game. If I had bought a physical book I would take it to a store and trade for some old Silverberg. Thumbs down."
3,A Somewhat Disapointing Read,"If you've read Baxter's other works in the Xeelee Sequence (Raft, Ring, Flux) this book is worth reading, if just to flesh out the universe (humans DID survive after the Xeelee left!). But be warned: several of the stories in this book are actually chapters in other books. And I find Baxter's ""hocus pocus"" approach to mathematics annoying. A stupid idea doesn't get better after several paragraphs about some principle of physics."
5,Poetic Genius,"This book is a poetic marvel, enormously inspiring and every word took my breath away. This book is truly for those who can appreciate exquisite poetry and respect the art of prose.....++ A MUST READ!"
2,Uh-uh,"I read these glowing reviews, I ordered the book as a gift,and upon reading it first, discovered it wasn't all that insightful or charming. You can do better."
4,"Samson-Paul Samson""Tomorrow or Yesterday""","I'm glad I bought this CD as it has fine Samson performance on the first CD. The second CD is mostly blues which is why I got it,and he plays well but it sounds a little like a bootleg at a small club. But since he has passed on it is a very good representation of a gifted and rocking artist."
5,"How LBJ Lost His Word, Way And Then Vietnam!","How could LBJ forget the blunders of a limited war established by the mistakes of Harry Truman in Korea in less than 12 years? The author outlines all of the questions that cannot be easily answered. How do you end a war once it started? How do you justify the costs in blood and money? And How do you define victory? The writer seems to say, Limited War is like Marriage, easy to get into and hard to exit. The book will enlighten every reader and all American politician responsible for foreign policy should read it. A Superb book for students, professors and men and women in power so it won't happen again."
2,Business MIS not ethics,"This text is highly reductionist. From the beginning his only concern is argue for protecting from monitary loss (he describes unethical behavior based on how much money you loose). In summary this is a book designed to develop a background for understanding why we have corporate security on IT/IS systems. The book really should be titled ""MIS and Corporate Security the Current Social Backdrop"".There is nothing real for the student to grab ahold of from an ethical stand point. Use this as source book for indentifying the current trends but don't expect it to cause your students to think."
2,It's Lasted 10 Years.,"I've had this Bible for about 10 years now. In the last two I haven't used it so much. Mine is very worn but it still has years left on it. It is a good beginner Bible, it was my first.Pros:Long Lasting. Like I said it's 10 years old and still in decent shape.Great for a new believer.Cons:Font is smallNIV translation is horrible. It is one of the most inaccurate translations.There are many other Bibles and translations out there that I would recommend. Personally I like the NASB translation bound in genuine leatherhttp://www.amazon.com/American-Standard-Ultrathin-Reference-Genuine/dp/1581350260/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pdT1_S_nC?ie=UTF8&colid;=2Z09DPQ0H0UK5&coliid;=I1E5FPXMZ517L6It is more expensive but it is bound with genuine leather and the translation is, in my opinion, the best."
4,Lisa Ono,"I have loved Lisa Ono's music for quite some time, and this is the first CD of hers that I have bought.Her voice has such a relaxing quality to it, and she's arranged her music really well. My favourite track (and basically the track I bought the CD for) is Beyond the Reef."
3,Buyer Beware Amazon's Tracklisting is messed up,"I've only purchased one song off this album, and its ok, there are better Romantic Saxophone albums that you could invest in. Just wanted to put out a quick warning to anyone who might be considering downloading from this album. Amazon has the correct tracklisting for this album, but all the tracks are mislabeled. For example I purchased ""One More Night"" and ended up ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"". I contacted them back in June about this problem, as of today 12/6/10 its still wrong."
3,"john , alone, and entertaining","Having been a long time fan, I am a bit disappointed with the CD, mostly because John is solo, which i did not know when i chose this, and he is alternating among fiddle, banjo, and guitar. While obviously a talent to be reckoned with, I have come to prefer his ensemble work. I was also rather disappointed with the rather minimal chatter and humor with the audience. On the upside, he is a rather amazing solo performer and some of his tunes change in character as a result."
4,Crossing My Fingers,I had this book for many years until recently when I loaned it to someone who lost it. So I had to re-purchase it. I like this book because it is very easy to find the items. It is not like other books that are either too generic aor repeat and contradict themselves. It is just for fun so don't get too wrapped up in the meanings. Unless they work! Knock wood!
4,A rare find,"I have to be up front and say that since historical fiction about early Georgia is so rare, I am heavily biased in favor of all books that deal with this subject. I can only think of three other books that are set in early Georgia: ""Rascal's Heaven"", ""A Lesser Form of Patriotism"",Rascals' HeavenA Lesser Form of Patriotismand ""The Hornet's Nest"". As a matter of fact, it this book very similar to ""The Hornet's Nest"" in style and content. That said, ""Reap the Whirlwind"" was a good book. Anyone who is interested in the American Revolution will find it interesting simply because it deals with the southern aspect of the conflict. This side is rarely encountered in historical fiction. Most works about the Revolution tend to be centered around the New England and Middle Colonies."

1,Ignorant scoundrel of an author,"This book is simply one of Tulbure's cars for getting more money. He has left a wide wake across the Internet in mercilessly spamming both his books and his websites.Then he drops them like a watermelon and leaves the members with the bag.His books are sophomoric at best. His doctorate and educational credentials are a figment of his imagination, and HE CREATED HIS OWN FOLLOWING! People think Amazon members adore him, but his testimonials were by him, and his fans were him with out screen names.I've tried asking him what his credentials are on his various websites, and all that comes of it is a banning. He simply can't stand by what he says.I recommend that before you even THINK about buying this book that you do a Google search for ""Solomon Tulbure"" and press the ""I'm feeling lucky"" button. A plethora of information about this internet fraud can be found there.Be wary."
5,Classic Crime Noir!,"Mr. Buronson & Mr. Ikegami weave a powerful story that rivals Director John Woo's ""A Better Tomorrow"". The story is gritty and the action is in your face.Once you flip the first page, you cannot put the book down. This is what a true graphic novel should be."
3,"If you like first, buy all five; * * * and a half stars !!!","This is another crime/noir manga limited series, published as five books story in English.CONTRA:Lot of violence, lot of unnecesary bizzare stuff, not for children.PRONot AS violent as Crying Freeman :) Good ink work. Story evolves into something more than gang wars/vendetta stuff. Series is neither too short nor too long.C'mon, get all 5 books!"
1,I love Celine but don't waste your money on this cd,"I must say that Celine is amazing and too many people make fun of her or say ""Oh I hate her music."" They evidently haven't listined to her newest work. Well, that said, I would recommend you don't buy this single because you already have two versions on the original CD and the Christian B version is really no different. I was sorely disappointed because I thought I was leaving the store with a dance remix (after I heard it in a dance club in San Diego).Not the case - I guess we'll have to wait for this."
2,Not enough energy for a pivotable time in Russian History,"Mr. Brown takes the reader on a ride through a intense period of time, the 1917 Russian revolution. Even though Brown brings the key people to light (Lenin, Trotsky, Kerensky, etc.) he doesn't present the material in a fashion that keeps the reader wanting to read."
2,not what I hoped,"I purchased these earrings to wear out to dinner a year ago but unfortunately have only worn them once. The first stone was much bigger than I expected, and instead of looking classy they look cheesy and fake."
4,Sourcebook for a generation of Space enthusiasts,"Written in the 1970s, this book details O'Neill's vision of space colonies - huge space stations built from lunar material, selling solar power beamed to earth. Although his timetable of such colonies by the 1990s turned out to be too optimistic, this book is very much worth a look, both for historical reasons, and also to see what will happen once the price of access to space drops.Packed with technical detail, O'Neill's plan is based on two assumptions - that the price of access to space would drop, and that the price of energy would rise. Neither came true in the early 1980s. The Space Shuttle did not make space flight cheap as promised, and low energy costs did not make space based solar power economical. In the near future though the space frontier may very well develop just as he foresaw."
4,"Not Thrilling, but Fascinating","This book paints a fascinating and telling picture of the future of mankind as the author sees it. In explaining how humans will consume the Earth and eventually spread out into space, he also provides compelling evidence for Fermi's paradox: If alien civilizations exist, where are they? I recommend this book for those who are interested in the potential course of human civilization, especially those wondering where overpopulation is going to drive technology."
5,Great artistic film,"This film is the first thriller made in Mexico. The photography, the music, and the acting are excellent. Very sophisticated and somewhat disturbing. The story is good. The script is based on a research made by the director Daniel Gruener on witchcraft and old supernatural beliefs in Latin America. Even though the subject (witchcraft) is kind of unbelievable, the script was well written. The end of the movie is great."
4,Interested NM reader,"Wow! This author literally hits you over the head with a whole book of inconsistencies contained in the four gospels of the New Testament. This book is not for those who believe the Bible is ""The Word of God."" In fact, practically on every page there's some statement to disprove that assertion. I personally think he may have been obsessed with the need to ""shake up"" the die-hard Fundamentalists who truly believe the Bible is literally ""The Word of God."" (Of course, I don't think such readers would get much beyond the first few pages without throwing the book in the trash!) In my view, the author is a little repetitious of his main themes; but the book was sure an eye-opener for me."
5,Never not fascinating,"Chris Maybach's documentaries are the most intimate studies of artists I have come across. Whether or not the artists he examines are to your taste, his calm approach to each profile tells you a lot about the artist's work and intentions, his or her personality and ambitions. For the curious there are insights into the artists' lifestyle. Yet as gentle as Maybach's touch seems to me, I don't get the feeling that he's trying to steer me toward a favorable opinion of his subjects. This approach is perfectly suited to the artist Richard Tuttle, who, like his work or not, is the real thing. The making of art is a mysterious process as varied as humanity, and the impulses that drive artists are largely ineffable. This superbly crafted documentary helps us get as close to the answers as we are likely to get when dealing with such a singular and challenging body of work like Tuttle's."
1,And!?!? So!?!?,"If you like Pollack, Miro, and other abstract artists, you may like this. If you like learning about galleries and what motivates material artists generally, you may like this.However, many of us may think this art is a bunch of nothing. Many of us wonder how artists who put a lot into their work go unrecognized but this stuff does.In the same way that a Paul Mooney documentary implied that you're a fuddy-duddy if you don't appreciate his jokes, this work implies that you can't appreciate high-culture art if you don't like his work.But really, I just didn't care for what he presented. It seemed like the Emperor's Clothes in so many ways.I did love that this is a documentary that had foreign language subtitles."
3,Informative but Dated,"This title by Wiersbe is very informative from a historical standpoint, but for preaching use it is dated. Being published in 1980, the volume is now over 25 years old. Still, Wiersbe provides brief biographies on great Christian leaders, and then gives samples of their messages. I personally enjoyed the biographies much more than I did the sermons.Following the biographies and sample sermons, he gives a very dated resource list of classic books for the preacher. He closes by focusing on Dwight L. Moody's theology and personal influences.This book is an easy read, especially if you skip the messages. It will provide much insight into the lives of great Christian figures, and be helpful in better understanding the last 300 years of Christian history."
4,Great for the price,"I got this Olivia 527V over a year ago and has performed flawlessly using a cable box for HD and an UP/DVD (with $3 HDMI cable from Amazon) that will play just about anything, including videos from a zip drive. As others have reported, the setup is confusing, even if some guy or gal got an award for the novel spinning choices icons. When I turned in my cable box I needed help and the first ""help line"" gal I got in some Spanish-speaking country had the wrong script. The second gal, Pam, walked me right through it and I now get my below-99 channels because this unit has a built in tuner with QAM. When the kitchen unit goes, I will buy another 527V."
1,WARRNING,"Don't buy a Syntax Olevia! I bought one and it died almost to the day the warranty went out. Customer service said I would have to pay to ship it back and pay the parts and labor to fix it and that would cost over half of the TV's cost. They wouldn't offer to help with anything and they said they lost my registration card, the same one they used to call me with to ask me how I liked it a week after I bought the TV. So all I can do is to post this to every blog I can to try to inform others."
2,Look for a different HDTV!,I purchased this HDTV and it worked OK for the first 10 days. After that I was unable to power the tv on or off using the remote or manually. Read that other Olevia models had experienced the same or similar issues. Called Olevia customer services to complain and was put on hold for at least 20 minutes. Save your money or put it to better use....buy a different HDTV!!!
1,The paperback edition is almost unreadable,"The paperback book used print on demand technology and is so full or errors that it is nearly unreadable. In one case a footnote that is spread out over the bottom of three pages in the original book is presented as a continuation of the text on each page. As a result, on these pages you are first reading text, then footnote, then the continuation of the text, then the next part of the footnote, etc. If you are hoping to do a close reading of these essays, you will need to find another option."
4,George Upside Down,"George likes to do things upside down. Convincing George to conform to the right-side-up way of life is proving to be a bit of a challenge for George's parents, his teacher, school nurse and principal... Until they all decide to outsmart George by joining him in his upside-down antics. Using colorful cartoon-type drawings with humorously expressive eyes, McCarthy conveys both the fun of boyhood and a child's struggle toward individuality. Young readers are sure to identify with this topsy turvy tale!"
5,Praise for George,"I'm a teacher and a parent, and this book is a hit at school and at home. George Upside Down is certainly one of the best stories of 2003.My kids adore the bright pictures and humorous story. George is a wonderful book -- read right side up and even upside down as my kids have tried!"
5,A GREAT BUY!!!,"This is a very helpful, easy to understand, painless way to learn algebra! It is filled with helpful tips and examples. I highly recomend this book to anyone."
2,"Looks promising, but Kindle edition is riddled with errors","I received this as a gift, and unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a way to return a Kindle gift, or I would. On the surface, this looks like a wonderful tool for learning or brushing up on algebra, but DON'T GET THE CURRENT KINDLE VERSION! There are formatting errors that make several of the equations un-solvable. It looks as if the Kindle edition was formatted by someone who doesn't know algebra...symbols are missing, exponents are attached to the wrong variable...this sort of thing. As it is advertised, and indeed written as useful to beginners, this will likely lead to confusion and frustration."
5,Easy To Read & Understand,"My 12-year-old wanted to learn more about algebra. He is teaching himself by reading this book. The author clearly explains topics without a lot of confusing text. There are cartoons and illustrations in the book to break up the monotony. It's kind of like a workbook. Highly recommended. Wish there was a ""Painless Geometry."""
5,worth more than they charge,"Came across while shopping in the local grocery store and figured I would try it out. For less than 10 bucks, boy was I in for a surprise. I was at the time getting ready to take a college placement test again after having gained a low score the first time I had taken it. Got the book home and after four days of hard cramming with it I had raised my score by twenty points, more than I needed to pass the assessment test. This book is great for the simple fact that it does not assume you already know things like the ""order of operations"" and quadratic equations ""steps"", and it covers integers and exponents extremely well and leaves you with no fuzzy parts like some high priced ""self help"" math books that cost far more. Only downside to this book is that for older students is, it is a bit cheesy, but if a student can get over that they will have a lot to gain and almost nothing to lose."
4,Good introduction or review of basic algebra.,"I have been using this book with my 7th grader as an introduction to algebra. He has been able to follow the material. The explanations are clear and the exercises correspond well with the lessons. It covers a good variety of basic algebra topics, and I would recommend it for anyone needing an introduction to algebra concepts, or for anyone needing a quick review of algebra I."
1,Mistakes And Not-So-Painless Problems,"I would like this book a lot more, except: There are mistakes. For example, when asked to graph the coordinate (-4, -2), you go to -4 on the x axis first, then down to -2 on the y axis. She had it backwards. If you don't know what you're doing, and you're taught incorrectly, how are you to learn?Also, she will present simple information and then give some difficult, and I dare say impossible, problems to solve. If I were learning multiplication, and the teacher threw in fractions, integers, and other things I hadn't learned, I would, of course, get lost. Then my confidence would suffer.I'm gleaning what I can from this book, but there must be far better ones out there. I don't recommend this."
4,Good refresher,"This book is a good refresher, much like Cliff Notes. It could be a bit more explanatory in areas, but overall it is a great book to thumb through for the basics."
2,test problems not covered in tutorial part of lesson.,"I've encountered problems with this book, a lot of the types test problems at the end of each lesson are much more complicated than the problems given as examples in the tutorial part of the lesson, and I'm having a difficult time trying to figure out the correct answer or how the creator of the book came to the answer given to some of the problems at the end of the chapter."
2,1st diagram I saw was incorrect,"I am homeschooling my son, so I bought this book as a way to make Algebra easier for him. He's only in third grade, so I don't need it yet. However, I was explaining something to him regarding a calculation and wanted to see how the book would describe it. I thumbed thru the book and the first diagram I saw was on page 31. It was of the different number systems. It incorrectly showed that irrational numbers are a subset of rational numbers. I was a math major in college and know otherwise. Also, the book describes it otherwise. Because of this - the first thing I saw, now I'm questioning the whole series. Sad."
1,BAD AFTER SALES SERVICE,"I bought the AL2021MS in March 2006 and in November 2006 it started to malfunction (kept turning itself off). I called Acer support as it was still on Guarantee and was told they would replace it in 2 days. 3 days later I called them again and was abused by their help desk, told I had got it all wrong and that it would take 2-3 weeks. I am still waiting for a replacement screen. Apparently they are out of stock if it breaks under guarantee but will sell you a new one as they have enough stock to make a sale!How did I write this review: I am using my old 1999 15inch DELL monitor that still works.IF YOU WANT REALLY BAD AFTER SALES SERVICE AND A LCD SCREEN THAT ONLY WORKS FOR 6 MONTHS BUY ACER!!!!!"
1,Marxists Participating in Capitalism,"Neither the author, nor evidently the publisher, are in favor of free market Capitalism.In fact, both parties are communists who are against Capitalism, which they deem to be one with imperialism.Hence, the publisher should refrain from participating in the benefits of our system, which they are doing by selling this book for money.As communists, they should give the book away free, correct?Moreover, why all the restrictions on how to read the Kindle text?"
4,excellent and a half,"This is an album I simply let sit in the piles around the house way to long. I have been keeping myself far underprivileged by not listening to enough Larry CoryellIf you find yourself in the same situation, Restful Mind would be a great first step to a fix. Coryell plays acoustic guitar here to tabla, bass and a second axe.He is an amazing player: rocketing speed, amazing fluidity, and a rich, whole tone. Overall the album creates an organic, even-tempered nuance, but you'll never mistake a restful mind for passive fingers when master Coryell fires up on his six string.This is a fantastic album I am glad I finally got to play.As for a restful mind, I am still looking on Amazon, and everywhere else, for one of those. Have one to spare? I'll give you $100 bucks"
4,Fascinating narration,"I have tried many books in the past to learn about the military aspects of the german invasion of france in 1940. I wanted to read about the fall of Eben Emael, the tactics Guderian employed to cross Meuse, how Rommel crossed Dinant, the role of Luftwaffe etc.etc. I must say that ONLY THIS BOOK covers all of the above in a very engrossing style.I also loved the excerpts (from the then newspaper headlines) at the start of each chapter. I also liked the quotes that the author uses to make us see things in perspective (eg., when talking about General Maurice Gamelin's preference to experience over technology, the author quotes Fredrick the great - ""Experience is useless unless the right conclusions are drawn from it"" !!)I strongly recommend to all lovers of WW2 books. If you have read Stephen Ambrose & Cornelius Ryan, you also want to read Alistair Horne!"
5,France 1940- Germany's Greatest Triumph,"Alastair Horne's book ""To Lose a Battle: France 1940"" is a wonderful work of military history that details the German boldness and Allied incompetence that led to the Third Reich's greatest military victory of the war. Horne portrays the Allied generals as bickering and indecisive, jealous of command authority yet unwilling to take responsibility for their actions. By contrast the Germans, outmanned and outgunned, and using clever military propaganda, overwhelmed the French, British, and Belgium forces by a shock and awe campaign that was more bluster than blitzkrieg. Horne's condemnation is well taken- if only the Allies had planned better, been more open to improvisation, had a more clearly detailed command structure, and had they not given in to the overstated myth of German military might, they could have repulsed the Wehrmacht handily. This is a great book that reads like a novel. I highly recommend it."
5,A fine one-volume history of the 1940 Battle of France,"This is a fine one-volume history of the Battle of France. It covers both the military and political aspects of the campaign and illuminates, in detail, the reasons for France's abject failure to halt the Germans: political corruption, an ossification in thinking at the highrst military levels and the strife between France's socialist working classes and the very wealthy."
5,Everything about the Fall of the Third Republic,Alistair Horne does an extremely good job telling the collaspe of the third republic. He gives many stories and examples to support what went on. The book covers most everything you would want to know on the battle of France...
5,ECCO Men's Yucatan Sandals - Excellent!,"Most comfortable shoes I have ever owned. I wear them in 40 degree weather (yeah, its cold, but I love these sandals). They combine the comfort that the hippies needed for their free love and chemical highs at woodstock with the security that the roman soldiers needed to go into battle. Comfort and security."
3,Not for wide feet,"I'm disappointed that Yucatan doesn't seem to offer wider variants of their sandals (on Amazon anyway). I was forced to order the 13-13.5 M even though my size is 13 W. As a result, I get a slight discomfort at my arch. I also expected these to be a lot more comfortable. Don't get me wrong they are comfortable, but not in a spectacular way. For the price, I thought I'd be walking on clouds.Overall these are really nice sandals, but you're paying for looks not comfort."
5,excellent,"excellent,... i love it,....thanks,..ecco its the best!!!!!! muy buenas son super comodas,..para mi son las mejores,..vale la pena invertir en estas sandalias,..."
4,Front should be adjustable,"The sandals are comfortable but I have wide feet and from the picture, I thought the velcro tabs were adjustable front and rear. Well, the front tab apparently is for looks only and is not adjustable, so the front is very tight on my foot. Otherwise, good looking and comfortable."
5,Another great Ecco product,"I own a quite a few of Ecco shoes and these sandals are probably the most comfortable pair of Ecco footwear I've tried on. But you may want to consider ordering a size up. I normally wear an 11 1/2 but when they arrived, my toes were almost at the edge and when I walk, they slide past the top. I ordered the 46's and will return the 45's. Overall wonderful comfort. There's no stitching or rough spots that rub against your feet. Great cushioning too. Buy these with confidence! But don't forget if you wear an 11 1/2, go with a 46. If you wear an 11, go with the 45 (and so on)."
5,What a difference!!,"I've been wearing a pair of Timberland sandals for years and have been very pleased with them. They were beginning to look pretty shabby and I decided to replace them. I mostly buy Ecco shoes because they're so comfortable and decided to give their sandals a try. I wasn't prepared for how comfortable these Ecco sandals are.If my Timberlands still looked good, I would have been perfectly happy wearing them for years to come. Now I'm actually glad they wore out because the Ecco sandals are in a class by themselves! You won't believe how comfortable a pair of sandals can be until you try on a pair of these.It's been mentioned several times here that they're expensive. Granted, they are, but as the old saying goes; 'you get what you pay for, and that has never had as much meaning to me as it did when I bought these sandals."
4,Best Purchase,"Both my husband and I now own a pair of Ecco sandals and we love them. There is only one problem we have found, it is with the velcro straps. They lose their tightness after a while. I wear my sandals everyday so they are put to the test and after one year of continuous wear I need to have the velcro replaced. Other than that, these are the best shoe purchase I have ever made!"
3,Not perfect,"Left sandal fine. Right sandal has bumps and causes some pain in my arch. However, I did decide to keep them."
5,Best sandal I've ever found,"I have been wearing sandals since the '60s and just bought a pair of these ECCO Yucatan sandals after seeing them on display (but none left in my size) at REI in Seattle. Finally found a pair on Amazon via another seller and they arrived today. Absolutely the most comfortable sandal I have ever had on my feet. The straps fit perfectly. They are tight, have good arch support and conform to the shape of your feet. The length (44/10-1/2 US) is perfect. Stitching and quality are first-rate. Mine are brown leather with heavy-duty hiking soles. The leather is soft and pliable. In short, they are the best sandals I have ever bought. These days if you find a shoe you that you like you better buy two pair as they will surely disappear before you can blink. I immediately ordered another pair which I will store for use when these eventually wear out. Wish I had found them five years ago."
5,Awsome,Whent camping with famley at Baxter State Park in Maine. Hiked some trailes in the area with my 8 month daughter on my back my feet never botherd me once. Sandals are awsome will buy them again when have to.
2,Who decided to make this a movie?,"A lumbering read, alot of talk about the ground. Three characters, one is monosybolic, one is TOTALLY commited and the first person account whines all the time. He wants to hook-up with his cousin. Hmmm. A read to say you have read it."
1,Not so great...,"This book was the equivalent of a 3D movie in the 1800's, meaning it had virtually no plot, but lots of visual effects. Jules Verne was exploring the scientific intrigue at the time, as science fiction became more popular. While some people like this kind of writing, I certainly didn't."
1,Not worth your money,"Last year, our science teacher had us read this book when we were studying the Earth's interior. I eagerly went out and bought it, only to find that it was a dissappointment. My favorite thing to do is read, and in my entire life, this is the only book my parents have had to make me read. It was detailed, which is usually good, but add too much detail as Verne did in this novel and you begin to lose interest while waiting for something to happen. I wouldnt reccomend this to anyone."
1,Horrible,I hate this book with a passion. I had to read it for an English class and I absolutely hated it.
5,Journey to the Centre of the Eart,"Great, classic books by the one and only Jules Verne. Wonderfuly story, and you can picture in your mind these amazing characters. Sit curled up in a nice, warm blanket (maybe by the fireplace) and prepare to be enthralled."
5,Perfect,This book is very interesting in many ways. It was exactly the book I needed. It is just a amazing book.
3,Better than all the movie versions,"This short book is one of the founding classics of science fiction literature. It details the story of a German scientist who comes across a map to a place that leads inside the Earth. He puts together a crew, and of they go to Iceland to find the volcano that serves as the entrance. From there, he and his crew journey into the Earth and encounter environments with their own plants, animals, geography and weather. They collect samples, evade dangers, and have hair-raising adventures. The group travels back to the Earth's surface, but lose much of the samples to prove their trip.The book moves along quite quickly, and has fewer dinosaurs and other animals than seen in the various movie versions. Instead, the book focuses more on the internal dynamics of the group, and how they react to their discoveries, and to each other. All in all, a book that is easily read in a couple of hours, and more worth the time than watching any of the movies."
4,Journey Into Your Imagination,"PLOT: Armed with ancient directions, courage, and intelligence a scientist, his nephew, and a hunter search for the center of the earth and adventure.POSITIVES: This is a masterpiece. I am a Jules Verne fan and this is one of his best works. It is full of danger, suspense, excitement, and passion. I read this to my children as they were growing up and the story stayed with us all through the years.PROBLEMS: It is of course dated. This book requires imagination. It is long (44 short chapters). I usually read a chapter each night to my kids on a book such as this. If I couldn't finish the book in a month the children got restless.PROPOSAL: Purchase an audio version. This is one book that I'd rather hear read than read myself."
4,Jules Verns greatest book,"Adventure, suspense, bravery, sea monsters, underground caverns, unbearable heat these are just a few of the wonderful subjects this book has to offer. The story begins when Professor Hardwigg finds a very old book with a piece of parchment in it. On the parchment was a form of writing in some secret code. When the Professor and his nephew, Harry, discovered its meaning they were both shocked to find out it was the instructions for a journey no man thought possible, the journey to the center of the earth! Almost immediately they went on the journey picking up a man by the name of Hans to be there guide. There were many hard times in this adventure. For example, the Professor thought that they would find water in an abundance only to find that there was none till Hans made the discovery by drilling through a wall. Who knows how they will ever survive. I would give this book a very strong four out of five stars because of its ability to keep you wondering what is next."
5,Awesome Adventure in Awesome Condition!,Had been looking for this edition of this book for years! So glad to find it in such great shape! Look forward to making it my own!
2,Joe's book review,"I did not like this book. I do not suggest this book to anyone who mostly likes action books instead of logical books. The book was about a professor, and he was very a very logical person. The writer went into way too much detail and took many chapters for them to even begin the adventure. This book is for people who like geographical science, not the movie."
2,Bad Translation,"After reading about half a dozen chapters I had to give it up because this translation just doesn't do Vern justice. This translation is more of a re-write, and sadly the translator can't write. Find a different version if you really want to read it.That being said, it's a great story and well worth the read if you can find the version by Penguin Books."
4,Nice Classic,"I had never read ""A Journey to the Center of the Earth"" before. I had seen several movies made from the book, but I liked using my imagination while reading. I really enjoyed reading this classic."
1,Amazing book badly translated,"This is a wonderful book by Jules Verne but this is just a terrible translation. Just read the first page of the preview and you will see. e.g. ""Our good Martha could not but think she was very much behind-hand with the dinner"" Is that even English? Seek out William Butcher's wonderful translation of this great story by Verne."
1,"Not the same book as the original ""Journey to the Centre of the Earth.""","This is some sort of re-write, perhaps for American audiences? It's not nearly as good writing as the original. Get the original for free at [...]. The version I am reading was published in 1906."
3,Not my favorite,"Plenty of dull moments and a real sleeper compared to 20,000 leagues under the sea. Still a classic I suppose."
3,Enjoyable but a tad less than I expected,I have never read the hard cover version of Journey to the Center of the Earth. I have only seen the movie done a number of years ago by British actors so my review may be tainted. I very much enjoyed this Audio tape. Nimoy and deLancie are definately sci-fi favorites. I feel the portrail of Professor Lidenbrock was too harsh while at the same time the portrail of Axel was too weak. Professor Lidenbrock seem angry all the time rather than a curious scientist. Axel was afraid all the time and did nothing but wish to return to the surface. The music and sound effects added very much to the overall story and was done very well. I would recommend the audio cassette to anyone interested in a different format but don't expect something as riviting as a book or the movie. I will try other Alien Voice cassettes but hope others will be played out more interestingly.
3,A Sci-Fi Classic,"This classic is a decent to good read, although the science may be a bit out-dated (I am the master of understatement) and the modern reader might find the prose a bit dry. Still a good read for the avid reader."
2,"tedious story, poorly narrated","Yea, yea, I know this one is a ""classic"". But sheesh, it's just not a good story imho. So much of it spent in the bickering between the professor and his nephew, and the ""science"" part of the science fiction really seems to be missing in most places. And I just flat out didn't like the reader for the audiobook. I go through a lot of audiobooks, and I consider this to be one of the worst I've listened to."
1,ending was a dissapointment,"I'm a dissapointed ten year old rating this book. Up until the end itWas probably one of the best books I've ever read. It was full of adventure and excitement, but then I got to the end. The book did not live up to it's name. It would be more appropriately called ""Journey Almost to the Centre of the Earth. I recommend this book only to people who like major dissapointments."
4,books,"no much comments, classic fiction novel. help me understand more in my literature class but I do not remember where I put it now..."
4,Enjoyable,"Over the decades, I have read ""Journey ..."" a few times. Despite the years since it was written, it holds up quite well as a fantasy / Adventure! It is an enjoyable book and I think today's teenagers would like it."
5,"what raiders of the lost ark is to archaeology, this is to geology","This is a great adventure story that can be appreciated by kids and adults alike. While science fiction, it is admirably well-suited for inspiring an interest in the science of geology. I recommend this book to anyone who likes tales of adventure, iceland, or geology."
2,Is this really what you want!?,"One problem about ordering books on-line, is that you only have as much or as little imformation as the seller gives you. I was looking for a decent hard back copy of Journey to the Center of the Earth. This seemed to be what I was looking for. However, what the seller does not tell you, and something you can't see in the photo, is that this is a Barnes and Noble ""Children's Classic."" I don't think it is unreasonable to expect that this type of relevant information is included in the description. On top of it all, the particular seller I used listed the book as ""New"", which it clearly was not."
3,"Good, but not good enough","Journey to the centre of the earth is about a professor who's seemed to be gone mad, but with th help of his nephew Harry, and their guide Hans Bjelk, They actually make it to the centre of the earth. I gave it three stars because it doesn't really have an effect on me, I think it's a little bit to easy for my age, but overall it's a great story"
4,Excellent Entertainment...,"This is a wonderful book. Taking into consideration the timeat which it was written, it was (and still is) a very fascinating andintriguing book. It kept MY attention, that's for sure. Sure, maybe it IS outdated but you have to keep your mind open and remember WHEN it was written. About the only thing I didn't like was the super long descriptions of Iceland. Got a little snoozy but other than that, very excellently written. Good for anyone of any age!"
3,Very interesting storyline - dissapointing end!,"Unlike the other people who reviewed this book, I thought that the end was too prompt, and rather uninteresting. I thought they would reach the center of the earth, but they don't. The description of the underground lake is very interesting, however, the book is ruined by such a prompt end."
4,Book returned.; expect refund,"The book was an abreviated (DoverO edition. I did not know what a ""Dover"" edition was and had wanted the full versionof the book. I reurned the mailing and expect a refund. Conditional on the refund, I revise my rating."
5,Great adventure,"Excellent book. A bit slow moving at first but it quickly finds a good pace. It was so involving that I read the book in two sittings. The first part is like a travelogue and was very interesting. After giving great detail for most of the book, I didn't like the way it ended so quickly. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good adventure story."
4,Adventure With A Twist,"The book started out slow, and it dragged on at parts, especially during the trip to Iceland. But, all in all, this was a very exciting book that mixed sci-fi with adventure. I especially enjoyed Verne's image of the possibilities of a land inside the Earth with prehistoric animals and giant forests of mushrooms."
3,"Not the Best, But not the Worst","When I bought this game, I thought that it was going to be fantastic. Boy was I wrong. It was OK, but farely dissapointing. The graphics are awful, nothing is clear. In addition, the music is the same throughout the entire game, so it eventually becomes annoying. However, the game is action-packed. Penny Proud is trying to buy a T.H.A.N.G (super-machine) for her parents' anniversary, and has to do certain jobs to get enough money. So she cleans up the city, dances, cooks, waitresses, delivers pizzas, and does numerous other errands. Even though I wasn't bored for even one minute, everything seemed very pointless and I even put my Game Boy down to do more interesting things. Overall, this game was OK. It took me about 2-3 hours to finish and I wouldn't recommend it to people 13 and over. Younger kids would probably enjoy this game, but I found it hardly enjoyable."
1,Booooooring.,"A business that has been around for centuries, had their hands in everything, and even owned the Roman empire for a brief time period!!! It just doesn't get any better than that, this book could have been very, very exciting. Instead it is one of the slowest books I have ever read.When the ""action"" does begin in the last two chapters...you really don't care one way or the other, nor do you understand the majority of the problem, because it has been so poorly developed.Bought this book for $1 at the bargain bargain table at my local book store hoping for a gem. I figured it was just so cheap because it was by a British author and no Americans knew his work. Anyway, I was wrong...it was just $1 because it was incredibly boring.I don't reccommend this book...however, if you would like to read it...I've got one that I'll sell you for $1.50. :-)ukmatt78@aol.com"
2,Bland...check his other titles instead.,"Without simply regurgitating what other reviews have said, for me it basically comes down to this: the book was boring. Sure, there can be slow parts for pacing of a storyline but the ""slow part"" lasted through the first half or more.I REALLY like this author, but check the classic Wasp Factory or Song of Stone...those books are engaging and interesting."
2,Poorly executed & predictable,"Up until this book I had only read Iain Banks science fiction novels, and if it is representative of his mainstream fiction, I shall restrict myself to his science fiction in future.The story was predictable on both the small and large scale. For the most part the characters were unintersting stereotypes, with the exception of the main character and her eventual partner.Little effort was made to establish The Business as a believable entity, and the story relied on almost-but-not-quite incompetance on behalf of the bad guys. The author seemed to be trying to create the flamboyance and power of The Culture (from his sci-fi novels), but writ small. It did not work.On the positive...it was not badly written, more than anything just disappointing since I have come to expect a lot more from Mr. Banks."
3,Not bad... Could be a lot better...,"The Business is not a bad book but it is does not have what I've come to expect from a Banks novel. I am actually a reader of books written by ""M."" Banks (i.e. a Culture fan). This book is the third non-scifi novel I've read from Banks, the others being a Song of Stone and Complicity.The backdrop for this novel, involving a discreet outfit of businesspeople with a long history deciding to buy a small nation in order to have a corporate HQ and other fringe benefits such as a seat in the UN and diplomatic passports, sounded pretty interesting. The fact that it was Banks telling the story had the promise of fine woven details and a mind boggling plot.The nice touches are there but the main plot was, well, straightforward. In the presence of masterpieces like Use of Weapons, Feersum Endjinn and Complicity, the plot in this book doesn't do justice neither to the reputation of the author nor to the potential of the subject."
2,Disappointing.,I am an avid fan of all of Iain Banks' work but this book I found to be a big letdown. At times I had to force myself to keep reading because unfortunately the plot wasn't enough to retain my interest for the duration. The only reason I read it in it's entirety was because Iain Banks wrote it and I am too big a fan to give up. The base idea was fine but I got the impression that this was a book only in the draft stage ergo released before it's potential was reached.
1,slow and pointless,"I have to start by saying that I had to quit after about 300 pages. While ""literary"" fiction or science fiction can be slow paced plot-wise, this one just seemed slow without anything interesting to take up the time. I usually love big conversations between characters concerning social issues, but the conversations in this book lacked something. Maybe reality, I don't know exactly. Anyway, I've read lots of good reviews about other books by this author so I'll probably try him again at some point. Probably not for a while though."
3,Alright for Iain Banks,I thought this book was very well put together until the very end where it seems like the main character's personality seems to unravel and ceases to be strong as she appears to be in the majority of a book.
3,Well Written But Uninvolving,"'The Business' is an extremely well written novel, and I managed to get through it without too much of a problem. However I can't say I enjoyed it that much. It was a little too wordy for my liking and the central character, Kate Telman, was not altogether likeable.I think it would perhaps transfer to television as a mini-series more effectively than as a stand alone literary work."
3,Doin' ' The Business ',This is by no means his best writing however it's a much better book than it lets on to be and unlike a previous reviewer I rather liked the fact that we get hardly any insight into the mechinations of ' The Business .'Telman's character is believable and it's an interesting enough journey she takes us on albeit a little too superficial. Once again though Mr. Bank's can't quite capture the nuance and timber of North American dialogue in spite of his brilliant skills in so many other ways.
3,Disappointing and Feeble Plot,"Having worked in a major corporation all my life, I agree that there is a great deal of jostling and maneuvering, back-stabbing and downright silliness in many strategic plans, but I nevertheless found The Business novel to be a feeble and weak take on the realities behind the scenes. Kate's voice comes across as written by an author obviously making up for his lack of solid personal experience in the business world with an abundance of mundane cliches, boring personal involvements and buzzwords to be found in any business magazine. Any wit in the Business inevitably also takes on a contrived feeling. My suggestion to anyone looking for a book grounded in personal experience, sharp satire, wit and humor revealing the realities of life in high-tech corporations, is to turn to the skillfully written episodes in ""MANAGEMENT BY VICE"" instead....And you'll get a candid, worthwhile eye-opener that won't disappoint!"
2,The War of the Worlds,"I was somewhat let down when completing The War of the Worlds by H.G. Wells. The way Wells wrote in Old English, required me to often reread the text to fully understand the concept. Secondly, I was surprised how limited the number of fighting situations there were compared to action films that I've previously seen. Instead, there was a lot of hiding and survival situations. I think Well's writing style showed that he was very specific during the first few chapters as he described the setting and characters. However, Wells did not necessarily allow more of the characters to develop, thus decresing the interest of Wells's writing. In conclusion, I would only recommend this novel to a reader who enjoys Old English writing and has fun with Wells's style."
1,Not my favorite read,"Gee, I know its a ""classic"" but I could't wait to be done with this book. I was completely put-off and annoyed by the writers ""backwards"" description of events. Hard for me to describe here, but as events were unfolding, writer describes them after-the-fact... I dunno, just not to my liking I guess"
2,Under attack,"A Review by TrevorThis is a story of a reporter named Ogilvey. He shows up at a site were an alien aircraft landed on earth. The rest of the story is him trying to find his wife, while the aliens are trying to take over the earth. This story revolves around a radio broadcast.I would give this book a two star rating. The book just needs more to it! I fell asleep reading it once, because it was so boring. The characters were real sounding, but they didn't do anything exciting. I usually like science fiction books; I guess it was just to old for me. H.G. Wells used words you usually don't hear in our society anymore. You can see what is to come so easily in this book. It was hard to tell when the climax was because there weren't any real exciting parts. This book seems to drag on because you know what is coming. I would not suggest buying this book. If you really want to read it is your choice."
2,"Innovative, but very boring","There is no doubt that this book was ahead of its time when written.But I found it boring and painful to read. Very little character development. Instead of being emotionally drawn in, paragraph after paragraph was descriptions of silly Martians and their Heat-Guns.100 years later this book just doesn't do it anymore. We know that Martians don't exist and far more entertaining works of science fiction have been created."
1,Doesn't have vocab info in Kindle version,I picked up the kindle version when it was offered for free and it doesn't have the SAT words in bold with the definitions on the next page. I looked at the preview for the paperback version and the kindle version is not the same. I also could not find the footnotes.
1,Did not read so don't know,"Didn't read deleted shortly after downloading. Just wanted to try out a 'kindle' book on the iPad and the resolution is so awful I removed it and the kindle app promptly. They (kindle books) are no where near as nice, clean, crisp as iBooks :( Kindle books might be ok for some people that are ok reading fuzzy blurry words with terrible graphics, but I'm already spoiled on the brilliance and crisp clear resolution of the iBooks and Kindle books feel like your going back 10yrs in technology every time you look at one on the screen. If your an iPad owner, don't bother, if you want this book find it on iBooks."
5,The War of the Worlds,I needed this for a project in my daughters school. She is in the 7th grade and had no problems comprehending the material.
4,Wow....,"I first read this when I was 8 years old. Since that time I had seen the movie made in the 50's, listened to the Orson Wells radio broadcast, and saw Tom Cruise destroy the story in the moive remake. It was great to read the original again. I had forgotten it totally. Its a slow start.. but once it gets going, its a classic"
4,A Review:,"I found the War of the Worlds a difficult book to read. This is down to many things, not least my lack of experience with Science Fiction novels. That aside, this book is a story designed, at the time it was written, for a nation (England) that Wells believed was complacent in its own power and dominance. It is this complacency that helps the martians in their destruction of human kind, and also nature in its destruction of the martians. For me the greatest importance of the book is the irony in the fact that the martians are not defeated by humans, but by nature, something neither the martians or humans have control over. This twist to the story is what seperates it from other science fiction works, and this is why i rate it so highly."
5,"""Then came the night of the first falling star...""","When I first read this novel back in 1998 (A hundred years after the novel had been written), I was expecting a good horror novel. What I got was a powerful novel of faith and hope within the story of a Martian invasion. Mankind is powerless against these invaders, their weapons useless. But in the end, Mankind wins anyway, thanks to the Master of Heaven and Earth. H.G. Wells' novel is a masterpiece that deserves a place in everyone's collection of great science fiction! Grade: A+"
2,Reading with Tequila,"Sadly, I just couldn't get into The War of the Worlds. It dragged from word one. It was short and didn't take a long time to read, but it seemed like forever. I've been recently coming to appreciate some alien stories, but this one fell flat. The ending struck me as an easy way to end the novel and left me feeling unfulfilled."
5,H.G. Wells is the absolute master of science fiction!!!!,"If you want to read one of the most influential, exciting and pioneering masterpieces in the history of science fiction and literature read this! H.G Wells is incredible! Along with Jules Verne (who is also fantastic) he is considered the founding father of science fiction. Thats got to be saying something hasn't it? The book really gives you a sense of how humanity would react in a crisis like this and throws a feeling of panic, terror and helplessness at the reader. It is actually quite eerie when I lay in the garden and look up at the stars at night now. Are they really watching us......Look folks, just read it! I promise you wont regret it. Have fun!"
3,I prefer - - -,"- - - the Orson Wellles radio version, which scared the United States half to death. Just reading it on the page was pretty boring."
3,The war of the worlds,It was an interesting story to read. I enjoyed it although I normally wouldn't read something like this. The reason I read it was because it was for school.
5,Very successful,"Overrpriced! 6 CD set unabridged, narrated very successfully by Sean Barrett with his lovely English/Irish baritone voice, so very appropriate to this Wells' masterpiece."
4,A science fiction classic,"I don't care about the supposed disguised attacks on British imperialism that Wells portrayed in this book. I enjoyed this classic by what I think it is: a gripping narrative of an alien invasion, cleverly written, intelligent, fast-paced, without naming even the main characters!The other merit is that this book is the genesis of all ""invasion"" books that followed.A great read."
3,War of the Worlds,"I enjoyed reading this book. I have seen the movie, but very little of it is similar. It was way ahead of its time for science fiction."
4,Science Fiction Fun,"The War of the Worlds is the best of Wells' science fiction. Not only does it create a frightening vision of what might happen if an advanced society were to invade earth (though this ""vision"" was more political satire than anything and continues to have relevance in today's world), but it is well written (not true of all Wells' works) and contains very real human drama that by itself is an engaging story. Though it came alive on the big screen and I occassionally had a hard time picturing the Martians and some of the details of the story without seeing Spielberg's version, this is certainly worth reading for all science fiction fans or people who want a little background when they watch the film."
5,anthony and my book,this book is a compelling book and has alot of up and downs in i i like this book because it has a lot of action and there is always a good twist. also threre is a good moral in this book witch reminded me of the boy who cryed wolf. another reason i like this book is because it has alot of action in it there is not one time in this book that i didnt want to put this book down. i like how it has real world based setting but has a si fi plot that is one reason i gave this book a five star rating i loved this book so much and i know u will too
3,somehow the original classic disappoints..,"Most everyone knows of 'The War of the Worlds', a story which has been told, filmed, and adapted into various forms over the past century. Yet actually reading the original by H. G. Wells is a disappointing experience. Oh sure there is horror, some violence, and the author's imagination is quite nicely captured in his prose. But the entire story takes place in greater London, and is told as if the author has never lived more than 50 miles from the place ... and somehow he believes all his readers are as intimately familiar with greater London's nooks and crannies as he is. Thankfully, I am very familiar with London ... and so I found the destruction of all these neighborhoods to be quite intriguing. I think those not familiar with London might be bored with it all.Bottom line: while it certainly has its moments, 'The War of the Worlds' seems oddly myopic and simplistic. Missable."
4,"Still a good story - hard work, linguistically","One of the original science fiction masterpieces, and still a winnerThis book, however, is living proof that the English language evolves ..."
2,O.k but way to out dated,O.k this book was written at the begging 0f 1900's but it's wat to outdated. The characters are not fun to read they are very boring and not that much happends through out the whole book till the end. the ending is maybe the best part of the book becouse all the action happends. At times the book states some good questions like if there is life out there. the book was the first of it's kind which is why it's a classic.
1,This book is HORRIBLE,"I have recentely been assigned this novel as and English project in school. If this grade did not make up 25% of my quarterly grade...I would not be writing this review now. If you have not begun to read this book now, DO NOT...may I repeat, DO NOT read this wretched book. As for my star rating, I would have given this book half a star if this was an option on the review page. Ciao"
3,War of the Worlds,"War of the Worlds by H.G Wells takes you back in the last few years of the nineteenth century, when an ordinary day goes from good to bad. Aliens, with technology that man has never even dreamed of, come to earth and destroy everything and everyone. People try to fight back, but have very little success. The aliens want the human race as their slaves, which could destroy human life for ever.H.G Wells takes you into a book of excitement and makes you want to continue reading it to the end. I recommend War of the Worlds for anyone who likes a good action book with killing and explosions in it. This book is so believable that when the author read it over the radio in 1938 everybody thought it was real and that aliens were invading earth."
5,"Fantastic, terrifying, intelligent, thoughtful, REAL!","Not bad for 1892! A defining book, and in my top three faves. I first read this when I was twelve, and I have not been without a dog-eared copy since. The images it conjurs in the mind are terrifying, walking through the English countryside I often imagine those giant, pitiless war machines, striding over smashed artilery, burnt out houses, and men and horses suffocated by the unbeatable black smoke.I thought this book would be better received. I'm glad the book is not set in the US as although it is a great place to set a story in, we English need our own Apocalypse. The book is far from dull, and Well's narates it like a documentary, making you believe that it has actually happened. Do not hesitate, buy it. I cannot be sure that you will like it, but it is worth the risk for a book that could haunt your mind for the rest of your life. Uuulah!"
4,Purchased to test Kindle App,I recently installed the Kindle application on my Windows laptop and purchased a new Android phone. I purchased War of the Worlds to test the Kindle app on both devices. I have read the book before but have enjoyed reading it again with the Kindle application. I am hoping to buy a Kindle Fire in the near future and my experience reading the e-book version makes me more anxious to have a dedicated reader. The text is clear; the reading experience is enjoyable; and the book is just plain good. I highly recommend this book for anyone who has not read War of the Worlds or wants to re-read it on a mobile device.
5,Great Book,"Im 16 years old and had to pick a book to read for an independent reading for my english class. This book was one on the list so i thought id give it a try. for a book that was written in 1930 something, i thought it was excellent. easy read just not a lot of dialog. fast shipping from amazon too"
5,ggreat book,"Was looking for a version a little shorter for my son to read, and other versions were too long, so he felt discouraged. This was perfect!"
3,it is what it is...,"you either like it, or you don't... like most classics, the story's themes have been duplicated, so it reads like a cliche to the uninitiated... which kind of ruins the book for most"
5,"Still a classic, wonderful read","Pick this up, and you are transported back to late-Victorian England, where news from the Home Counties takes over a day to travel to London. And yet when those Martians leave their cylinders and march across the countryside, with their death ray and black smoke, it is terrifying, believable in details, and believable as an underlying vision of things to come. When we read this book now, we think two world wars and innumerable mass refugee situations (the scene of the brother's flight from London eastward is one of the best in the book)- none of which Wells' original readers could have had in their minds. As the author of the ""Introduction"" points out, every re-make uses a familiar contemporary setting, so that the fragility of our safe and familiar can be destroyed all the more vividly and violently."
5,Wells wrote one heck of a book,Wells wrote a great story that has been redone so many times now. It wasn't written in the 50's as many people might think. It was actually written in the 1890's. And Wells creates a story about Alien Invasion that is so scary and well put together. It has Martian's coming to corral the humans. And the humans at first have no way to beat them. They keep getting beat and it almost seems as if we are going to be killed at any moment only for the humans to come out on top. A great Victorian style novel that stands the test of time (a la Independence Day). Though this book is ten times better than Independence Day. A great sci-fi book that will forever be the blueprint for Alien Invasion novels or movies.
2,The World Full of Wars,This book is a mix of science fiction and drama.The author also plays the role of the main character.The action starts in the second chapter when a large cylinder falls from outer space.The narrator is an astronomer who happens to be in the right place at the right time.He watches the first cylinder fall and while he is inspecting it he discovers some sort of life.at this time the action begins.The narrator is basically stuck roaming to and fro trying to dodge the mysterious aliens.The story is very suspensful and at times difficult to follow.However I did enjoy reading it.
2,It was Okay.,"The book was okay if you like incredibly boring details. If he (the author) would have put in a little more action, it might be a 3 or 4 star book. Otherwise, it was okay, although a little farfetched."
2,The book wasn't too exciting but it was interesting,"I finished reading the book last week and to tell the truth, I was glad to be done with it. I didn't find the book appealing at all. It was boring and kind of graphic at some points. I recommend this book for people who are into the sci-fi type of books."
3,"H.G. Wells' ""The War of the Worlds""","This book was, at most, average. Some parts were boring, some were vividly described, and others were so trivial to me that I had no idea what was happening. I do respect the fact that it helped create the science-fiction genre."
2,overrated,i was really excited to read this book but ended up being really disappointed. i don't understand what everyone else sees in it. it wasn't very exciting at all and i really don't think h.g. wells was that great of a writer. it was really a pain to have to get through (so it was good that it's short) but was somewhat entertaining at times.
1,War of the Snores!!!!!,"Overall War of the Worlds by H.G. Wells, was a horrible book and unless your fasinated with old English, I recomend you do not touch the book. It is also extremely BORING and the one exiting part in the book lasts one page! There fore War of the Worlds by H.G. Wells is a good way to destroy a saturday afternoon or decimate your free time."
1,This book was Terrible,This book was the worst book i ever read I had read The Invisible Man and hated that also but I heard from people that H.G. Wells was a good author so i said i would give him another chance. What a waste of time. Both these books were terrible i would reccomend them to anyone they were the worst books i ever read and it was a waste of time
3,Wells' book a little too repetitive,"War of the Worlds by H. G. Wells was a good idea gone somewhat awry. Though the old English was part of the problem, the storyline became sort of monotonous in that it was always the same thing: the character would run, the Martians would happen to end up near him, and he would barely manage to escape alive. Though I found the ending to Wells' book well-thought-out, it did seem rather anticlimactic after witnessing the sheer power of the Martians. Although Wells' book is plot-driven, he does not really develop any of the characters in much detail at all. (It woould have helped if Wells had named the main character.) Altogether, Wells had a good thought when coming up with the book,the plan was, for the most part, lost in the writing."
2,Not enough action,I personally thought this book was horrible. It was very boring and not once was I on the edge of my seat. I was never excited to keep on reading. The only thing that I liked about this book was how H.G. Wells described the Martians. I think he did a very good job at that but besides that the book needs a lot more action that will keep you on the edge of your seat wanting to know what happens next.
1,Boring,I had to read it for IS AT practice and it was not good at all I chose the rating since it was boring
3,Men from outer space,"I actually had to put this down, and start reading another because it became very dull, lacking in both suspense, and awful verbiage - granted it has to do with late 18th century English. However, after I picked it up again, I loved it (it probably has to do with the artilleryman who came later in the book, and whose text I hated). Very interesting read, and thank goodness none of the Tom Cruise bs, rather it is about a solitary man on his own to survive. Overall, very enjoyable and a fast read."
4,Dover abridgement for children nicely done,"The Dover edition of HG Wells's 'The War of the Worlds' is offered in an abridged version that worked well with my first grade boy. At 76 pages in big type, it's probably one-third the length of the original. Each of the seven chapters is a short bedtime reading, though with Wells's compelling prose we often pressed on to the next chapter. It is a good introduction to science fiction in general and this classic story in particular."
5,War of the Worlds Review - Mrs.Beckett (Chin),"The story shows the martians as being monsters with no feelings for humans. They are stronger, smarter, and more aggressive. Humans are shown as weak and dumb. The author shows what happens to a crowd of humans under a lot of stress. They steal, run over each other, and help only themselves. Even the narrator cracks under pressure when he kills the curate. The overall tone is hopelessness eventhough hope is all man had. The martians destroy everything including man's hope. Even with man's small victories, the martians were winning the war. The end is very interesting. The narrator said it was the smallest living thing on Earth that had the power to kill off the martians. The martians had no plan to battle the bacteria. Man was just lucky to have won the war. The martians should have realized that Earth belongs to man and all living things on Earth."
3,Excellent,"HG Wells captivates the mind with this one of a kind Martian attack thriller. the reason for the deah of the martians is suprising but upon further retrospection somewhat boring and mundane. Regardless, excellent weekend reading!"
5,The best sci-fi,"This is no doubt the best science fiction book out there. If u like that genre, get it. Can't believe it's free."
5,love it,"A quick arrival, high quality buy, fantastic buy, would recommend to anyone. I will do buisness with these guys again."
4,A classic read!,"I've wanted to read this for years! This book is quite a classic, definitely worth taking the time to read."
1,Lacks plot!,"The author, H. C. Wells, takes one of the most interesting concepts and creates one of the most boring books imaginable. The book is short on worthwhile ideas. Yet, it exhibits an abundance of long, runaway sentences. I found myself hoping that H. C. Wells might, at some point in the story, start to exhibit some of the interesting flare of his later counterpart ... Orson Wells."
1,This book was O.K,This book didn't deserve five stars. This book was not exciting. It is not going to happen is real life what happened in the book. Nobody liked it in class.
1,it deserves one thumb up !,this book was okay but extended too long so it got boring at times. it should have been in the U.S. It should have considered making it in NewYork. Then it could have been more exiting. Then we could have understood it much better because most of the words were in british. It would have been a lot better. they should make a remake of it in a english background. they should also update the book.
3,Oh come on!,"Have you ever watched an old 1960's sci-fi movie with spaceships held up by strings and lame costumes? Well this is the book version. Granted, for it's time, I'm sure it was phenomenal. But to read it today is like watching some old claymation dinosaur movie.I loved Wells' ""The invisible man"", ""The Time Machine"" and ""The Island of Dr. Moreau."" Great books even today. But War of the Worlds just wasn't that good--I recommend reading the others. I gave it 3 stars just for it's classic value--it really was the beginning of books like that so I've got to give him credit."
2,The War of the Worlds,"The War of the Worlds is a science fiction novel and I didn't think it was very interesting. It is about a couple in London, England in the late 1900's. This couple was always interested in the stars and the sky, so when they saw red beams of light they got suspicious. So when people said that a flying suacer had crashed they were not suprised. The Martians started to invade the Earth as soon as the saucer landed. During the fighting this couple got split up. The main conflict is that he tries to fing his wife. I didn't like this book very much because there was not much action. The story would have been better if it was more exciting. I would recommend this book to 14 year olds and over, but more to kids who like science fiction."
2,The War of the World,"I was very dissapointed after reading the book, ""The War of the Worlds,"" and found that it did not meet my expectations considering all the publicity (other people's reviews). A lot of chapters were very repitive if the fact that half of the time the book just talked about him wandering around. In addition there were too many references to Old English towns that made the book extremely confusing. Also I couldn't tell if the main character's brother survived or where he went. I was also displeased by the fact that the main character was merely an observer to the martian's defeat and the fact that his only real accomplishment was just surviving and didn't do anything to stop the martians."
3,War of the Worlds,"I read War of the Worlds for my senior english class. This book was pretty much straight forward. There were no character names in this book. It had a basic storyline and focused on it in the enitre book. This is a decent book to read if your into science fiction. I personally did not like the book, however it was very well written . I thought it had a terrible ending but you will have to read it to find out for yourself."
4,War of the Worlds,"I went back and read this story again. I remembered reading it as a child and wanted to rehash the experience of hiding under my covers from the martians. Okay, that didn't happen, but I still enjoyed rereading this story. This book spawned a lot of science fiction books and movies. A must read for any science fiction fan."
5,H. G. Wells At His Best,"Personally, this is my second favourite novel by writer H. G. Wells, and one of my favourite books in general. His writing completely immerses you into the world of the protagonist. Then, when you think you know what's going on and you get comfortable, he flips it all upside down on you. It's a slow buildup and suddenly an exciting race to the end, an interesting and compelling read throughout."
3,Intriguing,"Great book to read, especially with all of the cultural significance following it. It is A must read for everyone."
4,Great Book,Very Classic Book and should be read before seeing the movie as it provides a totally unique story. HG Wells is the man.
5,Great read with a subtle message,Another book I had a hard time putting down. Great character development and an even better plot line. I think this book translate to all audiences even those potentially not interested in science fiction or the time period. the books real strength is in the characters and the story. You don't have to be into science fiction in order to truly enjoy this book. Plus is free.
5,The best WotW version,"With apologies to Orson Wells, George Pal and Steven Speilberg, the Classics Illustrated version of H.G. Wells' ""The War of the Worlds"" was, is, and ever will be the best visual version of this classic book. The artwork by Lou Cameron is simply superb and Harry Miller's written adaptation faithfully captures the book without sacraficing any of the action. Although some may consider the appearnce of the tripods to be a bit dated by today's standards (they resemble Cold War era tank turrets mounted on water tower legs with vacuum cleaner hoses for ""arms"") they still retain a menacing appearance within the context of the story. The story itself thankfully remains grounded in the late 19th century when Wells wrote it. A pity that Speilberg decided to ruin the story by making it about a dysfunctional 21st century family. The image on the cover of the tripods attacking a World War I era artillery crew is not just classic; it's poetic."
4,Examination of Nature,"H.G. Wells' science fiction novel War of the Worlds is an examination of nature as life and death. On page three, there is mention of the magazine ""Nature"" which demonstrates the theme of nature at the forefront of Wells' novel. In the end of the novel, a man throws his hands up to the sky and thanks God. However, God in Well's sense is nature itself. He puts the two as equivalents, something that is often overlooked. Nature is too often seen separate from God, lesser than God, but not in Well's story; here nature is God and God is nature. It is the microscopic allies of nature that protect us from the aliens in Wells' story. Wells writes, ""By a toll of a billion deaths, man has bought his birth rite of the earth."" (208) but Wells is warning us of this dominating human-centric view and letting us know that nature is still the one in control."
4,A classic,It's war of the worlds. It's legible. There are an array of nifty appendices in the back. What more could you want?
4,"Review for ""The War of the Worlds"" by Andrew Lovas","The novel ""The War of the Worlds,"" was an exciting book. It had a lot of suspense and was actually pretty esay to follow like many of H. G. Well's novels. It had a great background idea about it. When this novel was first written it was the first ever to express the idea that there was life somewhere else in the universe besides Earth. The aliens embrace themselves for war against the human race. They our much stronger and have a lot better technology than us. As the novel keeps going it gets more and more exciting for the simple fact that you will get worried about the future of mankind. I would recomend this to people that really enjoy reading science ficion novels and who have read a novel by H. G. Wellls before. It is a very old book but it is pretty entense throughout its duration. So if you get a chance to read it you should give it a try."
1,One good Book the one and only,Pretty good I also watched the movie the movie is pretty awesome love the movie so bad I want to watch it again
5,Read it in class and is amazing,"This book is wonderful! Truly a great book! I Love It! A must read , you will love it! Amazing!"
5,The visionary Wells,"I had, in my life, read most of Wells' works, but for some reason I had neglected ""The War of the Worlds"" in my reading. Now I have read it, and am very pleased. It is, in my opinion, the best of his novels; the best of the best. The man was a brilliant writer. He identifies and praises man's indomitable will to survive in the very worst of circumstances."
5,This is a great book,I liked this book mainly because it's science fiction. I liked the martions and the detail the writer used. I liked the interesting words used by the writer. It was illustrated well.
3,The War of the Worlds,"My opinion of the book ""The War of the Worlds"" by H.G. Wells is that for the most part, I enjoyed it. I enjoyed the story due to the fact that it had a sci-fi theme that could keep the reader involved in the story. Another attribute I noticed about the story was that H.G. Wells used very good vocabulary throughout the story but never used words that were too far out of context so the reader would be unable to understand the meaning. The only thing I did not enjoy about the book was the point of view. I wished the author would not have had the characters remember the story but actually be living in it. I believe that would have offered more action, suspense and intrigue. Overall, I give this book 6 out of 10 and recommend it to younger audiences that enjoy the sci-fi side of books."
3,a fourteen year old kid,I think that this book is ok. It could use a little more action than just people running and hiding. But still it was a good book. This book is a little slow at first but then it speeds up. I personally think that it could go a little faster at the beginning.
3,War of the Worlds Review,"While this book is a classic, I have to give it only three stars because as a teenager I found it very boring. The story line and plot were great, but I felt it dragged on too long in places and became extremely thick at times. The action was up and down, sometimes the book captivated me, sometimes it almost put me to sleep. However, I do believe this book captures what the human reaction would be if the events described in the book were to take place. I did not completely love this book, and i did not completely hate it. I think this book is just, simply o.k."
4,Book,This is a strong book that always keeps yo guessing and on the edge of your seat. I think that this author writes some nice pieces of written masterpiece! I will be buying more!
4,The Future of Earth is Coming to an end by Addie Roberts,This action packed book is exciting to all ages. Martians envade our Earth killing all kinds of plant and animal life. This book tells how Martians kill most of human life. It is a very good book and I think you should read it. This is a very good book if you like action.
3,Why I think The War of the Worlds is a Mediocre Book,"The War of the Worlds is a very confusing book. The author confused me with all the different terminology. After the begining of the book H.G. Wells goes into to much detail. The plot is good, but the climax is extremly predictable. If you like a cornucopia of details, you will love this book, but if you don't you will dispise it."
5,Excellent companion for field visits,I have found this to be an excellent resource for finding sites of interest and a faithfull companion for exploring the site once I have arrived. The information provides a nice addition to any anasazi library
1,This batch was bad,I had ordered this previously for my daughter who absolutely loved it. The next time I ordered it it was off flavored and tangy. My daughter wouldn't eat it and I donated it to the food bank
3,Flimsy,I know it didn't cost much but it is very flimsy even though the picture makes it look like it stands straight up for you without any assistance of being stuffed.
3,Not the best of this series.,"This book is not up to the standards of the rest of the series. We're still on Martha's Vineyard and there are still bluefish to be had, but the plot is a bit far-fetched. J.W. is about to propose to his beloved, Zee, when she is kidnapped. There is a visit from the Padishah of Sarofim (where's that?) a missing necklace, and other inexplicable happenings which add up to a less-than-believable plot. The other books in the series are delightful, so don't let this one discourage you!"
2,Glue too stiff,"Most of the glue in the tube was very stiff, had to remove from tube and mix with small amount of water before applying."
1,Will not buy again!,This product will not stay in place no matter what! Slides right down the leg. I tried several ways of keeping it in place. Save your money.
3,"Good Parts, and not so good.","Good introduction for using prayer to manifest spiritual gifts,but lacking in many details. This book has a good beginning, but gets too much into hard-core preaching and conversion. For a great book on manifesting through prayer, I suggest Tiffany Snow's ""The Power of Divine: A Healer's Guide - Tapping into the Miracle"" or Grace Abbey's ""If You Can Say It, You Can Pray It,"" both of which break through the 'God in a Box' idea and show that certainly all true power comes from God and that He truly answers the heart-felt prayer; even if it may not be from the quote-every-scripture parishioner. Chester shows some scientific fact, as does Tiffany, but for seeing prayer as a definite force in the real world, in real lives, I would have to go with Tiffany and Grace."
4,Good Game,I Think That This is a good Game. You can buy new bows and sowrds and better armor. But it takes a long time to get around
4,Very nice quality and great value,"True, these studs are large and I was a little surprised when I opened the box and saw them for the first time because I didn't expect them to be so large, but I decided to keep them because they are very pretty. Despite the larger than average size, they have a beautiful color, faceting and setting. If you like a large stud, you will love!"
3,Not exactly subtle,"I purchased these for my wife and immediately up on receiving them ran to the local jeweler and replaced them. They're certainly fine for what they are ... nice quality, inexpensive, and large, no humongous, nope - make that huge honking earrings. They're probably best suited to people with a genetic predisposition towards spectacularly sized heads and ears.The three stars are for quaility and value, not asthetics."
3,These are monster size topaz stud earrings!!!,"I purchased these to go with another pair of earrings. Little did I realize that the other reviewers were NOT exagerating. These suckers are huge and you do need the right type of face to be able to pull off wearing them.I really like them and I am sure they will go with a lot of stuff but I don't think I would purchase anything similar.Yes, the earrings are just that big.WOW!!"
4,Haven't read every single word but...,"...It's pretty good so far. (I skip around.) Definitely basic, but a great introduction to archaeological method and history. Lots of good pictures (black and white but still good), some good charts and graphs, nice basic overview of known human cultural history, informative asides on major discoveries, new edition includes very recent discoveries and information. The writing style is clear and not overly simplistic. And the cover is beyond cool for a textbook."
1,Home video,"I would rate this video very poorly. It is more like a home video and not a very good one. Amateur footage, lack of information, and zero excitement."
4,Joo Donato as Great a Master as Jobim,"Simply put, Joo Donato is one of the Bossa Nova masters as a composer and as an original pianist -no more or no lesser than Jobim. This is a piano-bass-drums trio program with Eloir on drums. Donato's original and master command on piano is the featured item on this CD. Highly recommendable."
5,A story of courage and determination,"What a beautiful story of determination, typical of men of the ""frontier"". Action, Justice and plunged into a mythical era of the United States."
2,Not what I expected.,"Perhaps I should have read the description better, but these DVDs aren't what I expected. I expected to recieve DVDs containing the entire Spurs playoff series, instead these DVDs merely provide highlights of the Championship series. Good material, but not what I was looking for."
3,I'm a choco-holic,"I was raised in Europe and I am a choco-holic! That said, I wasn't crazy about these bars. Decent chocolate, but not on my list after trying them out. Pedestrian at best. But it's a matter of taste."
3,not the BEST chocolate,I bought this on a recommendation from a friend in Whales. He said this is the best chocolate over there. I'm in the US (East). Lindt chocolates better.
3,A simple book about simple people.,"Well you can't expect a book about lazy rural farmers to be to exciting, and for the most part it isn't. It is successful in conveying the lifestyle and intellect of these characters, showing their situation and why they will never escape it. Good for some insight to another time and place and a couple of laughs but overall it is a little depressing."
4,Tragi-comic view of Depression-era sharecroppers,"Jeeter Lester is an uneducated and unprincipled failure of a cotton-farmer who stays on the land years after the landowner has given up. Everyone else has gone off to the mills to earn a living, while he and the remnants of his family stay on the farm to starve. In spite of the sad setting, the book is deeply humorous. Caldwell's story-telling is colorful and smacks of authenticity, as if he personally knew people just like the ones in his book. A short, fast and easy read, but well worth it."
3,Is it even plausible?,"Boy, talk about 'moan and groan acres.' The people depicted in Caldwell's short novel are almost unbelievable not only in their ignorance but in their immorality. Women are treated as little more than commodities, while the elderly are totally ignored. The scavengers feeding on the Serengheti plains in Africa have nothing on these rapscallions. Can more selfish, self-serving characters even be imagined? Any comparison with the Joads in ""Grapes of Wrath"" is frivolous, it seems to me. The Joads are no less than moral giants when compared to the folks on ""Tobacco Road."" A fascinating read, but are these characters plausible enough to be taken seriously? Tobacco Road makes Dogpatch seem like a college town."
3,"A fitting end for ignorant, lazy and incestuous rubes.","Although the book was not a total waste of time, as a native Southerner I was highly insulted. The psuedo intellectual New York trendsetters of 1932 probably thought this was typical behavior of Southerners. The Gore Vidal's of the world probably still believe it even today. What insults me the most is that the Modern Library, in their infinite wisdom, have included this book as one of the top 100 novels of the 20th Century and left off some truly magnificent novels about the Deep South like ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" or ""Gone with the Wind"". Come on Shelby Foote where were you when they voted?"
2,Tobacco Road,"I'm not easily offended, but found Tobacco Road obscene. Not for the sex, for the protrayal of poor, white Southerners without compassion, or, in my opinion, any real understanding. Is making the same joke about physical deformities again and again and again satire or even good dark comedy? Not in my book. In well-drawn humor we are able to see our own wekanesses reflected and recognize the human link between ourselves and the most foolish. But Caldwell's characters are so devoid of humanity that poking fun of them just seems juvenile and cruel. Additionally, I found whole passages of the book poorly written and repetitious. I confess to being a Southerner and from poor stock and perhaps that colors my view. But I love Faulkner and O'Conner. I think Caldwell is best forgotten."
2,Disappointed,I am intrigued with the depression era and the people - the description of this book made me think the story would give insight to what people thought and felt during that period. This story was about people who were not right in the head.
4,As discribed,The book arrived ahead of schedule. It is in excelent shape. I was expecting a little more wear so I was pleasantly surprised.
1,Tobacco Road by Erskine Caldwell,"I chose this book because I had heard about it and knew that it was written a long time ago. I am not sure that I will even finish reading it as it is difficult ;to read and repetitive in many areas in the first 4 chapters that I have completed. As I read further I may change my mind, but have reservations."
2,"Doom, Despair, and Agony on Me","For a condescending view of rural poverty and a heapin' helpin' of good old-fashioned god-fearing racism, ""Tobacco Road"" is unrivaled. By all rights, the Nobel Prize should indeed have been awarded to Erskine Caldwell - and to the scriptwriters for ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" and ""Hee-Haw"".The most redeeming feature of this picaresque novel is its brevity. You can easily finish it at one sitting, take a shower, and appreciate the fact that you will never have to read it again."
4,Tobacco Road,"Tobacco Road was a skillfully written novel that acurately protrayed suffering during the Great Depression. It showed how selfish people become when they are fighting to survive. An obvious example of this fact is Old Mother Lester. Everyone was waiting, even hoping, for her to die so they could have more food and not have to think of her anymore. When Dude backed the car into her, no one was even concerned. This novel really showed how cruel the world is sometimes."
5,a brooding black comedy on being poor,"Erskine Caldwell has more in common with James M. Cain than John Steinbeck and this, by far his most famous book (he wrote an awful lot of them) is a vastly entertaining pulp novel about the worst of the wretched.Things are so bad for this family that it has surpassed the epic tragedy of the under-privilaged 'farmer class' of the Depression and into the deserving squalor of hell reserved for the lazy, the ignorant and the spiteful. The story begins with a well-rounded plot to steal a bag of turnips from a man everyone is trying to convince to marry one of the daughters--his much younger cousin.Things do not improve and you'll find yourself growing to enjoy the increasing absurdity of the miserable things that happen, and enlightened by the consistant hopes and failures of each of the many characters.Much better than I'd expected, I blazed through it in a workday and a half, just prior to taking a trip I had planned to read this book en route to."
3,Natural Selection at Work!,"I was alternately repulsed by the author's apparent hatred of poor people and horrified to admit that I believe people like this exist. Is it worse to coldly allow such people to starve and abuse each other, or help them persevere and reproduce? A question for the ages - and for Republicans and Democrats to duke out... It would have been noble for Jeeter to keep his feet on the land if only he hadn't been too lazy and ignorant to do anything useful there. Do we need to build more poor houses for people too helpless to look after themselves? Or would / does this just help them perpetuate their gene pool? This question is certainly as valid now as it ever was."
2,Southerners.,"A touching, moving drama about the perseverance of the human spirit and the brotherhood of man. Not!Are Southerners fated to be so self destructive? Read ""The Jungle"" instead - there's something more sypathetic about people who actually try, but fail than about people who fail because they don't even try."
2,older book,"a 1947 version of the book was sent with very brown pages and a cracked binding. i do appreciate the date of thebook, but the condition was misrepresented."
4,Tobacco Road,"This book is in good shape for its age. I've already watched the movie, and so far, the book is very similar."
1,One star is generous in this case.,"This book is perhaps the most disgusting display of blatant prejudice I have ever witnessed in a work of fiction. I don't believe Mr. Caldwell could possibly have interacted on any personal level with any of the people whom he so cruelly and stereotypically portrays. As a resident of the South, I have had literally thousands of narratives of the Great Depression passed down to me through family and friends. None ever reflected anything in the realm of this book. ""Tobacco Road"" reflects a view that poverty equals inhumanity, and this could not be farther from the truth. As social parody this book is almost entertaining--but taken as seriously as the tone of the writing encourages, it is ludicrous."
3,A fake 40's movie in black and white?,"This movie kind of struck me as an anti-Casablanca:CasablancaInstead of everybody being good and noble, we have the Americanbehaving at times like Nazis in this film.This story is about a 1946 Berlin where the people are living in the ruinsand the GI's are kings.The jeep driver thinks he has hit real pay dirtwhen it turns out his German girl friend -prostituteis married to someone both the Russians and Americans want.But the newspaper reporter he is driving also remembers herfrom before the war. Lena is a case of survival at any costand pretty much hates herself worse than anyone else could,yet men makes fools of themselves over her.The acting is pretty good and the movie almost convinces youthat this was the 40's again.Even the end is the same as Casablanca with an airplane leaving,but what is between sort makes you wonder who really won that war?"
1,The Bad German,What a disappointment this movie was...from the gratuitous sex scene with Spiderman to the perjured Casablanca type ending. Almost made me sick. Worst World War II movie I ever saw. This had such potential and they really blew it.
3,correction,In my review I accidently wrote that Humphrey Bogart had used the line Frankly My Dear I don't give a damn.It was actually Clark Gable who said it in Gone With The Wind. OOOOPS! Sorry folks!
3,"Nice try, but the story doesn't fly","Some stylish bits, enjoyable black and white, wisps of 40's Warner's Bros style music..there are some things that work good in this film. A plodding story that really never gets off the ground. Style cannot surmount a weak story. Clooney and especially Blanchett make it worthwhile for at least one go-around. Some rough language and one sex scene just didn't belong."
3,Good picture of post war Germany,"I feel the story was quite compelling and showed through the characters the misery most were left in post 2nd world war and how much 'greyer' the world had become. Few had survived without significant pain, loss or outright compromises to their own ethics and values. Mans survival instinct came first for most and without judging the movie showed this very well while remaining both authentic and entertaining.The ending could in my mind have been better put together but still an above average experience with excellent performances by several of the characters. Another movie where I find it hard to comprehend the 1s and 5s given!"
2,The Book Was Much Better,"I loved the black and white format of this film, but found the acting wooden and the plot tired. The book was much better. This film, albeit an interesting and creative technical piece, sorely lacked the nuance and brilliance of the book. One star for effort and one star for the black-and-white."
2,buy the book instead,"The movie is stylish but the book is far more thought-provoking, intelligent and entertaining. This movie is so very loosely based on the book that I hardly recognized it."
1,A Real Stinker,"Steven Soderbergh unfortunately is a hit, miss, miss, miss, miss, miss director. Kafka still remains, to this day, my favorite of his films and it is not even on DVD.This film was terrible.Awful."
2,A decent film.,"I was relieved to know Toby Maguire's whiny tough guy character wasn't going to be through the whole film. That has to be one of the worst mis-castings I've seen in a long while!Clooney and Blanchett are really good, but the plot twists are too predictable in following the WWII film noir structure. There was no ""punch"" in the script."
3,Coulda been good.......but,"Film Noir this is not. The B&W; ""newsreel"" effect, with extreme highlighting and no middle tones, is annoying. Same thing with the sound or audio mix which is hollow and again, annoying to the viewer.Actually, a terrific storyline. Post WW2 trauma in Berlin. The good, bad, and ugly, re-visited during Potsdam.The plot is not so much weak as it is mis-directed with a final that screams for additional footage.Jack Thompson, who stole the show in ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"", is totally wasted. George Clooney does not do well playing it weak. However, Cate Blanchett does a pretty good Ingrid Bergman.Production Design by Phillip Messina is excellent. You really get the feel.Worth a watch."
3,worthy and entertaining homage,"THE GOOD GERMAN isn't bad. C'mom, comparing it to the classics it is inspired by and ripping off isn't fair. Enjoy it for what's it's worth, which isn't a whole, whole lot, but is still better than most junk coming out of Hollywoodland. The acting is good as is, in my opinion, the script. I found the story involving American efforts to snatch up Nazi rocket scientists, a quintessential American jack ***, a murderous lying prostitute, the cool well intended George Clooney trapped in a film noir plot, the score, the black and white picture, and war ravaged setting add up to a something worth the price of a rental fee. Guess I like the films THE GOOD GERMAN copies and don't mind that Steven Soderbergh didn't make a new classic on their level. Kind of a tall order there folks. I give him props for his efforts. Film snobs, just stick to your library of Criterion Collection films and your expensive wine and cheeses."
2,The Good German???,"This film bears so little resemblance to the book that I don't know how they can even use the name. While those who have not read the book will no doubt find some redeeming features in the movie, I wonder if those who read the book were as disappointed as I was, especially with the unemotional acting and lack of intrigue. I could not have cared less about any of the characters and it certainly did not have the post-war atmosphere of Berlin that the book had. I guess that is the problem with seeing a movie made from a book one has really enjoyed - disappointment - but not usually to this extent."
1,Poor Adaptation,"Soderburgh's attempt at noir failed and seemed more like an excuse to use footage from war-ravaged Berlin than a real embrace of the genre. Soderburgh's noir attempt also fell flat because there was too much unneceessary violence and voyeristic embrace of the bizarre (the legless Jew who had been experimented on, but suddenly is running a shop in Berlin a few months after surviving a concentration camp?) whereas genuine noir is understated. Noir aside, the real problem with this film is a disastrous screenplay. The novel's rich texture of minor characters (and even major figures like Gunter) disappear and, as has been mentioned other reviews, Lena's character is completely transformed and ruined. The ""surprise"" at the end of the film was a poor attempt of making a profound statement about morality and survival in the Third Reich."
2,adjustment on the lighting anyone?,"read the novel. it was ok. saw the movie. got the director's intention. but some big problems. blanchett as dietrich/garbo. not a good idea. she's great, just poorly directed. too bad. clooney? he'll do. the problem is he is not a facially or emotionally conveying, expressive ennough actor to pull off a 'presentational' acting performance. he just comes across as moving stone. the soundtrack, at least on the dvd, is defective: dialouge is barely audible, have to raise the volume, then the music screams out. total imbalance and really irritating. my worst gripe is the lighting. sorry. it's all washed out. loved the black and white choice. obvious in this instance, but film noir did not wash out faces to the extent they are walking lightbulbs against a sheet of black construction paper. so who did the cinematography? i'm not in the film business, but the choices were right, just poorly executed. too bad. this kind of film, on paper, is what i dream of as a moviegoer."
1,Not like the book,"On what planet did they make this movie? It is so different from the book, e.g. Lena and Renate are combined into one character which completely changes Lena's relationship with Jake. I thought the book was an excellent read and was so looking forward to seeing it as a movie -- total disappointment! And when George Clooney isn't getting beat up, he looks jowly and worn-out. If you liked the book, don't bother with the movie!"
2,disappointed,"The one thing I would have liked to know before purchasing this movie was the use of the ""f"" word, plus the plot was thin. I was disappointed in this movie for the simple fact of the language and find this word to be soooo offensive. I also find this to be a juvenilistic approach to making a movie. Can't the actors act without using this kind of language. If they had wanted to make a movie in the old style maybe they should have paid attention to some of the old movies. I just watched ""Twelve O'Clock High"" with Gregory Peck which was great and no offensive language, the actors and the plot stood on their own."
2,Not the book!,The movie was very disappointing to someone who read the book. The author created a very important message that was diffused by the movie.
2,The Reviews Here are Longer than the Movie,And i don't know which is worse? Beautifully filmed is about all i can say. its a goofy film and i was glad when i saw the wordsThe End. If you're really bored? Rent it. Don't waste your money on this one.
3,pretty good with all the noir ingreditents but,"there was nothing to tell but the corruption of the occupy forces, russian or american, they were all the same. there were no good germans either. survival by the fittest, that's all. the only good guy was the guy who enslaved himself to an one-sided romance. but in general, this movie is quite plain and bored, like watching a drama played on the stage. the black and white feel was not quite strong and the sound track was a bit too modern."
2,Looks nice. Can't remember much about the plot...,They all look nice in b/w. But why is this movie so unmemorable? Maybe because I just could not bring myself to care about the story or the characters. I really can't recommend it except for the set design and photography.
2,Weak script and terrible faux-noir cinematography,"Classic film noir has a crisp, high-contrast look. ""The Good German"" has gauzy, soft-focus cinematography that would be more appropriate in a perfume commercial. The mushy images and consistently overexposed highlights make the film hard on the eyes and a chore to watch.The poor cinematography might be tolerable if the script were worthwhile. Unfortunately, the script is even worse than the photography. The story plods from one uninteresting plot point to another with no sense of momentum. The acting is nothing special, either -- not that anyone could save such an ugly, badly written film.The obvious comparison is to Jacques Tourneur's ""Berlin Express,"" a 1948 noir set in post-war Berlin. Tourneur's film is one of his weaker efforts, but it's a minor masterpiece compared to Soderbergh's failed pseudo-noir."
1,Find a better German...any German...this isn't it,"Other reviewers amplify the film noir, historical accuracy of post-war Berlin, Soderbergh's artistic interpretation...enough. It's been done before and done better, Not even Clooney's charm and wisecracks can save this. As any good American will understand, this one's a huge swing and a miss. Don't let your curiosity get the better of you. Take a pass."
5,The best motivational speaker I've ever heard...,"It is sad to think Earl has been dead for many years now. I first listened to his recordings almost twenty years ago and instantly became a great admirer. If you're someone who is searching for the basic answer of what to do with your life, or just need a re-assuring nudge, listen to this...it helped change my life.Earl's stories make everything so clear that there is only one basic answer to success and happiness, with the former clearly meaning the latter, i.e., to simply find a way to service others. It may be thru employment or it may be thru entrepreneurship...whichever, Earl demonstrates that doing something you enjoy that helps others in life is the only way to live.Enjoy!"
5,The All Time Bestt,"I still listen to the CD's (used to be tapes) 30+ years after I first bought them.I recommend to all my nieces and nephews.I am currently listening to the CD's with my 11 year old son.The principals on the CD's are timeless. Live by them, and you will keep succeeding your entire life."
4,Learning to Overcome,"One man's struggle with multiple additions leads him to not a 12 step program but to God as well. The story shows how through God, anyone's life can be changed and our demons can be overcome.The book is very well written and is a truly inspiring read for anyone who is dealing with any sort of addiction issues. It shows us that through faith all things are possible."
1,Save Your Time And Your Dime,"This has to be the WORST ""true crime"" book that I have ever written. While giving credit to Lisa McVey and Susan Replogle (victims of the book's subject), this piece of work is nothing but disguised effort to toot the horn of the book's primary author, and actual writer, Joy Wellman.Many of the ingredients typical of a true crime were missing from this book; such as details regarding trials, the investigation, many other victims, etc. The reader is provided pretty indepth detail about two victims, general information is provided about others, but some victims are mentioned only in passing. The remainder of the book focuses on the author and co-authors friendship, their desire to teach women to speak out against sexual crimes committed against them, and their lives following Bobby Joe Long, the convicted. And it for this reason that this book should be listed in the biography section versus the true crime category."
1,"Good Effort, Poor Execution","It was a good effort. The storyline did have an unexpected twist at the end which redeemed this travesty of literature in my eyes. However the editing was non-existent, the characters were one-dimensional and unbelievable. (A woman as strong as Cynthia is portrayed would not stay in a domestic violence situation for 10 years.) There were numerous syntax errors which were very distracting and kept me from taking the book too seriously. The use of the different fonts was also distracting. An artist paints a picture and lets the viewer interpret for themselves what it means. A viewer of a fine painting tries describing what the painting is telling them. The author spent too much time spelling things out and not enough time painting her verbal picture, letting the reader explore the emotions invoked on Cynthia's roller-coaster ride for themselves."
2,Good luck getting one undamaged.,You're better off to pick these up from your like home improvement store for less money. There's a Hampton Bay just like it at the depot.
2,I don't really hate it but is just that is not the one I wanted and I would like to exchange it. having a little problem .,I was saying I would like to exchange it having problem with that can get enyone to help. Change it to the one I really like to have.
1,Mulligan for Bobby Jobe,Thought I was sending our youngest son a birthday present.....turns out this version was not the one my husband and I listened to in the car but an abbreviated version that requires a special CD that he does not have in his car.
2,Are these reviewers as blind as Bobby Jobe?,"I mean, come on. A blind golfer? I thought it was an intruiging premise, too, until I tried to hit balls with my eyes closed. I'm a 2-handicapper, and I was completely hapless. So forgive me if my suspension of disbelief came crashing down.That said, Cullen writes a pleasant, if completely farfetched tale, with likeable characters. However, I thought the best parts of the book had nothing to do with golf. The subplot involving the mentally ill father was actually more interesting, believable and touching, and the best part of the book was a short bit about Allegheny men and their pickup trucks."
3,Not a very soothing voice,"This lady is effective but her voice sounds very nasal, uber New Yawk. She also does weird things like encouraging your breathing to be like ""snoring through your noise,"" then she makes this irritating noise several times. Also her microphone picks up every noise she makes, and she makes a lot of annoying ones. Other than the annoying, and not very relaxing method of the instructor, the yoga is great and makes you feel wonderful. Its pretty easy to follow and includes modifications. How this lady became a yoga instructor with a less-than-calming voice is beyond me, but once you get past your ""Downward Dawgs"" and general voice, its pretty good."
4,Great for a beginner like me,"I don't know if this really works for fertility, but it has definitely helped me calm my nerves. I focus more on relaxed breathing throughout the day, and my body feels much better.It is easy to follow, tons of options for people (like me) who aren't as flexible. I definitely recommend it. I rarely do the whole thing, but it is easy to jump from one section to another. The host's breathing is a little dramatic, but not too bad."
4,Great Sequence -- instructor is very perky,"I own several other yoga videos and have been practicing yoga off and on for 3 years, and thought I'd turn to yoga to help with my chances of conception. I found this sequence to flow very well, but Monica is a little more ""perky"" than what I'm typically used to. (My favorite yoga DVD is Hemalaya Behl's ""Yoga for Urban Living"".) However, once you are several minutes into it, you get used to Monica's tone and can enjoy the practice."
2,Not For Beginners ....,"Some women might really enjoy this DVD; however, I was not one of them. I've been practicing yoga for about three months by taking some classes and using the AM/PM tapes successfully every day. This tape required balance and flexibility that I just don't have. In addition, Monica Morell is big on stretches for the ""thyroid"" which means a lot of back and neck bending. These did very little for me and actually made me feel sick. As I said, some folks might really love this tape; it just wasn't for me."
4,Relaxing,"I enjoy this 50 minute yoga practice, and feel that doing it provides me with a sense of peace and calm during an extremely stressful time. I would definitely recommend it to other women going through fertility treatments."
2,unsatisfactory,"I expected a longer video with much more variety of poses,but the video was not satisfactory.It is just an ordinary yoga session"
1,The WORST Yoga DVD ever!!!!,"Like another reviewer said this is really a trap for desperate women. She was clever to name it ""Fertility Yoga"" because otherwise she would not have sold a single copy!! Her voice is annoying and her cueing is awful. There is nothing calming about this and come on she uses ""Crack open your chest"" for chest opening instruction, and ""Snoring with your mouth closed"" is not the best explaination of Ujayi breath!! There was nothing in this DVD that would make it specifically beneficial for fertility as opposed to other Yoga DVDs. You would be much better off with Barbara Benagh's ""Yoga for Stress Relief"". At least she is a quality instructor and the DVD is well made. Don't waste your money on this one! All those positive reviews must have been from friends of hers. Oh Yeah, at one point I think she actually burped while she was talking."
5,THIS IS THE BEST CD I OWN,WELL I'M 38 YEARS OLD AND I'VE PLAYED T.REXES ELECTRIC WARRIOR FROM THE LATE 70'S TILL NOW. I STARTED OFF WITH HIS RECORD THEN CASSETTE NOW CD AND I CAN SAY THAT I LOVE IT JUST AS MUCH TODAY AS I DID WHEN I FIRST HEARD IT.THIS IS ONE CD I WILL NEVER GET SICK OF.TO ME MARK BOLIN IS RIGHT UP THERE BESIDE ELVIS.I RECOMMEND TO ANYONE THAT DON'T HAVE THIS CD GET IT AND I BET YOU WON'T BE LET DOWN
4,Great summer music,"When I hear this album I am reminded of warm summer evenings, getting high and dancing with friends. This is a great album, a truly positive addition to any album collection"
1,Electric Warrior by Marc Bolan and T Rex,"I ordered this product on 04/12/11 and have yet to receive it. I have sent mulitple emails and last week was told that they resent the item, but I still have not seen it in my mailbox. It's been over a month now. Not cool.This is a GREAT CD and I purchased this one to replace one that has gone missing. I was really looking forward to hearing it again..."
1,are you kidding me!!,"Im not an angry person bashing any old music. Im a musician bashing this bullfunk. Seriously, with all the good reviews on this page, they must be hopped up on cocaine. Im a huge 1970's fan myself and this is out of control. Please spare your self the $40.00 or 17.00 and buy something else. Like good blues if your into blues. Cause this is irritating. Peace out you crack fiends"
5,Good Luck,"This gem is out of print and hard to find. The 5.1 mixing is exceptional and demo worthy. This disc will show the gravitas of any high end sound system. According to CNET.Com, this disc is among the top 10 DVD-Audio discs to covet, [...]The disc includes a video of an early 70's English version of American Bandstand. T-Rex performs a lip synch of Bang-a-Gong with a then newcomer Elton John faking on piano. Hysterical. The video may only be available for playback on DVD-Audio players.If you ever acquire a copy, you will not be disappointed. Unless you don't care for this sort of music, eh?"
2,Not as good as SACD 2003 version,"This is an awesome album, however, the remaster job is not as good as SACD version. Even CD layer doesn't have that punch. Try finding out the SACD version. You won't be dissapointed."
3,Over-rated and non-essential,"So overrated. He wasn't a great guitarist, singer or even much of a songwriter. Unless you think rewriting '50s doo-wop and standard blues tunes is some great achievement. And how come every song that could be considered a rock tune sounds like a Bang A Gong or Jeepster rewrite. Adding strings to R&R? Seems contradictory. Does he want to be a rocker or a pop star? There are some good songs, like Raw Ramp & Mambo Sun, but there's a sameness to almost everything here. It's not a bad album but I don't see what all the fuss was about. This was listed in Rolling Stone magazine as one of the top 100 albums of all time. Yeah, sure."
2,Tastes Change,"I remembered liking this album in the early 70s when it was released, so I bought the CD. Tastes change, including mine."
2,"Not a Suitable ""Anniversary Edition""","As much as I love the music of Marc Bolan, I was very disappointed with this release. As the previous reviewer mentioned, there's nothing going for this album: no original album design, no lyrics, and poor reproduction. In a way, it does spoil the album for me. With the ""30th Anniversary Edition"" one would expect to see a wonderfully packaged tribute to a great album; instead this seems to have been hastily put together, almost as an after thought. C'mon - Marc deserved better than this!Buy the old edition and let's hope justice is done on the next anniversary."
5,Entre Joyas,"Este album se encuentra entre uno de los mejores en la epoca del Rock and Roll.Marc Bolan,poeta musical que demuestra su poderio como guitarrista y cantante a la vez,en canciones como ""Mambo Sun"" ""jeepster"" y el clasico que lo puso en el pedestal como uno de los mejores.es ""Bang a gong""(get it on) con la ayuda del gran percusionista y vocal,Micky Finn,se podrian identificar mejor como los dos grandes ""TIRANOSAURIOS"" de esa etapa.Un gran Album en verdad!"
3,Buy the Japanese version!,"My friend bought this version and the drop-out on Mambo Son stinks.......it sets the tone for disapointment. The lack of lyrics bites too. I bought the Japanese import for 25 bucks and this thing rocks. It includes a picture disk with album style slip case. The slip case, per the original album, has the lyrics on the back and includes a album sleeve just like an album. Plus thier is another booklet with seperate lyrics as well. It also includes a fold up mini poster of the original artwork from inside the lp with Marc in his chair. Another booklet has Tony's pictures and notes on the album. The sound quality is on par with todays digital recordings, which is excellent. The Japanese sure know thier way around recording equipment."
3,Get the English version! But get it!,"The English reissue of this features many bonus demo versions of the songs on the proper album but, more importantly, it was re-mastered by original producer Tony Visconti and George Marino. It is much warmer and stronger than this US version, which was remastered by Bill Inglot and Dan Hersch in their typically harsh, tinny way. Go to amazon.co.uk now! And it's a near-perfect album."
4,Glam-rock heaven...,"I remember listening to this on my older brother's phonograph (that's right, those ancient appliances) and thinking how hip it was back in the mid seventies. When they re-issued it, I knew I had to have it.Its just innovation at its best. The only one to come close to capturing Marc Bolan's sound in the last 25 years is probably Lenny Kravitz. Songs like Get it On, Jeepster, Mambo Sun are so fun its creepy.The sound quality on the remastered versions is excellent so you won't be disappointed. Now if I could just find the old album cover somewhere..."
5,One of the most influential albums of the 1970's,"In my opinion, T.Rex is one of the most underated bands of all time. I also belive this is one of the greatest rock n' roll albums of all time. Next to Bowie's Ziggy Stardust, this is the most difinitive album of the Glam Rock era. Every song is great, and the extras make the album even better. Marc Bolan was a true musical genious, and one of the great forgotten artists. I would recomend this to any fan of old school rock.HOGEY OUT!"
5,TRex at his best,"You won't like this unless you are into the classics of Rock and Roll. It's like a hub cap diamond star halo, it's dirty sweet and it's one of my all time favorites!"
1,Book riddled with lies,This book was probably written only to make Prince Philip and British Intelligence happy about Diana's 'accident'. No mention about Dodi's supposed engagement to marry Diana shortly before the accident.
4,Diana's True Love Wasn't Dodi!,"After reading this book, I am convinced that the author speaks the truth. Hasnat Khan's name comes up in several books, and they all state Diana felt strongly for him. I do believe she was with Dodi Fayed to make Mr. Khan jealous. I certainly can picture her with a heart surgeon more easily than I can with a playboy who didn't know what to do with all his money. I also read Paul Burrell's book, ""A Royal Duty"" and he alludes to Diana's true love, though he doesn't give him a name. He does say it was not Dodi. I believe that had Diana lived, she would have possibly married Hasnat Khan, or at least maintained a loving relationship with him. She didn't know Dodi well enough to even think of marrying him; the relationship was simply a summer fling. It's sad that she did not live to see that happiness with Dr. Khan come to fruition."
2,Mediocre and voyeuristic tale of Diana's last 2 lovers,"Uninspiring, petty and boring. I adored Diana, and truly enjoyed the exhaustively detailed biographies that have come out in the last 5 years. This isn't one of them. It is neither memorable nor does it have any excellent new pictures of the Princess - except the one on the cover. We read nothing new about James Hewitt nor Camilla, nor Will Carling, and a lot of drivel about Hasnat Kahn. Yawn. Wait for something else to come out."
1,Establishment Lies,"There is no shred of evidence to back up this fantasy book.This pile of rubbish is aimed at wiping out the truth about Princess Diana's loving relationship with Dodi Fayed. And if you wipe out the truth about their relationship, then you wipe out the truth about how they were killed.British intelligence is behind the assassination of Diana and Dodi because their love affair was a shock for the British royal family. Prince Charles can kiss his two children good bye unless they are morons they will surely recognise the truth of what happened to their mother.Fortunately Mohammed Al-Fayed with deep pockets and a commitment to the memory of his son is out there speaking for truth."
4,"Good smokey flavor, problem with melting","I'm a big fan of gouda, and I love the smoked flavor, so this cheese was a big hit for me. However, the cheese has a slight 'plasticied' consistency. It's hard to explain except that it didn't melt like other normal goudas I've had in the past. It's great for slicing up and putting on turkey sandwiches. Also makes a nice snack when cut into small wedges. I don't think this would go well in a fondu, unless you used it in combination with another blander type base cheese for your sauce."
3,A let down from the previous book..,"This book picks up where ""With This Ring"" finishes. I was actually disappointed with this book after reading the first one. There was no introduction, and the book goes from Michael and Deanna adjusting as newlyweds, only to 1 strip after Baby Meridith is born. I thought that this book would be more towards the baby's birth, but it wasn't. I enjoyed it however, more so for the other storylines in the book."
2,Theoretical Analyses,"Self-Defeating Behaviors reads as a college psychology text. Although the end of the book offers a methodical process to analyze and change your behaviors, too much of the book is devoted to the clinical study of our behaviors. I would have benefited from the book had it included more case studies and client experiences and less scientific explication."
2,"Well, the highest expectations dashed","I wanted to love this book and I've read so many self help books over the years I do think I have a pretty good eye for quality writing and useful information.. this book wasn't too useful. I am amazed that there are so many positive reviews but I found the book repetitive and quite frankly tough to find any useful ideas on defeating the ""self defeating behaviors"" that we all would love to be free from. Maybe the book is a bit too technical but again there should be easier ways to help people and this book was certainly not an easy or interesting guide to improvement. In summary, there are plenty of other good books out there to help you improve yourself."
3,Cute doll - definitely for younger children,"She's beautiful and very soft, but there's not a lot to do w/her other than cuddle. Very nicely made and packaged, though."
2,Not very good...,I could only read an hour of this. I always hate doing this to my own brethren but I can't recommend this.
5,Well satisfied,"I have purchased this book before and felt i needed more copies to give to others as gifts. It's one of the more relevant books that I've ever read. It's a different perspective on the book of Revelation than most people have, but well substantiated by Scripture."
2,DRY!,"This book is awful if you are a first time learner of ESL. I thought this book to be full of big words that were needless and dry unentertaining language. I understand it is not meant to entertain but to educate, however, it was VERY difficult to read while trying to complete an ESL course."
3,"while nicely crafted, these are HUGE!","Please be sure and pay attention to the scale image and the other reviewers comments as these earrings are huge - larger than my earlobes. If you want bling, but these. If you want subtle everyday earrings, look elsewhere."
3,big and tacky,i was on the search for big and tacky earrings... and i found them!! they are HUGE. i find the sterling silver to be a bit soft so the posts bend easily. dont think i've ever had sterling silver earrings before so i dont know if they are supposed to or not. but if your not looking for big and tacky these arent for you. the stone itself is bigger than my ear lobe. because they are bigger than i was expecting i dont wear them often. so i think the amount i paid was a little too much considering the amount of wear i will get out of them.
3,Domesticated Ringneck Doves,There is not enough information given on the domesticated Ringneck Dove. The book emphasizes too much on avaries and wild dove behavior and husbandry. It actually states that keeping a Dove in a cage is not a good idea when the Ringneck is a very good cage bird--but they do have specific husbandry requirements that need to be addressed.
3,grandmajulie,I have not got the bird yet for my grandaughter but by looking at it myself it will be very helpful
2,'Eh - Plain cholesterol works just as good,Bought this to soften my beard. I had been using a great cholesterol product that was 1lb for $1 but I can no longer find it.I put this product on in the shower after I washed my beard and let it sit for 5-10 mins. It helped some but I expected more. Plus it made my chest break out really bad. I feel there are better Cholesterol products to be found and cheaper.
2,"Good artists, bad selection of songs","The set contains some really good artists. However, they don't sing the songs for which they were known for singing. Nearly all are singing songs normally associated with another artist. Maybe that is why the song list isn't given on the site. In my opinion, not worth the money even though it is low priced."
4,"It pokes, so it must be working","Pretty good value for the price. I do wish it were one piece, as opposed to three. The poker, shaft, and handle are all separate pieces that screw together. They always seem to loosen on mine. I use mine for outdoor campfires, so I may be a little rougher on mine than most.P.s. If you use yours outside, I've found that a couple pieces of reflective tape on the shaft will help you find it in the dark."
5,Does its job,"What can I say, it's a standard fireplace / firepit poker. I use it for my firepit and it can both lift the spark guard with the hook, and move wood around with the poker. Solid, sturdy, and matches the black iron of any firepit.The only negative is you have to check from time to time that the handle is screwed tight into the shaft. But nothing that's worth docking a star from the review."
2,Tip and shaft come apart all the time.,Poker is made in 3 parts which are screwed together. The handle screws on securely but the shaft and tip dont seat securely. It comes apart all the time during use. Buy something better.
4,Poke and pull,"This is a pretty good poker, however, I gave 4 stars as the poker end tends to unscrew a little bit and becomes loosened (not that it falls off). Some type of metal cement type product would solve that quickly (as another type of glue might melt or degrade from the heat of the fire)."
3,love the size ...but...,"the perfect size , i find the shorter model like this is so much easier to move... I noticed the handle is lose fitting , even when tight it has wiggle in the threads... I think i will end up epoxying the handle on... poorly machined rod threads are this products only flaw."
3,A little LOK_TITE needed,"I purchased the Homebasix Fireplace Poker 27"", Black because I just wanted a simple poker - no frills. This one ir OK and the price is right, but you need to buy some LOK-TITE along with it as the business end of it is loose in the threads and comes loose while trying to pull or push a log."
4,Nice for the price!,"I just needed a simple poker to tend to fireplace use, and shopped all around, only to find less attractive, much more expensive pokers. This one has good weight, (solid iron) shorter than i expected, but actually is just the right length to move the logs without getting hot and without too much effort seen with a longer poker. I have been using it almost daily and its perfect. Great purchase!"
5,best cookie sheet,"This is the best cookie sheet ever. It is made of a heavy gauge steel that doesn't curl, but remains flat when heated. I thought it was a little pricey, but it is defiantly worth the money. The saying goes, ""You get what you pay for."" I would recommend this to everyone. I have a convention oven that these sheets works great in. There are no walls and the cookies/ pizza/ whatever you are baking slide off easily."
5,Great Cookie Sheet,"Cookie sheet arrived with no scratches or marks. After a couple of dozen uses (cookies, croissants, biscuits, pies) the sheet hasn't warped at all. Extra thick and heavy aluminum is a must for cookie sheets."
4,Great but too long.,"I have only used once and it bakes great. Only problem is the length is too long for my oven and so I have to use it sideways which is a little tricky with taking it in and out of the hot oven with the raised edges to grab on to, being only on the long sides."
4,Too big for dishwasher; otherwise great,I was looking for an uncoated cookie sheet that is dishwasher safe and this was the only one I could find. It works great but unfortunately is too big to fit in our dishwasher.
5,Love my pans,"Received my cookies sheets, sent on the date promised and I just love it. The quality of the metal was awesome. I will not have to get replacements for years to come!"
5,if you love cookies,"I purchased this pan through a different company. Cookies cook evenly with good color. Can be used with parchment paper, Silpat but also used with cooking spray. Worked great with all. Much better than other cookies sheets on the market. Definitely a must have if you love cookies."
4,Glue problem solved,"The glue that attaches the label to this produce has been discontinued. Instead the sheets arrived with a peel-off plastic that was easily removed. The edges are sharp, it's true, and I'd be cautious when handling them to not let my hand slide along those edges. But, the quality of the metal is top notch, and these should last for generations giving consistent baking results. I'm thinking about having my husband polish those edges to round them off. I wonder why it isn't done at the factory?"
3,Not the holy grail,"I do not understand why people rave about this cookie sheet. Yes, it's very sturdy. Yes, it's a decent cookie sheet. But they haven't made my cookies any better than when I used my Calphalon cookie sheets. If anything, they've made some of my cookies worse because I was used to the darker color of Calphalon, and the Vollrath sheets, with the lighter color, bake differently. I'm sure I probably just have to get used to the new sheet and lighter coloring, ergo different baking times, BUT, for the price tag, I'm not sold quite yet."
3,Over-rated,"Yes, this is a good cookie sheet. It is not the ""holy grail"" as if it bakes better cookies. Your descendents will not be fighting over it. It is just a good cookie sheet. There are cheaper ones that are just as good. My teenage daughters make cookies every other day and I have spied on their cookie sheet choice, and no, they are not always choosing this one. I am rating it low just because every one else is over-rating it and creating hype that should not exist."
2,"better title 'Words about the Dragon, Press Reports'","The title of the book Words of the Dragon, Interviews 1985-1973"" reflects a little bit a wrong impression of the book. A better title would be Words about the Dragon, Press Report 1958-1973"". At the beginning of the book a few things are repeated over and over again. It seems that it would be difficult to investigate e.g. how old Bruce Lee was when his parents returned to Hong Kong. Only at the end of this book one could catch a small impression of Bruce Lee's philosophy. His carrier as an actor comes primarily up. The US Press didn't understand until Bruce Lee's death that his art wasn't Karate. I expected more philosophically thoughts and background knowledge of his martial art. The Bruce Lee connoisseur gained no really news and I thing the book isn't stimulating for beginners. I was impressed by the letter of Brandon Lee, which is printed at the end of the book."
4,"Pretty good, but...","It was a pretty good book, however, like people have mentioned, some of the stuff is repeated. A lot. I don't know how many interviews he did in that period of time, but I wish they had done better choosing what they did instead of repeating so much of the same stuff. The one I really wish they had put in there was his most famous interview. The one they video taped, where he talks about everything while trying out for a tv show. If you've seen the new Enter the Dragon 25 year anniversary, its the one before the movie that lasts like 15 minutes. They should have included a text version in this book.If you find this book on sale at a used book store or something, pick it up, it's worth it. But don't go spending full price for this, because it isn't worth it. If you find it on Amazon here along with another book (like Tao of Gung Fu and this together) then go ahead and get them. To buy this book solo though would just be a waste, you would have it done within a couple of hours."
2,"Still Bruce, but...","I heard several of these interviews from other sources. If YOU haven't then the book might be worth your time and money, but then again even the interviews in the book get old. Each interviewer asks the same questions and Bruce gives the same answers. It's less thrilling than other Bruce Lee books."
3,ZZZZzzzzz,"Just another excuse for Disney to make more cash by beating a dead horse. Most of the songs have already been released, but what I can't understand is that Disney does have some great singers, like Lalaine and Annaliese Van Der Pol, but chooses not to use their music in any compilations. BIG mistake. I don't know who's to blame for all the trash Disney has been putting out, but I sure do wish it would just stop.The only saving grace in the entire album is Aly & AJ. No, the song isn't that great, but unlike the others they truly have talent."
5,BUY THIS!!!!!!,I just bought this CD and. . .I LUV iT!!! Please get it! You will regret it if u dont! There are awesome songs on this CD.
1,barf,"GIRLZ ROCK????Dude, at least use proper grammar if you wanna be taken seriously. A pure sign that you're trying to appeal to 10-year-olds who believe there's such a thing as ""girl power! omg giggle giggle""... oh, and can't spell."
4,Positive Message with a Good Beat,"I searched for a while for a good 'starter' cd for my daughter, she is 6 yrs old and we monitor what she listens to and sees quite a bit, so I wanted something 'today style' but still positive and I got her this CD and she really likes it.. she has a great time dancing away in her room to it. I like the positive message in the songs and she loves the great beat.I would recommend to parents and kids :)"
4,purchased for my 6 year old daughter,"Basically, of the 5 CD's I purchased for her she likes this one the best. There are a few ""louder"" songs that we skip but on the whole this one is a winner"
5,Hehe...Secret Addiction,"My friends would be shocked to know that I listen to this CD ona regular basis. I love the Calieigh Peters song, and Hayden Pannetierre & Myra's as well. They are great for young girls, and even for teens as I've discovered. I even find myself liking the Lindsay Lohan songs! I never thought I liked her music, but these songs are an exception.This CD really is great.I liked it alot."
2,Pointless,The only song worth listening to is by Myra and Lindsey Lohan. The rest is by a bunch of overrated Disney girls who think they can sing.
2,pouring splatters and drips,"I love the size of this jug, but when it's fuller it splatters and drips when you pour. It will also leak if it tips over. I'm surprised Rubbermaid has put a product out there like this. I have always trusted a Rubbermaid product before."
2,lworks,Didnt leak. The handle came apart real quick. It holds water in the cap and when you unscrew it the water spills out. Wouldnt recommend.
1,NOT Leak Proof,"The product is useless, it leaks in the car during transportation a n d while drinking. V e r y disappointing."
2,Not as depicted,Picture indicates a flip top but the it was the same cap style we were trying to replace. Caps break easily and bottles tend to leak.
2,The handle pops off every time!!,"This jug would have been great except the handle pops off EVERY TIME you use it. VERY annoying!! It pops off on both sides. I actually bought 2 of these jugs, from different sellers. The handle pops off on BOTH jugs. This product was a very bad design.The latch that you flip open to take a drink ALSO POPS OFF every time you use it!!DON""T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY - get the kind that has the spout that flips up."
1,Forgot to mention not in English?,I was looking for one with translations into english. Found one that did translate.Problelm is its the only one! Sorry didn't work out!
5,ooOOOPPPPS! Amendment,"I compared 'The Time Machine' to 'The Fantastic Planet' - This was a typo, I meant 'The Forbidden Planet'.If possible please amend.Thanks."
4,Great vintage rendition of an H.G. Welles classic.,"Cult classic that I got wind of a little bit late. (early 80's on KTLA) Watching it today leaves me thinking ""they just don't make movies like this anymore..."""
5,My dad is like a teenager all over again.,My father loved watching these movies as a kid at the drive in and is excited every time I find another on DVD for him. Shipping was very fast and all DVD's in condition promised. Very pleased.
4,Good movie,"Good movie in spite of the hokey special effects. But, considering what they had to work with, it is very good."
5,Let's go ahead with our Time Machine,"What a great movie. Rod Taylor Takes HG Well's George the main charactor through time. He tries to find a better world. Yet as far as you can go things remain the same. The special effects for the 60's was great. HG Wells was showing how he felt about society. Making the rich useless Eloi and the working people doing the work the monster Morlocks. Just sit back and enjoy a fun movie with great actors that you can feel that they were the charactors from the book. This movie was charming, exciting and a true classic. See it."
5,An Excellant Science Fiction Classic,"A must have for lovers of H. G. Wells, or even Jules Vern, or classic Science Fiction movies. Well played, by the actors, and full of suspense. Believeable, and almost comical, as it may predict our furture. What will our post nuclear age be like, will we ever use the bomb again? What will be the results?Even a few flashes of the past, and somehow defines the future, as explained by the ""The Time Traveler"", or is it.Love Science Fiction, classic Science Fiction, then pick up a copy, pop some corn turn out the lights and prepare to be jolted, just a little."
1,"Q: I have a wonderful film, with great extras, yet...",...I have no image nor sound. What am I? A: A defective DVD. WB needs to get their freakin' act together and release better cases for their DVDs and insure quality in all releases. This disc tried to load for a while and stopped at 'No Play'. What fun!
1,Not the movie I expected,I ordered this movie thinking it was the one that I saw approximately 5 years ago. It was not I am passing it on to someone else. I was happy with the shipment time and price.I ended up finding the movie I was actually looking for called TIME MACHINE (2005?)I love Amazon but sometimes you have to really look at what you are ordering. I did not think to look at the information on the bottom of the page.
4,First rate movie,"Very interesting and well done. Really enjoyed the story, acting and cinematography."
5,this is a good movie,"I think this is one of the best movies of all times. H.G. Wells was a genius, very ahead of his time. Trust me, you'll have a great time watching this movie time and time again."
5,Awesome classic,"Classic telling of H.G. Wells's masterpiece. I would recommened this product to any fan of classic sci-fi. I do like the recent rendition, but will never beat the classic."
4,Pal at his Best,"A striking entry into the film mind of George Pal. Its the TIME proven tale of time travelers..with Rod Taylor in the lead. Pal is of course the unique guiding light in films like these and he doesnt dissapoint here. Rather, nice victorian touches are here with the casting of Alan Young who gives us the final line in the film.Well worth your TIME!!!"
5,This Version of The Time Machine is still the Best...,Maybe it's because I think of this version as the standard against which all other Time Machine movies must be compared.I just enjoy it. It was a great introduction to the idea of relativity for my 8th graders. They really got into it.
4,The Time Machine,Good special effects for the time it was produced. Kind of a melancholy story but well worth watching. In many ways better than the more recent interpretation of the novel.
5,Time Travel. Morlocks. Eloi. Love. What else do you want?,"You know something, the Eloi remind me of myself.They are disorientated, not knowing what the hell is going on, and just going places they just don't wanna go, but go, because they don't know that they don't want to go to that place they are going to!!! Read it again, it'll make sense.This movie is the best of the best when it comes to time travel flicks. George Pal couldn't have done a better book to film transfer. Music is eerie and Roddy taylor is perfect as the time traveller and is believable as a 19th century inventor.Watch the Documentary on DVD, it's presented by Roddy and is over 45mins long. A must watch.This is top of my list. A real gem. But I would still rather travel in time in a car, than a sofa chair, that looks like my grannys."
4,Time-less classic sci-fi that bears up to repeated viewing.,"Although quite different in tone and content from the original novel by H.G. Wells, George Pal's Oscar winner for Special Effects,The Time Machine convincingly conveys the wonder and mystery of time travel. Rod Taylor's highly believable and intense portrayal of the time traveler is a major strength of the film. Even though the special effects are ""dated"" and reveal at times the ""effects"" of low budget, they manage to hold up over repeated viewings much like Pal's The War of the Worlds. The Victorian atmosphere of The Time Machine is as vivid as the strangeness of the world in 802,701AD. In spite of its genre', the film manages to effectively portray the need for preserving our human-ness throughout time. If the obvious adherence to Hollywood comic book rescue/adventure and romance are given poetic license, the film is still very unique, entertaining, and worth having in one's film library."
5,One of the greatest films ever,"My title says it all.I don't care if I'm from The Matrix and Star Wars generation,I loved this movie alot more then the 2002 remake.I think George Pal was the Steven Spielberg of his time.It's a great masterpiece,Rod Taylor was perfect as the time travller and it was a total blast watching him go forward in time.In the remake it was a total of 10 minutes of him going though time and in the orgainal,it's about half and hour.So to the people of my generation,skip the remake and watch the Pal classic instead.***** out of *****"
3,A science fiction classic that needs a full screen edition!,"This is one of my favorite movies. Compared to the 2002 version, I personally feel that is the better one. Probably because it is the original. It is the kind of film that I like to see over and over again because it is so good. However, I do prefer watching movies in a full screen format. I would love to see another release of this film that offers a standard version. Since many DVDs are now being released in both standard and widescreen formats, I don't see why a full screen version is impossible. Hopefully I'll see one soon."
1,A Waste of Time,"As much as I want to love this movie - I've seen it several times - I just can't. As the story moves forward in time, I lose interest to the point that by the end of it, if still awake, I'm irritated."
2,Be Careful - doesnt' play in all DVD players!,This DVD will not play in some of the older DVD players - it is the first one we've bought out of 100 that is that way. On the box it says something about Dual Track format. Beware!
2,Maybe.,"goods: period setting, good charactersbads: unfaithful to the book's endingthe best version of this movie as of today, 2005overall: maybe"
5,Love it,This is the original movie as made during a time when special effects were almost non existent and acting and story line made up the difference. A great movie.
1,was not able to play,i got this for my dad and we were going to watch it and would not play on computer and 2 differnt dvd players .. do to it comming from a different country
5,The Time Machine,This movie is a great adventure. It has been enjoyed by my husband and i. Thank you Paula Flynn
4,See the Original First,"The George Pal version of this H.G. Wells classic is still a contender, though lacking the computor wizardry andspecial affects glitz of the 21st century version, I found thismovie to be entertaining and inspiring and highly recomend it toany true Science Fiction Fan."
3,For Christians only,"I love Lois Lenski's books.If you are not a Christian, as much as you will love the first 80 percent of the book and its wonderful depictions of the joys of winter, you will find yourself at a loss when Ms. Lenski brings up the baby Jesus. On subsequent pages you will learn that he is our King. If he is not your King you probably should steer clear of this book."
2,Falls short as a wireless security reference,"Wireless networking is the hottest technological innovation of the past few years, but the unpleasant fact is that security is its greatest weakness. In a crowded market of computer security titles, a niche exists for a book that lays out wireless security problems and couples them with solutions.Unfortunately, this is not that book. While well written, the book is thin on security matters; security is only first dealt with in chapter six. That coverage is interrupted by five chapters on building wireless networks. Discussion of security doesn't resume until chapter twelve.Despite its title, the book is more about setting up, configuring, and managing wireless networks, with occasional digressions into security issues. Only about 35 pages of this 320-page book directly deal with wireless security. The book would make a good introduction for designing wireless networks, but it falls short as a security reference."
3,Not All That Fake,"Simply Red sometimes surprises me when it comes to their music. Nevertheless, Mick Hucknall & company still can make a decent song, but not all the way enjoyable as they did before. Largely because of the drop of their popularity in the U.S. during the mid 90's. Arguably, there is no stopping them. Their latest single, Fake, the third from their Home album, doesn't seem to catch me right away. Although the song is alright, it really doesn't match their earlier songs such as If You Don't Know Me By Now, or Stars. Although the song has a little bit of a lively feel, similar to the horns of Chicago, it just isn't there. Fake is really a song that is in the middle. I only suggest you try to listen to it, if you're a die hard Simply Red fan."
2,I've rarely been more disappointed.,"The first two seasons of Veronica Mars were fantastic television. Then, the CW destroyed it. It's common knowledge that they wanted Rob Thomas to change up the formula of the show, and take away the season-long mystery, which was really the best part of the show. Add in a few annoying cookie-cutter California teen characters and you have a horrible 90210 melodrama that just happens to bear the Veronica Mars name. ""Liek omg is Logan and Veronica going to make up lol?"" becomes the basis for the whole show. The final episode of the series, however, is a wonderful return to quality, and is really the only thing I can recommend watching out of this season. Stick to the first two, and just pretend that this didn't happen."
5,BEST SHOWW,AMAZING SHOW! I was sooo easily hooked from the first episode I ever watched. SO very very impressed. Bravo! Well DOne
5,Completely Entertaining.....one of the best.,"My girlfriend and I started watching Veronica Mars on a 7 hour plane ride. Her sister (25 yrs) offered it to us about 4 hours into the flight. We watched it for the next 2 hours until our mac died. It sounds silly that we love this WB show so much, but seriously, we flew through season 1-3. We are both 23 and in law school (i know that bumps us down a few notches on everyone's cool radar) but seriously, you should really give it a try- I am sure you wont be disappointed. The characters are very well developed and you eventually learn to love them all. Do yourself a favor and buy this DVD- you can thank me later :)"
3,"Not as good as season 1&2, but I still love Veronica!",Definitely not as good as season 1 because it doesn't quite pull you in like Lilly's death did. Too bad the network had so much input into how the show runs. BUT Veronica is still smart and sassy. The dialogue is smart and witty and the characters are so damn lovable.
4,The show that died too soon,"Veronica Mars was an awesome show. I had to watch the first two seasons on DVD because I was UPN-less but it quickly became an all-time favorite. While the third season wasn't up to par with the first two, it was still better than a lot of what was on TV. And I still miss the show. I highly recommend it to anyone. It's not a teen show in the least--it's very unique."
3,Not as bad as the one-starrers are claiming...,"There is no doubt that this is the weakest season of the three. However, the first arc had some good moments, and the second arc was quite good. The stand-alone episodes mostly were bad. I still support buying this season on the off-chance it helps drive CW to renew the ""Veronica Fed"" version."
5,Veronica Mars - The Complete Third Season,I just love these crime and solve them TV series. A fantastic series which I have just brought Series one and two of.
1,The first season is better...,"I think it's kind of telling that the third season could barely pull two million viewers. A lot of the characters I enjoyed watching (Wallace, Weevil, Mac, Lamb, etc.) were relegated to appearing once every 6 episodes or so. Veronica's still snarky and bitter even though she's had no reason to be since Season 1. Jason Dohring puts in a performance as Veronica's doormat. All I can say for the third year is hey, the new opening credits looked nice, and maybe there are a good 3 or 4 episodes in the lot. Veronica might have been better off if it had been like Freaks & Geeks - brilliant but ended way too early after only one year. By the end of Season 3 it really was more like ""Why is this show still on the air?"""
1,severely upset over this purchase,"not only was the last disc cracked, but the third and fourth disc were missing!! someone went to to alot of trouble to make this disc set look new in a sealed package, what a scam!!"
1,And now for something completely different.,"The cast of this show are surrounded by Gumbies, and knights who say ""Neeh"", and the Lumberjacks who sing the Lumberjack song. Yes, I am saying Monty Python's Flying Circus has more laughs and talent then this brainless show."
4,Great Show!,"This was a great show, but it got cancelled. There's sort of a cliffhanger ending that leaves you highly annoyed that they never picked it back up. Oh well."
4,Not as good as 1 and 2 but...,"I thought the 1st and 2nd season of Veronica Mars were amazing. The third season was good, but there were some things I did not like, especially being a Logan/Veronica fan. The mysteries seemed less personal for the most part, unlike the first two seasons, (with Lilys murder, Logans parents, Duncan, etc.) The cast has new characters, some of which I like, some I didn't. But all in all, its still Veronica Mars, and I love the show. Dvds have some good extras on it, and an interesting ""season 4 promo"" that actually made me glad Veronica Mars was not picked up for season 4. :)"
5,Mars is Magic,"The complexity of a multitude of simple puzzles overlaid on the larger darker mystery, the versatility of Kristen Bell's acting and the strength of the cast makes this a series well worth watching. One of my favourites."
4,Veronica Mars - The Complete Third Season,I watched this series when it was on tv and that waas why I wanted to buy it. It was fun and kind of suspenseful to know that a teenager can solve crimes/problems.
5,I LOVE V. MARS,"So as you can tell from the title I""m a huge V. Mars fan. The main question is why aren't you? Season 3 has more snappy comebacks, more edgy plot lines , and more adultish situations. By no means is Veronica a push over but there are situations where she is ""put in her place"" in a more adult sense than when she was in High School. All in all the third season is both more and less realistic. In both cases however it is totally awesome and in my opinion better than the first two seasons in the show has progressed to this point naturally. Someone should slap the faces of every WB exec who voted to cancel this show it was really beginning to come into it's own. Anyone who liked the girl let cast of Buffy and other such shows should be watching Veronica Mars!"
5,Absolutely Fantastic,"They could revive the magic of the first season with proud, elevating the level of the dialogs. The drama's are more mature. The investigation, more realistic. The acting, superb. When you can make these items be together in such a nice way, there's a fantastic story. Too bad that it got cancelled, but I'm proud to be able to have these pieces of art, which surely cannot be replaced."
3,Disappointing season,"Don't get me wrong, I still loved the season overall, but compared to the first two it just didn't stand up. I'm a big Logan fan and the fact she hooks up with others in the show just didn't fly for me. Also the series finale was so disappointing, too many things left unsaid and unanswered.I know the writers were hoping for a renewal and that is why they went with a season finale episode and not a series finale. But the revamped version for a possible season four was fun to see in the special features.It's not the best season, but it's still great since it's all Veronica, baby!"
5,very good,i love the veronica mars series. i wish there was more to it. it was one of the best series made. you can't go wrong watching it. season three was beyond my imagation.
4,Veronica Mars: The Complete Third Season,"As much as I love Veronica Mars, I was rather disappointed in the way the series ended. I want to know what happens with Veronica and Logan, or how bad the Sheriff's election was. These questions were never answered. I did, however, enjoy the season 4 preview. Too bad the season never aired."
3,"Two great seasons, one not so much!","I loved this show when it came out. I thought it was really different and the players were deep and you loved getting to know them. We were led on a journey to find out what made them tick. In season three the characters changed in ways that were not very flattering or developed. I am not sure if it was the change of network or a downward spiral in writing, but the third season left behind reason and never looked back. I spent most of season three wanting to put Veronica on ""time out"" and shaking my head at Logan. These characters deserved more. Like any good show you have to ride the wave to the end and there were some really good moments, but the writers lost touch with what made us fall in love with these people and introduced new people not worth knowing. If you get this season on sale it is worth buying!"
5,veronica mars,i was extremely happy with the playback quality of this dvd set. there have been times were recent purchases have skipped or had other issues.... this was exactly what i had hoped it would be
5,"Even with network interference, it's still an awesome show","There's a reason why Season 3 is so different... it's the CW's fault. They dumbed it down for their target demographic (full of girls who are too busy gossiping about the latest episode of Laguna Beach) And now they cancelled it.This show was too good for The CW. It really should've been on another network + more advertising. It's still a great show though, Kristen Bell puts her heart & soul into every scene."
3,The end of Mars.,"Veronica Mars - The Complete Third Season is pretty much a mixed bag. This was the last season of this cult classic and I can understand why this show was cancelled. Kristen Bell who plays Veronica Mars is a good actress but the plotlines and glossy writing is too much. The characters were one-demensional and artifical. Stick with the first two seasons instead, season three was a snoozefest."
5,Cancelled too soon!!!,"This was the best series on TV and watching the trailer for season 4 that was rejected breaks my heart. What a cool show it would've been having Veronica as an FBI agent. While its hard to top the 1st season's perfection, season 3 was great. Veronica will live on in my repeated viewings of my 3 season dvd collection!"
5,Worth it for the bonus features,"For all the VM fans out there, it is very bittersweet to watch the (extensive) bonus materials included in the VM season 3 dvd. There is a season 4 pitch (about 10-15 mins), but it was just enough to get me salivating for more. Then I realized the CW is a bunch of morons and there will be no more.Anyway, for VM first-timers - you will enjoy this DVD, but, I highly recommend picking up seasons 1&2 first. You won't be disappointed."
1,Save your money for Seasons One and Two,"WhileVeronica Mars - The Complete First SeasonandVeronica Mars - The Complete Second Seasonare some the finest television produced in the last twenty years, the third season is so bad that it's almost like watching a different series. Some characters go so far over the top and out of character that they're unrecognizable while others fade into the background as pale, unentertaining shells of their former selves. The storylines are weak and cliched, some even offensive in their treatment of rape and social issues. I recommend you skip season three and save your money for seasons one and two. Season one especially stands out for its top-notch writing, excellent ensemble cast, and gripping plot. I still try to get everyone I meet to watch season one. I do my best to stop them from even knowing season three exists."
1,Season 3 -worst of the lot,"For fans of the previous seasons, season 3 leaves a lot to be desired--a whole lot. The once outcast Veronica is now the apple of everyone's eye. The once charismatic Logan is whipped. The once best.father.ever Keith now trades creepily sexual banter with his daughter. The once intriguing plot lines are now reduced to entitled Veronica all the time. What happpened to the ensemble cast? The funny, snarky dialog? The emotional intensity? The sharply drawn sense of place? That's what I want to know because it certainly is not here in Season 3."
4,well researched read,"For this newly pregnant health educator, this was a nice, solid read on this topic. Paget does a good job establishing herself as a resource (including that she conducted an online survey of 100 or so couples) and she incorporates expert and interviewee (preggies and their male partners) comments really well throughout. Her info is solid and intelligent, but... I wasn't blown away by it. I found her tone a bit on the stuffy side, and even a bit of a downer in parts, e.g., she actually goes after ""frumpy"" preggies. Paget does ack. the downers that can come along w/ pregnancy and she doesn't always try to give advice that helps lovers to deal beyond decent fashion advice. In hoping for something that would live up to its title, my husband and I were a bit disappointed overall."
3,For the stuffier gal.... Not the HOT mama,"This book, while well-informed and easy to read, is a bit stuffy for my taste. If you can't handle ""Your Orgasmic Pregnancy: Little Sex Secrets Every Hot Mama Should"" know because you're offended by frank talk and womanly wit, this is the book for you!However, I daresay, that the voice in this book is hardly 'hot mama'-ish. It reminds me more of my grandmother's era, no offense, Lou. Good intentions don't always have the best result.The title is misleading at best."
5,Best of Class,".If you only own one home repair book make it this one. No one book can cover all home repair projects thoroughly but, this is about as close as it gets. I owned and used the first edition for 20 years."
4,Great.,This book is full of information. Love it. Shipped immediately and received in few days. Would recommend. Great handyman book. We used to build our home.
3,Not the best out there for REPAIRS,"I have this book and think it's GREAT for projects that you're doing from scratch (like replacing bathroom fixtures), but it's NOT a great Home Repair manual -- there are a lot of minor tasks that go virtually unnoticed and undescribed (like re-caulking bathroom fixtures). A good book to have in your home reference library, but definitely not my first choice!"
4,Excellent reference,"This book is a great reference for the ""Do it yourself"" crowd. The one thing I think it lacks is great illustrations, but what they do have is adequate. I'd honestly suggest getting another book, like the one by Black & Decker, to supplement this one, but this will help you quite a bit with any projects, even by itself."
3,Alphabet problems,"Overall, considering myself a beginner-intermediate level speaker, this program lends itself to learning Polish at a good pace. However, I'm experiencing software glitches with the Alphabet section. When clicking on some of the letters, it seems to hiccup and not translate right away. Some letters it works normal, but others it's frustrating. If it worked properly, this software would have received a 4-star."
2,"India, It's Life and Thoughts","A negative review of the Religions of India during th Colonial Period. Very dated. Author is very negative of all local religions as well as other, than his, Christian Religions. He does not understand why his religion has not flurrished. It is hard to sell your product when you start off insulting their Culture."
2,Not like to old affinity revo,"I thought I was getting the old affinity 56 wedge but when it arrived I could see from the finish that it wasn't the right one. It didn't feel or perform like the other 2 wedges I own, the 60 and 52. it was a waste of money for me."
3,1000 series not all the same,"You may get the impression that a cartidge labeled for LaserJet 1000, 1200, 1220, and 3300, should work with all the 1000 series of laserjet printers. Unfortunately that's not true and this toner does not work with the 1012 or 1020 laserjet printers."
2,Never received the item. Got a response from vendor though,"I am sorry to say I wanted to buy this toner because it was fifty dollars less than Office Depot. It never came and my emails to the vendor and to Amazon have yet to be answered. I had to shell out eighty dollars for toner today after waiting desperately from day to day hoping my old toner would last. It has been about a month now. Oh well. UPDATE I did receive a nice response from the vendor ultimately, offering to rectify the problem."
1,WARNING -- THESE ARE EXPIRED CARTRIDGES,"Although advertised as ""new"" and ""original"" and were bought directly from Amazon, both cartridges I received were past their expiration date. Additionally, one of the cartridge boxes itself was damaged even though the Amazon shipping box itself was not.This is first time I had this experience with Amazon. From another customer comment dated October 2009, Amazon appears not to care about disclosing this on in its web site advertisement."
5,Excellent value for money,"If you want to have cost effective evidenced based printing...then this is the cartridge for you. Crisp, clean, clear every time.Excellent quality and at 1200 dpi nobody complains!Here's a tip:buy two! I did!"
2,Not Good,"I purchased the print cartrige thinking I would get a better deal verses going to a office supply store. The print cartridge delivery time was prompt, but the cartridge produce streaks on the paper upon printing. I notified the seller and had to do a second notice. The sellar apologize stating that they were out of town and he also stated that he never had a problem with the cartridges before. I return the cartridge and the money was return promptly."
2,Toner Cartridge Faulty,"The cartridge arrived on time, and in the retail packaging, but the product looked old, and did not work as intended. Instead, it bled all over print-outs, and no amount of clearing, or cleaning did any good. Since I was in a time crunch, I had to run out and buy another toner cartridge (at full retail price) to replace the faulty one I'd ordered. Not a happy camper at this point."
2,HP Repacement Printing Cartridge,"Product started off with streaks and blotches. I cleand roller a couple of times before it cleared up. I would not buy again, I would pay the extra $20 at Staples. How do you return a product that you have constantly in use, albeit with poor performance?"
4,Vendor did not respond to my e-mail,Ink cartridge appears to be fine.With the cartridge came a small pamphlet on how to return the old cartridge by mail.The only problem was that the instructions pertained to Japan and three European countries. Nothing that pertained to the US.I wrote to the vendor twice without a reply.
3,HP LaserJet 15A Black Print Cartridge in Retail Packaging,"The ink was mainly for coupons and some things I do for my sons school. When I first bought it it was printing super light so I contacted the seller and he told me to shake it because sometimes it settles if it sits to long. I shook it and it really didn't help, then I shook it again a week later and still didn't help. After I kept printing ALOT it's now printing a bit darker. The seller did tell me I could return it for a full refund but I really need the ink so I'm dealing with it printing light."
1,Defective product,"Not sure what was wrong with the cartridge, but it was completely useless -- basically, it produced an entirely black page. I've bought literally dozens of HP cartridges in the past, from other sellers, and never had any problems before."
4,Movie is 1080i,This Blu-ray release is imported from Canada and is a Region 1 release so it will play fine on all North American Blu-ray players. The downside is the movie is in 1080i and not 1080p. Dts hd master audio sound is great. But no special features. No U.S. release date yet.
4,An Awesome Beginning!!!,"I love prequels because you get to see how it all started! This is an awesome prequel because you see how Leatherface was born, you see how he gets his chainsaw, how he started wearing other people's faces, and more. I love the gore scenes. Two brothers, Eric and Dean are going to fight in the Vietnam war, but Dean is reluctant and wants to stay with his smokin' hot girlfriend. They run into trouble with Sheriff Hoyt and must deal with Leatherface! If you love prequels, horror, gore, and Leatherface, you'll love THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE: THE BEGINNING!!!p.s. Happy Presidents Day!"
4,Definatley a shocker,"The prequal to the remake, I thought it couldn't get any gorier, but I was wrong. This movie is disturbing at many times, not just the gore but, how real it is. This film is definatley NOT a kids movie (OBVIOUSLY). To be truthfull you will probably like this film if you like the original and/or the remake, not as much as the 74' classic but, it's still good."
3,Key Point: Don't Turn Your Back on a Chainsaw...!,"The victims in this movie are idiots! If you are in strange surroundings and you know that there are people there that definitely mean you HARM then it's best to constantly look around in a paranoid fashion, because someone IS trying to KILL YOU! If you are fortunate enough to escape: 1. Hide as best you can. 2. Obtain the most LETHAL weapon you can while hiding. 3. Don't hesitate to kill everyone you come in contact with that is not your friend! I know this is just a movie but I hate it when people die becasue they are stupid or they don't have the will to fight. Sometimes you will have to fight to live. Very simple choice.Very gory movie. I want to see a movie where people are actually FIGHTING to live...."
5,"A beginning to a great ""factual"" story","I liked this movie because it put a beginning to the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. This was a great story with the original actors of the movie was released a few years ago. This movie told the story that brought Leatherface to the place of when he started killing and why he started to kill. I never did figure out why the whole community in that area protected Leatherface, but since seeing this movie I can finally put it together. This movie is a complete horror/gore fest for all of those people that enjoy it. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that loves the Texas Chainsaw Massacre stories!!!!"
5,Accurate Portrayal,"I really enjoyed The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning. I recently visited Texas, so when I came home and watched this movie, I was really taken by the history of this amazing state. I never realized that one of the most famous historical figures of Texas, Thomas Hewitt, was actually born in a meat-packing plant! Learning all about his family life was really something else. It really warms my heart to think about how despite such rough beginnings and facial deformities, one can still make something of themselves. I've watched my copy of this DVD about 11 times and I think I will have to watch it again tonight. Kudos to the filmmakers for creating such a breathtakingly accurate portrayal of the history of the Lone-Star State."
4,Brutal and beautiful,"TCMTB is one of the most brutal movies I've seen, and by that I mean brutal in a good way. I've seen worse violence on film, but yet this movie strikes me as more hardcore than most horror movies. I'm not a fan of movies like Cannibal Hollocost and Ginniepig, but I like my horror and gore, and The Beginning is right up my alley. With the beautiful photography combined with gruesome actions and terrifying soundtrack, The Beginning stands out as one of my favorite slashers of all time. I'm pushing it a bit, but I would go as far as calling it an instant classic....That said, I'm really tired at the moment, and maybe I would feel different after a couple of hours sleep...But as you might figured... I really loved this film.... :)"
2,Pointless prequel,"I went into this movie REALLY wanting to like it. I am a huge fan of the TCM franchise. This film just did not do it for me on any level. There was no character that I liked, zero nudity, no suspense, not really any scares, and the gore is virtually off screen all the time. We don't learn anything about any of the characters. We do not see anything we have not seen before. The house is not even that creepy. It was much freakier in all the other films. In this version, it seems more like a flop house for freaks than a freaky house. There are no chicken bone windchimes or anything cool like that. There is nothing odd or imaginative added to the franchise with the addition of this film. The director seems to be just connecting the dots here. It amazes me to read all these reviews that are stating this is super gross, scary, or ""surreal."" What? This is a nail in the coffin for TCM. No mas. Please. MTV directors have no business going here. Stop the madness."
2,A Clumsy Flashback,"The scenario is a clumsy effort to connent this movie to the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie which should take place 4 years after the event in this movie. It's a flat movie with no words to say. AND I think you could buy this DVD as low as 1.00$ used or new after it's release.Texas chainsaw massacre (1973) - A Masterpiese in Acting, not horrorTexas chainsaw massacre 2 (1985) - A Very good 80s horror movieTexas chainsaw massacre 3 (1990) - A Very good sequel with some new words to sayTexas Chainsaw Massacre : Next Generation - Don't waste your time!Texas chainsaw massacre (Remake)(2003) - A Masterpiese in remaking, far better than the original as a horror movie and really EnjoyableTexas Chainsaw Massacre : The Beginning (2006) - A Masterpiese in ruining the entire series from the beginning!"
3,Pretty Good!,"I have to say I really enjoyed this movie. It does a great job in explaining alot of things. This movie is very GOREY which I Love, if you've not seen it and like the re-make you'll love this one."
2,lame money maker,"This new verison of TTC was very lame and not wrost 18 dollars for it. Maybe when only 10 or less it be wrost it. The first and remake were not believeable either, but this one just dumb. i was very dispointed with it and i say rent it if you must, but do not buy until really cheat."
1,Depressing With No Redeeming Qualities,Simply read the other one star reviews and that will sum up my feelings about this piece of trash. I watched this on cable and it is just another example of how the horror genre has gone totally wrong.
4,awesome,this movie is good i definetly gonna buy it the reason that i did not give 5 stars is because it looks alot like the remake but not so good and its more about sneaking around than running scared like the remake
2,Please enter a title for your review,"Although it started slow the second quarter started picking up steam but the second half is a waste of film. Exhibit A in the case of the horror genre being populated solely by lazy genre-loyalist writers and directors who wouldn't know a creative idea if it disemboweled them. I spent half the movie willing it to get to the point and half the time when it did wondering what the point was. Boring sterile conventional suspense and climax, no plot points or characters to wonder about, no chance of anything coming out of leftfield, it just sets a tone and hammers and drones away at it. No big things needed to be changed to improve the film, it's just the little things that weren't there to hold your interest and make it worth watching, no attention to detail. They've got a perfectly functional skeletal plot outline for a movie, they just needed to let some creative writers do something with it before it was ready for filming."
1,I'd give it zero if I could...,"What a total piece of trash. There really isn't much to be said for this film. The prior remake from 2003 wasn't exactly great filmmaking, but at least it did what a horror film was supposed to do: it scared the audience, gave you some characters to root for, and created a whole lot of supsense. This film does none of those things. Walking out of the theater, the only word I could think to describe the film was pointless. If you thought other horror films had nihilistic endings, just wait to experience this. Oh wait, don't experience it. Don't mistakenly give this film any money like I did. It will only encourage the studios to keep adding on unnecessary installments to once-respected horror franchises from 30 years ago. This film is a travesty and a disgrace to the amazing movie that was made back in 1974. I'm shocked that Tobe Hooper and Kim Henkel would even attach their names to this drivel."
4,another swell performance by r. Lee Ermey delivers the bads,if you really enjoyed the brutal remake to Tobe's original film you're probably gonna dig this prequel . i only detracted one star as we do not get a Ms. Bile ending . just the filmakers choice . i respect that . i think both young directors do an excellent job of scaring the hell out of the audience . i can kind of understand the older viewers cleaving to their 1970's baby . i'm that way when it comes to a lot of films as i was born in 63' and resist a lot of the modernizations in filmaking . these films are of the horror genre though . i see their redux's as a good thing precisely because they can show a lot more of the grue and spatter . they're better photographed . i'd have prefered a more up ending . that may well have been untrue to this very hostile vision . yet again r. Lee Ermey absolutely steals the show as the head of household .
2,The remake of the first one was better then this,"I wanted to love this movie so much since i LOVED the remake of TCM.but this...i cant explain what happened.sure theres lots of blood and gore but something was missing...oh yeah,any form of entertainment.this movie has alot of boring parts and lags alot.the kills are great dont get me wrong but the movie just feels way different.watch the remake of TCM and youll see what i mean.R.Lee Emery steals this whole movie and hes the only reason besides the gore to watch this movie.i would say to rent this one or if you must own it buy it used from someone on amazon but DONT pay more then five dollers for it trust me youll feel riped off."
3,depends on how you look at it,if you look at it as a stand alone movie its awesome action packed and has its share of scare moments.if you look at it as a fan of the orginal its just a different view of itno granpa in it and they make old leatherface be disfigured and bullied as a kid and thats why he snaps and kills people.personally i prefered that he just killed to kill made him much scarier
5,The goriest TCM film since part 2!,"When it comes to slasher films both old and new, its all a matter of love or hate it. this is a film strictly for those who aren't afraid of a good ""blood feast"". The Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Begging is just that, it tells the origins of the 2003 Leatherface and his deranged family. Who they where, what they where like before they became cannibals,and even the birth of Leatherface and how he got his chainsaw and namesake ""leather-FACE."" this film has what the 1974 film couldn't and didn't have, gore. torture, people being quartered, faces getting sliced off, and quite posibly the goriest chainsaw deaths (though there are only 3) since TCM part 2. (1986)[ASIN:B000I2J68M The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (The Gruesome Edition)]] so ONLY if you're a fan of slasher or the gore films like saw and hostel.its worth a view, otherwise skip it because its not for the faint of heart or those who like horror films that don't need the gore."
3,"more gore, less substance","very brutal, very bloody, very illthe film never reaches the subtle horror of the original tcm or even the 2003 sequel.Instead of that you are served a true cannibalistic slaughter.Fans of gore-movies will surely be satisfied.The movie does not really keep the promise of revealing the origins of the hewitt family. The plot is too simple...If you like blood buy the unrated version of this movie.If you want to be thrilled and be afraid, keep looking for the original."
1,"Don't fund this movie, even though my stupid self did....","Please do not go and see this movie. It's just another sequel/prequel that companies just pump out at audiences so they can make easy money. This movie is just not good....at all. It isn't scary, nor does it have a sensable plot. There is a fair amount of violence but even that didn't save me from turning my attention to the pizza i snuck into the theatre to eat. I like movies with senseless slaughter, such as the Friday the 13th series. Those movies are extremely fun to watch. I cannot say the same for this crap-fest. Just save your money people, and go buy some cheeseburgers."
4,"Coldsmith, Master Storyteller","Don Coldsmith's writing and stories take you with the Elk-dog band of the people on what seems like real life day to day living in the 1400 - 1500's. To my knowledge his facts are accurate historically, which is why I began reading the series. His characters are very realistic and 3 dimentional. I recommend this series to anyone of any age."
2,Not very good poses,"The model is beautiful but the poses are not very useable at all from an artist standpoint. They are very awkward and unnatural poses. I was looking for something more classical, some seated or standing back poses. I'll be returning the book. ""The Nude Female Figure: A Visual Reference for the Artist"" and ""The Beginner's Guide to Photographing Nudes"" were much more useful for what I was looking for as an artist."
1,"Say ""cheese"" cake","I ordered this book because of the glowing reviews. Even the review that was negative sited ""faults"" that I view as pluses. I returned this book as soon as it arrived because I found the poses to be cliched cheese cake for the most part."
5,Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!,"This is the perfect book for people who are trying to achieve some semblance of fluency in Spanish who have not had the opportunity of living in-country for any substantial period of time. I'm so grateful for this book, the author is to be applauded for producing one of the most useful books ever written on learning Spanish. A MUST HAVE for every student of Spanish. PLEASE do yourself the favor of owning this book."
5,Fun improving your Spanish,"This is a witty and cleverly conceived book to help the reader take the important step up from ""beginner"" to ""intermediate"". It is divided into 14 chapters which deal with Spanish linguistic issues, as well as manners and culture. Two of the chapters at the beginning deal with different usage of verbs and words which are similar in English and Spanish but have different usage (and meaning), underlining the possible (and frequent), pitfalls. Others deal with tenses, various expressions, conjugation (with focus on irregular verbs), and there is even a chapter on slang and obscene words and expressions!!It is fun to read and to learn from. I highly recommend it to intermediates in Spanich."
4,I agree with the crowd,"Essential for sounding natural while speaking with native Spanish-speakers. I am still just a beginner, but already it has helped me, and I know that I will be able to re-read this book at least twice more as I progress and get more out of it each time. A bargain for anyone really trying to learn the language."
5,I would give this book 10 stars if could,"I actually bought this book a couple of years ago and it has not only helped me with my Spanish major but I have also gained knowledge that one cannot find in common textbooks. Because of my studies, I can say that I have probably, 60 Spanish books (some texts, some novels) and this one it one of the best, if not the best I have."
5,Good both ways,"I am a native spanish speaker and I got this book for my boyfriend who is learning spanish. Sometimes I find it difficult to explain the logic behind things that are second nature for me but this book does it very nicely and from the point of view of an english speaker! I think it is great and believe it or not, he is learning real-life spanish and I am learning a lot of english!"
3,Book for Spanish beginners,Nice book for somebody who has already got the basic knowledge of Spanish. There is lack of grammar explanation rules and exercises.
2,disappointed,"This book didn't increase my vocabulary or make me feel more confident in my spanish speaking ablilities. It can help improve how you communicate the spanish you already know. It doesn't help you learn knew words, and only helps you learn some general sayings and help with words you choose to say depending on who you are talking to. It's very long and boring, worst of all he explains almost everything in English! How can I build on my spanish if all I'm reading for the most part is English? I've read many spanish books and I must say it's more boring then any other book I've read thus far! Which I know is opposite of other posts I've read. weird. One example the book gives is for the word adios! I think everyone has a general idea of when to say adios and in what context after begginners spanish. Wish I didn't waste my ten bucks on this book:("
3,Somewhat useful,"I bought this book thinking it would help me improve upon my basic Spanish skills. What I found this book focuses on are merely helpful words and phrases that I did find somewhat effective. However, if you're looking for a book to take you to a level of intermediate Spanish, this is not the one."
3,NOT AS EASY AS IT SOUNDS,Good book but not as easy as it sounds. You are going to have to put in time and effort.
4,Good but Lacks the Depth of Behind the Wheel Spanish,"Keenan's book is good. Especially for gringos or 'gringas' like me.That is the strong point of the book.The weak points are obvious. Incomplete in every way, from idioms to adequate presentation of the past, present and future tenses. The book is 'good' not 'great'.I recommend you buy this book and use it. It would be an invaluable but incomplete asset in your learning Spanish arsenal.If you really want to learn to speak the language and want a comprehensive and easy to learn from complete text on Spanish complete with translations and answer keys, I would have to recommend you buy Behind the Wheel Spanish with 8 CDs and the book.Awesome and practical.I have used both Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish and Behind the Wheel.But for me, Breaking Out of Beginner's Spanish is the backup.Behind the Wheel is the main course."
1,98% is in English - Don't expect to learn the Spanish language with this book!,"Do you want to learn the ""Spanish Language"" in ""English""? 98% of the book is in English, it is just informative, like a dictionary type but with slang. Info could be helpful but you won't learn the Spanish Language!!!!"
1,Absolutely Useless,"This book might be good for people who already have learned some Spanish, but is completely useless for someone, like myself, who just start learning Spanish. So disappointing."
5,Enjoyable.,Of course I jumped right to the dirty words and their uses. I loved it! Such insight on how different cultures who speak Spanish use the language. There should be a book like this for English learners or users too!
5,excellente!!!,"I absolutely love this book! Who would have thought a required text for school could be funny?! Chapter three ""tricksters"" or false cognates is vital for those unfamiliar with the nuances of he language. I knew most of them but it is always good to rewiew. I highly reccomend this for anyone interested in improving their Spanish."
5,One of the best in my collection,I recently purchased this book because of the enthusiastic customer reviews on this site and am so pleased with it that I feel obliged to add my comments. I own several shelves of language books for several different languages and I believe Keenan's is easily one of the most useful and useable for someone who has the basics of the language. The fact that it is also a delight to read puts it almost in a class by itself.
2,poor quality but still useful,"I must agree that one could do a *much* better job of making a cd-rom for learning dutch (or the other languages). There's no systematic teaching of sentence structure, grammar rules, etc. - it's very poorly designed as a ""language course"". Also, the program (I'm using the Mac version) is many years old, and hasn't been updated for OS X. The sound and video are low-resolution and grainy.On the other hand, I do find it useful, if only because a cd-rom is a better tool for practicing than a cassette tape. You can easily skip around the texts, click on individual words or whole sentences to hear them, see the (not always helpful) translation, etc. - so I would say that in conjunction with a *real* language course (maybe a good book) this could be helpful for extra practice. But ideally I would like to find a good-quality cd-rom language course. Anyone know of one?"
5,Learn Dutch Now! 9.0,I like this CD Learn Dutch Now it's helping me to remember mynative language. Thank you for writting it . Regards Aleida Ray
2,Cheap Materials and Construction,"The 'Lingerie Cage' does everything as advertised, but the product is made with cheap and flimsy material, and I can already tell that it will have a short life. After the first wash, I noticed a small rip/tear in the mesh material by the zipper. I'm not sure if it was there before I threw it in the washer, or if it ripped while it was tumbling around in the delicate cycle, but I'm not a fan."
2,Cups dented,"I've been using this for over a year, and it has held up. My bras are shaped for nipple concealment, and I've learned to put the underwires in vertically; this keeps the whole thing from flattening as much. The round ends hold their shape, but there are no bones to keep the cylinder from going to the tuna-can profile. The bras are clean, but I had hoped it would preserve the shape of the cups better."
3,Nothing fancy but it works,"It works just fine, but I'd prefer if there was a way to truly secure your harddrive inside it. As it stands it's just kind of sliding around in there, held in place by the small enclosure. Works just fine, and the aluminum does a good job of dissipating heat (expect it to get warm)."
3,Discoverers and explorers,The stories are very interesting but a bit short and end rather abruptly. A little more information about the explorers would help.
3,Good read but innacurate,"This book is a quick entertaining and informative read about the main explorers of the Americas. However you have to keep in mind that this book was written almost 100 years ago so a lot of the information may be inaccurate. As an example, none of the stories about the Conquistadors mention anything about diseases having to do with the death of whole civilizations.That said it is still a fun read. It would be good as a starting point to learn the basics about the main explorers but if you want to get detailed and accurate you would need to download another book.The formatting is good for a free book."
4,Makes cute cookies!,"After trying the Heart Molds similar to this product, I decided to try the Easter Bunny ones for a party. I did not use sticks for my sugar cookies and found they worked fine. Once again I found that the suggested cooling was is a bit low, suggesting 5 minutes. They are just to soft to get out of the pan at this point, so I wait at least 10 minutes.My only real difficulty was that it was very difficult to see the facial imprints on the cooked cookies. I thought that I had pushed the dough into the mold pretty well but some of them came out with marks you could hardly see at all. Not a big deal, because you can pretty much decide where you want your own eyes etc anyway.I made some heavily decorated with frosting and some that just had their eyes, nose and mouth. My guests loved both!"
5,Freedom Suite: The Courageous Commentary,"The Rascals were always at the forefront of social issues. The fractious tone of American society in the late 60's had some people denying that America was on the brink of political and moral decay, but the courageous ones knew that things were going awfully wrong and The Rascals clearly reflected on and exposed the violence, bigotry, and intolerance of the nation at the time. Just listen to ""Look Around"" and you can get a clear picture of American society in flux. Freedom Suite is a great time capsule, a primary source delving into America at the crossroads in a time of uncertainty and confusion. A great album and statement."
3,Not what I expected,"Perhaps I did not read the description very well, but I thought I was getting a book about purple arrangements of flowers. I was surprised to see it was stationary when it arrived."
2,Orlando,"That's the second VW book for me to read (the first being the excellent to the light house )In orlando i must say i found myself feeling the worse thing you can experience with a book : struggling to finish it !That's not due to the fact that it is poorly written ,no... on the contrary but i didn't like the idea of the book !I mean ,VW gives me the feeling that she is an angry person and reflecting her anger on unending pages , it left me with the feeling that if she was a Man she would have written that book anyway but this time critsizing her gender"
4,Very funny,"This book is magical and absolutely hilarious. Okay, so it takes a certain sense of humor to really enjoy it, but if a satire on writing throughout the ages sounds like fun to you, you'll probably enjoy it. Orlando is more than that though, it really has many levels to it, and it is even more interesting when you read the story behind the story, about Vita and Virginia's love affair. I learned about all that stuff while researching for a 15 page paper on the book. Getting a little to much Orlando due to that paper made me lower my rating from five to four stars. It is fun and liberating. Oh, warning: it has a very odd ending. I'm not sure I'll ever understand it. I read it before I finished the book and thought, oh, It will probably make sense after I've read everything in between. Nope. But it was definitely worth the read."
3,Milord! Milady!,"This `roman à clés' is very original. The hero continues to live in different historical periods and undergoes a sex change.However, it is written in an emotional, sentimental, superlative style: `society in the reign of Queen Anne was of unparalleled brilliance. The graces were supreme.'Except for the first period, there are no conflicts, only rather superficial descriptions of the mood and spirits of the times. For V. Woolf, `to give a truthful account of society ... only those who have little need of the truth, and no respect for it - the poets and novelists - can be trusted to do it, for this is one of the causes where the truth does not exist.'`Orlando' is a perfect flight from reality: `But let other pens treat of sex and sexuality; we quit such odious subjects as soon as we can.' `Whigs and Tories, Liberal party and Labour party ... should be left to the historian.'This book is a clean, introvert, aristocratic, long ode to pure Beauty.Only for Virginia Woolf fans."
5,Extraordinary,"Orlando is, quite simply, an extraordinary, even visionary book. Much has been written about the startlingly experimental nature of the book's treatment of its hero/heroine. Especially for its time, Woolf's daring literary gambit puts this novel head and shoulders above most others.But her writing, more than any experimenting, is what endeared this book to me in the first place, and continues to do so. From the opening passages in which young Orlando engages in fencing practice with the decapitated head of a Moor, to the incredible descriptions of the ice-bound Thames finally thawing and carrying away with it the multitudes who have encamped on its frozen surface, Orlando weaves a hypnotic spell that lingers long after the reader has closed its covers."
4,hilarious!,"We had to read ""To the Lighthouse"" in high school, and based on that book, I thought Virginia Woolf was a chore. I still hate ""To the Lighthouse."" But ""Orlando"" is fun, carefree, and witty. I recommend it to anyone who thinks that Woolf is impossible."
5,Man and Woman,"Woolf's skill of imagery in writing is amazing. Her love of her character Orlando is apparent in the gentle way she carries him/her from the 15th century to 1928. I wanted to jump into the story, sit beside Orlando, ride a horse beside him, and kiss him as a man and then again as a woman. A stunning read and one that should be on any well-read person's read and read again list...enjoy."
5,This book isn't just about baseball,"After plowing through more than two dozen reviews that say this is the best baseball book ever written, you might be inclined to dismiss those sentiments as the worst example of hype. Don't. You will be the loser for it.This book is superb for its baseball stories, but it is more than that. The men in its pages talk about what it was like to be young and alive in America at the turn of the century. You don't even have to LIKE baseball to enjoy this book, but it certainly helps.Jacques Barzun has said that someone who wants to understand America must learn baseball. In the movie ""Field of Dreams,"" James Earl Jones says, the one constant in America has been baseball. To understand what they're talking about, you must buy and read this book. And you'll enjoy yourself while doing so."
4,The best sound of summer,It is such a pleasure to listen to men who really loved what they did for a living. Wayne Gretzky said he would miss his teammates the most. These interviews prove his point. They spend so much time talking about their teammates and opponents they don't spend much time talking about themselves. One question did they all get together to agree on what to say about Ty Cobb and Christy Mathewson?
2,DISAPOINTED,HE MADE HIS SELF SOUND LIKE HE WAS THE PERSON IN THE STORY IT WAS TOO PHONY JUST MY VIEW
3,A Missed Opportunity,"While Ritter has deservedly received a great deal of credit for this groundbreaking book, being the first person to committ ballplayers from the early part of this century to tape and then present transcripts of those conversations, the great tragedy of this book in its various incarnations are the questions and topics that didn't get asked and were left unexplored. Had Ritter only known more about the history of the game and the careers of individual players at the time, he had an umatched opportunity to get right to the heart of the matter on any number of issues. But he spoke to them as a fan, and it shows. In the end the book teeters more toward nostalgia than hard core history. While it gives a wonderful sense of the times and of the personality of the players interviewed, one is left wishing for more and mourning the lost opportunity as most of these men have since passed on."
5,One of the most important baseball books ever written,I read once that Lawrence Ritter decided to research and write The Glory of Their Times when he realized that the great players of the dead ball era were dying off. He wanted to preserve their memories while it was still possible. He did us all a favor - The Glory of Their Times is one of the finest books ever written about baseball history. Ritter was a good oral historian - he knew how to draw his subjects out. Where else can you read first-hand accounts of what it was like to play with Ty Cobb?
4,The best revenge is living well,"Rosie Gardener is married to Kent, a gold-digger who treats her like dirt. Unfortunately Rosie parted ways with her best friend Vickie, who warned her against marrying Kent, and now she misses her. The last straw occurs when Kent forgets their wedding anniversary and insults Rosie when she reminds him. Rosie decides that she will no longer be the overweight doormat that she has become and she kicks Kent out of the house. Soon she begins to lose weight and regain her self-esteem. With the encouragement of her friends, she upgrades her business, her appearance, her love life, and her attitude. This book is a fun read, but it goes downhill fast at the end when everything is tied up too easily. Nevertheless, readers will be rooting for Rosie as she turns into a woman who learns to stand up for herself."
2,"Poor writing, bad character development","This was my first and only Fern Michaels book. The writing is so poor it is hard to overlook it and enjoy the book. Also, the heroine comes off as whiny and annoying. I am sorry I wasted my money."
4,Could've been a 5 but...,"the weight thing bothered me somewhat. Over and over again it stated how disgusting even size 14 is. C'mon, size 14 is not hideous ok? Geeze, maybe the author has some issues, she looks like she's at least a size 14 herself and maybe this was cathartic for her.On the other hand, the plot is excellent! I read this in two days and only put it down to work and sleep, I was so interested to see how it ended. The characters were so wonderful, I wanted to jump into the book and be friends with them all (well, except for Kent). I loved the part about Martha and the tree and swing, so sweet. A good read, but still seems to say if you want happiness and a man, you need to weigh 122 lbs. I guess that will ever be with us."
2,Hmmm,"This book was definitely better than the other Fern Michaels books I read. I received several from a coworker who was done with them and decided to give her a try. This book has a good setup and after the awful 'Hey, Good-Looking', this book was better. I would have given it a 3-star, maybe even 4 if it wasn't for the neatly-wrapped up and cheesy ending (I'd have kicked Kenneth out on his butt at the end and not given him one single cent of my money) This book had potential but was ultimately disappointing. Sigh..."
1,Terrible,I have enjoyed Fern Michaels books in the past but this one was terrible. The whole storyline and all the characters were forgetful. I am sorry I purchased it.
4,Norma Jean,"As someone pointed out Marilyn Monroe (AKA Norma Jean Baker)was a size 14 or 16 and nobody would ever accuse her of being overweight. I wear a size 6 but I am very small boned and short. My sister's in law who are tall & medium build wear a size 14 and they look disgustingly voluptuous while I buy t-shirts in kid sizes.And I also agree that Kent needed some serious punishment. His transformation was unrealistic for a person who didn't have a decent bone in his body.But I still enjoyed the book and got a kick out of selling weeds""."
5,Loved it.,This book is so good. I have never finished a book that quick. I couldn't put the book down. I loved the storyline and how it all ended.
4,Pretty Woman,"Desperate for something really interesting to read while I waited on new novels by Mary Higgins Clark and Nicholas Sparks, I stepped out of my comfort zone this week and read a new bestseller by Fern Michaels.""Pretty Woman"" could easily have been the poignant story of ""the girl next door"". Married for three years to a self-consumed cad who took obvious pleasure in belittling her for the excess weight she had gained during their marriage, she felt like anything but a pretty woman.Readers will want to stand up and cheer when this poor, emotionally abused lady finally decides to take charge of her own life. First she removes the source of the abuse and then hires a personal fitness trainer to help her begin the long journey to achieving the healthy body she longed to possess.By the end of the traumatic story, not only does her outer beauty reveal itself, but the strength of her inner beauty allows her to be the ""pretty woman"" she had really always been."
2,Whining Whining Whining,While the story line was good. The constant doubt and whining of both the heroine and the villian were hard to bear without moaning or also whining.
1,Round File,"I got to page 13 before I did something I've never, ever done before in my long life of reading - I threw this book away."
3,Good Golly Miss Michaels!,"This reviewer would hazard a guess, bourne out by previous reviews here, that author Fern Michaels offends the very reader base for whom she writes ""Pretty Woman,"" a very predictable bit of beach reading romantic fluff wherein the reader knows from the get-go that the heroine is going to do the ugly-duckling-into-beautiful-swan thing and get the guy. What grates is that Ms Michaels repeatedly describes and disparages her heroine as a hopeless blimp guilty of the unforgivable/mortal sin of being a size 14 at the beginning of the metamorphosis.News Flash to Fern: Marilyn Monroe was a size 16. The average woman in the USA today is a size 12. <-So sayeth Good Housekeeping magazine, July 2005, page 106. The superslim and svelte are not we who consume your stuff!/TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer"
5,Rascals the Best for me.,"I just bought this cd have all the Young Rascals music since High School.last time I saw Felix was 2010 in Michigan is my 7 time at their concerts,The New Rascals with Gene and Dino the best drummer around,and now Felix with his band my opinion I love his music thank you very much."
5,Transcendant White Soul-Jazz,"For anyone who enjoys equal parts of creative rhythm and sweet melody, this is a great starting point with the Rascals. There is a variety of sound and speed here to please the listener, particularly those with music background, but really for any adventurous listener. Listen to other Rascals albums that followed until their demise, you will not be disappointed."
1,LOOKS AVERAGE ON PICTURE,"THIS BACKPACK WAS ACTUALLY NICE IN COLOR AND STYLE. HOWEVER, IT WAS TOO SMALL FOR ANY USE AT SCHOOL"
2,SKILL BELT SANDER,"Seems that amazon has made a mistake and has attached the Bosch reviews to the Skill sander..Its really not that good of a belt sander, the track works only when flat on the floor, forget vertical.But its cheap and you get what you pay for. For the very occasional use its just ok, for any work that needs precision you will end up doing more damage than good and will then regret spending so little."
3,Not like they used to be,This Skill sander replaced a 15 year old Skill sander with the same spec.s. This sander does not have the same power like the older one. The filter box gets clocked to frequent. I had to unclog the filter after sanding approx. 3 mins. Over all it does get the job done for the price. I think I paid the same price for the older sander 15 years ago so this is a good value .
1,"The Other Reviewers are correct, Shreds belts","I figured surely it couldn't be that bad, but I went thru five belts taking two layers of paint of an area about 24' sq feet. I was able to get one belt to last a bit longer by swapping it end for end before it shreded. The drive wheel is shorter than the front wheel and there is a spot where the belt goes around a metal surface...seems to get real hot and degrade the belt until it fails. Otherwise seemed like a nice device with great ergonomics, but this belt shredding flaw completely obliviates any positives. If you do even a rudimentary amount of sanding, the attractive price will be overwhelmed by a gluttony of sanding belts. Given my estimate of the design flaw, I do not see how a refurbished unit would fare any better. I'll take my sander back to Ace and order somethine else."
1,Shreds belts. Not usefull.,"I bought this sander @ Lowe's since I needed it imediatly to replase a 40 year Wen sander whos motor finally burned up in the middle of a prodject. The first belt shreded 3/4"" off the inside edge & bound up inside. I cleaned up the mess & replaced the belt. I then rered the manual & verified that it was being ooperated properly & was tracking corectly. I made sure I was keeping it level on the work piece, & only the weight of the sander doing the work. The second belt shreded in about 2 min. of sanding. I then gave up & returned it to Lowe's for a refund. I didn't want another Skill, & they didn't have another brand in stock, so my prodject is on hold while I shop Amazon for a replacment."
2,agreed,"Beware the Amazon pairing: I bought this hastily and also bought the belts Amazon recommended. To my dismay, they were 21"" belts and this is an 18"" sander.As for the sander itself, my limited experience agrees with the other reviewers. Sander works great, aside from some belt-eating."
2,"Nice try, but...","I have published a series of directories of political movements since 1969, including the Guide to the American Right. Admittedly, it's difficult to get every organization or serial listed. This publication is riddled with errors, including many of the author's characterizations. I would recommend it for the serious scholar because there is nothing else quite like it on an international scale, but otherwise I regard the research as sloppy and the editorializing biased."
3,Out of date book but true to evaluation,"Purchsed prior to going to Jamaica and was disappointed with what I read but learned the author was right, diving in Jamaica was not very enjoyable for a 50 year veteran of the sport. A novice diver may enjoy it some but not me."
3,ok -- there are better books,"I found this book to be a good source of inspiration for slipcovers, but the directions/instructions were not as good as other books."
1,Not Well Thought Out,"This could be a great carrier if they fixed a couple of major problems. (These problems are big enough to rate a one star.)The first is the break handle. It is too close to the wheel, causing it to be in the way of free wheeling. It also clicks with every spoke.The second problem is the closing allows cats to escape. The only thing holding the front closed is the single latch in the center. It took my cats all of 2 seconds to find the escape routes and leave the carrier. I'm glad they did it before I got outside."
1,"Cheaply made, does not hold a cat or dog securely!!","I purchased this carriage believing per the product description that this would hold my cat. not a chance, it would not hold anything. Number 1, The material feels like paper and in fact could rip easily. Number 2, the closure is velcro! Come on really? ... and they advertise that this is for a cat. Terrible product. A Rip-off. I cannot even return it and get my money back because i cannot find an appropriate box to ship it in. Living in NYC it would cost me more money to return it!HATED THIS Product!"
4,Music from a strange place,I caught Matt Pond PA recently live. He was intriguing. He has surrounded himself with a cast of talented musicians. He is a talented songwriter who seems like he is mostly inspired by early 1970s singers-songwriters like Badfinger and Cat Stevens. He is usually associated with some other emo acts. He seems like he is a little more durable. The songs are mostly piano and guitar based. He is has put out many EPs and albums. Most of the music is diverse and studied. More people should see this guy play. He should tour with someone like Ed Harcourt or Ted Leo.
3,If you are a true sublime you'll want to hear this,"Obviously no one can do a Sublime song better than Sublime but what I like about this album is how everyone put their own style into each of the songs. They didn't try to sound like Sublime but at the same time, you can still imagine Sublime being involved with the making of these songs. The book insert has a little input from each artist on what Sublime meant to them which I enjoyed reading.Notable tracks are Jack Johnson's version of Badfish/Boss DJ and Abstract Rude's Waiting for my Ruca. Los Lobos did a great job on Pawn Shop as well."
4,Tribute,"I see some people complaining about this band and that band being on this tribute album, and truth is, it wouldn't be very good without a wide array of artists. What better way to give a ""tribute"" to diversely inspired band, than to have a diverse group of artists cover their music? Sure, the songs might not all be the best, but if your buying this album, chances are, you've already heard Sublime's version of the song several hundred times. So it closes the mind a bit to a new sounding old song. I, personally, have been kinda tired of Sublime after having their music intravenously hooked up to me for a number of years. This tribute is just what I needed to remind me of one of my favorite bands of all time, while at the same time giving me new versions of songs by some of my other favorite bands."
3,Nice sentiment - poor execution,"I bought this album on the recommendation of a friend after we had a conversation about Sublime... we both really liked Sublime's music and he told me how great this CD was, so I picked it up. Unfortunately, I can't agree that the CD is that ""great."" I enjoyed one or two tracks, and I really laud the effort that went into them - it's never easy to cover another band's hits. But some of the songs are just bad - and with most of them I know I'd rather just hear the actual version. If you like covers and want to hear a bunch of different bands pay tribute to a great band that is no more, pick up this CD. Otherwise, just put in ""40 oz. to Freedom"" or ""Sublime"" and listen to the masters at work."
4,Eclectic Covers,"Not bad! Great mix of funk, jam, blues etc. There are a couple styles of music on here I could do without, but it was worth the purchase! Michael Franti & Spearhead to an awesome job on ""What I got"" and AVAIL's ""Santeria"" was pretty emo."
2,Disappointing,"I love Sublime and Jack Johnson and G. Love, so how could I go wrong. Well, JJ and G. Love come through, but beyond that, there are only a couple of good songs. Los Lobos version of Pawn Shop is solid. That's about it.I should say, also, that the No Doubt live version of DJ's is a good track, but has been widely available for years. I found that to be very sad seeing how Sublime and No Doubt were all friends and came up together out of the same music scene. Pretty lazy of No Doubt in my opinion."
2,it's ok,"sublime is my favorite band, so i got this because i saw it at the record store and was curious. it's not really bad, but when i listened to the songs, it just made me want to listen to sublime instead. i think the jack johnson song is mediocre, the fishbone song is total crap even though i sorta used to like them, and the rest of the songs, with the exception of a few, are totally boring and complete filler. the exceptions - the live no doubt performance, because it has the original energy of the song (""djs""), mike watt & petra haden (although i think it's really gay that they say '2004' cause i hate that they're 'updating' it somehow), half pint's ""get ready"" and the g love song is pretty cool. i'd actually put that one on a mix. it's a neat concept, but, yea i'd rather just listen to sublime. RIP bradley"
2,Bait for online service,"The book is too wordy - in fact the same information is more concisely presented and available for free at DWA website. To follow the method described you need to become a paying member of DWA. A free 2 week trail is also available at the site. This allows you to findout that to really understand and apply this method you need to take several of the $150 classes that DWA also provides. Also, the online service is really geared towards stock brokers (investment advisors).Use the online course - its faster, cheaper and better."
2,Make better use of your time someplace else,If you want to get something out of PnF charting and you have internet access go to StockCharts.com and get an education. Buy this if you want a carry around reference or something on your bookshelf that other people can look at and know the truth about your investing prowess.
2,Technical Analysis De-Mystified - Not,The other review on this date (wentraub) is not a book review but some random thoughts on investing. The Dynamic Asset Level Investing model is not even in the book but a paid service from Dorsey's website!!!!How can Dorsy be one of Wall Street's saviest minds when his is in Virginia?PnF charting is only one of many tool available to a Technician.
2,A Rhino Dissapointment-Very Incomplete,"What I have come to expect of Rhino is thoroughness, and this CD certainly is not thorough, although what is here is of course done very well. Where are the hits Half the Way,Why have you left the one you left me for, etc? I think this could have been a great collection if made longer, or possibly even a two CD set, although maybe they figured nobody would spring for that......too bad, it remains a ""couldve been great""......"
3,nothing left to see in real life,"The book is an archive of photographs taken before vandals, fire, floods, and housing developments and teasure hunters took their toll. While it is a decent book to browse (much like Jeep Trails of Colorado), don't go looking for any of it as whatever ruins there were in 1972 have since been obliterated.Add to the fact that many mining communities of Colorado were based on sulphide ore, which, when opened up and developed, allowed groundwater and snowmelt to create sulphuric acid, which vigorously attacks wood and iron."
5,perfect princess,"My daughter loves this. She is learning to tell time and wants to have an alarm just like the bigger kids. It is simple to use and it is teaching her to tell time. I thought the Cinderella would break off the top but it is made of durable plastic and after a year everything is in tack. My daughter wishes the alarm would be a recording of Cinderella saying, ""Wake up sleepy head"" instead of the annoying beeping noise. Working great and she hasn't missed the bus yet!"
2,Broken clock; good service followup,The clock quit working after 18 hours. I contacted the company. They replaced the item immediately. Replacement clock seems to be working fine.
4,very useful book,this book has a lot of really good ideas for projects that are functional as well as manageable for just about anyone. It is very well illustrated and reader friendly. The author has taken a rather obscure subject and breathed life into it. She shows one how to accomplish charming effects with very little economic output and not a huge investment of time or materials. I think the writer is very creative and expresses her enthusiasm well. I wish the book were longer with a bit more information.
1,"I would not call rail ""kit""!",Bought back in 2007 and need to install now. Just found that it came with only two pieces and no support for the mattress. I would not call it rail kit---simply misleading. Just call it rails and note that you need extra support for mattress!
3,DaVinci Rails,"The wrong color.....the color I needed was discontinued. And it wasn't a complete bracket set, needing crossbars. Shipping was as much as the cost of the rails. Not worth it. Disappointed"
3,worked like a charm!,"Everything fit perfectly except the naills/bolts that came with it were not the standard length. Had to use the ones that I removed from the crib assembly, hence 3 stars."
4,Works Well Once You Get the Right Size Screws,"This was a replacement set because the first set I ordered did not come with the correct screws. The screws that were supplied were not long enough to fit into the anchors so we were not able to use the original product that DaVinci sent us. When we ordered the replacement, it too, came with screws that were too short. So instead of packing it up again, we went to the hardware store and got screws that fit. Once we got everything put together, the rails work great. They are sturdy enough for myself, my husband and 4 year old to snuggle in her bed every night while we read a bedtime story. We haven't had any issues with the bed slipping off the supports. Overall a good product, would be excellent if the right screws were included from the get go."
3,did not fit right,"I had to do adjustments to the rails in order for the full matress to fit in. so, if you dont mind some woodcraft work, they good for the money and they look nice."
4,"Good artists, good music","This CD is a great CD for these new coming artists to show their skill. Just like Shakira with her song Whenever, Wherever, this is her first English singing song and she made her debut on NOW 9.Their is only one problem with it, the problem with it is that it has more slow songs that up-beat songs. Most teen-agers like to hear fast and jumpy music with a good beat. This CD only has a couple of these songs like Shakira, Aerosmith, and some others.I mean, I love some of these songsbecause of how the beat goes along with it. But all in all I think that this CD is a pretty good CD. So I would say to go a head and buy it, it's well worth it."
2,There are problems with pop music today...,"I can safely say that almost all of the music on this CD is meaningless. People should listin to music based on the music, not how hot the people are, or how popular the music is.What saves this from being a 1 star album is the recordings by U2, Aerosmith and Lenny Kravitz."
5,Now 9 hit me!!!,"Now 9 is by far the most upbeat, party music NOW cd there is yet, but seeing the now 10 track list may change my mind!! Otherwise, it's great!The remix of Get the Party Started is okay, but I don't mind listening to it at all. I think that "" Lights, Camera, Action"" could have been, well, not on the CD, because there were a lot of inappropriate things in that song, that a CD in the NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL MUSIC series could do without.The song ""Roll Out"" is my favorite song, because of the way they edited it; with all of those sound effects! I think that all of the music on the CD is great, and this CD has taken me over!!! I hope that the NOW series keeps coming out with CDs because I will buy every one of them!"
3,*Chart toppers or flops?*,"After reading the review about whether or not the songs on this c.d. actually made it onto the hit song charts, I had to agree. I have many of the c.d.'s in the NOW series and am an avid listener to the radio, MTV, ect. I have heard a lot, if not the majority of songs on this c.d., but I could see why a lot of people would not have. I hardly ever hear most of these songs and don't understand why they woudln't put the more popular songs on it. Also, it annoys me a lot that most of the songs on this c.d. and others in the NOW series seem to be extrememly old and tired. I know that they were once very popular, but after a while they start to get very old. Who wants to hear the same song over and over again?"
2,WHAT HAPPENED???,"What the producers of the NOW series need to do now is put out NOW 10 and be done with it. This CD is worse than NOW 2, and that's pretty bad. NOW 9 seems to have every overplayed song on the planet the last few months and have either edited it to leave no content or just played it again to be annoying. I am so sick of most of the songs on this album that I cannot wait until ""Totally Hits 2002"" comes out. The only good songs are at the tail end of this album, from Aerosmith to Adema, and that is IT. Pink's remix is just plain bad (don't worry, the original is featured on ""TH 2002""), Ja Rule's song is tired, Mary J Blige's song is WAY TOO overplayed, and Mr. Cheeks shouldn't even be here. Save your money for a better CD. NOW this is what I call terrible!"
4,SUP!,"This CD ain't bad. My favorite songs include: Family Affair, Get the Party Started, Whenever Wherever, Rollout, and Drowning. lots of other songs r good, too. just listen to the samples. but, unfortunately, if u like these songs from the radio or something then these are totally different because they're CLEAN! pay attention to that word-- CLEAN! CLEAN SONGS! just make sure u know what ur doing when u buy it!"
4,Now THATS what I call music!,"I got this about a couple years ago with birthday money. The cd was great! Except, I dont really like rap, so I couldnt listen through the whole cd...but good thing they put skip buttons on a cd player! The rest was real good, like Shakira, and Destiny's child were my favorite. But still, most of the songs were rap, and if you dont like rap, maybe you shouldnt get this cd."
2,"Good compilation, but not great to dance to","This cd has a nice variety of tunes...but If you prefer continuous, beat on beat dance mixes like they're heard in dance clubs...the absolute BEST c.d. you can get right now is Louie DeVito's Dance Factory. In my opinion...it's hard to dance when the music goes fast one minute and slow the next...and Louie DeVito's c.d.'s are mixed by one of the best dj's out there...BAD BOY JOE. And the DIFFERENCE is definitely IN THE MIX!!"
2,GET A CD BURNER,"PEOPLE...I would say the cd is aight but they need to put the J.Lo- Ain't It Funny (REMIX), the original version of the song just straight up blows."
4,JAMMIN',"When I was really young, I used to bet the other children that I could swallow loose change. The most I ever did was 78 cents and one of them was a quarter."
3,This is ok but......,"As a Now fan, I am a little disapointed in the new Now 9 cd. I dont know about u but I think Now has put to many remixes on this cd. And when there is a good remix that most people have heard, is not on there, such as the Jenifer Lopez song Aint it funny. The Aint It Funny Remix is much better i think then the real one. And why did they skip Always On Time? Anyways this cd has a few good songs on it, but I wouldnt buy it."

1,Worst NOW album,"Most of this album is BORING! Listening-wise, it is. I don't think they sequenced and placed the songs right. There are some good songs here, but the CD drags during the middle, the rock numbers come off very flat on here and it nearly put me to sleep. For the record, Volumes 10 to 15 have really improved in terms of the quality. But Volume 9 is the worst and Ja Rule's lame song on here can't even save it."

2,It hints at greatness,"The Now that's what I call music series has always been one of the stupidest infomercials out there, but many people have dissed on the series. So I'd like to create an alternative:Most of the people who hate this album are like me, and are much more into rock than the r&b;, boy band, and rap that end up on these albums. So there were 2 rock songs. Big whoop. What would be nice is an album, completely made with rock. The problem may be that there are so many different kinds of rock, and some people wouldn't buy the CD because it had, oh, let's say, christian rock on there.(namely Creed b/c POD is tight). But my point is, give the rockers their own compilation CD so we won't have to waste our time talking smack about Now. It's better for everyone."
5,PARTY UP!,"THIS CD IS A PARTY CD AND IT BLENDS GREAT SONGS TOGETHER LIKE ROCK-POP AND HIP-HOP! JA RULE IS RAP BY THE WAY. NSYNC ARE ONE OF THE MOST REFRESHING BOYBANDS AROUND! PEACE OUT, TEA!"
1,ANY compilation with Britney...,"automatically gets 0 stars in my book, but since I have no choice, I have to give it 1. The Gorillaz & Lenny Kravitz tracks are the only ones I even like here. The Smash Mouth remake is alright, but if you think that's better than the original, there's something wrong with you. There's other stuff they could've included here, like White Stripes & Jimmy Eat World... but I'm better off making my own compilation, enuff of this waste of pop."
2,You call that Music?,"I'm sorry I just don't think that Now 9 is nearly as good as the other Now CD's. I mean this one really SUCKS! Out of 20 songs on there I only liked 5. I wouldn't recommend that you get this CD unless you just want the whole ""NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL MUSIC!"" collection."
5,"""Differences...Giving In...Caramel...a headline of hits""","Lights, camera and action with plenty of emotion is ~ ""NOW 9"", the latest release from thisplatinum award winning series...once again, you get more for your money with twenty bigones, you have your music...so let's get the party started.Just take a gander at this all-star lineup ~ Adema...Aerosmith...Backstreet Boys...Mary J.Blige...City High...Destiny's Child...Nelly Furtado...Ginuwine...Incubus...JA Rule...LennyKravitz...Jennifer Lopez...Ludacris...Mr. Cheeks...NSYNC...PeteyPablo...Pink...Shakira...Britney Spears...U2...if it's rock, soul and blends of rap, then we'relivin' it up...this is a multi-talented album...you're stuck in a moment you can't get out of...butremember, just push play...and dig in!..."

1,Alex Fire,"The purpose of buying cds is to get past the plastic covering of ""top 50"" tripe and find out where the good tracks are hiding. Every song on this cd falls under the aforementioned tripe labal. If subliminal messages have conviced you that you can't live another 30 seconds without listening to Britney Spears sing ""I'm a Slave 4 U,"" download it off Kazaa from and put yourself out of your misery.When you buy a cds (and you should) at least do it for the artist not the record industry."
3,Not as good as the others,Honestly the other volumes in this collection had a lot more power hits then this one. Now do not get me wrong this album has a lot of super its suck as shakira and pink. The thing is that there are a lot more r and b songs in here and the rocks songs with the exception of dig in are not so good either. In my opinion get volume 7 better you will like it a lot more.
2,Now 9 is the worst Now album,"The worst Now album of them all. Should have an Advisory sticker, because they did not edit out the f-word. Plus over half the songs are stupid rap crap. But I gave this 2 stars because of ""Family Affair"" and ""Caramel Remix,"" the only good songs on the whole album."
4,Best of....,"This may not be an album for Nomeansno fans because, chances are you have everything they have done up to this point. However, this album is highly recommended for those who want a good overview of one of Canada's greatest, longest running and darkest punk rock acts. The amount of diversity found in their music is enough to keep most people coming back for more. Some of the highlights on this best of include; Theresa, Give Me that Knife, Victory, The River, It’s Catching Up and Rags ‘n’ Bones. It’s Catching Up and Rags ‘n’ Bones are off the album ‘Wrong’ which happens to be one of their best albums. I have only seen the promo, so I have no idea how this album is packaged."
3,I could do without the training wheels,"Don't get me wrong, Paradise Lost is a fantastic book and I strongly suggest picking up a copy, however, you may want to pick up a different version. This copy is sort of cliff notes and original rolled into one. I suppose this could be beneficial for those who have never read Milton before and are doing so for a class, but if you are like me, one who has read and enjoyed paradise lost previously and are looking to add a copy to your personal library, then you may be annoyed by the annotations. Every single page has the authors two cents added about nearly every metaphor and, on some pages, it seems he attempts to explain the entire page. I found myself unable to fully enjoy the actual poem due to the annoyance the annotations were causing me. In the end, Paradise Lost is Paradise Lost and it is all here, but the additional two poems don't make up for the annotations in the main."
3,great if you only really care about the wig and mic,"The glasses in the silver set broken coming out of the package. Earrings are useless as they are for pierced ears and way too big anyhow. My daughter loves the wig and the mic, and although the wig is already getting tangled, she doesn't seem to mind."
2,"Quality absolutely terrible, but fun regardless for Hannah fans!","I have purchased two of these, and neither made it past two days of play, but it was fun for my daughter regardless. The glasses fell apart before being worn, the hair quickly becomes a messy animal, the headband is pretty useless, but the microphone has held up for a couple of months.The bag and mic are all that remains, but I don't regret for a moment the fun we had.The two sets I bought were both blue, but it appears the purple set might be a bit better in quality."
2,Daughter wouldn't wear it.,My 7 year old was dissapointed that it the hair was wavy and with brown streaks. She says Hannah Montana has straight blond hair. Money wasted.
5,a real find for a little girl crazy for Hannah Montanna,Purchased this product for my god daughter who is absolutely crazy about hannah montanna. I was very pleased with both the price and quality of this product and would recommend it for any young lady. This was purchased as a christmas gift and I am sure she is going to love it as did I.
3,The quality is lacking,"We were so excited to get the package and liked all of the accessories included. The microphone fell apart very quickly - all the embelishments just peeled off. The biggest concern was how tangled and knotted the hair on the wig became as soon as you took it out of the package. We were extra careful with it, but could not keep it looking nice. The wig was also difficult to put and keep on, bobby pins helped. We made due and my daughter had fun with it on Halloween. The earings and scarf were a nice touch. I just wish the wig was a little more manageable."
1,very poor quality,I bought this based on the review info that I read! Boy was I disapointed. The wig will not stay on and you can see the net underneath. It also rats easy
1,witchy wig!!!,"I was excited to get this at a great price. BUT the wig, after 2 days looks like straw. Cannot comb throught the plactic hair. Horrible quality, just go to the wig shop to play dress up."
4,great look-decent quality,"i ordered this set for my 10 yr old son. it was used to dress up as hannah montana on halloween. we saw sets of wig & costume, but the outfits looked so flimsy & the reviews were bad. after seeing some of the reviews for this, i called amazon because the biggest complaint was timely arrival. i was assured it was in stock & shippable & did receive it in a few days. the wig was better than i expected for the price, as were the headset and sunglasses. we put it together w/borrowed clothes & he was a big hit. we were constantly told how beautiful our ""daughter"" was. my only complaint was that the wig's adjustment clip broke off & so it wasn't as secure as i would have liked. still-we'll laugh @ the pictures for years to come!!"
3,Hanging in there...,"I ordered this on September 20th for my niece, who is so excited to be HM for Halloween! The estimated shipping was anywhere from October 9 to November 6! Obviously this made me nervous that it wouldn't be in on time, but I decided to give it a shot. All the other HM wigs, costumes, etc. I've seen around have been really shoddy looking. This product appears to be of a better quality. I have been checking twice a week for an update, about to give up hope, and today it finally showed that it had shipped on Oct 11 and should be delivered today. So I'm looking forward to finding it on my doorstep when I get home!"
3,"Makes her happy, I'm ok","I don't really think much of the product, but my niece wanted it, so I got it for her. Package arrived on time and in good shape. No problems with the transaction. My niece plays with it all the time and has a lot of fun."
4,Hannah Montana Fan,"My granddaughter had a ""Hannah Montana"" Christmas with CD's, DVD's and a guitar so this wig, microphone, sunglasses, etc. was the perfect topping. It wasn't overpriced and was indeed a great hit."
3,Hannah wig - just okay,"My 7 year old received this for Christmas. She liked the way she looked in the wig - and it seems really well made - however, it doesn't stay on very good. She lost interest in it after the 1st day."
2,slightly disappointed,"The items in the bag were not exactly the same as shown online. The earings and sunglasses were not the same ones as in the picture when ordering. The same number of items were in the bag, at least. And what was received will hopefully still make our very picky little girl happy."
5,Hannah Montana pack,"My niece LOVED her birthday present. She gave us quite a performance with her wig, sunglasses and microphone. A nice kit."
3,Good for Halloween Costume,Good for Halloween but not much after that as the wig does not keep well. Gets tangled and ratty looking very quick.
4,Love the toy,"I bought this for my seven year old neice and she has loved dressing up with it. Her nine year old sister also asked for one as a birthday gift and I then sent her one too. If dress-up is what your girls love, then this is the gift to buy. The only drawback is the wig really cannot be brushed so it needs to be put up after playing with or it turns ratty."
3,Fun dress up!,"I bought this for my daughter, 5 yrs old, who loved it! She loves it to dress up like Hannah Montana. The only downside was that the wig sheds hair everywhere. My daughter tried to brush it out and hair was falling out of the wig. The glasses are very hip and cute. The bag is ideal to store the glasses, microphone and wig in it."
1,Tired of waiting,"I ordered this item for my 9-year old daughter on August 27, 2007 to wear for Halloween. I thought it would arrive in plenty of time, but the date kept getting pushed back. I did find this item on E-Bay Express for twice the price, and I decided to go ahead and cancel my order and order from there. I wasn't thrilled to pay more, but I was afraid that as Halloween grows closer it will get harder to find!"
5,Review the product not Amazon,"These reviews are to help people to decide to buy this product or not and not for if you have a problem with Amazon. Don't give this HM wig set a low rating because Amazon didn't ship it when they said they would. And, yes, I ordered one for Halloween for my daughter also on August 20th and it wont get here until October 27th and I'm not happy about it but when it does arrive I will make sure to review the product not this site."
1,Wont be delivered before Halloween!!!!,"Hello all,I want to buy this for my daughter just like you all are. I had called Amazon before placing an order, to make sure if I will get this before Halloween. The CS representative said that this will NOT be delivered before Halloween if I placed the order. The earlier delivery date for this item is early November. I decided not to buy this as it wont be available for Halloween."
3,"Except For The Wig, This Is A Nice Set For Girls","If your daughter is crazy about Hannah Montana like mine is, then you have probably already purchased or will shortly be purchasing a tote like this. This particular tote, which is nothing more than a clear plastic bag with purple trim, comes with purple sunglasses, pierced hoop earrings, a headset mic and a blond/purple wig. After receiving this for Christmas, my daughter immediately tried it all on. The wig was an atrocity, becoming tangled, unruly and hard to brush. The glasses are pretty good for the price. The earrings are excellent but, as stated before, are for pierced ears, so you may not want to buy this tote if your daughter's ears aren't pierced. The headset is sturdy and my daughter loves it.Overall, this set is excellent for younger girls. The wig is the only drawback. If you can find a better quality wig elsewhere, I'd buy it instead. The rest of the accessories are worth the price.Only mildly recommended."
1,"Fun idea, but disappointing!",The wig is hard to keep on my daughter's head. Even worse than that is trying to detangle the hair on the wig. The headband was pretty but useless since it was a very small fit. The microphone pretty much fell apart the first times she used it. After taping it together this is the only items with which she cares to play.
3,Hard to keep wig untangled,The wig has a beautiful color but is almost impossible to keep untangled. Now it looks like my daughter has a nest on her head.
3,Hannah's drama,"My daughter was star struck, actually saw gleams in her eyes when she opened this one for Christmas...unfortunately the hair piece gets tangled very quickly. For kids, it sort of hard to keep them untangled, any suggestions?"
3,Fun for a day....,"This Hanna Montana wig and accessories is fun, but the wig gets really tangled pretty quickly and the glasses are way too big for a little girl. She loved it, but kept getting annoyed that the glasses kept falling off her face. She played with it for a day, and hasn't picked it up since."
4,Good product.,"This product was as described, packaged well, but showed up pretty late. I paid for expedited shipping and that didn't help any as the item was back ordered. Would give this a five star, but I believe the shipping time frame was a bit more than was promised. No problem with the part or the seller, just wouldn't pay for expedited shipping in the future."
2,Not a big fan,"I am a huge fan of Katie MacAlister's vampire books, but just could not get into the guardian books at all."
1,I'm suffering...!,"Second in the Aisling Grey, Guardian urban fantasy series that somehow allows Aisling Grey to live. God knows why.My TakeThis has to have been the stupidest heroine I have ever encountered. I kept reading because I kept hoping she would somehow, miraculously stop being such an incredible idiot! There just had to be something redeeming in this crap.She jumps in with both feet. She never listens to anyone. She gets angry when things don't go her way. Which they almost never do because she never listens to anyone. She never stops to find out what the ramifications of anything might be. She's an absolute, complete, and total moron. I haven't much respect for Drake either, because he keeps wanting to be around her.I know this isn't how I normally do a review, but I'll just become furious if I have to spend any more time with this absolute twit."
3,Another fun installment to Aisling Grey's story,"This book was once again LOL funny! I love Jim, the demon dog. He is hilariously snarky but completely devoted to Aisling.I found things a little too convenient at times for this book. Like everyone just happens to be in a place at the same time? I found out reasonings for some of it, but others, not so much. Though I have a feeling that Rene, the cab driver, may be more then what we think.I thought that things came together in an interesting manner, but it seemed a bit too much like the previous book. Similar situations and all that garbedly goo. So that made it not as good as the first one. Jim totally makes the books worth reading, and Drake, the hottest dragon ever makes the story interesting as well.Even though things were too convenient, the story didn't take enough new turns, and Aisling was a bit annoying in her smart stupidity I still really enjoyed this book. I do look forward to continuing the series!"
2,Gave it Back!!!!,"I was waiting with baited breath for this book. When it finallycame out I read it in about 4 hours. After I finished it, I took it to my favorite used bookstore and gave it away. I would not even take a credit for it. Yes, I agree that Aisling whines. Part of it is that everyone one expects her to play by the rules but no one ever explained them to her. It was Drake'sbetrayal I could not stomach. I do not know if I will read the next one"
5,Fire me up,"Another great book with Aisling and her cast of crazy friends, demon dogs, etc. Fast, fun read."
4,"And, she just keeps stumbling along.","I have read the entire series. And, I'm pre-ordered on book #4. The books all seem to be so tongue in cheek...all of them are just good clean fun reading. Nothing serious...but, not fluff either. Aisling seems to stumble through her life. She falls from crisis to crisis. But, always seems to come out on top. Some of her solutions are hilarious.I recommend this author. Everything so far has been a blast. I hope she keeps it up. Ya gotta love the dog...I've got two that are almost like him..minus the magic."
5,Multitasking,The young lady certainly is learning how to multi task. Can hardly wait to see what other adventures she finds herself in.
3,Not Even Close,"While I enjoyed the book, I have to say that it was nowhere near as entertaining as the first one. I have a problem when characters break up for what I consider stupid reasons. I know that the author needs to keep them apart, but surely there's a better way to keep them butting heads without having them break up for stupid reasons. Asling's whining really got on my nerves, the plot is exactly the same, and you learn absolutely nothing more about the characters. The only thing that they will make me buy the next in the series is if I see that Asling has done some growing up. If not, I won't waste my money. The book itself is enjoyable, but if you read the first one ""You Slay Me"" then you will be disappointed."
4,Fired Up And Loving It,"Aisling is back again, along with her pet Newfie Jim, trying to do her best as an antiques courier/Guardian/Keeper of the Gates to Hell but it is not getting any easier.This book is full of laugh out loud moments and leaves you thirsting for the next installment. Drake is back, sexier than ever, and the fireworks between himself and Aisling are only getting hotter. Set in Hungary we get to see another European country through our heroine's eyes as she runs from one adventure to another.For anyone who enjoyed the first book, this one does not disappoint and I highly recommend it. It's perfect for those miserable days when everything has gone wrong and you just need cheering up. If this book does not improve your mood, nothing will."
5,Dragons at it again,"Geez I love these books, If you'd read the first one (You Slay Me) then you know what I mean. Poor Aisling Grey having left the studly dragon Drake who of course is in human form, and also her mate. Travels to Hungary to attend a otherworldly convention. So who else shows up! Thats right Drake. This story moves very quickly with alot of romance, mystery, and murder. Aisling is up to her neck in dragon politics when she finally ok's the mate thing with Drake. I can hardly wait for the next Aisling Grey novel to see what kind of trouble Aisling can get into. Drake as usual is yummy."
5,"Funny, fast paced, exciting, and very well written","I loved this book! Love the whole series! Katie MacAlister really pulls you into this world and makes you feel what the characters feel. I couldn't put it down, it was the best mix of mystery, fantasy, and romance with a dash of who-done-it all wrapped up in humor! I was laughing out loud during the whole book and would recommend this book to any adult looking for a book to read. There's something for everyone in these."
3,"Short, but sweet.","Entertaining characters, a light fun plot (minus the murders), and we learn a tiny bit about being a guardian. Most of the story is love, hate, love, hate between Aisling and Drake, which becomes annoying quick. Aisling and Drake aren't my favorite characters in a series due to Aisling's airheadedness, and Drakes blind arrogance. Yet it was a quick read, funny at times, and enough of a plot to keep me interested. I'd like to find out what happens with Drake and Aisling, but I feel like I already know. They will probably get back together, and fight, and break up, and get back together..."
4,"Fun sequel to ""You Slay Me""","This is book 2 of the Aisling Grey novels and you definitely want to read the first in the series, ""You Slay Me,"" before reading this one. And if you don't want to know too much too soon, don't read the later ones in the series before this one. The books are very linear so you want to read them in order to get the maximum enjoyment. However, if you do as I did and read book 1, then book 4, then book 2, you will still enjoy them but it does take away some of the fun.These books are considered romances, but they don't follow the typical romance novel formula. There is romance and lots of sex but also fantasy and a little mystery added to the blend to keep them interesting."
3,Not that FIRED UP,"As much as I enjoyed this book, and it was a fun read, I have to agree that Aisling is a bit tiring. I also found the plot very predictable with only one surprise. Although Drake's betrayal was a big one. The writing is still quick and funny and I laughed out loud.I love, repeat love Jim and all his ""issues"". I like Nora. I love Drake, even when he is more of a snake than a dragon.I also found myself wondering why Aisling isn't trying to get answers to her questions. Of course the reason is, the story needs to stretch out over more books, but it seems unbelievable that she would just let these things go. For example what is Renee? What about getting pregnant? She mentions these things then does not pursue them, which makes her seem even more stupid.If you don't expect to much, you will be very pleased by this book."
5,Loved it in Kentucky!,"I thought this was a wonderful follow up to the first book, You Slay Me. Ending, a little frustrating but set you up for the third book. Katie MacAlister's humor is wonderful & I love the whole ""dragon"" theme...getting a little tired of vampires & wolves. You should definitely read it!"
3,"Love the characters, hoped for more from this book.","I can't really say anything about the plot to add to the editorial review and comments made by other reviewers. I will say that I absolutely adored You Slay Me and had hoped for a lot more from this book. It was a quick, fun read with absolutely no twists and surprises and I didn't feel that we learned anything significant about any of the characters or the universe kate MacAlister has created. It was about as substantial as fluff which is kinda disappointing given the potential. I love Drake and the dragons, and Jim is hilarious.. Aisling herself could do with.. something. She makes me laugh but she's too childish and wishy washy for me to actually be able to identify with. I think the author needs to do a little development work on her heroine and punch up the plot next time."
2,Just okay,"This book is okay, probably wouldn't buy if I would have flipped through it first, but ordered online. Too many examples, not enough explanation on the actual examples. Alot of examples were redundant."
4,Overall it's a useful book,"I am an ESL teacher using this book with students in Japan. I most like the large number of sample questions, including several full-length tests and accompanying CD's. One problem, though, is that Loughheed's explanations are difficult for even my advanced-level non-native speakers to understand. However, they are very helpful to me as a teacher in explaining how to solve problems. What I do is review his explanations myself before class, then use them as a tool to help teach things to my students as they work through the sample problems. The test section does not include a table giving a model TOEIC score. I wrote the author about this, and he said a conversion chart would be included in the next edition. He also kindly sent me a conversion chart.Overall, it was a useful book and I will continue using it with future students."
5,What a book!,This is the best book on the Stones I have ever read. The photography of the Stones on tour is amazing and them with Paul and Linda Macartney is great. The Rolling Stones were one of the biggest rock bands in the world and still are. No true Stones fan should be without this book. I would definitely recommend buying this book!
1,Far-Fetched,"I bought 2 videos like this to hopefully use for a retreat we were doing that focuses on Jesus' parables. We found the analogies to be a bit far-fetched and we felt like we couldn't even use them. I do not recommend this product. Had it not had an explanation to the videos I probably wouldn't have even put these videos with the parables Jesus told. The videos are good quality, I just didn't quite understand the content."
3,Another great Ralph Cotton novel.,A captivating novel that would be enjoyed by all true western lovers.
1,Depressing,"I was very disappointed in this novel. I often thought I was reading a native American version of Ulysses without the Doomsday book to explain it. I assume some parts were intended to be comical, but,overall, I found the book to be boring and depressing."
3,Broken Whiteheart,"This is only the second book by Ms. Erdrich that I have read and the first was a collaberation with Michael Dorris. For me, this book came off as very bizarre (a man breastfeeding a baby) and depressing (betrayal, loneliness and death). But the thin line between love and hate running through the book is compelling. And I enjoy how Louise writes in the POV or about particular characters. She did it in Crown of Columbus and she does it here. I find myself ""becoming"" her characters as I read each chapter. And the use of the Okijbwa language peaks my curiosity into the culture and lifestyle of these people. I can't rave about the novel because it was so unsettling. But I did enjoy it. She is a talented writer and I can't wait to read her other books."
1,Not Good,The tale was too esoteric. It was very difficult to follow. I could only last one chapter then I was off to sleep!
5,This is my favorite Erdrich book,This is definitely one of her best works yet. It is a spellbinding and powerful book.
5,"Compelling, haunting","With each book, my admiration grows for this writer. Her attention to detail, characterizations, interweaving of mysticism and reality -- and with all, an original dash of humor laced with sadness. As with Burning Tales of Love, she weaves many disparate threads together, creating a narrative blanket that you never want to unwrap from. I've read everything she's written, and in this day when prizes such as the National Book Award mean so much in sales and recognition, it amazes me that her work isn't at least among the finalists."
4,Not one of her best works!,"I am a true fan of Louise Erdrich but I must say this particular book is not my favorite, save it for the last and read ALL of her other books!"
3,not my favorite,"Simon Pulse Romantic Comedies are always a fun read. These books are not necessarily the best written novels but the stories are always fun and you know you will get a happy ending. I think some adult romances could take a note from these books b/c they are characterized well which is much of the battle in writing any novel since you want your characters, for the most part, to be endearing and relatable."
1,wins for worst album ever,"This really is the worst album I have ever hears. I listen to a lot of kids music as my son has been crazy about music since he was a baby. I don't always love it - can do without some of the kids choruses, or the super-happy singers. But this is ten times worse. The songs are trite, and rhyme badly, Donovan's singing is unpalatable, the orchestration entirey insipid. There is one exception -- a woman sings with Donovan on the song ""Colors"" and her voice is extraordinarily beautiful. And then, unfortunatly, he takes over and ruins it."
1,"Yes, a true travesty",Are you kidding me? These old and lovely songs are presented in a ridulous style. Children are more intelligent than the simple-minded cuteness of this recording. The inclusion of cute children's singing and talking makes this unappealing to an adult. This is not a Donovan album. Forget it.
3,"Very cute and nice size, but be careful on gas burner","This is a cute little teapot, and the harmonic whistle sounds nice. It's unfortunate that the some of the hardware on the pot is made of cheap materials. I would have gladly paid more for a teapot just like this but with a little bit higher quality. It is hard to find small teapots, and the design and red color are great. However, the handle and the cover on the spout are actually plastic. You have to be very careful with the level of the flame on a gas burner. I melted the plastic cover on my spout somehow, which is a disappointment. I'm still using it, but it doesn't look as nice. If you have an electric stove it would probably last longer."
2,Doll-sized tea pot,"Although the capacity was listed in the specs, it is much, much smaller than I anticipated and looks like a joke sitting on my stove. The color is just as it appeared (to match my decor), but it is too small to be of any functional use. I'm returning it."
5,Communicate With Your Children By Their Personality Styles,"This book was amazing. I always wondered why I seem to get along better with my son than my daughter. After reading this book, I realized why. My personality is INTJ (Introverted, Intuitive, Thinker, Judger), my son is an ISTJ (Introverted, Sensor, Thinker, Judger), and my daughter is an ENFP (Extroverted, Intuitive, Feeler, Perceiver).I spoke to my ex who I think is an ISTJ, and he said that he also clashes with her all the time. The book teaches way to get along with your children who have different personalities than you. This morning I tried one of the tips she gives. I was trying to dress my daughter, and I said, ""Put your clothes on."" My son did it right away, and my daughter started crying. I said, ""Let me dress as you as a fairy princess."" She stopped crying and put her clothes on with no issues.Definitely get this book. It will help your parenting style."
4,Great flag!,"I'm very happy with this Carolina Panthers garden flag. It is easy to switch out between this one and my UNC Tarheels flag, and it's very sturdy and well made. Excellent price too!"
4,drawing table,The table has a nice large surface which is nice. However one side of it was damaged in shipping. I used it for the bottom. The folding aspect of the table is great and really easy to use. It adjusted perfectly to fit our daughter. Overall really nice product.
5,My Favorite Candy,Sweet and tangy. Original Spree is my absolute fovorite. Great for anyone with sweet tooth.
4,good book,I thought this was a good book. kinda wierd finding out that the twins had two different fathers. But ok...
4,Great Message,"4 1/2 stars! This book delivered a great message, definitely a must read. Don't bother with book 2, total waste of words."
5,Thought provoking,I reallly enjoyed reading this book. It provided an understanding to who I am and has caused me to seek a change.
5,Great life lesson,"This book had me coming back for more. It took me a little longer than it should have to finish reading it but I was so happy I finished it. If you are not close to god this book will definitely have you seeking Christ in the end. I just bought ""Interruption: The Gospel according to Crystal Justine"". I can't wait to begin reading it."
1,Room for Much Improvement,"After reading the reviews for this book, I was hyped for a good read. My expectations were not met. The book was riddled with grammatical errors and changes in tense. The writer's POV was awkward. Sasha's story started out slow, so much so that I did not want to finish the book. I struggled to do so, but did because I had paid for the download. Some of the conflict in the story was resolved way too easily, unrealistic. I would not recommend purchasing the book."
5,Wonderful product!,"I really like this product and it came in the mail so quickly. I am currently pregnant and growing, but don't want to have to buy new bras until I need to for the cup size. This product has made me so much more comfortable and I would recommend it to anyone. I actually am planning on ordering another one soon."
5,"Great product, great price","This product was exactly what I was looking for, and all of the sizes that I ordered matched my bras perfectly. It really saved me from having to buy a new bra too often during my pregnancy. It's actually amazing to me that other extenders cost so much more when this one does the trick perfectly."
5,Bra Extenders,I was surprised at how quickly they arrived. And they were exactly what I needed.Thanks!!!Lisa
5,Loved this product,"This is exactly what I was looking for. Last year I had a back surgery and I needed a bra that would fit me but would be very lose on my back because my current bra was too tight for my very sensitive back. I bought a bra that was two or three sizes bigger than my actual size but it did not work. It was still too tight. I finnally bought these bra extenders and they are perfect!! I can continue using my same bras and they are now lose enough so that they do not cause me any pain.It comes in pairs of two, but I only need to use one of the extenders, wich ties to the other extreme of my bra."
5,Pico the Christmas Cat,"Having just recently experienced this novel, I must caution any would-be reader: the days, nights, and wee hours of the morning spent intoxicated by Labyrinth of Chaos will most deliciously consume and debilitate any notions of daily productivity you might once have entertained.It is rare indeed to be exposed to a tale populated with such a wealth of iconoclastic characters, ideas, and language so that one's psyche revolts against itself.To say the least, I wholeheartedly recommend this book to all who would dare subject themselves to viewpoints that might challenge commonly-held beliefs."
3,Came with chipped paint out of the box,"I only ordered this tea kettle because it qualified for amazon's 4 for 3 offer and the reviews seemed to be solid. I have not used this product and plan to return it since it came with a chipped base out of the box. The only other comment I can make is that the blue color is lighter than I had envisioned and looked ""weird"" to me when placed on my black stove. In sum, this blue tea kettle looked out of place on my stove (my opinion/taste may differ from your experience)."
2,I WISH I could recommend,"I searched long and hard for a reasonably priced kettle with the harmonica whistle. I thought I'd found it with the Calypso but unfortunately after less than a month of use the plastic lid on the spout, and the edge of the handle near the hinge have both started melting. And I don't think it's from using the kettle in any other than a typical fashion. BTW for those who report that the whistle didn't work, there was a care/use insert that told you how to adjust the screw in the spout lid to improve the whistling - alas, I won't get to enjoy it after all. I guess I'm going to have to spend the $ on the Chantal model and hope the hot handle is manageable. Maybe you'll have better luck."
4,Nice product,Good quality and the colour is as shown in ad.not sure how the whistle works or if it doesn't work
1,Looks are deceiving!!!,"I looked for a long time for a tea kettle to purchase for my sister's wedding shower. She is designing a 50's retro-style kitchen and thought this tea kettle would be perfect. Bought this in the summer, because that is when I happened to find this on-line. Anyway, her shower was this past weekend and was I embarased when she took it out of the box and it was chipped. The pink enamel was chipped and I had never taken it out of the box. Now it is ""too late"" to return and I'm stuck with this piece of crap teakettle. I guess I should have thoroughly checked it out before giving it as a gift, but because the box had a see-through front, the product looked fine, and I never removed it from the box. Companies should stand behind their products if they were shipped defectively, no matter the time frame. I will never buy anything from this company again."
5,perfect tea pot,"I purchased this as a gift for my mother, who needed a replacement for her old tea pot. The color is a rather pale yellow and matches her kitchen decore perfectly. She is very happy with the new tea pot."
3,good,"teakettle is good strong quality but the color is not has pink as it appears and the whistle is not loud, I am happy with it but I do not depend on the whistle function"
1,This tea kettle does not whistle,My wife wanted a tea kettle that whistled to let her know the water was boiling. This is called a whistling tea kettle. It does not whistle. I'm trashing it and buying her a different one. Very disappointing.
3,disappointed.,"I was so excited to get a new tea kettle and I thought this would be the perfect one. When I received it in the mail I loved it the color was cute and it felt durable, but was really disappointed that it does not whistle. :( Other than that it's fine I guess."
3,Adorable!!,"I am a little upset that the whistle only works occasionally, but it is very pretty and seems to be made very well."
2,the whistling spout melts,This teakettle worked well for a while but the whistling spout cover is plastic and started dripping onto the stove top. Not happy!
2,Whistling Kettle that doesn't,"After waiting for two weeks for delivery to New Zealand I was delighted to find that the colour and style were exactly what I wanted and it looks great in my kitchen. Unfortunately disappointment followed when I found that for some reason the whistle doesn't work. There is probably a very good reason, but when buying off the net and having it shipped half way round the world, returning it to the supplier and getting a replacement is not an option. If the whistle was working it would definitely rate five stars - it looks good and heats water like it's supposed too. Will this experience put me off purchasing off the net again? Probably not."
3,"Love the look and color, but the sound is quiet","I love the way it looks and it works great (boils water fast). I have a gas range and was worried about fired marks, but none so far. The only problem is the sound it makes, it's a low humming sound... I tend to not hear it, even when I'm in the living room (open concept kitchen/living room). I would never hear it if I was upstairs. I'm not sure if I just haven't left it boil long enough to get loud or if that's how loud it really gets. Will update if humming becomes louder/better."
1,Not for gas ranges,It was a disappointment to find this pot was only for electric stoves. I wish the description had said it wasn't for gas ranges. I would have purchased a different pot.
2,No whistle! :(,"We've tried two of these (Amazon was great about exchanging it), and neither one whistles. Seems like there is a design flaw.It's a pretty teakettle, seems reasonably sturdy, and it does its main job of boiling water, but without the whistle, it's not what was advertised."
3,Great looking,"Nice looking kettle, and it arrived fast. Doesn't whistle however, the water just boils over through the spout and down onto the stove, so I leave the spout hinge open and it works fine."
3,Loved it...until I realized it has a design flaw,"I've had this (pink) tea kettle for about two years now. My husband gave it to me as a Christmas present and I thought it was so cute! I use the kettle pretty much on a daily basis. About a month ago I noticed the interior of the metal piece that holds on the spout cap was rusted. As a result, the screw/rod that enables the cap to flip open and closed partially broke off. Now the cap doesn't close, which means the tea kettle no longer whistles, and the cap is kind of hanging on for dear life now. It's only a matter of time before it falls off completely. I'm very disappointed."
1,Chip resistant kettle came pre-chipped,"Just received this from Amazon. I'm not sure what kind of QA the company runs but I've seen better quality at a swap meet. The kettle came chipped. Not just a little chipped but chipped to the point that it you'd find it in the 95% off bin at a retail store. Specifically, the whole top of the kettle was chipped around the rim as was the spout. In all, 7 chips with the biggest one being half an inch long - seems to me it's a small island and not a chip at that point. This one will be sent back first thing tomorrow."
1,whistling tea kettle has asthma,"The first one we receive wasn't capable of whistling at all (imperfections along the spout let pressure escape).Exchanged the pot, and the new one barely whistles. It's a very low tone similar to blowing into a jug. You might not notice it in the next room. Does boil water, just like the non-whistling teapot we were trying to replace. The whistling is what was desired, and this pot don't play that game."
3,"Very pretty, but ....","This is such a pretty teapot; however, like the other reviews, I found the lack of whistle an issue. It does have a very low hum, which is kind of refreshing. Unfortunately, it doesn't always work. I drink a lot of tea and was trying to avoid burning my house down because I forgot the pot was on the stove. I wanted a pot that would really get my attention. This didn't!The pot itself is really attractive; mine is the bright red! It is heavy and well put together. I am so disappointed about the whistle, but do intend to keep using it."
3,"Close, but no cigar","I was disappointed to see this item was not as vibrant in color as I had hoped and the whistle does not function. However, it is quite serviceable and is the only pink teakettle I have been able to find anywhere, so it's a keeper. As I stated, whistle does not function at all, so pay attention when it is on to boil."
2,Poor quality.,"I was thrilled with this kettle until a few weeks ago. It was a Christmas gift, and not 6 months later and the enamel is chipping off! So for there's been no problem with the integrity of the kettle (no rust, etc.) but I am already shopping for a new one. For the price that was paid, it should have lasted several years."
1,Whistle does not work,This teapot does not whistle and I just lost hard earned money. You could not hear the whistle and I burnt the pot and had to throw it out. Do not recommend this product at all.
1,Terrible...Does not whistle,"As many others have written, this kettle does not whistle no matter what you do to try and correct the problem. I sent it back for a refund."
3,Good until lid broke,"The kettle was very nice. Nice color, good quality paint. Works nearly as expected (except for the whistling... it depended on the mood of the kettle).The problem is that the lid is fragile. It just needed 1 drop and it shattered. The good thing it was tempered glass as it got converted into tiny, harmless pieces of glass. The problem is, you won't find a replacement lid for it, so now it is almost useless, as it needs lots of handling care when using it with hot water, since the vapor goes directly to your hand.I would buy it again only if the lid was all metal."
4,burned dry!,"Burning dry was not the fault of the kettle. I went into the yard and fell asleep in my garden. Am ordering another kettle as soon as I finish writing this! Love it..looks great in my newly custom designed, yellow, pale blue kitchen."
3,Disappointing,"The picture reflectts a bright, lemon yellow. Turned out to be more like the colour of old butter. And, like many other reviewers mentioned, does not whistle. Not very happy with the purchase."
2,Doesn't whistle!!,"I was so excited to find a yellow teapot that whistled. Unfotunately, it doesnt whistle. If you are looking for teapot that looks nice and is priced reasonably then this one is great however, if you actually want it to whistle this one isnt for you."
2,Makes a good decoration at least,"If your're looking for a pretty decoration for your stovetop this could be the tea kettle for you. It's very cute and the lemon color is nice and cheery.But, as other reviewers have said it doesn't whistle. Also, it's very difficult to get the lid to fit the top of the kettle. You have to really fiddle with it. Also, the instructions tell you to use a potholder to hold the lid on as you pour out the boiling water and flip up the cover on the spout.My old Revereware tea kettle wasn't much to look at, but at least it whistled for 10 years and could be used with one hand and no potholder."
3,KT final Concert,"If you like listening to The Kingston Trio sing and play DRUNK you will love this CD. Otherwise it is not one of their better pieces of work. All of the songs have been recorded before in higher quality and with less drinking involved.The late/great John Stewart (I still can't believe he is gone) does a terrible job on Reverend Mr. Black. It's like he was in a hurry to get through with it.But if you are a diehard fan like I am, you my still want to add it to your collection."
2,Disappointment,"As a long-time fan, I wanted one more album, but this was a huge disappointment. Quality was very poor and they spent half the time in unfunny palaver with audience. Songs were not even similar to studio versions.If you have all their albums, don't waste your money on this one. I am giving mine away.Richard"
3,Kingston Trio the final concert,I liked this CD but I prefer the Kingston Trio recorded in a studio.
4,Very Glad To Have This,"An excellent collection of Big Beat/Breakbeats with hard to find songs. For fans of earlier Fatboy Slim, Chemical Brothers and Freestylers."
3,OK historical account of this famous battle,This has been the only book I have read so far on the Battle of Midway. I have read previous books on Pearl Harbour by the same author and I was looking forward to a good account of this battle. Overall I found the book covered all the details with numerous first hand accounts from participants from both sides but it wasn't a book that held me spellbound and glued to the narrative. It was a good working text that gave you a thorough account of the battle and was unbiased in its approach. I am sorry to say however that I was looking for a little bit more to draw me into the story.
4,Pretty thorough study of the famous battle,"This is a pretty thorough study of the famous battle. I think Walter Lord's classic volume is better written -- Lord was a better storyteller. Prange's writing is, as other reviewers pointed out, sometime unnecessarily flowery, resorting to some forced, obscure metaphors and analogies. On the other hand, Prange's book has a lot more raw data -- quotes from documents, diaries and interviews.If you have to read only one book about Midway, I would still recommend Lord's book, but if you are a Midway junkie of sort, then this is the book for you."
3,A good FACTUAL record of Midway,"This is the first book I've read on Midway and I must give the author his due, however, I found it to be a bit dry and short on the narrative (which was much ballyhooed on the cover). If you want 'just the facts' you'll like this book, otherwise look elsewhere."
3,"Interesting, but is it accurate?","In Chapter 31, the authors make a big deal about the use of the singular ""enemy carrier"" instead of the plural ""enemy carriers"" by the Japanese admirals as proof of the confusion the Japanese were in. But the Japanese language does not distinguish between singluar and plural forms so this is just an artifact of the English translation. This makes you wonder just how many conclusions the authors jumped to based on some poor English translation of the Japanese material."
1,Poor quality,I installed this unit in my RV...Installation was easy and the noise level was acceptable....It ran for 2 nights before it seized up...
4,Avery White Shipping Labels for Laser Printers,"These are labels. Nothing more, and nothing less. Want to get excited about something? Better pick something else. The price was right, Amazon Prime made it shipping and tax free, they DO stick, and there sure are plenty of 'em!"
4,Good Solid Model,"Ultimately conversations are the working process of most leadership. This book expands upon the conversation techniques presented in ""Winning Through Participation"". The model is simple and useful. When distilled down, a focused conversation proceeds through four stages:- objective / data- reactional / feeling- interpretive / meaning and- decisional / action.The model takes about 50 pages to explain and is followed by about 150 pages of examples of its application. Many will find that the 10 pages in ""Winning Through Participation"" had enough information to get going."
1,Broken,"Speaker stopped working after only one month in one of the monitors, and after 2 months in the other. It also made lots of clicking noises and fuzz when there is no noise. Our son is only 3 months old, and we are already having to replace it."
1,not happy....,"I did not purchase this item from Amazon, but I own it and am not happy with it. One the the recievers works fine, but the one with the vibration feature has quit already, I bought this monitor the day after Thanksgiving, and after less than a month, one of the receivers is useless."
3,Don't buy this for the Vibrating Receiver...,"We registered for this item, and did receive it as a gift. We chose this model because we liked the fact that there were two receivers, and we really liked the fact that one vibrated. We thought this would be great to wear on the treadmill or while mowing the lawn. Unfortunately, it hardly vibrates when the baby cries, and even if the baby was laying directly next to the main monitor and crying, under most conditions, you won't feel the vibration. Overall, it is a good monitor system, but we felt mislead with the advertisment for the vibrating receiver."
2,Not totally happy,"I received this baby monitor at my baby shower and when my husband and I tested it out we were not impressed. The sound is not very sensitive and we get a hissing noise when there are no vocals. We are not sure if we are going to keep it or not. We are not sure why it is so faint, the distance in our apartment is not very far at all, about 75 feet from our room to the nursery."
2,bad buzzing and vibrator doesn't work,"I've noticed the other review that says the reception is crystal clear and the vibration setting is great. I have no idea why, but it doesn't work for me. I've tried both channels and both have a loud static all the time. The vibration setting does not work at all. I wish it did work! But maybe it's something about my home (home wifi network or cordless telephones?) I don't know. But please don't assume it will work for you, apparently it works for some people but not for others."
1,A problem from the start,"This monitor has been nothing but a problem from the day I brought the first set home. I'm now on my third set and my baby's only been in his own room for four months now. Both receivers in the first set made a constant, loud buzzing sound that started the second week of use. I tried both channels to no avail. I exchanged it for the second set. It worked okay for about six weeks. One of the receivers on this set started making a loud sound like an alarm clock that came on and off intermittenly no matter what channel it was on. I exchanged that for the third set. I had that one about two days before one of the receivers stopped working totally. Changing batteries did nothing. I'm now working with a hodge-podge of an old set a friend gave me with one receiver and the lone working receiver from the Fisher Price set. I refuse to exchange it again. Don't buy this model if you want peace of mind."
1,Disappointed with Fisher Price,"These monitors are not worth the money!!! I purchased these locally and have extremely disappointed. The vibrate feature is worthless along with the ""belt clip"" and so called long range. You can't turn the volume up all the way without being deafened by the static. We continually battle the clicking,buzzing, and neighbors' conversations coming from well over 300 yards away!!! This is one of many disappointing products we have purchased from Fisher Price. I recommend doing some further research before purchasing these monitors"
2,Second receiver stopped working,"I received this monitor as a gift for my second baby. I have a Graco dual receiver monitor that I use for my older toddler. I have had no problems with it. The second vibrating receiver for this Fisher Price model stopped working after about 2 months. So now only one receiver works, and I'm stuck dragging the receiver upstairs and down several times a day. There is also alot of static on the receiver if there is anyone standing nearby. I have to be very careful where I place it at night, or we just hear static all night."
1,TOO MUCH STATIC!!!,This monitor is TERRIBLE!!! All we hear is static. We hate this monitor so much that we are going to buy a different monitor.
1,terrible static no matter where it is,"I have used a fisher price monitor for years and it was o.k. We needed another monitor for second child and purchased this one during a vacation. It was awful. We could not get clear reception no matter where we put it. I took the monitor home after vacation and it still didn't work well in our home. Yes, we could hear the baby but the static was unbearable to listen to."
1,Nothing but STATIC,I think the antena is too small or something because there is so much static. I am going to buy a new monitor because this one is horrible
4,"Brilliant as expected, but read his other books first","Having read everything else by Cormac McCarthy, I turned to _The Gardener's Son_ and was not disappointed. It has often been said but bears repeating that McCarthy is America's greatest living author, and I recommend his novels to anyone who enjoys beautiful writing. But I wouldn't suggest this screenplay unless, like me, you're already addicted to McCarthy and are looking for another ""fix"". It's a short work, fairly expensive for its brief length, and the plot is so sparse that you really have to be a fan of his style to feel as though you've benefitted from reading it. I hesitate to give less than five stars to anything by Cormac McCarthy, but this screenplay is essentially too little of a great thing to merit the unqualified recommendation that I give to all his other books."
2,Not much to say,"I give it 2.5 but I really didn't think there was much of a story here. If you're an admirer and want to read his works, this is an earlier example. Easy, undemanding read."
1,Recaro too heavy,I'm sending this product back today!!! I thought the Recaro booster seat would be light weight and trendy. This seat was so heavy I could hardly get it out of the box.
2,Not Enough Depth,"This book falls into the category of books that provide a survey of a field, useful for a beginner but certainly not for an advanced network administrator or cabling installer. For example, I needed to send instructions to an electrician at a remote site in Alaska on basic cabling techniques so that he could set up a small LAN using best practices. Unfortunately, this book lacked a basic procedure on how to punch down strands of 4-pair on to a punch down block. Another example, the 568a / 568b issues are poorly explained. Therefore, if you need real, hands-on information for an implementation, then move on to another book, perhaps one from BCSI, or perhaps the Sybex book by Groth and McBee."
2,"Great product, but was different color and not clean","I like the product, but I received a navy one, not black that I wanted as well as the stroller was beat up and dirty and did not include all the bars. Would buy the product again, just would be weary from who and would defiantly not buy a used one."
2,I like this but I'd change one thing!,"This is small, easy, an overall a great product. However, it is so lightweight that the slightest imbalance will tip it (this has not happened while the carrier was in place - only prior to me snapping it in)."
4,Been using it for 8 months...,"It folds well, is sturdy, holds both seats firmly. I would recommend this stroller for schlepping the babies in their seats to the doctor, mall, etc. but the tires are not made for long walks on the streets/sidewalks. The rubber will wear down quicker that way. The frame is strong enough, but doesn't seem to be made for rugged walking paths or rough surfaced streets.My only criticism is that once the babies' legs get longer, the baby in the second row will not have much legroom. It seems that this stroller ought to accommodate the babies until they outgrow their seats.The drink holders work well, but I would not put a piping hot 20 ounce coffee in them and go over a bump. I haven't done that, but can see it is possible."
1,Don't use with Chicco Keyfit 30,We bought this stroller to use with our Chicco Keyfit 30 carseats. The seats do not snap onto the stroller or fit on any of the bars securely. They rest on top of the bars and then you have to use a seat belt to strap the seat to the stroller. The seat belt doesn't cross the seat under the clips and just doesn't feel safe.
5,Perfect for newborn twins and everyday use,"I used this stroller every day when dropping off/picking up from daycare. It's perfect for everyday, quick trips to daycare, the doctor, small grocery store trips. It's somewhat difficult to maneuver and is a fairly bumpy ride. So, a second baby jogger-type stroller is better for days at the park or walks in the neighborhood.It is very lightweight, easy to fold and literally throw in the back of the car.Once you get to where you don't want to lug your heavy babies in their carseats anymore then it's time to get yourself a double umbrella stroller for the everyday stuff. But, this is perfect until that point. We used it for our twins until they were 7 months old. By then, I was tired of pulling their carseats out of the car everyday.Great price and easy to resell"
2,"Does the job, but wouldn't buy again","Purchased this in May of 2011 for our newborn twins. Overall, I'm very unhappy with this purchase, but I do feel we got what we paid for.Pros: great storage (although near impossible to access with both car seats attached) and cheap priceCons: incredibly difficult to steer, flimsy constructionEvery time we attempt to steer this stroller it puts such a strain on the frame, I swear the stroller is going to break. And, as many other reviewers have noted, it has become unusable as the twin in the back seat gets his feet pinched by the front car seat. 4 months of use, and now we need to replace it before the boys have outgrown their carseats. Not an ideal scenario at all. Wish we would have just bought our full feature stroller from the beginning - it would have saved us more money than buying 2 strollers!"
2,Not so great,"As a mom of twins i thought this would be the perfect solution for the beginning. And i used this thing for way too long. It is IMPOSSIBLE to steer and you will find yourself straining and backing up a million times just to make a turn. Id say its pretty handy for 2 months max. But you might as well spend $50 more and buy a Graco Duoglider which accepts two carseats as well, steers great, and will last you because its also a real stroller!This double stroller frame is too expensive for what it is (or isnt)."
5,New parents of twins,"We bought the baby trend double snap n go thinking we were not going to get much use out of it. However, to date it is the best investment that we have made. Our twins are now almost 4 months old and we use the snap n go all the time to go to doctor visits, grandma's house, restaurants, etc. It hardly takes up any room and it's easy to open and fold. It's very easy to move the babies in this because you don't have to keep taking them out of their car seat into the stroller and it's much more lightweight then the travel systems out there. We are very satisfied with our purchase."
1,Never buy this thing,This is horrible stroller. It is very hard to fit two car seat. I tried with 2 diferent car seats and was not working properly with either. I'm so concerned with keeping my kids in this stroller. Make me nervous because its rails are so thin and it seems it will fall down. Yesterday is the first time i took my twins with this. We were only able to put one in this and other one we are carrying in hand.A waste of money....Even after car seats seems upside down.
1,Do NOT buy,"If you have the Graco Snugride car seats, do not buy this product. The instructions for customizing for your car seat are terrible - would it kill them to include some pictures so that you could see what they are suggesting? After setting the stroller up the way it is suggested for the Graco Snugride seats, the seats are not level, and they wobble terribly, you'd never want your precious babies riding around in this contraption. I also tried several other set-ups, and none seem secure enough. In addition, the customer service people are not very helpful."
5,"Baby Trend Snap N Go Stroller Frame, Black","This stroller is a life saver. I recently had Twin Baby Boys and it is very easy to get around everywhere now. When I want to go by myself to shop, go to the park with my other kids and go to the mall, I can do it all by myself without carrying two car seats. Plus it is very easy to just take the car seats out of the stroller and put them in my car and it folds fast and easy and fits perfectly in my car trunk. I recommend this stroller to anybody that recently had twins."
2,may not be useful.....,"I have read all the reviews and purchased it on 07/07/2010. It arrived on 07/09/2010. I have purchased new Graco Snugride 32 also on 07/08/2010. Just now I have assembled and modified the bars on the storller to fit for Graco. Great all looks wonderful. Here is the catch... after placing both the infant car seats on the stroller frame, I have noticied that front car seat rests on the rear car seat.I purchased this stroller frame with a useful life of 9-12 months not 3-4 months.This will reduce the useful/shelf live of less than 3 to 4 months. After 4 months, baby sitting in the rear seat will be hitting the front infant seat back. May have grearter chances of his feet get stuck in there also. I am wondering how other parents who rated this product are using even after 4 months. I am in delima to return or take chances to see what is the actual usage?"
4,Great stroller,"I've been using this stroller for about four months and have been very happy with it. It's lightweight, easy to fold and unfold (I can do it with one hand) and is very easy to steer (again, one hand). We have Snugrides and they fit well.The only reason I subtracted a star is because the directions could have been a lot clearer. It requires some assembly and the pictures didn't quite match the parts I had. The drink tray wasn't even mentioned in the directions. Now this isn't an essential part and it just snapped into place, but when you are assembling something that may affect your children's safety, you really don't want to have pieces left over."
3,Pricey for its limited use,"Double snap n go is a good product for carrying twin carseats. It was easy to assemble and use with graco snugride deluxe. However, we couldn't use it for more than 2 months as there is not enough room to accomodate the feet of the child in front. This really sucks. Wish they would extend the length of the frame by 6 inches to make the product much more useful."
4,Instructions are Terrible! Item works Great,"This would have received 5 starts if not for the horrible instructions that came with the product. Baby Trend needs to work on them IMMEDIATELY so that poor pregnant women like myself are not so frustrated trying to figure it out! If you use the Chicco Car Seats (Key Fit 30) view this video the help learn how they seats work with the Double Snap n Go... [...]Now that we have figured THAT part out, we are very happy with the product. Baby Trend needs to pay this woman for her assistance. :) Best of luck to you!!!"
4,It does work with the Keyfit 30s,"I used this for a good 5 months with our twins and the Keyfit 30 seats. It works. I saw the video on youtube, but I actually put them in a little differently. I put the back seat in first, and then put the front seat in. You have to push it down deeper than you think. It takes a little pressure to get it in nice and snug. But once you get them in and strapped, you are good to go! The seats do not lock on, but you don't need them to if you have them sitting in there and strapped properly. For the price, I got more than my money's use out of it. My only complaint is that you really can't reach the bottom basket very well with the seats on it."
2,Stroller Does Not Work with Graco Snugride 35 Car seats,"Putting together the stroller is easy although I do not like the straps you have to use to securely hold in the car seat. My husband had everything put together within a span of 20 minutes. You may need a Phillips head screwdriver and needle nose pliers if you have to change the bar spacing like we did. Once everything was put together we put in the car seats and the car seat, closest to the parent, almost sits on top of the back seat. It wasn't worth keeping for just a few months worth of use so we decided to send it back. Now our only problem is trying to remove the front wheels to make everything fit back inside the original box. The return process was super easy and UPS is set to pick up the package and bring the address label. Do not purchase this stroller frame if you own the Graco Snugride 35 car seats."
4,"one hand fold, compact and light","I was amazed by how easy it is to fold with only one hand! For a double stroller, I thought it would be much more complex. Also, it does not take more room than a single stroller.We use it with Graco snug n ride car seats with no problem.Be aware that the bars to adapt the stroller are a bit lose but it does not matter as their only purpose is to adapt the stroller to the different brands and let the seats rest on it."
2,"just the mirror, no frame",I was expecting a little frame around the mirror; all you get is the glass and I secured it with heavy duty adhesive but it fell off at the carwash.Went to a junkyard and bought the whole piece for a fraction of the cost of a new one.
5,Great Canvases!,A friend of mine loves to paint so I always get her art supplies for gift giving occasions. The ones from Winsor Newton tend to be good quality. These wrap around canvases allow the artist to choose whether or not to paint the edges or leave them blank. Gives the artist a little more control over the end product.
3,Good,Though is has a good library. It does not have a straight forward approach. Nor are you able to take the lessons with you or away from the computer.
2,Not for the beginner!,I found this program to be too confusing for a beginner. Whole paragraphs of Irish written and spoken by a Gaelic speaker are just too overwhelming for a newcomer to the language. I am sorry that I wasted my money on this program.
1,Seriously flawed conceptually.,"This book provided a decent walthrough of MySQL and its JDBC driver, however it made some shocking conceptual mistakes. For instance, the ""Consistency"" principle in ACID transactions has nothing to do with referential integrity, but dirty uncommitted reads. A type 2 and NOT 4 JDBC driver is frequently the best performing type (Oracle's OCI outperforms its Thin and DB2's App seriously outperforms its Net driver). Furthermore, it had one of the most shocking mistakes I've ever seen in a technical book: The ""JavaScript"" example provided is really just scriptlets inside a JSP -- To me, not even understanding what JavaScript is seriously undermined the credibility of this book."
2,Above average--in the number of errors,"Rarely have I been so irritated with a book that I felt compelled to write a review. I feel that the 5-star rating that the book had when I bought is undeserved. It's replete with errors. Even the URL for the companion website is incorrect. I tracked down the companion website with the help of Google and downloaded the samples, but of course, they wouldn't compile. The authors admit to the challenge of timing the release of book with the release of the Connector/J driver. Too difficult to allow for decent quality control it would appear. Detailed examples can be very helpful, but not when the details are wrong. That just makes for massive frustration."
5,Great tool,"When you need one this tool is great to replace seats, thought I have one but misplace it. This item works great for me."
5,Quality Product!,"We looked all over for a shower rod like this. We bought this at a great price from Amazon. It is very sturdy, durable and looks great too!"
4,Shower rod,"It was exactly as described. No problems. I would have prefered a ""solid rod"" with no seams, but this is working fine and the ""joint"" is barely noticable. Thanks."
1,Lot's of fake stuff in here,"While this sauce is acceptably good, (it's neither amazing nor spicy), it lacks any sort of natural ingredients, having a tiny percentage of actual pepper extract. Lot's of other artificial flavors and colors in the mix. Sure, it's cheap, but you get what you pay for. Try the Yucateco version instead, at least it's more natural, and better taste, too."
5,Yum!,"This Chipotle sauce is really good! I'm not a big fan of hot sauce, but I like this stuff. My spouse loves it and I just had to reorder some more. Good in all kinds of food. Has a nice smoky flavor. Excellent addition to homemade chili (I always add some while cooking it). Order multiple bottles to save on shipping."
3,These apartments are not like any in which I have ever lived,"The only way a person could have one of the apartments in this book is if they were a character on Friends or a stockbroker on Wall street. The style is a mix of modern and traditional. The photos are beautiful. However, what you can take from this book may be limited and may depend upon your purpose.Recommendation:If you are looking for a book on decorating tips and projects to improve your apartment, then skip this book. If you were wondering how the other half live or want to be inspired, then try this book."
3,Decent DVD but vocals are distractingly bad...,"Three stars for great picture, smooth editing, solid (if a bit treble-heavy) sound, and 3/4ths of Creed in fine form (their extra guitarist adds a lot as well). Scott Stapp's performance, however, borders on awful. I realize the man was never a powerhouse singer, but here he sounds abnormally bad, as if his voice was shot that particular night. In addition to dodging any high notes, he's frequently off-key and even off-beat a couple of times, and shouts through most of the songs as if trying to just power through it. I guess the expansive production made postponing the show or the filming impossible, but it seems they didn't even try to fix his vocals in post-production (normally I'd be against that sorta thing, but believe me, this DVD could have used it). A shame really since Creed is usually a better band than their many critics would have you believe, but this DVD won't do them any favors."
5,Best Concert EVER !,"I saw Creed performing live at West Palm Beach, FL 2009 . They were more then just great they gave it 120% They made my night ! I got a VIP ticket so I can Meet Creed ! It was one of my all time best concerts ever ! the music was 10/10 .. The Show was amazing ! I give it a 10/10 as a show ! I am just hoping for a Blu Ray Release for this concert . I am a very big creed fan since the first time i got a my hands on their music . I think its a must buy for any Creed Fan !! If your not a fan ... You Should be cause your missing out !! Creed Forever !"
3,"I would give it 5 stars, but Stapp's voice is shot","Scott Stapp used to be able to sing live. I don't know if his voice was just burned out from touring on this dvd or if he is experiencing a more permanent vocal problem, but he sounds like Sylvester Stallone trying to sing Creed songs. Its really too bad because everything else from the band performance to the presentation is top notch. If Stapp's voice is gone for good than the band should just fold and focus on Alter Bridge."
4,Creed DVD,I attended this show when they came to Houston and watching the DVD was just like being there live again. This was a great show!
2,Disappointed Fan,"I love every Creed disc ever made. The new Cd is excellent. So, naturally being such a huge fan, I figured why not spend the $15 and buy the new DVD.From the first song I was bummed. Stapp's vocals are horrible. Not only does he sing off key but he is too dramatic in between songs. Obviously, vocal quality will suffer at a live show. But man...this disc gets unbearable. The visual quality is perfect. The audio is a problem. The first disc purchased froze in various spots, then my replacement disc has audio cut outs on each and every song. Stapp does not sound good on the new songs and it's too bad.The rest of the band is tight throughout. 17 songs on the disc is a bargain.Since this is the only official live dvd out there, many fans will still buy it. Just beware that you might be disappointed somewhat."
3,"All The Fantastic Production Money Can Buy, BUT...","This DVD is fantastically shot with great, large stage, and bombastic pyro and light show BUT, it's downfall is in Scott Stapp's vocals. They are out of pitch and off key. The band plays fantastic, and their sound is impeccable, but if your singer is off/sucks, then your singer sucks! It is too bad because the new Creed album, Full Circle, as well as their other stuff is great in studio. I guess Stapp just can't do it live, which is really too bad. I was disappointed in the DVD due to his lackluster performance. Buyers beware of this fact and if you are a musician, and you can't handle watching anyone sound this bad, then don't waste your money! Long live Alter Bridge...great singer, live as well!lol"
2,"Scott Stapp has lost ""it""","I love creed and all their studio albums. Stapp's voice is unique and that is probably the main reason why I loved all of their singles.UNFORTUNATELY, I watched this dvd and during the first song I knew it was gonna be awful. Stapp was just yelling with a completely flat voice and unable to hold any notes. He was just yelling/talking to a tune. There was absolutely no range in his voice WHATSOEVER. I honestly would have rather he just lip-synced. His stage presence was great. The rest of the band was good, the production was great, lots of fireworks... but Stapp's voice was horrible. I honestly couldn't appreciate any of the songs. During ""with arms wide open"" he actually forgot some words and stumbled to recover the beginning of the second verse. Stapp's voice was nothing like it sounds in his albums.I watched it with some friends and we all just kept looking at each other and being like ""what the f*""?Stay away from this dvd and just listen to the greatest hits."
2,Creed Live,"Creed blows live ! I have always loved their studio albums, they sound great. But Scott Stapp sounds like s*&% live. A waste of money !!!!!"
1,"which is better: ""worst"" or ""awful""?","reading all the praising reviews at first I thought I was going nuts having an absolutely opposite opinion.this is the worst creed live performance DVD ever recorded (mostly thanks to Stapp's lousy performance), and I really hope it is the last one in the row.actually, the band performs fantastic, but it doesn't save Scott's awful vocals, totally f@cked up mixing and cheap video editing (239 hd-cameras - so where the h@ll they where?).save your money for the next one - it should be better.Houston!!! Are u all deaf there?!I'd threw a few rotten tomatoes at the stage (I'd deliberately miss Mark Tremonti and other guys, if u know what I mean)."
2,Horrible sound because of too much bass sound!,I purchase music DVD all the time of my favorite bands. There are some that are put together right and then there are one like this one that someone did not do a good job editing the sound. There is just way too much bass sound which makes it hard to hear the lyrics that Scott is singing.
3,sound quality and mastering is horrendous,"anyone else notice this whether on dd 5.1/ or stereoterrible mastering, can't believe they would put this out...was really looking forward to this....am a huge Scott Phillips fan, one of the great rock drummers of the younger generation...very disappointed!"
1,"LEAVE THIS ONE ON THE SHELF, even for a die hard Creed fan","The quality of the production of this dvd is ok and the band is great (but even better when they are doing ALTER BRIDGE!!!). Scott Stapp brings this all to a grinding halt. He has lost his gift and that is a shame. He once could belt out some great notes but now he just doesn't have it and the addition of the muscle mass doesn't help him. Save your money, if you are a fan of Creed, you'd be better off checking out the Alter Bridge Live from Amsterdam DVD for a truly great concert DVD."
2,What could have been...,"I just saw the HD version of this concert on TV and I just want to know who is the heck ok'd this concert for release?? Scott Stapp is like that over zealous drunk guy trying to sing karaoke...he really tries way too hard with very poor results. It is just sad. They appear to have poured a TON of money into this concert (the record 239 cameras, the stage show, etc.) and it seems like they really wanted to record an amazing concert, but it is just messed up by the vocals. The rest of the band are great and sound tight, the show is amazing...but again, Stapp is just too horrible to enjoy this one. Not recommended unless you are just a die hard Creed fan."
1,Stapp's voice is horrible!,"I painfully watched and listened to this show in awe of how terrible Scott Stapp's voice sounded. I am shocked that Creed would even allow this to be released. It truly sounds like bad karaoke. I've never heard Creed live before, so I don't know if Stapp's voice is always this bad. Not to mention, he acts like a tool on stage. Really a joke of a concert. I like Creed, but this might have been the worst concert I've ever seen. As far as the 5 star reviews go, these people are either tone deaf or it's Creed posting the reviews themselves. Trust me, don't waste your money. It's that bad."
1,WRONG REVIEWS,"What is going on with (weird voice and Jiu Jitsu look) Stapp?Why does this Creed Blu-Ray present reviews about Airborne Toxic Event? * OK, NOW THE REVIEWS ARE CORRECT *"
3,CREED FAN,"I AM A BIG FAN OF CREED . I HAVE SEEN THEM SEVERAL TIMES ANDMOST RECENTLY DURING THEIR RECENT TOUR THIS PAST SUMMER.I'M GLAD THEY ARE BACK TOGETHER AND THEY WERE FANTASTIC IN PERSON,BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT SCOTT'S VOICE CAN'T QUITE HIT THE HIGH NOTESAS WELL AS HE USED TO. I BELIEVE IT IS PROBABLY FROM FATIGUE. THE LIVE DVD SHOULD HAVE HADSOME BETTER CLIPS WHEN HIS VOICE WAS BETTER. I ENJOYED WATCHING IT AND WOULD BUY IT AGAINJIM"
2,Good attempt but...,"I have all of Creed's albums. I've seen them a few times on past tours and was anxious to pick this up. I wished i was happier with the end result. Scott has delivered GREAT past studio and live performances. Maybe it's just this tour, maybe it's his age. Maybe the band needs to start tuning down 1/2 step to make the vocal melodies more accesible to older vocals. The instrumentation on this is very good but i hate to say i think Scott's vocal's limit what the band is able to do. Interesting enough, there is an additional guitarist on stage whose primary job seems to be to assist Scott in high harmonies and other vocal endevours-he does however, add rhythm guitar tracks and acoustic guitar, mandolin. I'm surprised Scott Ok'd the release of this considering his track record. This might be for hardcore Creed fans only."
1,"Horrible Filming of Creed concert Live, DVD,","I love CREED!I saw them five times! They really know how to rock! But whomever put this DVD together did a horrible job, the Music sounds so bad and very unclear due to the sound recording in my opinion. And there is no bass whatsoever..even after I crank it up on my Onkyo stereo system and anyone who knows Creed, knows they play with tons of bass! Also in my opinion they never properly filmed the entire stage and the back drop of the stage..which was a record breaking stage presence with numerous lights and effects ect.. Creed got shanked! They claim to have 239 video cameras filming but the whole DVD is nothing but upclose shots of Scott Stapp. Which of course he did a great job! In my opinion the people who filmed this DVD did such a horrible job of not capturing the entire stage presence..and all the special effects. Just Terrible! Creed should demand their money back!!!"
2,Need to have a certain 'righteous indignation' to read it.,"I have read _Dancing Alone_ several years back as a catechumen in the Carpatho-Rusyn diocese. It was a stumbling block for me, as I did not feel any hostility towards my background (Methodist), but rather was simply looking for the Truth (and I went searching in all sorts of religions - Buddhism especially was quite attractive, but still lacked 'something'). Perhaps those with a righteous indignation - windmills to attack, or legitimate issues - and there is a place for righteous indignation (or zealotry), and it can be a good thing. It is not my temperment however, so if you start reading this book and find it a stumbling block, then by all means, put it down and read another text on Orthodoxy. But for many, this book has been a help in their journey, and these are my mere opinions, from somebody who really doesn't know much of anything, so take that into account."
2,What does this book have to do with Dancing or being Alone?,"I recently read Frank Schaeffer's ""Dancing Alone."" I was expecting to hear of his joy in his new faith (thus the dancing) and the sorrow of his possible estrangement from his former extended family of believers and how he dealt with it (thus the alone). However, the book revealed very little of the author's personal odyssey. It was more on the lines of a very long sermon or perhaps, term paper, analyzing the decay of western versions of Christianity and promoting the eastern version through somewhat rose colored glasses.I have read other books by this author, fiction and non fiction and he always comes off so angry. Sometimes humor and pathos is mixed with the anger making him seem more human but not in this book. I was disappointed.."
1,If you're looking for information on the Orthodox church...,"This is not the book for you.Mr. Schaeffer is an ARTIST who happens to have a famous evangelist for a daddy (Could it be why he published this book?) with no expertise in orthodoxy.Please understand that his 'expertise' is personal experience. If you're going to read this book, please read it as if you are reading a testimony of ones walk to orthodoxy. His unresolved anger with his former evangelist self clouds his arguements."
2,Lopsided,"It's unfortunate that Schaeffer, like so many Protestants who search for the truth, stop at Constantinople rather than completing the journey to Rome. Despite enormous patristic and historical support for Rome's papal claims, so many move from the Protestantism stemming from the heresies of Luther and Calvin to the Protestantism stemming from the grandfather of them all, Photius the Proto-Protestant. I made the same journey as Schaeffer, at the same time, but I actually read the Fathers and ended up in Rome. A much better select would be ""Rome Sweet Home : Our Journey to Catholicism"" -- Scott Hahn, Kimberly Hahn (Contributor); Paperback"
2,"half good, half bad","When Frank Schaeffer spoke at the Festival of Orthodoxy in Dallas in February 2005, he said that he was too harsh in this book, and that were he able to do it over, he would rewrite half of it. I don't know which half or which parts he would rewrite, but I agree with him about the harshness of his tone, which to me seriously degrades the value and trustworthiness of this book. It's interesting, but Schaeffer's jeremiad makes for wearisome reading after awhile."
5,The Dave Barry of his Day,"H. Allen Smith was one of the funniest writers of the first half of the twentieth century.He wrote about ordinary life, his ordinary life that is, in a collection of vignettes about life, the newspaper racket, and show biz. His wry voice still tickles the funny bone long after the formerly prominent of the day have faded beyond obscurity."
3,So you don't have to spend time converting between editions,"A lot of people diss this book for being a 3rd Edition retread of most of the 2nd Edition Ravenloft monsters, but hey, I don't want to do all the legwork of converting them! Plus, unless you're a serious old school junkie you just don't have those old book lying around. I bought it and have no regrets."
3,Some great templates but . . .,"There's very little else going for this book.The slavishly alphabetical structure, combined with the lack of a good index, makes it difficult to find what you're looking for.Plus, some of the classic beasties are included, but others are excluded in favour of some rather odd choices. On the whole, a worthwhile addition to the collection of any DM, if only for some of the nifty undead templates, but an imperfect book at best."
3,A little slow but a good read,"This is not a typical historical fiction book, I found it to be quite slow in parts. The action in this book is nonexistent,too much 3rd person telling of events that happend to others, and not enough of Augustus own words.All in all a very well written book, but this is not a book for an action fan like me."
4,"Great Figurine, Average for Schleich","Compared to other figurines like Safari and Papo, this is a very authentic and beautiful damsel. That said, this is not one of our favorites out of our Schleich and I wish the colors were a little different."
