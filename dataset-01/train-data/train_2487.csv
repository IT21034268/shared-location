1,Don't waste your money on this book....,"I've expected a lot more out of this book considering the Author has written several books and supposedly acclaimed as ""International bestseller"". There are much better books than this one. I was so totally disappointed with with book. Won't even bother to look at any of the Author's other books. Don't waste your money, it's not worth the shipping cost...!!!"
1,Bad driver,You get what you buy it for! The driver is horrible! It cracked after just a month! Don't buy these clubs!
3,Hardwood is tough on 'em,"Got a few, ran them all already. Seems 'green' hardwood is tough on 'em, and the sharpness doesn't last long.But they are cheap enough, and I'll probably purchase more of them to continue cutting wood blanks."
1,"Absolutely awful product, 2 bad in one month","I bought two of these from a local store for two separate houses. After one week one of them said ""lo"" which meant the humidity was below 35%. I knew it wasn't so I turned it to just its ""on"" mode. It ran and started collecting water. Within one week (of the 1 hr on/1 hr off mode) it started smoking and smelling like another reviewer mentioned. The other one that I bought started to exhibit the same ""lo"" issue even though a humidity gauge that I had said it was 65%. I returned both of them and will never purchase another Haier product again. Also, the manual contained so many spelling and other grammatical errors, that it it made it hard to read. Junk, total junk. Haier should be ashamed of themselves."
1,Lasted 3 weeks,"I purchased this item at an electronics store. It seemed to work fine, although it was somewhat noisy. The tank was plenty large enough, any larger and it would have been difficult to carry. The problem occurred three weeks after purchase. I walked into the basement and noticed a strong smell that caused me to think there was some electrical wires burning. I went to the machine and turned it off. It immediately started hissing and smoked rolled out the back of the machine, even after I unplugged it. When I took it back to the store, they couldn't believe how bad it smelled! They returned my money without hesitation."
1,Garbage product and producer,"I will let the accounts of the many dissatisfied Haier victims stand for themselves. Yes, haier produces junk. I will add this; they don't honor their warranty obligations, and if their customer service weren't a run-around, it would be non-existent. My Haier dehumidifirer died before its warranty period was up, and I followed Haier's instructions for intiating a warranty replacement. It has been a month since they received the package of items they requested, and they still haven't shipped a new unit. Delay, ""escalation"", delay, ""escalation to corporate"", etc., and still no action. Don't buy Haier"
5,"You may listen with your ears, but will FEEL with your heart","This album stirs up so many emotions of love, lonely nights, life on the fast track and the slow, that your heart sings along with each track. Kathie Crotty's voice is mesmerizing! Terry Williams's treatment on the guitar adds depth and clarity to the lyrics. I found myself swaying to the bluesy tones. These are lyrics and ""tunes"" with attitude! At the end of the album, you will be begging for more. When will the next CD be out? I can't wait!!!"
5,Life As We Know It should still be on the air!,"A series that revealed the true feelings, fears and inner thoughts of teenage boys, but also included the adults and their stories as well. Well acted, superbly done. Why did it fail? Perhaps the audience is used to those soapy series told from the female point of view, but this one was good and should not have been taken off. Let's be thankful that in this modern age we can get these things on DVD and have some closure, at least."
4,Well worth the money,"I'd only watched two episodes on late night TV before deciding to purchase the complete series. I was disappointed to find out that only 13 episodes had been made, which is a shame, because I highly enjoyed the series. While the ending doesn't quite tie everything up (I assume because everyone thought there'd be a second season) it's satisfying nonetheless. A lot of TV shows are cancelled way too early, and Life As We Know It had the potential to be something great."
1,Dimensions not accurate,"Dorman 42002 states 5.5 inches but it is only like an 1.5"". I needed the long one alas this did not work."
4,"A collection of good, sport's-related, SF short stories.","I bought this for Arthur C. Clark's story ""Sunjammer"". I saw a reference to it recently, and wanted to re-read it, as I had read it 30 or so years ago. The book is short, and has a few clunkers, but overall it has a good mix of science-fiction short stories about sports. I love the old short story format that was so prevalent until around the 80's, and this does not dissappoint. Many good authors, and much dry wit. A winner."
5,Excellent reference book on Italian Cooking,"Would you like to learn all the tips and tricks about Italian Cooking? How about learning what is the best perfoming spaguetti brand, or different types of eggplant and how to work with it? Best garlic crusher, best pans, best everything - look no further: this is the book to get all the information you need.The guys at Cooking Illustrated did an outstanding job researching for this book, I was very pleased and impressed. This is my first ""The Best Recipe Series"" cookbook! (and now I that I know the format of these books I want to buy the other ones too.!!)This is a book you want to take to bed and read - recommended for both the amateur cook and for the professional - lots and lots of interesting facts and information about ingredients, techniques, products, equipment, utensils, you name it.If you are a cookbook lover like myself, you will see the difference between this one and all the rest of the books you have read."
5,"Simple, beautiful","This book is a series of meditations. Each one begins with a well-informed, concise lecture on some aspect of biology. These come together for a charming overview of the subject actually; you can tell that she loves biology and you can feel why.Then, she shifts directly into spiritual reflection. Surprisingly, she was just as insightful in this area! She really has deeply considered the spiritual significance of biology, and her insights were inspiring and refreshing for me. She doesn't over-extend herself either; even as someone with a world-class education in philosophy and religion I found no weaknesses in her thought (and that is very, very unusual).Whether you are depressed by or afraid of science and naturalism, or if you are in love with them, this is a beautiful, profound (yet simple) book for you."
5,"A fun review of evolution, an excellent overview of the beauty of life.","It is refreshing to find a brilliant scientist who is willing to turn nature into poetry and spirituality. It shouldn't matter if you are an atheist or a deist, the description of the common bonds we have with the earth and the different species of the animal kingdom brings tears to your eyes. At the same time, we can have reverence and feeling for the profound desires of humans to communicate and feel intimacy with God who may well be a metaphor for the beauty of the gorgeous biological process."
2,"Disappointing, nothing new here","Disappointing, nothing really new here. A good basic presentation of cell biology rates 2 stars. Otherwise this is another ""your life and consciousness are a biochemical reaction""[ho hum] with generous handfulls of ""nature is wonderful""[yes,but we already know that].Try Thomas Troward or The Kybalion for much older but more useful descriptions of the origins of consciousness in the Universe."
4,Read The Book,"Mulan is a strange young women compared to the other young girls in her town.She doesn't care for beauty and always asks alot of questions. When Mulan learns that her father has been drafted into Khan's army to fight the Tartars, she is shocked-her father is far too old and weak to go to war. She forms a brave plan, which she secretly forms. She asks her familys ancestors to guide her and they send her a small drangon that fits into the size of her palm to help her,and ""At dawn she cut her hair short, put on her father's armor, and fastened his weapons to the horse's saddle."" Mulan is excited and afraid, She studies the art of war, and becomes skilled with the sword. She passes the training test that no other man is traing camp could do.soon finds herself engaged in fierce combat with the Tartars. In an act of bravery her women hood is revealed... i won't tell you the ending!"
1,Not worth the price,"""all natural energy source"" yeah right. 500 mg of ASCORBIC acid duh... ascorbic acid is the SYNTHETIC version of Vit C. Everyone says they get a good kick 28 min after taking this... that would be the KOREN GINSING noted in special blend. Main ingredient in special blend is SPIRULINA which in organic form $15.00 a POUND. Can you say RIP OFF.Oh btw, I consumed ""all natural energy source"" from the organic pot of beans I ate this morning."
5,Burst of Energy is so true for me!,"I ran out of Life's Fortune after moving to a city where I couldn't buy them at the health food store so I just took individual vitamins, but, gradually got so weak I could barely walk across the room. No kidding I am back to my old self now...peppy, zippy, energetic. This is my all-time favorite!Life's Fortune MultiVitamin & Mineral All Natural Energy Source Supplying Whole Food Concentrates - 180 TabsLovelaffs"
3,Good for clinic,"This book explains diseases very clearly and is easy to read. It's good to read during your Pediatric rotation to give you a basic understanding of the most common diseases. However, the Shelf tests are notoriously hard, so don't make Case Files your sole study tool."
3,Not my favorite.,Cases are great to learn from. I needed a book that had more of an outline during my rotation to depend on more than this. So not the greatest decision.
4,Good book,Like the other books in the series this one is good for someone as a starting point. It doesnt have everything but its a great place to start.
4,Easy to Read,"I used this book as the sole source for my shelf study, and got a 77 on the shelf exam - not great, but definitely passing. It's a fairly absorbing book, can be read in a few sittings without a big problem. Obviously someone truly interested in pediatrics would buy a more complete textbook, but this is nice, with vignettes, bold print for the big points, and questions to test your understanding at the end of each chapter."
4,Hot Younger Critic Brings New Perspective,"Laura Cottingham (b.1958), is an openly lesbian cultural critic who tackles vested interests including those of feminist art history. She represents a generation of younger commentators who grew up watching feminism change the world in which they lived. Seeing Through The Seventies: Essays on Feminism and Art contains nine essays on topics as varied as (heterosexual) critic Lucy Lippard, the construction of lesbian history, art exhibits like ""Bad Girls"" and ""The Dinner Party,"" and the L.A. women's art movement of the 1970s. Cottingham uses her lesbian perspective as a tool with which to question assumptions. My only quarrel is that it does not have an index, a distressing omission in a book as useful as this one."
5,Awesome,"Dudes, I bought this cd before knowing spider was robbo's little brother. And i don't care. His music is different. I like it a helluva lot better."
5,"oh, sweet powerman, where did you go?","Being as I first heard them on this album, first saw them while they were touring on this record, I think it's a great place to start. At the time, I had no idea they had 2 previous independent releases but from what I hear this album is a revamped version of ""The Blood Splat Rating System"" for major label release. Powerman were definitely at their prime opening for the likes of Ozzfest 97, Primus and Limp Bizkit before taking over headlining duties once ""Tonight The Stars Revolt!"" was released. If you were to start listening to this band, I would think the time has passed since most of their career gave way to commercial pressure. They were shooting for radio fame instead of continuing this style. I guess the genre was kind of exhausted and Powerman probably needed the ""Transform""ation sound-wise. Enjoy the early years, they were great."
3,Powerman 5000 - 'Mega!! Kung Fu Radio' (Dreamworks),"This is basically more or less a remix of 'The Blood Splat Rating System',with the addition of two new tracks.Must admit this CD is quite a diverse project.'Mega!!Kung...' fuses the elements of rap,hip hop,hardcore and metal to somewhat take a life form of it's very own.Not exactly my cup of tea,but it was decent enough to hold my full attention.See how you like it."
4,Simply a good album!,"This is awesome! Sell your Limp Bizkit to the nearest used CD store, cuz you don't need it anymore. They're way better than Limp Bizkit. Well, Limp Bizkit are still wet behind the ears."
2,Overrated,"Oh great, just what we need, another dreary suicide band who'll tell us just how awful the world is and drive us to depression. It's sad that its so rare to find a band with a positive message that can still rock. A few exceptions are 311, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and NOFX. It's a poor reflection on our generation that bands like this are so popular. Art should promote peace and understanding, not violence and hopelessness."
3,no good compared to TTSR,"I bought this album because i heard tonight the stars revolt....but this album is a major dissapointment..... The only song i liked on this was ""The earth vs. Me""All the other songs on the album just sound the same though....and it is very boring, but it was some what of and OK album.But buy the album ""tonight the stars revolt"", it is about 3 times as good as mega kung foo radio and MKFR is just boring."
5,"""standing 8""and ""neckbone"" stand out","this album is groovey. this album is great to head bang to. forget Spider is Rob Zombies brother and listen to the excellent bass playing of Dorian on the best track ""standing 8"".it has the phattest intro to any song ever. If you are crazy over this album and bought it before ""Tonight..."", like me, you may be disapointed with the newer one.""Mega! Kung-Fu Radio"" is near the top of my list on rap-metal.On the bottom... limp bizkit."
2,Just ok,I bought this for my husband and 2 yo. Beautiful book but very wordy. I was expecting something he could read to her but this isn't it. This is the kind of book that will sit unread on the coffee table or a book case. I actually sent this back to Amazon. Not worth it. Sorry.
2,A disappointing album given the assembled talent,"I had never heard of Floyd Lloyd but I bought the album based on my knowledge of the accompanying musicians. I figured that anybody who could get Ernest Ranglin, Rico Rodriguez, Mikey Chung, Larry McDonald, Dennis Bovell, Eddie ""Tan Tan"" Thorton and Eddie Grant to play on their album must be a significant talent. I was deeply disappointed at the result.Although the musicians gave good performances and the sound quality is better than 95% of the reggae and ska albums I have heard, the album is spoiled by poor lyrics and terrible singing.Mr. Lloyd should have allowed the musicians some room for improvisation and kept his mouth shut. This would have given us a work that could be compared with that of Jazz Jamaica, Ernest Ranglin or Rico Rodriguez. For the benefit of the public and his own record sales I would suggest that Mr. Lloyd remixes and reissues this as a dub album and withdraw the current product."
2,"ok, but...","i think that the guide that came with my book, which shows pictures of the slides that professors are supposed to use was completely usless, if you have to purchase this book for a class, try and get a used copy. It is not worth the price you have to pay. There is another book by Breyli and Meyers titles Corporate Finance which is much more comprehensive and much better."
2,Horrible Book,The only great thing about this book is its small size and thats about it. The text doesn't do a very good job of explaining the ideas and concepts. Say you are given certain parts of an equation it doesn't really show you how to use to components to solve for the right number. Instead it gives you a wonderful GENERAL overview of an idea that is minimal in explanation. I'm almost at the point of flipping out because the lack of explanations and I'm only on Chapter 2.
1,a sorry college level text book,"This book is required for a Finance course. This is one of the worst college level textbooks I have ever been exposed to. I am taking this course as a requirement for a 3rd college degree so I have bought a few textbooks.There are answers to every other problem and not one explanation as to how the answer was derived. Oh wait!!!, you can buy the accompanying student workbook and there are some semi-explanations there.If this book is intended to be a teaching tool it has failed. The authors deserve an F and should reconsider themselves as ""professors"" or educators.My university will hear about this total waste of money.Authors (of this book), educators and others: feel free to contact me and I will elaborate. I will also offer suggestions and solutions to better present the material where this textbook fails. [...]"
1,Global edition missing answer key,"The US edition has four appendices - C is select answers, D is calculator instructions. Despite the fact that the introduction of the book claims it has all four appendices, it actually doesn't. It has three appendices, and is missing the answers for select question. Instead, appendix C is the calculator instructions and appendix D doesn't exist.Beware the global version if your professor isn't providing homework answers because he/she is relying on you having the key available in your text."
2,Minimally helpful text,"Don't be excited about this book's small size and light weight, the text needs more examples to support you while doing homework. Breif chapter explantions caused me to nearly fail my class. Was NOT a gret book, in fact many students complained to the Dean regarding this book. Good luck."
3,Tough to read,Ritter is not afraid to go out on a limb with his opinions. He also has a command of the facts (as he sees them). His writing style is somewhat difficult to wade through. Interesting read if you can muddle through it.
2,Warning Spoilers,"The first few minutes of this thing was promising, so even though I saw it was only 26 minutes, I decided to go ahead and rent it.I was disappointed.First of all, they talk. Talking zombies has only sat well with me one time, and that was Return of the Living Dead Part One. The talking wasn't horrible, but it made me say ""uh oh"".I guess mostly there was too much whining. As I said, the first few minutes were great, but once they got into the apartment...nope.If you want to see a zombie flick that gives you zombies in one apartment complex with a claustrophobic feeling, I recommend Rammbock Berlin Undead. I think you may like that one better."
1,CAN YOU GIVE A MOVIE NEGATIVE STARS???,"This movie sucked so bad that I wished I had clawed my eyes out. Understandable that it's probably a bunch of friends who somehow made a movie together, but don't charge people for this. The acting was awful, perpetual darkness that didn't give me any feelings horror and 1/3 of the movie is credits in the beginning. I can't stand how Amazon allows movies that are this terrible to be on their Instant Viewing. Don't Watch this!!!"
3,OK,Good story. Characters were developed but still the effects were cheesy. Wasn't the Romero itch I had at the time
1,Bad,"The only redeeming quality in this sun ""b"" movie is the fact that it is short. I've seen better acting in a high school drama class."
5,excellent book! this definately needs to be read,This is a great book for owners of businesses or people who work for corporations. I enjoyed the chapter about managing young workers.
3,Carey could've done better,"My favorite Trek writer is Diane Carey. I've read a few of her TNG books. But Dominion War Book 2 wasn't the best she's done. I didn't enjoy this novel as much as DW Book 1 and 3 by John Vornholt. Maybe it's the fact that I don't like DS9 as much as TNG, or maybe it's because it was a novelization. Novelizations are okay, but real imagination comes out in original novels.Better luck next time, Carey!"
2,novelization of 6th season episodes,"Starting with the occupation of Terrok Nor (Deep Space 9), this book just breezes through the highlights of the whole season. There is very little in here that was not on our tv screens, and there was little need for me to spend the money. I expected an original story set during the Dominion conflict like book one. I was dissappointed!"
2,This is a novelization of ST:DS9 episodes already shown.,"Book 1 of this series is an original story. However, book two (and I suspect book that book four will be also) is just a cheap novelization of ST:DS9 episodes involving the Dominion war. Rip off! It's one thing to refer to all the elements that took place in the episodes, but quite another to sell a book that most people have already watched!"
3,A bit of London in the 90s,"Crikey have that many people bought this book! How it will register to non-Londoners not quite sure. The slang is legit, so are the tunes. Solid writing carries it though it occasionally wanders. Wished some of the many potent scenes were extended and explored. Think of main character Dele as the kind of person you might meet in the street of a foreign city, strike up a relationship with and then be shown several interesting and new places, but without any real help from his part as to what to make of them. Catch it most of all for great snapshots of London life covering Brixton, local council rallies, and a few of choice varieties of denizen. Things nice to play and flavour any impressions when visiting or simply residing in the grand old city."
3,Too ordinary..,"I read this book a few months ago and I found it average, not too good, not too bad. It's the story of a young black Nigerian-oriented student in London. I found Adebayo's narrative quite slang and way too informal. It's not a bad book, but there are definitely better coming-of-age novels than this one."
1,What kind of black?,An under researched book that fails to capture a sense of Black London. Interesting writing style but the portrayed environment doesn't ring true.
3,Fun but heavy on the bigotry,"On one hand this is a fun, fast moving, and engaging kids book that's got a dark and twisted sense of fun. However, and perhaps this is a left-over from it being written in the seventies, but there are unnerving moments of bigotry peppered through it. Characters insult each other by calling each other ""faggot"" in a derogatory sense, and there are occasional racial jokes like all ""Chinamen look alike"". A parent reading it to their kids can easily censor or discuss this with their kid, but depending on the circumstances the casual bigotry in the book might be enough to cause one to choose a different story. Be warned."
4,Amazingly hilarious!,"Once you pass by these kinds of books, you might think to yourself that you would never try to read them until you had absolutely nothing left to do. That was the same for me. I sat one day staring at my shelf of books, and decided that I would read it, but if I thought the first page would be pure torture, I would just drop it. Five minutes later, I sat with my eyes glued to the book, laughing at paragraphs with clusters of witty humor. It seemed like I was tumbling through a dimension where common sense hailed magic, and where good always taught a lesson to evil. Don't worry; you'll see Eva Ibbotson's stories unfold right before your own eyes once you experience this book."
5,Awesome,"Great lifetime filter, great upgrade for my car. Easily installed and only requires cleaning once every 50,000 miles! I never have to buy another air filter for my Honda, EVER !!"
5,Excellent Curtain!!!,"It's like being in my yard (which I love working on) while showering!! The curtain is high quality and I have washed it in the clothes washer probably three times since I bought it and it's still going strong. The seller was very friendly and helpfull, had my package to me in less than a week, and all I have left to say is GREAT!!!!"
5,Great addition to your CD collection!,"This CD was recommended to me by a friend -- I usually don't buy CDs of artists that I don't know much about, but I'm sure glad I got this one! This is a great CD -- this band is really going to go places! I listen to it all the time -- it is da bomb! I hope they're working on their next one -- I can't wait!"
2,not in spanish,This book is not in Spanish and English as I expected. it is in English and has a few Spanish words mixed in.
5,WONDERFUL!,"This CD is wonderful! I love it. The whole cast is amazing. They put so much energy in their parts, its incrediable. They all fit their roles very well. My favorite songs on this would have tp be One Song Glory, Rent, Will I?, Over the Moon, and so on. If you are a fan of musicals then this CD definitly belongs in your collection. You will absolutley love it."
5,A MUST HAVE!!,"This is the best CD that I have ever owned. I saw the play in New York City, but after getting the CD, I realized that anyone could by it and by reading along, follow the songs. The songs were what made up the play so buy it, turn it up loud, and enjoy!!"
5,Rent is Amazing,"I had never seen a Broadway show. A friend and me went to New York and see Movin' Out. She talked me into Rent. It was one of the most amazng experiences. The plot has been spoken of in reviews already. Let me dwell on the effect of the play, and the music, because the two are inexorably intertwined.The stories are told in the songs. An HIV positive Transvestite who becomes the center of the relationship that these young people share, and helps to reform a bond that had been lost. You leave the show humming and singing the tunes. Every time you hear them they will bring a smile to your face or a tear to your eye. If you have seen the play, you must have the soundtrack."
4,Christmas Bells are ringing....,"This show has awesome music and some shining moments, but some of the issues addressed take on a trivial or positive light, when there most definatly should not be one there. I'd like to quote a local newspaper when I say this ""Rent has Fabulous Music, but is morally bereft""."
5,Musical Theatre at It's BEST!!!!!,"Every once in a while a musical comes along that takes Broadway by storm and inspires Young and Old Thespians alike. Larson's ""RENT"" does this! This ""Rock opera"" as it has been called before is not only wonderfully orchestrated and sun but it amazing to watch as it is performed live on stage. With it's controversial themes and in your face realism of reality, I can honestly say that ""RENT"" along with countless other ""SMASH BROADWAY HITS"" will be apart of Musical history forever."
1,rant,sorry but I have tried and tried and I just find this to be the most boring musical ever put together.
2,A 90's classic.,"Yeah, we did go crazy over this musical. Great songs, cute Village kidoes singing, drinking, cursing, rubbing...oh, u know how it goes.Good classic, romantic HIV-positive love story.But, itz like the Leon-goat-beard: stuck tight, way back in 90's! A decade is enough to make me feel .... listening to the songs.Of course, if u r a fresh-on-Broadway, please enjoy. They're still playing around Times Sq anyway."
1,sorry...just dull,I can't help it. I have tried and tried and I just find it boring. Dull. And not near as clever as people have raved.
1,Let's all hope that's not the way musicals are heading...,"I got this CD Set quite cheap in Germany (approx. 10$) and I have to say: It's not worth more. Whatever this is, it is most definitely not a musical in the classical sense. If you are fed up with Les Miz, Phantom etc. then get something like 'A new brain', 'Ragtime', 'Side Show' etc. but not 'Rent'. The 'Voice Mail' parts really get on my nerves. This music has been put together for the MTV Generation to get them into musical theatre. Sondheim (worst composer ever) in the 90's!"
4,Still going strong in 2004!,"While not to every taste, RENT has proven a long running success on Broadway still running as of Jan 2004 and heading into its 9th year at the Nederlander theatre.The original cast recording preserves virtually the entire show with the people who originally made it. The premiere cast has never been bettered but stong replacements have kept the show running. (A replacement for Angel was Jai Rodriguez who is now one of the ""fab five"" on QUEER EYE FOR THE STRAIGHT GUY!)The tragic untimely death of Jonathan Larson has elevated the show to legendary status. Had he not passed away, there are probably a few sections he would have rewritten, tightened or changed but the show as it is plays just fine.The label later issued a single CD of highlights from RENT. Skip it. If you like the show, then this complete OCR is the one you'll want."
5,A Cast worth remembering,I enjoyed the music more than I enjoyed the show. It's hard to get a better cast than this album.
5,RENT is the greatest show and soundtrack!!!!!!!buy it!!!!!!!,I was amazed at the talent the actors and actresses had when i first listened to the soundtrack of RENT. I highly reccomend it! Everyone should have it at their houses!
5,Amazing!,"I've heard many musicals,but RENT is something special. It's a rock opera from the amazing Jonathan Larson;almost in a class of its own. I highly suggest you buy it,listen to it,and prepare to be hooked!On a personal note,I recently saw RENT and was blown away. So get it. Remember,No Day But Today."
5,You'll love it more every time you hear it,"I bought the RENT soundtrack after seeing the show for the first time, put it in my CD player, and haven't taken it out since. As the type of person who will play favorite songs over and over until I get sick of them, I was worried the same thing would happen with RENT - but that hasn't been the case. Every time I listen to it, I fall in love with it even more. And when I saw the play again about a month ago, I was moved even more deeply by the characters, the plot, and the music than I had been the first time.Jonathan has written an absolutely brilliant musical that I will never, ever tire of hearing. I'd recommend the soundtrack to anyone, whether they've seen RENT or not."
5,the music is amazing!,"i love this cd, i think this might be my favorite score. Favorite songs are ""One Song GLory"", ""Take Me or Leave Me"", and ""La Vie Boheme"". ""Over the Moon"" and the voicemails are hilarious. i would recommend seeing the show first, though. i enjoyed the music a whole lot more after i had seen it; it's easier to understand the story and the characters better."
5,Rent is a new experience every time you hear it.,"RENT IS BROADWAY'S BEST IN A LONG TIME. IT'S NOT TOO OFTEN THAT A MUSICAL COMES ALONG THAT CAN TOUCH YOUR HEART FOREVER. RENT IS THE BEST CD THAT I HAVE EVER OWNED. IT NEVER GETS OLD. I CAN BE HAVING THE WORST DAY EVER, BUT IF I COME HOME TURN ON RENT AND UNWIND, MY COMPLETLY. IN SHORT ANYONE WHO HAS NOT HEARD RENT SHOULD, I'LL GAURENTEE YOU'LL LOVE IT!"
5,A must have,"When I saw the musical I thought it was good. When I listened to the cd I thought it was great. Some of the best songs in any musical around. I especially liked 'One Song Glory' and 'What you Own'. For anybody out there that is thinking about getting this cd, don't think about it any more. JUST GET IT!!!"
5,A Great CD,"RENT has some GREAT songs on it. I have bought this CD many times over the years - it has many GREAT songs on it. I have bought one CD recently, and it was the Rent CD. From the song I'LL COVER YOU to SEASONS OF LOVE - it has brought me many hours of pleasure. I Highly recommend it. You cannot go wrong with this CD."
5,It got me hooked to Broadway!,"I first saw RENT on Broadway, 3 or 4 years ago. I liked it, but I was young, so I didn't understand it. Then last weekend, I saw it again, not on Broadway, but none-the-less, it totally blew my mind away.The songs are so beautiful and powerful. I don't reccomend this soundtrack or musical to anyone that is close-minded. You have to be able to past the homosexualism and the aids to see the beauty of the play. The songs are great and I hope to see the musical again. I have been toying with the idea of going into theater when I graduate from school. Seeing RENT has totally almost finallized that dream. I can't sing, but I'm willing to practice as hard as I can to be able to do something as magificent as that!"
2,"Rent, it depends!","I don't like the score of this musical very much, and I was kinda shock that people regard this as one of the best scores ever written in a musical. That was not true, at least for me!!! Most of the songs are dialogue driven, meaning most of the songs are actually just conversations with melody having lots of plots. Even the trademark song of the musical Seasons of Love isn't as catchy as the title suggests, you'll have to listen to it for a while to appreciate the melody. Although I have to admit that the lyrics were great, I just wish they were put in a nicer and quieter melody. Everyone seems to shout!!! If you like musicals like Miss Saigon and you wish to stick with that genre, I strongly not recommend this one, since the music are mostly r and b, and rock opera!!! But if you still wish to see for yourself the fuzz about this musical, I suggest to download first some of the songs from the CD, then decide! Grade: B-"
2,Ignore the hype,"Trendy, ultimately forgettable mid-90s shlock. Like most modern shows it has about three good songs in it, and a lot of dialogue set to music in between."
2,Mediocre Music About Irresponsible Brats,"I'm as enlightened as any blue stater, but this show would not have gone far without the publicity of the author Jonathon Larson's death right before it went to broadway. The show is about a community of stubborn, young ""artists,"" who think that because they are artists that they don't have to be responsible grown-ups. Most of the crowd lie, steal, cheat romantically, and can't hold down a job. The show's fatal flaw is that it celebrates these children's irresponsibility and amorality rather than prosecutes them for it. The author seems to proclaim the old, tired lie that it is not the fault of these ""artists,"" but the fault of society. That being said, ""Seasons of Love"" is a lovely anthem when taken out of the context of this amoral show, and ""La Vie Boheme"" is delightfully clever. Had Larson lived and grown up a bit, he could have someday written something worthwhile."
2,To Be Honest...Quite Boring,"I found Rent, for all of its misappropriated horn-tooting, to be quite dull. It labels itself a ""rock musical"" and its fans tout ""Rent"" to be the greatest musical ever. Well, I've heard better. I cared so little for the characters I actually found myself rolling my eyes just listening to the recording. With only a few standout songs (La Vie Boheme, I'll Cover You, Seasons of Love), the show is unexciting and far to egotistical for its own good. Don't be fooled by friends who will undoubtedly tell you how it changed their lives. Each and every character is stereotyped beyond belief and not in a suitable manner either. And with a yawning plot, Rent is not the type of musical we need to hear. Get a quality cast recording instead (hint: Bat Boy, a true rock musical)"
5,RENT rocks!!,"I loved RENT, a very moving play. These songs are what make it great. Here are my fav songs in the order they appear on the CD:TUNE UPSRENTLIGHT MY CANDLETODAY 4 UYOU'LL SEEOUT TONIGHTANOTHER DAYI'LL COVER YOUCHRISTMAS BELLSOVER THE MOONLA VIE BOHEMEHAPPY NEW YEARTAKE ME OR LEAVE MEGOODBYE LOVEYou will love this so much. Believe me. No matter what type of music you like. Buy it & you will not regret it"
5,Worth it,"I grew up listening to this sound track...it's incredible and will always be my favorite broadway play. I listen to it constantly mixed in with my other songs-not ""show tuney"" at all"
4,Broadway,"I was hesitant about purchasing ""Rent (1996 Original Broadway Cast)"" due to the language on the 'listen first' tracks. I plan to see the broadway locally and therefore, bought it. I love it. I would not play it around children or anyone offended by language or homosexuality. The original cast has so much talent. I wish I could have seen them on Broadway. I received this CD quickly and prompty."
3,Rent: The original cast recording,"I received the cd in a timely matter, however there are a few songs I can not listen to because of bad scratches on the cd."
5,THIS SHOW IS SO AMAZING!,Rent has to be one the best broadway shows ever maade!! The music is amazing! It has a rock feel to it but alos some R&B like the song Santa Fe. I have seen this show 5 times and it is well worth it!
5,RENT is the greatest musical achievement ever!,"There has never been a better musical than RENT! With its pulsating rock music, magical lyrics, and powerful story, it deserves to out-run CATS as Broadway's longest-running musical. I listen to the OBCR just about every day because it's so great!!!"
5,Buy it.,"Please don't miss this. RENT is...stunning. All I can say is get it. You'll love it, I promise you. END"
5,Yay! Rent!,"I love rent, and I love this CD. I do think Mimi's voice is better in the movie, but lots of the good songs, such as Happy New Year, weren't in the movie. If all the songs you like are in the movie, then I would suggest getting that soundtrack. Don't get the highlights CD, it leaves off all the important songs."
5,BLOODY BRILLIANT!!!!,"I must say that it is a shame that Jonathan Larson died before it opened, who knows what he could have had in store for Broadway in the future. Anyway the CD is great the songs are really well sung and Anthony Rapp and Adam Pascall are really good in it aswell. This is well worth buying, very modern, very meaningful. A CD for todays generation."
5,AWESOME!,"I love RENT! It is the best musical to ever hit Broadway! The soundtrack is amazing, just like the performance!"
5,I love this musical!,I borrowed a friends CD and I totally didn't want to give it back. I haven't even seen the show yet but I cried through the second CD anyhow. It's touching and realistic and fairytale-ish all at the same time. I haven't meet anyone yet who heard the music and didn't like it. It's story is unique in the way it's told and in the characters and the mix in the styles of music.
5,A Leap of Faith: Rent,"Thankyou Jonathan Larson and the cast of Rent for this wake-up call to America. After listening to Rent, my perspective drastically increased at the realization that what these people are singing about is not historical fiction. It's right here, right now, in our own backyard. Rent is a revolution on a CD. The music itself is frighteningly beautiful and thought-provoking. If you love Broadway music, I can't guarantee that you'll love Rent because it is very different from most Broadway shows. Listen to Rent with an open mind and I can guarentee that you'll be pleasantly surprised."
5,I'd give it TEN stars if I could!,I saw this on Broadway and then had to buy the CD set! I must have driven my husband absolutely crazy listening to this over and over. But it is SO beautiful and so well written and you can relive the very touching story over and over again. I am just in awe of this show. If you haven't seen it - definitely do. And if you've never seen a Broadway show - make this your first. It's just beautiful. Finally a beautiful musical about modern life.
5,AMAZING,I SAW RENT LIVE AND IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST MOVING EXPERIENCES OF MY LIFE. THE SOUNDTRACK HAS BEEN A WELCOME ADDITION TO MY CD COLLECTION AND I JUST CAN'T SEEM TO GET ENOUGH OF IT. THE MUSIC AN LYRICS ARE INCREDIBLE; EXTREMEMLY MOVING AT TIMES AND JUST PLAIN FUNNY AT OTHERS. I WOULD RECOMEND THIS TRACK TO ANYONE. IT IS INCREDIBLE.
5,GREAT MUSIC,"This soundtrack has great music. Eventhough I have not seen the musical, listening to the CD makes me want to see it so bad. When I first got the CD I could not stop listinging to it. Every day I would come home from school and listen to it, when I was on the computer and doing my homework. After about a day of listening to RENT I knew a lot of the words. In our high school chours we sang ""Seasons of Love"" for our Spring concert. The rest of the day, people could not stop singing ""Five hundred, twenty-five thousand, six hundred minutes"". Rent is a fun and interseting CD to listening to. It will keep you listening day after day."
3,Imagine what a sophomore effort would have been like!?,"Under the tutelage of Sondheim, Larson has crafted an amazing first-effort piece of music. With strong melodic themes and amazing fugue-like ballads (""Will I"" and ""Seasons of Love"") Larson paints a portrait of what tomorrow's musical MIGHT look like. What's lacking? Stay power. Rock-Opera style musicals are fun, for a time, but they undoubtedly fade away. Take ""Hair"" for instance, or the Who's ""Tommy"". Both were huge hits in their day yet have gradually begun to fall out of the public eye. They became dated. Rent will no doubt suffer the same fate. With blatantly 90's style music this show has a good chance of actually sounding silly in 10 years. Conclusion? The show's fun...a little simplistic...but worth getting if you don't mind the fact that, like a ""dead bear"" tattoo, you will be embarrassed to admit having this recording in years to come."
2,I do not understand the hype,I do not understand the hype that this musical has.There are maybe only a few song's on this Cd that I really like and the music it in my eye's to rock for musical's.
5,Musings of a Renthead...,"I have to confess-- I missed seeing this show when it came by LA a couple years ago, but made up for it when RENT hit Orange County. I saw the show twice in a month, and am now certifiably obsessed. The music is uplifting, the optimism contagious, and the plot amazing. About 30 of my college dormmates and I are going again in Janurary-- and I'll enjoy every note just as much as the first time!"
5,The individual performances and ensemble are outstanding.,"Never in a life tiime of listening and loving musical theatre have I been so moved by one work. The young, strong, enthusiastic voices of these actors is/was far reaching. When hearing the arrangements in total, I was personally transported to a dimension where you can laugh in one instance and quite literally cry the next. Bravo, is all that can be said to express the overwhelming feelings this piece invokes."
5,Amazing,"Those true-blue RENT fans will agree when I say that RENT is more than just a musical, it is a way of life. Dealing with issues like AIDS, drugs, betrayal, sex and the true meaning of life, RENT surpasses other shallow musical accomplishments and puts real heart and soul into every word. This is music you'll dance with, cry with, laugh with and fall in love with. Combining punk, R&B, gospel, pop, rock, fusion and even rap, this libretto appeals to the widest range of musical tastes. While the lyrics get a little racy, they honestly portray life on the street and give an idea of just how rough that life is. RENT's ultimate message is one of hope and gives even the most secure listener a new way to approach life. Open your heart and mind and put your life in motion with this RENT soundtrack. You'll be glad you did."
5,There are not enough words to describe how I love this musical,"Since Rent premiered on Broadway in 96, I have always had a fascination with Rent. What makes this musical so amazing is the chemistry among the cast members, the strength of the songs and passion put forth through the music. This is one musical where I recommend that you must listen to the entire album to really enjoy the music. There are a few songs, which stand out the most:Light my Candle - must see this song in personToday 4 U - absolutely funny song by AngelI'll Cover You - a beautiful duet between Angel & TomChristmas Bells - great medley of voicesI Should Tell You - moving duet between Mimi and RogerSeasons of Love - self-explanatoryWithout You - heart-breaking song by MimiI'll Cover You-Reprise - by far my favorite song, always get goosebumps when I hear this song"
4,"Surprisingly, The Original is not always better","I love Rent, and I first had seen this version, but then I listened to the 2005 version and found it much better. All the cast is the same except Tracie Thoms takes the role as Joanne and Mimi is played by Rosario Dawson. I was surprised that their version of the two characters much better to the ears. Mimi has been played sweet and rock like, and I found that the sweet fit the role better, let it be for you to decide, but the only difference is the roles of Joanne and Mimi which I found to be better in the 2005 recording."
2,Rent (1996 Original Broadway Cast),"Rent (1996 Original Broadway Cast)is the 1996 recording with the original Broadway cast. I must say that I was not so impressed with this so called awesome musical. The booklet contains all the lyrics, music notes and photographs form the time of the recording. A musical that is not nearly as good as I thought it would be. In fact I stopped listening to it after four tracks. Really strange and not that great. Not recommended. 2/5."
5,WOW,"I absolutely love RENT. I don't even know what to say about it. The music is so beautiful and so meaningful, it takes my breath away every time I listen to it. The messages are ones to live by, the characters are real, the music is wonderful...its the best. Also, you should see the musical. It is so great. WARNING: As wonderful as RENT is, it is not appropriate for children because of mature subject matter and lyrics. It is also not appropriate for you if you are someone with a closed mind who is not open to new ideas and subject matter usually not explored in musicals. No day but today! Viva la vie boheme. BUY THIS"
5,Complete Your CD Collection,No CD collection is complete until you have the Original Broadway Cast Recording of Rent. This is a superbly produced album with some of the best songs ever written for musical theater. The casts' voices are just phenomenal. I find myself listening to this CD almost every single day. There are a lot of great messages about life to learn from this album - NO DAY BUT TODAY!!!
5,Rent= Nuff Said,"Rent is by far the best book, soundtrack, musical, and any othher item about rent in the world. if you miss this cd i swear you will regret this for the rest of your life. It is anmazing, breath takeing and worth every penny, i swear you'll like it."
5,THE BEST CD IN THE WORLD!,"Excellent! RENT is the greatest musical in the entire world! I've seen it two times and counting with Daphne Rubin-Vega in LA and let me tell you, if you love the show, you'll love this CD!!!!! I can't get enough of this CD! I can't wait for Daphne Rubin-Vega's new CD coming out this year by Mercury Records and Daphne's new movie, Flawless!"
5,Amazing!!,"This is a great cd and a must have for all-if you haven't seen it GO! It has amazing singing and dancing, and the acting is great. This cd will never leave your stereo"
5,BRILLIANT,"Did someone just say ""the genius of Lloyd Webber""? The best part of Rent is that it finally seperates the art of musical theater from spectacle, something which has infected our theater of everything after ""A Chorus Line"". Lloyd Webber's plays could be shuffled up and played in any order. This is where Jonathan Larson's genius shows through. He does not need falling chandeliers and pirotechnics to make a story. Rent is the best musical in the last twenty years. It will not grow to be a victim of its time like Hair; rather, it will grow like ""A Chorus Line"" did. Rent is not a play that deals with current issues so much as it deals with timeless issuse like human sexuality. Rent will live forever in the hearts of the millions of people that it has already touched."
5,Expressed my sentiments exactly!,"These were purchased to be guardian angels for my 3 adult daughters. They are a nice size and can be clipped to a car's visor, or even inside or outside of a purse. They appear to have a very sturdy clasp, so it should not come loose."
2,too large,Much too large!. I liked the piece. But my daughter refused to but anything that large into her car. we sent it back.
3,Gavisgon Review,"Product OK, but shipping was way overboard. The same as the product cost. Never again!!!"
1,"Slow, boring, no passion",The writing was slow and boring. There was no connection between the characters. I just really couldn't bring myself to care. The only reason I would keep this is that it looks like Rufus Sewell is one of the models on the cover.
1,"My Reveiw of ""The Old Demon""","Well, this book, though wonderfully written, is very boring for most young people of today. Some in the older generation may enjoy how the old Mrs. Wang is able to do so much in her old age, but there's no action or adventure that the youth of today long to read about."
4,Delivers exactly what it promises,This book promises faux surfaces and delivers them in spades along with lots of good projects and clear instructions. I would definately recommend this book to anyone serious about working in polymer clay.
5,"Easy to follow, even for a newbie","I'm brand-new to the wonders of polymer clay and I found this book to be really easy to follow. I've spent a lot of time looking at projects and ideas online, and I was happy to discover that this book covered a lot of things I haven't seen already. I made the agate slices from this book and they turned out amazingly realistic looking! VERY cool stuff in here, and every project has great instructions that anybody should be able to follow and get great results. (You will need a pasta roller for most of the projects.)"
3,Decent but not great,I was hopeful that this book would have some interesting new techniques for faux work. It does have techniques but they're sometimes scanty on the instructions and the projects tend to take up more space than the techniques themselves.I find it odd that amber is mentioned early in the book and shown in the gallery but there's no instructions for making it.I'm a huge fan of Sue Heaser and I think I'll stick with her books going forward.
4,extending ideas for clay artists,"If you want to explore ways of colouring clay, mixing,streaking, blending for surface effect. This book is a great start for ceramists and clay artists as the contents illustrates some patterns they can easily be applied to clay material."
2,Could have been better,"I can find some uses for this book, but overall it could have had more surface techniques and better resource references."
4,Finally a PC Recipe Book!,"I own nearly every polymer clay book that has been written but this one is going right up there with the new AnKara book! If you like to experiment and create your own treatments and techniques, this book is an excellent resource guide. Easy step by step instructions make it simple for anyone to have success with the included projects. What brings the most value to this book however, in my opinion, is the ""recipe"" format Irene has used. Every project lists out like a gourmet meal, with all the ingredients prefacing each project. Pictures are helpful but doesn't go far enough ... recipes are foolproof! I am sure this book will be dog-earred very soon as it has become my PC Bible of late. Thanks to Irene and all her co-conspirators :)"
5,Brings back carfree memories! Some hard-to-find hits!,"Anyone who grew up with Top 40 radio in the 50's and 60's will find these a pleasant surprise. Especially rare is Paul Evans' Seven Little Girls Sitting In The Back Seat, a top 10 hit in 1959 but virtually unavailable until now. Also Ne Ne Na Na Na Na Nu Nu by Dickey Do and The Don'ts from 1958 was a daily romp on American Bandstand, also very rare to find. And Got a Match from 1958 was another MOR silly ditty which was cool in its day, but never seen on CD until now. There's Hot Rod Lincoln, Baby Talk, Western Movies, I'm a Yogi and in all 25 wacko tunes early boomers will remember and love and bring back the times when the only thing you worried about was your science project or your school crush. Fun will never die! Great purchase!"
4,Looks great,"I bought this as a gift for someone, hoping the the picture was representative of the actual item. I was pleasantly surprised that despite the low price, the item looks great and it seems well made."
2,printing errors,"I ordered three copies of 'Fondues and Hot Pots' for Christmas gifts. One of the copies is fine. The second jumps from page 118 to page 215, then after the index jumps back to page 151. The third skips from page 118 to to page 183, then after 214 skips back to 151.This book would've gotten four stars (great recipes and hints, but absence of pictures costs a point), but people ordering this book need to be on the lookout for similar printing errors."
3,not worth the cost,"It's got a lot of good into but for what it is the price is a bit high, it should be sold for no more than $8"
3,"nice, but not what I expected","very small print wth alot of great info. Front and back cover filled with tips and hints. Useful if you know where to find everything, confusing if not."
5,Review of the ECG Pocket Brain book by Dr. Ken Grauer,Certainly a masterpiece! The ECG Pocket Brain makes ECGs easy. A concise and perfect learning tool and quick reference guide. Best ECG book I ever came across.I am a medical resident and I always carry ECG-PB in my pocket while on job.
5,FANTASTIC! Review of the ECG Pocket Brain book by Dr. Ken Grauer,"As a longterm charge nurse in the area of cardiology in a teaching hospital environment- I have used Dr. Grauer's products for nearly 20 years. They are uniformly outstanding. I especially like his ECG Pocket Brain book - because it is ""short and sweet"", and so very easy to rapidly find whatever information I am looking for in a few seconds. There is a tremendous amount of information in this small, easy-to-use book - and I recommend it highly. Dr. Grauer, Professor Emeritus of Family Medicine, is known nationally for his writings and teachings over many years in ECG/Arrythmia Interpretaton. Gail Coordsen"
2,REPRINT!!NOT NEW!!Love it but just know this before your buy,"I really love to get these for my wife, surprises are best when I give them to her, and she enjoys all of them from this great author, but she and I were not happy when I thought I found another of this super special Portal Series :-(. Having a new cover is nice but its a new publisher with nothing more than marketing in their minds, really hated to say this but we all know her books are super great, just know this is a reprint before you guy and like others, get a little ticked its not new after you fork over the cash and get your hopes up!Peace everyone :-)Jeff M"
1,Awful,"It was well written, but did not need so much profanity. She should've thought that maybe there were ten year olds out there who might read it. I was ten when I first read it. I'm disappointed, really."
5,Excellent background for the Joe Grey series,Many Joe Grey books hint at the world portrayed in the Catswold Portal - this provides excellent background information and is an entertaining novel in its own right.
3,A good book that could have been better,"While I DID enjoy this book, I felt kind of cheated by the end. There were so many side plots that just went nowhere and had no conclussion. It felt like the author was trying hard to just finish the story and so the plot felt very rushed. The ending is just begging for a sequel, just to sort out all the loose ends."
3,Enjoyable,"I needed a break from research reading one day and found this book at the local store before heading to the mountains to read it outdoors. It was the perfect book to sit in a lounge chair in the shade. As a cat person, I was drawn to the cover and the plot was, for the most part, enjoyable. A good, easy read for those looking for something light. Some of the sub-plots meandered a bit, but I figured it was a bit like a cat walking around a garden -- here and there. In the end, though, it was a nice break from the daily grind to read at one sitting."
4,The Catswold Portal,"I found this book to be exceptionally original. As a reader of SciFi Fantasy for over 25 years I can say that this one is a keeper.. ( I have just finished it for a 3rd time) The only problem I have is finding out if there are anymore books about the Catswold and the Netherworld, if not Ms Murphy should sit down and start writing them. So many of her books are also out of print. I can only say I will be heading for the library."
5,wonderful fantasy,"i love this odd and wonderful fantasy.I bought this book used and when it was a rare find, that makes it much for sweeter.I recommend this for anyone that loves fantasy and felines."
2,not attractive,"This book is interesting to read. However, the photos are in black and white (except for 10 plates) and their quality is really bad."
5,A Halloween HIT,"Regardless of whether your child ""knows"" all about Dora or not, this is a fun Halloween book. Its a lift the flap adventure, and there's all kinds of neat things to find under the flaps. The book design is rather clever, with my kids' favorite part being the end where some of the Dora characters are dressed in various costumes and you have to lift the flap to see who is wearing them. Very cute! It's also a sturdy board book so no worries about having bent or torn pages. A must have for any preschooler who is learning about the fun of Halloween."
3,Dispirited Berlioz,"These performances are surprisingly flat and listless, compared with those by someone like Beecham. The idea that you could have Berlioz overtures without driving energy and high spirits is an original one, I suppose... Really not recommended; I'm getting rid of my copy in favor of Beecham's classic recordings of them."
4,"I really like the case, but there is one major flaw.","I use this pelican case to house my audio technica m550 headphones. I looked into other cases and this one just seemed to be the best. The build of the case is solid, but it is very difficult to open the latches. Other than that, the case is very good.Yes, I would recommend it to a friend."
3,good for,to small for camera eq....good for pistol only. it will hole a cannon t2i with two lens or a go pro with all the odds and ends
3,DSLR Does not fit,This is an ok case it doesnt feel as solid as I thought it would but still pretty good how ever it DOES NOT fit myNikon D7000 unless I remove all the foam which means the camera would just be all over the place... I think im going to use it to house 3 contour roam cameras or maybe 3 sb700 speed lights IDK yet...Pros- good casesmalllightlooks goodcame really fast (7 days before it said it was going to) (Im in Indy)the foam smells kinda like coconutCons- Does NOT fit my Nikon D7000not as B.A feeling in the hands as I thought it would belatches are stiff and not easy to open yet
1,Don't buy this,"it was too small for my canon 5D mark II and the worse thing was amazon didn't let me return this item at all.the only way my camera could fit if i detach the lens and flash but i don't like that to do each time i use, even this way this case could hold body, lens and 1 extra battery no charger or etc. now i kept this without reason like trash. buy the one that you can return."
3,terrible to open by hand,Wish their engineers could have thought to lengthen the the locking handlesso that opening the box wouldn't require so much effort and cause so much pain.
4,Pelican 1200 Case with Foam,"An awesome case so far. I've used it to transport camera gear as well as pistols as checked luggage. Seems to be more than up for the challenge of protecting any equipment.There is enough room in this case for a DSLR camera and 2-3 lenses (1-2 if you include a telephoto), or 1 pistol (eg. Govt 1911) with holster, magazines and small box of ammo.The only negative that I can see so far is that this version of the Pelican cases doesn't have metal reinforced padlock holes. The locks I used dug into the plastic from being thrown around in transit on the last flight. I don't think they're going to break or anything, but the padlock holes definitely took a beating."
5,Perfect for handgun,"I bought this as a handgun case for a Glock 23 and it fits perfectly with room for 1 (or 2 if you squeeze them close) 10 roung mag. It is tough, discreet, waterproof, and can take a quality padlock for security."
3,To Small,"This a good case for some, I was going to use it for a DSLR camera, it is to small for this use."
3,Drunken Tai Chi,"This product comes in a very cheap and skinny case. It is dubbed really poorly and you loose some of the content during at least one scene. The sound quality fades in and out during the opening credits, but is steady throughout the rest of the film. Remember, you get what you pay for. Otherwise, a good movie."
3,Good toy,This honestly isn't exactly what I'd wanted but I didn't know that until it came. My child still likes it which was the whole point but a lot of other Kohl's Cares toys have been $5 each and this was almost $20. I don't know what they were new either though.
5,Epic. Apocalyptic. Majestic.,"This is a bold and profound blues recording by a group of incredible musicians who play like they mean it. It is as good as anything Muddy's done, and that's the highest praise I can imagine. It really is ""hard,"" both in the forcefulness of the playing and in the incredible recording itself. Johnny Winter proves himself an amazing producer with the sound he captures here - everyone on the same room and sounding clear and distinct while wailing like a great band in a sweaty blues joint. I'm not sure I ever heard drums recorded better - turn this up and it will rock your soul. As far as arrangements or anything like that, there's nothing fancy. Everyone (except Pinetop Perkins, but especially James Cotton) seems to play all the time, through every song. It's the overwhelming, irresistable force of the band and of Muddy Waters himself who make this classic, though. A great, hard, loud blues album. Six stars."
3,Fine for the price,"Works fine, you get what you pay for. Used it for a couple of days and it worked fine. No complaints, it just seems cheaply made, I would guess a few weeks of use and I would be annoyed with it, but for occasional use it is fine."
3,Super Reader,"Buffy has a problem with a queen vampire who is around 2000 years old, and her crazy lover. They go in for the magic potion make the town crazy thing, and arena fighting involving innocent victims.They date from the time of Caligula, and have been hunting and killing Slayers for a long, long time. They capture Oz, figuring he will be good entertainment, too.They also have a thing for the summoning of Caligula favorite dark goddess, which is not good."
3,The Evil That Men Do lives after them...,"the good is oft interred with their bone...This book is fairly good, but I think that the mob parts were slightly overdone. Also, I didn't think Helen's supposed history with Angel worked. It's not something that I see as believable.What I did like a lot were the flashbacks... It was very interesting how like a slayer and how like Buffy Helen's attitude was as a gladiator. I can see how she was seduced by Julian.But one thing really bothered me the entire time... Helen and Julian are total Spike and Dru rip-offs. And a lot less cool.(I mean really, the blond ""englishman"" completely devoted to the dark haired insane vampire that fancies herself in love with Angel. It's all very blatant.)"
3,"Starts Off Good, Gets Incredibly Cheesy, & Ends Off Okay","This book started off magnificentally and for the first 100 pages it was very good. Yet, their are a lot of flashbacks dealing with the two lead vampires that are incredibly cheesy. The dialouge in many places is weak and this book just didn't seem to fit in with the events of season three, even though it is up to date. The characterization was good, but I think it would of worked tremendously better if Christopher Golden would of co-written it with Nancy Holder. There are parts when it is very, very bad, but keep reading because while the ending is anticlimatic (as most Buffy books are), it's still much better than the middle of the book. All in all, an average read."
1,Not very good,"In this book it was kinda boring at the begining, and then it got even more boring. I think this is worse than the 5th one!"
5,The best Buffy book so far,I have read A LOT of Buffy books and this one took me off guard by how great it was. The story was compelling and comparable to the best that the writers of the show have turned out. But mostly the characters were perfectly captured adding believablity and spice to the novel. Read it!
3,Peridot Lever Back earrings,I ordered these earrings for a friend for her birthday knowing she would love them. She certainly did and they look lovely in her ears. I did expect the earrings to be a bit heavier for the money but they were good.[...]
5,Sunshine,I absolutely loved the tv movie and the book. I have been searching for the movie for such a long time. If anyone has any sources please let me know. Also there was a second movie called Sunshine Christmas. I know it had Barbara Hershey in it. Please contact me at Lprice2333@aol.com. Thanks
5,BEST BOOK EVER,"I read this when I was a teenager and it made me cry for hours, in the best way possible. Her love for her daughter is indescribable -and even though she chooses to not undergo treatment, you know she's doing it for the right reasons. She wants to be able to live her life without being held back by treatments that make her sick and make her angry - she wants her daughter to love her and remember her before she loses her.The poetry in the novel is beautiful. I have never found a book that can make me get so sentimental every time I read it. Please find this book and read it - and then pass it along to friends!!!!"
5,Shineshine a fantastic novel by Norma Klein,I read this book when i was 15 and could not put it down untill i reached the end. It was hands down the best book i have ever read. The booked touched me on an emotional level like no other has before and i recomend it to anyone. You will laugh and cry but come away feeling a great passion and love for life! Its a fantastic story.
2,Not great!,This product needs to be firmly attached to drawer or it slides around. Not at all what i thought. Knives also don't sit well in holder..
3,Not the best,"These holders for some reason do not really align when I try to line up the little notches on the bottoms. I also can't get them to stay put in my deep drawer, they are always sliding back. They hold the knives upwards nicely which I like, but I need to figure out how to better utilize them/arrange them perhaps?"
2,Not that great.,"Sounds and looks like a great idea, but when I used them they seemed very flimsy and slide around my drawers a lot. They do hold knives in a nice downward postion but other than that I don't see a benefit over a standard organizer which is probably what I will replace this with."
4,Does a great job of organizing my knives,"I am really excited about the fact that I can find the right knife immediately when I open the drawer. They are easy to see and the safety factor is welcome. I was always afraid of getting cut rummaging around in the drawer for the right knife. I realized I have a ton of the little paring knives, I could never find one so I kept buying them. They were all at the bottom back of the drawer, now they are right in the front and very handy, so I won't waste money buying extras anymore!The only reason it gets 4 instead of 5 stars is that it could be improved by putting some rubber or something on the bottom. My teenage daughter tends to slam drawers and the knives slide toward the back. I plan to put a rubberized drawer liner in my knife drawer under my organizers, and that should do the trick."
4,Compact and comprehensive,"The Pocket Oxford Duden Dictionary is a compact German-English dictionary that is more comprehensive than other paperbacks. It includes many compound words that are not available in competing products, though its coverage of verb forms and current terms is limited. It is a compromise useful for those that want a serious dictionary, yet an affordable and portable one."
1,Hollywood thinks you're an idiot,"Terrible movie and not only because of the subject matter.If you were in the FBI and some strange guy tells you that the stolen ambulance he drove to the station contains his dead brother, wouldn't you check it out instead of cruising around town listening to his life-story?And the whole movie is based on Sunday School theological ""dilemmas"". ""Sister Mary, if God tells me to kill, should I?"" Please.""You're killing people!""""I'm destroying demons!""*ad nauseum*You know every direction this film is going to take before it happens, there are no surprises, despite the now requisite ""twist ending"".After about 15 minutes I didn't care any more, but I suffered through this piece of crap until its horrible end.You're smarter than this. Please don't buy or even rent it."
5,frailty,"This movie is awesome , it has suspense and drama and a great twist in the story that keeps you guessing. i borrowed this movie and watched it twice before i returned it and couldnt stop thnking about it so i had to buy it. its one of those movies that makes you think could this really be true its weird and kinda scary all in one i enjoyed it alot!"
5,Best Horror movie in years,"I have seen just about every horror flick out there and had lost hopes for anything new to come along. Then, right alongside a Japanese flick I watched recently called ""My Blue Weapon"" (only a guess, as they were the only English words on the case), FRAILTY comes along and is easily categorized (in my opinion) as the best horror movie to come along in a good long time. Congratulations to Paxton and all involved. Chilling and unrelenting, FRAILTY is a true classic in a genre that needed some proper attention. No pun intended, but Bill Paxton delivers in spades. Wow, what a film."
5,Blow your mind away,This is the best movie I have ever seen.This is the most under rated movie I have ever heard of.If you like the Sixth Sense with Bruce Willis then this is the movie for you.This movie will make you laugh and keep you on the edge of your seat.And towards the end you will be like WHAT? Then you will be like. SAY WHAT? Then you will be like...........OH MY GOD! Unbelievable.Just when you think they have made every movie out there possible to what the mind can come up with.They do it again with something more different and entertaining.
2,Confused message...nothing special,"The film in the first half hour to hour pans out well and gets the viewer intrigued in the story. Unfortunately, by the end, it leaves you with a very confusing, silly and unneccessary message/ending. Paxton's acting is awful too. Buy? Don't even rent, wait till TV."
2,"McConaughey's cute, but Paxton does not deliver","First of all Bill Paxton delivers his lines like he is made out of stone. He is unbelievable at best. Secondly, what is meant to be a plot twist fizzles and leaves the audience still wondering what happened. We are supposed to believe that Fenton, who is so against his father's killings, grows up to be a serial killer. This just doesn't work. The only thing that would have saved this movie is if Matthew took his shirt off."
2,It's Greek to Me,"I'd been wanting to see this movie because I haven't been able to find a review that tells what happened. Well, I've now seen the film, and I still don't know what happened. I'd never seen any of the actors before, so I didn't know who was playing whom. Now I see that Matthew McConaughey was Adam, but he told the FBI agent that it was his brother Adam who had killed all those people. I thought I understood what was going on during the boys' childhood, but during the grown-up scenes I became completely confused. My husband and I even watched the last part twice, but it didn't help. I guess I'll go to my grave without any answers regarding this film."
3,WHY WAS POWERS BOOTHE A BAD GUY??,"FIRST OF ALL THE MOVIE WAS GREAT, BUT THE LAST TEN OR SO MINUTES SUCKED...HOW IS IT THAT A COP THAT HAS A PICTURE OF HIS MOTHERON HIS DESK MEAN HE KILLED HER??, I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY HAD TO DO THAT, THAT KILL THE MOVIE.WOULD IT HAVE BEEN BETTER IF THE COP (GOOD GUY AND NOT A MOTHER KILLER) FOUND OUT WHO THIS JERK WAS AND KICK HIS FAIRY [...]??, OR PUT A BULLET IN HIS HEAD AND BE DONE WITH IT??. SORRY...DOE'S THAT SOUND LIKE SOMETHING DOLPH LUNDGREN OR CLINT EASTWOOD WOULD DO??WHO CARES...GOD WOULDN'T WORK LIKE THAT ANYWAY."
1,What the heck?,"Okay I agree that this was masterfully acted and written but the content was the most disturbing I've seen in a while. If you're looking for this okay, but the review I read made this seem like a Sixth Sense or Others type of movie and that it is not. I couldn't sleep. Call me a wimp but this movie's vision of God's avengers just doesn't jive with me and my understanding of God. The scariest thing is I could see somebody twisted out there really believing this. If you think you want to see this please do society a favor and pay attention to the R rating. Do not let your impressionable teens watch this. God forbid they get the idea God really wants these type of avengers. I work in the Mental Health field with teens and believe me they could totally turn something like this movie into a ""holy crusade"" for themselves. Anyway, think over your beliefs maybe even pray before watching."
2,God's Voice Can't Be Wrong,"Expecting to see a ""triller"", this movie was anything but. The kids should have stayed the main focus. What was the message? It's alright to kill if you hear ""the voice of God""? The ending was too obvious - give the audience a little credit. It reeked of the Andrea Yeats murders with reverse parts for the kids."
1,Bill Paxton is no actor (or Director),"Bill Paxton appears to be constipated as he attempts to act. He is not fluid nor is he believable. He's got to be the worst working actor in the business (except for perhaps Adam Sandler). You just want to shake him or something everytime he speaks. And as far as his directing - nothing special at all.For the movie itself - convoluted plot, pointless in meaning, and very laughable."
1,A good movie with a grim message,"First of all let me say that it was a well-done flick. The O'Leary youngster was exceptional, but...The message of this movie is that there are demons on this world, and God can give any one of us a mission to destroy them. This is a message that it frightens me to hear at this time, with fundamentalist religious fanatics all over the earth running around killing people. The guys who killed 3000 people in New York were as religiously committed as the hero of this movie. And we have people in this country running around attempting to murder people, abortion doctors for instance, who believe they have a mission from God.I don't believe in censorship, nor have I ever thought that the material our entertainment industry gives us is damaging to normal minds. But a disturbed person can find a message in almost anything, and this message is NOT subtle.It might have been okay if the demon-killer had been damned, but I am very sorry that this film ever hit the screens."
1,The most unethical film ever made.,"This is the worst film ever made.When you read this review, you're going to think I'm exaggerating. Then you'll see the film and realize I'm being even-handed:This movie promotes the idea that atheists are demons, and that people who murder them with a lead pipe and an axe are doing the work of God, so much so that God will literally help them personally in their murderous effort.Now let me make this clear: I do mean ""demons"", that is literally the term used in the film. And I do mean a lead pipe and an axe. And I do mean that you literally see supernatural events occur that are presented in the film as the work of God, asisting those who murder atheists. And if you're watching the film and you're thinking how I've jumped the gun here- just wait until the end.This would have been a great film if it were made around the year 1200 A.D."
1,Laugh Out Loud Bad,"I haven't seen this in a while, but I remember it being jaw-droppingly bad. Bill Paxton's horrible performance, as well as the silly dialogue and plot made it laugh-out-loud funny. I really should see it again just to remember how bad it really is. I can't believe there are people that think it's a good movie, as a quick check found that the majority of critics admired it on its release. That's wacky."
1,Well-Made Apology for Religious Fascism,"Just what we need.Another Texas religious nut who hears the voice of God and starts killing people.Like David Koresh.Like George W. Bush.(To be fair, Koresh started the killing only when under massive onslaught by US forces.)If this were only a gory story about a religious crackpot who--with his two young sons--goes on a killing rampage, it would be merely sleazy.But no. It JUSTIFIES the grisly slaughter.It is like a documetary about Hitler that first shows in horrid detail the killing of 6 million Jews and 7 million others, and then says, ""But it's all right, because THEY DESERVED IT.""To be fair, the acting (particularly of the older son as a boy), the directing, the dialogue are super.All the more reason to give a shudder and avoid this apology for self-righteous killing."
2,"""Frailty"" An Appropriate Title","Where to begin? This movie has so many problems, beginning with a widowed father (played by director Bill Paxton) who suddenly becomes deranged before the viewer has a chance to even learn about the character. Follow this with an angel popping out of a muffler, an axe and gloves glowing from the beam of a heavenly light from above, a contrived ""gotcha"" ending, and an inexcusable character twist for the FBI agent (Powers Booth), and FRAILTY dissolves into psycho-babbling nonsense.One of the reviewers has tagged this movie ""a thinking man's horror film."" I would respectfully disagree. If you want to see a disturbing film that explores the complexity and subsequent fragility of the human mind, see ""Jacob's Ladder."""
2,Scariest movie ever made,"This is the scariest movie ever made. It is extreamely disturbing. I couldn't sleep for a few nights after seeing this. It is about a man who is trying to track down Gods hand. He thinks that whoever he meets in the street, in the store, etc is a demon. He tells his kids that he is just trying to protect them, but what he is really doing, is slaughtering innocent people for the fun of it. Don't watch this alone at night, unless you are feeling really brave. This is absolutly the scariest and most disturbing movie ever made. I will never see this movie agian."
1,this movie is pathetic.,"the first half of the movie was great... the last 10 or so minutes is a complete and utter farce! watching it i thought the main purpose of the movie was to show the neurotic behaviour of religious fanaticism... e.g. visions, missions, destiny, gOD's will etc... the ending makes me want to puke! this movie justifies psychotic fanaticism (god's will)!this movie is so revolting!!! its disgusting!!! no wonder there are so many serial killers the US with supposed ""missions"" from their all merciful god... its so damn pathetic. shame on people who give it 5 stars!!! for shame!!!"
2,Troubling in portrayal of religious,"If this movie had chosen to use a make pretend god as opposed to the real God I would not have had as much trouble with the movie.From the moment their father had a vision it was apparent that the movie was going to be unkind to the God-fearing. I was right. My friend, who does not go to church, loved the movie but I could not get beyond the idiot that was the boys father.Remove this aspect by let's say a tree talking to him then I would have believed it more.Despite this the movie has a couple of twists in the end that make the movie well written. I am still not recommending it."
1,Plain stupid,"Well, Paxton proved that can he can be a lousy director the same way he is a bad actor. That is all the merit this stupid mess have. By making one of the worst endings EVER in the history of movies, he destroyed the whole thing."
4,not a boring moment,What's it like when you have an angel giving orders? This thriller shows the pressure that the recpient feels. A real creepy movie not for the squeamish! Paxton is outstanding.
3,"original, appealing...delicious","This movie is yet another ""must see"" I will add to my list. Bill Paxton always does a heck of a job slipping into some of the most interesting of characters. This movie could very well be a reality. I won't go into the plot much, but with the world we live in, this situation could easily become real world something you would read about in the paper. It always has you thinking. It's not very scary, but mentally it keeps you watching as you bite your nails and slide off your seat.PROSoriginal, overall realistic.CONSif you think analytically, it might not be very realistic. but it gives the movie suspense.OVERALLbuy it, it's cheap now. you shouldn't regret it unless you only like comedies or horror."
4,Paxton goes all out with this disturbing and riviteing movie,"Bill Paxton (Titanic, Near Dark) stars and directs in this really horrific movie about a dad who gets the gift of god to kill demons in people. The way he does it, is he places his hands upon them seeing the crimes and sins that they have done in their life. Paxton, shows his 2 children by murdering these people in front of their faces. Years Later, grown up Fenton Meeks, played by Matthew McConaughey (Sahara, Reign Of Fire) who is truly outstanding in the role, visits a cop, played by Powers Boothe (Rapid Fire, Sin City), to tell him that his brother is the Gods Hand Killer adn tells him the story of his father and his childhood. The red herring at the end is great. Some disturbing parts probably will be hard to watch. Also starring Jeremy Sumpter and Melissa Crider (The Boy Names Hate)"
2,Highly frustrating,"""Frailty"" had great premise, great story, great acting... then about 20 minutes before the end, it totally shot itself in the foot.Someone said once that good directors start with the supernatural and slowly and subtly build to reveal the reality underneath (think Hitchcock's ""Vertigo""). Bad directors go the other way around. Well, this is a perfect example of bad directing. The ending was disappointing, nonsensical and, I felt, a major cop-out.It's still worth seeing if you're a fan of dark psychological thrillers that make you ask questions. But it's not for everyone. You might love it, but then again you might hate it. Be warned."
2,Not good at all,I'm a big fan of thriller/horror type movies and I figured that this one would be great. Was I ever wrong. This movie was terrible. There was no storyline and the idea behind it was awful. The movie was so very repetitive. I don't recommend this movie to anyone.
3,"Great concept, dangerous notion","I mostly loved this movie. The acting of Bill Paxton and the two boys playing Fentin and Adam Meeks was top notch. The plotline for the first 90% of the movie was harrowing and compelling. I felt cheated by the ""twist"" ending, however. (Don't worry, no spoilers here.) Another movie, the ""Sixth Sense"" had a twist that enhanced the overall story, and left you in wonder at how clever the whole thing was (and emotionally beautiful and true). Frailty's ending left me feeling cheated and angry that somebody would consider this a valid idea for a story."
1,Bill Paxton's Egomania,"Forcing two competent adult actors to overact so intensely that they telegraph the ""twist"" ending with every nuance, while keeping himself at a safe distance stiffly chewing the scenery like a godzilla beaver hovered over two naturalistic child actors. As for his direction, I understand Paxton may have lacked the money for crane, dolly, or handheld shots, but his refusal to pan, zoom, jump cut, or come up with a single interesting angle or establishing shot would be unacceptable even in 1950. Just one more bland clumsy atheist's demonization of all fathers."
4,Father and son conflict.,I have read many of the comments. Unfortunately I see something different in the movie. Two young boys are deeply affected by their fathers mental illness. Fenton opposes his father and pays the price. He is locked in the shed cellar and left to starve unless he conforms to his fathers demands. Ultimately Fenton kills his father in order to escape the terrible murderous life style. He has been so damaged he becomes alcoholic and is doomed to death by Adam who views him as evil.Adam never opposed his father and lived to carry on as a murderer just like his father. He chooses the role of a cop because as the FBI agent says he has the instincts of a cop.This movie is well worth buying. All the actors are outstanding. The theme for me is that the father figure can have a complex and enduring effect on their childrens' emotional and cognitive development.
5,Totally Original!,"Im am so pleased to see a movie that goes out of the norm, and this is by far the most original modern movie ive seen... and ive seen a lot! Definitely worth the money! SEE THIS MOVIE!"
4,Classic Thriller with a Chilling Twist,This was was a great thriller in the same stream as Usual Suspects. I love unsuspected endings! I need this for my collection.
5,One of the best movies I've ever seen.,I loved this movie so much when I saw it on Sci-Fi that 4 years later I finally found out the name and bought it.
3,Frailty......,This movie was just ok. Nothing that I would want to watch again or tell somebody to watch. It was one of those movies that never went anywhere.
4,Sick and twisted movie,"Frailty was to me a very intresting movie with some great actors in it but overall a sick and twisted plotline to bring the people into to see the movie. I personally loved the mixture of horror, and suspense triller elements thrown into it. But like some people your either going to love the movie or dislike it. I have now watched it twice in my lifetime, it is a very powerful movie and will keep you guessing but a few people didn't like the ending because in the end it will make you think was he really doing God's work by being the God's hand killer or where you what the heck is this ending for. I personally enjoy the whole moving inculding the ending to it because I like to think at end of some movies to see if I was right about who the killer is and or so forth. But if you need a good horror suspense triller movie then pick this movie up and be prepare for a very sick movie but with a great but twisted plotline."
5,brilliant film,"I loved this movie. it was creepy and a little scary but the main thing was it was a great story and and the filmmaking was superb. On the dvd, tricks of the trade were shown and i couldn't believe how easy some were. (like two flashlights looking like headlights) The plot was fastpaced all the way through and you find yourself not knowing whose side your on. you know soon enough though. I loved little quirky things about the film like the ""magical"" weapons dad recieved. (an axe named OTIS, a lead pipe and a pair of gloves.) I definately think this was one of the best films i've seen this year. i didn't understand one reviewer's comments. they said it was good, well done movie yet they gave it 1 star because it might make people go crazy or something. that jsut doesn't make since-if it's good, it's good, regardless of how some people might react. you can't rate a movie like that, if you like it you like it. Ok sorry i rambled a bit. watch this movie. you'll love it"
4,"Disturbing, yet you can't turn away","This movie is more of a physcological thriller, the story is told in narrative by Matthew McConaughey, flash backs to the time he was young and lived with his father and younger brother. I felt so disturbed by the father turning into for better lack of word, a fanatic demon killer. The transition is overnight, so you are left asking yourself is he crazy, he must be. Then he includes the boys in his crazy mission. At this point you really start to feel sorry for the boys, but then the movie takes a twist, that I didn't see coming. Everyone did superb acting in this movie, and I was quite surprised to have liked it so much."
4,"A Very Good, Solid Movie","Frailty is an excellent movie, very scary. It has a great plot that keeps you wondering right up to the credits. Bill Paxton shocked me, I wasn't aware of what an amazing actor and director he is. Of course if it weren't for the master of horror himself Stephen King, this movie would not be what it is (scary as hell). BUT beware it is very trying on your nerves and it is VERY repetative. I saw several people walking out of the movie do to some of the disturbing scenes."
4,redemption or hellfire,It's about a father of two sons who believes that God is directing him to destroy demons. It's about the two sons trying to decide if they believe or not. It's about the creepiest movie I've ever seen in my life. I get scared just thinking about it. Not because of blood and gore. That doesn't bother me. It's about the mental state the movie puts you in because in a way you are one of those two sons and whichever one you side with it's either redemption or hellfire.
3,Strange and eerie,Not what I was expecting at all. Not a lot of gore or action. Mostly psychological thriller. Single father of two gets religion after he claims god's angel comes to him out of the blue with a list to rid the world of demons. They're a poor family living in this little bush town on a dirt farm. Creepy setting. Starts off with one of the grown up sons going into the city to tell a detective he knows whose behind all the killings with flashbacks. You certainly don't feel sorry for the bad guys in the end.
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! -[...] - @tss5078,"This is a great cast in a terrible movie. McConaughey goes to the FBI with an eyewitness account of a notorious murder he witnessed when he was a kid. From there the whole movie is done in flashbacks, similar to The Usual Suspects. Sounds pretty good right? Nope! In The Usual Suspects, things happen, you were drawn into the story. Frailty doesn't have any of that. It's like watching one of these lame reality shows, that takes place inside some families home. Until the end nothing happens! ...finally you get to the end and you see something! My reaction to it was, 'that was it, that's what you were building up to this whole time!?' The trailer, the description, and the cast might suck you in, but seeing this movie is a waste of time."
3,Surprisingly funny,"I saw this movie yesterday, and the more I think about it, the more the plot seems like one of those Simpsons Halloween shows. Ned Flanders starts killing people saying he's destroying demons and then. . . TWIST --- the joke's on you.The tone of the film is actually pretty serious, involving child abuse and decapitation, with lots of rain and fog and shadows, and very scary music. I was terrified during the credits at the beginning. I was chuckling at the end.It almost feels like the director couldn't decide if he wanted to make a truly disturbing psychological thriller, or a camp horror/comedy. I feel certain that the very final scene was played for laughs.By the way, I don't normally find violence amusing. I cover my eyes during Itchy and Scratchy."
3,"Surprising, for Hollywood","I have to admit, this one is a slight change from your typical Hollywood morality film. It's fairly dark, but only somewhat unteresting... it really didn't keep my attention, like a good Lynch or Hitchcock movie. Frailty offers a unique perspective at fundamentalist religions, though I dont see that as the focus of it. Worth a viewing, though not a purchase."
2,VERY DISTURBING,"...I for one, love thrillers and somewhat horror movies, but this one crossed the line (I guess i'm not your average Stephan King lover)..This movie really puts you in a mental shock, who can think or come up with such a story?I have to admit though, that the acting was top class.. Paxton does a great job being the loving father and a loyal Christian, the kids too are superb..But I will never watch this movie again, and nor would I recommend it full heartedly to anyone."
3,good but predictable,i like this mvie because its the kind of movie that stays in your end for days afterwards. the perfomances of the two kids a great. however i felt it was a teeny bit predictable i could guess most of the big suprises.
4,"Great compilation, great merengue mix","If you purchase this compilation cd, you will be listening to some of best merengues that were released in 1999 and 2000. The cd was wonderfully compiled with merengues from some of the greatest singers of this category. All the songs are danceable, upbeat and rhythmic. If you don't have music from all of these singers, the cd gives you the opportunity to sample the different styles of merengue that is unique to each artist. I highly recommend this purchase to all merengue fans. Great compilation cd!"
3,Not what I had hoped,"I guess I should've expected this, but this dictionary is organized by the romanization of the Korean words. Also, I'm a huge fan of Korean dramas, so I know some Korean words. I know that there are, for instance, quite a few ways to say ""I'm sorry."" I had hoped this dictionary would shed some light on why different words might be used in different situations, but then I found that it actually only includes *one* way of saying ""I'm sorry,"" and it was one of the less common ones that I hear on the dramas. So I was a bit disappointed with this dictionary because it's not one for someone seriously interested in getting to know the Korean language, but if you just want a quick reference to see word meanings and you don't mind romanization, then you may be satisfied with this product."
3,It's ok,I thought the dictionary would be a little bigger than it actually was. But I guess it's not called a POCKET dictionary for nothing...
2,aunthentic Art DecoJewelery Designs: 837 Illustrations,good for student review but not for the designer of serious modern jewelery
1,Worst running shoes ever!,"I normally love asics running shoes, but this pair is the least comfortable asics shoes I've ever tried. Very disappointed with the quality of the shoe and the comfortness of it. Do not buy it, you will hate it too! If you want a pair of shoes to just walk in, may be ok but don't plan on this shoe making your feet happy."
2,1911,"While this film did somewhat show that Jackie Chan is a very good actor and the photography was exceptional, it proved to be too disjointed to be,concerning the subject,""entertaining"". Whoever selected the cast went out of their way to find an ""American"" that either was naturally pathetic or was inclided to betray American's as pathetic. The first hint this was a Chinese Comm. propaganda film was the reluctance to show the revolutionary army's battle flag fully extended. The very last line in the film claimed the whole revolution was the effort of the Communists who,truth be told, did not exist for many years after the fact and had no role in 1911. This may be the reason it seemed so much was cut out. Perhaps the ChiComms deleted all materiel' that was contra to thier propaganda. The quality of the sets and the action scences are first-rate, however. The effort,on a whole,resulted in a waste of time and money when anything Jackie Chan and/or Joan Chin should be at least worth otherwise."
1,Really?,"In my opinion, this is one of Jackie Chan's weakest movies. The pace of the movie left no room for actor play and character development. Unless someone understands the history of what was happening in China in 1911 (which I do not), it is hard to make sense of what is going on in the movie. There is an attempt to put the explanation and commentary on the screen, but the font is so small, it is impossible to read in regular definition resolution. After watching the movie I have no more knowledge or understanding of what happened in China in 1911. I also could not bring myself to connect with any of the characters.The biggest thing that just escapes me with this movie, though, is this. Does Jackie Chan really believe that the revolution was a good thing for China and that Communism has anything good to offer? Was the movie a piece of propaganda forced onto him by the Chinese government (which would explain why the movie is so bad)? I just do not get it."
2,Chinese communist propaganda,"Interesting historical subject matter, good production values, but ... blatant Chinese communist propaganda.According to the film, the Qing dynasty was corrupt, and therefore had to be taken down. Only then could freedom, peace, and prosperity break out in China. And the work did not end with the 1911 revolution; it was continued by the communist revolution some decades later. Apparently the communists carried forward the spirit of the 1911 revolution and brought about the ""rejuvenation of the state"". The revolutionaries were virtuous, those who died were martyrs, their work was glorious, etc. etc. etc.Read some history books and check out communist China's human rights record, and you'll get an idea of the communist version of freedom, peace, and prosperity. Then watch the movie and enjoy a glimpse of a unique piece of world history - and a taste of communism at work in the present."
2,doesn't rise above being a propaganda film,"Purely a propaganda film and, while beautifully filmed and mostly well acted (with some exceptions among the American characters), doesn't rise above being a propaganda film."
1,Propaganda,Disjointed movie. Bad Chinese propaganda linking the 1911 revolution for democracy to the 1949 communist revolution that installed a dictator government. Jackie Chan sold out.
2,I really wanted to like this but . . .,"I just watched this on Netflix - well most of it - and was disappointed. I like historical movies and Jackie Chan but it was very difficult to keep up with this film, much less have an understanding of what was happening. It took me a few minutes to realize that the Chinese characters and English subtitles on the sides of the screen were to identify the participants, not the actors, mostly because I was trying to keep up with the dialogue subtitles. Then the screen started displaying more and more information - descriptions of the timeline and actions. Now, I am an avid reader and have a decent reading speed but I just could not keep up with three separate groups of text running simultaneously with the action. The acting seemed decent, the production values great but I felt like I should have read a book first. My memories of this time period in China from World History classes are 40+ years old. Finally turned it off."
5,Great Film,"I teach World History to a bunch of sophomores and was looking for something to show them that had all the major people in the Revolution of 1911. This is a great time piece, acting is wonderful - even with subtitles, story line is quick and easy to follow along, and the action scenes are blended nicely to keep a 15 year old invested in the film."
1,1911,"Historical epics have been a part of Chinese cinema for a long time, and now that Jackie Chan has grown just a tad too old to pull the insane stunts of his youth, it makes sense that his latest film, his first directorial effort since 1998's Who Am I?, is 1911, a historical drama about the Xinhai Revolution, which overthrew China's last imperial dynasty. Released on the 100th anniversary of the revolution and marking Chan's 100th film, 1911 was unfortunately a failure here in the States, where it took home just over $135,000 at the box office is one of the worst films of Chan's career. The problem, is that the film relies too heavily on title cards to explain already convoluted plot points, rendering the proceedings more akin to a history lesson than a piece of entertainment. If you aren't already familiar with the story taking place, you may find 1911 tedious, overlong, and dry, three words you'd never have thought to associate with a Jackie Chan movie."
5,Well worth the money!,"I was provided this model in the hospital after I lost most use of legs. It's very lightweight but durable for a big guy. Folds up easily, comes with inside and outside tips that are easy to take off. Excellent item for the money."
4,Great for my Mom,I bought this walker for my 97 year old mom. She uses it daily and it has held up pretty well. We take it with us when we go anywhere in the car. I also bought a tray that fits over the handles and she likes that pretty well too.
3,Good product,"I ordered this product for my wife and she loves it, but the packaging was not very good and the binding was damaged in the mail. With a little work I was able to repair it and keep it."
1,WHY WASTE A CHILD'S TIME ON THESE? THEY WERE AWFUL IN THE EARLY 50'S AND THEY HAVEN'T IMPROVED!!!,"When I first had these readers assigned to me in 1953 they were the most boring books I ever read or have read thereafter. ""Mother"" stays home and wears dresses. ""Father' goes to work. In 1953 I don't remember many families like that, and for sure today's children are not being reared in that style. I cannot imagine how awful and strange these books must seem to children who now have instant information accessible to them via computers and the Internet. To compare then and now, nowadays children are often (not all school districts) expected to be able to read before they start kindergarten. Back then, when we started kindergarten we were taught to count from one to ten and learn ""to say our ABC's"". I was very disappointed to see these books are still around! Go, Go, Go, Run, Run, Run, Vomit, Vomit, Vomit! And to all of you who also gave them one star, Clap, Clap, Clap! You are wise people."
5,brings back my childhood,My grand-daughter is learning to read and was so excited to have a book that was easy for her to read. It brought back fond memories for me as I sat her on my lap to read.
3,A Bit Clunky,"Many who read the newspaper series by Elizabeth Coblentz will likely enjoy this book more than I did. But for me it had a very clunky delivery. This is not Elizabeth's doing, but rather falls on the publisher of the book.There are far too many things going on...from recipes to stories from Elizabeth to snipits of her favorite poems to commentary from the Editor....it become jumbled and provides a rather clumsy reading experience. The recipes themselves are strong and are a good collection to have.I would highly recommend the book written by Elizabeth's daughter, Lovina, titled ""The Amish Cook at Home"". It had a much more reader friendly and relaxed style while having a definate direction."
2,Pretty but disappointing,"Though the pictures are beautiful & the stories interesting, I was very disappointed in this book and it's recipes. As a matter if fact, there are very few recipes. I was looking for authentic Amish foods like Sticky buns, which they show a picture of but have no recipe for. I was not expecting vegetable & breakfast pizzas or spagetti & meatsauce!!!! I never knew pizza was Amish!!!! Stick with Phyllis Pellman Good if you want real Amish fare!! (I think this book should have been about photography)."
5,Awesome,This book really helped me get the basic understanding of the rules of Spanish. The class I was taking was really advanced and the teacher was going really fast.
4,very helpful,"I learned about this book from some adult students who found it very helpful. It's very good for analytical types (like me!) who want to know about and better understand the ""mechanics"" of English and Spanish grammar."
3,A good Intro,"This book is a great into to the shadow government. It will wet the appetite as to the extent of what goes on behind the scenes. However, there are more complete works in this genre written by people like Jim Marrs, David Icke, and DVD's by Alex Jones that are much better and worth the money."
4,Relaxing and soothing,I highly recommend this CD especially to those people who are just starting out to explore the world of jazz music. This album is truly entertaining and will not bore anyone.
3,Decent effort...,"There's nothing new here. A typical KKSF (San Francisco), KJZY (Santa Rosa,CA), WCDJ (Boston), KTWV (LA),WSJT( Tampa) type CD. Don't get me wrong. I love Smooth Jazz... for what it is. I was drawn to this CD after hearing the collabo' with Shai on one of my all-time favorite songs "" A Song for You"". Nice to hear Shai get some new work as their first CD back in 1992 is special to me harking back to the days when I was a freshman in college serenading their songs to the young ladies in Olivia Davidson Hall at Tuskegee University. You've no doubt heard ""Car Wash 2000"" on your local Clear Channel Smooth Jazz Station. Decent effort there. I also liked "" Use Me"". If you like Smooth Jazz, you'll like this CD... Nothing special... just another CD to add to the 300 disc player to add to your shuffle play during a BBQ party on the back deck."
4,Read me first!,"This is a great book to have on hand before you have to ask the CIO ""what do you know about.......?"" The authors are able to cover almost all current call technologies while keeping up a brisk pace. This book provides a good reference source as well as a start to finish review of a variety of technology.The acronym and glossary sections at the back of the book will prepare you for even the most technically baffling sales presentation."
5,"""Must-have"" reading for IT managers who support Call Centers","Coming from a applications management background, this book really helps me wrap my brain around the world of CTI. I especially appreciate the authors' pragmatic approach to ""more is not necessarily better""."
5,Finally! A Call Center Reference book for the rest of us!,"In short, this book delivers what the title promises. Once read, this book now occupies an easy to reach spot in my office. I recommend this book for anyone that manages agents or technology in a call center or that markets to the industry. Thank you to the authors for demystifying call center technology in a consise and fun format."
1,TERRIBLE!!,"got this product for my birthday this past year in april. started using it and it was awesome!that lasted about a month. the ipod docking station stopped working. if i plugged my ipod into it the speaker they wouldn't recognize it and no music would play. had to switch to using the adapter plug in the back.took hercules about 2 months to finally give me an address to send my defective speaker back to.took them another month to send them back to me. when i got them i plugged my ipod into the docking station and it started charging, yay!well not, i pushed the button to turn the speakers on and nothing happened. unplugged it and plugged it back in. still nothing.This same exact problem with the ipod docking station happened to him as well."
3,So-so gadget,"I used these to make egg mcmuffins. They definitely need to be sprayed with PAM or some cooking spray prior to use, as they tear the side of the egg when you go to remove the ring. So they should not be billed as ""Non-stick"".Also, a little clunky to store. You can put all four together with the clip they give you, but I don't have room to store that way, so I take them apart."
4,Works,I bought this because it was on sale and I normally have to make many eggs at a time and figured this would help get more eggs into one pan. It does just that! When sprayed with oil nothing sticks to it and it works perfectly. The only down side is that the handle is plastic and comes apart easily. I wasn't expecting it to do that but I do like that it is detachable So I don't have to dirty the whole thing if I just want 1 or 2. I do recommend that you spray it down and heat it up in the pan before using so that you don't have any leaking from underneath. It's not meant to be leak proof
2,Non-stick? Really? In what way?,"They ARE egg and pancake rings. They do the job ... sort of.But, to claim that they are in any way ""non-stick"" is either a sizable stretch of the imagination or outright fraudulent advertising. The coating on these things looks to be simple, hard black enamel paint - no Teflon coating or any other ""non-stick"" surface. Don't believe the hype. You will need to butter or oil them every time you use them.The little handle that keeps them all together is a bit flimsy and the rings themselves flop around constantly. That's fine when they are dry to keep them together but when they are hot and your eggs are stuck to them - and they will stick without pre-treatment - the whole contraption becomes quite unwieldy and a bit hazardous to handle and deal with.Other than that, the price is right. With a little preparation the major pit-falls can be avoided and the objective achieved. Just like the Boy Scout motto says, be prepared.LJ"
4,Works great,"I was looking for a way to make a batch of English muffins in my electric skillet all at once (2 sets). They won't all fit if I leave the handles on, plus they are hard to fill with the handles in place. Since they are a little flimsy with the handles on it works best to just separate them. That way they all fit and are easy to fill. I end up with enough batter to make one more muffin, so it would be ideal if they were a little deeper, but all in all they work great and I'd buy them again. The batter doesn't stick and they are pretty easy to clean."
4,Egg McMuffins at home,"My son and daughter are HUGE fans of the Egg McMuffin and wanted to make them at home . So when we found these great little items we ordered them, recieved them quickly and have used them frequently. They work as designed although we found that some eggs (maybe from a different farm?) stick just a bit. To solve this minor problem we just run a butter knife at a slight angle to free them. Again this happens rarely. Great product."
2,Not as thrilled as hoped,I purchased this item to cook eggs in an isolated location. The rings are not very heavy and did not sit well in the pan and egg whites seeped easliy underneath and created more of a mess than a round fried egg. I would believe the same thing would occur with pancakes. This item needs to be made of a heavier material to sit on the pan and not allow leaking.
1,But what if you only one one or two eggs?,"I bought this for my husband who likes egg sandwiches. Typically he would only need one or two eggs, which do not work well with the holder. Everything sticks to the rings, you need a really big, flat pan to use them. If you only want to use one, then how do you pick it up? Too cumbersome to use for us."
3,EGG/PANCAKE RING SET,I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE I HAVEN'T USED MINE !IF YOU COOK ON A FLAT GRIDDLE AND COOK A LOT OF EGGS/PANCAKES IT WOULD PROBABLY WORK FINE !BUT I COULD NOT USE MINE EFFICIENTLY IN A SKILLET !
2,Not Good,Threw away eggs stuck every time I used it. These were not stick free I even sprayed with pam and still the eggs stuck.
1,Bad egg,The nonstick 4-piece egg/pancake ring set was cheap. It leaked all the egg out the bottom on each holder. Poor and chinsy design.
3,not 100% non-stick,"it is not 100% non-stick. if you decide to return, it will cost 1/2 of what u paid for. plastic handle"
5,love my eggs,I love this product. The eggs look great and cooks a lot better. I know I'll never go back the old way of cooking
2,money waste,This is a toy for kids to fix them a breakfast. Not for adults - too small. Waste your time and money.
5,Perfect pancakes,"I've made pancakes with our new pancake rings and they worked great! They did not scratch the pan, are non-stick and make perfect pancakes!"
2,Awkward,Ordered these to do multiple eggs for egg muffins...they are awkward to use..rings have a lift handle which isn't worth the time fiddling with. I used the rings individually without the handle. Just a so-so item.
5,Love it!!!,This has made my eggs look like they were made in a restaurant I love it. My husband loves it too.
3,Egg/Pancake Ring Set - Good Buy,I have used this set twice since I received it. It has worked well for both the eggs and pancakes.Clean up was easy in the dishwasher.
2,CRAP,"this thing is soo cheesy and the handle is made out of plastic. It does not even stay together long enough to pick it up and place it in the pan, you have to assemble it in the pan pretty much"
2,Not very stable ring holder,"The rings are a nice size but they are not stable on the ring holder. The holder doesn't hold them well and they fall off very easily. For example, the four rings are held together by a small push in clip that easily slips loose. I was disappointed in this product."
1,Needs a lot of Improvement,"Don't let the non-stick fool you. the first few times I used the rings, the eggs would come up with it. I use a little margarine on my finger and spread it around the rings and it solves that problem. Another problem is that the eggs will leak through the bottoms of the rings. I live with that and use the flat side of a butter knife and press down a little before I remove the rings. I think they could certainly improve this item. I would rather pay more for a heaver set."
4,"Not totally effective, but will work","These are not truly non-stick rings. I have to spray them with cooking spray before using them for eggs. Also, the eggs come from under the ring. Overall, they do the job."
2,"Love the idea, but the nonstick doesn't deliver","I had been looking for egg rings (without knowing what such a thing was actually called) for a long time before I happened upon these babies. As soon as I saw them I knew they were exactly what I had been looking for and ordered them on the spot. Unfortunately, my glee turned sour when I tried to use my new egg rings.A lot of people report they haven't had a problem with sticking, but that is not consistant with my experience. Eggs stick to virtually everything, and these rings are no exception. Trying to remove the ring and flip the egg is a pain, usually I flip the ring and the egg flips with it, and then I have to cut the egg away from the ring so it falls down to the pan."
1,Low Carb Cook,"Rings are a good idea, but the handle is poorly constructed on the set I got and does not fit the center and therefore is useless. With no other handle these are difficult to use. I would not buy again."
1,Poor design,"I was disappointed to find that this contraption is very flimsy and not rigid.The rings flop around and can easily fall off.The handle is low and wide and gets in the way.The rings are small and are sized for english muffins (3.5"" dia).They are too small for pancakes and large bagels.There also tends to be leakage under the ring when using scrambled eggs.I've abandoned the handle and just use a pair of tongs to lift the ring off.Next time I'm going to try the Silicone Egg Ring by Trudeau (4"" dia)."
2,Disappointing,"An individual ring is best. Used all four this morning and egg yoke leaked from the bottom of each as I broke each egg into the rings. When I lifted the set from the handle the whole thing came apart. Have used it earlier for one egg and it was fine, sized perfectly for muffin or bagel. Good concept but needs work for four eggs at a time. Might work for a pancake sandwich but I'm not going to try it."
1,Flimsy P.O.S.,"This is a flimsy plastic piece of garbage. The rings themselves are metal but the handle is plastic. The rings aren't secured each other or even to the handle very well for that matter. This thing seems to fall apart by just looking at it, let alone trying to use it."
4,egg ring set,"this is great in camp for sausage/ham breakfast sandwiches. would still use non stick spray with this ring. i don't use the handle, more hassle than what i use this for."
2,Food sticks,"Not non-stick. Food still stuck to the rings. Ended up tossing these, wasn't worth sending back for a refund."
1,"Terrible, egg does stick and leaks out the sides in skillet!","The eggs seep out around the bottom even if you let the skillet heat up on medium. They do work better if you do not connect them, but say put three in a skillet separately. I also did not realize just how big a skillet you need to put all four connected into a skillet. I would also oil them very well before adding the egg as well. Over all too much trouble to even send back, but would not reccomend. I got took."
2,Not what I expected at all!,"This product was one I was pretty excited about receiving. However, when it showed up, I was expecting one solid piece. It comes as 4 separate rings that connect by a piece in the middle and the handle connects to the piece in the middle. The handle is plastic and did not connect tightly to the piece in the middle. Very flimsy. My original wanting this product was for poaching eggs. I've since decided, I would've been better of taking 4 tuna cans and taking both sides off and would of had the same thing, just not as flimsy."
2,not great.,"1st of all, there was no handle in the box when it arrived. So I used them individually and realized that they were pretty useless. Making pancakes without the rings works better. I returned this item."
2,a little disappointed.,"The material is a little cheap, and the eggs leaked out from underneath the circles. :( Luckily enough stayed in the circles for them to do their jobs, but it makes too much of a mess so we usually don't even use them. I wouldn't buy them again, especially when I have seen cuter heart shaped ones for a cheaper price at Bed Bath and Beyond. It made me a little sad that this Christmas present was faulty. :/"
1,"Nonstick Egg/Pancake Rings, Set of 4 - HORRIBLE","HORRIBLE PRODUCT, VERY SMALL, VERY DECEIVING, NOT WORTH THE MONEY, DO NOT BUY"
2,Great Idea Not Executed Well,"No fault of the seller but this product is designed for 100% flat surface other wise eggs or pancake mix leaks through. I haven't come across a pan, not even the skillets that you can cook 6 pancakes on that this product sat flush with."
3,Works but could be better,"These work, but they are a little flimsy, and don't stay together well. They want to come apart when lift the handle."
3,Not good for a skillet.,"Be sure you have a nice flat surface. If not, eggs partially run out the bottom of the rings. The rings are pretty lights. They need more weight. Overall it is okay."
1,Melted-mayhem,"Great idea - poor implementation. Overall this unit was very flimsy, but I guess this also helps in taking it apart for cleaning. The plastic handle which holds all the rings together melted during my first attempt to make eggs. Ruined my frying pan, the eggs and my day. Other than that - the rings are tiny, would not use them to make pancakes. Returned it and got my money back."
1,"If you care about your health, don't buy it","I got a set, the coating start to peel off after 6 months. I didn't read the instruction (if any), so I might over heated it, if that's even possible."
1,don't do it...,"I cook a lot and have entertained picking up an egg ring set just for the factor of serving up a neat, easy to eat egg for breakfast sandwhiches. Altough the non-stick 4-piece egg/pancake ring set was inexpensive and was delivered quickly, it's not heavy enough to retain the eggs within the rings when poured in and so the eggs just flowed across the pan like there were nothing there. I suppose that I could place something heavy on them but, do I really want to have to sit a something like another pan on top of them? Not to mention that by the time the pan could be put in place, the disaster would have already occured. I haven't tried them with a thicker pancake batter yet but, as far as I'm concerned, they're getting tossed."
1,Junk,I used these for about a month and ended up never pulling them out of the drawer again. Stickyest non-stick item I have ever used. Even when sprayed with Pam the eggs stick. If the eggs are well scrambled they leak out from under the ring. The one thing correct in the description is that they are easy to take apart. So easy that if you try to use the handle to pick up all four at once it falls apart and drops them all.
2,Yuck.,"I'm pretty easy to please, but these little rings just didn't do it for me. The first time we tried them with pancakes, the batter ran out from underneath. Same with eggs. Maybe we're doing something wrong. They're also kind of a mess to store -- clutter. It's not actually a neat little one piece item like the pictures shows, but 4 separate rings that snap into each other and the little holder. I've only used it a few times and realized that now it just sits in the drawer because it's just too difficult to deal with. So.... another one for the salvage store!"
2,Buy this only if you want...,to make fluffy pancakes or something that has height. Don't get it for making thin pancakes like Swedish pancakes. It is non stick and works well with a sprayed pan. I used it on my griddle and sometimes it leaks ( if using too watery mixture).
1,Waste of money,"I've used these three times and have given up. The eggs leak and spread out around the rings, and then you have a real mess on your hands with these rings embedded in your eggs, and the eggs sticking on both the inside and the outside of the rings.Non-stick!!! The joke is on you if you buy them."
4,Good but not non-stick,"I've used these once a week every week for over three years. Never had to buy new ones, never had the coating chip, never warped, never broke...my only complaint is that they're not non-stick. I have to coat them heavily (using a basting brush) with oil so that the eggs release from the rings when lifted off the pan. Also, I have to super-heat the rings on the pan (covering the pan with a lid) for a few minutes so the eggs don't leak out of the rings (they cook and seal the gap upon contact that way). Once the rings are heated, I oil them, and then the eggs go in nicely without leaking and the rings lift neatly off when the eggs are ready to be flipped. Not sure how they are with pancakes, I have my own method of making pancakes and never needed to use rings."
3,good for the price,"If I could give a rating of 3.5 stars, I would. The rings themselves do exactly what is expected. They are sturdy and easy to clean. I don't have a great cooking background, so I struggled with them the first few uses. If you grease the inside walls with butter or cooking spray before use, it helps a lot.The reason why I don't give the product a 4 or 5 star review is that the handle and center piece are cheap, flimsy, and very nearly useless. I haven't used either since the second or third use of the rings. They just get in the way more than they help."
2,Not a solid product,This product has a very flimsy ring connectors that almost make it not worth using. When you first put it together you can't believe how poorly constructed it really is. I would have sent it back but it was only $9 and not worth my time or effort.
2,not practical for home use.,"Just a bit of a warning. Everything and i do mean everything in this book requires two cups of oil to fry the meat, poultry or what ever your cooking. It's definantly not an option for a healthy eater. Not to mention that using two cups of oil everytime you fix something could be a little expensive. I also purchased ""Breath of a Wok"" at the same time as this book and i highly recommend it instead."
5,Wonderful!!!,"The recipes in this book have the most fabulous flavor!! Mr. Chang Berman explains how to cook them extremely well, explains the what the ingredients are, how to prepare the more uncommon ones and recommends the best brands. The illustrations in the book are wonderful and the stories he relates are definitely great. I rarely, if ever, read a ""cookbook's"" anecdotes, but this one is definitely worth doing. I wish I could write this review as well as Mr. Chang Berman writes his book. If you really enjoy cooking and love Chinese, get this book!!!! By the way, the Brown Sauce (both versions) - to die for!!! Thank you, sir!"
5,Fabulous and Delicious Cooking,"I LOVE THIS BOOK... not only are the recipes marvelous, the stories Berman adds to particular recipes make the reader feel like they truly are cooking authentic chinese food. The recipes are simple and easy and loads of fun to cook!!"
2,Save your money if you use cable connection,"This TV is great if you use S-video, or the USB digital connections, but the external antenna connection using analog is terrible; fuzzy, white-snow, and annoying vertical line anomolies.The first unit I got the external antenna connection was defective. The second unit showed the vertical line anomolies.Great if you use digital, but if you plan on using analog cable connection -- find another unit."
1,Not happy at all,I found this item to be defective when hooked up to either a cable box or a direct cable connection. After 7 different people (including one techy) tried to make this thing work we finally got one channel. Nothing should be this hard. I must have received a lemon.
2,"A very cute idea, but the execution is tricky","My boyfriend - an accomplished cook - tried to make pancakes with this mold and found it very difficult. The thickness of the batter had to be played with and it was difficult to cook the center of the pancakes because the batter was forced up instead of spreading out. They were cute, thick little pancakes that were raw in the center."
3,Cute but a little hard to use,"* It is not easy to pour the batter into the mold. I made oat meal pancakes (thicker batter) so I had to use tea spoon. If the batter is runny enough, I think it will be much easier if you use a sauce bottle to pour it into the mold. And remember don't fill it all the way full.* I only bought one so it took me a while to make a batch.* Beware of the handle, it gets hot too.* It makes quite big size of pancake. The flower sharp is really cute, my kids love it."
4,the best album of their career,"""wolf songs"" is by far the catchiest, most 'complete' sounding thing jf*e has released. unlike the lethargic music and coarse lyrics of their early stuff this album takes up where ""tremble under boomlights"" left off, stepping everything up twofold. instantly catchy yet after a while it loses some of its glamor."
5,Didn't know what to expect,"Not quite ready to write off some of the other sauces I like to use but this stuff was really good in the clam chowder I made the other day. Tried it on pizza too. It's an interesting sauce. Not too much heat, sweet flavor but not too much of each. Oh, it's really good on scrambled eggs."
2,Good Effort.....,"I have seen Jason Vieaux perform live and he played some amazing south american and classical repertoire, but when he played metheny in a baroque suite, I walked out and realized the difference between a recitalist and a creative musician. Jason Vieaux is one of the best recitalists in the world, more than that, he is one of the best teachers and concert-guitarists in the world. But he fails to capture the true -free-spirited-essence of metheny's songs and does not convey the magic or emotion. What we are left with is not the magical music of metheny, but music that is sterile, trite, and contrived for the enjoyment of guitarists who are impressed more with the artistry of technique than the higher art of expression. Essentially, this is metheny without the color and vibrance (and rhythm!!)Please respect my dissention and honesty, thanks."
5,Great work by Vieux,"This was a great work by Jason Vieux. I look forward to future offerings, especially reworkings of Metheny."
1,Warranty is as useless as the scale.,"Don't buy Salter scales. I bought one. It lasted about 2 months before it became completely inaccurate. It was totally unable to settle on a weight. After a few weeks, even with new batteries, it quit working. Salter has ignored all requests to replace the unit despite being under warranty."
1,Stupid!,I have been trying to 2 hours to get this mailbox together. The top wrap will not slide onto the base...what a waste...hate hate hate
1,Dont buy this,"Liked another reviewer exactly the same problem. You need four hands to put this together and if you dont line it up right first time and 'bend' the tab slots you are hosed. Also no post included, only as post cover. Returned it - Don't be fooled. No way is this worth the money or the hastle."
4,solar group mailbox cl10000m,"Easy to put together,very difficult to disassemble. I just cut existing 4x4 slipped new mailbox over it,plum post and drive4 screws and your ready for a delievery.Looks good also."
2,fair game,"The game was ok, and kind of fun to play but i expected better graphics on it in some places you crash your plane without even knowing there was anything there such as a bluff . For the price its not bad and like i said it is fun to play, worth the price for it."
2,Monotonous repetitive droning,The graphics are grainy and unsmooth. The play-action is shakey with a poor imitation of inertia when aiming (moving) the gun. Poor crash and burn on the planes.
2,not close to be a flight sim,"I GOT COMBAT FLIGHT SIMULATER AND THAT GAME ROCK MY BEST FLIGHT SIM EVER. THE GRAPHICS ON THIS GAME ISNT AS GOOD AS IN CFS(COMBAT FLIGHT SIMULATER) AIRPLANE ON CFS ARE BETTER AND LOOK REAL, PLAY CFS WHEN U GOT UP HIGH IN THE AIR LOOK DOWN COOL HUH, I WOULD RECOMEND CFS THEN PHZH."
1,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, THIS GAME IS TERRIBLE","THIS GAME IS THE WORST. I love flight simulator,especially war sims, but this game was by far the worst I have ever played. It is so simple and easy, I beat it all in one day. The graphics and camera views are terrible. (For the camera, there is no cockpit, chase, near, etc. views, you just have an overhead view that you can zoom in and out!!) It is too easy to play. There are only 4 buttons plus the arrow keys to play with. I urge you not to buy this game. It is so bad, you will wish you never spent your money. Might as well buy microsoft flight sim, an ok sim for your money. there are only 10 levels in this pearl harbor game and they are all unlocked when you get the game right out of the box. there is no point to it!!!!! Do not listen to anybody else, this game is terrible"
1,Pearl Harbor,"No joystick provisions, There has not been a game to achieve the play-ability of the original Red Baron (dos) or dos based ww 11 games and they will not run on my computer with windows 98."
4,Good but not well known,"This is a good and fun game with easy to get used to controls. This game includes the game, the ""Pearl Harbor"" cd novel,and a demo of the game ""Real Wars"" (a fun real time strategy game). In this 10 level 3D game, you can WATCH the attack on Pearl Harbor (if you have the code you can play it) and play starting with the aftermath of Pearl Harbor through the bombing of Japan, with planes including the Tiger, the Mustang, and the B-17."
4,Wonderful Performance,"I thought the performance of ""The Seven Last Words of Christ"" was wonderful. I personally prefer the translation from the old Theodore Presser edition better the the G. Schirmer. The quaility of the soloists and the choir was exceptional. The recording level volume causes you to turn your stereo up and down at times but I found that to be only a minor distraction. It provided my choir with a great sampling of the excitement this wonderful old work can bring. I recommend this recording highly.Keith T. RodenDirector of Sanctuary MusicCamp Hill United Methodist ChurchCamp Hill, PA"
4,Another listeners' thoughts,"Both outstanding and disappointing at the same time. Organ is fantastic, as are choir and two male soloists. Soprano has lovely clean tone, but if your hearing in the upper register is failing, you will have a very difficult time understanding her words. (Male soloists are very understandable). The fourth word has great tone, but feels like the director was pressed for time on the overall CD and decided to make up all the gap in this number. Some may prefer the tempo, but for this listener, who has also sung the number many times, the 'hurry up' takes all the anquish and passion out of this most intimate of discourses from the Savior to His Father and reduces it simply as a song to be sung. I'd still buy it for overall quality."
5,The best portable TV available,"This product is simply the best portable product currently available. Has a 3 inch screen yet is easily handheld. I use rechargable NiMH (purchased from Amazon)with good battery life (I have two sets). If price is not a overriding concern, this is the product to buy."
3,"Okay, but a bit of a disappointment","I really enjoyed the first in the ""My Favorite Broadway"" series and I love love songs, so I was eager to get this disc. I was disappointed, however. Many of the selections just don't seem to fit (""Lullaby of Broadway"", ""Gigi"")which makes one wonder about some glaring omissions (Classic Broadway love songs with nothing from ""West Side Story""?). Many of the male arrangements are not so great (Barry Manilow, Robert Goulet), but the female arrangements are, for the most part, quite good, especially Heather Headley, Marin Mazzie, and Chita Rivera with ""How Lucky Can You Get?"". It just seems that it could have been much better."
3,Just shy of good,"After locating completely by accident and listening to the first in this series; My Favorite Broadway; The Leading Ladies, I was quite anxious to see and hear this second entry. My joy in seeing the first was not duplicated in this second venture. Although once again visually beautiful, the selection of music and performers were not at the same level as The Leading Ladies. Where the first kept you entranced from beginning to end, there were long stretches of very boring performances included here. Some of the artists were just not up to the effort. I'll admit to a lump-in-the-throat/tear-in-the-eye reaction to Julie Andrews brief vocalization at the end, and for that it was worth the price."
3,Heather Headley makes it worth it,"Don't get me wrong, the cd is fine and all. But if you need one reason to buy it, it is Heather Headley's version of ""He Touched Me"" from Drat the Cat. It is probably one of the most moving songs you will ever hear on a broadway cd, and i would listen to that woman sing the Wall Street Journal."
3,"Good, but not great","I was really looking forward to this after Broadway Leading Ladies which I thought was amazing, but this wasn't nearly as wonderful. It wasn't that the men were bad, but it didn't have the show stopping numbers we saw in Leading Ladies. It was kind of dull and bland through most of it, lacking pizazz, Mazzie, Headly, Eder , Luker and Pascal are really good on the CD though:)"
1,Not near the quality of Leading Ladies,"We watch the Leading Ladies DVD with guests frequently at home, but feel asleep during the first viewing of Love Songs. Very disappointing."
5,One incredible book,"What sets this book apart from all others is that here is a true story of a man who witnessed the holocaust and fought with the underground. In vivid clarity, the author tells his story giving you not only the facts but the thoughts, the emotions and the graphic details that make this a book that cannot be read in spurts - it must be read in one sitting. And it is a story that you'll never, ever forget."
3,More charming than thrilling,"The Thrills have a folk rock sound with a retro 70's approach which they seem to capture in their cover for 'So Much For The City'. It's like these guys sat around listening to alot of AM California rock from the late 70's, eg, The Eagles and Fleetwood Mac. Breezy sounds with the occasional organ, mandolin/banjo, piano, and harmonica. Just think the lazy melodies of Belle and Sebastian, the acoustic/folk tendencies of Badly Drawn Boy, meets the last 2 CD's of The Delgados."
2,muddled and long winded,"I'm really interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence, but the author's outright assumption that he is going to do for thought what Schrödinger's did for DNA (before its discover) is pretty arrogant. I don't know what it is (perhaps using mind as a proper noun inconsistently), but halfway through the book I couldn't take it anymore and ditched it in favor for Hawkins' ""On Intelligence"". Life is too short."
3,Competent performances,"Like other productions by Lawrence Welk and Myron Floren, this one is professionally performed, but it really doesn't generate a lot of excitement. It could use a little more variation in tempo from track to track. There are no lyrics anywhere, even though most of these songs come with them. This is the first time, for example, that I have heard Just Because without the words. This CD just doesn't have the pizazz of a Frankie Yankovic or a Joey Miskulin or an Eddie Blazonczyk. It's several cuts above elevator music, however."
5,Happy Stuff!,"Wonderful music that I am able to listen to every day that makes it brighter, thanks to this great CD!"
4,FUN ALBUM FOR JAZZ LOVERS,"Not sure why this album has attracted so many negative reviews. For people who are into classical jazz, or into having some creative fun with popular numbers (e.g., Alanis Morisette taking ""Let's Do It, Let's Fall In Love"" for a spin), this is a fairly enjoyable compilation.From Natalie Cole's heart wrenching ""Every time we say goodbye"", to the nasal cover opener by Robbie Williams ""It's De-Lovely"", to a smattering of out-of-tune but cheeky renditions from, er, Kevin Kline (!) -- the album is a very good buy for what it is worth.Of course the songs will mean more if you actually see the movie itself, which may make even pseudo-plaintive croonings of Ashley Judd in ""In the Still of the Night"" come alive with sentiment. I recommend it to be quite an enjoyable album if you know that you're stepping into unusual singers having fun with jazz, perfectly reflecting the intent of the movie it was set together for."
5,Robbie Williams,Sorry for my bad english. I want to say that it is crazy that in the usa nobobdy knows Robbie Williams. In europe he is THE most succesfull singer in popmusic. Every album is number 1 almost in every country in europe. Please listen to the music of this guy. many songs are very amazing. check it out :)thanks and greetings from germany
2,A mismatch,Cole Porter's work is great. The performers leave much to be desired. The old standard versions should have been utilized.Some of the newcomers' voices are weak or uninteresting for the material. The Sheryl Crow rendition of Begin the Beguine is abysmal at best.
2,Revolting...,"Being a Cole Porter admirer since my teens I was looking forward to receive this CD. I must say that it has been a HUGE dissapointment. The likes of Sheryl Crow and Alanis Morissette should be kept away of really beautiful songs. After destroying Begin The Beguine, that woman appropriately named Crow should be sent to a gulag for failed artists."
1,Rotted!,"How sad that Cole Porter's life has the distinction of having 2 terrible movies made about it. The performances on this album are just God-awful. Really, this rates NO stars. Buy yourself a great compilation of Mr. Porter's work instead..."
1,"Run, don't walk away from this one!","If you love the music of Cole Porter, you'll be aghast at the ""stunt casting"" used to assemble performers for this soundtrack. If you are unfamiliar with the Porter songbook, for God's sake start with Lee Wiley or Ella Fitzgerald's interpretations, not here!Performances range from merely okay (Natalie Cole) to outright disastrous (Elvis Costello). A version of ""Begin The Beguine"" transposed into an inappropriate key by Sheryl Crow does not ""transform"" the song so much as ""disfigure"" it.Far from making these already immortal songs ""accessible"" for a ""new generation,"" this soundtrack trashes some of the greatest popular songs ever composed. What a shameful wasted opportunity, when there is in fact a ""new generation"" of jazz- and cabaret-inspired singers who could have done a much, much better job."
4,Virtuosity Americana,I liked this CD. Variety of great American singers presenting some Classical American Cole Porter songs. I like the movie and I love the CD.
3,"sample cd of ""De Lovely""..Cole Porter music","I enjoyed the cd, but ads on internet did not make it clear that it was a short, ""sample"" of the music..cd price was cheap, but with shipping it would have been better to buy a full cd...my mistake but please clarify in the future..Amazon!"
1,Soundtrack to a train wreck,"The movie ""De-Lovely"" is a train wreck, and this is an appropriate soundtrack, complete with the grinding metal and cracking glass of the ""voices"" involved. Alanis Morissette takes bottom honors for her evisceration of ""Let's Do It,"" which makes nails on a chalkboard sound melodic. Sheryl Crow dissects ""Begin the Beguine,"" which is put in a MINOR key, thus destroying the chord progressions throughout. She's seldom sounded as gratingly nasal. Elvis Costello's ""Let's Misbehave"" is a travesty; Diana ""Mrs. Costello"" Krall's ""Just One of Those Things"" is a very bad thing indeed; and the other performances are uniformly dreadful, except for Vivian Green's Billie Holiday-ish ""Love For Sale"" and Natalie Cole's inoffensive ""Every Time We Say Goodbye."" That a new generation should be exposed to Cole Porter's music with this collection of ""hip"" barrel-scrapings is a musical crime. Vomitous."
2,De-Lovely? Hardly!,"This cd is being sold on TV. When I heard some of the performances, I was appalled. Poor Cole Porter, to be represented in this way. People, get out to the music stores and get his music as done by really proficient Porter interpreters. For example, there is a better performance on LET'S MISBEHAVE in the (excellent) comedy film, JOHNNY DANGEROUSLY (musicians unknown to me). I wish that Tony Bennett would make an all-Porter album. Then, you'd be hearing something worthwhile! I'll give it 2 stars, for Diana Krall & Natalie Cole."
1,Everything Goes... down hill,"Fortune cries to this awful CD: Nay, Nay to You. What an awful bunch of singers De-vastating my precious Cole Porter classics, led by, of all people, Sheryl Crow and the usually talented Diana Krall. The cool, pleasing voice of Natalie Cole was, praise the Lord, the only exception although it was not enough to save the day.As a longtime Cole Porter fan, I find the soundtrack (the film was as bad, besides being awfully silly and ""p.c."" compliant)the worst among all CDs showcasing Cole Porter's songs. You're better off buying the old, reliable Cole Porter CD song books by Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald. They sing, revel in, and capture the purity and gaiety of his timeless songs. There's no need to embellish Cole Porter's music for his songs are classics. To do so is like gilding the lily."
2,Not very De-Lovely,"I was profoundly disappointed in this CD. The songs are wonderful, of course, but the vocal quality of the various performers is dismal. There really should be a disclaimer stating that while they may be wonderful actors, their singing ability is just about like any other guy on the street. I would recommend Peter Skellern's ""Cheek to Cheek"" or ""Stardust Memories"" instead."
1,Not for a true Cole Porter lover,"I saw the film and was concerned that the CD would have the same arrangements and artists as the film, because the music in the film was less than great. The story was fascinating. After hearing the samples and reading a review I decided not to waste the money."
3,Awful Movie Great Soundtrack,"Luckily, I went to see this movie premiere for free with a little help from my friends. The movie was two hours of stilted dialogue, melodramatic acting, and loosely configured plots. The only thing that vaguely saved the movie is the soundtrack. I have problems with the Robbie Williams' version of ""De-Lovely,"" his flat nasal voice just doesn't do it for me. On the other hand, ""Love For Sale"" gave me chills during the movie and ""In the Still of the Night"" could be rapidly becoming one of my favourite songs. In conclusion, the soundtrack far surpasses the movie, and buying it would suffice as experience."
3,"Fair Intro, but Listen to the REAL THING!","Most of these recordings of classic Porter tunes are OK, and decent enough in that they attempt to educate the younger generation to some fantastic tunes written mainly during the Great Depression. Since the best Porter tunes have been recorded hundreds, if not thousands of times, I suggest taking some time to check the really best of these classic songs. Any one of these songs recorded in the 1950's by classic song stylists like Old Blue Eyes, Ella Fitzgerald, and some slightly lesser singers of the era give these songs the renderings that they deserve! So , don't miss the Frank and Ella renditions! In fact, they are among the finest popular song recordings ever made!"
2,"Movie: 5, Soundtrack: 2","Great movie... BUT... hearing ONLY the soundtrack it is a 2... why? Because the music is some of the most melodic and beautiful ever written and several performances are neither authentic of the time, or not sung in a way the beauty of the song can be heard. This music is NOT about the performer... it was about the song! Most of the original recordings which featured a singer did not even have the singers name on the record! That is because the song was beautiful and did NOT need a song ""stylist"" to make it ""all about the singer""!Having said that, most of the songs in the film are not bad... and standouts include Natalie Cole and Diana Krall. The sad renditions are worst with Sheryl Crow TRYING to sing ""Begin the Beguine"" and Elvis Costello who butchers ""Let's misbehave.""Get these tunes on CD from some great people who sang them in the past... like Sinatra, Torme, Clooney, Bennett and Vaughn."
2,Cole Porter like you never heard before.,"Interesting is the best word for this album. Kevin Kline's singing is entertaining - he's a better singer than Cole Porter. At first I did not like the album, but it grew on me. Most of the songs are entertaining when taken in context with the movie and the fact these songs were written for broadway and not the recording studio. I prefer my Porter by Sinatra, Bennett, Nat King Cole, etc., but most of these artists give adequate, if not familiar treatment to his music. The worst, by far, is Sheryl Crowe's version of Begin the Beguine. She thoroughly ruins one of the greatest songs ever written. All in all, even with his tinny voice, Cole Porter's own version of You're the Top is the best song on the album. It's definitely a soundtrack - not a definitive collection of Cole Porter music."
4,PERFECT SERVICE AND A MEMORABLE COLE PORTER CD,I am very pleaed -- not only with this marvelous Cole Porter sound track but with the excellent service I received through Amazon's provider. It was smooth from the start and the cd arrived so very quickly.
3,De-Lovely,The songs of Cole Porter in quite modern arrangement. Much closer to modern tastethan originals.
2,Porter Deserves Better Singers for the most part,"I was excited about this soundtrack. After giving it a listen though, the champagne fizzled and fell flat. Most importantly in a Porter song is the delivery of his wonderful lyrics and notes. Unfortunately, the pacing and orchestrations are off or not up to the high standards that MGM, Paramount and other studios were able to excel so wonderfully at in the 1950's. There are a few exceptions to the rule and three singers capture the spirit of Cole. Those being first Vivian Green, Natalie Cole and Elvis Costello. If you really want to enjoy Porter delivered in the high fashion he deserves buy the soundtrack to these films, Kiss Me Kate(1953), Anything Goes (1956) High Society (1956) Can Can (1960) or even Born To Dance (1936). Cole Porter does save the day on the last track of the De-Lovely soundtrack by singing and playing with all his magical flair with the song ""You're The Top."""
4,Excellent,Great pop/jazz standards here by modern singers. Can't go wrong here if you like this genre of music.
5,Lovely Music,After hearing this soundtrack I ordered it immediately and have been enjoying it ever since. Most of the songs are soothing and lower my blood pressure.
5,De-Lovely CD soundtrack Cole Porter songs,"Timeless music brought up to date with current artists such as Alanis Morisette, Natalie Cole, Sheryl Crowe, Robbie Williams, Elvis Costello as well as the stars of the film Kevin Kline and Ashley Judd.Fabulous music!"
5,Wrangler Logger Shirt,"Wrangler Logger Shirt is rugged and well put together. Many types of clothing is advertised as ""Logger Wear"" but are just regular work shirts, as a Wildland Fire Fighter for nearly 20 years, I can tell you that this shirt will hold up to the demand of the job."
4,good heavy shirt well made,"this is a good heavy work shirt, great for welding in, unfortunately not made in the usa, would give it 5 stars if it was"
5,"If you need heavy duty, rugged work shirt...well, here it is!",As a machinist I sometimes need a longsleeved shirt. Shopped on Amazon.com and narrowed the Riggs down by user reviews. This shirt is heavy duty and I don't see it wearing out any time soon. I will be buying one or two more. Size is on the big which is good if you move around a lot on the job.
5,A quality rugged shirt,"I had a burgundy colored version of this shirt already and wear it a lot in the winter, so decided to order another in Forest Green. These are very well made shirts, they hold their color well and are quite sturdy to work in. A decent price for a quality product that will last."
4,Nice shirt,It's nice shirt. I like. A lot. Might buy more. I try different color next time. Till then I''ll wear this one.
4,Good Shocks,"I put these on my 1995 gmc jimmy slt with a torsion bar suspension. After cranking the torsion bars up an inch and installing these my car performs great and looks more aggressive. Overall it added 1.5 inches. I havent had them on very long, but so far I like them."
3,Jerry Springer Dr. Talk,"This is Jerry Springer's attempt at making it in the recording industry.This album is not as bad as I thought, but wasn't surprised to find out that he didn't win an award for Dr. Talk.I rank this album up there with other musical works produced by celebrities not known for their musical talent: Shaquille O'Neal (made a rap album), David Hasselhof (a hit in Europe), Eddie Murphy (party all the time), and Don Johnson (Looking for a Heartbreak).The 1st song is sometimes played on Jerry's show whenever Hillbilly guests show up. The rest of the songs remind me of a person attempting to sound professional at Karaoke night in the local pub."
3,Hoping for more info on making vinegar at home,"Although this is a very thorough book on the subject of vinegar it focuses primarily on industrial production and very, very little on making it yourself at home. I was hoping it would be more along the lines of a book explaining how to brew beer, which is a hobby I enjoy."
2,save you money,This book offers almost no information beyond what you get from a good google search. The whole chapter on balsamic vinegar is just plain wrong. And its not even printed up to modern standards. The author doesn't appear to know better; the publisher should be ashamed.
1,"""User-Friendly"" my a**....","As others have mentioned this is NOT for the beginner. It is in fact for those who wish to become very frustrated and angry at the feeling of having just been misled, and thereby ripped-off, by a rather misleading title. This will NOT teach you everything you need to know for home production. It will however inform you of the colossal machinery needed to produce such a product at a rate of several thousands of gallons a day."
3,"Tons of info, can be overwhelming","This is a good reference book to have, but it is certainly geared to the large scale vinegar production, not the small vinegar maker. It has so much information in it that I don't really need to know, but the author certainly is knowledgeable. Although the reading of it is much more information that I want to know about how to make vinegar, it is a good book to have for reference."
3,Heavy duty - emphasis on the heavy.,"This is a very sturdy cane. It's got a good grip, although it twists easily against the metal, which makes me nervous. I like the adjustable height since I'm also taller than average in addition to being heavy. I like the tip on it; it has a lot of surface area and I feel more secure than I have with other canes. Here's the ""but"" - if you've got any kind of lifting restriction, you don't want this cane. It's heavy. I told my friend something this heavy should come with a motor. The shipping says it's less than four pounds. Maybe so. I know if anyone comes after me I can wallop them with this - if I can lift it up high enough. :)"
5,Medline Heavy Duty Cane,"This is a cane on steroids. It's heavy & could be used as a weapon. The handle is a hard, not like a regular cane. It has a double pin instead of one positioning the height. The swing using it normally will build up muscles in the arm you use. Medline has made a really good cane. If your older or frail make sure you can handle the weight. It supports a person up to 500lbs. I'm 6'4"" & 335lbs. I have no problems with it."
5,Great Product,This is a great cane for those over the weight limit for other canes. It is very sturdy and provides the added support needed.
5,Best cane ever!!!,I love this cane!! I am a big buy and this cane can take it!! I like the large tip and the feel in general. Awesome product at an awesome price!!!
4,Sturdy,"I'm 6'3"" and 210 Lbs and this cane feels heavy duty and secure. It is definitely a little heavier than most canes of this type but unless your arms or shoulders are unusually weak, this will serve you well. The double button latch also adds to the stability."
5,Solid and sturdy walking aide.,"I ordered this cane shortly after I had a knee surgery. I should have ordered it earlier. It has been very helpful in my recovery.The cane itself is very sturdy and solid. I am a large guy, about 300 lbs, so I needed something a little stronger than normal. It is a little bit weighty itself, but that was easy to get used to. I recommend this to anyone who needs a cane and has strong wrists."
3,heavy cane for older people to use,cane is nice but heavy to hold for older people as i am 8o yrs I gave it to my son who needs it now after operation
5,It works.,"Simple adjustments may be needed based on your height. It will work as advertised, expecially if you're over 200, 300 or ever 400 pounds. The product I received was as advertised and was not complicated to set up, nor use. Now, I only need to learn how to use a cane, properly. :)"
2,Too heavy to use...,"Although this appears to be a very well made cane and would make someone feel very secure, if you have back problems, this cane may not be for you. It was very heavy and therefore more uncomfortable to use than a normal weight cane."
4,Kinda bulky,"This cane is a decent quality and one of the few affordable ones for patients over 250 lbs. The patient needing this had a knee replacement, and found the cane rather cumbersome, heavy and bulky. But it serves the purpose and is very sturdy."
5,"awesome ""Heavy Duty"" as described",These are the best canes if you are a heavy purson who uses his or her cans to support yourself. You won't have to worry about these bending or giving out on you. they are a little on the heavy (weight wise) but not too heavy to handle and you dont even notice the weight after a few days. I highly reccomend these to everyone who wants to feel confident they will be supported by their canes. I have used a set of these for the past two years and just reordered because the original ones got chipped up from use. and the rubber feet ended up rounding off.
5,One of George Michael's last good singles!,I think that this single was one of George Michael's best/last good singles before he started drifting off of the deep end...I think everyone knows what I mean by that! I think that this is a classic. This CD single also has multiple versions/remixes of the song that are good also. I would recommend this CD single to all George Michael fans (who don't already own it).
5,This is really beautiful,"What a haunting CD. I was drawn into it and was happy to stay there! When you really listen to the deep lyrics you are moved. I haven't been ""lost"" in a CD in a long time. Beautiful voice. Ophelia and Die to This World are my favorites. But I can honestly say that I liked every cut on this CD. I would really like to see her perform in concert."
5,magical,every once and awhile you find one... one that gets inside of you and knocks you around... one that changes your head and heart... one that reaches you deep beneath the surface... this is one! alisa carroll is a true poet...
5,Listen to This One,Listened to clips of this CD on the artist's site and had to have it. Where is she/who is she touring with? I'll be back to her web site to find out. My personal favorite is Ophelia--the songs are beautiful and I'll look forward to another CD for more from this gifted singer. I'm hooked.
2,*wince*,"When I sat down to read ""Thursday's Child"" I was prepared for B level romance. I was a little surprised to be disappointed. The book was a lot closer to a low C grade. There was little to no character development, scummy heros (a dangerous move that can only be pulled off by very good writers), and most frustrating of all no research into the supposed plot line. As a woman scientist I dont expect everyone to be familiar with the field, however something as blatant as the ethical issues of human testing I did expect to be common knowledge, if only from the movies. ""Thursday's Child"" was a major let down, especially since I've read some of her other books and I know she can do better."
3,A fast read,Thursday's Child was a good read if you want a simple romance. I read it in a few hours and thought it was pretty good. It's not like most of the Brown books I read and I would try to find it used if possible.
1,dreadful,"What a horrible book. I was hoping for an unhappy ending because I just hated these people for boring me to death. I got it on audio and I went through the last tape in 5 minutes by fast forwarding through most of it. Unfortunately it was Sunday, the rental store was closed and my other option (on the radio) was sports which I hate. So I gave it 1 star, it was better (but not much) than sports."
5,"SANDRA BROWN, WHAT CAN I SAY???SHALLOW, BUT FUN!!!!","I absolutly love Sandra Browns books!! Okay, I admit this is shallow and silly but ooohhhhhhhh, so romantic!!!! Lets face it,I am a sucker for a corny romance!! Anyway, if you are a die hard Sandra Brown fan you will love this book!"
1,Very Repetitive,I really think Sandra Brown should stick with mystery novels such as Envy. This book was the worst book I have read in a LONG time. I had to make myself finish reading it. Very repetitive and BORING. I would not recommend it to anyone.
2,cute story,"I have twin daughters, which is why I bought this book and wanted to read it.The story was cute during the first half, but had too much kissing and sex and petting in the second half for me.I am not fond of this type of story, but if you are a romance story fan, then this book is for you.At times, a bit far fetched but a real intersting storyline."
3,Thursday's Child,"I love Sandra Brown and I liked this book. I did not like the way Spencer's occupation was kept so secret, only to find out what it really was. That was a let down. But, all in all, it was typical Sandra Brown."
1,This book is merely foreplay,"I'd never read Sandra Brown before, but a friend recommended this book when she saw me reading a book by Cassandra King, telling me that if I liked King I'd also like Brown. There is no way the two are similar. To be fair, I've never read anything else by Brown, but after reading this book I certainly don't intend to. The book consisted almost entirely of descriptions of kissing, foreplay and finally the sexual act itself. The 'plot' was very meager and I didn't even finish reading the book; I merely skipped to the end, and, as expected ""the boy got the girl."" There was no character development and the storyline was pretty unbelievable. I don't understand how Brown can consider herself a serious author when she writes this kind of trash. I suppose there are those out there who like to vicariously live out their sex life through books; I am not one of those people. I do like a good romance now and again, this doesn't qualify."
3,Twins Having Fun,"To take care of an important business a twin sister asks her sibling to pretend to be her person with her fiancé for a few days. Nothing is supposed to happen but one chaos after another pursues especially with the emergence of a rather attractive friend of the fiancé. The acting sister takes care of situations her own way including the overly confident friend. The story is blasé and the characters are predictable. Romance writers seem to be very highly imaginative with emotions, characteristics, temptations, and big-headedness and Ms. Brown is included among them. Strong traits especially of the heroine are taken to the extreme but it is fortunate that the time spent to finish the whole story is minimal."
1,Bathroom Material,"I have to agree with the reviewers, this novel by Sandra Brown was extremely boring. Like others, I found myself passing pages to get to the end. Even put it in the bathroom because it only held my interest momentarily. It reminded me a prank that high school twins would play on their boyfriends. It was not highly the style that I am accustomend to when reading Brown's writing so this novel was a complete flop."
1,Dear God... I never knew a book could be so horrible!,"This is my first book from Sandra Brown and well... it makes me not want to read any of her other work. Yeah, I heard she's a real good author and all, but this book just put me off. Ok, so the beginning started out pretty interesting, despite the characters being extremely and almost disbelievably shallow. But when Spencer began persuading ""Ann"" to leave her fiance, geez, i was about ready to throw this book across the room. But that wasn't the lease of it, suddenly, Allision is in love with him? Excuse me? Sorry? I think I completely missed something here. She met him what? 3 days ago? But I continued reading it, God knows why.. and I don't believe I ever had such a strong urge to throw a book across the room. So all and all, I thought this book was dreadful and even horribly written. No plot line, no depth, and the dialogue? Don't even get me started..."
2,Literary Lackluster,"Can she write? Apparently so, but this latest from Ms. Brown seems written by rote. My main objection to it, however, is that the characters are so one-dimensional and unreal. The plot, too, is weak, which could be overlooked if not for the characters. My worst fear is that the world she describes might actually exist. Still, for a light and mindless distraction, this book is perfect and quickly forgettable."
2,Barely tolerable,"I almost bought this book in hardcover - simply because I share the herione's name, and Allison's are usually pretty smart. I'm glad I waited until the paperback - the wallet pain was lessened. As other reviewers have noted, this was a reprint of an earlier work, the plot wasn't credible, and the characters weren't very intelligent (although Allison was made out to the be brainy one). I just couldn't bring myself to give a book with my namesake a '1'."
2,"CD isn't terrible, but it isn't Camarón","...in fact, only two of the songs on the disc are credited to him. It's false advertising.i gave the cd 2 stars b/c of this and not 1 star b/c it isn't horrible.not an extensive review--sorry."
5,Teacher's perspective,"I teach anatomy and physiology subjects at a Health Faculty, and I have been using Physiological Medicine as my guide for the subject of Applied Physiology. I find it extremely useful, well written, with good summaries, questions and cases. The graphic quality could be better, yes, but everything important is there."
3,"Heavy, and appears to be well made.",I did not expect it to say FORD RACING on the back in big red letters... this was a let down because it was for a Ford Escape driver... Otherwise it appears to be a pretty decent keychain.
2,Can't get it to stay stuck.,"Everything seems fine with this device, but I can't get it to suction to my formica counter top. Can anyone give me a hint?"
5,Great,I make my own applesauce. My husband laughs every time I get this out. It makes peeling and coring the apples a breeze. Your apples will end up in rings but that is fine with me as long as I do not have to peel by hand. Fun to use.
2,I didn't want to do this,"But I've had to lower my review of this truely promissing game. I've tried to play this game on four different computers, running three different OS's (98SE, ME, XP) with four different brands of video card (ATI Rage Mobility, ATI Radeon Mobility, GeForce 256, and GeForce 4) with differeing amounts of RAM (128MB-640MB) and it crashed on all of them. What REALLY angers me is that it always crashes when the really cool new transit systems come along (MagLev), thus proving that I wasted two hours getting to that point. Saving before an expected crash and coming back has no effect. I've tried all of the patches and fixes that have come along, all of my drivers are up to date, and yet it still crashes.I really wish this game were more stable, as I have never actually been able to complete it. Cureently, I have no plans to reinstall it anywhere and am in fact thinking of selling it.Sad, really. Traffic Giant looked so promising, but it seems incapable of delivering."
2,Great Game with lots of Problems... Don't buy it!!,"After playing this game several times, I found it to be a lot of fun, but then it started having problems. It randomly freezes or crashes with no explanation. If you check the JoWood website you can see in their support forum that this is a problem that many are having and that is being ignored. This really shows a problem on their part."
1,System Crashes,"There are serious bugs once you get to advanced stages. I have had repeated screen freezes and system crashes. Twice my system has been so seriously corrupted that I have had to re-format my hard drive and re-load everything. The only common denominator in those cases was this game. After the last re-format, I will no longer load or play Traffic Giant. That's too bad because this game had a lot of potential."
2,Trap & Skeet Shooting,DVD is ok for someone who has no idea at all about skeet or trap shooting or shotgun shooting in general. Don't expect this to teach you techniquesor instruction on how to break more clays. It will tell you the definition of skeet and trap shooting but it won't make you a better shooter.
5,"Great Dinosaur! Elasmosaurus, the swimming Dinosaur!",I loved this toy! It looks totally real and my grandson loved playing with it. He is 3 and knows almost all of the dinosaurs by name. This is one he had asked for especially for bath time. He said he needed a swimming dinosaur and low and behold here was the most realistic one I could find. No silly blue or orange or pink in this toy. Very authentic looking and able to take a licking. Very happy with this purchase.
3,Overpriced toy,The plastic dinosaur was enjoyed by my grandson who loves dinosaur but it is highly overpriced. The objext it very small. I would not recommend it. You can buy a whole tub of plastic dinosaurs at Target or ToysRus for less than the cost of this one toy.
5,Quality Stuff,"The Carnegie Collection was always my favorite brand of toy dinosaurs. The level of scientific accuracy is exquisite, especially for children's toys, and they are among the most durable dinosaur models I've ever owned. My Elasmosaurus figure in particular is over 12 years old, and aside from some slight fading of the paint, it looks as good as the day I bought it!"
5,Wonderful toy at a great price,"The craftsmanship is excellent. The detail is impressive. I bought this toy for my five-year old niece, a dinosaur enthusiast, and she loves it. It wears well as it has been in the tub many times. I wish there were more marine reptiles/prehistoric marine predators, like mosasaurus or an ichthyosaur. Buy it with another marine monster, like kronosaurus or deinosuchus, to add to the fun."
3,Ok,"I was looking for this and other specific dinosaurs 'cause my little brother is a big fan of them. I found this item ok. I expected it to have better quality details, but it's ok according to the price. I didn't love it, tho."
2,Terrible paint job!,I've been a happy customer of schleich and Safari until I bought this. The paint job is terrible. Whoever did the paint job just added lots of green spots on the dinosaur. That's all. nothing like the picture. I hope Safari corrects this issue as I love their attention to detail in general.
3,can't beat the price,"For a little bit more than the price of 1 DVD, you get 4. Ok so they are no oscar caliber films, but you do get what you pay for."
2,poor,"4 poor examples from the horror industry, have a allnighter with all 4 film and you'll get a good nights sleep"
5,Very helpful with my infant,"Though I don't do everything exactly as Laurie Boucke teaches in her book, I have found this method of dealing with elimination to be a good experience with my first (and only) child who is currenlty 8 months old. We started IPT a few days after bringing her home from the hospital, and the book is what taught me and gave me the confidence to try it in the first place. My mom and husband were very supportive of trying out this method, so that was really the key to getting it started. This is a great book for anyone who is interested in learning more about IPT, and it isn't overwhelming because it gives you the basics in a straighforward way."
4,Great Product,Only thing to say great product. You catch signal everywhere and easy to handle. Nice picture and good sound. Excellent!!
2,Can't get reception with this.,"I picked one of these up cheap on Ebay. I live in North County San Diego and the only station I can pick up really well on both UHF and VHF is Telemundo--which comes in *great*. Too bad english is my only language.Anyway, I don't know if this is a fault of the TV or the technology--but I can't imagine traveling with this if I can only pick up 1 station so near a major metropolitan area. Can't imagine what might happen in the middle of nowhere."
1,no reception,I got this off ebay cheap dont know if its the tv or what but cant get any stations. Could be that its too old for todays digital signal.
4,"I just finished it, and I liked it!","Earl Murray really is one of the best western writers still putting out new books. I love Louis and Zane, but have finished most of their works. I now consider Earl one of my favorites, and love how well researched his books are. You can almost taste the old west."
3,Does not support Older Model Xplory!,I received the product and it was molded in ABS plastic. Does feel like it's worth $60 I paid. Try to find a used unsed one and save some Moulaaa.
4,"Works well, price too much for a pair of plastic made in China","Works really well with maxi-cosi car seat, price too much for a pair of plastic made in China. Guess this piece isn't mass produced as it could be."
5,Extensive information about an intriguing game species.,"Mettler gives a thorough examination of the wild turkey. He covers information about its origins, habitat, calls, and the equipment and skills necessary for a successful and ethical harvest. The illustrations also give clarity to the greenhorn turkey hunter."
3,Typical middle of the road hunting book,"I have read several turkey hunting books, magazines, and articles. This book does contain some good information, but mainly just touches on the basics. As an experienced hunter, this book didn't really offer me any help I could use in the field. I would only recommend this book for a hunter new to turkey hunting and only wanting brief information."
5,Right On Time God,"This book was very inspirational and these are real life issues. Isaiah and his father was reunited together at God's time. I disagree with the person that had the title Good Idea, Bad Writing, but everyone is entitled to there own opinion. The comment made about how the author kept pointing out that Isaiah and Torri were carbon copies of Asia & Nicholas, well you have to look at it like this. Isaiah was raised by his mom and his mom alone. I was alway told that 9 times out of 10 a male is going to marry a lady that has the same characters either his mother/sister has, especially if they are good. And Isaiah loved his mom. This is a good read for females just as well as males. I commend Ms. Hudson and encourage her to keep up the good work."
5,Duncan and Steven Sauer create magic,"Phantom Moon is definately not top 40 pop music. But it's so profoundly refreshing to find an artist who cares more about his music than his bank account, who creates music that makes you think, that haunts you with its beauty. Phantom Moon is a gift-a rare treasure in a music world dominated by boy bands and teen queens. I hope Duncan Sheik sees fit to grace us with his talent for many years to come."
4,Another beautiful work from Duncan,"The reviews I read about this cd have been decidedly mixed and I'm not quite sure why. The lyrics are some of the most beautiful I have heard in awhile, and the arrangements are textured and lovely. Duncan's voice is perfectly matched to both. Just listen to ""Sad Stephen's Song"" and if you are not overwhelmed by its beauty you have a heart of stone."
3,"A slight slip for Duncan, but still a good album.","As a huge Duncan Sheik fan, I was honestly a little disappointed by Phantom Moon. His debut was an amazing record and Humming was easily one of the best albums to be released in the 1990's. So when it came to Phantom Moon, I was really looking forward to hearing new material. While the CD is good, it doesn't nearly come close to it's predecessor or Humming's predecessor. On Phantom Moon, Duncan hooks up with writer Stephen Sater whom he met at a Buddhist group in New York City and the collaberation created a very acoustic, light sound. I guess what I don't like about the CD is that it's not nearly as lush in sound as Humming was and a little less than his debut. Bottom line with the new record is that if you're a fan, you'll love the album, but pass on it if you're only a passive fan."
2,Duncan can't pull this one off for me!,"I respect Duncan Sheik. His self-titled debut was great and he seems to really care more about his art than his wallet. ""Phantom"" fell short in a number of areas for me. Many of the melodies seem recycled and Sater's lyrics weren't inspiring enough to hold my attention. To me, this a collection of sophis- ticated camp songs -picturesque in presentation but lacking in substance. Some of the stuff reminds me of that dreadful overlong dirge on ""Humming"" called ""Nichiren"". That said,I'm glad I picked this cd up in a used bin."
1,Music written by a person who thinks he is above us all...,"This album is a huge disappointment. The lyrics are inaccessible, and listening to this record is like listening to a little kid trying to ""show off"" how intellectual he/she is. What we dish out is always reciprocated, though. The album never even charted (meaning it has not even sold 5,000 units). Thus, Mr. Sheik will likely be dropped from Atlantic. Even records on subsidiary labels such as NONESUCH are supposed to turn a profit."
5,Wow! So Profoundly Original it is shocking!,"Spent some time listening and really falling in love with Sheik's first release recently-then went out and grabbed this cd. As good as the first cd is, Phantom Moon is one of the most wonderful creative and unique cd's I have heard in years. Sheik can get you into a rythym and change the entire direction of the music so subtly that you don't even notice. What a beautiful creation this is-now I have to run out a grab Humming....PS he also has a great website...."
3,details,"When I took a chance on this product, I had hoped for more details. Since there are none, I'll give you one. I had hoped for more of a diaper-cotton product. This is a cotton-jersey product. It is cotton, but I have lots of rags like this and it doesn't make as nice of a rag as a diaper-type cotton, especially for dusting."
2,Eh... Not worth the five bucks,I should have just gone to walmart and bought rags. I was trying to avoid going to the store and bought these. Not a good choice. Would not buy them again. Just cut up t-shirt type material. I can do that myself.
4,Easy instructions and great ideas,"This book is great, especially to those willing to experiment and try new adventures with color. Color can change the entire look and feel and energy of your home and living spaces and Debbie really brings that out with helping you choose color based on the mood you want for a space.Have fun! Go crazy! and enjoy :)"
3,She Sticks to One Style,"This book is for people who like lots of color, and the shabby chic cottage type of look (painted furniture, painted hardwood floor, etc). I was hoping she would offer paint ideas for a wide array of decorating styles which she does not.Check it out from your local library instead."
1,Unhelpful,"I found no practical ideas in this book. It appears to me the author is trying to see how outrageous she can be. I'm sorry I bought it. If you're a college freshman looking for ideas on decorating your dorm room for halloween, this book might work for you."
4,First-rate decorating journal which is engaging and fun.,"This book is an essential ingredient for anyone who feels an itch to paint anything, anywhere in their home. It is accesable to those less familiar with the lingo and provides a fantastic array of quality photogrpahs to stir the imagination. For the connesieur of paint & design, it offers more solutions than could be acted on in years of painterly play. Travis and Dingle have articulated everything so clearly that you won't need to waste any thinner deciphering text or jargon, either; crystal clear step-by-step processes throughout. Bravo!"
3,Not very informative,"She has pictures of the finished product,but she doesn't show you step by step pictures of the process to get there."
4,Debbie Travis Decorating Solutions : More Than 65,"I love this book! Not as much as Debbie Travis Painted House...that's 5 stars! But I love this book! I disagree with the Halloween review...color is a personal choice...some people are at the other end of the spectrum (can you say ""Martha Stewart""?) This book gives great instructions in easy to understand language. I finally colorwashed my bathroom and 1/2 bath and was confident enough not to even practice first! This book makes it that easy to grasp. I really miss seeing Debbie's show...I can't find it anymore on PBS. Too bad! She's a great teacher."
1,Debbie Travis' decorating solutions,If you have bought Painted House then there is no need to buy this book as there is little difference. Does not live up to it's advertising. Looks better on TV than in real time
2,No hooks for the reader,"This is a dull and dry biography for such a colorful subject. Boring, circular descriptions and few interesting anecdotes. Not recommended."
2,works but painful,these items work but you have to push hard on the skin. and when you are doing a continuous line it drags and causes red marks even after it has been washed off.
4,Format media with Windows!,"This worked just fine on a recent trip. The instructions are fairly strait forward. I made a backup to a USB drive for my companion to carry, in case my camera ended up in an unfortunate situation. Nice to have double copies. Downloaded off the copy memory stick to a Windows machine with no errors.Just make sure you format your destination media with a Windows format before you leave - this thing will not recognize items formatted with a Mac.Test it before you need it = less surprises."
3,"Ecstatic, then not so happy","Took this item on my European trip 10/06 - backed up all my photos onto a flash drive, it worked like a charm. I was thrilled when I got home and found everything intact, especially since my 1-gig memory card no longer worked in the camera! That was about 1000 pix I didn't lose!Not so happy today because the Memorex does not power on any more (unknown reasons). I haven't used it since last Nov. but was hoping to...A few other caveats: it does not handle xD cards or certain older card formats (like the one that came with my 2004 digital camera). Also be sure to have plenty of those AAA batteries it needs cuz it sucked up quite a few on my trip."
5,Great Selection,"I purchased this for the first song, I Am The Black Gold Of The Sun, and love the first CD, esp the first 3 cuts. (A 2-CD set) The drummer is unbelievable talented. I recommend it."
4,Excellent Condition,I got this book way before I expected it to arrive. Arrived in excellent condition. CD Rom works great. Although the book itself isnt thorough but I ordered it for the software CD that comes with it. All in all it was a good experience.
1,Not helpful for beginners,"This book does not provide the information I need to succeed in my introductory biostatisitics class. In my opinion, it is poorly written, full of errors and tends to be confusing more than anything else. I have had to seek out other sources of information in order to understand even basic concepts. While this book might be appropriate for those more familiar with biostats, I suggest that beginners find another textbook that might be more helpful to them."
4,good business,"I received the book within 5 days, ordered it on a Thursday and got it Monday afternoon. Book is in good condition. I will definitely will buy from this seller again."
1,definitely not helpful for 'basic' or introductory level,"I have very little background in biostats, and need to learn it for medical research and research design.This book is difficult to read, has far too much emphasis on mathematics and far too little empahisis on concept. After a whole quarter in Biostats using this book, I can tell you very little about how and when to employ certain basis statistics tests or interpret them with confidence. The answers in the back are ofter erroneous, as is some of the text (according to my professor).The only thing I can seay that is good about this test is that the NCSS software that comes with it I think may be helpful at some point.I am back in the market for a better book!"
1,Try another book,"I had to purchase this book for a class I am taking. This is a fourth edition book and I have to correct errors before reading each chapter. I give publishers some leeway on a first edition, but by the fourth the kinks should be worked out. Also, there is some crucial information missing when making the calculations and sometimes it does not give enough detail on how to work through the problems."
4,a great little gift for anyone,"i gave this book as a christmas gift to many of my friends; they absolutely love this inspirational little story! it's very charming! the story is roughly about reicarnation, and believing that we are all connected in life. i love this little book, and the cover design is excellent. the book cover is a thick parchment paper like material with embossed lettering. this is the type of book you can read to your kids at bedtime, or read in the bathtub by yourself for a quick picker upper!"
3,Great for Kids,"I read the book over a couple of nights and found that the writing style was completely different from Scott Pecks other books. I knew the book was mostly for kids, but expected it still to be written at a higher level.The books messages gave me pause for thought (ie: reincarnation and power of God) and I'm glad I read it. I will pass it on to my niece who has a 3 year old."
5,Tsugaru Fusion,If you are into World Music or Shamisen and Taiko music I cannot recommend this CD enough. Shinichi Kinoshita is a master.
3,B-wiz is holding it down,the lyrics and beats are great but the sound quality isnt there. if you want a cd with great lyrics this is it. this cd is worth the money get it.
3,"Dance, Laugh, Eat Cake",I found this book to be quite interesting but nothing I would ever give a five too. But that does not say you won't like. If you are looking for a book to take your time with this is it. It is quite an interesting book.
1,Poorly illustrated,Poorly written and unpleasant quality of photos. It could have been written in much interesting format. Photos should be a part of learning. The quality of the photos are very bad.
1,Awful Book,"This book is extremely difficult to read. Its hard to tell if the author was really trying to teach about the construction industry, or impress himself with how many 10 cent words he could stuff into each run on sentence. Sounds like he is more of a bitter washed up architect than an actual authority on the subject. Avoid this book at all costs."
1,So bad it's funny,"Sounds like someone turned on the ""automatic accompaniment"" feature on his casio keyboard and started hitting keys at random. Comparing this to Kenny G is a compliment."
1,One star is TOO HIGH,"What a self indulgent piece of garbage this is. Unforgivable. A penny is too high a price. He most likely has to PAY people to listen to it, which is probably why we haven't seen a follow up to his debut failure. Let me guess... the childlike scribblings he calls ""art"" are for sale along with that hideous vest he sports on the cover. He will be punished for all eternity for hawking such an abomination. Shame on you, Dietmar"
1,my gummed -up fountain pens,"the green drys out in the nib and GUMS UP my pens. A green 'skin' formed on my nib, and took some serious cleaning to clean up and clean out my pen.the blue drys out in the nib as well. I didn't give it time to gum-up another pen.maybe this is better suited for quill pens, but is a problem in a fountain pen. try Lamy, Shaeffer, Scripto, Parker's Quink, Pelikan or Noodler's Ink...."
3,"Works as advertised , everything ok","key chain i cant really keep in my pocket since its really big, but looks nice, since i am a chevrolet fan i really like although i cant keep it with my all the time"
2,Decieving,the keychain is absolutely massive. way to big to be used on most keychains. Really awkward size. but would be great if it was smaller
5,Nice key ring,"I bought this to hang my 69 Camaro keys on. True, it's big, but I don't have to fish around in my pockets trying to find it. I wish though that Chevy would come out with a 100 Year Anniversary key ring."
2,"Good Quality, way too big for a key chain","Simple as that, way too big for a key chain, unless your into that kind of thing. Good quality."
3,It's a little big,"It's nice, but a little bigger than I thought it would be. Kind of hard to carry such a big thing on a keychain."
5,A treasure of drawings,"I love this book and refer to it whenever I am feeling inadequate about my art. It is inspiring to see the drawings of the great Masters, and the commentary is excellent insight. WONDERFUL book."
1,UTTER GARBAGE,I was VERY disappointed with this long and boring crap. I just kept waiting for it to get better but it didn't. If it even had 10 seconds worth of the music from the trailer in it it would have saved it. But it didn't. Do not buy this.
5,Go for it...When you see it...Just BUY it!!!,"I think Hans is really good at describing the great feelings when people is in a trap...Those SF boys going there, sacrifice for their country,Cherish their brothers in the same line.There`s not to reason why, there`s but to do and died..."
3,Alright I suppose,"This score by Zimmer was actually quite difficult to critsise, it has both amazing choral sequences, fast paced action sequences and boring bits that would seem to work better with a comic book cartoon rather than a film.The best track on the CD is probably the one called 'Sarajevo', its hauntingly atomspheric using a male vocals and small orchestra and fits perfectly with the film.The rest of the CD on the other hand is your basic Zimmer action music which seems to go no-where at some points but gradualy sorts it self out at the end.I would rate this score as being just a tad above average."
4,Zimmer's Best,"Why did I give this 4 stars if it's ""Zimmer's best""?? Simply because there's a whole other hour of music that's not here. This is a good compilation CD, but if you REALLY want the music from The Peacemaker, get the 2CD complete version. Not only does it contain the movie (complete) versions of Devoe's Revenge and The Chase, it contains another hour of music.If you can't get the 2CD, by all means get this. It's right above The Rock and Gladiator."
2,okay,"I listen to a lot of soundtracks, and while I loved the movie, and the opening music, the soundtrack is a bit boring.This cd is not really worth it."
5,Zimmer at his best,"I own several of Zimmer's soundtrack, and though I enjoy ""The Rock"" and ""Broken Arrow"", I would have to say ""The Peacemaker"" is my favorite. It is great to work out to, especially the last 90 seconds of track 4: The Chase. This one is definetly worth owning."
2,Too many mistakes ...,"Too many mistakes for my taste :( There were so many obvious mistakes in this book. If York's simple research on scenes from The English Patient was so inaccurate, it makes me wonder how inaccurate the rest of his research for the book was. (How difficult is it to watch a film and get the quotes/senarios right?) Does have some nice photos."
2,If you must...,"As stated in a previous review, this *biography is definitely for the beginning Fiennes fan. For those who have followed Mr. Fiennes career and *life* for the past 4 years, save your money. Lots of rehash of previous interviews to be found in many magazine,newspaper clippings etc. Chances are you've read this stuff ten times over! No enlightening look into the soul of Mr. Fiennes, at least not anymore than he and author will let you! Besides this reads like a last minute, half-hearted term paper!"
4,Accomplished actor,"As a Fiennes fan I think this book offers a glimpse of life of a very private actor. Fiennes is a fine and accomplished actor regardless his moody and intense personality viewed by many. His private life may not be the ideal for everyone, but it is his personal life. York Membery's writing is just fine, but should Membery always makes deep comparison of Fiennes's widely-viewed personality with the characters in Fiennes's works such as Ivanov and Hamlet?"
2,Worth buying for the pictures.,"For the true fan, this book has nothing new to add. There are even a few mistakes printed. (Can you catch them?) But it reads well and has some beautiful pictures included."
3,"Okay, but got boring quick!","I really look at these 'activity center' software packages for my kids. Unfortunately there wasn't much to go on with this one.The graphics are nice, but the activities get old after about 20 minutes. My 6 year old plowed thru this and got tired of it after 30 minutes!This is one of those software programs that you are better off waiting to buy it when its in the discount rack."
1,Cheap and Broken,"This ring arrived yesterday and I'm going to send it back immediately. When I opened up the little plastic bag the stone was not even in the setting anymore. It apparently came loose from the setting during the shipping process. I thought about gluing the stone back into the setting, but when I examined it closely I was very disappointed. The stone is extremely thin and cheap looking. The ring is also much smaller than the photograph makes it appear.I think it looks like a ring for a young girl and not for a woman.Needless to say, I am not happy with this purchase and I will not be ordering again from this seller anytime soon."
4,Celtic Black Onyx Ring,This is a really nice little ring. I was very impressed at how pretty it is - especially for such a reasonable price.
2,Cheap stone,"I didn't like this one very much and ended up sending it back. The stone just didn't look nice to me in what seemed to be a cheap setting. The price was great, but I didn't think it was worth the money unless you are just looking for a basic inexpensive ring with out the higher end quality appearance."
4,Beautiful Ring,"This ring is beautiful and I really liked it, but they either sent the wrong size or they run small because it didn't fit, so I returned it."
5,Black Onyx Celtic Knot RIng,"This is a great ring for the price. It is smooth, low profile, perfect size ring!"
2,Doesn't live up to its promise,"This book was a disappointment. The text is uninspiring and the photos do not convey the gardens they supposedly portrait. The quality of the photos is very good, but most of them show small sections of the gardens or even just a few plants. Moreover, often the plants shown are rather common.We were hoping to see photos that give an overview of each garden so one gets a feeling for the organization of space, layering of plants, depth, etc. None of that. Just pretty pictures. A few close-up of specimens is great as a complement, but not as the only photos.We know two of the gardens rather well and feel that the photos just don't even come close to conveying any of these gardens' interests. Too bad, should have saved the money for a better book..."
3,At least it fits,"I am not sure what to write here. The bra fits and it is fairly comfortable, but it seems like they could actually make a bra that lifted , separated and did not make groves in your shoulders. This is one of the best ones so far. The little shoulder pad seem like a good idea except I have to scoot them down, because the front adjustable ""hardware"" digs into me, so I pull the shoulder pad thing down to cover it up and pad out the hardware. The front adjustable hardware sounds like a great idea too, and it is except it will dig a sore into your skin pretty fast if you do not scoot the shoulder pad down to cover it up. If there was any other better choices it would give this bra a one star..but hey. Men on the moon, but with earth ladies with baggie boobs! Oh dear!"
5,The Best Series on TV,"The Sopranos has been hailed as the sophisticated show to ever grace television, but it doesn't even hold a candle to the Wire. A devastating, comprehnsive dissection of the decay of American cities and their institutions, the Wire is more comparable to a novel than any other medium.The fourth season takes on the education system, while still following the drug dealers, cops and politicians from previous seasons. And, moreso than past seasons, the results are devastating."
5,The Wire - Fourth Season,"This is yet another excellent season of The Wire. It shows the political side of Baltimore's drug problems in the show. It doesn't focus on the drug scene as much as previous seasons but it is another step in the circular drug world. If you are looking for real, gritty drama this series is definitely for you."
4,maybe the best wire season so far?,another great wire season! maybe the best one so far?a must buy for fans
4,Dookie should have gone on to medical school.,"Dookie is my favorite child from the series not Wallace. Prez showed that instead of ending up at Microsoft, he became the wrong thing in the wrong place because of growing up in an insular ill-informed immigrant Polish American community. What happened to Dookie is so much worse and for me, this season really made me feel the loss of Dookie's potential not Michael's. Dookie's character made me really angry for kids in that situation. Black neighborhoods need teaching hospitals with Black doctors so kids can have that influence in their environment."
1,Missing Disc,"Late to the party on this wonderful series. I gave Season 4 as a gift. When we sat down to watch it, disc one was missing. There were two copies of disc 4. Amazon is giving me a full refund, but I'm reluctant to re-order in case there are more sets like this. Very disappointing."
4,the wire season 4,in a way this was a cool movie. any movie made in Baltimore is cool a little too much cursing for my taste so be sure you don't have kids under age watching this well at least with there parents . hope i helped..
5,The Best Season!!,The Best season yet! This season you see more of the new generation stepping to the forefront and letting you know what the future holds. They take you into the school and let you see how the drug world is effecting the kids and their families! I love The Wire!!
5,Best drama I've seen so far,The Wire over all Four Seasons gets into the socio-political system of USA. Baltimore the city chosen to depict how the structure functions and limitations of the same.Drug trafficking the center of this. But it links all the social issues faced by an average African American in the society. The direction is top class and there is a scope for Season 5. I am looking forward to it.
5,Still consistently excellent,"If you have enjoyed previous seasons of The Wire, then I don't think you'll be disappointed with this one. Branching out into a study of the schools system alongside the more usual police and drug culture storylines, this remains a powerful and fascinating series.The finest programme on television."
5,Excellence in Television,"Without question THE WIRE is evidence of the finest work on television. The fourth season includes Public Education as a topic, and it is dealt with in the same well-written, well-acted, superbly directed manner as the other topics THE WIRE has taken on - Politics, Police, Organized Crime, The War On Drugs, etc."
5,Don't miss this one,"You've seen the first three, right? So what are you waiting for? No disappointments with this one."
5,the best show i've ever seen,"I tend to sit through most of each episode with my jaw dropped in amazement - I can't believe how great this show is. I don't watch much television, but this is unlike anything else I've ever seen. It combines fantastic entertainment with stark reality - I've learned so much from this series. I wish it would go on for another five years..."
5,YES,Great job!!! I would buy from you again and again. I look for forward to doing business with you again. The greatest series ever!
5,Series,"Although this is a work of fiction, the story reveals life in the ghetto and it's really sad when you think about what is really happening to our children in the streets! It shows how thug life is handed down from generation to generation until someone ""just says NO""!"
5,Best HBO series,"Absolutely great series, just as good as ""Sopranos"". No matterif it's the first or this fourth season now, they are all equal.Very, very good!!!!!"
5,One of the most realistic shows on television.,"After coming away from the amazing third season of Ed Burns's 'The Wire', one can't help but approach the fourth with skepticism. The bar was, in actuality, lifted yet again as this fantastically well casted and acted show continues to keep me burning through the episodes."
4,Last vestige of the originals--unique Freshmen edition.,"This is close to being the last recording bearing the sound of the original Freshmen, since peerless lead tenor Bob Flanigan is still with the group. Traditionalists may be quick to dismiss the session because of the program, consisting of much pop ephemera from the 70s and 80s. Give it a chance. As much as I ignored the overrated original song material (by Christopher Cross, Donald Fagen, Stevie), the Freshmen do the period a favor by turning banal folk, disco and soul tunes into stunning evergreens. Unlike past and future editions, this group (which I caught live circa 1990) employed an electronic synthesizer-keyboard, permitting the inclusion of more current repertory. The main thrust behind the selection of songs and arrangements for this, the most ""contemporary sounding,"" Freshmen unit was keyboardist-trombonist Rod Henley. For anyone who's interested in a fairly representative collection of the Freshmen, this one deserves to be included."
4,well priced,This cane was very well priced. You should be aware that this sucker is HEAVY. It's a real workout to use it. I think I will use it only on wet days when i am worried about slipping with my usual cane. Also the hard plastic rubber handle is not very comfortable if you are used to a foam rubber handle.
2,not up to expectations,"I thought the cane would be good on slippery surfaces like snow and/or ice, but it's not sturdy, The curved handle seems to make it wobbly. When I use a regular cane with the shaft straight down from the handle, it's much more solid. It's also easy to kick the quads with your foot when walking. I've tripped on it a couple of times. The only good feature is it stands alone -- you don't have to put it up against a wall or whatever and have it end up on the floor. I'd never buy another cane with that handle design."
3,Depends on What You're Looking For,"If you want to learn how to use PGP from a UNIX command line, this is the book for you. If you want to know the history of encryption and the development of PGP as a tool. This, too, may be the book for you.If you want to use the Windows version of PGP, this is not the book for you.Simon Garfinkel's PGP is certainly informative and is written in light, breezy language that makes it easy reading for even the least technical. But, sadly, this book is so out of date as to be entirely useless with regard to actually using PGP today."
3,Good service,"The shipper sent to my address overseas on time. This is good service. Good job!I didn't give him 5 stars because the CD is not a good one, cannot play the last song. But it's hard for me to return since it's overseas..."
2,Okay,"This game got really high reviews and I was excited for something different, but overall I think it's pretty lame. My daughter is 9 and very ""into"" card games, but this one really misses.The tin is cute and the cards are durable though."
3,Another frog...,"I wish K-Mart would go back to exchanging lousy X-Mas gifts no questions asked. Heck, I would even take a Steeplechase Sweater worn by Mr. Arrendondo for 30 years over this lousy gift. No wonder I was not ready with good riffs after hearing this. I'm not sure what this band is doing- I hear some potential here. But, once again, this sound is tired like yesterday's Taco Bell Gordita Crunch."
4,A book for literalists,Prof. Bringas lucidly points out the dangers of believing every word in the Bible is true. Page after page describes the cost of such a practice. He also shows how Historical Criticism opens a more positive way to read and use the Bible.
4,An excellent conclusion to the Dominion War series,"After three previously successful novels, Diane Carey's second DS9 novelization in the series promised to deliver all of the thrills and chills prevalent in the other entries. It doesn't disappoint. The storyline in Sacrifice of Angels follows the Federation's desperate attempt to halt the imminent arrival of Dominion reinforcements through the wormhole, and turn the tide of the war by retaking station Deep Space Nine. While stalwart Captain Benjamin Sisko and his crew aboard the Defiant lead the Federation's charge, Major Kira and her associates aboard DS9 carry on the fight in their own way. The characterization is good and the space battle sequences are top-notch. Diane Carey's second Deep Space Nine novelization is always entertaining, and acts as an excellent conclusion to the Dominion War series."
3,Lots of fun but average quality,"The puzzle is designed somewhat difficult but not to the degree that discourages my 3 years old daughter to ensemble them. The most difficult part is the two big dinosaurs' bodies have similar patterns, thus she is a bit frustrated sometime but always comes back and finishes them. The only problem I have is its quality. There are many pieces are slightly banned. Based upon all the puzzles we bought, I think Melissa & Doug has better quality."
5,Great Book!,"Karen Kingsbury is a wonderful author. Her books are well written and easily understood. This book, Be Safe Little Boy, Words of Love for Moms, is great and the illustrations are worth the time to look at."
5,Mother of 4 boys,"The book was a gift for my daughter who us the mother of four boys....ages 10, 8, 3 and 18 months. Karen Kingsbury was recommended. The book was received in record time and good condition. Thank you for the prompt service."
2,Disappointing,"I too was looking forward to this CD. First of all let me say that this is a very poor recording from a technical standpoint. The microphone placement was extremely poor and there was little adjustment of levels by the engineer throughout. The piano is overwhelming the clarinet many times especially in the f minor sonata. In fact it the balance is just bad with the piano extremely loud.Secondly Harold Wright's playing on this CD is not what it was earlier in his career. This CD was made I believe a year or so before his untimely death. If you are purchasing this CD as your only copy of the Brahms clarinet sonatas, there are much better recordings out there, especially in regard to recording quality. This CD is valuable if you want to hear Wright's playing but you must get past the poor quality of recording, which I found difficult to do."
5,"Helpful for teachers, students, parents, and home schooling.","This book is easy to use to assess student writing, but it's also easy for students to use in the process of writing. I have used it for elementary students through college students. The charts in the back are helpful, as are the samples of writing in the chapters."
3,1997 Gordon highlights short on driving action,"As a Jeff Gordon fan, I enjoyed this video, but I was left wanting for more driving action. In races where Jeff did not win, you were sometimes lucky to even see a picture of the track, much less any real driving action. In races where Jeff won or was involved in some event (usually a crash), some footage was offered. A fun video, but less of Jeff talking and more of him driving would have garnered more stars from me."
5,Excellent,"What can you say about one of the highest grossing comics of today. an awsome cd, extremely funny."
3,"Live bits are great, the rest is mediocre","This is not a live stand up comedy album. There are a few bits that were recorded in front of an audience, and those are all very funny. The majority of the record consists of studio recorded ""skits"", which are very medicore. The studio stuff is the kind of thing you hear on morning radio. I was very disapointed, mainly because I only got a taste of how funny Chris Rock can be on stage."
3,he has moments,"he has moments and has quick wit and commentary but that alone doesn't for me put him on par with the likes of richard pryor,bill cosby,rudy ray moore,or eddie murphy and redd foxx etc.barely on par with martin lawrence.i haven't felt all the juice he gets.he is alright but for me way overrated."
1,worst racially based comedy ever,i did not enjoy this cd. it was racist and sexually explicit. not funny at all.
2,"Little new in ""Roll With the New""","Let me preface this review by saying that I am a huge Chris Rock fan, having bought nearly everything that he has done on both DVD and CD. But ""Roll With the New"" is little more than select excerpts from ""Bring the Pain"" with a few sophomoric Ren & Stimpy style toss-ins, which really aren't up to Chris Rock's normal level. Somebody at Dreamworks figured they could make a boat load of extra money by tossing in 20% original though mediocre content with regurgitations of the best parts of BTP.Do yourself a favor: Save your money and get more laughs by buying ""Bring the Pain"" and ""Bigger and Blacker"" instead."
4,"Hilarious, but some falls short of expectations","I have laughed many an hour away with this album. However, some of the short bits fall short of the standup maestro that he is. Variety? Sure, there's variety, but something just doesn't work with the non-standup bits. They are funny, just not as top notch as aforementioned. I do agree that Chris Rock -is- the funniest man in America. Enjoy!"
4,I am sure he sounds better on stage,"Chris Rock is surely one powerful comedian, but this CD does not do him justice. There are too many studio-mixed tracks, too much auxiliary stuff beside his straightforward stand-up act, but it is Chris Rock talking that you want to hear, not annoying interference of second-grade content that is equivalent to warm-up artist at a superstar's concert.His texts are impeccable, delivery is powerful with finely judged rhytm. It is this rhytm that captivates and brings you to the climax of laughter."
3,There are really good parts in this but.........,I love Chris Rock but I think that the skits were a bit much and he could just stick to the standup. It was cool though. The parts that were funny were ridiculously funny and I could listen to them over and over again
3,Pretty good,"The ""live"" segments of the CD are really good, but, I could have done without the tracks in between. If you cut those out, the other 1/2 of the CD (actual ""live"" recording instead of the skit-type tracks) it's really funny."
3,"Half brilliant, half completely lame","About half the tracks on this CD hit home and are clever, incisive, and funny. But the rest of it is worse than a high school performance. Very inconsistent CD. If Chris ever comes out with a ""Best Of"", that would be the one to buy..."
3,"It's pretty good, I guess.....","I think that this CD is funny as hell but there are a lot of dumb clips that make you feel like you have wasted your money. It's wroth having though, so just record it off a friend!"
3,Still miss the older stuff,"Just didn't have the punch and fury exhibited on the onlyother Pat(rick) Williams I own...""Threshold"" (Capitol), oneof the FINEST, ALL-TIME POWERHOUSE BIG BAND LPs OF ALL TIME!!!Also recommended: ""Images"" (Michel LeGrand with Phil Woods)"
2,Not what you could expect,"Amistad's soundtrack is not memorable - not even beautiful. I remember wanting John to win over James Horner with Titanic; I don't anymore. The movie was boring, and so is the soundtrack. Poor, Williams!"
1,BE WARNED! The mp3 download is NOT THE ORIGINAL SCORE!,"This is extremely misleading. The download is NOT the score. Do not be fooled! What it SOUNDS like is that someone ripped the vocals from the acutal soundtrack, and then used a standard onboard 128 voice midi synth to replace the score, and then somehow Amazon let them attach it to the soundtrack like it was a real product, so they can steal your money.Great soundtrack, but do NOT BUY THE MP3 DOWNLOAD!!!"
4,Excellent music,The members of RiZen definitely have a relationship with Jesus Christ and it is evident in the passion with which they minister in song. I recommend this CD for anyone who wants to meditate on the Word of God and on the goodness of Jesus.
3,RISE LADIES,"i LOVE THE VOCAL ABILITY OF THE GROUP RIZEN. ""VIEW THE CITY"" AND ""TRUST AND NEVER DOUBT"" ARE VERY GOOD SONGS BUT THE REST OF THE ALBUM DIDN'T REALLY PULL ME IN. NOT BAD BUT NOT GREAT."
1,Too old school for me!,"The CD is not as good as the cover art. The songs are all very old. It seems like a very amateur project. Only one girl does most of the singing. She's cool, but it gets old fast. I would not recommend this CD to anyone who likes Virtue or Trinitee 5:7 or any type music like this."
5,WOW!!!!,"This CD is unbeliveable... These young ladies are just belting notes all the way through the 14 cuts. This CD is a must have for any music lover. If you like foot stompin', hand clapping music and spine crawling notes, this is your CD.. I'm a RiZen fan from here out!!!"
4,How Is The Gov't Doing? Let Me Check The Dow First!!!!!,"Popkin argues that the public is not as uninformed as we are lead to believe. The media would have us think that Joe Sixpack is more familiar with Joe Camel than Joe Biden. That might be, but that does not mean that they cannot reach smart decisions. They can reach decisions that would be similar to those that they would reach had they been fully informed. They can do this through the use of shortcuts. A shortcut could be the movement of the DOW or their price of gas, but what must happen is that the shortcut must be relevant for the person's life. The shortcut must be something they can link to politics based on their experience. These shortcuts can be misguided, but more often than not they work to advance the interests of those using the shortcut. This is a good book, which is not too ivory tower to avoid it being accessible for most readers. So get it and enjoy."
2,Overrated,"Largely overrated work of political science. Noble effort at bridging diverse strands of research into a single theory, but evidentiary support for argument simply insufficient. Chapters on primaries remain interesting, yet irrelevant at best...harmful to author's theoretical framework at worst."
4,"Good, except for the brush","I bought two of these sets from Amazon.com and I love the mat, the great spatula and the solidly made ""whip."" I have to admit, the mat itself is the main attraction here and it works amazingly well. Baked cheese puffs with an egg wash cleaned up in just less than a minute, and the tray did not even have to be washed at all. The cookies I have made on it do seem to require a little extra cooking time now, but everything certainly cleans up easily.Unfortunately, the pastry brush started falling apart immediately. After only one use, the bristles started falling out and were found on the food! After the second use, the red plastic strip holding the brush together cracked and parts fell off. I threw out one of these two pastry brushes already. (Perhaps it is my own fault because I put it in the dishwasher!)This set is worth it for the other three items, nonetheless. I am happy with the purchase overall."
2,very small,read the size before you buy! very small and not as handy as what we wanted. Will read the small print better in the future... also this is not steam resistant.
3,Recommended for this course,"I would recommend the audio CDs to complement the coursework. You may ask ""Why get the audio CDs when the textbook comes with an audio computer CD?"". For me, I don't like to by tied to the computer to practice. I also want to listen in the car. The CDs are overpriced but are we going to be serious about this or not? I give the CDs only three stars because the ""repeat after the speaker"" exercises do not give the learner enough time to repeat unless you are looking at the text. I would also like to see substitution drills on the CDs. If you are an English learner at this level, I encourage you to keep going even if you perceive that you have plateaued. You have come this far, keep going!!"
1,get albums of slim whitman,"In the past it was hard to get albums of slim whitman in Holland, now these day's it's much harder to get a CD of slim whitman.I love the music of slim whitman and I will keep on searchin for CD's.I also like music of Frank Ifield, Marty Robbins and Bobby Goldsboro.I don't believe that this CD was released in holland, I never have seen or heard it.I love the sound of the ""old"" country songs, and perhaps someone over there can help me, and tell me me where to buy or seargh for these records.please contact me if you can help mejan.romijn@smead-europe.com or srensema@freeler.nl"
5,Ok,Liked item but won't be purchasing it another. Item was for my personal daily use and one DYD is sufficient
1,It was A bootlegged DVD that was not functional,This DVD was a gift to my nephew and it wasnt functional. it was over rode with commentary on top of the actual movie and it was confusing. I tried to go to the main menu and try to replay it thinking it was an error on my behalf. There was no main menu or action to do this... Finally i Just took the dvd out. What a waste of money!
3,"Kid loved it, but JR was a brat","My son loves to watch veggie tales, the animation in this episode is great and there are some wonderful Wizard of Oz references.[Spoilers]However in the climax of the episode Jr Asparagus turns into a brat when he doesn't get his way with the Wizard. The theme park is a business and Jr wants everything for free and throws a fit when he doesn't get his way. I would never want my son acting like that.If you're tore between this and the League of Incredible Vegetables, go with the league, it's much better."
3,ok,ok movie-heavy on the religion-but then-its supposed to be. my 5 yr. old liked it but only watched it a few times.
1,Should be clearly labeled,"As with content that is mature which we have a rating for, there should also be a clear rating for religious material and misleading content. The ""Veggie-Tales"" series not only has strong Christianity themes, but is also anti-vegetarian (or pro-meat) and shows the ""veggies"" eating meat products, very confusing for kids as they are growing up trying to make good eating choices and understanding where meat comes from and of course that vegetables do NOT eat meat would be a good start.As a vegetarian family, we received it as a present from a well-wishing relative, but I was shocked when I saw it with my kids- it needs to be clearly labeled."
3,Not as good as other Veggie movies.,"I was a little disapointed with this Veggie Tales, while it was still enjoyable, it just didn't have the same sense of humor as others have in the past."
4,Black Hills Escape,"I found the ""Visions and Lullabies"" story line different from what I expected, by the title. It reflects the alienation that many feel in the increasingly complex and enthralling world in which we live. I think many of us fantasize about escaping the urban jungle, but, alas, few of us take the steps to actually leave the security of the city for the uncertainty and danger of the wilderness - what little of it there still exists.Like the hero of the story, if we were to seek a more simple world we would find that others have gone before and that we are not alone.Sadly, the reaction of the governmental powers that be are quite likely to respond as represented in this fine story. It is well worth the reading."
5,This calendar gets better every year!,"I can't say enough good things about the Ferret Company's 2004 calendar. I just received my copy in the mail, and wow, Jeanne Carley has outdone herself once again. This calendar is too cute for words.There may be other ferret calendars out there, but this one is without question THE BEST. I am forever amazed at Ms. Carley's incredibly imaginative and endearing photographic images. Every image captures the pure joy that is the domesticated ferret. Just look at this year's cover. Does that not melt your heart? Whether you own a ferret or not, you can't help but love this calendar. Buy one for yourself, and buy one for a ferret loving friend. You won't be disappointed."
5,Ferret Feelings captures the full range!,"I especially love the ""dance around the May pole"" which captures the full range of a Ferret ""happy dance"". I look forward to each year's calendar with anticipation of the Ferret magic Jeanne Carley has managed to capture.Having one of these calendars at work helps me to educate Californians about Ferrets.Having one at home entertains the family while providing lots of space to write notes about our activities and appointments."
5,Adorable,This is a must have for ferret lovers. Every year the pictures get cuter and cuter.(If that's possible!)
1,An Amazing Calendar!,"I received my new calendar on 8/9 and couldn't wait to open it! The pictures are incredible. Great thought and creativity went into planning the 2004 calendar and it shows. It is as wonderful as all the previous years! The mini-calendar is a special addition and will hang well on a wall in an office. Now you can not only have the larger calendar at home, but you can enjoy the smaller one at work! The pictures are sure to bring a smile to your face! I recommend this calendar to all ferret owners and ferret lovers out there!"
5,Legalize Ferrets!,"In the increasingly dismal yet plentiful field of the calendar industry, the Ferret Company calendar is always whimsical, surprising and fun, and never to be missed. This year's edition is no different. With a tip of the hat to Wegman, the ferrets are photogenic, with just a bit of teeth to take the edge off their cuteness."
5,some nice improvments,"The new layout of AE 7.0. is very smart and organised. Your workspace (project, composition, timeline, render queue and others) are all docked in one window. You move the window, you move them all. Yet, if you want to move these individually, you can easily ""undock"" them. You can create your own workspace.The Animation pre-sets are a treat. Here you can create backgrounds with a click and drag of a mouse. These pre-sets can also be adjusted as well. Other pre-sets include Behaviours, Transistions, Paths, Image Special Effects, colour corrections, Text Animations, and even Sound Effects.The other nice thing is the ""graph editor"" option in the time line. Now, like the Discreet products like Flint and Flame, you can make adjustments to your comps by looking at a graph of each parameter.All in all, I think things run much smoother and the changes make your work much quicker."
5,love it,"I bought this toy (i mean santa got this) for my 3 1/2 year old daughter for christmas. she hasn't seen it yet, but i know she'll love it. i took a spin on it in our basement (i'm a rather chubby mom) and it was sooo fun. i might have to buy one for myself. all you do is move the handles back and forth and it gets you going. easy as can be. it's very durable and will last for years i'm sure. it seemed a little expensive for a family on a budget, but it's definately worth it. i give it five stars!"
5,Great Toy!!! Holds more than expected limit,My 2 year old son got one of these for Easter and loves it. We all ride it out on the blacktop. It can carry my husband and I which hoover around 275. I can't say enough about how fun this is. I had something similar when I was a kid but it would scrape your knuckles if you hit the smallest rock. This is far superior. Buy One!! You won't regret it.
5,plasma car,This the second plasma car I purchased. My grandchildren always would ride them at DutchWonderland amusement park so when I saw they were available to buy I bought them so they could ride them at home.A three year old can manuver the car as well as their parents. It was easy to put together and is a very sturdy toy.
2,Destroys hard wood floors,"My 2.5 and 4.5 year olds love to ride these cars. The problem is they destroy your wood floors. We have quarter sawn white oak floors. The front wheels leave long scratches when the vehicle is turned. The rear plastic wheels press tiny grooves into the wood, destroying the floors. The area that extends from my kitchen Island around the front stairs, down the hall and back now has more grooves than a phonograph record. We have lots of other riding toys in the house and have never had this problem. The vehicle is constructed well. The largest flaw is the low quality wheels. We have some 90mm rollerblade wheels on order and we'll attempt to replace the stock wheels. If this doesn't work, they'll be banished for basement only use."
4,Purchased for grandaughter,"This toy is excellent!! A great ""green"" invention,and so much fun. My grandaughter loves it and it is easy to transport because of it's lightweight body. It is plastic but seems to support her very well and moves great."
4,Best Present my 8 Year Old Ever Got,We have 5 kids 1-13 yrs. They LOVE these 2 plasma cars!!! Our 8 year old says it is the best gift he has ever gotten. They race and ride them on the tile every day. (Doesn't work too well on the carpet). Even our 21 month old pushes it around with his feet....They even get Mom and Dad on them!! Great family gift! Thanks!
5,Plasma car,The kids loved the plasma car. The 5 yr old had it down when riding it but it took the 3 yr old a little longer to catch on.
4,Very sturdy,"This has been a major success in our house. My niece is the main user of this, and she is a very rough kid. She has picked this up outside and not so gently put it back down on the concrete. It has held up wonderfully.It uses just enough of a child's energy that it gives them a good workout, but doesn't cause such exhaustion that the child loses interest or becomes tired of using it quickly."
5,Grandkids love it!,"No quams with purchasing this item. Already familiar with the product because family owns one, but had to buy second to make things fair! The grandchildren love it! Easy assembly, durable, even great in the house (especially on hardwood floors). May have to purchase one to ride to work on...just kidding!"
5,Girls Just Want to Have Fun,"We have 2 girls who are ages 3 1/2 and 2, and two boys who are ages 14 and 12 1/2. The plasma car has been great. Our older sons can ride it with their younger siblings and they make lap after lap around our wood floors. In addition, the 2 year old treats it as a little trike and flies through the house chasing her older sister on her radio flyer scooter (the plamsa car is much faster when ridden like a ride on toy.) Even with ages of children ranging from pampers to puberty, we have found many uses for this toy....its a keeper and a second one will be on the way soon."
3,The Good and Bad,"Great toy---almost magical---in ideal conditions. My daughter loved, I mean LOVED it inside on our ceramic tile floor. Our almost smooth driveway was also some fun. Our asphalt culdesac and quiet street were a disaster. She was VERY disappointed that the thing barely moved on the street. The closer you can get to glass to ride this thing on the better. But even our slightly ""pebbly rough"" street is way too much for it. You would easily have thought it would have been fine! If I knew this ahead of time, I probably wouldn't have bought it. We will have to drive somewhere just to use it outside other than our short steeper driveway. Consider where you have a VERY smooth surface, an area recently paved or recoated at least, before you buy. When it works (5+ stars)---it's great, when it doesn't it's just a big dissappointment (0- stars)."
2,WHERE'S THE BEEF????,"I ordered this for my step MIL because online it looks like a full size gift box, and several of the other reviewers raved about how great it was so I thought I'd give it a try. The box is a little on the small side but is decent. Once you open the shrink wrapped box to get everything out it looks VERY skimpy. I paid almost $70 for it, and it looks like it might be worth $20 if that -- and that's only because of the box. The ""truffles"" and ""english tea"" as well as the ""angel candles"" all look like they're from the dollar store. I'm VERY disappointed with this product."
2,spoons received not spoons ordered,"When selecting grapefruit spoons to order, I looked at the details a little differently than most might. My focus was on the handle of the spoon. Yes, I wanted it to be attractive, yet a simple design. However, most important to me was the width of the handle. Due to issues that have developed with my right hand, I require a handle with a little width. These spoons appeared to meet my needs. However, the spoons I received are not the spoons in the picture. The spoons I received have a more narrow handle that is plain. Disappointed."
4,"A good, basic set","These are a good basic set of spoons. The spoons I got look different than the picture, mine have a yellow rubber handle on them. My only complaint, and maybe this is how all grapefruit spoons are, is they are a little short. It's hard to hold them well in your hand. For sure they are not uncomfortable nor am I unable to use them, they just could have a better fit with a longer handle. Otherwise, they are great."
1,Bait & Switch!,I ordered these spoons thinking that I was getting the ones pictured and the Norpro Brand as listed. I was sent a different set of spoons and a different brand. I am trying to match my existing spoons and that is why I ordered these spoons. I now have to jump through hoops to get these returned. The set that was sent to me is thinner metal and cheaper looking. I made the mistake of not ordering items fulfilled by Amazon but Amazon needs to take some responsibility for people and companies that sell through their website. Don't order these spoons if you are expecting to get the Norpro spoons pictured with the design at the end of the handle.
5,Grapefruit spoons,"I am very happy with my spoons. Good quality,sharp enough to cut grapefruit, good size,and very friendly handle comfortable to hold. I am going to buy them for my friend as a gift. Recommend them highly."
4,Good for oranges too,Does a great job cutting the juicy sections from grapefruit and also oranges. I bought a set after using this product at my friends' house.
5,A very comfortable boot,A very comfortable boot to wear. When you lace up you get the sense it fits like a glove which a good boot should. A good buy for the money.
2,Shoes laces outlasted the soles!,I bought this boots for my husband work and the sole of the shoes came apart leaving him with excellent shoe laces.
1,What a waste,My red wings lasted nine months before the soles fell off. I have pieces of shoe all over my truck. I honestly thought I was buying a great product but it was a waste of $250.00. Only a cheap product will offer a 30 day warranty along with the limited 1 year warranty. I truly feel ripped off. The cheap Walmart boots lasted three times longer.
3,Bones,"The title of this movie was not what I expected. It is about people looking for dinosaur bones. It was a good movie overall, but not for a sci-fi buff. I did enjoy the movie, but the title should have been Hunting Dinosaur Bones. It did have some action and suspense. I can recommend this movie as a good movie, but not a sci-fi movie."
4,"Ghosts of our Oldest City, St Augustine","Published in 1997, this is a great collection of ghost stories of our nation's oldest city. One gets the flavor of this city, the Spanish quarter, the lighthouse, Flagler College, among the unique buildings and places reported to be haunted. Anyone who has ever walked the historic district at night can attest to the strong feeling of history and it certainly can make one wonder if they are really alone. A great little book, and a nice start to the library of anyone who travels... usually regional collections of ghost stories are available in many localities, and they make a unique remembrance of a trip. After reading this, perhaps you will be willing to brave a night in room 3A at the St. Francis Inn!"
5,A perfect complement to the historic ambience of this city,"After taking the wonderful nighttime walking ""Ghost"" tour of the nation's oldest city last year, I was disappointed to find that there was no written volume documenting these stories, despite the availability of many books of local historical flavor. Imagine my surprise and excitement when this new volume was published! A well written and FUN collection of stories, mostly of seemingly harmless or friendly entities, with only a smattering of evil or sinister happenings. The author's own review listed here is very unbiased and sincere, including the age range . Enjoyable for adults and all but the youngest children!"
4,A great little book about a very special place.,"Anyone that has an interest in hauntings and historical places will really enjoy this book! Although I have read all sorts of ""serious"" books regarding St. Augustine nothing reflects the local flavor as well as this book. St. Augustine is a wonderful resource of people, places, and things to do. The book does a great job of emphasizing this point. Take a litte time to read this special book."
1,dissapointed,I bought the book hoping for some actual solid stories to help me with my research. What I found was a collection of 'tourist' stories with no thrill and little substance. It seems as though it was written for the sheer purpose of selling and leaves very much to be desired in both content and technique.
4,hi,the product is good. but i received it in about thirty days i was disappointed in it cas i have paid for fast mail and i was supposed to receieve in three days.thanks.
5,sisters guardian angel,"Absolutely love this product, with death close to my door its nice to give my Sisters something to remember me!"
1,A modest Biography of Sony,This is a book that will go down as a greek tragedy. Mr Nathan implies in the introduction that this is a work independent of Sony involvement but the more I read on it seemed that he was protecting the company and information is scarce. And what about the pictures of some of the products that are discussed? especially the Transistor radio that sony initially developed. There are no pictures except for the founders and executives. I am saddened by the lack of content.....
2,Not a good book for studying Japan,The book is boring. It does not talk about Sony's relationship with the politicians or Sony's investments outside Japan. It does not talk about company's structure or the kind of people working in Sony.
4,Great insight into the Corporate Giant Sony!,I found this to be a great read as far as the history of S-O-N-Y Corporation. It takes the reader from the family heritage of a well renowned Sake producer to breaking Japanese tradition and starting an electronics supplier business all the way to the late nineties. The book focuses on the relationships that existed within the high ranks of Sony America and the power related to positions held by Americans. Very interesting look into the Japanese business culture and how they adapted to deal in the U.S. market.
1,"Ok, But for total beginners","I was not impressed with this video at all. It lacks instruction, although it features a variety of Swing moves and styles. The instructions are too fast and they're quite hard to follow. I Have to say that this video might be helpful to someone who is a total beginner. I found a better video with good/clear instruction. It's called Swing Dancing,"
2,Pass this up!,"Pass this video up if you are under 40 or if you don't want to look like one those stuffy ballroom dancers on PBS. However, this video is good for first timers and does give you an idea of the main types of swing. The Lindy is kinda skecthy to me though. Luckily I borrowed this one from the library."
5,Good,Used it as part of a Halloween costume.Worked good and would recommend if you wanted a cheap white body suit.
2,This series is hit-or-miss,"I can appreciate that these books are meant to be goofy and fun, but they tend to stray into distasteful. The characters are sixth graders, but the reading level is about third grade or younger.We've read most of the series, and I think my favorite is ""From Bad to Verse"". Almost every book in the series shows kids acting irreverantly toward parents/authority and disrespectfully toward one another.Plenty of underpants humor. Divorced parents, with a ""cool"" dad.I prefer the Geronimo Stilton books -- they are more uniformly charming and innocent."
3,fair for the price,"The shelves look very nice themselves, but, as others have said, the mounting, although easy to do, leaves the shelves feeling unsturdy. I would certainly limit the weight on them.On the other hand, the mounting hardware is poor at best. The fasteners that are supposed to screw into the wall are of the poorest quality. After drilling holes, three of the six actually CRUMBLED as I touched them. I wound up using my own subsitiutes to insure a stable mount."
5,Amazingly easy to put up,"As long as you know that they're not made of wood (although parts that don't show are), this is a nice easy-to-put-up set of picture ledges. I got mine at a big box store that has these in other styles and colors. Took me less than 5 minutes to get these up, thanks to the level being there on the plastic piece. All mounting nails and (if they're needed) anchors are included. All you need is a hammer. If you intend to put other than a picture on this ledge, I suggest weighing the pieces together keeping the total weight to less than 10 pounds. These are not shelves, only shallow ledges. I'm very happy with their appearance."
5,Great product,"These shelves are a wonderful product. They are attractive, lightweight, and extremely easy to install. The lip on the edge ensures that your knick knack or frame won't slide off."
1,Very flimy fake wood and not all hardware included as stated,"I got started mounting these shelves on my wall and was so excited because I love them. First thing I noticed is that they aren't real wood but some sort of faux wood look alike. I could deal with that so I kept going. I got the first large shelf mounted *they do not suck up to the wall well and are a bit wobbly*Then I got to the small and medium shelves I realized that I had an abundance of nails but was short 4 of the large anchor screws that are supposed to be included. So it appears now that, after paying a decent amount of money for an item that was supposed to include everything I am going to have to go to a hardware store and try to find something that will work and spend even more money! I am not impressed with this! I would not recommend this product to anyone! It is not worth the price and extra effort/cost."
2,Wimpy,"I bought these shelves to put above my baby's changing table for keeping wipes, lotions, etc. If that's what you need, don't buy these! They wobble and are not meant for daily use. They would probably do fine keeping light knick-knacks that were never touched. Also, they are supposed to be put in the wall with several nails that are hammered in at an angle. Very bad idea! When I tried to move the shelf to another room, the nails were very hard to remove and took huge chunks of the wall with them. Overall, I am very disappointed and will be making my own shelves."
2,"Pass on this one, lots of personal opinion, little technical meat...","Pass on this one...there are better books out there on the subject. I bought this book expecting a good overview on the M1 Garand. I'm new to the Garand but have been collecting and shooting firearms for many years and thought this would be a good overview...I was wrong. The book was full of attitude, anti-gun control rant, and unrelated opinion. I don't think this guy had an editor...if he did, I hope he didn't pay him. This was a disorganized bunch of topics mostly about rebuilding Garands from parts kits? He often references his previous book on the same subject so thankfully I know to avoid it too. There was actually very little technical information, the pictures were dark, and the book didn't even explain how to field strip the M1. The best part was the Preface section but it went downhill from there...more fiction than fact."
2,Forgetable,The author salts almost every chapter with anti-gun control rants that distract from the ostensible subject of the book.
2,"Misprinted, duplicate sections?","I dont what the deal is, this looks like some weird misprint, I have duplicate sections. and a duplicate forward Not at all what I expected. very dissapointed in quality control."
3,Nice tribute to a master of residential architecture,"This book does do a commendable job of disecting Adler's major works and the research is quite good, though it could have used more photos. I must stipulate that the photos used are quite good. Note to publisher the cover photo, with Adler's name vertically imbosed cheapened the look of the book, although the back photo was excellent. If you are fan of Adler I recommend this book, but with slight reservations, look at my other reviews to find truely great books on American Master Architects. I'm a tenacious reviewer, but if I say a book is great, I'll bet you will agree. I really do try to write reviews that will help people, not just give them a positive synopsis, these books are expensive and some are great, some are good, like this one, and some are just plain disappointing. Anyway, I really hope this helps you in some way, if not...well this is a minute of your life you will never get back."
3,NOTHING TO FEAR,"In this 4th book I gave it 3 stars because I loved the romance between Dana & Ethan. I loved reading about what happened to Caroline, Max, Tom, & Evie. I didn't like the storyline or the killer."
4,Good as always,"This is not my favorite book from Karen Rose, but as always she delivered a very good storyline and amazing characters.I highly recommend!"
4,Gripping Read,"""Nothing to Fear"" was a book which was hard to put down. It's an easy read, reasonably well written and suspenseful with a romantic element."
1,Forced myself to finish this,I usually adore this author's books but this one was dry and boring and the characters were shallow without a lot of depth to them. It felt almost like it was a cookie cutter book pushed out to meet a deadline. Granted there were some sections like the beginning that kept me reading but the middle and end were dead zones.
3,a tad too gory,"Hardworking caseworker inadvertently houses a vengeful & murderous ex-convict & the boy she's holding for ransom. She meets attractive PI who's looking for the boy & his kidnapper but both keep their mission a secret while embarking on an affair until clues lead them to each other's secrets.My 1st Rose book & I liked her writing. Meaty & gripping. Romance, sexual chemistry, & love scenes were pretty good. I just didn't care for the gory details of the torture/killings. It was quite chilling. I like my romance-suspense lighter on the horror/violence details.Recommended for suspense & even the romance but be warned of its violence."
5,Splendid Guide,"Frank LaLumia has succeeded where many authors fail - providing excellent instruction in a concise manner. His own works are inspiring and his command of the various media is impressive, but his greatest strength is that he explains in a page or two concepts that other books mumble on about for entire chapters. I was delighted and inspired by this artist's stunning first book. Keep on writing, Mr. LaLumia!"
5,Want To Have More Detailed Information On A Sailing Topic?,"Have you forgotten some of the terminology or manovers you learned in a sailing course last year? Are you an experienced sailor but would like more detailed information on a subject?This book has all the answers to the questions many novice sailors have; from parts of the boat, commands, moanovering in a harbour to sailor terminology. Themes also go into great detail on the subject matter accompanied with excellent illustrations to re-enforce your learning of a subject. It doesn't matter if your are a seasoned salt or new to the world of cruising. It belongs on every sailors book shelf."
5,An outstanding resource for beginning to experienced sailors,"For me, a recreational sailor of over twenty years, this book has been like the bible. I've used it for voyage preparation, to teach new sailors and, when I wrote my sailing mystery novel, Inner Passages, this book was my first and primary resource!Sometimes, late at night, nostalgic for the sensation of a sailboat deck underfoot once more, I pull it off the shelf and just dip inside. It evokes memories, reminds me of trips gone by, and I cam almost smell the sea air. This latest edition, replete with fine illustrations, should be a primary addition to any sailor's library."
4,Great all around sailing tex,A nice updated edition from the prior one I had. General information for the novice and experienced sailor. Ready for another update based on outdated technology and navigational information but a great read.
4,"The Annapolis Book of Seamanship, 34rd Edition","Very informative, well organized and simple to understand for the inexperienced sailor as well as those who have a basic understanding of sailing. Very helpful."
4,Works as expected,"We received these items as a wedding gift 7months ago. They work well as expected. My only complaint is that the press is hard to clean because of the graphic, I may also be using the wrong cleanser."
3,bacon press,"I wanted a press for pork chops for a long time. When I saw this one I jumped in. For Bacon it's fine, but I would not recomend it for meat, since it's lightweight, if it was a pound heavier it would be a great product for me."
3,It's okay,"The egg rings you must spray down or put something on it. the egg stuck to the inside of the ring...lesson learned. the bacon press is way too short to use on bacon. Im not sure how its suppossed to keep bacon flat if it doesnt even reach the ends of the bacon. However, it is perfect for burgers to keep them flat. I would recommend, but not sure if its really worth it."
2,Egg Rings Stick,"If you are after the egg rings, forget it. Your eggs leave their edges in the rings.As for the bacon press, good grief, how can you mess up a flat piece of iron with a handle?"
5,Absolutely Divine Recording,"Impressive vocals, impressive instrumentals, impressive arragements. I've been meaning to review this album for some time, but I felt that nothing I could write would do this album justice. Read what I have to say, but also listen to the sample clips to get a true sense of Lyamiko's immense talent. This is one of those jazz recordings that's perfect for the jazz enthusiast, the semi-enthusiast, and probably even the non-enthusiast. The tracks are all fantastic. ""Afro Blue"" is a real standout. Other highlights for me are ""Some Other Time"", ""If I Were a Bell"", and ""You'd Be So Nice to Come Home to"", but all of them are truly great. Lyambiko has such a beautiful tone and texture to her voice when she sings, and she uses it just right on each and every track. Check out her final note on the track ""Work Song""; it's pretty powerful. I would jump at the opportunity to see her in concert in a second. This album is an essential."
1,The Contributors Should be Embarassed!,What a miserable collection of pointless and shoddy stories tied together with a preposterous theme. Any military organization that acts like the one used as the basis for these tales deserves to be wiped out in their first hostile contact.
2,A Strange Read,"The Law and the Poor is an odd book. It enumerates some of the ways by which the British legal system into the 1920s either excluded or oppressed the poorer clases. Parry dwells at tedious length with the debacle that was debtors' prison, but has no solution but a belief that time will somehow mediate not only the problem of debtors' prison but all other legal inequities.What Parry expressed (repeatedly) could have been thoroughly covered in about 10 pages. Alas, his book was far longer than that.Only Parry's ability to cite from just about any text written after 1789 makes this book tolerable. I admittedly was amused at the succession of characters Parry inserted into his book. Unfortunately, if you are not extremely well-versed in Victorian history and literature, you'll miss much: Parry draws on the very obscure as often as he does on the famous. For me it was a hoot only because Victorian history is my field.The Kindle download is free; don't waste your money purchasing this book."
5,"Sensible, easy-to-implement tips and strategies","Dan Coughlin's book is serving as a blueprint for helping our company's young leaders hone their individual leadership skills and build stronger, more effective teams. Our creative services director was so impressed with Coughlin's ideas that she's putting together an ""acceleration"" course for her entire team. They will meet weekly and discuss their individual and team progress in implementing Coughlin's easy-to-follow steps for becoming corporate catalysts. I recommend this book without reservations. You might say it's deceptively simple. Sometimes the best ideas are like that. A good investment of your time and money."
4,Good book,"I really liked this book. It was considered my ""textbook"" for a WWII college class. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because I felt like the author went on and on and on and on. It seems like the chapters are neverending and the author used ""big words"" to make the book longer and sound better. Instead of getting to the point, it was filled with unnecessary wording."
2,LIBRARY ITEM,"THE BOOK WAS PAINFULLY SHORT FOR EVEN SOMETHING CALLED A SHORT HISTORY. CONSIDERING THE SCOPE OF EVENTS COMPRISING WW2, THE BOOK WAS LITTLE MORE THAN AN OUTLINE. I EXPECTED MORE AND AM SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTED. FORTUNATELY I HAVE MANY OTHER BOOKS ON THIS PERIOD IN HISTORY."
1,dangerously outdated,This book is based on very old information. It does not represent the current state of practice in genetics/genetic counseling. Anyone reading this book would get a very biased and potentially harmful view of genetic medicine.
4,Waterways World,"I have not received the April, May and June 2009 issues of Waterways World as yet this date May 31, 2009"
5,5 of 5,Two thumbs up great product for the price! recommended to all pistol owners trying to customize a carrying case for themselves.
4,an archive,"SONGS 4 WORSHIP: SHOUT TO THE LORD is an anthology of conventional and well-known songs in the 'Praise and Worship' Genre. The value of this double CD set is its collection of twenty-two old (at least by the conventions of modern worship music) standards in one place.The set does not break new ground. Rather, it presents many favorite musicians doing their signature pieces: the Maranatha Singers, Paul and Rita Baloche, Darlen Zschech, Twila Paris, Delirious?, Amy Grant, Rick Mullins, Graham Kendrick, Keith Green, Pete Sanchez, Jr, Joseph Garlington, Charlie LeBlanc, Ed Gungor, Don Moen, Kent Henry, J. Daniel Smtih, Marty Nystrom, Ron Kenoly, and David Butterbaugh.A good mile marker archive for your library."
5,Songs 4 Worship - Shout to the Lord,"The music is absolutely wonderful. The songs are great for exuberant worship, but the lyrics are so soulful that it has deepened my prayer, as well. I am grateful to all of these artists and thank God for the use of their talents and the opportunity to be blessed by God through them. I liked this CD so much that I bought it for others as gifts. The best money you could spend on music!"
5,Wonderful !,This 2-CD collection of worship songs is really outstanding ! I like that these songs are performed by the original artists in most every case...this is one of the very best ! Enjoy !
4,Pretty good uplifting music,This is pretty good music.You can easily learn the songs if you dont already know them.Keeps you motivated when doing housework.
3,Not the best Panoptica disc,"For me, someone who has almost all the recorded material of Panoptica, this is not the best choice. I was expecting this disc had Panoptica's style mixes from excellent Nortec Collective's tracks, I got a little bit disappointed. Since I've heard most of the tracks mixed in this disc, I got confused about the final result: a non Nortec style set of mixed tracks. There is only one good track, it is called SEM, originally recorded by Latinsizer. It has great beats from its original style and Panoptica gives it a great set of loops and mood. If you expect listening to a great work from Panoptica, consider the disc called Panoptica, this includes tracks from different styles and you'll never get disappointed with this disc."
5,EXQUISITE MOVEMENT! BRILLIANT INSTRUCTION!,"John Loupos has to be one of the best tai chi masters in the country. seriously.read my other reviews. i don't pull punches when it comes to criticism. but this video is truly one of the best instructional DVD's out there. his explanations and corrections are better than any in-person instructor i've ever met. his movements are flawless, and yet not too rigid. he's very thorough and clear as he breaks down the first 17 movements of the yang long form.i only wish that he would make a video of the ENTIRE long form. i have no doubt that it would be the best on the market.people really need to find out about this guy. i'm a qigong instructor in california, and i'm thinking of traveling to the east coast to study with him for a while. he's that good!"
3,It's was ok.,"This was one of the first yoga dvds I purchased when I first started ttc. It looked easy to follow and it had a lower price then some of the other dvds. Though it was easy to follow,it just didn't have as much detailed info as I expected.This would be a great dvd for general excercise, but i just don't think that it had any effect on my fertility at all."
3,not for beginners,"Not for beginners. Breathing techniques are not easy to grasp. Progression of exercises, poses is very quick. Hard to follow when your head is down, and the guide is already on to the next move. However inspires huge respect for majorpregnant ladies who make me look like a sad sack."
1,A CHEAP IMITATION,"Way too commercial. I cannot recommend it. If I could give it zero stars, I would. I would have to say that this is the worst fertility aid ever. It did not help me relax, it was uninspiring and about as unoriginal as it gets. Her voice, the background, the drama are all so distracting and so the opposite of what we should be getting from a fertility yoga session. I feel like she was just going through the motions--no heart. No, this definitely will not help you with fertility...I will have to admit though, it does have a catchy title."
5,This is a great book,I loved this book. When I first started reading it I couldn't put it down and I hardly ever read books! I encourage you to read this book because it is well written and has a great story line.
5,An unforgettable haunting tale with page-turning suspense!,Almost impossible at times to put down! A must read!
3,"yeah, probably the best of hers.","I've read a lot of Phyllis Whitney's books and found all of them boring. But I think this is probably the best. At least, I hesitated before I put the book down to kill a fly. If you haven't read a book of Phyllis Whitney, try this one, or Poiciana is quite good too. Poiciana is very surprising. By the way, Rainbow in the Mist also have a very surprising ending."
5,One of those things a pet owner has to have,"We have a messy set of cats; one tosses his food (and hides it in his fur--what's up with that? A snack for later?) and both of them leave clumps of fur on the chairs. It's a pain to haul out the floor vac and set up the hose, so we just grab a dustbuster instead. The charge keeps going for quite a while, and it's easy to dump out the bag. Also easy to retrieve the cash and small object that get vacuumed up behind the cushions, as the bag is like a cup. I don't see how a pet owner can be without one of these."
4,Pretty Nice Device,"Just got the 9.6 volt model V9610 about a week ago. Overall I like it a lot. It might seem a little large at first, but is handy to use and well balanced. Suction on the high setting is impressive, while the normal setting still provides plenty for most things. Emptying it out is easy, as is cleaning the filter. Be sure to read and understand the instructions for charging it before use. The manual says it'll run 10 minutes between charges. Seems to do better than that to me. It's a lot easier to pull out of the craddle when wall mounted, so I suggest you use the supplied screws and drywall anchors. I took off one star for that and the switch being a little on the stiff side. I definitely recommend this model over the lesser powered ones for the good suction."
5,Don't know WHAT I would do without it !!,"I just LOVE this Dustbuster. I had a previous model by Black & Decker, but this one is MUCH better. PLUS....and this is a BIG plus, you can wash the filters!!! I have two parakeets and use this to clean up seeds and other 'messies' from them. SO....the filters get clogged at times with small seeds, feathers, etc. I just twist them off, separate them, spray some cleaner on them, and wash them very well under a strong blast of hot water with my bath tub faucet....I even use a fingernail brush on the hard plastic one and it cleans out the tiny holes. I just let them dry, and it cleans like it is NEW. It will also go for 3 or 4 days with using it off and on every day without having to put it back on the charger. When/IF this every goes out on me, I WILL buy THIS model again!!"
2,good vacuum - doesn't last long,"The vacuum is good when it's fully charged. Unfortunately, the charge doesn't hold for very long (4 min?). This isn't long enough to clean up even one job (such as a cattail exploding or vacuuming along the edges of the baseboard)."
3,Does the job even though it's falling apart,"Bought it about a year ago. Great for kitty litter, hair and dustbunnies off the bathroom and hardwood floors. Attachments on underside continue to unsnap by themselves and fall off while using the dustbuster. On-off slide button now gets stuck in the ""on"" position and is really hard to turn off. Not strong enough to vacuum the car interior. Fine for minimal daily use aside from falling apart little by little. (My father also bought the same one and has the same problem with the little attachments falling off while using it.)"
5,EZ Lock metal cutoff wheels,"Excellent addition to the Dremel line. These wheels will impress many a skeptic. I think they last even longer than the claimed ""2 X's"" the other fiber glass reinforced wheels."
4,Good idea but not great,"The new EZ Lock mandrel is a good addition to your Dremel accesories, particularly if you use cut-off wheels regularly. It make it somewhat easier to change cut-off wheels, but since the EZ Lock mandrel works with only a few other Dremel accesories, you still have to change mandrels to use your other accessories. The cut-off wheels supplied are heavier duty and seem to last longer than Dremel's previous heavy duty wheels."
4,"cut anything you want, but your tool will pay the price","the wheels work well. the dremel tool, however, is not designed to take the high loads of laterally cutting through tough steel or other materials. after several uses, the bearings on the dremel started to wear and now there is a bit of play. I would recommend using a remote attachment that is easy and cheap to replace to do heavy cutting.the quick release mechanism is easy to use and a solid design... big improvement over the screw type mandrel."
4,Dremel is Expensive but Works Well,I love these tools - the 2-3 times per year when nothing else will do the job!
4,Good product,"nice product, much better system than the black wheels you screw on, they would always break and be a pain to change. I havent broken one of these yet."
5,strong,"works well, I used not even a full disk to cut out all the excess metal in my keys(to reduce pocket weight), which are stainless steel mostly. Also use the fine grit purple attachment for polishing rust off some of the parts under the hood of my car."
4,Great for cats,"Actually got this for my two dogs, but the smaller one got scared the first time the waterer made the bubbling sound, and now he won't even try drinking from it. He's fine with the feeder. The larger dog will occasionally drink from the waterer, but the bubbling also startles her, and she prefers the water bowl I still set out.But the cat loves the waterer. I haven't caught her drinking from the toilet since I got it.The feeder/waterer are both sturdy and attractive, and I would highly recommend it for cats and non-timid dogs."
2,automatic feeder/waterer,"I would not trust this to work when we are away on vacation to feed our cats; the food feeder does not automatically fill the bowl when empty. The lid on the feeder is difficult to remove and put back on, the plastic is cheap and very thin; a low quality product. Also the company makes two sizes, and of course I thought I was getting the larger size and we received the smaller ones. I could not see the size mentioned in the listing for this product."
4,Great after replacement piece,The first time I used the water dish it leaked all over the floor. I contacted the manufacturer and they replaced the tank for free citing a possible pin hole and now it works great. No problems with the food dish.
1,Cheap plastic,I totaly wasted my money on this item. The waterer...tried and tried but could not get threads on the cap to line up and water leaked all over the floor...not once but twice. The plastic is so flimsy the threads strip. In the trash it went.The food feeder is acceptable at best.
3,"Water-er is great, feeder not so much","So I bought this for my cat so I wouldn't have to rely on other people to feed her if I went on a small trip or something. The water-er works great, however the food container not being airtight attracts ants...I came home to the horror of ants all over and in the food...not a fun day...so I would half recommend this product"
1,It leaks water everywhere!,The food bowl works great. The water bowl was not designed well. It overflows every time I fill it up. It just doesn't work! There was water all over my kitchen. Not a good product. And the color is totally different from the picture. I would not recommend this product. I got a super cheap automatic water bowl from Walmart that works perfectly!
3,"Food one works, water one does not",The title says it all. The water tank leaked all over my floor. I made sure to press the plug in as firmly as possible. The water tank wasn't even 100% full. The food one...works? Not sure how a company could screw up a dry food dispenser.
5,Our Dogs love Them!,"We got these to replace our all-in-one feeder and we are very pleased. Our old water dispenser held 2 liters of water so we were constantly re-filling and the food bowl was equally small. We refill the water once a week and the food container once every two weeks, that's great considering we have 3 small dogs. The dogs love the food bowl, their old one wasn't a self feeder so they had to wait on us to refill the old bowl. The hard plastic containers are very well built/designed and will last for many years. Thank you Bergan & Amazon!"
2,Not Informative,"I am planning to vacation in Wyoming this year so I got the video from the library in hopes that it would highlight the various towns we are visiting which happen to be major cities. I wanted to see things to do, places to stay, maybe restaurants. I got nothing from this video. It was filled with more history pertaining to the towns than anything else. Only a few places were hightlighted."
5,Great Protector,I'm a 28 years old softball fastball catcher and I can tell that you won't fell the ball when it hits you it's great and also has lateral protection
4,REALLY ENJOYABLE EASY TO RELATE TO THIS FAMILY,"I AM NOT A MAJOR BOOK READER, BUT DO ENJOY BOOKS LIKE THIS. FOUND IT TO FLOW WELL. LOOKING FORWARD TO MORE FROM THE AUTHOR"
1,GARBAGE,"Wow - the other person who reviewed this wrote ""I have yet to meet someone that likes rock and doesn't like this CD."" Well HELLO - meet the first and certainly not the last. This cd is definitely one of the worst I have ever heard. Out of tune Vocals , Guitar-Playing that's even worse than Kurt Cobain (now THAT'S BAD) and songs that are forgetful and pointless. Where's the hook? This CD is the epitome of what has been wrong with American Rock since 1992 - terrible musicianship and lousy singing. Do yourself a favor and AVOID this pointless waste of time."
4,[...] recommends this book,"This story was about a boy named Leigh and his friend Barry. They find a dog and decide to have joint custody over him. No one believes that they will keep it. Do they keep it? Or does one of them get the dog?I think other kids would enjoy reading this book. Strider starts out ok, but gets really good towards the end. Yes, I would recommend it. The characters were pretty much believable. I think you should read it. My favorite part was the ending - which I'm not going to give away - but I also liked the part when Geneva and Leigh pull weeds together."
3,Strider is a sad and funny book.,Strider is a wonderful book. Strider is about a dog who was adopted by two boys.We didn't like it when Leigh's parents got divorced. Another sad part was when the book said Leigh was poor.It is a funny because Leigh messes up when he writes. The other funny part was when Kevin chases Leigh for a striped and polka dotted shirt.I like the dog Strider because the dog can read words. Another reason the canine is great because it can run fast!
2,Poor Sequel,I thought Dear Mr. Henshaw was great but the sequel was really wrong. The shirt Leigh bought was girly and that's because it was by Beverly Cleary. Sorry Beverly but this is the wrong sequel to Dear Mr. Henshaw
4,strider book review,"The first time that I read strider I didn't like it ,but it was great this time I enjoyed it a lot more. I would totally recommend this book. My two favorite parts in this book were went Leigh the main character invites Geneva to pick weeds with him and Leigh's composition for his english class during the second semester that was only nouns and verbs.The people that I would recommend this book to is anyone that could relate to loving dogs or loving sports."
4,Awesome but deadly book!,I liked this book alot! But some of the details did not make sence.And if you don't read the story very closley you might get lost! But I do recomened it to many readers!
5,What a deal.,I purchased one and like it so much that I immediately purchased two more. It is a great buy for the money. The quality is excellant also.
4,Clamps,This product offered all the varities of clamps needed. They were easy to use and I highly recommend them.
4,Good clamps for the money,I purchased the clamps and have used them for a couple of projects so they have performed well. Well worth the money...
4,Good starter collection for the money,"I recently purchased this clamp set, and for the money, you get a pretty good starter collection of clamps. Quality wise, I was fairly impressed. The metal clamps are powder coated and feel substantial. The plastic clamps have strong springs and very good gripping power. Each clamp has a protective shoe on it to prevent marring of wood projects and the bar clamps have a decent wood handle for tightening down. Overall, this set is quite a bargain and a good place to get your collection started from. If you are a professional woodworker or more than just a weekend warrior, you'll probably want to spend a bit more and get a good set of Bessey's."
3,Columbian Clamps,The problem with these clamps is that the plastic grip clamps break off at the tip with the holding pad of the the 4 clamps in the set 2 have broken both in the first week of use the metals are just fine.
4,Good basic set of clamps.,"Good basic set of clamps, always can use more. I thought this was a great deal but I found the same exact set at Lowe's for ~22 dollars. I still saved a little and I did buy 2 sets. Like I said if you need clamps its still a good value."
1,Slow shipping..!,"I odered it last week, but they sent an email that says estimated shipping date is 1.5 MONTH after!!If you order it as a free super save shipping, you will get it after 2 MONTH!!"
2,Great Clamps,These are great clamps for the price. At a local Woodcrafters store the individual wood clamps were selling for $8-$9 each.I liked these clamps so much that I ordered a second set.
4,Clamps of my dreams,"We haven't used all of them yet (only the plastic ones), but for the price, the set of clamps will be really handy. They came well lubed and ready to go. So far, so good."
1,"Deadly awful stuff, a sacrilege","Please note what I'm writing here applies only to Vol 1 of ""The best of the Hee Haw Gospel Quarter."" I haven't heard Vol 2.Some cretin, with the first volume, decided to add electric guitar and piano to all the cuts, and in the process of doing so, destroyed all the authenticity of what began as masterful renditions of traditional church music.Once upon a time I owned all the HHGQ albums --seems like there were at least six of them-- on cassette, and when they either wore out or were borrowed and never returned I bought Vol one of ""The Best of..."" I've seldom, if ever, been so disappointed in a music purchase. Doesn't deserve any stars at all, but Amazon insists on at least one.I gave the CD to my sister, who is not a particularly discerning listener, and to be honest, she loves it. But if you think Vol 1 of ""The Best of the Hee Haw Gospel Quartet""represents what used to be played on the TV show, you'll be sadly mistaken."
2,Original singers?,"I have heard this CD and am wondering if it is actually the original singers, i.e. Roy Clark, Buck Owens, Grandpa Jones, and Kenny Price? I want to be certain before I buy."
4,captivating,"An inspring movie depicting the possibilities that can happen in modern-day America. Filmed in my hometown of Fullerton, CA this movie captures the hearts of common everyday Americans who just need a good flick to see on a Saturday night. James Earl Jones, as impressive as usual, plays the character of an old retiree living in a convalescent home who inspires the main character ""Bruce Jennings"" to ride a bicycle from Fullerton, CA to Boston, MA in spite of his injuries from a motorcycle accident. I reccomend this movie for high school athletes, and all other ambitious people who are willing to watch a great movie."
5,Dremel wheels,These are very good cut off wheels and I have used them to cut 16 gauge steel and many other metal items in my hobby shop.
3,Tough Stuff! Worth every penny!,"I have been frustrated with standard dremel wheels. When using them on heavier gauge metal type they wear down very quickly or simply fall apart. These wear slowly and have only come apart under the most aggressive, and admittedly, impatient usage. When letting them cut at a reasonable pace, they perform very well.8/6/12Having tried the Gyros brand disks, I have to change my review on these disks. They do hold up better than the cheapest of the cheap, but they still fall apart and wear out pretty quick compared to the Gyros. Sorry Dremel! I need something small to cut heavy sheet metal and these disks don't hold up well for that."
2,Not flamenco,"Having to record this pot-boiler must have felt to Paco and Ramón like Leonardo would have felt had he been forced to paint by numbers.But how you feel about it will depend very much on what sort of music you're looking for.If you want an album of impeccably played Latin (and other) standards, backed by gooey strings, then this will suit you perfectly.If, on the other hand, you're misled by the names of two of the best guitarists of their generation into thinking that this has something to do with Flamenco, then you're in the wrong place.Note the glazed expressions in the photograph, and how Paco can't resist sneaking a bit of alegrías into the introduction of ""Save the Last Dance for Me"", just to relieve the boredom."
4,Makes nice taco shells for taco salads,"The taco shells come out nice and crispy and the cinnamon/sugar recipe suggested on the box is delicious. I wish it had come in a 4-pack set instead of only two, though...gets expensive having to order two sets. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the price which I found a bit excessive considering this is only a pressed metal form that can literally be stamped out for a dime a dozen at the manufactoring plant where they are made."
4,Adjust the baking time for your own taste,"While the instructions indicate an 8 minute baking time, I would strongly suggest that you reduce that time to 5 minutes and then watch the level of browning of the edges. Eight minutes is too much time and causes overdone edges."
1,Did get what ordered,For some reason with no note received multiple tiny boxes of mini pans and no chopper! Was suppose to get two for price of one with chopper! The second was to br a gift! So much for advertising!
2,Too Small,I should have bought the ones I saw at Walgreens! I thought these were going to be larger than the small size. Turns out these were very small. They arrived in about a month as the seller was in China! I would never ever ordered something from China.
4,Easy,These are must-haves if you like to have Taco Salads. The tortillas look so pretty with dip in it. They are non-stick. You do not need to add any oil to the tortilla. This makes the tortilla low fat.
4,Use pie weights,"I love these, except that if you don't use pie weights and stack them, the tortillas puff up."
1,Wrong Size Bowls Received,"The idea behind these bowls were great, however, the size of the bowls are incorrect. I received two bowls 6x6x2, not the size listed and were unable to use for its intended purpose, so I returned them."
5,Great for the money,These are the nicest Tortilla bowls I have seen. Most places only give you one for the price that I paid for the two of these. So to me that is a very good deal. These are not flimsy and a very good size. You wont be sorry ordering these.
3,Product fine but..............,"I was excited to receive my tortilla bowl makers. I made the tortillas and they were disappointing. I did not save my packaging or I would return them. They just did not come out as in good Mexican restaurants. In the restaurants, they are puffy and crisp. Mine were crisp but just flat. The product was as advertized and just fine. The results were not."
4,These do what they advertise,These do exactly as they advertise. Used them recently and they made perfectly shaped tortilla bowls for making a taco salad. Only con is they are not dishwasher safe.
5,Great Compressor,"I usually don't take the time to write reviews as I'm too busy, but this time is different. I ordered this little compressor because my friend had one and loved it. He said he was going around looking for things to nail at his house just so he could use his compressor. I know SENCO is a great brand and being an upholsterer, I have used their staple guns and know they are good. This compressor is light as a feather and can be moved around easily. I drive finishing nails as well as long staples with this little machine. When I first got it I filled it with air and then unplugged it for the weekend. When I came in on Monday morning it was still full and the needle on the gauge had not moved. It held air all weekend. My big compressor just doesn't do that. This little machine is the quietest compressor I have ever heard. It doesn't make you jump every time it switches on. Thumbs up for this tool!"
4,"Light Weight, Quiet","I own a heavy duty Rolair wheelbarrow type compressor for the big jobs, but often I only need to shoot a few finish nails for window trim or other small jobs. The Senco PC1010 is very light, quiet, and just right for the small jobs where I don't want to haul in the big, heavy, loud compressor."
3,Not That Quiet,"My wife ordered this compressor to run her engraving tool for her crafts. We wanted something quieter and smaller than my large compressor so she could handle it and operate it inside the house. This compressor is small and light enough for my wife, but it's not that quiet. Haven't decided yet whether to return it or keep it and enclose it in a box to help muffle the sound."
1,made in tiawan piece of crap,"I owned this compressor for about four years and had nothing but trouble with it. The copper tube between the pump and tank cracked several times, I thought i had it fixed with a longer piece of tubing coiled up to take the vibration then the regulator started leaking now the tank started leaking it has rust holes in it. I will never buy another senco product. I bought a senco cordless nail gun about the same time that i paid $400 for and only drove about a half of a box nails when a cable in it broke and they wanted over $100 to repair it they would not stand behind it. Do not buy senco tools they are made in tiawan or china and do not last very long."
1,I would not recomend it,"I purchased this compressor and I noticed it wouldnt hold its pressure over night. about 6 months later the problem got worse after inspection i noticed it was leaking from one of the welds that held the tank to the frame, right above the foot. I would drain the moisture out of it every time I used it so Im guessing it to be a factory flaw.also the compressor would not drive a 1 inch micro nailflush into a solid stook of wood. Im in the market for another light weight compressor and would not buy this one again"
2,Alas! Good Compressor but it is small.,"I love the compressor. It is a good compressor I can tell. It is well made and operates confidently. Alas, it is small. I use it mainly as blow gun to clean my computer parts. Poosh poosh and the air is gonnnne. I can not clean 1 pc with it. I should have gone with 4-5 gallon tank at least. But then they will be heavy and bulky not usable in my rooms.update:8/27/2010 regulator died leaking air. It doesn't go above 100psi. -2 stars."
2,Strictly for the home owner,"Ya, I agree with most of the one and two star ratings. Great concept but not engineered very well. I thought this was the answer to lugging around my 50 pounder. This thing runs non stop unless you fiddle with the regulator every cycle. Only enough air for a few shots from a trim gun then it starts all over again. I would not recommend this tool. I see Rolair has a new light weight. Think I will check that one out."
5,nifty little trim compressor,"For my applications of easy carry in and out, it's been terrific for lightweight 18ga. finishing.On a small renovation project yesterday, 4 doors jambs and trim were easy (1"" to 2"" 18/16ga brads) The very least of my problems was waiting for the little Senco to catch up. Been using it for about 5 months, shot about 10,000 brads. So far it's been flawless.Very low noise as compressors go, and neat little rubber suction feet that keep it from skidding around and marring up a nice floor."
4,very quiet,This compressor is perfect for my home office. It is very quiet. I use it for airbrushing and it works great. I am a beginner and I think some one more experienced would prefer a larger compressor. But for portablility you cannot beat this. And it is very quiet
4,"Works well, a bit loud.","A dB rating was never provided for this, but it was listed as extremely quiet, so I bought it for a home electronics lab. It's a bit loud probably in the 80 dB range so late night tinkering is done with it off."
3,A nice little machine,"The senco pc1010 1-horsepower peak 1-gallon compressor is nice and light weight easy to move around, very quite & has plenty of power for my trim jobs. I am a finish carpenter and I am using a range of finish guns that shoot a 16 to 23 gauge nail, & it completes the job. I would not use it on any large trim jobs where I would be trimming a whole house. I would use it to trim out a room, kitchen or while building a fireplace mantle."
5,Very Quiet!,My treadmil is way louder than this thing. I use this to blow air out of computers and other electronics. Refills fast for short bursts of high powered air. Easy to move around and looks sexy!
3,OK,"I had 2 of these now and they work flawlessly until the motor goes out, at that point you just buy a new one.Wish they lasted longer, not alot of hours before they go."
5,the # 1 compressor in my book,i ordered this compressor because i do alot of airbrushing/body art and i needed one that would hold up to my standards. (AND THAT IT DID) this compressor is very quiet and lightweight. holds enough air to do everything i need it to do!!!!!! and then some!!!!!! if you are looking for a #1 compressor you have just found it....
4,Great little compressor,"Don't put to much stock in the negative reviews about this compressor. It does exactly what it is designed to do. It's not made to shoot framing nails on after the other. But it will shoot brads and finish nails all day long. Just use some common sense when buying this item. Know before hand what you intend to use it for. Love the light weight especially after my back surgery. This is just what the doctor ordered. Ha ha, I just cracked myself up."
5,Great for interior work,Saw this on toolselect.com and agree it is a great little compressor. I used this compressor to install trim and drive finish nails and it worked without issues so far. very easy to carry one handed around the house and also fairly quiet. would buy again.
3,Depends how you use it.,"A friend got this a few years back along with the pin nailer. I've never used the pin nailer with the compressor......but i'm the compressor can handle the tiny gun. the thing is though, i've used the compressor for cleaning off some materials, and it's 1 gal. tank can't handle the constant air flow of the blow gun. So if you're buying this for pin and brad nailer use, go for it, but other than that, it's too small to be useful."
2,Senco is a good Brand but as always remember to test 1st...,"I have used these air compressors before and have always liked them especially because of their weight. I mad the mistake of not testing it before I moved to Brazil (arrived last minute while loading container) PROBLEM! Auto shut off doesnt function, tank fills and releases air over and over until it smokes!!! Now I have to find somebody who works on compressors, and pray they can find the parts if needed (or gum and sticks). WEll good luck buyers, most of you have the option of returning it!!"
2,I'm not sure why you would want this,"This air compressor was a lot more bark than it's bite. It took forever to finally fill the tank and it didn't even top off my car tires. I wanted a little, reliable, well-built air compressor for basically that--topping off my tires. I returned this and went to Sears to buy a Craftsman. It's a little bigger, but less expensive; and it works more quickly.Thank you, Amazon for making purchases and returns relatively easy."
2,Not Powerful enough,I purchased this air compressor to clean where I can't use water. It only gives you one short burst before it has to recompress the air. It is not very powerful at all. We ended up getting a larger one.
5,The Secert School,"I read The Secret School with one of my classmates and the schools aide. We loved it!The story is about a girl named Ida she and her classmates found out that their teacher's mother is sick. The teacher has to go and take care of her.The classmates vote for Ida to be their teacher, but there is one catch Mr.Jordan the head of the school can't find out!I would recommend it to every kid in the world, because every kid likes a secret!"
4,Shh It's a Secret!!!! /By:AJY (Grade5),"A quiet day in 1925, Ida Bidson and her classmates heard the terrible news. Her teacher had to go take care of her. Mr Jordon was closing the school down for good!!!! Ida felt like tearing every strand of hair out of her head because the exams for high-school was soon what should she do. All of a sudden Tom her best friend had a excellent idea but the idea had to be kept a secret.I thought this book had great use of vocabulary and I never wanted to put it down. I reccomend this book for 4-6 grade girls and boys. Avi did it AGAIN!!!!!!"
2,Blah,"I've gotta say, I was really disappointed with this book.Maybe it's because I have more than a few expectations when I sit down with an Avi book: an element of mystery, an intriguing plot, compelling characters. I found none of these in The Secret School. Overall, I didn't feel connected with the characters, the writing was noticably more bland than Avi's typical style, and the plot, while interesting in its premise, didn't run very deep. Don't get me wrong -- I love historical fiction, and I love Avi, but I don't think The Secret School lives up to the best of what Avi is capable of.For a more satisfying Avi treat, dig into his most recent book: Crispin The Cross of Lead."
4,A slow-paced book with good character development,"14-year-old Ida wants to be a school teacher, and she undertakes the temporary task of being the schoolmarm for her entire town when the teacher unexpectedly leaves. Without finishing the year, she can not be accepted into high school, so she and the other students make a secret agreement to continue having school with Ida as the teacher.This book shows the pull between desire and duty. It's a good book for characters and giving personality insights... but not much action takes place. The non-standard English makes this fun to read out loud. The children drive their parents' old jalopy to school -- that's fun.We liked this book as a family. The family relationships within the book are very strong. Ida's friend Tom is a great boy character -- clever, inventive, lght-hearted and well-meaning."
2,"interesting. Nope, just dull...",It was an okay book. But I think the characters were dull. I wasn't a big fan and I wouldn't suggest reading it
4,The Secret School--Awsome!,I read The Secret School with one of my classmates and the school's aide.I would recommend it to other people.I thought that this book was stupendious and tramendious!I would recommend this book to a friend.I think that the other people would think the same thing of The Secret School as I did.I hope that other people would enjoy it.
5,it was !GREAT!,i want to be a teacher when i grow up and i really liked this book beacause Ida Bidson is just like me exept older. i look up to her and i enjoyed this book i would recomend it to another peer of my age who likes adventure and who likes the authour AVIi hope AVI will write a sequil to this book.
4,This Book Should Not Be Kept a Secret!,"The Secret School By: AviUnlike this school, this book should not be kept a secret. This is the story of a young ambitious girl named Ida. She has this crazy idea to start a secret school because her old teacher left. Ida has to face the problem of teaching herself, as well as her peers at the same time. Ida learns to deal with her problems and live life to its fullest! Critic: Maggie"
3,"Read it, why not?","This book is an ok book. If you are interested in a short book with a sweet little story, this is the book. There isn't much action, and the action that there actually is, is very little. I would recomend this book for a fifth grade book report. This book isn't very interesting, but it's cute. In a lot of the chapters is the same thing over and over again. Read it, why not?"
3,Rachels Secret School,Ida Bidson is only fourteen. I liked this book because some of the parts were exciting like when Ida Bidson got mud and water all over her. How it happened is she was the teacher and the children were outside. They were throwing stones in the water. Then Ida fell into the water and mud. Some parts were sad like when Ida almost kicked Herbert out of the school because Herbert was yelling at Ida and then got really mad. Then Ida almost kicked Herbert out of the school. At the end Ida fell in love with Tom. Tom was her age and she taught him. This story was set in 1925.
2,"One problem, one nuisance.","I purchased this phone based on it's reviews and price. I probably wouldn't get it again.My two complaints are that I occasionally hear my voice as feedback through the speaker. I have not been able to narrow down what causes this and has been only a nuisance as a user.The most pressing issue is that the people I am talking to tell report that I am ""breaking up"". This has occurred while speaking to different users on different phone lines. This does not occur with an older phone that I used to troubleshoot the problem. Thus the ""breaking up"" is inherent to this Uniden. Therefore, I have reverted to using my cell phone as opposed to playing the ""Can you hear me now?"" game with my home phone."
1,Bad Phones,"These phones are terrible. Sound quality very bad, if you walk more then 10 feet from the base you lose your connection."
2,Uniden-4 phones,We are disappointed. The instructions to program names and numbers is very difficult and unclear. We could not do it. The sound on one of the extentions is somewhat distorted. We have kept it because I destroyed the box and it is to much trouble to send it back.I do not want my legal signiture available to the internet.R. Menetrey
5,Malco TS1 Turbo Shears,"Received in Australia 7 days before original delivery date, very well manufactured shears heavy duty construction, pleased with shears and excellent delivery time.Arrived before my sons Birthday, he is a sheet metal worker, it will be a great addition to his tool kit."
5,Excellent time saver,As an Hvac install tech this tool cuts through furnace cabinets like butter in a 1/4 of the time it'd take me to hand cut the cabinet. Excellent buy for the money. Dont know why I waited so long to buy one
1,Save your money for a better tool,"I tried the cutter on 20-gauge and lighter aluminum. I should have heeded the earlier reviews. I can't see any way to make this tool work with any precision. The single blade action tends to bend the metal and leave marks on cut edges. The cutter is less expensive than two-bladed models, but, at $41+, it is still a substantial investment. For my limited job to fabricate two 10-ft sections of flashing and a 12-ft gutter, I did much better with conventional tin snips for angled cuts and a heavy duty box cutter for straight sections. If you regularly cut a large amount of metal, I recommend spending the necessary amount for a more precise, two-bladed cutting attachment. Otherwise, you will waste the purchase price on the TS1 and waste time and money throwing away poorly cut pieces of sheet metal. A better designed tool would also be safer than the TS1, as the cutter will be less likely to bind and suddenly twist the metal."
3,Won't cut 5V Crimp,I bought this for cutting 5V crimp roofing. It does great on flat panels but can't make it over the crimps. Oh well.
4,User friendly,"This cutter works as good or better than most electric type cutters I have purchaced. One side of the cut scars the metal though, which is ok because I only use it for cuts in which the metal will be covered by trim pieces. It also is fairly easy over high ribs partly because you can rotate your drill left or right. Well worth the priceT Smith"
2,Microsoft Picture It 2000,I get way too many errors with this product. The debug feature doesn't work. I am very frustrated with this product because I loved the earlier version that I had for several years. The XP version falls far short.
3,Hayward Hits The Bottle,"Susan Hayward pulls out all the stops in this story of a woman who sinks into alcoholism. Her husband, Lee Bowman, gives her everything she could want, but in doing so, takes away her self-respect and identity. This seems to be a female version of The Lost Weekend (made a few years earlier), although it's definitely more melodramatic. Hayward gets to run the range of emotions and does so to great effect, including a catfight with Marsha Hunt, who is excellent as Bowman's controlled assistant and suspected mistress. The movie attempts to take a serious look at alcoholism, but that takes a backseat to the soap opera elements in the story. There's nothing really new here now, but this story must have had more bite when it was first released. Hayward's strong performance makes it watchable, and it is interesting to view an early attempt at explaining the psychology behind this disease."
3,Excellent & informative,"This is a beautiffuly illustrated book, small enough for a child to carry around and my ""squidling"" does. Very factual."
2,too expensive,"If you HAVE to have it, fine. If not, don't waste the money. I had to buy it as a replacement to a much loved Woody that got lost. Cute and Cuddly, but not worth half the price. Look for cheaper!"
2,Not accurate...,"The movie quality is great and the story is cute, but its' not biblically accurate. In this story Jonah has a little hermit crab who travels with him and is constantly trying to get him to obey the Lord, which is of course not in the real story, lol."
5,Air Bud Spikes Back,loved it!! They have watched a few times. My kids love the movies with talking animals. They will get future air bud movies
3,good but not great book,a good read for people interested in this subject. the author indulges too much in selfconciousness and newagespeak. this book could be edited to half it's size and be a much better work.
1,On the bandwagon,"I too should write a book like this and jump on the fantasy bandwagon. I know as much as Ken does about Castaneda, his book is a rehash of the Castaneda books and says nothing new. Why pretend you knew Don Juan. The book is full of ego and self importance and is completely opposite to the teachings of Don Juan.Ken, you're supposed to lose self importance not inflate your ego even more."
3,Find a Context First,"Ken Eagle Feather deserves credit for compiling a summary on the Toltec Teachings (of Carlos Castaneda).His focus on practical application is appreciated.What the book does not do is to help build a CONTEXT.Techniques are to help one down a path, at which point one has a level of clarity about what the path is for, why one is on the path, and the possible results, choices, etc.Castaneda himself provided a context that is sketchy in parts, allowing for a wide range of reader interpretations. With a context like that provided inShadows in the Twilight: Conversations with a Shaman, readers may find this book more helpful."
1,Read This with a Grain of Salt,"This guy is very imaginative about his relationship with ""Don Juan"" and frankly should be sued. He does not know what he is talking about. The book is full of new age blar blar and if you want to live a fanasy world then enjoy, other wise skip it."
3,A slow but exciting mystery,"In the novel Amnesia, the Protagonist Dr. Peter Zak works in the Neuropsychiatric Unit. Life for him consists of work and rowing in the Charles, in his last gift from his wife Kate. This being the only thing that could keep him from playing back those chilling images of Kate's death. He had long since stopped working as a forensic scientist until one call from an old friend drew him back in. A very intriguing case had come up, seems a women was shot in the head, and left to die, spent weeks in a coma, only to wake up and remember the killer. Dr. Zak's job could she really remember who the killer was after being shot in the head and going into a coma? This book was a very good mystery novel. I myself enjoyed reading it but found that I came to be inpatient because of the time it took to really unravel the mystery. I found that the action just doesn't really come soon enough for me personally, but when it did it was hard to stop reading."
3,A Book You Won't Forget Reading!,"This was a pretty entertaining mystery. The psychology angle made it quite interesting and gave it an added element over the standard mystery. But the characters, overall, lacked that certain sparkle to be the first book in a series that I am desperate to continue reading. I will say that for it being written by two authors, it was remarkably cohesive. The ending was not a complete surprise, but it was exciting."
1,WHO EVER SAID THE CARTERS WERE TALENTED????!!!!!,I first heard this song on the radio and thought it was Aaron Carter singing it. Their voices sound exactly the same. And by the way who ever said the Carters were talented. The only reason they got a record deal is because of 1.Thier big brother is NICK CARTER and 2.They're good looking. Do me a favor people don't buy this single. If u like that song just record it from the radio.
2,uh no,"i had never listened to this song before i bought this single, but i thought what would it hurt. I mean i love Nick Carters voice, and Aaron sounds just like him when he was young, so i took a shot. Well i'm sorry i did, i mean maybe she isn't all that bad, but if your like me and have listened to the backstreet boys since they were new, then you might be upset. She brings nothing new to the whole pop scence and she sounds like her brothers!!!"
1,The Carter family Needs More Career Ideas,"This is the worst single I've heard in YEARS! There's something seriously wrong with the genetics in this family. Leslie sounds like a boy and Nick and Aaron both sound like girls. The songs are so bad and overdone here, the vocals are so enhanced and the feeling is missing from every lyric so much that this shouldn't even qualify as music. It's a good thing Nick and Aaron are cute, they'll always have tons of crazed teeny bopper girls chasing after them, Leslie, on the other hand is going absolutely nowhere."
3,Sounds Different.,"I like the title track, but True is something I just could not listen to. Buy it for the sticker, if it's included on the internet, and the title track. I'd say it's an intermediate buy. Hey, she's better than her little brother, a wanna-be Nick."
1,IS THERE NO GOD??,"First, there was nick carter, forever polluting the music business. Then came aaron, who delivered a crippling blow. This is the final nail in the coffin of good music. This is the worst piece of trash ever to come out of the sewer that is the music industry. How can this girl live with herself? She sings worse than her brother aaron ( worse than nails across a blackboard) and put out the ugliest music video since the days of Michal Jackson. The Carter parents should be shot. If one more Carter sibling records something, I will kill myself."
2,"Bland,upbeat,but all the same...","I know Leslie Carter has talent somewhere,but she sure as heck doesn't show it on her debut single ""Like Wow"" or the B side ""True"" in fact me and my friend quite frankly agree that she sounds like her brother Aaron when she sings the song ""True"" just listen to Aaron then Leslie and you'll see what I mean... I'm a bit sick of this manufactured pop myself,but don't count Lelie out because her debut album may not turn out awesome or even good,but she'll have her chance to shine in the future I know it whether she writes her songs or not,its the music that matters not who writes it..."
5,LESLIE IS TOTALLY LIKE WOW!,"I think Like wow is an AWESOME SONG! Leslie is my FAVOURITE female singer, I love her music, style, originality and creativity! Leslie has an AMAZING voice, which you will definitley notice when you listen to her music! The 2nd song featured on this single is called ""True"" and it is soooooooooo WICKED! Her SEXY brother Nick wrote it!!! He did an AWESOME JOB AS ALWAYS, Leslie did an AWESOME JOB singing it too AS ALWAYS!!!Definitley two of the BEST SONGS you will EVER HEAR! :)"
3,On the Way to 'Wow',"Leslie Carter has a promising career ahead. 'Like,Wow' is an upbeat and catchy tune suitable for young children and teens. It's refreshing to see a young girl who simply shows off her talent and not her sexuality. Which one might like to know how a female could have any at fourteen years of age. But the song doesn't showcase this young woman's maxium ability. That will be left to hear in the second song 'True' another song fit for younger listeners. The teen does have a delightful voice. Whether there's some magical in the Carter Family or not-there is a possibilty that the female Carter could make some magic of her own with time and maturity."
3,"""True"" sounds like her little brother...","I was sure that Leslie would be a short-lived pop ""diva"", and my assumption may be correct. ""Like, Wow"" was actually pretty good. Her voice is very pretty in this song, and despite the horrendously flaky title, it's fun to listen to. But as for ""True""...it's just terrible. The lyrics are shallow (""my friends tell me I love you"" what's up with that??) , she sings it mechanically, and her voice sounds awful! She sounds like Aaron did when he started, which is like a chipmunk. ""True"" was unbearable, I couldn't even listen to it the whole way through. It's because of ""True""'s god-awfulness that I gave this three stars. I don't know why her voice sounded better in ""Like, Wow"" than in ""True"", but I'm seeing reasons as to why she hasn't become as popular as her brothers."
1,"No, no, no!","Young writers should NEVER write novels about novelists writing a novel and the difficulties they encounter and Art and Truth and Compromise and Aesthetics and...well, you get the idea. Mr. Dee is an excellent writer. His later works, especially Palladio and The Liberty Campaign, are excellent and enjoyable. Write this one off as a youthful indiscretion that had to be gotten out of his system, and under no circumstances buy or attempt to read it."
4,Easy Homemade Ravioli,"I bought a pasta machine and thought that making my own ravioli would be fun too. After reading reviews about the ravioli makers that come with some of the pasta machines I decided on this product. Since it was simpler to use, it seemed like it would not have the same issues with filling falling out or having empty ravioli like the machine kind. It turned out to be true. Whether you spread it across both sheets of pasta evenly or try to measure out where each ravioli will fall (obviously the first way is so much easier) you will end up with a lot of good ravioli. The only thing I would change is the width of the rolling pin- if you're using a pasta machine to get your pasta sheets thin and even it won't even be half as wide as the pin. This makes for some difficult maneuvering. Other than that though, I haven't seen an easier method yet. And making them myself was very fun."
1,Totally inappropriate!,"Like the other reviewers, this movie was on our Benji DVD. So, I thought nothing of putting it on for my 5 year old. Big mistake. She's still crying as I write this and after watching the first ten minutes to see what the deal is, I turned it off (racial epithets, drugs, probation and prison all in that short time). Note to self and others, just because it comes with Benji don't assume it is OK for children."
3,The movie trailer is a bit misleading.,"I wasn't sure what I was expecting with this movie, but it sure wasn't what I thought it would be.Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie but it is pretty much two movies.In the first part, ""Tommy"" has some of the best lines that I've ever heard. The second part of the movie is just plain depressing."
4,"Don't Miss This ""Trip""","This was a very enjoyable movie. The lines were very funny and Jill St. John (Mary) was hysterical. Allen's stutter in the early part of the movie was a bit annoying, but overall he performed well in the role. The historical clips gave the movie a time line and I loved the period music. If I had one dislike, it was the stereo typical Mexican character that seems to be very outdated."
4,worth the trip,"one of my favorites, seen originally at a film festival. Alexis Arquette is hilarious as the roommate and there is the special appearance of Jill St. John (somebody must have known somebody). Still, it is funny and poignant and production values are very good, which sometimes is not the case with these independent gay features."
1,Shockingly Boring!,"My partner & I bought this Movie as we believed the reviews that we read online. what a mistake. Bad dialogue, uninteresting chararacters, and even worse wigs! The only good thing about this film was Jill St John. She was a hoot. be warned this movie is crap! I made myself watch this till the end just in case it got better. Will never watch it again."
2,"Trying high, but reaching poor","I purchased ""The Trip"" based on a trailer on another TLS release. The trailer let me belived the movie might be much better. Although a low budget movie, which is fine, I found the cript lacking some real material. Cliches, after cliches, it seems that the writer has not seen any other movies in ages. Give us soemthing new.The acting is average. I also regret the fact that the movie is shown is full screen, instead of letterbox.I would pass this one, of watch it well advise that this might dissapoint you."
2,I thought it was corny and boring.... not a bad end though.,"Look, the cover was great but once I turned this dvd on those 70s wigs were so bad (fake) that I couldn't concentrate on much else, except perhaps the bad acting from Larry Sullivan and that awful voice.... masculine not. Body, yeah pretty good.Some nice footage in the film from seventies rallies. Some funny lines too, nothing side splitting though.The end is kind of good though, not least because the actors take off those bad wigs but also because there's the first genuine display of synergy between these two blokes.The film is corny and the actors are not convincing lovers, until the end. You won't be doing cartwheels over this one mate."
4,Poignant,"Being a woman, I don't know what the guys think of this movie, but I liked it. I wish the two lovers could have stayed together forever, but they were with each other in the end. And the main protag found his inner strength. The acting was pretty good too. It even had some faces in it that I recognized from the mainstream."
4,"Shadowed with ""family values""","An epic romance film depicting a blossoming 20th century sex-liberation in 1973-middle eighties, this sometimes mixing info story is of friendship and relations between two young Americans, an open gay activist and influential daddy's son-journalist born into success.Probably, timing itself grounds more recently a broad public acknowledgement with and viewing of ""Bareback Mountain"" disappeared from Amazon to date as this movie is unreasonably still shadowed with ""family values"" speculations."
1,I didn't like it.,"I was excited when this movie showed up in the mail and immediately put it in my DVD player and sat down to watch. It didn't take long for me to realize it was a cheaply made film. The story was interesting and had it been done in a better way, the film could have been great but after having seen movies such as Trick and Latter Days where the acting and production quality were very good, I found myself feeling dissapointed after only a few moments. It is not a movie I would readily recommend."
1,Derivative Drivel,"Like others below, I got this movie based on the many positive reviews. It wasn't even CLOSE to good, and it left me feeling ashamed for gay cinema that something like this garners high praise. Then again, if your only experience of gay culture is ""Queer Eye for the Straight Guy,"" maybe this is your cup of tea. The movie doesn't seem to know what it wants to be, and end up a jumble of so many other films and themes that just don't connect (and what a ripoff of Greg Araki's work...not to mention the glaringly obvious yet meaningless Thelma and Louise nods). Character motivation doesn't make any sense; there are obviously scenes left out; and most of the writing is merely two characters discussing what has happened in their lives (far be it from the moviemaker to actually SHOW us some of these pivotal and probably far more interesting scenes). All in all, a dismal disappointment. If you want to see what great gay cinema is all about, get BIG EDEN, which is a far superior film."
3,Good until the last act,The movie tells the story of two men who fall in love and the movie follows them through 3 different times in their lives. I loved the the two leads and the chemistry between them was wonderful. The dialogue was well written but during the third act the film derails into the typical dramatic gay movie clichés and tragegy that become all too predictable. That's when I stopped enjoying it. If it hadnt taken this turn I would have given it a much higher rating.
5,Never have i seen a movie so romantic with two men,"This movie is like in another review stated pure gold. Its funny, romantic, serious, and has some action. The story is very well written and director and you cant help but fall in love with Tommy. Im constantly searching for movies that revole mainly around gay men. There have been some disappointments, but this film cannot ever disappoint anyone. If you really enjoy gay movies dont hesitate to buy this film. You wont be let down."
5,A True Love Story,This movie is something I will never forget. It has connected with me and my whole life. Watch this movie please. For me. You won't regret it. I also agree that this movie is about my own eternal love story. Can't stand that Peter guy.
5,The Trip of a lifetime!!!!,"I love this film!!!!!!!!!!!! Not all of the acting was great but it was a beautiful film. Sad, funny, political, compassionate!!!!!!! Larry Sullivan is great in this film in every way!!!! One of my favorite gay themed films ever!!!! Buy this dvd!!!!!!!!!! It is a MUST in your collection!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,EXCELLENT film!,"I don't know what the reviewer ""Gordon Larko"" is smoking. For some eason, he feels compelled to leave the EXACT SAME horrible review and 1 STAR rating for all GAY-THEMED movies. Probably a ""personal problem"" of his. Hopefully this review will help correct this imbalance. I can't believe AMAZON is allowing this GAY BASHER to use their website as a venue to spread his hate.By the way, This is an absolutely WONDERFUL movie!"
2,The Trip trips,"It's too bad. There was enough talent in front of the camera to produce a decent film. The two main actors are appealing, and they are backed up by some solid character actors, who seem to be having fun. But the script is just not very good, and the direction could have been better.The central relationship, thanks to the depth invested in it by the two leads, holds the attention, but the script doesn't know what to do with it. Everything seems contrived, and nothing seems real. The supposed climax of the film, the trip itself, is aimless and doesn't give any emotional payoff.A missed opportunity."
3,"Romantic and funny, but save the Tissues","In preparation for this movie, I was warned to have the Tissues ready. Boy, was I disappointed. As ""tear jerkers"" go, The Trip leaves a lot to be desired. That aside, the first half of the movie is a delightfully humorous look at gay life in the early 70's. Don't get too attached to the characters, as the ending is almost too predictable."
2,Not Bad,"I don't want to give the impression that this was a bad movie, because it wasn't. I do, however, want to say that I do not think that it is deserving of all the praise it has recieved. The character development was rather poor, and the plot was threadbare, but it did provide some enjoyment. It was light, and full of laughter, and obviously did not take itself too serriously. I would recomend renting or watching this movie on pay-per-view before purchasing it. The major complaint I have with this movie is that it did not build the relationshi between the characters, and it is impossible to understand some of the actions done by the characters without some type of development. I think there was potential there, but not a lot of follow through. More like a last minute effort at throwing things together. All in all I think it's not a horrible movie, but it isn't worth having in a collection."
3,It was average,"In some ways it had a good story line, it did have a meaning. It seems the aids virus has been done in every story line and in every fashion. I am personally tired of it. There was some very good scenery and some comical moments. All the characters did work good together though. It is not a movie to pay full price for, although it is decent but not exceptional."
2,The Trip,"I'm a big fan of gay love stories, but this one, although it starts off with great promise, is the victim of a low budget. The acting is pretty good--Larry Sullivan is particularly good. The movie is far too short to emcompass the scope of what the film sets out to accomplish, which is an epic of gay life and the way two men see themselves through the turbulent early 70's till the mid-80s."
2,A Little Disappointing,"I was disappointed in this film which felt forced and artificial. The leads are great and fun, and the story isn't too bad, but the execution of the movie made me feel like I was watching a gay ""That 70's Show."" I wasn't sure whether to laugh or not. The last third of the movie becomes a scorching ""Thelma and Louise"" road trip which doesn't feel authentic either. I'm all for artistic license, but the whole thing wasn't very believable and not that interesting, either. Okay overall, but not great."
5,Listen to me,I know you like this movie. Be my Alan. I can feel you. I saw your picture. You look good and so sweet. I am going crazy. Baba wants us to be together.
1,Don't Bother,"I have no clue what kind of acid trip the previous reviewers were on, but this is anything but a good movie. Bad acting, terrible wigs & costumes & a totally unbelieveable plot all point to a very bad movie. Don't waste your money."
1,The Trip,I did not like this movie because there were no love scenes (sex) between the the two main chracters.
5,Great Movie,"It is about time a good comedy was made about the evolvement of gay movement over the past 25 or so years....It keeps you laughing, but also makes you a bit somber...It also makes you realize how things have changed during the past years....I especially liked the ridiculous characters who were ignorant about the gay lifestyle, because it pokes fun at the blind hypocrites...and some footage of actual televised events that were broadcast to the public..Buy it, you will like it"
5,Great gay movie,My boyfriend brought this home the other day. We had been arguing. After the movie was over I just leaned over and kissed him. We eventually made up. So much of life is just bull crap and we need to seize the moment before it is too late. The reviewer is right about how this movie can have that effect on you.From the actors to the plot to the music we really enjoyed this movie.
5,I recommend taking this trip...,"I was really surprised by this movie. The selection of each actor was done extremely well and each added to the quality of this film. After watching the movie, I was stunned for a good hour just thinking back to my first experience, the emotions I had, remembering the struggles of that time for gay people. I watched the movie again because I was so engrossed in it the first time, I knew I must have missed something - and I was right. This movie honestly made me laugh and, at the end, cry. It is rare that a movie, and the actors of that movie, can pull a viewer in so easily and make them feel like they are seeing the events first hand. I think this movie was one such film. I would highly recommend purchasing (or at least renting) this film and experience it for yourself!"
3,Tries too hard... and sometimes that is enough...,"This movie has a great premise, but the scope is so large and wide that no depth is ever achieved. There are some solid performances (the leads) and some cheesy ones (Alexis Arquette & Jill St John). There is a truly amazing soundtrack. There is that sense of deja-vu all over again as you recall where you were in your life during the various episodes of the film.Because the scope is so big, and the time frame so long, there are large gaps in the story and the development of the characters. This means I lost my investment in them. Watching the deleted scenes on the disc helped fill in a bit, and the behind the scenes film also helped. But, without having seen those, the closing left me feeling preached at.I was a bit disappointed after reading so many positive reviews. I am not saying 'don't watch it;' just 'don't have too high of expectations.' At the same time, I hope to see other films from this director. There is some real promise there."
5,Rapid hose reel,I have had this hose reel for a couple of years. I built a bracket on the wall to hang the hose reel. When I need the hose I unwind it off the reel on the wall. When I'm done I just crank it back up and its away. If I need to take it somewhere it's ready to go. It's a lot easier to use the reel than to coil the hose up by hand. It's also a lot easier to unreel the hose than untangle a coiled mess.
3,Handy but fragile,This tool worked very well but the frame is too fragile. It broke soon after I bought it. I love the handiness and lightness of it but the thin frame bar that you see in the picture doesn't seem to last. I still use it but it climbs over straight edges that I clamp to plywood to make even cuts. The thin kerf blade and the power pack make this thing run all day but make sure you have a spare battery around just in case.Rob
4,Not bad,I am a fan of Pete Fountain. Wonderful clarinetist. Some good selections from this CD. Not your usual Dixieland which I am NOT a fan of. Worth the buy.
4,"The ""scoop"" on the scoop!","Works fine. Releases just as it says it will. Not quite as sturdy as I thought it would be, but time will tell if it will hold up."
1,Horrible look after cleaning,"As the other reviewers have noted, after using it once, the color of this scoop turns extremely unappealing and disgusting. Touching the scoop is reminscent to me of fingernails across a chalkboard. Not recommended."
1,Ice cream scoop,"I am not sure that the ice cream scoop that our daughter gave to us about 2-3 years ago is the same but I wanted to share with you. The mechanism works well but I was serving sherbet the other day to guests and the coating on the aluminum or metal came off as a gray color on the sherbet. The patent no. on our is No. 4. 721. 449 and further has the wording - NSF Buildit Engineering Co. #A25 Burbank, California USA. Thought you should know about this as other may be experiencing some of the same situation.Thank you,Sidne Fuller1831 E Mason lake Dr. EastGrapeview, Wa. 98546"
3,BASKIN ROBBINS SCOOPER,I PURCHASED 4 TO START LIKED THE WAY IT WORKED ORDERED 25 MORE HOWEVER I AM CONCERNED AND WILL TRY TO GET IN TOUCH WITH MANUFACTURER SO FAR 1 OUT OF THE 4 HAS ALREADY BROKEN ACTUALLY SPLIT IN HALF I HOPE THIS WAS A DEFECTIVE ONE AND THE REST R O K I KNOW THEY HAVE A 5 YEAR WARRANTY I NEED HELP IN FINDING OUT HOW TO RETURN FOR EXCHANGE
2,"Here's the ""scoop""","From the description of this ice cream scoop, I thought it would be great, but I was disappointed. I would never buy another one."
2,close but not the same scoop used in stores,"As a former Baskin Robbins owner for 20 years I can attest to the fact that this is NOT the scoop used in BR stores. Our 25+ year old scoops are still bright and shiny-- and solid stainless steel, very heavy. Also, there is no name inscribed in the actual scoops. The newer ""real"" scoops used today have a serrated edge. But the operation of the scoop can't be beat-it is the best designed scoop there is. But this resale item is merely a cheaper version of the real thing (which currently costs over $25 from the only approved smallwares supplier BR has and can only sell to BR stores!)"
1,hard to clean,"I thought it was stainless steel and after a trip through the dishwasher it looks just awful....like splotchy discolored zinc. I hope it's safe to be in contact with food but it looks very unappealing. Also, you must have VERY STRONG FINGERS to remove and then reinstall the push-button spring in order to clean it properly. It's a good design idea but needs to be better made."
2,Not dishwasher safe,"I am not positive but I thought this was dishwasher safe. I used the item once and put it in the dishwasher. That was a no-no, it turned black and so did anything that it touched. Prior to that, it worked fine. Now I don't want to use it at all."
3,too short and boring pictures,Didn't like the artwork at all (kids were bored by the pictures). Short book. Most appropriate for 2 year olds. Wouldn't recommend for children over 2.
1,"No strap, too tight","Poor product. No strap comes with this case. Too difficult to get the iPod out for updates, whilst trying to pull out iPod can be dropped. Front view cover is smeary and scratched. Buttons are difficult to re-snap. No need for other voting on this --just a poor product."
1,"THAT'S SCREW UP,SAME PERSON 5 REVIEWS","Not fear to honest buyers to have this same person(using like ""hispanic names"") giving 5+ reviews all w/5 stars, I wonder if she/he is making any money by doing this .... OH WELL STUPID PEOPLE EXIST IN THE WORLD !!!"
2,Retroville Christmas,"The kids of Retroville debate Santa's existence at show and tell in school one day. Jimmy concludes that Santa doesn't exist, based on his mathematical calculations. His friends won't believe him, so he takes them off to the North Pole so they can see for themselves. At the North Pole they meet ""diminutive helpers"" and scramble Santa's DNA, almost ruining Christmas for everyone around the world. But with some cooperative work between Jimmy and Santa Claus, they manage to pull off Christmas once again. The book is not scary, but it's probably not appropriate for youngsters who are still firm believers in Santa Claus. It has about 1450 words."
5,"Songs of Romance, Vol. 1",If you love to listen to the pan flute than this is CD is a must. I just love it.
5,This is awesome flow yoga,"The people who are saying it's not yoga must be unaware of this style of yoga. The fast flowing from one pose to another is what a sun salutation IS. This is how a good intermediate/advanced yoga class goes. DON'T buy it if you've never taken a yoga class. The DVD does not give specific instructions on how to do the poses: you have to know all that before you do it. But if you've done some yoga and want a DVD that will kick your butt, this is a great one."
1,More painful than useful,"I have been doing yoga for years and while I wouldn't consider myself a ""yogi"" I can generally make it through even an advanced yoga class. I thought that this would be a fun, more interesting yoga workout for home. I thought wrong. The warm up is not even a warm-up, the music doesn't make sense with the flow of the movements and there is very little instruction. The instruction that is given is unclear and can definitely lead to someone getting hurt! I have tried this video a few times and found it difficult, painful, and probably the worst yoga video I've found."
3,Be careful with this one!,"Though this is a decent workout, I was disappointed with it. There should have been greater instruction for some of the more intricate poses, or at least a warning that the DVD assumes a working knowledge of yoga. I agree that some of the poses could be dangerous, and the flow is fast. The music got on my nerves after a while. I think there are better power yoga videos out there. I would not purchase another workout featuring this instructor."
2,Not happy with this one !,"I don't understand why the pace of the poses go so fast, not giving a chance to stretch and lengthen to build strength ! It felt like it was an aerobics session, not at all yoga ! I actually did not finish doing the session as I got so frustrated 'cuz I felt I was being rushed through the poses...I just clicked the stop button ! Will be giving this away for sure !"
5,A real workout that requires energy,"This DVD really is not as hard as everyone makes it out to be. I really liked it because it's not difficult yoga pose-wise, it just forces you to move very, very quickly. It's not a lazy person's excuse for a workout. It's non-stop & definitely the fastest pace yoga class I have ever been a part of. It's not boring like many DVDs in the yoga/pilates genre tend to be. I mainly do my workout in the gym, and I thought I would change it up a bit a couple of days a week. So do this when you wake up, have had your coffee, and are ready to move!"
2,Disappointed,"I have several yoga videos, and this is the worst of the lot. This routine just whips through the poses too fast, no time to hold any of the poses which is necessary to build strength. The music was really good, however."
1,disclaimer is true,"I bought this DvD hoping for a little more cardio in my yoga, what I got was a bunch of alternative looking twenty somethings doing things that should not be attempted if you are not already warmed up. Not only was the audio not synced, so you ended up watching her lips move independently of her words, but they don't tell you how to make to different yoga poises more doable for us less flexible until after you have done the move. So you have already tried to do the advanced move before the beginners. I pulled a stomach muscle trying to scramble back into one of the poses and haven't picked up this DvD since."
3,Fast Paced and Challenging,"This yoga workout is about 45 minutes long. It is a challenging workout and definately not for beginners. The sun salutations at the beginning are especially fast paced--almost to the point of being too fast--you might get injured moving so quickly. But, the tape slows down after that and you hold most poses for a count of 3 breaths. It includes many warrior positions and balancing poses. Then you move to the floor to finish up doing backbends and fowardbends. If you like to move quickly this workout is for you. I was a little worried that the music would be annoying and not relaxing (because of the MTV association) but it was actually okay."
4,very good,"I love this DVD. I also have the first one and I thought Power Yoga is a much better improvement. It is very challenging but it's something to get you in shape and feel good thoughout your body. On the last video she would mess up the breathing. On this one, she still messes up a little, but it is better I have to admit. I wouldn't reccomend Power Yoga to begginers because you really have to know what you are doing because it is so fast paced."
4,Challenge for newbies,"Looking for a way to be able to break into Yoga at home I picked up the MTV Power Yoga video. The other yoga video I have was very difficult to follow as it jumped between segement and did not establish a routine. This DVD was very smooth to watch, however it was very fast paced and sometimes I felt that I didn't have enough instruction on some of the poses. However most routines were repeated so after a couple of times I could get the swing of things and expect to be able to really excel when I go back again. The workout length is perfect and I definitely worked up a sweat. I think this is more of an aerobics video using yoga positions. As I would expect from MTV, the music did enhance the video and was not the cheesy music most workout tapes/dvds have."
4,The best I've tried.,"I have tried many yoga videos and MTV is my favorite. Here are a few reasons why:1) Instructor only soundtrack option. Thanks for not subjecting me to panflute and new age synth pads.2) Instructor dialogue is part of class. Videos with overdubbed instruction often seem out of synch with the practice. Kristin speaks as she is doing yoga and the resulting instruction is well integrated with the practice. I record the soundtrack onto CD and practice without the TV - works great.3) A great series. Both MTV Yoga and Power Yoga feature well thought out, full body work-outs - great flow, very thorough. The first video focuses (generally) more on hips and holding poses - Power Yoga more fast-paced flow and backbending.4) The yoga is presented without any new age or otherwise spiritual overtones.Works for me!"
4,Better than the first,"I have to disagree with some of the other reviews; I have the first video too and found this one much more envigorating. Ok, so I am a member of the MTV Generation - but then thats exactly who its marketed for. I know there isn't a slow pace and it doesn't mention anything about the spiritual side - but I cant bear that Austen woman and her 'keep smiling, you can do it' rubbish. And I would imagine most of my peers are the same.I found the workout much more enduring than the previous video, and I know I will be aching in the morning. I had watched the workout through before I began and couldnt believe some of the poses they were doing, but I am really pleased that they weren't as hard as they look.I loved the pilates section on Abs at the end, and even if i don't use the workout every day I will at least have time to do the pilates.Personally I am glad that I didn't bother listening to the reviews and find out for myself how fab this video is."
3,MTV tried....,"This was the most repetitive yoga DVD I have done. I liked it because I was constantly moving, which got my heart rate up, but I only did it once before I got rid of it.The first 1/2 of the DVD was variations of the sun salutation, which got old really fast. The 2nd half was more challenging and had more variety. I got rid of it because I couldnt endure the endless sun salutations again. I have Fat Blasting Yoga by Denise Austin and Advanced Yogilates and prefer them both to MTV power yoga."
1,No.,"Don't buy this one.This video contains all of less than half the videos on They Might Be Giants's later release, Direct From Brooklyn, which is also available here on VHS. New, I might add. Although these videos are great, don't waste your money on this tape when you could just get Direct From Brooklyn instead. You won't miss anything by buying the later video. (Unless you just want this for the slipcase or something.)"
3,Show is great; DVD has problems,"After a very long wait, I was excited to finally have the opportunity to get Season Two of ""Once and Again"". The show is fantastic.However, I returned the DVD set because of glitches. Everytime that a camera angle changed, the screen would flash. Then, the video was in slow motion for about one-two seconds. This happened every time that the angle would change!! Very annoying and distracting. So, I returned it for a new set. Same problems with the new set. I guess it's a problem with all of the Season Two sets. Too bad. It definately detracts from a wonderful drama."
5,the best!,"i love this show because it tackles on relationships, and depicts closely to the lives we live. i was sad to see the show gone, because its one of the most well written and acted shows on tv, but i guess the saying ""all good things always come to an end"" is true. i was so happy to finally see the 2nd season being release. i waited for 3yrs .i guess that's more than enough wait. hopefully season 3 will come soon. please don't make me wait for another 3yrs. i can't bare it."
5,Where is the FINAL Season?,I love this series. Great Story and Acting! But where is the FINAL Season? It has been years since the Second Season. I want my closure!!!!!!!
5,Season Three,"In response to Sue A. Elkins of Bloomington, IN, yes, there are only three seasons. The show was cancelled in it's final season due to ratings. I remember the last episode when it aired as it was a two hour event.Season three, the final season, was scheduled to be released this last January. Commentary for the final episode has been done in late summer as they had planned and anticipated to get it released right away after the release of season 2. However, in late October, announcement came out (although not too boldly), that it'll be delayed. Word of it's new release date have not been annouced as of yet--at least not to my knowledge. Hope this helps and gives you some insight."
5,A very basic book,"It is a good book for beginners who do not have any idea of proteomics. The language is simple and the concepts flow very nicely. But you might want to invest in another book if required for advanced concepts. Well, That is very obvious from the title. Overall, a good book!"
2,Not Suitable as an Introduction,"You don't have to get past the first page to understand that this is not the book for a beginner. No definitions, compound sentences... It reads the same way too many professors lecture these days: as though the student already knows the material. The former review is correct in that the book is a collection of essays and not an introductory text. However, if you are already an expert in proteomics you probably don't have the time or inclination to read a collection of essays... so who is this book for?"
2,Nothing Useful or New,I was disappointed with this book. It presents general overview of linguistics and language development that one can find in multiple other sources. There is no practical advise on raising children bilingually. Case studies illustrating possible scenarios are for the most part inapplicable and lack detail to be useful in practice. There are very few books that should go straight into recycling bin - and this is one of them.
3,The Bilingual Family : A Handbook for Parents,Limited use. I wanted a book to help me with how to approach bylinguilism but this book was just theory.
2,Not a handbook for parents,"This is a very comprehensive book about the general subject of raising bilingual children, based on a number of case studies. I am sure that therefore it would be of great use to anyone studying a linguistic subject in this realm.However as a handbook for parents who want to raise a bilingual child it hardly offers any advise. I have a different native tongue than my wife, who's native language is English. Living in an English speaking country I would like my daughter to learn my (foreign) native language too. What I was looking for is a book with tips and ideas, such as word games, books, etc. to bring a second language playfully and naturally into a toddler's life.If you are looking for such a book too, this is not the one. Although the book may be good for a linguistics student I have to give it a low rating because of its misleading title."
4,This is more like it.,"I had just finished reviewing a book for the younger reader about Sharks Where I was disappointed to find the content patronising and everything set in large type - as though children are blind as well as stupid. Then, to my utter delight, the very next book in my pile of ""reviews to be completed"" was this one - and what a contrast.This book explains almost every single aspect of the Shark. It starts out by asking various questions; Which is the biggest Shark in the world?; How many teeth does a Great White have?, and so forth. But asking these questions is easy, it is the reply which takes both skill and, above all, knowledge. In this book, the author demonstrates both those attributes as, page after page, we are treated to a complete exposé of the Shark - inside and out (literally!).This book is a most useful tool and equally important to those who simply want their questions answered as it is for those who scuba dive and wonder about meeting these much-maligned creatures.NM"
5,All three discs on heavy rotation in my CD player,"Although the first CD is my favorite, all three of them are pretty great. One song I wish were in this collection but is not is ""Quello che non ho."""
1,Waste of money,"I've gone through 2 of these in 1 month. On the first, the right headphone stopped working after about 2 weeks. The second pair -- same problem, but only after 1 week. I don't know if they're just from a bad batch or what...The sound is ok, but they're not that comfortable. They're rough on the ears, and the way they curve around your neck almost inhibits your movement.For retail of 29.95, they're a major letdown."
3,Great for running but...,I really enjoy running with them but they don't stay long - less thean a year for about 40-60 miles of running per week. Still looks like great deal considering the price.
4,A well made unique anime,"Neo ranga is a fairly good japanese anime, but the 15 minute epesodes restric any sirious plot/charecter development. I enjoyed it despite some of its minor flaws becuase it is very uniqe. Enjoyable but there is better for your money."
3,Two out of three are good,"I love Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot. ""Death on the Nile"" and ""Evil Under the Sun"" are both really good mystery movies. Unfortunately, the 3rd movie in this collection, ""The Mirror Crack'd"" featuring Angela Landsbury as Jane Marple, does not compare to the other two movies.I wish they had the third Hercule Poirot movie, ""Appointment with Death"", in this collection. I don't think that movie is as good as the other two but the set would have been the perfect Hecurle Poirot trilogy with that movie. Also, the 3rd movie has yet to be released on DVD in the US."
5,Agatha Christie's best,"For those who love a good mystery well interpreted by fine actors, this is your package. Peter Ustinov plays a wonderful Hercule Poirot"
5,I love the style of these films!,I have always loved the style of these films. Really enjoy having the boxed set. Great when you want something nostalgic to watch.
4,Very good,"I have loved ""Murder in the Orient Express"" since I was a young girl and wanted to give more Hercule Poirot movies a try. I got the bonus Miss Marple movie with the set. I enjoyed all three. They were not as good as ""Murder on th Orient Express"" but still really good movies. If I had not seen the other movie first I would have loved them even more but I was comparing them to the best in the set. Really great acting and really great mysteries. I would totally recomend them to detective mystery fans."
3,Older production editions,"These 3 movies based on Agatha Christie's novels are great, and look good on a wide-screen TV. But these are older editions, and do not have subtitles. A TV's close captioning program does not work with a Blu-ray disc player. So if the DVD or Blu-ray disc does not have subtitles, you get to turn up the volume and disturb everyone else in the house. But these are very enjoyable movies."
5,Mystery fans .... Attention,If u love agatha Christie this is a must! There great flicks in one DVD! It's a great addition to any mystery fans collection!
5,Death on the Nile and Evil Under the Sun,"Peter Ustinov is fabulous as Hercule Poirot (""not 'parrot"" Poirot, as if you are about to bestow a kiss."") It's a blast to have such all star casts: Mia Farrow, David Niven, Bette Davis, Maggie Smith (in both!), Roddy McDowell, James Mason to name a few. The films are extremely well produced, lotsa fun, great Cole Porter music, and that lovely 40's opulence of the wealthy. Peter brings a dash of humor to the role but doesn't spare the ""little grey cells"". Love these, wish there were more made with Ustinov, he really brings a different dimension to the role. Love, love, love it!As far as the actual dvd is concerned, excellent quality and a great deal: three for the price of one! You get Evil Under The Sun, Death on the Nile and the Mirror Cracked. Really, it's required! Gotta have this in your dvd library!!!"
1,They Like to Never Quit Praising God: The Role of Celebration in Preaching,"I placed an order for this book a few weeks ago, at the end of January or the first of February and I have not received it yet. I am anxious to read it because I know there is much within the pages that will be of great help to my ministry to women, but at this time I cannot comment because I have have not received it yet.Lorraine"
2,Factory seconds,This item must have been factory seconds it just doesn't look right but it's a hassel to return some $5.00 item so buyers beware this could be a factory second. that all I have to say about that.
1,Sample Application poorly debugged,"I entirely agree with Mercedes. Like Mercedes, I have also done a lot of Access and Excel programming. I also found this book a big disappointment. The Personal Organizer application did not work. I also went to the Wrox site and found that other people had the same problem. I really can't recommend this book to anyone because of the problems with getting the Personal Organizer application to work. Definitely not for beginners."
2,Also disappointed,"Like the last reviewer, I'm not new to programming (I'm just new to PC based languages), and I chose this book for entry into VB 2005. This book is very poor in it's presentation, walk throughs, and exercises. I'm only midway through the book, but I am here on Amazon again searching for other publishers.One aspect that I had liked about this book was that Wrox had a series of VB2005 books that would lead to a natural progression in learning. I was planning to follow this book with VB2005 Databases, but now it is likely I will not purchase any other Wrox book. (I only hope this isn't the best of what's out there for books on VB2005.)"
2,Was disappointed,"I'm not brand new to programming, I have done lots of programming in Excel and Access, just never used actual Visual Basic. I bought this book hoping for guideance in VB 2005 Express. The first part of the book is ok, no trouble following the examples, but as the Personal Organizer application/database became more complex, I started to get lost. The code didn't always work, the samples don't work, constant errors that it can't find the database. When in doubt of the code I entered I would copy the authors code and still it wouldn't work. It felt like there were a couple steps missing here and there. This is very frustrating to me. Also, the example code should work when loaded from the disc, when it doesn't it's more frustrating. The SQL section is ok, again seems a bit vague to me. I have since moved onto Microsoft Visual Basic 2005 Step by Step by Michael Halvorson and am having no trouble at all, not feeling lost anymore. And the examples actually work!"
5,a chilling account of being stuck in a cult,"I read this book straight through. It's sort of creepy to see what this poor fellow got stuck in but he did get out of it. Oh seekers of truth, it warns us by just telling the story, don't give up your own truth for another's. I went to hear Rama in San Francisco in 87 with some friends from the SF Zen Center and it was a fun trip that we all got a big kick out of though we thought he was just a slick con man. This book tells about the con and the madness and suffering going on with Rama and his students. It should stay in print and be kept in the libraries of all religious institutions."
4,The nearly perfect guide to the Tick TV animated series,"Greg Hyland (of Lethargic Lad fame) did a great job on this hilarious book that has a nearly complete episode guide, a list of heroes and villains and hero lessons in this awesome book. Greg Hyland did great work and knows how to get a belly laugh out of me. Only Ben Edlund himself could have done it better. Great book for fans of the animated series. The only problem is that they should have waited for the series to finish so they could have a more complete book."
2,Graphic SF Reader,"A small bit of Tick info, but you are better off just getting the actual material, itself. Then again, if it is only $2, no real harm done."
5,Wasn't tomorrow wonderful,"One of my all time favorites from the 80's, the lyrics are brilliant! Glad it is available to download, my vinyl to disc copy was poor."
3,"""I Know What Boys Like"": Another funny, quirky song from 1982","""I Know What Boys Like"" is yet another funny, quirky song from 1982; Bow Wow Wow's ""I Want Candy"" and Toni Basil's ""Mickey"" are two others that come to mind. The only other Waitresses hits I'm aware of were ""Square Pegs,"" the theme from the short-lived TV show, and a holiday song called ""Christmas Wrapping,"" both found on the 1982 EP I Could Rule the World If I Could Only Get the Parts. Sadly, singer Patty Donahue died of cancer in 1996."
4,Good basic whisks,"These are well made, basic whisks, and are a good value!However, if you are considering buying them, think about this. The smallest whisk has a very short and small handle. Since our hands aren't smaller when we are using a small whisk, this makes extended use of the whisk (if you have a large hand) inconvenient and tiring, especially if you are trying to whisk a fairly thick batter for example.Second, consider how you store your whisks. If in a drawer, these are fine. If you want to hang them over your stove, they don't have hanger loops on the butt of the handle.With those considerations in mind, these are very good products."
1,Was broken out of the box,"Don't get this product, when I opened the box gray dust came out of it and i saw that the metal cap out of the bigger whisk was ofand gray dust was coming out of the cement that was used to hold the head to the handle. the overall build quality is poor over all."
1,Do not buy,Do not buy these whisks. I used them for about two months until the end cap popped off when I was whisking a batter and sand/rocks fell out of the handle into the batter making it inedible. Horrible product and a waste of money and now food.
1,Can't recommended it.,"In less than six months one of the wires came out of the big whisk. I thought Norpo was a good brand, and maybe I just got a dud. I am disappointed! I love my Pampered Chef whisk (and have had it for 13 years), but I would like a balloon whisk. (PC one is slender and great for making sauces in pans, but the balloon ones are nice for mixing flour mixtures!)"
2,"Great Initial Quality, but did not last long- very disappointing","I usually don't write review but this one I'm very disappointed at. I brought this set July 2011 and used it at least once a month. I always washed it after using it and drying it before putting it away. After the first few months, I noticed that when I use it, water would drip out of the handle- I thought it didn't dry ""enough"". In the past 6 months, the water is now brown colored but I didn't really notice or thought about it, I had to wrap a tissue by the handle so the water doesn't get into the food. Just yesterday the handle came off and I saw that it was rusted all inside the handle. There was no sign of rusting outside of the handle. I always thought Norpro was a great brand, since my brother in law has the same set.Good whisk, but disappointing because the handle rusted inside and fell off."
2,Very small,When I opened the package I laughed my head off. There is no balloon about it. A balloon whisk is not stiff. the largest whisk looks like it might be able to beat 2 eggs. Don't waste your money.
3,Disappointed,The end cap of the largest one came off with some sort of material spilling out of it. Disgusting. The smaller two were fine. I would rather have a whisk that had an end loop on it so I can hang it.
2,Surprised - poorly manufactured,I ordered Norpro and paid more than I would have for these. Was surprised that after the second round in the dishwasher as I put them in my utensil drawer the medium whisk's handle-cap came off and dumped sand all over the drawer. Rather inconvenient but worse - disappointed in the product manufacture or quality control. Would not recommend.
3,Not sealed - water with rust is draining from handle,"I will be calling Norpro on Monday. The handles are leaking water with rust. They advertise them as being dishwasher safe, however the handles on mine must be defective and not sealed. Other than that, I love this set!"
5,Very pleased with item.,"Received the item in a timely manor and it was as described.Will always order items from Amazon's sight, when needed."
1,Disks at end of handle stick out and are sharp!,"These wshisks are light and overall are constructed well. HOWEVER, the disk at the end of the handle sticks out and is quite sharp! I was not going to risk getting my hand cut while using this thing and since it's too much trouble to return them to Amazon, I just tossed them out in the trash! What a waste of money!"
2,Be careful -- sharp edges!,"These whisks are very nice, actually, and they feel good. They are not flimsy or anything, but I can't give them more than two stars because I actually cut myself with the medium sized one. The metal that is close to the ballooning wires is very sharp and it nicked my thumb when I pulled it out of the package. I imagine that most of them are not like that, due to the other reviews, but I am sad that I'll have to throw that one out."
2,Whisks Filled with Sand,"When I purchased this item I read the reviews first and the positive outweighed the negative. But my experience falls on the negative side. When I used the biggest whisk the first time the end cap fell off and SAND fell into my food. That's right, the handles are filled with sand to give them weight. I emptied the sand and put the cap back on. Then I threw it in the dishwasher and when I pulled it out the whisk head came off and was instantly rusted. I have since thrown these items out. Don't buy them."
3,Great until they come off at the handles...,"I initially thought these were great, until I was making something that required rapid whisking (was making a special frosting recipe) I used the largest one and it came off at the handle, the wisk just came off into the frosting base I was whisking and generally did not really seem to want to attach back on... Looks like I'm in the market for a new whisk..."
3,Smaller than expected,"As others have said, these are of good quality. However, I was a little disappointed by their size. Each one is much smaller (thinner and shorter) than I expected. If I would have seen this set in a store for this price I probably would have passed them up and sought out a larger set. If they were $5 or so cheaper I probably wouldn't be disappointed at all."
2,Too small to be useful,I suppose the smallest one could be given to a child.Even the largest of the three is small with too few wires to effectively whip.
5,Whip it! Whip it good!,"What can I say, they're whisks. Well made and functinal, although I've found little use for the itty-bitty one. Anything I'd use that one for can be done just as well with a fork. The other two in the set get a lot of use in my kitchen."
1,Defective and filled with SAND!,I received this whisk set and the end caps were all falling off and the handles were filled with a sand like substance. That is pretty disgusting considering they are used for cooking. Would not recommend this product.
3,"Nice variety of sizes, but dent easily","These whisks are great in that there are so many sizes, you can always find the right one. And my three-year-old loves using the tiny one to help cook.BUT they do dent easily. The handles are hollow, and each of them has at least one little dent in it. We don't use them particularly roughly either."
3,Decent whisks except for one,The large and medium size whisk are fine. The smallest whisk however is difficult to use. The handle is REALLY short and it seems child-sized. I figured that just the which part would be a smaller size but the handle is too and it is hard to whisk with.
5,Great Whisks,"I bought this set for my daughter for Christmas, when she complained of a whisk she got as a housewarming gift that was rusted. I personally have a set myself that I've had for several years and they are great whisks! They work well, have nice handles, clean up well and do not rust. I put mine in the dishwasher, no problem. These are honestly the best set of whisks I have had in 28 years of marriage. I highly recommend!"
5,I loved the ease of purchasing my All-American canner from Amazon.com,"It was so easy to order my canner. I had an old one for years and still works fine, just wanted a large canner - holds 14 quarts, does twice the work and the slim bottom design allows me to use my old canner and my new one at the same time on my stove. Amazon.com thanks for excellent prices and free delivery."
5,Top of the line pressure canner! Great service!,"I received my new #930 in late September '09. Having just returned from a sucessful tuna fishing charter, I had lots of canning to do. Following the directions in the box, the first 21 half pint jars of fresh ""ahi"" turned out pertectly all done in one batch.I was a bit dismayed at first when the pressure guage was bent in shipping. No problem, Wisconsin Foundry shipped a new one immediately! Looks like it will last forever...totally happy!"
5,All American 30 Quart Pressure Cooker/Canner,"Exceeded Expectations, Priced well, Delivered on time, tool not a toy, safe to use, I highly recommend this AMERICAN MADE product as BEST IN CLASS! Able to handle small or large quantities, ideal and a must have for the home, gardener, fisher-person, big game Hunter that has harvested more than they can eat, freeze or store. I give it a 10 star rating out of 5 WOW!!!"
4,Not Disappointed,"I seldom buy things that live up to my expectations anymore...but I must say that the All-American Pressure Cooker/Canner did not leave me disappointed. It is well made and should truly be something to hand down to my children and grandchildren. We got the 30-qt. and it is quite heavy, I just happen to still have a husband to help out...would be difficult on my own...also I am 5'2"" tall and so I have to stand on a stool to load and unload it. But we chose that one because we could can more quarts at one time. We would purchase again."
5,"Great, Big Canner!","Every year we process a beef, and this year we decided we wanted to can some of it. We had never canned anything before, so we did some research and bought this pressure canner. We ended up canning about 45 quarts of beef, and with this being able to hold 14 quart jars at a time, it was a real time saver. It is extremely sturdy. I like that it has no gasket to fuss about (a thin film of Vaseline is used). It is a large beast of a canner, but if you are planning on a lot of canning, this is what you want. After the beef was done, we got some crabapples and made about 12 12oz jars of jelly using this for the water bath. You can't go wrong with this if you are wanting to can a lot at one time. The price is worth it."
5,Exceeded my expectations,This pressure cooker is wonderful. It is made in the USA! I was able to process the double layer of jars on my flat-top cook-top without problems. It was exceptional easy to regulate the PSI as well. My mother has a pressure cooker from the same company that is 30+ years old and it is still going strong.
5,30 pt pressure cooker,"I am very happy with my purchase. The cooker/canner holds more than enough to can at one time, is very easy to use and very sturdy. I especially like the locking screw knobs as opposed to the old gasket type."
1,Disappointed,"Dog Mania (Purchased on 11/24/2008Was a disappointment. It is extremely complicated; has inexact pieces that don't quite fit with each other and is simply no fun.I put it away when neither I, my daughter nor my teenage grandchildren liked it.Sorry!!Ms T. Santini"
3,"BEST BOOK ON KHALSAS,","THIS BOOK IS NOT ONLY ""A BOOK ON SIKH`S HISTORY"". THIS IS A MASTER PIECE WHICH IS CREATED BY DR.CYNTHIA MAHMOOD IN A EXCELANT PROFESSIONAL WAY."
1,no sikh in india cares about khalistan any longer,"Support for a separate sikh nation is no longer there among sikhs in India. Infact, even during the height of terrorism a very small percentage of sikhs supported the cause. Currently the only sikhs who support this cause are sikhs outside of India who are far removed from realities in India. This book fails to capture that. It also fails to capture the Pakistani hand behind all this which Benazir Bhutto admitted to in one of the interviews. Infact, lots of millitants were Pakistanis posing as Punjabi Sikhs. Also, it needs to be updated now that the struggle is no longer their in Punjab."
3,"""Owl"" makes an interesting read","Although ""Owl in Love"" was not the best fantasy story I've ever read, it did have some creative elements and turned out to be a rather enjoyable read.Obviously, nothing about 14-year-old Owl is normal. Not only does she look strange and is passionately in love with her forty-year-old science teacher, but she is also a wereowl (meaning she can transform into an owl at will).If you can get past the first few pages or so, which really are quite creepy and a little disorienting, this book does not turn out to be too bad. It is very predictable; the story does not hide its secrets very well. It's also a very short read that you can get through in a couple of hours.But, it's a story from a new perspective. The concept of a girl who is mostly owl was a fresh and interesting one...after you get past the initial shock of her first descriptions, this book does actually turn out okay with a nicely wrapped-up ending.KelliFuture Star"
5,A great book to read on a winter night with some hot cocoa.,"Owl Tycho, 14, is in love with her science teacher, Mr. Lindstrom. Nothing strange about that, right? Wrong. Owl IS an owl, or at least a wereowl. She perches every night outside of Mr. Lindstorm's window, and watches him sleep. But when a strange, violent boy appears in the woods just outside of her beloved one's house, and a stranger mad owl in the woods as well, Owl may be in danger...And Mr. Lindstorm! In this funny, heartwarming, romance/mystery, you'll learn about Owl's strange ways, and how-or IF-she saves herself and her one-way lover. Charming, mystical, a wonderfully good read"
4,Pretty good book,"I enjoyed this book. I read it for my summer reading requirement at my school. I liked the story, and everything else about it, except I wish I could have found out a little bit more about people's reactions at the end of the book. This is an interesting and weird and good book."
2,The Best of Jo Ann Castle,"Barely 20 minutes for a full priced CD seems thin. Some of the selections are very good, and some average to below.""Tiger Rag"" accompanied by a tuba sounds more like a lap cat than a tiger."
2,Box Sets,Always love family guy..Seems that there is several versions of Volume..The only let down is that Vol 1 - 6 were in a boxset. Vol 7 - 9 had no outer sleeve and now in single case.. makes the set look silly.Amazon version come without outer cover.. which makes their picture on this product wrong! The outer sleeve is needed as it contains all the information about the contents of the DVD.Thanks.
2,"Seth,...please!","Seth Mcfarlane,I've been a dedicated watcher and buyer since 1999.This volume is good if you're a dedicated sado-maso(S&M;)type who is STILL waiting for FG to get back to being fun,funny,and clever,not an animated conjugation of the word STINK(stink,stank,stunk)...Volume Nine better hit one out of the park."
1,Hugely Disappointing,"I have always been a big Family Guy fan especially of Stewie. I have ALL the DVD's released and i must say Vol 8 is the worst. Its like they are not trying anymore, whatever rubbish comes to their head they produce it. Stewie was the life of the show, even killing people, now he is a gay transvestite that gets beat up by baby girls. Humourous moments are rare and far in between. The show is just not funny anymore in fact it is just absurd and ridiculous now, sorry to say."
4,Somewhat Satisfied,"The content that is on the disc is great, but there just isn't enough. 15 episodes for $40.00? You can get twice the episodes in HD for $40.00. Good product just kind of expensive."
1,3rd Set & Still Getting Defective Disks,"Content-wise, no complaints.But I just received my 2nd replacement set yesterday, (3rd set overall). On each set, Disc 2 has consistently caused a very-noticeable vibration from all players I tried, including Denon & Sony Blu-Ray players, and the DVD readers on 2 Lenovo laptops. On one set, Discs 1 and 3 also caused a vibration, though not as bad as Disc 2.I would love to watch this set as it has some incredibly funny episodes. But until Fox gets this defect worked out, I'll do without. I cannot subject my players to these defective discs. Sooner or later, all that vibration would inevitably cause damage to the players, or at best, shorten their lifespans."
1,It upsets me to see how bad the show has gotten,"I've been watching the show since it premiered, and it was great in the beggining. I have the first 6 volumes, which are great. Volume 7 was ehh, but this is appaling. The show is not funny anymore, and it's basically all flashbacks. It's hard to even focus on the plot theres so many! Plus, I hate the way the characters have changed. Everybody hates meg, stewie is gay, brian is a pothead who can't keep a steady relationship, chris is just dumb as hell, peter is dumber than ever and not even funny, and lois in a nutcase. I never thought this show would jump the shark, but it sure has."
5,Stew-Roids and the Family,This set has all the best episodes from Stewie roiding it up to Quagmire becoming a father for an episode. All in all it ranges from decent in a couple episodes to rofl in a few. Definitely one to get for the collection. And I have them all.
1,"Rating the presentation, not the content","Okay, I will be the first to bash Family Guy for not being as funny as it used to be, but I will give them credit here. This is a 4 rating if I was to just rate the episodes and their quality.But I am not writing about their quality, I am writing about how I am not to pleased that I purchased this DVD and got a Full-Screen Presentation. I have read that Seth MacFarlane doesn't believe that 16:9 is needed for his or any other show, but come on. At least make an attempt to stretch this. I would rather have a slightly, not as impressive picture, than to waste about 5 inches each side of my TV. (I know about the scan option, but it cuts off most of the picture on my television). I think Fox should at least try to explore added a widescreen version of Family Guy DVDs. I get this same thing on XBOX Live and it's just disappointing. If South Park can do it, I am sure Family Guy can make the attempt.With that being said, I do like a lot of episodes on this Volume."
4,More Great Stuff from Seth,"I managed a copy of these episode through some sources. The first 2 episodes are great. Stewie and Brian jumping from universe to universe in the multi-verse and the whole Kathy Ireland cardboard cut-out gag were some of the best work I have seen yet. The rest of the season is more of the classic stuff. The episode with the maid was good for some fresh laughs. I would have given it 5 stars, but come on, how many more times are we going to see the front knocked off Cleveland's house and the bathtub falling out, and hear the annoying Surfing Bird song. These were funny is Volume 7, but in Volume 8, they get a little old.C"
1,Don't get me wrong.,"Don't get me wrong. I absolutely love Family Guy. But I put a disc into my computer to watch it, and it just wouldn't play. Sounds like with the label the disc is too thick.I tried every single one. Same result. Every other movie or show plays perfect."
5,"Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa...shut up, Meg!","Everyone's favorite cartoon family! How can a Family Guy fan not own this collection? Hysterical, entertaining and promotes fmaily values...good and bad!"
3,One bad apple doesn't quite spoil the bunch,"Let's get this out of the way: Yes, Family Guy has gone downhill. And yes, this collection has THE worst Family Guy made to date: ""Not All Dogs Go To Heaven."" Not to mention some of the other episodes are nearly as bad.But there are enough genuinely funny episodes to make up for the garbage. Shows like Episode 420, Family Goy, and Three Kings make this collection worth buying IF you can get it cheap ($15 or less). Pick this one up if you like Family Guy, but only when Amazon is running a good sale on it."
2,funny but,"family guy used to dance on the political fence. this season is 100% political something tells me i wont be buying volume 8.in volume 7 and 8 ,seth macfarlane ( who used to be on every commentary track before volume 7) BARELY has time to grace us with his presence for even 20 minutes at a time every episode.he instead leaves it his underlings. i think seth only did a few, and he was in a sound booth every time.before he was on just about every commentary track. whats wrong seth? family guy not good enough for you???"
5,"Makes me laugh like peter, AKA giggle like a retard","I love Family Guy. I disagree with most of the political views they voice, almost everything the show portrays, but ohhh man, it does make me laugh like few other shows can."
2,Time to let it go Seth...,"I like the early Family Guy seasons. They had a certain 'edge' to them that was refreshing and funny. The show got cancelled and then it came back worse than it was. I think Family Guy has run it's course. Like another reviewer stated, all that's left of the show it seems are a series of pop culture references and bawdy humor that more often than not, isn't funny. There doesn't seem to be much of a story to any of the episodes anymore. It's usually a thin premise to have stupid jokes and offensive physical 'humor.' There are a couple of episodes that are enjoyable in this set, but most are just the same old, tired formula.And I think Matt Groening needs to watch a few because some of the storylines and jokes seem lifted right out of past Simpson's episodes. I enjoy watching reruns of the earliest Family Guy seasons, but the newest ones just do nothing for me. My advice is to check out 'American Dad' where there are actual stories to be had and laughs abound."
4,Great way to monitor your freezer,"I bought this device with the express purpose of keeping track of the internal temperature of the chest freezer we keep in our garage. With the remote sensor snuggled deep in the freezer, and the main display unit hanging on the wall, I can see the temperature of the interior of the garage and see how cool the freezer is at a glance. So far, so good."
1,Wireless indoor/outdoor thermometer,This product is totally unsatisfactory. It could not transmit the outside temperature to the base. I tried several different locations for both the transmitter and the base with no success. Only when the two were only one or two feet apart inside the house could the base read the transmissions.
4,Great item,"A good product, but can't be mounted too close to a wireless phone or the signal from the outside unit is interrupted. Small hassle. Easy to read from across the room and is accurate."
1,Wireless sensor never worked,"I purchased this for my father for Father's Day, but was disappointed that it never actually worked. I installed fresh batteries and followed all instructions (it's not particularly complex to set up), but the wireless sensor never connected to the base station. I left them in close proximity to each other for 72 hours and it didn't work at all. I tried moving them around a little bit to ensure that there was no interference, but that had no effect. I wouldn't recommend this wireless thermometer."
1,Intermittant Performance,"The unit has nice, large digits, but the wireless sensors don't work consistantly. The system works for perhaps 3 days and then the wireless link goes down. We have to remove the remote sensor batteries and reinstall them for the link to be re-established."
1,taylor should be out of the thermometer business,"the display is dim, the battery compartment requires a chinese screwdriver to open it. installing batteries shouldn't lead to injury. then the remote didn't work.the product deserves 0 stars."
4,Just Works,"We have had this set for quite a while. Replace batteries in both units and re-sync at that time, once a year. It just works.Since my wife works outside most of the time, it helps to know the REAL outside temperature especially on cold mornings. She really appreciates that aspect of having a good remote unit.I tried to find the instruction manual online, but can't seem to find it, or the Taylor web site."
2,Taylor 1456 I/O Thermometer,"The thermometer worked as advertised right out of the box. The extra large readout is nice. However, the remote unit used up it's 2 'AA' batteries within a few days. After a few more changes of batteries with the same result, the remote unit then failed to reconnect. The Taylor Model 1456 has been returned to the manufacturer for repair/replacement."
1,Good idea but poorly executed.,"I wanted a thermometer that could tell me the temperature in the house, outside, in my greenhouse, and soil temperature in my garden. In theory this thermometer should be able to do all four ( with extra remotes added on) but unfortunately the transmission range from the remote to the base unit is no where even close to the 100 ft listed on the packaging. I have found it closer to 35 feet MAXIMUM. The lithium batteries must be installed in the remote to get temperature readings below -4'F - The four tiny screws and little rubber gasket are a poor design to get access to the battery and channel switch compartment."
1,not much to review when it doesn't work,Wildly innacurate when it did but for the most part this was a waste of time and money
4,"Excellent, well-documented story of exploration & mapping.","A narrative that will appeal to those interested in western US history, natural science, geography, and exploration. Features excellent word portraits of the four survey groups, their leaders and key members, and descriptions of the conditions, methods, equipment and problems encountered. Includes a selection of contemporary photographs. The only negative: The several maps included are too small and require use of magnifying glass to read the fine print."
4,Manifest destiny,"American youth are from an early age caused to revere the quasi-apotheosized Lewis and Clark, and not without good reason. It is disillusioning later to learn that the impulse for most Western explorations was ultimately pecuniary -- furs, timber, minerals. The Great Surveys, however, were in large part made with more fundamental intent to systematically expand our knowledge of the geography, geology, natural history, and ethnography of the vast world beyond the Great Plains. Accounts of these surveys, understandably, are not so much thrilling Wild West tales (although they are that in part!) as they are a grand story of our beginning to coolly comprehend the once mysterious terra incognita of the Western frontier. You can't understand nineteenth-century American history unless you are informed about these Great Surveys. This is very informative reading."
1,GOOD MOVIE: WRONG REGION,"This is the only DVD version of this movie that I am aware of and it is region ALL, not region 1. Does not play properly on US player. Soundtrack misallocated and no center channel dialog. Have to restart movie after every chapter and change subtitles back to English. Taiwanese junk, not Japanese. Buy only if you are desperate for DVD or stick with VHS."
5,Iris as her 10th Birthday!!!!,Ok this has to got to be one of the best sakura wars dvds out there. Iris one of my favorite characters wants to have a B-Day Party.. When she was back home in France she had parties alone cause people thought she was dangerous cause of her psicic power... Sakura Decided to throw Iris a very special party for Iris...*VERY GOOD SERIES*
2,Really?,"Within the first few pages of this book, I found like three mistakes, but the one that really bugged me, was the statment he made about no previous groups practicing withcraft before gardener brought it to the United States in 1950. This is not true, the Strega of old Italy practiced withcraft (Strega/Stregone= Female witch/Male witch) called Stregheria (Italian Witchcraft), which was being practiced for years, long before Gardener, and the first book on modern day witchcraft was created by Charles Godfrey Leland in the 1800's. Anyways, dont say that until Wicca, there was no previous groups practicing witchcraft, contarary to populaur belief, Gerald Gardener did NOT create Wicca off of old celtic folk tradtions, but actually from Stregheria and Lelands book, he took old family Strega traditions and turned them into his own little religion, (not saying Wicca isnt valid in practice, but its plagarized in belief and tradition)."
4,Nice Cheese Cloth,"First off, this is a coarse weave cheese cloth, not fine weave, and as such this is a great value... other than that not too much to say about this cheese cloth. I like it, it works just fine, cleans up really well and it's unbleached. The cloth is a good price, especially when you factor in the free shipping / free shipping eligible on this product.And for the cheese makers giving negative reviews, read the description please....-Green Seal of Approval - no bleach is used to make this product-Lint free for dusting and cleaning of furniture, windows and cars-Can be used in the kitchen for steaming, straining, basting, poaching, canning, cleaning and as a spice bag-2 square yards per packageIT DOES NOT SAY IT'S TO BE USED FOR CHEESE MAKING!"
2,really loose weave,"The weave on these is just too loose for me and I have to at least double over cloth so I don't lose everything I'm straining. I mainly use it for straining homemade mozzerella, ricotta and yogurt so I like a tighter weave. Not sure how it would be for other cheeses."
4,Good cloth for making paneer,I used this for making Paneer (Indian Cheese) and it worked well for that purpose. I did not give it 5 stars because I think cloth quality could have been a bit better but then I was not using for the purpose it is made for.
2,Not fine,"While the material itself may deserve praise, the functionality definitely does not. Yes, in four folds it will strain my soured milk from the whey, but it gets tangled and stretched too easily and with four folds cleaning it is very tough. Ive found it best to simply use a piece of cotton such as a t-shirt or a very thin towel which can be washed and reused with much less hassle. A fine cheesecloth also works much better."
1,Disaster cloth,"Try to strain soy milk with this product. You will find yourself covered with soy milk, your hands burnt, your wallet lightened, your mouth full of insults. The trouble with this product is that this is, let's face it, a cheesecloth wannabe, without any real chance to make it in the real world of cheecloths. And here you are, paying the price of this wannabe's unrealistic ambitions. THERE IS TOO MUCH SPACE BETWEEN THREADS! Sorry, but someboy had to tell you, cheesecloth wannabe. Now go and get a job as a mop, you just do not have it in you..."
2,Functional - too thin,"This cloth is just too thin. You need to double and triple layer it for many uses. It works, but it just isn't as nice as a higher quality piece of cloth."
1,Cheese Gauze,"This is not even close to cheesecloth. It's worse then bad. Unfortunately I couldn't use it for its intended purpose which is to make cheese. I compared this to gauze from a medical kit, and the gauze was actually closer knit."
3,nice ring but bad customer service,"The ring is cute, but it was too big. Tried contacting seller about return and got no response."
4,Great towels for dirty jobs,I bought these to go with the steamer that I purchased. I love to use these everywhere when cleaning. White they are but they clean up very good. These will last a while. Not a cheep towel.
5,cotton towels,"Yup. These are exactly what they say they are. Nice, little cotton towels. Work great for cleaning to use instead of paper towels."
2,unsuspected,"I have looked for a heavy cotton cleaning cloth like I have purchased in the past. I checked Home Depot, Lowes, Smart and Final etc. etc. and did not find the quality that I was hoping to find. When I read the product promotion on these cloths the word ""heavy"" caught my eye and I thought I had found what I was used to buying. NO.NO...AND NO! I now have 48 of these cleaning cloths that my cleaning girls must use. I should have sent them back but it is such a hassel. Discouraged"
5,wonderful,The best quality for the price of all terry towels sold on Amazon at this time. I have tried them all. I should know.
1,Junk Towels!!,"When I received the Terry Towels, I could tell they were not very well made. I washed them before I used them and they started falling apart at the seems. Junk, do not purchased these towels. They are horrible. I had purchased some in the past and they were nothing like these. I do not recommend them."
4,Love Zoltan,"Super book, I cannot say enough about any of Zoltan Szabo's books get them all you will not regret it I promise you.I always wish that I had been able to take a workshop class with him, but unfortunately he is no longer with us"
2,Too few words.,It's not for learning new words by listening to the tape. The primary purpose of this tape is not to introduce you to this tape.
5,A Prophetic Word for Today,"How unfortunate it is that the institutional Church insists on placing new wine (the aggiornamento of Vatican II) into old wineskins (structures of power and control). The skins will burst and everything --wine and skins-- will be lost. Father Cozzens' book identifies the ""old wineskins"" of today's institutional Church and points to where the seams are starting to come apart: formation of priests, the exercise of authority and the crisis of credibility. The many priests (and others) who can attest to this book's veracity and insights make this book a work which must be taken very seriously, discussed and responded to in concrete ways."
4,Must Read for Catholics-Our Church is in the hands of the Evil One,"Written by an enlightened, well educated, and expertly experienced priest from the old school. The old school was predominently heterosexual, and for the most part, predominently celibate. Today, approximately 40% of Catholic priests are gay and 55% of the seminarians are gay. According to the author, this has created a gay subculture in our seminaries and throughout the Church starting with priests and extending through the bishops' and cardinals' ranks. This is a subculure that is so entrenched that Church higher ups wonder if it can ever be purged from the Catholic Church. Learn why homosexuality in the Church is driving out the non-homosexual priests and seminarians, thus creating the existing shortage of priests in the American Catholic Church. Read this book and WAKE UP to the threat!"
1,Denial,"The author refuses to face the crisis of the priesthood: a crisis of faith. The American Catholic priesthood is full of people who just don't believe what the Catholic Church teaches, especially when that teaching contradicts the wisdom of the media-academic elite. Who in the world would give his life for the soporific slogans we dole out from the pulpit and in our CCD classes?This is a work of sheer denial."
1,From the armchair,"The author is clearly a good person: concerned about the decline of the number of priests, charitable with priestly failures, open to the fact that people who disagree with him are not demons.But the Mr. Rogers niceness of the author is exactly the problem. Stuck in a pyschological take on the crisis of the priesthood, he cannot go deeper to the real theological crisis. Just why do you need a priest for Mass? How is a priest's preaching different from a good religious talk by a layman? What about the priest as confessor? What about the obvious fact that the crisis is about a group of American clergy and laity who simply do not believe in what the Catholic Church teaches? And we're far beyond dissent on birth control here.The psychological jargon only masks the problem."
1,A review of content,"Nothing new with the situation, A system set up in falsehood cannot create or sustain any kind of order or decent behavior."
5,JOHNNY HODGES WITH LAWRENCE WELK'S ORCHESTRA,"CD ARRIVED IN PERFECT CONDITION . SERVICE WAS AVERAGE . THIS IS AN ENJOYABLE CD TO LISTEN TO . JOHNNY HODGES ,ON HIS SAX. , PUTS THAT SPECIAL TOUCH TO THE LAWRENCE WELK ORCHESTRA . YOU CAN'T GO WRONG IN BUYING THIS CD ."
2,Mistaken,"Note that this dictionary is NOT by Ludwig Wittgenstein. The cover has a quote by him and no mention of any other authors or editors, so it's easy to see how the confusion would arise. If you need a dictionary for a junior high or early high school student, then it seems to be a nice little resource including measurement conversion tables, the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, world maps, tidbits on all 50 states, biographies on all the United States presidents, and some information on the solar system. However, those of you trying to find the actual dictionary, ""Dictionary for Elementary Schools,"" that Ludwig Wittgenstein edited and wrote the preface for, know that this is not it. The only source I know of for that in English is the preface he wrote included in ""Philosophical Occasions, 1912-1915."""
4,convenience (with a flaw),"( I bought from Amazon. )I've had the base & one remote sensor for four months. Temperature is accurate and I haven't had to replace the batteries yet. The large display is easy to read.It's nice to know the outside temperature before getting up & dressed.The flaw: The tenths of a degree position on the base unit's local temperature is faulty. That wasn't worth the trouble to return & replace, but it's a sign of sloppy quality control."
3,Good Until The Infestation,"I've had the 1457 and an indoor receiver for a little over a year. It work fine until ants nested in it. I assume they entered through the holes in the bottom. It no longer works. I may buy another though, as I was happy with it until it quit."
1,Worked Superbly for 60 days,"Bought the primary and then two remote transmitter thermometers. Was really pleased with the main receiver and its ability to monitor the highs and lows at the primary and then at the two additional remotes. Then after about two months, the display kept fading and fading, and even with new batteries, the display will come up for a few seconds and fade entirely. Am very disappointed, will now start the task of contacting the company or Amazon to see what kind of replacement I can get, although once bitten by a product, I generally do not return to it."
5,Very Sturdy,This bench feels very secure and does not flex under my extra weight. The extra cost for this heavy duty model is well worth it. And I was surprised that there was very little assembly required. This is an excellent purchase.
1,Are they nuts?!,"Why on earth is this thing $133?! I haven't bought it and at this price anyone who does is a)clinically insane or b)has a lot of money to burn. If it's ""b""...send some my way!"
5,LPN is the greatest!,"Lee Press-On and The Nails are one of my favorite bands and this C.D. proves their greatness even more to me. I've had a chance to see them live a couple of times and they are fantastic!! This C.D. was recorded live which makes me think I'm right along with them everytime I play it.This band is so tight, everything about them is amazing and this C.D. is by far their latest and greatest one!! I recommend them highly to anyone who has a taste for good music."
4,Great Steamer,"This set has held up well. I've steamed fish, dumplings, little buns, and all sorts of Asian style foods in here and it fits perfectly into a medium sized wok.Steamed live crabs as well, but a stock pot is far sturdier and the crabs die faster and don't suffer as much."
2,Get Used to Shabby Items from China,"Warped trays overlap to the point there is not complete coverage on one ""side"" (no matter how you position the trays). Any more you just do not see good scores for cheap made items from China. This is no exception. American made craftsmanship died in the early 1980's. We pay the price for corporate greed in more ways than one. Sad, sad, sad . . .I gave it two stars because it is functional, but cheaply made and OVER PRICED. It pains me to think that someone in China got paid a wooden token to make this. It should have cost mo more than $9.99 tops! I buy American made when I can, but some items just are not made in America. This is one of them."
5,Great buy,I had this for almost 3 years now and I have to say that is has been a great buy. I even left one on top of the hot stove top and it got a little singe but it is still doing fine.
5,Bamboo Steamer Set,Works very well. Is as good as the last one I had that Iused for over 20 years. Gave it to my kid.
4,Nice product but directions needed,"real nice product, works great but only reason I am giving it 4 stars is that it should include basic instructions and some recipes..."
4,Bamboo Steamer,"It works very well, BUT... It smells like bamboo every time you use it. I have tried washing it with lemon juice and even left it outside in the sun for a week, with no luck. Any suggestions?Other than that, it's a wonderful way to cook. My husband loves the steamed food."
2,Is this any more convenient than any other?,If this requires an hour long soaking before use how convenient to use is it? I'll agree that it is a good product but It doesn't seem that it's going to be a quick and easy dinner.
4,L-O-V-E it!,"I haven't stopped using this product since it showed up at my door. In looking for a way to cook delicious food without turning my oven on during the hotter months, I turned to the steamer. It is incredibly simple and easy to use. I can cook all my courses in this vessel while only turning on one burner in my house. Fish, vegetables, and any kind of dumpling you can imagine fit easily within the layers. I use parchment paper when cooking things that I imagine would stick and that has made clean up a breeze. The only concern I had was storage as I have limited space in my cupboards, but I have found that separating the pieces have made it that much more storage friendly. So far it seems to be durable after fairly heavy use. A quality product that no kitchen should be without."
2,Quality is a bit lacking...,"I have to say that I am a bit disappointed with the quality of this steamer. For example, the walls (which are made of thin layers of bamboo bonded together) are a bit rough and unevenly bonded, and fastened into their circular shape with copper wire. Thin strips of bamboo are interwoven to form the base of each of the steamer sections. Today, I bought a Typhoon brand one (8"" diameter), which, by contrast, is really nicely made of all natural materials, has a base made of thicker pieces of bamboo rather than thin strips, and cost less. Of course, the Norpro one will do the job and if you need a larger steamer, it should work just fine--I am just overall happier with the Typhoon product."
4,Great album!,"At this period Duke Ellington was just a little too wild and modern, but apart from some flights of fancy on the part of the Ellington orchestra and not having enough tunes by others, this is a terrific record. The main problem with the record is that it is far too short. Otherwise the music quality and the sound recording is fantastic."
3,Functional... barely,"This is probably the cheapest keyboard I have ever used. I knew that going in, though - the only reason I bought it was that I was building a desktop PC with a wireless keyboard and I needed a wired one for setting up the machine, as well as if something goes horribly wrong in the future. For those purposes, it worked fine. I would not use this keyboard on a regular basis (it feels like it would break in weeks). Also, the PS/2 cord is very short, limiting placement options unless you have an extension cable."
3,Solid product- limited useful life,"Positive: Solidly built, heats evenly or unevenly if dialed in that way using via adjusting the burners.Cons: 2-3 years of use before the before coating deteriorated.Consideration: The nonstick surface is easy to clean, but the shape made it awkward to clean (and I have an oversized sink)"
3,Depressing Story,"This was a definite downer. There is very little to be happy about in this book. I thought it would be a good southern story with some optimism, but there was only unhappiness throughout the entire book."
4,The Catts family trilogy,"I fully enjoyed My Brother Michael, loved the voice, the story, the characters. I had also brought home from the library a second book by Owens, The Schooling of Claybird Catts. I started reading it and quickly lost interest because it goes over the same ground as My Brother Michael, but from a different point of view. Then I noticed that there's a third book, Myra Simms, which again is another point of view of the same story. That's a bit much of the Catts family. I'd like to read something fresh from this author. I see she has another book, American Ghost. I'll give it a try."
4,Release,"Release being Pet Shop Boy's 12th album and their 8th album of entirely new music and was a big departure from their prior albums. This album is a more guitar based album and featured Johnny Marr from the Smiths. Hits on this album were ""Home and dry"" and ""I get along"". The cd booklet is quite nice photographs of flowers, easy to read lyrics and an informative list of whom plays what on the album. 4/5."
4,Progression vs. Regression,"From the moment I heard the opening notes of 'Home and Dry' I was hooked on this album. To this day, I cannot play this album without getting goosebumps during the opening 25 seconds. Personal whimsy aside, this is an excellent album. Sure, it is lacking the 'stomping disco' elements of previous releases but hey, the singles are sure to have remixes of that nature. The only reason I would rate this album under five stars is that two of the most promsing tracks, 'I Get Along' and 'Birthday Boy' fall a little flat with repeated listens. All the other tracks are spectacular, my personal favorites being 'London', 'Here', 'You Choose', and the previously mentioned 'Home and Dry.'Lyrically, 'Release' is not the strongest album in the Boys' aresenal, but Neil has never sounded better...Sure, it is different than almost everything else they have released, but in my totally useless opinion, it's a step in the right direction.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
2,Think twice before you buy !,"I've been a PSB fan for all my life, but this time I was very disappointed. This album does not have the true PSB sound. The keyboard and rhythm is gone. Where is Chris Lowe? It sounds like Neil's solo album. Overall it is all slow and it didn't move me at all."
2,Letdown,"This cd is far, far below the quality I expected from this typically superb duo. As one of the few straight men to rave about the PSB, I felt extremely disappointed in the material as well as the clipped audio in many songs. I listen to this band to cheer up, wake up, and feel young. This ""release"" put me to sleep. It gets 2 stars only out of respect for their talent. This one sucks, so save your money."
2,Please Release Me!,"Pet Shop Boys used to burn up the dance floors of every club I worked in and frequented during the 80's and early 90's. And what fantastic re-mixes were spun off from their work.When you first hear HOME AND DRY you think you are in for an enlightened new groove that will carry you away like before. Sadly,they never get off the ground and the tracks get more clouded and more mushy as we listen. Sorry folks, but after the anthem ""GO WEST"" the Pet Shop Boys got lost.Clever packaging is not enough."
4,Damned good!!,"I was surprised by this PSB album ... and the reason for that is because it never occurred to me beforehand how a lot of their tunes are indeed influenced by The Beatles. This album especially proves that point. In my opinion, it's the guys' ""artiest"" release to date .......... and besides, you've GOT to admire a band that has the downright balls to record a song about a personal gay encounter between the singer and Eminem in his hotel room after an Eminem concert!!!This one is highly recommended in my book!"
4,Get it !,"Wonderful/refreshing return to earlier PSB roots (ex. Behaviour). I really like how the duo has remained fresh and inventive over the last few years. I guess that's why they're still my favorite group. I like singing along with Neil, and this disc is just the perfect thing for that! It has all the trademark PSB touches-- lyrics, the right blend of electronic/""live"" instruments, and so much meaning in the way each song is constructed. I would've given the disc 5 stars, but I do like the high energy songs the group has released in the past. I guess that's what remixes are for."
3,It's missing something.,"Okay, it's not like the songs on this album are actually BAD. So I have to give this album three starts for a worthy effort. It's just that this album is missing something serious. That 'something' is ENERGY. You know, all-out, full-bore barnstormers along the lines of 'Opportunities', 'Suburbia', 'Always On My Mind', and 'Yesterday, When I Was Mad'. In other words, songs that make you wonder why so many people think only hard rock goes with fast cars or motorcycles. This album has nothing of the sort. Now a few ballads is not such a bad thing. But an album full of them just doesn't do it for me."
3,ok....so its not the best. BUT damn good nonetheless.,"not my favorite PSB offering. i have all of them. all of them. tons of them.this album is probably my least favorite of all.that said...there are some absolutely glorious songs here that make this purchase well worth it.if you are a PSB fan, you must, obviously, get this.if your new to them, i'd recommend Behavior or Very as a good jumping off point."
3,The Release and the Letting Go,"Chris Lowe and Neil Tennant suddenly started acting very grown up on their 8th ""Release."" Gone are the pumping dance anthems. NoWest End Girls, noNew York City Boyeither. ""Samurai in Autumn"" comes close, but this is a much more downtempo affair than most PSB fans would be used to.However, that doesn't mean the songs are bad. ""Home and Dry"" is as good as anything they've ever done, and the sardonic dream of meeting Eminem (""The Night I Fell In Love"") is gently funny. ""You Choose"" joins the Boy's odes to love as one of the best, as well. Plus one cool anti-love song with ""Love is a Catastrophe.""Unfortunately, after awhile, you really start longing for something of that old flavor. Please, you ask, where isIt's a Sinor even a clever remake alaWhere The Streets Have No name/Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You? But all you get is art, when you really wanna dance. It makes ""Release"" an average PSB album, mainly for the faithful only. 2006'sFundamentalgot the groove back."
2,YIKES!,"Having been a PSB fan since the mid-eighties, I was terribly disappointed with this. I waited with anxiety at the door of my favorite store for this. I bought the 2-cd special edition and there are only 2 good songs on both disks combined ""Home & Dry"" and ""Sexy Northerner"". They stared going down hill on their last effort ""Nightlife"" with badly written cliche tunes about closeted homosexuality. That album started off fantastic and ended horribly, while this continues the horrible pattern. It is great Neil & Chris are exploring their many talents with softer acoustic music, but the lyrics are juvenile at best. They were on a great roll with Behavior, Very, Bilingual and stopped short there. I do look forward to their second greatest hits collection to hit later this year. Maybe the singles from this album will sound better mixed amongst classic treasures from Very, Bilingual and Nightlife."
2,Dave's Opinion,"This album was ruined by dubbed-in music in most songs. Simply RUINED. On most songs for example, the music is so loud, the songs can't be heard. Had I known that, I certainly would not have bought it. I don't like it.David"
2,most of the music is on another album that I already had,"Make sure you check if you already have the same music on another of their albums. Ididn't, but I did."
5,Love the Wiggles,"Our 2 1/2 year old could listen to this album over and over and over. She loves it and it gets her dancing and singing. Beware of the Wiggles though, they will get into your head and never get out. That said, we are so happy with this album and we listen to it in every room of the house and in the car. I hear my little girl singing the songs as she goes to bed which is sweet."
3,This doesn't work well for me,"I've had this for several months, and I use it about twice a week on my feet while I'm showering. It hasn't softened up at all and doesn't foam for me, and I tend to not use it because it's unpleasant. I think I'm going to look for a different pumice stone and give up on this one."
2,Not what I expected.,"I was expecting something with a little more substance. This is like a coarse piece of foam. There's nothing stoney about it. It's decent I guess at removing dry skin, but I thankfully do not have thick calluses like some people do so it wasn't that big a deal to me.. If you have serious skin damage on your feet, this is NOT for you."
4,Does what it should,Works great so far. I have only used it once and could tell my feet were softer and smoother. It is goo.
4,Miracle Stone,This product is an okay product but I'm not sure where the miracle comes from. It works much better on your elbows and knees then it does on your feet.
2,I don't understand...,I really don't understand what the product can be used for. I tried it on my feet but I have a lot of better things than this one from before. I thought it should make my feet better but perhaps I misunderstood.
4,"Good, but not as good as I expected","It took me a week after reading this book to process my thoughts on it. It was a good book, definitely a great present for a young woman, but I ended up being disappointed by the book overall. I couldn't help feeling that the editor of this book did a real slash job on some of these essay to keep them at the 2-4 pages alloted each author. Many of them, including some from writers whose style I am familiar with, seemed very disjointed and thrown together. Many of the paragraphs seem completely unrelated, jumping from one idea to the next without any connection. It made it difficult to read, and took away from the essays.There are some good essays in there, Joyce Carol Oates' and surprisingly Julia Stiles' were two of my favorites out of the whole book."
2,defenitely NOT comfort,"I hate it - you think you found something what you were looking for, like COMFORTABLE BRA, but what you get is tight synthetic bra that cuts into your shoulders and stresses you out."
3,Doesn't fit well,"I bought this bra because of its great reviews. Pre-pregnancy I was a 36A bra size, so I bought the small size when I found out I was pregnant. 7 months pregnant, I am now a 36B and the small is toooo tight! After washing, it is extremely uncomfortable until I stretch it out after a few wears. It looks pretty when I wear it, and the clasp is easy to undo, but it's just too constrictive. Perhaps I would have liked it in a bigger size."
1,Sizing is ridiculously small and inaccurate.,"According to the sizing chart, my size, a 38D should fit in the Large category. This a joke! I doubt it would even fit a 32A. I am returning it to the seller. Also, this seller took more than 2 weeks to get my order to me. It says 4-7 days shipping time, but they took almost a week to process my order. I would get sized in a store before purchasing this online."
4,It's actually attractive!,"I haven't purchased a lot of bras for nursing but of the ones I have, this one is very comfortable and it's even, dare I say, sexy. It works very well underneath racerback tank tops. Also, the 'one-handed attachment' for each side really only takes one hand. Buy a size larger than you normally would. It's narrow."
3,Runs insanely SMALL...even for smaller-breasted women!,"Other reviewers aren't kidding...these run INSANELY small! I went with a medium size to make sure it would fit...and even that was too small! So I bought a large.I'm a slim person, and pre-preg was a ""barely A"" size...post-preg I grew maybe a cup size, but a LARGE??This bra is okay, but I'm still looking for a better option."
2,ZERO support for larger cupped ladies.,"I was looking for a soft-cup bra to sleep in while I am nursing my newborn (we co-sleep). I bought this in my size, according to the size chart. It was a tad too small (meaning my breasts semi came out the top, but not by much). I wear a 34H, so I have a regular size band, but a large cup. This bra gives zero support! Nothing. Nada. I may as well just wear a tank top to bed instead, and save the money.Back to the drawing board!"
3,Runs Small,I received this when I was 8 months pregnant. I ordered a medium and think it is fits a little snug around the ribs. I would definitely order a size up next time!!
3,"Comfortable and Supportive, except when it breaks","The fabric 'corner' that was sewn to one of the cups of this bra tore within 3 weeks of receiving it, and I had to hand sew it back together. I don't think I was that hard on it, or that I wore it that much within those three weeks! Gave 3/5 stars because other than that it is a nice, comfortable, very supportive nursing bra. I think the cups should be attached better though. Maybe mine was just a fluke?"
2,Very small.,"This bra is very small. I wear a small size, and got this in a medium. Even a medium size was a bit too tight and uncomfortable."
4,A great sleep bra,"I wear a size 40DD nursing bra, and I purchased this bra in size XL. It really is very comfortable: it doesn't bind, the fabric breathes and the shoulder straps don't cut into my shoulders. However, the stretchiness of the fabric makes this a rather loose-fitting bra; I probably could have gone with the large size instead of extra-large. I would certainly never wear this bra while exercising! I've found it's best as a sleeper bra. It holds nursing pads in very well, even when lying down and rolling over repeatedly, and it's the most comfortable bra I own to sleep in. Buy something with more support for during the day, but use this one at night."
1,Very Disappointed!!!,"I bought this bra relying on the good reputation of Medela and was very disappointed. It is uncomfortable, unadjustable, and the shoulder straps ride up very high, making your already limited choice of outfits even more so. As the model in the picture isn't wearing any breast pads, you can't see how this bra does an extremely poor job at concealing them from the public. I also found that, because it must go on over your head, it was difficult putting it on. I am a 36B and the large was uncomfortably tight. It's like a complicated sports bra, without the support. It was even more difficult to refasten the hooks. Don't waste your money! Go to ... and order a catalog, they have a huge selection. I recommend the ""sleep-bra"" with crossover design for it's easy access design, comfort, and light but perfect support!"
2,Size is all wrong!,"I ordered the size that not only covered my present cup size (at nine months along), but also showed to be big enough for when I am nursing. This was NOT an accurate description of cup size. I read reviews where women stated that the size wasn't accurate, but assumed that since I was ordering a Large- which covered up to a DD, and I am presently a C, it wouldn't be a problem. This bra JUST fits (albeit a little snugly) right now. It definitely won't work when I am nursing.Trying to return it without paying shipping wouldn't work- incorrect size makes it sounds like I made a mistake in ordering, and I was going to have to pay the shipping. I decided to purchase other nursing bras AFTER trying them on first!"
2,Not enough support,"This is a very soft bra, but at 38E once my milk came in, it wasn't enough support at the band. I really can only sleep in this and nothing else. It hurts my back if I wear it during the day."
3,"Comfortable, but not as flattering as other bras.","I like this bra fine for wearing around the house. I prefer my Bravado bodysilk nursing bra for going out in the world. The bravado has a more flattering shape and thinner, better placed straps."
4,Not bad,Not a bad nursing bra. The best I have found so far. The fabric is pretty thin (reminds me of the top part of a pair of nylons) and the straps are a little weird. They are really wide for my small frame and fold over on each other. Wears like a sports bra. Better than anything else I have but still searching for something I love.
3,"Supportive, but fabric makes me hot!","It's a good bra, it's comfortable. However, the fabric makes me sweat! I have the Medela seamless bra, and it does not make me as hot as this one does. I guess wear this in the winter time.It looks like a sports bra, but don't go try running with it on. It is not supportive enough. However, this bra is great for skin to skin contact with baby, because the entire flap folds down."
5,Great sleep bra,I am very large chested and I love this bra as a sleep bra. It is not supportive enough to wear outside of the house but it is perfect for sleeping and wearing around my house. I am a 38DDD and other sleep bras are not big or supportive enough but this one is comfortable and provides the perfect amount of support for sleep.
4,Nice sleep bra,"I love the fit and comfort of this sleep bra. I got a medium. Normally I wear a 32D in most bras, but having read some of the reviews, decided to size up a bit, and I'm glad I did. I like having cups that drop away because it makes it much easier to nurse a newborn while side-lying. Pull-down cups are popular on sleep bras, but the cups on that style always seem to ride up and get in the way when nursing a tiny one (especially when your arm is up as in a side-lying position). The only drawback to this bra is that it is a pullover style, however, that does make it super soft and comfy for sleeping/lounging because there's no hardware to poke or irritate. Perfect for early days when milk is coming in and breasts are engorged, and for holding nursing pads in place."
2,medela nursing bra,This bra runs very small and is not manufactured in larger sizes. It looks like it would be comfortable but it is way too tight.
2,Size is totally off!,I am a 38B and according to the size chart I should be a Large. It is very tight and uncomfortable. There is no nipple coverage. I won't be buying Medela anymore.
2,not great for large chested girls (only to sleep),this bra is not very supportive if you have a large chest (D or above) best for sleeping if you are this size. It is comfortable
3,works for larger sizes,"I was a 40DDD pre-pregnancy and I hesitated to buy this because I wasn't sure it would fit. When I went into labor nearly a month early and hadn't yet gotten around to buying any nursing bras, I had my mom pick this one up for me and bring it to the hospital. I just figured it would be better than nothing, but I have to say I'm pretty impressed with it. The material is quite soft, stretches endlessly, and nothing digs anywhere. Clips are easy to use and it provides decent support to my large chest, so I'm sure it would be even better for women who are smaller. It comes up high in front so things stay in place while sleeping. Also doesn't cause the dreaded ""uniboob"" that I so dislike. I will purchase some other more substantial bras, but this one will definitely still see plenty of use."
3,Is very tight and gives me a shoulder pain,"The fabric is very soft and gives a lot of support. Unfortunately, I wear it very little because it is very tight and gives me a shoulder pain.According to the Medela bra size, I am in the medium size. But I should have bought a large size because it gets small after wash.I wash in the machine and let it air dry. I am going to try Bravado Designs Body Silk Seamless Nursing Bra."
2,a couple of disadvantages,"I have to admit I was disappointed in this one. Most importantly, it is hard to close the snaps back into place with one hand after nursing ...you definitely want to be able to do that if you're still holding the baby. Then, instead of two separate cups this bra only has one front panel, so that if you unhook just one side, the other breast is semi-exposed as well. If you're anything above a B-Cup, this bra does not give you a whole lot of support. It is comfortable enough, but shrinks in the wash and is then difficult to put on, since you have to pull if over the head.It would help if Medela Bras didn't come in sealed boxes and you could see it and try it on before buying."
5,great for the first weeks after delivery!,"I have been using the bra for a week now, and it is very comfortable. I really like the way the front of it comes down for feedings. I have been able to open it with one hand but it is harder to close with one hand.I would not recommend this product if you are hoping to have enough support for normal daily wear. It has been great for the beginning weeks at home with the baby. I bought three!!I have washed it twice and it is still in good shape."
4,Order a size larger!,"Very comfortable, nice stretchy & high quality fabric. However -- be sure to order a size larger (!), even if you follow the sizing chart. I fell between small/medium, ordered a medium, and way too small. Had to send back (to Canada!) -- lots of extra hassle. But the large fits (still even slightly small, could have gone extra large). Comfortable to sleep in and enough support for daily wear."
3,Not for the well-endowed,"I wear a size f or something in regular bras. The Xl fit ok, but it's not very supportive and not for going out in public unless I wear a large t shirt and am just running to the store. I grab the medela sleep bra before this one when lounging around the house. It's more comfortable, although I do like that this one has snaps."
2,Not good for big breast,"First of all, the size chart doesn't represent correct fitting. According to this chart I needed size L, but it was way too small, so I had to get size XL.This bra looked like a great bra, but after wearing it for a few days I realized that it actually doesn't support my breast and my back was hearting a lot because of that. It's very thin too, so I cannot imagine wearing it outside the house.Even though the material feels soft and nice, it's so difficult to put on (if you have nails it's even harder!).I don't recommend this bra for women with big breast, and I think it way overpriced too."
2,Size and...stains?,I followed all the websites advice on this and bought the size I was during pregnancy a 36D/Large. After I gave birth my boobs stayed about the same for a few weeks then whamo! I exploded to a 38DD. It's been 6 months and despite everyone saying my boobs would shrink back into oblivion after my milk settled I'm still huge. Needless to say this bra is WAY too small now. Still I had many issues with it from the beginning. For one it is a raging pain to get on. A lot of twisting and pulling. I would definitely prefer a bra with hooks. The biggest thing was one night I leaked all over this beast. I washed it immediately but the milk stained the bra. Something like a grease stain . I have no idea why but there it is. Bottom line for me is this wasn't this amazing bra that I had heard.
3,Blue Days,"""Another Kind of Fire"" is an independent release that is worth seeking. Edie Carey's musical style is folk/pop. Most of her tempos are softer and the songs are melodic. She has a lovely voice, at times hushed, which makes her always sound intimate and personal. ""The Night"" has an airy chorus with a nice build and strong lyric, ""You want it two ways; Are you in or out? You want to see the beauty, but you can't kill these doubts; These blue days are gonna show you how to fly."" ""My Heart"" has a catchy melody and threatens to rip into a great track, but the arrangement is a bit timid. The opener ""Hollywood Ending"" and the title track are also strong songs. The major drawback to ""Another Kind of Fire"" is a lack of pep. Carey shows that she has the talent as a songwriter and performer to make a great album, but she needs a band who can pulse energy into her songs. This one is pleasant. Enjoy!"
2,Part did not fit,"I ran the year, Make and model and the system verified it was the correct part. When I received it, and removed the old one, it was not the correct part. Had to send it back, but at least Amazon payed for the shipping.Little things are bound to happen when you buy online, I still love ya Amazon.."
2,My least favorite of the J. Michael Straczynski Spider Man series,Of all the books up to this point this is my least favorite of the J. Michael Straczynski Spider Man series. :-/ The whole Loki tie in just didn't do it for me and it took me awhile just to finish this book. I'm hoping the series finishes out strong though! I've loved every one up till this point!
4,Great old skool,"Kool G is an old skool N.Y. champ and always has been, the only reason I didn't give this a 5 is cause it doesn't have enough trax from 4,5,6 which is one of his best, that album really showed how he changed with the times and always stayed a step above the competition. Before and since the symphany with Big Daddy, Master Ace and Craig G, he's a rap legend whether you like his personal life or not.He's the original gangster story telling rapper, definitely an inspiration for the late great PUN.If you love rap you need to hear Kool G Rap."
1,Karrine Steffans Baby Daddy,"As if yall don't know, Karrine Steffans aka ""Superhead"" baby daddy is none other than Kool G Rap aka 'Nathaniel Wilson'. I can not support his album for the simple fact he beat up Karrine and abandon his son Naiim! Yeah, I used to listen to his music until I read Karrine's book and if you look at the last picture where she and her son took together you can tell that damn fool had beat her ass!!!! I was in a domestic dispute before, but damn! I can't support this man, if someone is going to hit and nobody didn't hit his moms ( Rip Mrs. Wilson). So why rate his music when he did all of this and don't take care of himself? The reason I said it because this fool thought about a luscious lifestyle instead of his health. Kool have seizures folks! Instead of all that money he was spending he shoulda took care of himself a little better, instead of Karrine! Whoever read this review hit me an email at daradiant1@yahoo.com, peace."
1,hey,this guy beats his wifes he's ugly his music is garbage he looks like garabage he acts like garbage he is a wife beater and what i read about him in a book a mean jerk don't buy his music and support stupidity and if u still want to buy his records how would like it if he treated your mom like that? his music sounds like crappp_ too
4,Neo-Rockabilly SUNshine,"I can't get as excited about this as the previous reviewer but it's great rockabilly by today's standards. An extra star is awarded for the original material which is true to the genre and doesn't strive to glorify itself, like Brian Setzer's self-indulgent posturing. A star is deducted for too little playing time - a CD should be at least half again the length of an LP. By the way, if the inflated price frightens you you can get this CD from texasmusicroundup.com for as little as $10."
4,Rugrats Grown Up,"My kids love the baby Rugrats and this seems to be a little less interesting for them, though I found the message of the two stories to be very good."
4,A goody for this ONLY episode,It was great to see the kids grown up. The episodes now suck. So the movie is best for the one time grown up experience. I still love the babies!!
5,a must read,"Most books and publications focus on the bodybuilding side of weight lifting. This book is all about getting more explosive power, not about growing muscle. Unfortunately, when most people think about strength training, bodybuilding techniques come to mind. This is one of not many books that focus on lifting for purely functional purposes. You will not be doing any concentration curls 10 sets of 10 reps with programs offered by this book. Instead you'll be doing dynamic lifts that are guaranteed to increase your ""core"" body explosive strength."
3,a basic primer on the o-lifts,"The book is ok, but it seems like it would be a good book forintroduction, or high school students. I couldn't see anyonelearning to do the lifts from this book, its definately nota how to or substitute for real coaching. the title soundslike its trying to hook in people but the book is a basicprimer on the o-lifts."
2,Explosive Lifting.....Boring!,"Thankfully I found this book at the library and didn't have to pay for it as it would have been a waste of money. I can't think of another book that presents the topic of weightlifting in a more boring format.The DVD reminded me of a 1940's military training film - you know the type. The droll, non-emotive delivery that will put you to sleep by the first exercise.The whole premise is flawed. Why ""Explosive Lifting for Sports""? If you are going to learn the Oly lifts then these are not SPECIFIC exercises for any sport except lifting! Just learn the lifts and get good at them - focus on speed of movement and form. If you are an athlete then maybe the extra strength will help - maybe not.If you want to learn the Oly lifts get a decent book that has some life and enthusiam to it's presentation. ""Weightlifting Encyclopedia"" is a good one. But this book here, well, just get it at the library if you really must."
1,disintegrated,I bought this for my Mom for xmas last year and within days of using it it began to lose pages. the entire english section of the book is now a collection of loose pages which makes it very hard to use and keep track of. Now quite recently the binding has completely disintegrated so there is nothing holding it together. It is a great resource but the binding issues need to be addressed. I would return it just on principle but it is just too much trouble for a 10 dollar book. Maybe the hard bound version would have been a better choice.
2,Dictionary fell apart - defective binding,"After a few months of moderate use, individual pages started falling out. A few weeks later, pages starting falling out in clumps, and the dictionary became unusable. Other than that, I have to say that from a content perspective, I like it. It's got good examples and I've been able to find English translations for 95% of the words I look up. This must be a ploy by the publisher to get me to buy the hardcover edition. There's no other reason why someone would manufacture a reference book that couldn't sustain much more than a thousand look-ups before disintegrating."
3,Okay compact desk dictionary but not pocket dictionary,"This is not a pocket dictionary, as others have noted. It is a compact desk dictionary larger and thicker (the paper is a bit thicker) than the Webster's New World Italian Dictionary (MacMillan). Oxford may have its own advantages, but the Webster's has a few more entries and gives IPA pronunciation for Italian words (very precise, with stress and open vs. closed 'o's). A true pocket dictionary is Langenscheidt's Inglese-Italiano Italian-English, (c) 2010 Arnoldo Mondadori Editore S.P.A. Milano, ISBN 978-88-04-55452-3 which I finally found in Rome airport. It's 3x4.5x1.5 inches in a plastic jacket."
4,"Great price, look great.","I purchased these suitcases because I was tired of trying to locate mine amid the thousands of black suitcases around the airport carousel. Shipping was fab, product is fab. They've been to San Francisco, Bahamas and Belize and still look pretty new!"
3,Not revised enough,I first thought this is a real revision of the older book of the two respectful professors but after I received the book I found it just a newer print and not a revised print. If I had to comment I would comment on the original book as being an excellent book on power system stability and modeling. I used it a lot in my MS degree studies but again I will never forget my shock when I received the new print. Now I have two copies on my shelf.
1,too basic for most people,"this book should really be titled ""Buying Insurance."" there is almost nothing in it about annuities, which is the primary reason i bought the book. there is no explanation of guaranteed vs. current annuity rates, different provisions like MVA, etc. it did help me out with a couple of insurance topics, but if you are really sitting down and getting ready to actually make decisions or pruchase insurance/annuities, this book doesn't even begin to get you prepared for the real world. it's good bathroom reading for someone just curious about the subjects, but not a very practical book with real money/lives on the line. if you're a do-it yourselfer, or like to be prepared before meeting with financial professionals, i think you almost have to buy a few different books, one specializing in each subject."
4,The Complete Idiot's Guide to Buying Insurance and Annuities,"For the insurance poor! If insurance is greek to you, this is a great book to have. It provides great simple explanations and illustrations. For the readers ease they included ""jargon alerts"" so you don't have to have a dictionary to read the book and ""insider tips"" to advice you even more. Makes for a great reference tool."
4,"Good, general guide",This is a good investment if you are looking at establishing financial security and your plan includes insurance coverage. This will prepare you with some good common sense tips and easy to understand explanations. It is a quick read but worthwhile if you are totally new to this area.
1,Taylor Wireless Temp,"The one I received the wireless did not work. Sent unit back to Taylor receved two units from taylor,one wireless will not work the second works some of the time. It doesnt pay to returm them. Will not buy Taylor unit again."
1,For Short Distances Only,I purchased this device with two remote sensors to monitor temperature in two adjacent rooms of my instrument shop. The intended distance was 25 feet-well under the 100 foot specification. The intervening walls are wooden studs and sheet rock and there is little or no interfering electronics here. The connection keeps fading in and out at these distances. Further testing indicates that the system only works within about 10 feet.
1,Taylor oven thermometer,I emailed taylor about a thermometer I have that no longer works. These thermometers have a lifetime warentee. they have not answered emails. would you trust them anything. good luck. taylor sucks...
5,Great buy.,I love this Taylor produce. I will buy another soon. It has a wired lead to an addiional sensor that I use to measure a hot water tank.
4,FFloyd Cramer Piano Magic 2,"As a youing lady, I really enjoyed listening to Cramer music. A couple of tunes in particular (not on this CD) brings back a lot of memories; boyfriend memories that I haven't thought of in many-many years."
4,Produced by Souled Out; Cover of EBTG,"I just read some of the earlier reviews. Contrary to what some thought, this was not produced by Ben Watt, nor EBTG; the song itself was written by EBTG, and HAS already been sung by Tracey Thorn (do you not remember the track on the 1993 EP ""I Didn't Know I Was Looking For Love"" and 1993's ""Home Movies""?). This version is not the original UK release; this copy is missing the epic Trouser Enthusiasts' mix"
5,"I don't know a word in spanish, but I love this music",Once I have seen a clip on youtube and since that I love Babasonicos. Have to learn spanish :) I hope it is spanish :)
4,Good alternative music from Argentina,"I was looking for some good Spanish bands that were not too poppy or too disco and I found them hard to find. I finally sampled some music from Babasonicos and really liked the sound of this band from Argentina. They have their own ""alternative"" style with intermitent fast and slow guitar. The music also varies from an aggressive punk to an almost western style. The lyrics are not groundbreaking but the music has a strong sound and supports itself."
5,Wonderful Sign,"Took a little longer than expected to receive the sign because it was out of stock, but it is absolutely fabulous! The colors are magnificent and fit in with my diner theme just wonderfully! I'm very pleased with the Seller and the Sign."
3,Could be better,"I was really looking forward to the Pet Shop Boys new CD but it has not lived up to my expectations. Neil and Chris were smart to work with the mighty Johnny Marr who adds some great guitar work which helps to flesh out the sometimes drab songwriting.There are some very good tracks here, Home and Dry, London, I Get along and The night I fell In love, and as usual some clever lyrics which are entertaining....The rest of the CD is nothing special. Instead of a bonus CD they should cut this down to an ep and sell it for half the price.(Despite my criticism I have not been able to get these songs out of my head for the past few days, so it can not be all that bad)."
3,Not Their Best But WorthWhile,"Release is one of those PSB albums that takes a little while to warm up to...like Nightlife and Behavior. There is nothing really wrong with any of the songs included here....""Home and Dry"" and ""I Get Along"" are nice and catchy, but ultimately left me bored. ""The Samurai In Autumn"" loses its lustre rather quickly. Having said that, there is something quite intriguing and romantic about ""The Night I Fell In Love""...its awkwardness seems to work with the track somehow. ""You Choose"" and ""London"" are gorgeous...two of their best songs. As for the bonus disc, ""Sexy Northerner"" is their most fun, hedonistic song in ages. I still cant stop playing it."
2,So-So CDs,"I wish I could hear what it is on this album that makes so many other people flip for it. I think it's mostly dated and boring. You'd never know it was recorded this century. There are 3 good, hummable songs. Thank goodness for the bonus CD, which offers a few more good tracks and makes the package worth the money. Love the Johnny Marr guitar, but where's the pulse and energy? The often lovely lyrics and beautiful sentiments aren't enough; they're robbed of their power by unmelodic, dreary music."
3,Rock on PSB,"The new PSB album in 3 years returns them to a more sombre mood. Less dancey than the last outing, Nightlife, the album needs some getting used to. But in no time, you'll be enjoying and embracing the album no less than their past efforts. Roping in ex-Smith memeber Johnny Marrs on guitar is an excellent idea cos he gives the songs an added rock edge. Don't be fooled by Home and Dry cos the rest of the album leans more towards rock than dance. Though fewer single material, there are standout tracks such as Samurai in Autumn, E-mail, Love Is A Catastrophe and Here.The limited US issue features a 2nd disc in addition to 4 different packaging. In myopinion, this is one of the best accompanying discs to an album. Containing two excellent remixes of Home and Dry, it also features some pretty strong tracks like Sexy Northener, Nightlife and more that could even be single material."
