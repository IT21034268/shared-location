2,Not sturdy,We use this paper for music charts. It always folds down when it's on a music stand. It's not sturdy at all.
4,Quality Multipurpose paper!,"Excellent paper for everyday printing from school work,menus,letters,purchase recites ETC! I do like this paper but I had expectations of better higher quality paper than my stand by PrintWorks Multipurpose Paper which I buy for $4. This HP paper was better but not by much not really worth $6.?? If you can get it for less than $6 by all means buy it."
2,Not as good quality as I expected,"I expected a better quality of paper. When I got it and put it in my printer I was shocked at how flimsy and low quality it is, I realized its because its multipurpose. I do not recommend this product!"
4,solid paper,"I needed printer paper, so I order this paper. I think it was a little different than the last batch that I bought. I would've like it to be more consistent, but it's still good paper."
3,Chintzy Paper,"Pros: Best price on Amazon for reasonable page count (500) with Prime shipping.Cons: The paper is decidedly poor quality. My Brother laser printer practically melts the stuff on the way out, creating a curly mess.Bottom Line: If any paper will do... go for it. If you plan to create presentable, polished documents... look elsewhere."
5,No issues.,I am a college student and I print a lot of papers daily. I use them in HP officejet 5500 All-in-one printer and they serve the purpose with no issues.
4,"Good quality, fair price","There is absolutely nothing wrong with this paper,if you are just into basic printing and photo copying documents for record keeping etc., then this is a perfectly economical way to do so. I have two printers, one is an epson cx9400fax, the other a lexmark z2420 compact portable and this paper works just fine in both. Here are a few tips to remember in order to get the best from your printer, 1. locate your printer in an area away from excess moisture and dust 2. store your paper in a cool dry place. 3. fan the paper before loading. 4. always load less paper than the recommended number of sheets (it's less pressure on the mechanism ) 5. load paper correctly into the printer, don't just jam or throw them in and last but not least, clean your printer periodicly, if you follow these basic steps you'll find that your printer will last longer than you expect, even if it's a cheap one ! Good luck y'all!"
5,Good paper,"I'm a stickler for brightness of paper, and this paper is pretty darn bright. Also, it's not too thin and not too thick. It's perfect for printing things for school, which is what I use it for."
1,product was open!!!!,"The overall quality of this product was good, but it came opened!!! And it certainly looked like some paper was missing!"
3,"The good is ok, but...",The good is ok and I think the price is reasonable. Just one thing that the shipper didn't input my address information in detail which caused inconvenience for delivery.
3,Not so great collection....,"....but a good band.There's one song missing from this otherwise good best of CD and that's their best tune ""Tell Me"" which was not only released as a single but a music video was made for it as well so what did the record company think by forgetting about that little ditty?"
3,"This is a ""no lose"" formula","Fastway did something that was a ""no brainer"", they assembled credible 70's era artists and recorded stereotypcial 70's era, riff based hard rocking tunes...during the 1980's new wave of Brittsih metalWhile nothing here is groundbreaking, this music will always be palatable to anybody with an affinity for this type of music or for somebody raised on 70's hard rock.""Say what you will"" is my highlight."
4,"Pretty good, but a little too dry.","This stuff is pretty good, but kind of dry, giving a leathery texture---thus 4 stars instead of 5. A little bit of moisture would have gone a long way, and I'm experimenting with rehydrating them by putting a piece of lettuce in the bag overnight (in the fridge). The results have been inconclusive as to whether this helps, with two of us having a split decision. The teriyaki flavor is perfect...not too salty as I expected, and the taste, if rated separately gets 5 stars."
1,It was moldy!,"I ordered an 8 pack of this jerkey to try and stay range grown and healthy in my eating, but when I got it, it was a disaster!First, I only got one of the 8 packs I was paying for. I can't fault this jerky, but Amazon's shipping folk for that. However, the bag had jerky in it that had a strange gray fungus growing on it!I was told this was good jerkey, but I guess I'll never know now. I may have gotten a very rare moldy pack, but I'll shy away from this stuff."
1,No Good!,Did not like the taste of the jerky. Inferior quality. Gave the remainder away. I only wish that the Oberto brand has a spicy pepper type of turkey jerky.
3,Wont run with an EU2000i generator,I got this pump because of the low power draw. I wanted to run it from my honda EU2000i generator. The pump runs fine with household AC but not from my small Honda generator. It starts for only half a second then the generator goes into overload mode. I can get the generator to start my old 1/2HP water pump but not this pump. I am very bummed out.
3,Works but LOUD,"I have this pump mounted on the exterior of a cabin along with a small pressure tank and a tankless water heater. All of the components are covered by an insulated/watertight enclosure. The pump was added to maintain consistant pressure and flow through the water heater, it does the job. The problem I have is that it is very noisy. I will try to reduce the noise by surrounding the pump with a foam insulated box."
3,Good But Not Great,"I found the book to be very easy and fast to read with lots of concrete examples of activities for the online learner. Though I understand the importance of engaging the online learner, as an instructor in the allied health field I don't feel I have the time or interest in developing games and the types of alternative learning activities suggested in the book. In allied health/science courses we need to cover an extensive amount of material, perhaps if I were teaching a course in another discipline I would feel differently.I feel that another book ""Discussion Based Online Teaching To Enhance Student Learning"" by Tisha Bender is a much better book for my situation and offered more helpful ideas (but less examples) to improve my online course."
1,this cd player absolutely sucks!,"I bought one of these, and I had a terrible time w/ it. Although it claims to have a good anti-skip, it really skips music! - even when u go walking w/ it. Mine broke within the first month of purchase - first I had some problems with the sound and then it stopped working all of a sudden. I would never recommend this product to anyone..."
4,A Classic on the 1565 Siege of Malta,"I have already reviewed a couple of books dealing with the Great Siege. I just finished Bradford's book and give it 4 stars. Eminently readable and very well researched! I read it after reading an eyewitness' account to the Great Siege, Francesco Balbis' ""The Siege of Malta - 1565."" This story contains material for an epic Hollywood movie!"
2,wow.,"wow. i read the great siege for a critical book review in world history class, and it sure was boring. it may have been the worst book i have skimmed, ever. i suppose it's because it isn't my hobbie or occupation, so i don't find the information compelling. but seriously, i couldn't stand it. i'm sure i got a horrible grade on the review too. i'll admit it looked nothing like this, but i wish it had. don't buy it. if you do, throw it away. you'll thank me. good luck to those finding an alternate, i'm sure this book won't be hard to replace."
5,Amazing story!,"I never bother to leave reviews but this book was amazing. The detailed facts, the elaborate story, and the pace at which Bradford tells the story had me hooked from the start. Simply amazing story that rarely gets attention today."
5,Rivetting,"I know a lot about the Siege,but this has the most detail yet and is very well written.It is obvious that he knows the location well"
5,"Gripping, hard to put down","A gripping story of heroism and perseverance! My wife, who hates war and military stories, couldn't put this one down.The story features a 70+ year old Maltese leader against, among others, Dragut, an 80 year old pirate fighting for the Ottoman Turks."
5,How Did Hollywood Miss This One!,"If you like such movies as ""BRAVEHEART"", ""BEN-HUR"" and ""ZULU!"", this book is for you; I couldn't put it down. Although written in the early 1960's, it remains THE landmark work on the Great Siege. The author paints such incredibly vivid pictures of the principal actors, the period and the heroic battle actions that he brings the Siege to life. While the book is a bit short on specific details for the serious historian, it more than compensates for this with its crisp, almost electric pace and non-stop action. Indeed a 1999 retelling of the Siege showed clear tribute to Bradford by aping his prose, but the result was a clumsy, ham-handed effort. Stick with this one - the original - and you won't go wrong. This is storytelling at its finest.For those with a little imagination, ""The Great Siege"" will be the best war movie you'll never see. Whether you like fiction or history, this book is sure to please."
1,This is not the original formula...........,This is not the old formula. This is the new formula with Acetaminophen and Diphenhydramine. To me it is not as effective as the old formula.
2,not as good as the maple-brown sugar flavor,"It may have 30 fewer calories per packet than the maple-brown sugar instant oatmeal, but you can really taste the missing calories. I can't even eat it hot anymore, the ""apple"" flavor is so weirdly bitter and unpleasant. It makes me hate breakfast."
2,Bought by mistake,I thought I was buying three net bags for lingerie due to the picture I saw when shopping. It turned out to be only one bag and (a rather expensive?) bottle of cleanser. I was very disappointed and returned this item.I did find the bags elsewhere for a great price and different sizes of bags were available.
4,a very aggresive and powerful record,angel hair is a very aggressive hardcore/emo band with screaming vocals and heavy guitars with a noisy and chaotic sound. angel hair broke up a while ago and this is a disography cd from them. it is a very good cd with 18 tracks. i would describe them as an aggresive/noise/thrash/hardcore/emo/and very powerful band. this is a great record for fans of such music. - mac.
4,Best Kept Secret,"I have been familar with Tonic Sol-Fa for about 7 years. If you aren't familiar with them, then buy any of their CDs, and after you become familar with them, you need to go see them live. There isn't anything like experiencing live acapella music! Tonic's sound enriches the air and creates an instant atmosphere that is hard to ignore.My favorite songs on the album are Chances, Sleep On and Grace. (Eventhough I have to say all the songs are equally enjoyable.) Boston to Beijing showcases a bright future for Tonic Sol-Fa.I won't say anything else, and I will let you create your own opinion!"
1,A poor excuse for an adventure account,"When I saw the nice cover on this book and read the exciting title, I looked forward to digging into it. Well, I hate to give such a negative review, but as I read this book, I began realizing what a waste it was. I kept reading, though, hoping against hope that it would improve. The author spends an inordinate amount of space just describing his ""amazing"" experience of discovering an account of the mutiny on a whaleship. I'm afraid that's the high point of the book. The actual information regarding the mutiny is boring and paper thin in content. I could hardly believe a reputable publisher would waste the paper and promotional dollars to distribute it. If you want a great whaleship story, read a book like Philbrick's In the Heart of the Sea."
1,Really Disappointed,"TOTAL steaming pile of writhing maggot infested... matter. Might work good if I were color blind, the image quality was trash. I actually bought this from [a local retailer]. The disappointment of having purchased this horrid product and the general horror of [local stores] inability to keep decent products on the shelf has led me to boycott their store. Why do these companies insult us by producing this kind of product and why does circuit city insult us by selling it? I just boxed it and I'm returning it tomorrow!"
1,"Not XP certified, no tech support","This is a nice little camera with tons of problems on installing if your OS is XP professional. Try to find solutions at their web site is a waste of time as the FAQ sections consists of mere three entries, none related to the webcam.Finally, once that you are upgrading or trying to upgrade the drivers, here comes a warning: ""IT IS RECOMMENDED NOT TO INSTALL THE CAMERA BEFORE INSTALLING THE DRIVERS.""I am not impressed with the technical support from this company"
5,"Oh yes, this is good","I love the way these classic albums are coming out remastered with deeper clarity now. I just got this and I'm not going to talk much about what a sweet, fantastic, funky, awesome, inspiring album this is from a rare genius in the prime of his career. I just wanted to say that this remaster brings the energy up even more, the high hats and snare has a beautiful crispness that was just not there at all in the previous muddy cd issue of this album. I am really happy with this reissue and recommend buying it even if you have the previous older version without the few extra tracks on the end. Curtis Mayfield was a one of a kind and this reissue gives even more arguement that this is perhaps his greatest album."
4,Very well done.,"This album is a classic,arguably one of his finest(although not my favorite).It opens with a nasty,funky tune called Get Down,with it's sound much like If There's Hell Below from his first solo album.Next is a lovely ballad,and in my opinion,one of the best cuts here,called Keep On Keepin On,which has wonderful lyrics about perseverance despite adversity and a beautiful melody throughout.Other stand outs:the hippy sounding We Got To Have Peace(which I personally love);Beautiful Brother of mine is cool: and the album closer is gorgeous).Not my personal favorite Curtis album,I'm not sure why(just me),but I highly recomend it for every Curtis fan."
3,Righteous limitation,"3 1/2When Mayfield grooves with conviction, hardly a human can resist its truth, and being only his sophomore solo release there is plenty of vitality to be found. However, the unfortunate side effects of mining a sound that he could distinctly claim as his own were already rearing their head in the form of self-copying. Righteous limitation"
5,Show Me Your Rocky Mountains!,I have bought several copies of this book. It is fiction but is based on the life of my husband's great-grandfather's brother. I want to give a copy to each of my 8 children so they will appreciate what their ancestors went thru in the Martin Handcart companyShow Me Your Rocky Mountains!
4,Not bad at all for the price...,"I went from having service for 6 or 8 that was at least half missing to this nice set for 12. Being the bargain hunter that I am, this seemed like the perfect price. I have, however, found that certain members of my family like their spoon bent ""just so"" and this is a source of aggravation for me. They do fine in the dishwasher, look great on the table and work for everything I do, just be aware that they may not be as heavy-duty as the set you have now if you are replacing a set."
3,Flimsier than the previous set,"This is a review for the Cambridge Silversmiths Sienna 65-Piece Flatware Set, Service for 12. I had bought a service for 8 at Target some years ago and was very happy with it, and I wanted to expand it, so I spent lots of time searching online for a service for 12. My surprise came when the package arrived. The new set has shorter handles for all the utensils and they are significantly lighter, they feel like they're about to break sometimes. It looks good, but I wish they hadn't gone all cheap on the production for the newer sets."
1,teaspoon sliced my lip and thumb,"ordered this set to match two sets I already had. While eating from a teaspon, the sharp edge of the spoon sliced my upper lip. In disbelief, I rubbed my thumb over the edge causing a cut into my skin. I emailed Cambridge and they sent me a new 12 piece set."
1,Save your money on this one,"An antique dealer becomes successful from celebrities, then trashes them to make himself a few extra bucks.How original!The author forgets how he got to where he is today. His father must be rolling in his grave.Save your money. This book is not even worth borrowing from the bookstore."
2,don't come back until you find it: tales from an Antiques Dealer,I was disappointed - I thought it would be more informative instead of self congratulatory.
1,Don't bother,"So this is how bad self-serving biographies have reached. Maybe the auther shouldn't come back until he has found a fact checker, a psychiatrist, or competent ghost writer. It is impossible to really know if he is capable of telling anything that isn't an exaggeration or written to embellish himself at other's expense.Speaking of expense, I have never seen a book like this advertise so heavily in newspapers. Of course this is at the expense of Pratt Institute, whom the author has graciously offered to donate any profits from this book. Shame on him.Oh, one more thing, in his ads, he quotes an endorsement from Bruce Wolmer, editor in chief of Art & Antiques Magazine. I would hope he realizes that Wolner works at ART & AUCTION MAGAZINE. That's typical of this book."
1,A real snoozer,"I was hoping to get a better insight into the antique business, instead I had to wade through the author's rantings and complaints about everyone in his life who crossed his path.I really don't care about your eating sandwiches with celebrities. Tell me something interesting.How would I sum up the book? It's more an autobiography about the author and a platform for his own self-serving revenge. He seems to hate everyone except his wife. Get a life.Pass on this one."
1,A waste of 17 bucks,This is probably the worst book I have read about the antiques business in the last 20 years.Save your money. The author bored me to tears with his rambling and poorly written stories.
3,A little hokie...but still worth owning,"This film features the other artists quite a bit, but still has enough John Denver to make it worth watching. It is certainly not entirely a Christmas program, and probably half of the program is filled by popular songs and native american type visuals."
5,A Wonderful Christmas Tradition,"I found this DVD in the bargain bin at Wal-Mart. Not being a particular John Denver fan (I like some of his stuff, but for the most part I can take it or leave it) I decided to take a chance.I was very pleasantly surprised. JD, Clint Black, Kathy Mattea, and Patty Loveless jammin' in the barn is the best! Personal highlights for me are Clint Black's ""Till Santa's Gone"", Kathy Mattea's ""Christ Child Lullaby"", and Patty Loveless & Kathy Mattea do a great duet of ""Someday Soon"".There are other highlights too like the JD classic ""Grandma's Feather Bed"", John singing ""Rudolph"" and ""Away In A Manger"" with a group of kids, and the bittersweet emotions evoked by John singing ""I want to Live"". Although I'm not a number one fan, the world is a much sadder place without him.If you're thinking twice about purchasing this video, think no more. It's a wise purchase that you'll enjoy for years to come. I know I have."
4,A must in the Christmas collection of any John Denver Fan,"One day in the Fort Belknap Reservation, 4 friends gathered together with the local tribespeople for an evening of songs and stories. This is the way Christmas was meant to be spent...among friends and family. Thankfully for us, the entire experience was taped, and you too can feel right at home with John and his friends. The video switches later on from the reservation, to a concert. So gather your family around, and join John Denver, Kathy Mattea, Clint Black, Patti Loveless, and the Native Americans on Montana's Fort Belknap reservation to enjoy an old-fashioned country Christmas."
5,"Scenic, musical, inspirational, very entertaining keepsake!","The Montana Sky is blue, the scenery is breathtaking, and the guest are entertaining. The spirit of the season is heartwarming. I highly recommend this video. John Denver is in his elements here as usual, he is missed."
5,What a great band.,I always loved this band and this album is just great. They were great live. I miss them a ton. :(
4,GOOD SUMMARY OF FRANKLIN'S STORIES AND SAYINGS,"Benjamin Franklin left behind a trove of writings, including wise sayings from his Poor Richard's Almanac. This small book includes many famous phrases from this series, followed by stories and quotations based on his experiences in America, England and France, some written by others. Combined together, you have a bright and interesting insight into the life and thoughts of a funny and wise man."
5,Great Tea,"This delicious Hibiscus tea has a great flavorable taste,a deep dark red in color tea.Its great. Try it for a new experience.I would recommend to you.Corona Real Hibiscus Flowers Jamaica, 8 oz."
1,Don't buy Hitachi Products,"We purchased a Hitachi 50"" t.v. from Circuit City and we've had nothing but problems with it. We purchase the 5 yr. extended warranty and on a 5 year old t.v. it's been in the repair shop every year since the 2nd year of ownership this time it's been in for the last 2+ months with no delivery in sight and no satisfaction in sight, nor can we be promised that the problems will be solved on this repair trip. Hitachi will do nothing past 1 year and the warranty people could care less. The Hitachi name no longer holds the credibility it did of years ago. BUYER BEWARE! Best to look into another brand and even an other store to check out their fine print warranties before spending hard earned money."
1,Awful - don't waste your time,I remember reading a Stuart Woods book a long time ago & liking it. I received this one as a gift & thought it would be a fine beach read. It was horrible from page one. Typical of a once decent writer now writing fast & furious to cash in on the mass paperback trade. The main character was so unbelievable - is he a superman or what? This guy can do it all without a scratch or bruise. LOTS of unnecessary sex and contrived wit that was not funny at all. PLEASE do yourselves a favor & read a classic mystery instead. Unfortunately I couldn't rate this lower than 1 star.
3,Not His Best,"This book should have been 200 pages thinner. It is boring for the first half. Woods seems to think that sex and mildly finny banter will sustain the book until the real story takes off. A smattering of plot is established and characters are introduced in the first 200 pages, but it all could have been done much more economicaly. The second half is fun, but still not up to Woods fine standard set by his previous books. If you don't have anything else to read, or if you need some light reading in between Andrew Vachss and J. L. Burke novels, this is light weight relief. Not awful, but not his best."
4,Left me pleased,"I read this book a while ago, but from my memory I know that this book was very entertaining, though not a piece of literary art. I found myself reading very late because of the thrills. I loved the use of Catalina as the setting! I love the place, and I think the author recreated the feeling that one gets when staying at the island."
4,Swimming to Catalina,The book as yet unread sits waiting for me to find time to read it. I have always enjoy Stuart woods books and am sure I will not be disappointed in this one......excellent condition when I received it
4,Love Stone Barrington!,Good Stone Barrington/gangster/love/murder book. Dino as usual is a good wing man for Stone during his life and death adventures.
4,"Fast, fun read","I thought this was a fast, fun read. The only downside I could find is that there really wasn't any suspense at the end. You knew who the bad guys were too early. Other than that, it was one of those ""stay up till 3 am to finish"" type of books."
2,Not a pageturner for me,"I'm always looking for a book that I can't book down, a who-dunnit that keeps me guessing to the end. This book was not it. Though Woods is great at fleshing out his main characters, he dragged out the mystery way to long to the point where I was disintrested."
3,Standard Stone Barrington tale,"Stuart Woods can write really good novels like ""Chiefs"", but this is not close to that quality. However, it is an entertaining and moderately exciting read. Not the author's best, but readable and enjoyable."
1,"Repasen su gramática, pero no con este libro","Hay dos ediciones de este libro en castellano y ninguna ha sido editada correctamente. En ambas, aparece la frase: ""Su madre, quien era una vaca"". Los animales no pueden recibir el tratamiento de ""quien"". Frases como: flotaban las banderas, en simple quietud, exactamente el único, en fin vino el toro, no son correctas en castellano. El verbo topetar está mal conjugado. Debería decirse Él topetea y no Él topeta. En el libro ISBN 0-14-054253-1 hay palabras mal partidas, como Bander-illeros. li-stones, par-alizado, etc. Al libro ISBN 0-590-44701-7 le faltan tildes en la portada, en las palabras traducción e inglés. (Por lo menos esta última versión cambió las palabras en las ilustraciones y las puso en castellano)"
2,Disappointed,I was hoping this would be better given the great actors. Felt like I wasted my time watching this. That's all
1,Complete disappointment,"Despite good actors and probably a good story, this movie is a train wreck. The dialog is ridiculous. Directing is ludicrous."
3,"On a cold night, something to lift a spirit and share.","The movie was OK, not quite what I expected, but then I don't much care about a lot of foul language and such. Not something I would pay to see again."
4,Pretty Good,"Of course the actors were top notch, and a pretty good story. Just something about it was not terrific. Recommend it though."
2,"Characters had some initial appeal, plot confusing","We were drawn to the actors, and liked the characters for awhile. Movie got more and more confusing after the Sigourney Weaver character dies, and ended up being very disappointing."
2,A Psychological Horror Wannabee,This horror movie begins smartly but unfortunately this psychological horror wannabe descends into a rather odd mental mind game with a twist that isn't well projected.
1,It was like the director forgot what he was doing,Was the twist ending supposed to be how it started off good and ended bad? Then I totally fell for it. Wow. Bravo! You can't possibly think that having the actors yelling for no reason means Oscar worthy performance. Or maybe you think it does. What a let down.
1,Uncredited Work as Research,"This movie, while covering an important topic, has explicitly copied the work of the James Randi Educational Foundation.The writer and producer acknowledge the research but do not credit James Randi, nor the educational foundation that much of the story is based on.I am surprised that Robert Deniro, Cillian Murphy & Sigourney Weaver would allow this important work, education & advocacy to go uncredited, especially since it is a non profit."
3,Nothing above average....,"Is it just me, or are they just not making any above average movies anymore? I usually like anything dealing with the supernatural, but this movie was just a bit too slow for me, and the plot was such that I really didn't get into any of the characters. If you have the time and nothing else to do, it won't bore you to death, and it does have a couple of really excellent actors in it. I was just hoping for more of a storyline and more intensity with the plot and the roles of the characters in the movie."
3,Coulda been better...,"It was okay. Could have been better. Mediocre acting. Strange plot, awkward dialogue. Worth watching if very bored for the day."
3,Poor ending to otherwise decent thriller,The plot is mysterious in beginning and kept me interested; but I found the ending disappointing and melodramatic. I liked Sigourney Weaver's performance - she was good.
1,Red Lights - Ignorance & bad Film taken to new heights,"I am a Sigourney Weaver fan ... the description sounded like a ""thriller"" ... hated it and especially the ending ..."
4,Entertaining and a little different!,"I enjoyed this movie... it wasn't as predictable as I expected it to be and the casting was done well. Lots of twists and turns and nothing is really what it seems, but it's not one of those useless head-bangers where at the end you still really don't know what happened. Sigourney Weaver stars as a parapsychology professor and professional debunker and Cillian Murphy is her grad student sidekick. Both seem to be haunted by psychic Simon Silver who has something of a dark past. I won't give anything away, but if you like thrillers and don't mind a little dabble with the supernatural, you'll enjoy this movie."
2,Red Lights,"this was one of the slowest , non plot, movies I have ever seen . I thought with the cast it would be worth watching , how wrong I was"
4,Great movie...worth seeing,Great movie...worth seeing Great movie...worth seeingGreat movie...worth seeingGreat movie...worth seeingGreat movie...worth seeingGreat movie...worth seeingGreat movie...worth seeing Great movie...Definitely worth seeing Great movie.
1,Turd on Wheels,"Don't bother with this massive bowel movement. It wraps itself in the mystery of profundity, but--alas--it is little more than a combination of poor writing, equally ludicrous ""turns"" of tension, and sad--stupendously sad--acting."
3,And good twist with decent story line.,"I enjoyed this film and liked that it deviated from the standard Hollywood format. The music and camera work were okay, the acting was average, the story line had a couple holes that were bothersome but in general still a good movie. The film was very good at startling you and building suspense that lead to some great scenes. All in all an enjoyable thriller with a good mystery and a twist. Certainly won't wow you but great for a rainy day."
1,Just not a good movie...period!,"A bad, uninspired movie; not Amazon's fault! Don't watch it: it took too long to go anywhere, and when it got there...whatever. Not enjoyable, even though the story had a great amount of potential."
1,Is it even worth reviewing?,"Just to warn anyone who may purchase this movie for the Robert De Niro fans in us all - don't! This movie was horrible. It was not thrilling, it was not scary. It was boring. It was impossible to care about anyone in this movie. It went on for far too long and the story left a lot to be desired. In the right hands this cast could have made a great film but this script left so much to be desired that I am surprised anyone bothered to show up for filming. Skip it. Go watch Casino for the 20th time or any other movie. I really wish I had stopped this movie after 20 minutes because it never got better. It was just a depressing and boring two hours of my life I'll never get back."
2,Muddy Concept Never Clears,"With the cast that ""Red Lights"" had, it could have been so much better than it was. The premise was full of possibilities, but the execution was poor. I had to make myself watch all the way until the end and then I wondered why I had bothered. The ending is cliche and utterly non-redeeming. Waste of a couple of hours."
4,Something sorta Original,"I thouroghly enjoyed this movie, There was even a twist at the end. I love twist. This movie should have been a hit."
3,some interesting points,some interesting points. thought provoking. true regarding how research works. husband said need a glossary if not in the field of psychology but still interesting.
3,"Good Movie, interesting twist","The movie was a bit more heavy than I expected. Sigourney is turning to more and more roles where she is a frustrated scientist, and this is more of the same. Surprising ending."
2,Red Lights pauses for silliness,What starts as moderately entertaining winds up as immeasurably preposterous and frustrating. A terrific cast is wasted as this tale of psychic phenom invetigators suffers from histrionic heavyhandedness and terminal silliness.
2,Not his best...,"Although I love Robert De Nero in almost anything he does, this movie was not among his best!! It was however entertaining and held our attention...."
5,Glad to finally see some good reviews!,"I am so glad I decided to give this movie a chance , because it's probably one of the best and smartest films I have seen in a very long time!"
3,All Magic Is Misdirection!,"Of course, the actors were great. Unfortunately, I could only give the film three stars because I figured things out very early on. However, I do not consider this a particular fault of the movie itself. My last English-as-a-second language student was blind. So, remembering that all magic is misdirection, the answer just came to my mind. If you liked ""The Prestige"" and ""The Illusionist,"" you should give this movie a try. It was worth the money, in my opinion."
3,"'I can play this part', but not very well...","I guess DeNiro is getting to old to act, but he played the perfectpart for his age. OLD. Good thing he had supporting actors. Themovie was hooky, slow, confusing and boring...."
1,Worse than I had heard....,"I had figured that with a cast like this and a story line inspired by the rivalry between skeptics and charlatans(Perhaps loosely inspired by Uri Geller and The Amazing Randi ?) that the movie couldn't be that bad, but I was wrong. It really was that bad. I wish I could get those 2 hours back... and it is sad to see one of my favorite actors, Robert De Niro, reduced to taking shitty movies like this. This could have been a good movie if they had changed the ending to reveal explanations for the ""psychic phenomenon"" and how cold readers trick people and prey on their weaknesses like Silvia Brown does..."
2,Kinda like the first presidential debate.,"We chose to rent this movie based on the great reviews and the actors. Oh my God, this movie was a complete disappointment. Definitely not what I expected."
2,Good until the end,It's was a good movie and then the end was very poorly written. They could have ended that in so many ways and I think they chose the worst way.
1,Movie,Dont recall this at all so can't write about it. Ridiculous u have to add more words to the write up...
3,Okay movie,Nice twist at the end. Okay movie to rent. Good cast. I did have problems with the stream and Amazon will not contact me. typical
2,Don't even remember watching it.,"I watch quite a few and usually have no problem remembering then; if not the details, then certainly the premise. Not so in this case."
2,Sleeper,Tried to be a shocking revelation movie but the ending was such a big let down. Was kind of interesting at first but failed to build creing about the actors
3,Just ok,It's an okay movie not a real deep story but hits some highlights of the peoples background enough to get an idea what's going on
2,OK,not nearly as exciting as the preview makes it out to be. good to watch if you are really really bored
2,Red Lights,"I watched this movie thinking that it would be good considering Robert De Niro and Sigourney Weaver starred in it,but it was very boring and just a dissapointment to me,,maybe I expected too much but I just didn't like it."
2,Not so good,"Good acting, not such a great plot. The ""surprise"" ending isn't tha great. Do yourself a favor and Rent something else."
2,Eh!!!,"Just kinda a ""Eh"" movie. Not terrible but not very good either. Didn't really grab me in case you can't tell."
2,poor movie feed,So far my experience with this Amazon product is not very good. Movie stops & starts too much. We may try one more movie but I'm leaning towards cancelling this service
3,not worth watching twice.,"It got a bit to supernatural for me. But I sat through it. I love Sigourney Weaver, but was disapointed in this movie."
2,Flat and slow,"The actors *could have* made this a good movie. Of course a decent script could have as well, too bad."
3,hmmm,well this movie was ok....wow deniro and sigourney are not tht great in this.... surprising as i love sigourney....not one for the collection ..simply not great enough
3,Killing time on a plane,If you need to kill some time in an airport or in the car (as a passenger) this is fine. Deniro has really let his game slip since the whole Goodfellas/Casino days.
1,Badly done even with great actors,"The story line was slow, badly put together and the whole movie was plain bad! Even with the great actors in the movie."
2,The plot was not coherent,"There are too many unanswered questions in the story. While it had some good talent in the movie, their talents were never fully utilized. It could have been much better with a more experienced director. Even the title of the movie makes no sense."
2,too slow,this movie was too slow that's why i rated as such but the plot was okay. def had a little twist to it though i figured it out before it became obvious but didn't know it from the beginning. that was probably the best aspect of the movie.
2,boring...2 stars is a stretch,"This was hard to follow, the premise is questionable and definitely way below the abilities of both Weaver and DeNiro. A big disappointment!"
3,In search of proof of paranormal experiences,"Sigourney Weaver plays a clinical psychologist Margaret Matheson who speacializes in proving non-existance of paranormal experiences. She is natural born sceptic who questions any notion on ESP existance. Her young assistant is a physicist who records all of their sessions with people who claim they experience or see ghosts and other paranormal exepriences. The intent is to find a physical proof that ESP exists.Robert DeNiro pays Simon Silver, who on the other hand, is psychic who decides to get out of his self-imposed retirement and start TV shows that will allow him to heal people and show of his paranormal abilities tot he world. It seems that Dr. Matheson and Mr. Silver have history and it is very personal. Both are determined that the other is wrong and that is how this movie starts unfolding.Surprise ending does not make this movie more exciting. It just comes out too flat."
4,I like it!,It could be better but worth the money. The end is kind of weird but the whole theme is great.
3,The Trailer Makes it Look Great,It's not great but it's ok. I found that the acting was good and the story was 3/4 good but it seemed to crumble about 3/4 of the way through. not a memorable movie.
1,Horrible movie,"I didn't watch the whole thing, it was so bad. I don't even know yet what red lights have to do with it. Awful!"
3,"Decent movie, ending a little lame","Decent movie with a lot of quality acting. I felt it flowed pretty well until the end. It as a surprise ending, I liked that part, but the surprise part was too short, and they could have been a bit more imaginitive."
1,Total Disappointment,"This was a great premise with very poor execution. Another reviewer's comment that this may be De Niro's best performance is laughable. His acting, especially in the climactic scene, is so broad it makes his work in Rocky & Bullwinkle feel nuanced. This was one of the most underwhelming movie experiences in recent memory. Stay away. Grade: D"
2,What a waste!,"I like DeNiro. I like Weaver. I wanted to like this film. I can't. It was a bit insulting in that it explains the obvious, like magic is just misdirection--in case no one had ever heard that before. The scenes were disjointed. If you have a TV, you know about ghost hunters and people with their odd contraptions trying to measure phenomena to prove or disprove their ideas. In case you've never seen these people on TV, the movie had to explain that too in a jumble of scenes. The most obvious problem with the plot was supposed to be a surprise. So, if you take a weak plot, add some clips that state the obvious, try to misdirect away from the most obvious of red herrings, and then add low light and popping electronics, a bloody fight, and dreams, this is the result. I liked approximately two things in the entire film. I'm glad I did not pay more."
2,Would be okay if you have a tiny head,"This thing is TINY. It says adult mask. My head is by no means gigantic, but attempting to get this on my head was a laughable exercise in futility. I DID eventually manage to cram my melon in, but my eyeballs and face strained at the holes like the heaving bosom of a trashy romance novel protagonist strains at a bodice. Luckily, I purchased it for a comedy sketch in a holiday revue, and after tearing it almost to the top of the head, it's serviceable in highlighting Christian Bale's awful acting. It also hurts my super manly jaw to wear.One final note for people with small enough heads to buy this on purpose: there are NO holes for the ears or nose, so I really hope you're a mouth-breather. When I exhale through my nose, it makes farting sounds up my temples and causes my entire head to be soaking wet when I am finally able to peel this off.Highly recommended."
3,"Nice mask, but flawed","The mask it self is durable, but the one I received is flawed. First of all there is glitter on it , not alot but it still should not be on it. Second the mask is not smooth all the way around, it is pitted in some area's and even has some bubbles in it. It just might be the one I received. I saw this mask around Halloween with no flaws in it. If not for the flaws I mentioned this would be a great mask for any Bat-Man fan."
3,"Great Mask, Too Tight on the head.","Ok, This mask is pretty great in the terms of Quality. But man, oh man, is this thing too small and my head is average/small. I was going to only use the bottom half of this mask so i got what I paid for. If the size of the head was bigger this would be five stars. But it's small and has no nose holes (you can put it in yourself) other than that, the price is great for this mask."
1,no good,"Material was cheap, the rubber had scratches, and the Bat logo was off and poorly made, and it looked nothing like the picture. But the the company was great and helpful really nice people that helped me straighten things out and gave me a return one star mask 5 star service."
4,Worked as described,"Well, my computer didn't blow up so I'm assuming it did what it was supposed to. By looking at the build of it, and where all the components are, it should theoretically work. I'm not going to test it by trying to destroy my computer, and my only gripe is that it was kind of difficult to put on because of the way it was built (but I also have large wrists), so I approve."
2,alligator clip has mouth open,I'm sure this thing would be perfect if the alligator clip actually closed. Zero quality control here. I have not yet decided whether to return or see if I can find another clip that will work with it. It's useless as it is...
2,Ground strap,"Says it fits all sizes but it would not fit around my wrist with out ""popping off."" Had to tape it to my arm."
5,Anti-Static Strap,"Received this anti-Static strap fast, it is of good quality and just perfect as described for working inside your computer.Used it to replace the motherboard BIOS battey and add more RAM modules to my Dell Dimension 8300 Desk Top."
3,Suitable,"The band is reasonably well made for the price, and is suitable for moderate use. It could be just a few inches longer, but is not bad. 17.5 inches not stretched, 44 inches at a reasonable stretch. The stretching has a little tougher pull than I would prefer, but is not bad. The wrist band is not elastic, which some may prefer. It fastens by a metal loop and Velcro strap, which can be a little of a nuisance to put on. If they made the metal loop 1/8 inch wider to allow the strap to pass through it easier, it would be better. The alligator clip can be removed, leaving an elongated pin that can be inserted into the ground hole of an outlet. Where the wire snaps to the wrist strap, the snap attaches and detaches easily. The snap rotates freely without any hangups. The usual 1 megohm resistance."
4,Nice strap,"Shipping was fast and has functioned properly through many jobs, a bit of a longer cord might have been useful but maybe that's just me. At the end, worth the money."
2,broke almost right away,I bought this to help while building my desktop computer. I had it clipped onto the chassis a few times off and on at the start of building while I gathered/unwrapped parts and when I went to clip on again the clip broke. I tried to reassemble but no luck.Wasn't bad for the price but would not buy again.
5,wrist strap,"This is a very nice product, delivery was prompt, I would recommend this item to anyone who likes to work on computers."
1,WOW. absolutely useless.. ZERO connectivity on multimeter,"What else do I need to say? I pulled out a multimeter to test it and basically it yielded zero connectivity. As others have stated, somewhere along the coiled wires must have been a break.I find it ironic that this item so horribly and miserably fails at the one and only thing it was designed to do. This is equivalent to having a life vest that doesn't inflate or float when you need it to."
1,TOTAL JUNK.,TOTAL JUNK.I ATTACHED A CONTINUITY TESTER TO ONE END OF THE LEAD AND THE OTHER TO ALL PORTIONS OF THE WRISTSTRAP INCLUDING THE METAL PLATE. THERE IS NO CONTINUITY.
3,Meh,"I am pretty sure these things are a complete rip-off, but I'm not willing to take any risks when paying so much for my new build. The cord is too short, wrist strap is too small, and its generally poor quality. On the other hand, I don't think it makes sense to break the bank for a tool which probably serves no function whatsoever."
2,too small for wrist works anyway,"Too small to fit around the wrist I attached it instead by wrapping it around the base of the last three fingers of my right hand. The wire was thin and appears short but strong enough to pull off the snap on clip. A too small product but it arrived quickly and in good condition. A tiny electronics assembler or computer repairer might be well served, otherwise pass. This is a case of needing a better mousetrap.Belkin Anti-Static Wrist Band with Adjustable Grounding"
4,Works as described,"I haven't used any others so I can't compare it to the competition. However, this worked just fine. Although, it would be nice if the cord were longer. I used a piece of copper wire to extend it."
3,The cheapest looking wrist strap ever,"It is light weight at least but all velcro with a metal flat piece. The cord is wound tight so there is a lot of spring to it as well as being short. The worst wrist strap I have ever seen. I doubt if it would last very long in an every day use kind of setting. As far as tightening it is good but material ahh. I am used to the professional wrist straps either being metal braclet, blue something or other with band tightening stupid clip, or burgundy with stupid clip but stays. Not some cheap flimsy thing that is short in length. Computer guys must be rating this. I guess if you touch electronics and it still works after you are done then this strap will get a good rating. Colors are decent but the length and material to me is no good."
3,Holds firm!,I am an independent contractor for computer repair and this strap works just fine. It seems to work backwards though or I just haven't figured it out yet.
4,A must have tool for those who build computers!,"If you work on static sensitive electronics then you will need to have one of these. It dissipates static electricity while you are working on electronics. This is a must have tool for you if you build computers. Motherboards, CPU's, GPU's, SSD's, disk drives, memory sticks, etc. are all susceptible to damage from static electricity. You can wipe out a $600 CPU before you even plug it in the socket!You put this onto your wrist and attach it to the metal chassis of the item you are working on. They are a pain to wear but they do have a self-coiling cord to give you some flexibility. You can adjust it to fit your wrist for comfort.I own a couple of brands of these and there is one I like better than this one for the comfort factor. For under $8.00 this is still good insurance for handling those expensive computer components!"
5,Not what I had in mind...,"I though anti-static wrist band were supposed to be more complicated than this, but it does the job well. Better than touching a metal surface every now and then. I like to use both hands when working, not just one on the computer chassis and the other one pulling things."
4,Good Product,This anti-static wrist band is worth the money. I just wish the band was elastic instead of Velcro. Will buy another once this one goes bad.
5,The Real Deal....TREADMILL Shock!!,"I use my Belkin Anti-Static Wrist Band for my workouts on the treadmill. Right out the box the treadmill shocked the shyt outta me from its first use--from start to finish whether walking or running. This wrist band grounds me, making my workouts shock free. What a relief!!! I highly recommend it. The attaching cord is flexible and not nearly long enough to risk tripping while jogging....another plus."
4,Good starter Anti-Static Wrist Band,Not the biggest or the best but for someone just starting out the price is right.
3,So so,"works as advertised, however ,a pain in the but with the cord. the better item is the cord free clean room items."
5,Great Anti-static Wrist Band,"I build custom PCs and other small electronics and this is a simple and cheap protection for expensive components. It has held up great and I would not only recommend it, but say you are foolish if you fail to use these protection for your components when working on them."
3,it works,its okay it fits your wrist good but the clamp does not stay i had to constantly re-position the clamp before touching my computer they should really redesign the clamp
3,does the job,It does the job. My only complaint is that the velcroe strap isn't very big. could use a longer strap.
2,Not RMB's best,"I love Rita Mae Brown. Period. And my intention is to read everything she has written. So Riding Shotgun came up on the list. I was thinking that Shotgun was a horse, named so in several other books. But no. I'm not even sure what the connection is between the title and the story. In typical RMB style everything seems to be thoroughly researched and nicely written. But the problem is, its boring. I just wasn't interested. Didn't like any of the characters, didn't connect with them. Just didn't care. Sorry, RMB. Just not your best."
5,need a movie,I absolutely love this book. This is my second most favorite book by Rita Mae Brown. For anyone that believes in reincarnation Riding Shotgun is a must read. This book should be made into a WE or Lifetime movie. I wish Ms. Brown would write more like Riding Shotgun and High Hearts.
4,Well worth your attention,"Being more used to this author's mystery novels, I was expecting something along the same lines with this one. Granted there are elements of mystery here but the primary themes of the novel are love and the many forms it can take, the importance of forgiveness, and just keeping life in perspective.The main characters were well developed, particularly the seventeenth century ones.Above all, this was a fun book. Give it a go."
4,An Enjoyable Trip,"Ms. Brown has written a fine, vivid novel. She opens up several different plot elements and intricately weaves them together. She does this with the most sucess in the second part of her book. However, the third part is a bit short, and Ms. Brown seems to try to tie up all the loose ends of her story rather hastily. The main character, Cig, is well developed, except why she gains an extremely forgiving nature is not well explained. The hunt scenes are executed beautifully and acurately. These are the best parts of the novel. They convey action and emotion all at once. This book is a fine read, but I wish Ms. Brown could have explained certain events and characters more clearly."
5,"Once again, well done","This was a delightfully fascinating story, especially with time warp parallel. Very descriptive and she doesn't leave who hanging anywhere. Very comprehensive and such a funny and interesting story. One of my favorite authors."
1,A Real Disappointment,This book was just plain awful. I did not know that Rita Mae Brown had gone so far from her Sister and Sneaky Pie books. I will be very careful in the future to see that I avoid such drivel
2,"Brilliant in parts, not a great as a whole","The period scenes are marvelous, as are the vivid descriptions of fox hunting etc. But Cig, the title character, was thoroughly unlikeable to me. Her treatment of her daughter sent chills down my spine. This woman was so totally selfish and self absorbed that by the end of the book I found it difficult to care what happened to her! Also, while the book was excellent in parts, it definitely dragged in others mainly because (as one reviewer has already pointed out), there was a lot of prior novel plot/dialouge rehashing. Not one of Rita Mae's best....."
3,Only part way through it.,"Started reading it right after Screaming Eagles under Siege, Vietnam 1970 and this is more watered down than the first book. So I need to read more of it to give a fair comparison"
4,And I forgot how to breathe..,"This book keeps you entertained to the end. All story... and the heroine, Phadra, is a delight, NEVER boring... and the hero, Grant is what makes us pick up these romances, strong, handsome and hunky... this one a bit more fun, he is a banker and bit stiff..was fun watching Phadra unwind him.The book is fast and full of fun. My kind of book, the kind you cant put down. First book I have read by Cathy Maxwell, and tomorrow, I will look for her others.Their loss of breath, got a bit old after reading that line many times during the book... but it was still a very enchanting book. I salute you Ms Maxwell!!! Very fine read indeed."
4,Charming Read,"The is a story that is an enjoyable afternoon read. The characters are different and the hero is very likable. Sometimes I struggled with the heroine because in her attempt at ""equality"", I sometimes felt she was not fair to her husband. She wanted the respect but often didn't give it in the story, but that was pretty much all that got on my nerves. Otherwise, an entertaining read. I think this is a good subject matter because I am sure there were many women in that time who felt trapped in a certain set of circumstances for which they were not well suited, and thus, not well accepted by society."
5,Love Cathy Maxwell,"At first I could not get into Phadra so I read ""All Things Beautiful"" first but when I came back to ""Treasured Vows"" it was great. I love Miss Maxwell's sex scenes, character development and the flow between series books, but I LOVE EPILOGS. After you have gotten so wrapped up in a book and the characters, without an epilog, the story really is not finished."
2,The worst romance book I've ever read in my life.,"I cannot believe that this book is rated so high when the story is so full of holes and the plot makes no sense what so ever. As a person who loves reading romance novels I was very disappointed in this author one of my favs before this book.The heroine was so silly in her belief of women independence above all things in the book I didn't know I could dislike a lead character so much. I forced myself to read to the end and things did not get better it grew worst. Please if this book is like 1 cent buy it, if not don't waste your money."
2,Disappointment in a can...times six,"If you like your mangoes very ripe and mushy, bathed in mango puree, this is for you.Clearly, I do not find this product appealing.However, if I were to make mango mousse, mango jello, or anything else where I might need pureed mangoes these would be perfect. (They do have chunks in the can, but since they're so soft pulverizing them in a blender seems a natural thing to do.)This would probably also make great smoothies, mango gelato, mango bread pudding...you get the idea."
2,Should have read reviews!,These canned mangoes were nothing like the ones I got when I was in New Zealand. These are from India - the ones I got in NZ were from Thailand. These don't even taste like mangoes and are mostly juice.
1,I wish there was a 0 star rating,"Not only is this product built to break it is plagued by middle ware and proprietery copy schemes. You have to use either musicmatch jukebox (shudder) or e.digital's music explorer to copy files to/from it. The problem is that bulk copies with music explorer reorder the tracks so the playlists on the player are scrambled.Also the buttons are constructed extremely poorly. Within 2 weeks I broke the play and stop buttons. If you press too hard they snap off and fall into the crappy plastic case. I have had to resoldier the output jack back onto the main circuit board no less than 3 times, and this requires taking the entire unit apart and working around the unremovable lcd screen.Overall DO NOT BUY THIS PLAYER EVER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. If you get one for free immediately throw it on the ground and stomp it to pieces."
1,Back away from the player,I hope you like it when the buttens pop of the things you buy. And if you like dealing with media errors then this is the mp3 player for you. Do yourself a favor and invest in a GOOD player like the jukebox.
2,Seems great at first...,"I bought the Classic MP3 player because of its capacity -- others only held about an hours worth of music. Had difficuly getting the software going -- user manual doesn't help at all. Technial support is a mystery. Finally figured that out -- thought all was great. Navigation is easy, the unit is about the size of a walkman, sound quality is great, etc. Recently I've been having problem with unit freezing up. Sometimes will play 4-5 songs, sometimes only 1. Only way I can fix is to pry the battery unit off (if let run down, gets very hot). I'd strongly caution anyone else against buying this product. Too many headaches for too much money!"
3,Time Bomb,"This is one of the most frustrating electronic devices I have ever owned. It works great to start with. Simple usb and power hook up using musicmatch. But handle with care because with time and use the buttens fall off. Don't think it was just that one that I got. I sent it back and they gave me a new one, the buttons fell off, I sent it back again, the buttons fell off again. I'm on my last one, if it breaks again, i'm going to ipod or something. This is a great mp3 player to have if you like making buttons out of paper and hot glue."
1,Yuck,"This is a remarkable piece of junk. It freezes up after most songs and the play button popped out of mine. You should avoid products made by this no-name company. Their customer service was also a complete waste of time. Avoid, avoid, avoid products by Classic."
1,"It started nicely, then failed","It worked on the first CD I loaded down into it, then the download button greyed out permanently, so I am returning the device. It's a failure"
1,$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ Wasted,"I Dropped 200$ in TO A hunk of junk IN the First 2 hours all the buttons poped in to the player ""simple fix"" A pen to Work it. then the line out broke, i got mad and put it under my dads truck tire the end of that. DO NOT BUY THIS BUY A IPOD."
3,Works Great With Additional Software,I too thought this Mp3 player was a great price and it is for 10gigs of storage. The not being able to upload from device to computer really made me frustrated and mad until i did sum digging and found edig.com web site. If you download the firmware update for the treo in the product support section of that website it comes with sum software called e.digital musical explorer that lets u transfer back and forth from device to computer in a windows explorer type of window. It works great with the CHD1000 if not for that software i would have trashed the thing and took the price as a loss. I would include url but its not allowed. Any questions feel free to hit me up on yahoo as philavs1876.
5,Trouble with the chd1000? Read this.,"Well, after reading these reviews and some one another site selling these, I've come to a conclusion that you have to be somewhat intelligent to use this. It is not that hard to install the software, just install it, and then uninstall musicmatch. Musicmatch is horrible, I'm using edigitals Music Explorer to send everything to the Xp3, so I'm pretty much set. The install cd will tell you it doesn't work with XP, but just hit continue anyway and you're all set. It isn't hard to use, at all."
1,I should have paid Attention to Negative Reveiws,"I alway ignore most negative reveiw about a product, becase I believe that People are just posting negative comment for fun. this is not the Truth with this Player.Please Don't Buy.Withing 3 hours (I swear ""believe me"") the Play/Puase and Stop Button Flew off the Unit. I couldn't beleive it. I remember reading the Review and Think ""what did these guys do to make the buttons come off"" No I know. they didn't do anything. this Unit is Cheap A** Sh*T.I still use it, becuase I can't afford to buy another, buy I had to enlarge the play/ stop hole to allow me to stick a pen into the unit to touch the eletrical conponent to play and stop a song ""I swear"""
5,A laugh out loud success!,This is the author's first book and I have to say it is an successful one. It is definitely a laugh out loud adventure through the eyes of a young journalist. The love affair is gripping and real. Highly recommend this book!
3,Average,"After reading all of the great reviews of this book, I must admit I was rather disappointed. I am a very fast reader, and when interested in a book, I tend to finish it rather fast. Not so with this book - I had no motivation to finish, to the point where I had ten pages to read and absolutely no rush. It was very predictable - if you can make it through the first 50 pages and NOT figure out how the book is going to end, you must be very dense. The characters were likable enough, but it was far too predictable and fairy tale-ish. I have read much more engaging and interesting chick lit novels - this one falls on my average list..."
4,Entertaining and fun,I wasn't sure when I started reading if I was going to like this story. Very glad that I gave it a chance. Loved the characters. Playing James was a truly enjoyable read and found myself rooting for Holly. Look forward to reading more by this author.
3,Average,"This was an average book. I have to admit some of it was difficult to understand because of very british terms like... Casualty, Jaffa Cakes, OAP, RAC, swedes, marrows... and of course terms I am familiar with like... sod, flat, bobby. There were just words I had to skip!Some of the book was very funny. But over all kinda boring. The romance was non-existant until the end of the book. If you have nothing better to read, then fine. Otherwise, skip it!"
5,great beach read,I brought this book on a weekend away and found it to be the perfect beach read! I laughed the whole way through and loved the quirky characters. I passed it on the the other women with me and they all loved it too. It was light and funny and great for some down time in the sand.
3,Mildly amusing chic lit...,"I had a hard time getting into this book, the beginning was slow, it seemed like the author tried too hard to make the beginning light & funny. The middle of the book got interesting as the characters came out & situations arose. The end was almost cheezy predictable.Overall I'd say read this book if you have nothing else to do, it's cute, but drags on a bit."
1,Bootleg as it gets!!!!,"Don't buy this dodgy waste of money!!! Not only does the seller claim it is legit, but the episodes are not in any kind of order! Since Sony will probably not release all the episodes, you may be tempted to buy bootlegs. Don't get this one, however! There are sets with all 190, in order with the same sound & picture quality as this one. Sony does NOT lease any of the episodes out, except to television! Only four are in the public domain, and they ain't here!!!"
3,They do Suck!... but,"I bought one of these sets. Yes, packaging is pathetic. The DVDs themselves are Very Poor. Constant lockups, fuzzy.As a plus, Sony sucks for not allowing us to buy quality versions of these.In a nutshell, put up with the crap quality and be glad to see some gems we may not see again in our lifetimes (unless Sony wakes up!)."
1,Seller very unprofessional,"I am very disatisfied, the owner cancelled my order!!!! I was to have this item before collge started and the seller cancelled at the last minute, the whole deal seemed pretty shady from the beginning!!!"
3,"Very compact battery, but not high capacity","This battery is about the size of 3 Sony Memory Sticks stacked on top of each other, which is really tiny! One downside, though, is that it only allows for 60 minutes of shooting time on my Sony CyberShot DSC-P5 compared to 180 minutes the InfoLithium M battery gives me on my DSC-S30. It would be nice if there was a higher capacity alternative, but there is not. So we will live with it, for now."
4,"smaller battery, smaller capacity","This battery is just 500 to 600 mAh, as compared to a 1150mAh M series battery, its size and capacity is so small. Besides, it do not have a double or trible size alternative. SonyHP.com has a detail comparsion of them. It often price from [money amount]to [money amount]."
4,Camera Lithium Battery,Batteries arrived early and in good shape. They have restored my camera to good working condition. Well-worth the price.
1,Battery dead,Battery wont hold a charge. Could only take a few pictures with it before it died. This was after a full charge.
3,battery,"We would like to comment the battery pack 3,6 volt 2,4 mH for Sony Digital Camera Type DSCP-5,very difficult to find at the market.Please give us the reference the MTBF and MTBR for the battery and how many hours the battery recomended for recharged.Thank you for your attention."
5,A Post Punk New Wave Masterpiece,"Without question one of the best, most defining albums of the early eighties post punk/new wave scene. Sounds just as fresh today as it did when it was originally released. Punky, spikey, dancy rhythms, jagged guitars, pulsing bass, pounding drums and one of the best female vocalists ever! Vanessa is amazing. An absolute must!"
3,Not as good as Chomp,"Chomp's better, plain and simple. This is angular in a sort of dry, mathematical way without being NEARLY as catchy as Chomp overall. Still not bad, but the band had better stuff to offer it turns out."
4,Major contribution,"This is a major contribution to our knowledge of film. The movies themselves probably didn't look as good when released as they do now. This Happy Breed and Madeleine are a bit weak, but this is made up for by the seven others. Everyone needs a copy of the superb Hobson's Choice.My only complaint is with the packaging. The raised centers holding a disc break off, leaving discs to roll around the box. I put CD sleeves between the double discs, and that seems to work and minimize the possible damage. The five disc packages are also fitted into the box too tightly. Quibbles. This is a collection you want to own."
3,Disappearing David Lean Collection,"Note: though the product title has gone, this review was about the collection of David Lean's films from the 1950s, including Oliver Twist and Hobson's Choice. It was released, but just as quickly withdrawn. The original note is below.The ""review"" I wrote a couple of weeks ago needs ammending; I first discovered the collection was to be released on a US website; but since the release date has come and gone with no discs, I've checked with some DVD online sellers and discovered that no-one except Canadian sites now lists it, and they all say -- not yet released. The hypothesis is that the set has been withdrawn, for reasons unknown. If that is indeed the case, then don't look to see it any time soon. I also agree with the other reviewer: it's a sin that these discs are being given Region 1 release without the extras supposedly available on the Region 2 releases. It's looking more and more like I ought to get an all-region, overscan correcting player ....."
1,Hope you speak Korean !,"After waiting for years for some of David Lean's lesser-known films to come out on DVD, I was thrilled when I discovered this collection...until it arrived. If you don't speak Korean, you're out of luck- if you want to find a particular movie, you have to rifle through all of the cases as they're labeled only in Korean. Very annoying, especially at the price I paid. Don't waste your money- wait for a better edition to come out."
4,Spanish civil war from socialist perspective,"Although written in the late thirties, this is still one of the best titles on the Spanish civil war available. Unlike many other books on the subject, which analyze the events from either an anarchist or stalinist point of view, Morrow offers a socialist perspective. He illustrates quite well the shortcomings of both the anarcho-syndicalist CNT-FAI but does not fail to criticize the strategy and tactics of the ""marxist"" POUM either. Morrow takes specific events and shows how the POUM repeatedly failed to fill a revolutionary void due to its indecisive leadership. Indispensable reading material for socialist activists as well as readers with a general interest in labor history and revolutionary history."
5,Works as expected,This was to replace the label paper that came with the Dymo Letratag Plus (medium blue typewriter type model). It is opague white with black text. It doesn't smudge. The description said for letratag. I wish it would say for all letratag as there are a few models.
3,Doesn't quite fit,"A filter is a filter, not much difference between one and another. I haven't needed to clean this filter yet so I can't say anything about that. However, this filter did not fit snuggly in a Camry 98 4cy 1.1L. The filter housing has rounded corners and this filter has square corners, so after putting it in, the filter bent up a little. No problems since the cover will push the filter down, but it would have been nice to have a better fit."
1,NOT THE SAME VIDEO,The video on demand is not the same as Rollin's 1979 film. This is some stupid movie with the same title and saying it has the same cast. BUT ITS NOT. You'll have to order the DVD.
5,Brilliant . . . Genius . . . Dark . . .,"Damon is a heck of a songwriter. After hearing all these songs live so many times -- played with his minimalist trio sound, or even solo -- it was a bit odd to hear them with full instrumentation. Odd but not bad. His voice is big. His guitar picking is excellent. His songs are superb."
5,This is what country is supposed to sound like,"Forget alt-country, and forget the [stuff] coming out of Nashville--this is what country music is supposed to sound like. Great guitar picking, a fantastic voice (at times reminiscent of Cash), and really solid lyrics. It's a pleasant surprise to find a country musician equally adept at songwriting, playing guitar and singing his own songs. This one's all original too, folks. Kelly Willis has already recorded one of Damon's songs, and I have a feeling a lot of other ""country"" artists will do the same soon; but take my advice and get it from the source. You'll be glad you did."
1,Wow...Just Wow,This is a trainwreck. Talk about no talent. Thank god I heard this garbage on mp3 and didn't actually pay for it. This guy might sell 2 copies if he buys his own double album. Wow this SUCKS
2,Wrong size,For any reason the information about the cord size is incorrect..I bought this item to cover some new connection in coax cable...this item does not work for RG6 coax cable.
5,Surgery And Its Alternaitve: How to Make the Right Choices for Your Health,This book sits on bookshelf with my other health books. It's packed with information that I've never seen anywhere else. It's a good read with lots of worthwhile advice and I recommend that everyone have a copy.
3,Combat - Season 3,My boyfriend is constantly searching for DVDs of old TV shows - he got excited when he saw this listed and I purchased it for him last Christmas
2,Cheap but didn't work for me,"Very economic and Zonet has always worked fine for me. Unfortunately not this one. It has a weird issue of not being to handle Web traffic (didn't try other types though). With network devices connected, the basic services like Ping, DNS worked OK: no disconnect or lost packets or anything. However computers just couldn't get to websites - just trying and trying and no data. Tried all kinds of computers: Linux, Windows 7, Windows Vista, with all sorts of browsers. Nothing could get through. Frustrated, I got an old Linksys WG54L, disabled its DHCP and wireless to just use its ethernet switch, and all computers worked fine. Never seen this kind of weird problem before."
2,Way Abstract. Not Much Funk.,"I can't say a whole lot of good things about this CD, so I'll keep it short and sweet. The songs aren't mixed, the songs make you wait for disappointingly anticlimactic breakdowns, compilations that include works of other artists sound much better mixed, and KY seems to have gotten lost in the land of Creative Exploration, forgetting the big picture in the process. Where is the trademark Yost smoothness that keeps me bumping Small Town Underground and Straight Out the Boon Dox each and every day? Nowhere to be seen."
1,Not good,"I was expecting some more of Kevin's JAZZ FUNK HOUSE, but instead got a regular, dime a dozen TECH HOUSE cd, and not a very good one at that. So who ever kidnapped Kevin Yost, bring him back so he can do what he does best. JAZZ FUNK HOUSE."
4,Funky Pleasant!,"Not as much of a dance record per se as was Small Town Underground, Mr Yost's very nice continous house-music mix. This is funky yet minimalist, reminding me of early purely electronic music at times, without that distinct ""house sound."" Mostly intrumental except for ""close to my skin,"" where the voice is used as a repititious element. Not a continous mix. A very random, funky ambient feel. Lots of Bongo's and lively beats with a complexity of textures on top, nothing too slammin' though. Very Nice. Nothing to think about--just feel and respond to some fine, heady, chill-grooves."
2,not much here,"I should have taken the title of the CD a bit more into consideration before buying Yost's latest. Not mixed - feels like it's trying to prove something... Consistency might not be what ky is into right now, but that is what I was hoping for --- consistent deep, smooth, jazzed-out house...If that's what you are looking for, I'd stay away from this abstraction.But i'll still pay to hear him when/if he comes back to Atlanta."
3,Decent... if you're already a programmer,"This book is rife with errors. Many screenshots in the first half do not match their descriptions, and grammatical issues abound. This book purports to be a guide for first-time programmers, but I believe that the glossed-over explanations would confuse a first-time developer. I have a background in PHP and Java, and mainly wanted this as a beginner's guide to Visual Studio Express. In that capacity, this is a decent book. If you have a similar background to my own, you will find C# extremely easy to learn, and this book's problems will not hold you back. The second edition of this book will likely fix the errors present in this edition, and at that time, I might recommend this book. However, in it's present state it's hard to drop twenty bucks on such a frustrating volume."
4,I wish I started programming with this book,"The times for programming are so much more friendly to new comers. This book is wonderfully easy to ready, and beginner friendly. You don't feel like you're reading a textbook.I like that this book is so thin. It really didn't take long to get through this (perhaps because i've programmed already). it also covers using the tools to connect to SQL Server Express. But what's even cooler is that it demonstrates how to connect to web services.You also get the basics of the C# language. Which for C++ folks will be like sailing on a sunny day. But for new comers, will be straight forward.It's so easy. If students completely new to programming want a place to start (and want to program on Windows), get this book, it comes with Visual C# Express 2005 and SQL Server Express 2005 (so no high speed internet connection needed).Plus the author looks like a cool biker dude. :)"
3,"Good primer, but poorly edited","This is a good starting point if you're new to C#. I have to agree with Glenn's review (above) as this book is very poorly edited and contains numerous errors. It's not hard to figure out what they are trying to say, but it's annoying nonetheless. I'll think twice before I buy another Wrox book."
4,This Is Pretty Good Techno,"DJ Keoki is a major figure in the Techno scene. This album is pretty fly. There are some songs here that I like more than the others, and some strong points here and there. It is pretty fair throughout."
2,THIS is unfortunate,"I like good dance and trance, and this isn't it. Bumpy jabber-overlaid schlock is being resold as I type."
4,Mad Just Before the Decline.,Mad as a magazine hit its pinacle in the mid 1960s and then began a decline away from the adult readership to the aimed at kids pap it is today.The 1970s was however was a fertile period but you can see Mad's shift away from social issues towards the entertainment industry.Still a fun read though.
1,"Track #17 ""Catch a Moment,""","I too was going to buy this album based on Track #17 ""Catch a Moment,"" which I also heard online. Great song, and I would totally buy it, but don't make me buy a crappy album to get this track.It's not 1999 anymore dude."
1,Disappointing waste of time,"I purchased this cd after hearing some innovative and sophisticated mixing of another Rub&Tug; track streaming from a great online radio station. I figured I wanted to hear more and bought the cd -- sound unheard. What a big mistake!This cd is dull, without direction, juvenile and reminscent of early 80's synth pop when no one knew what they are were doing but just liked the sound of the new toys that were available to them. This cd is a boring waste of time and money.The ONLY redeeming quality of this cd is Track #17 ""Catch a Moment,"" which is why I bought the cd, in hopes of some of the other tracks being of similar quality -- smooth, soulful vocals, creative use of sounds and beats... I was wrong. This track is totally out of place on an otherwise poor cd.Find some of their more creative mixes online and save your money. Truly disappointing."
2,not so much,"Sadly, this is not what i thought it was. If you know anything about guitaring, or even the basic chords, this is not for you. None of the songs are ones known, and it can be hard to catch the strumming on the practice songs.. Overall, not somthing iwould recommend"
5,Great!!!,I am a true beginner and was so excited to be playing along with praise songs (very short but very good) the first day!!! CD was wonderful! The strumming lessons made the songs fun! My family didn't even scurry off for ear plugs!! Great product and I highly recommend it for the true beginner like me!
2,PROGRAM BETTER THAN BOOK,A TRAINING PROGRAM LIKE THIS MAY BE MORE HELPFUL THAN THIS BOOK. THIS MAY BE A HELPFUL LINK TO HELP YOU GET STARTED: [...]
4,"Real Estate Jargon With Definitions in ""English""",I highly recommend this book for the new homebuyers out there. I never realized how much terminology I didn't know in the real estate world. I was able to skim through the book fairly quickly and flagged the terms that related to my needs which alleviated some of the stress of homebuying. I felt that I was educated enough not to get ripped off. The tips were very useful and the layout was clear and consise. Read this book before you get an agent or a loan officer.
5,Go In With Knowledge,"This book helped me to understand and be aware of the many goings on in a real estate transaction. I was able to go into the process prepared and with good questions to ask my agent about the property, costs, etc. I highly recommend this book."
4,Informative,"I was hoping that by reading this book I would be able to buy a home on my own without a realtor, however, although truly informative, I doubt that it provided me with enough information to be that independent. Definitely a good book, but needs to be back up with other sources."
5,Get it!,If you are a first time buyer... BUY IT!!!!There is information there that nobody else will bother telling you!
2,"Author should read ""how to structure a book for dummies""","This is one of the most confusingly organized books I've read in a long time. I finally gave up after chapter six, frustrated by the fact that I was reading about mortgage subtleties when I still hadn't even been presented suggestions on what to buy or how to ferret out a good realtor. As a newbie to homebuying, I was much more interested in getting a step-by-step sense of the process than a bunch of scattershot terminology definitions. Ilyce Glink's books are much better."
4,Home Buying For Dummies,I think that this book gives excellent insight into all the ins and outs that someone should know when purchasing their first home.
3,Basic,a good started but some of the ideas and suggestions are too basic and they do not give an accurate and real image of the home buying experience and what is the best way to do it.
2,Not a great buy if you have bought Author's other books.,"I was expecting little detailed explanation regarding home financing, but the book simply dispensed advised 'buy my other book' -'Mortgage for dummies'Many of the information given in this book have practically same content as other books from same authors namely 'Personal finance for dummies' 'Small businesses for dummies'. I am _not_ going to pay for 'Mortgage for dummies' to get one more printed table of 'tax brackets' in USA.No new information here - plain advice that your parents would give you for free!This book reading"
3,"Tedious to Read, But Contains Good Info","If you've read other ""For Dummies"" books, you'll be used to the style. Prose padded with dumb jokes and needless words so that ""dummies"" can digest the helpful information within. However, the information has all been useful and has made our first home buying experience less stressful. I grudgingly give this book 3 stars--even though my wife and I had t bribe ourselves with Mighty O doughnuts to slog through each chapter. Beware, or you may gain a few pounds as well as an education on homebuying."
4,Very helpful,We picked this up when we were going to buy our first home. It helped us to make the right decision and not feel stupid by asking questions.
4,Read this before you go to your first open house!,"A friend recommended this because she read the first chapter and decided she had no business buying a house. Yes, it's that good. We have used it to help us select a lender and a Realtor, and it also helps by suggesting some decisions that should be made before you select those people. It is so much clearer now what escrow is. And why it matters who your home inspector is.Bottom line, when you go shopping for the home of your dreams, it's best to be concentrating on the house, not wondering about all those terms the Realtor just threw at you. Read this first and the home-buying process is much clearer. If your realty agent confuses you, you know enough to ask them to clarify things. And if it still isn't clear, you'll know enough to find another realty agent.Read this book! Buying a house is stressful enough without it."
5,Educational,"I read this book before buying my first house. It made quite a difference in my relationship with my real estate agent. I knew what questions to ask and what to look for in an agent, a house and even a mortgage company. A great read for any first-time buyer."
5,A must for new buyers,"This book is amazing. I never considered buying a ""for Dummies"" series book because I thought they would be overly simplisitic, but this book proved me wrong. The authors do an awesome job of presenting just enough detail on every aspect of buying a home- I kept catching myself having a questions, then reading on to the net chapter and finding the answer. You may be tempted to skip around from chapter to chapter, but I've found that reading this book from the beginning is almost necessary since things like understanding which mortgage to get and how much of a house you want are all dependant on answers you arrive at in early chapters. I've just finished the book and feel well prepared and educated to tackle the house-hunting task now. A definite read."
2,bad fit,"I love my Shake and Take -- the whole family does. So I ordered the set of 2 extra bottles. One of the two will not work at all (I can't twist it into place) and the other will work with some effort. I would still buy this product again, but I wouldn't throw away the box and pamphlets until I knew both bottles worked correctly."
2,I Wouldn't Waste My Money Again,"I got the Shake n Take blender and the extra bottles. This whole gadget isn't all the great. The openings in the bottles are small, making getting things into them messy unless you are pouring liquids. By the time you get a banana and a few strawberries in there not too much room left for anything else. Believe me it isn't going to make me forget about my Cuisinart stick blender anytime soon."
2,not sturdy,this blender and its bottles are very useful. the bottels however are pooooorly made and break apart at the top where the lid screws on and the bottom.
4,made in USA,"Love that these are made in USA. Nice quality construction; effective but did feel heat through mitt if held a bit too long. 4 instead of 5 stars due to rubbery smell, and fit for smaller hands not as nice as cloth type mitts."
4,Los Tucanes De Tijana vs. Intocable,"Great song by both artist, I especially liked the one by Intocale called ""Eres Mi Droga"". All great songs, you wont do any skipping, you'll enjoy all the songstroughout the CD."
2,Not great for the price,"I actually only bought the mask. Be aware it is made completely from rubbery plastic and does not maintain its shape. The large point on top hangs down and flops around. After reinforcing the inside with quite a bit of strategically placed paperboard and hot glue, I got it to look quite good. Also, the black mesh which is supposed to hide your face is completely see-through, so I had to wear an additional face mask underneath..."
1,these are cheap FAKE 7 jeans - not the real thing!,"these are NOT 7 for all mankind jeans if that's what you are looking for - those jeans go for $125-200 a piece. the people who make these came up with their ""similar"" name to trick you into buying them - they probably figure its a numbers game and ""some"" will just keep them.. dont be fooled - if youre looking for real 7's - go to eluxury.com or gogo clothing's page through amazon.com and you'll find them there."
2,unorganized and disconnected.,"I've been playing jazz guitar for years and know the value of chord studys especially for players of finger style jazz (joe pass). I purchased this book for my cousin as a birthday gift as he is just starting to play jazz guitar. Too my surprise the book is pretty much worthless, sure it has lots of chords, but they are presented in a way that does nothing to help the student understand how chords are used. Many of the chords presented are unrealistic in as far as the demands placed on the hand(excessive stretching..ouch!).The chords that most jazz guitarist use today and yesterday have always been to make efficient use of the hands(some of the chords require that you make a 7 fret stretch in first position). I for one have never seen any of the great guitarist ever stretch beyond 5 frets and most stay at 4 frets including my self. This chord bible clearly needs a revision!"
5,Excellent reference for Jazz progressions,It is the equivalent of Chord Chesmitry in the Jazz Progressions area. But it shows you the right sounds. A cool place to investigate with real progressions. Quite musical but demanding.Essential purchase.
3,"Spicy, but Dry","Bought these based on the reviews because I was looking for a more substantial snack that would replace chips or protein bars.These are pretty spicy and not sweet, perfect for those tired of those sugar ladened ones out there. Not overly salted either.I really like the resealable package and size, perfect for keeping in a desk drawer or school bag.My only disappointment is that these are drier and chewier than most jerkies I've had, but might be due to lack of preservatives and stabilizers, so more of a plus than a minus.Worth a try."
5,Franz Schubert & Gidon Kremer - a partnership for excellence in music,"Fabulous violinist Gidon Kremer recorded (along with various partners) the complete works for violin by Franz Schubert. Pianists Oleg Maisenberg and Valery Afanassiev pair the Latvian musician mainly in Sonatas, Fantasy or Variations for violin and piano, while other renowned string players (such as violist Tabea Zimmermann, hornist Radovan Vlatkovic or cellist David Geringas) team him up for Octet, Polonaise, Concerto movement or Rondo for violin and chamber orchestra.The result is astonishing. The refined musicianship of Kremer seems perfectly suited for that sweet melodiousness of the Schubertian inspiration. This 4-CD box issued by Deutsche Grammophon is a marvellous sample of great music and a deep bow by a super-star violinist to a super-star composer!"
5,Falling in love with Schubert,"If you do not know the work of Schubert,this CD will be your point of start.Excellent!"
3,Too big!!,"I loved the look of this watch but when I got it, found that the dial is HUGE and overwhelmed my small wrist. It probably would be good for someone of a medium to large build."
3,Compact but not so great,"I bought this mouse to use with my laptop computer. I carry it around a lot and it takes up a little less space than a regular sized mouse. But the small size makes my hand cramp after using it for a while. Also the scroll wheel is loud and jerky and it comes with a USB connection and a bulky converter if you want to use a PS/2 port. Overall, I would go with a different mouse unless small size is the most important thing to you."
2,"Low price, but not a great buy","I have bought two of these mouses, the second to replace a horrible squeaking problem that the first mouse had. The replacement mouse squeaks just as bad.This is a cheap mouse. I am not happy."
3,Used Car Type Sales,I purchased the item then noticed it did not say optical mouse. A ball mouse anyone will tell you is obsolete. So I tried to contact the seller by email and it came back to me.I contacted Yahoo and apparently that is what they are a bunch of. The description was misleading. The product is well worn.I do not like dealing with people or companies that are deceptive. I would not by anything else under such circumstances.
2,Hstory,"I'm struggling to learn the math parts of IP addressing/sub-netting, I figured a book on fundamentals should have what I'm looking for. But I was mistaken... This book seems to give most of is pages on ""History"" or why thins are as they are. It may be interesting down the road but is of very little help now."
1,"Very, very predictable","This story was very predictable. I thought the plot needed to be worked on, but it has a happy ending, which is why anyone would want to read it in the firt place."
4,good bridge,im very short and its hard for me to hit some of the pool balls when im playing thats the reason i bought this bridge. its an advantage for someone short like me. recommend it.
3,Decent bridge cue for the price,"It arrived in one piece, shipped by OnTrac (not UPS) since I have a Prime membership. It's a bit on the thin side and the lightweight aluminum head isn't as nice as the old fashioned heavy brass one my family used when I was young, but hey, it's an entry-level bridge at a bargain price. With care it should last and do the job."
1,EXTREMELY BAD!!!!,Worst thing I ever saw. Half the time the video is not even on the subject. The video is around 10 minutes long. The instructions for the tricks are on an audio cassette. Don't waste your money!!!!!!
1,RIP OFF,"Total rip off.You can buy a 2 meter USB cable anywhere for $5 or less, but HP makes their printers so that only their cable with a non-standard connection on one end will fit, then they charge $20; 4 times what it should cost."
1,Where is it???,"I ordered an HP printer, which does not come with a cable, on Oct. 17th. Based on advice in the ad for the printer, I ordered the subject cable, also made by HP, in the same order. The printer shipped on the 19th of October. An ink cartridge for the printer arrived today, Nov. 15th, but still I still have not received the cable. I do not know how to rate the printer or the cable and I have already lost 30 days on the printer's warranty!! I sure would like to be able to rate the cable and printer. To date the order is 2 weeks late since it's estimated shipping date of Oct 28 - 29. I have not even been able to find a way to contact customer service to see if there is going to be a long lag time, in which case I would know that it would be wise to cancel and order from someone else. Bottom Line: Not satisfactory at the moment."
2,Not the old Ironman Triathlete sock,"I concur with others in rating this product that it is not the excellent running sock of the past. I still have some of the ones that I bought 6 or 7 years ago that were comfortable and durable - they had the name Ultimax, not Wigwam. The Wigwam sock are poorly constructed in that the heel is misplaced, too close to the ankle, so that it bunches up at the back of the heel. Even under the forefoot it feels like the material is not smoothed out. I'll keep using the old Ultimax until they are completely threadbare."
4,Bunny treats plus!,"When Kaytee began adding brownish/orange treat/cookies to their Forti-Diet Pro Health - Adult Rabbit food, my bunnies preferred the treats of course and would eat them first leaving a dish full of pellets. Reading the ingredients and seeing molasses as a sweetener; I finally found the Exact which has similar ingredients and they love it, now we mix the Exact with the pellets half and half and they eventually eat their alfalfa pellets and most importantly their Timothy hay!"
5,"""Lazz"" es la bella y nueva cantante salsera del momento","Hola a toda mi gente latina, llegó la nueva cantante de salsa ""Lazz"" con sus canciones de verdad verdad super-buenas, no tarden en comprarlo, ademas es una belleza, bye."
5,Recordar un increible amor...,"Entre flotar en las palabras de estas canciones lo lleva a uno a las memorias del amor de su vida. Trayendo de nuevo esas emociones y memorias tan lindas de lo que es el amor. Definitivamente, vale lo que cuesta, y debe ser parte de la coleccion de cualquier romantico."
5,LAZZ...LA NUEVA REVELACION DE LA SALSA.,"Lazz es una joven cubano-americana con una voz increible y una belleza impresionante. ""Aunque me voy"" es el primer exito de esta produccion titulada ""Completamente tuya"" para el sello Wea Caribe. Lazz tiene muy buena voz para la salsa y ademas tiene el sabro y el swing que este ritmo merece. Otros buenos temas de este CD lo son ""Tu mi hombre"", ""Completamente tuya"" y ""Villa Miseria"". Lazz por su talento tendra mucho exito. El disco esta buenisimo. Tambien recomiendo los siguientes discos: ""Pasional"" de Jessica Cristina, ""Que Hable La Musica"" de Marco Hernandez y ""Yo Vine A Cantar"" de Helena Santiago."
5,Felicitaciones,"Quiero felicitar Lazz por esta produccion. Sigue adelante tiene mucho talento El Señor les bentiga siempre, soy un fiel admirador esta hermosa muchacha. Juan Antonio Velez"
2,very poorly written,"I purchased this book hoping that the other reviewers were wrong. Guess what, they were right! This book was really bad! The only reason I did'nt give it one star was the storyline was intresting, but the writer did'nt know how to make the most of it."
1,don't BOTHER,"JUST ONE WORD ""GARBAGE"" i AM GLAD i ONLY PAID 20 CENTS FOR IT AND THAT WAS TO MUCH DON'T AND I REPEAT DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,WTF!,This book was straight up trash! This white chocolate broad needs to give up writing it's obivously not her thing!I wish I could give this 0 stars..even that may be too generous! UGH! SAVE YOUR MONEY PEOPLE!
2,Horrible,"Just like all the other reviews stated, this book is horrible. I am still trying to get through the book hoping that the plot gets better. But so far, I am disappointed. Do not go out and buy this book. It is a waste of time and money. I have read a lot of urban fiction and this one is horrible. I will not read the sequel. The author needs to improve on story plot handling and writing skills. I will read no more from this author."
2,Things that make you go hmmmmm??,"This book is one of them. It is the story of Duke, who owns Babylon a ""sex factory"", and Victoria a bi-racial rich girl, who has to go live with her Black grandmother when her White father is killed. Victoria is a nympho anyway and soon becomes the ""Dutchess"" Duke's right hand woman. She gets thrown into a world of sex and craziness in Babylon.The first thing that tripped me out was Duke's workers calling him ""Massa"" The other thing that tripped me out was Celeste, Dutchess' private part, that talks to her. This book was a really awful. The whole book is about sex, every chapter is a detailed explanation of the freakiness . I didn't read it all the way through I just skimmed through the interesting parts.I gave it two stars.... But maybe that's too generous! Save your money!"
1,yea... this sucks,"This book will make you feel like you are wasting your life.I couldn't even get through it, but I said to myself; ""I must be well versed in al genres of writing, even this new hip-hop-lit stuff."" However, this is worse than hip hop music. You feel society slipping off of the face of eternity as you read just the first chapter.Poor prose, poor word choices. The only vivid descriptions are of sex scenes, and even they aren't done with class or any literary skill. This book is also riddled with typos. White Chocolate needs to kick her editor in the teeth.Don't buy this book. Even though it's obviously marketed for young inner city girls, this is not the representation they need. Not for their self-esteme, not for anything."
1,I WANT A REFUND!!!!,"If I could give a book negative stars, I would have given this one negative 200. This is one of the worst books that I have ever read. I couldn't even get past the first couple of chapters. Not only did it not make since, it was just boring as all hell!!! White Chocolate needs to stick to the white side of her. When it came to writing the speeach of the characters, she tried too hard. I spent the majority of my time trying to figure out what the hell they were saying."
1,UGH !!!!!!,This is the WORST book. I couldn't even finish it. Even with all the sex scenes it was still BORING as Hell. Don't waste your money on this.
1,its just that bad,"i only purchased this book because it was published by urban books, and seemed like an interesting enough title. Now im furious because I couldnt read this beyond the first couple of pages. I wish I had the read the reviews first!!"
2,could Jane be any more depressing?,"This and the last book written by Ellen Hart have become progressively more depressing and irritating. I don't know whether Ms. Hart is suffering in her own personal life, but it is clouding her mysteries. What was once a well written series with entertaining characters has become a dark and gloomy series with characters you wish would just shut up and quit feeling sorry for themselves. Just be prepared not to enjoy this book if you've been a fan of her earlier works."
3,Lyme House Meets Gay Scream,"I did enjoy Ellen Hart's recent offering. However, I was dissapointed. I see this novel as an attempt to mix campy drama with slasher movie action. I found the whole, ""he's gay, is he gay? do they think I am gay? I was never gay before?"" dialog tirering. Too much dialog switching back and forth from beleiveable suspence to childish horror. This novel does not know what it wants to be when it grows up. People in Jane's arms dieing and everyday folks shooting guys with guns? There also seems to be a lot of (gender) stereo typing going on. For a more beliveable read I would recommend, ""The intersection of law and desire"" by Redmann minus the wacky ending. I hope Ms Hart will continue the series with more intelligence and depth."
1,Style Over Substance (and quality),"The picture quality is good except during fast panning even in progressive scan. A fast pan creates a slight stutter in the image which some may not notice but its there. A much worse problem is the DVD drives well know ""glitches"" when playing dual layered DVDs. Layer changes are slow skip frames. The worse problem is that the drive will occasionally just stutter during a DVD when there is no layer change at all. These problems are known by the tech savvy on the web (just do a search) and plague many of the Q50 in US and abroad. I returned my first one and got a replacement. It was better but not 100%. I then found a firmware upgrade which also seemed to help a bit. The bottom line is that this drive is not worth the hassles at any price."
3,Pretty good,"I have owned this player for 3 months now. The picture and sound quality are excellent. However, my player does skip frames very slowly during layer changes, and sometimes does this just ramdomly as well.It's an unfortunate problem, but at least it's a very good player other than that."
5,highly recomended!,If you're looking to learn how make simple circuts GET THIS BOOK! it starts off easy but by the end you'll be making your own circuts. I went from an amature to a intermediate in about three weeks. very easy to understand.
2,"Basic Electronics Course, for someone experianced","this book covers a lot of material and goes into much detail.but the author lacks in the ability to covay all of the materialin a way that is easily understood and readable. i spent alot of time rereading things because of the way things wouldbe explained and stated. explinations are refered to chartsand diagrams that are not well put together and labeled well.basic-electronic-course. reading that one would expect astep by step guide through explinations and some hand holding,but this book is far from that.this book should be renamed ""basic electronics course for theexperianced electronics engineer""."
1,not a good book at all,"i got this book and it was no help at all in teaching me electronics,it's not a practical book on electronics, it's mostly useless facts and theory very frustrating approach to electronics."
3,Not his best but great characters,"As always, Russo's characters are fantastic. The reality of the relationship between mother and daughter in this book is staggering. I couldn't believe how accurately Russo was able to display such a dysfunctional family - completed with separate points of view, excellent dialog and heart-wrenching sadness.The story lacked a punch that Russo's other books have - mostly Empire Falls, Nobody's Fool, and some others.The end of the book was a bit slow and it could have ended about 25 pages sooner than it did, but it was nonetheless very good.If you haven't read Russo before, don't start with this. But, if you're a fan, you'll enjoy it, if for no other reason, the characters and relationships between them are great."
2,Disappointing,"I liked ""Empire Falls"" and I loved ""Bridge of Sighs."" However, ""Mohawk"" is a disappointment. It reads like a first draft of ""Bridge of Sighs."" Many of the same elements appear in both books: a quiet boy as a central character, delinquents who extort money from their peers, a legendary fight that puts one boy in the hospital, a popular teenager who leaves home and lives in a flat above a store, a community poisoned by the local tannery. I could go on.Everyone has to start somewhere. As a first novel, this book certainly showed promise. However, Russo has found his voice in far better novels. ""Mohawk"" is poorly constructed and the characters are not particularly well drawn. (Why on earth would the beautiful, intelligent Anne marry a doofus like Dallas Younger?)If I were Russo, I would insist that the publisher move this book to the out of print list. I sure would like to get my money back."
3,"A first, but not best work","Let me start by saying that Richard Russo is one of my favorite contemporary authors. With that said, this book lacks what his later books are rich in - HUMOR! Russo is a very funny writer, but it doesn't come out in this book."
3,A brilliant author but don't expect Empire Falls,"Richard Russo has been compared to Cheever, Roth, Oats, Irving, along with many other great contemporary American writers. These accolades, especially post Empire Falls, are very well deserved. Mohawk, an earlier work of Russo's, shows his writing to be sensitive to real human experience and, at times, even compares with Empire Falls. However, a real pitfall in this novel is the plot getting in the way of his writing. It seems contrived to allow him the lattitude to develop his characters, something he can do as well as most living writers. But it keeps the reader in a dazed and even stumbling state. Luckily, for all of us who so enjoyed Empire Falls, he seemed to work out the earlier kinks. Simply put, if you have not read the latter, you will likely enjoy Mohawk. If you have, don't go back. It really isn't worth the journey in time."
4,yan4333@yahoo.com,Mohawk like many of Russo's novels depicts the demise of the capital district area of New York.Having grew up there makes it easier to both relate and remember the golden years of those areas.
3,A must for any Russo fan,"Richard Russo's first novel is set in a dying mill town of upstate New York, a setting which he has returned to several times since, and is peopled by the kind of small-town folks who urban sophisticates suspect should be dull but are, in his expert hands, as vivid and interesting characters as can be found anywhere in fiction. Here he focuses on two cousins -- Anne Younger and Diane Wood -- who are caught between aging parents, needy husbands and ex-husbands and, in Anna's case, a growing son. This is a slighter work than Russo's later fiction, but the elements which later came together to make Empire Falls a Pulitzer Prize winner are all on display here, and for any Russo fan, Mohawk definitely should not be missed."

2,what to do?,i could not get these to work on my mac?any suggestions? i could not find any suggestions to help me to get these hard to find disks to work with my mac
3,Not her best work,"I enjoy reading Anne Rivers Siddons' books primarily because she so beautifully evokes the feel of the South. That's the case in this book, set on a fictional island off the coast of Charleston, SC.This was a quick read, but I found her plotting to be a bit ponderous and some of her characters little more than cardboard cut-outs. Caro Venable is a strong heroine, but too many things happen a little too conveniently so as to stretch plausibility. Still, if you're a fan of Ms. Siddons' work, you'll enjoy this one as well."
3,Mediorce at best.,"This could have been a fine little novel, instead the author's heavy-handed plot and overblown prose mangled it into a mediocre piece of work at best (the author would probably describe the style as 'lyrical, deeply haunting prose that reaches into the very soul and foundation of fragile being-ness' -- and that would be just if one of the characters lost her shoes...). It's somewhat better than a romance novel tear-jerker, but not all that much.In the book the main character drank too much; if I had been married to her...I would have started drinking!"
1,gave this as a gift,I gave this as a gift. It came as a used book and it showed!!! Please let us know when it's used!
4,A novel about love of place,"This is a novel rooted in geography. I would even go so far as to say that the main character of Low Country is the landscape--the salty marshes especially. Caro's description of her natural surroundings shows not just her love for her particular space, but shows somebody intimately acquainted with the earth and its essential link with all life forms.The plot wore thin and the characters, for the most part, were stereotypes. Read this novel, though, to get a sense of how rich Caro felt connected to a particular spot in the geographical landscape. She was willing to give up everything to hold on to ""her"" island. I found myself just a little envious of Caro--I would like to have a geographical space to which I feel as committed. Unfortunately, I've lived in far too many places to allow any roots to sink deeply enough to draw the kind of nourishment Caro did from her geographical space."
4,the main character sleeps alot,"I'm a true Anne Rivers Siddons fan and I can honestly say I've now read every one of her books. Low Country did not disappoint me. The main character, Caro, could have been a little stronger. It seemed that she was taking naps or sleeping throughout most of the book."
4,A view of the low country was a bonus.,"I was surprised by the negative reviews of this book. It is my first read by the author, and I love it. So can I assume that I will be evwen more pleased with future reads? Ms. Siddons does a magnificent job of describing the countryside. I can almost feel the breeze off the ocean. A view of the low country was a bonus from this absorbing novel."
3,Flawed but well worth reading,"The story moves along and the Gullah community is depicted vividly and not condescendingly or sentimentally. Two strong reservations: 1. it's very badly proofread, especially for a major publishing company (e.g., Ms Siddons hasn't the faintest idea of the difference between ""whoever"" and ""whomever,"" and apparently neither does anyone at Harper, Collins); 2. One character, the heroine's son Carter, seems totally unnecessary utnil he pops up suddenly at the end as a deus ex machina to wrap up her plot."
2,Derivative,"""Low Country"" is a southern version of ""Up Island"": Southern woman burdened by family tragedy seeks solace in the simple folk of a coastal island, discovers her roots, laughs, cries, drinks too much, sleeps, eats great food, and comes to a happy ending. Yawn."
2,Long Tedious Sentences about Nothing,"The back of this book said something about flowery prose. Now I know what they meant. This woman can take 2 pages describing grass. Unfortunately, that is not my thing. I kept skimming and skimming to get to the plot -- which her excessively lush descriptions overpower. This book is about 1/10 plot and 9/10 desciption of Southern landscapes. I thought this book would be a fun, mindless paperback and even with that I was disappointed. This is the first Siddons book I read and it will be my last."
3,slow,I also was looking forward to reading this book and it took me forever to read it. It was very slow and had some very boring parts. I almost put it away more that once but I stuck with it. It did pick up finally it it was at the very end of the book.
3,Worth the time,"Low Country is the first book I've read by Siddons. While the first half dragged, the second half was so good I couldn't put it down. The descriptions of the people and places were vivid and enchanting. But the ending reminded me of The Horse Whisperer. It's too easy to have the good-looking, marriage-threatening hero die at the end. Then the author can end the book and the woman doesn't have to struggle with the question of whether she should stay with her husband or go with the hero, or take a break from both of them. But a good paperback to pass around."
2,Bland and predictable,"Too much melodrama in this novel. Too many over-the-top characters. My favorite is the Jewish-Cuban-with-an-Italian-name, who minutes after meeting the wife of his boss, calls him ""Mengele"" to her face. Come on! Although i read some very nice passages, this book is nothing more than a glorified romance novel from the supermarket shelf."
1,Up Island must have been a fluke...,"I loved Up Island. Now I have read Downtown and Low Country and I find it hard to believe that they were written by the same author as Up Island. While reading Low Country, and forcing myself to finish it I have come to the conclusion that Anne Rivers Siddons just cannot write. There were paragraphs that were so ridiculosly written that I would read them to my husband and we would just crack up. She introduces characters and forgets them (Lottie, Carter among others). She has another one transform while being out of the story for a few days (Sophia) and the most aggravating thing of all is the main character spends way too much darn time sleeping! This book made me crazy. Don't waste your time."
3,Caro Loved Her Island and Fought for It,"I've read many of Anne Rivers Siddons books. This one wasn't really my favorite of all, but it kept me interested enough to stick with the story.Caroline Venable had the lovely island plantation which she inherited from her grandfather whom she was very close to. But when her husband's company threatened to buy it out, and make a theme park out of it, Caroline had to fight every step of the way for it. But her fight won't be won without some hurt feelings along the way. Hopefully, she and Clay's marriage will survive her fight for the land."
2,disappointed in Siddons,"I have read all of Anne Rivers Siddons books, so I was eagerly anticipating this newest one. However, I was very disappointed. While this book hints at the rich imagery and phrases of Siddons's earlier novels, it doesn't come close to matching them. Caro is whiny and she goes into so many fugues where she misses her daughter that it gets annoying. If you want to read a book by this author, choose one of her excellent earlier novels and skip this one."
5,A great book!,"I was very surprised to see all the negative reviews for ""Low Country"". I personally thought it was one of Anne Rivers Siddons' best books ever. I agree with the readers that say that her genre is somewhat predictable, but that is what makes her books almost comforting. I, for one, like happy endings. I loved ""Colony"" and ""Fault Lines"" and put this one on the same level. She chooses her surroundings carefully, but her characters always seem to be a part of their area. Any woman who has been through a crisis that shakes her marraige to the bone and makes her grow as woman and a partner can relate to her books."
2,Trite plot with predictable ending,"After enjoying ""Colony"" so much last year I eagerly looked forward to this latest novel. I found I had to struggle to finish the book and was very disappointed at the lack of imagination at the end. Obviously this book did not inspire me to read anything further by Siddons."
2,Not nearly as good as the other Siddons' southern creations!,"I was very disappointed with Ms. Siddons' latest novel. Although I usually read her books in a couple of days (if not all in one night), the first half of this book dragged on. It did pick up during the second half, however the plot and ending were predictable."

1,camera bag,"When I placed my order for a Christmas gift I ordered a camera and the recommended Travel Kit came out during final processing. I thought it was a good idea to go with the camera. I thought I was ordering from Amazon, but that was not the case. The camera was from one vendor and the camera kit was from another. A week after my order for the camera I get a message it is no longer available. I have to find another source to purchase and in the meantime the camera bag arrives but is only for that specific camera now not available. I had to return it at my cost plus 10% restocking fee. Not happy and won't be ordering from Amazon in the future."
4,Hard to find,"Amazon, as well as many other sites were unable to fill the order for this item. I found it elsewhere, after much searching. Note , the bag is large enough for the camera and accessories. If you want a bg just for the camera, this one is too big. Good value for the price."
4,Good Starter Kit,This is a good Travel kit at a resonably cost. Has everything you need to get on the road including a rechargable battery.
2,An Ok product,"I bought this case thinking it was a travel bag for your camera AND the battery recharger, while there is enough room in the bag for the camera, it isn't shaped in a way that would make it a safe place for a small digital camera. I now carry my camera in a smaller camera bag, and then put it inside this camera case, the battery charger is easy to use, and does have adapters which I will never use, but are good to have.Overall it is a good price, just wish the case was designed better."
3,Unneccessary,"I bought this for my camera, but have found that it is much better to buy individual rechargeable batteries (such as Energizer) and use those with the camera. The Kodak batteries have a short life and eventually hold very little charge. Further, I would recommend buying as small a case as possible for your camera. It makes it much easier to carry the camera around and thus you are much more likely to take pictures. I've taken over 7,000 with my Kodak EasyShare CX4200 and I hope you get to take just as many yourself. Happy Snapping."
1,Charger and battery doesn't work,"DO NOT BUY THIS. Too much frustration. IT DOES NOT CHARGE THE BATTERY. Either there is something wrong with the battery or charger or the camera itself. Contacted Kodak about it, they sent another set (2AA NIMH Battery Pack NIMH & Charger) for free but still does the same thing. It charges for 10min then the lights go out on the charger indicating its done but when I used it in my DX4900 camera -only gets 3-5 shots then battery dies. I totally gave up."
3,2.5 stars.,"Natalie Page is one of the uncool set. She is not the prettiest, most popular, or smartest girl in school. She's not trendy or hip, but she is fast. Track gives her life substance and meaning, and the threat of losing it because she just can't get geometry is apalling. Forced to be tutored by a nerd, Matt, she feels even less cool. She tries to pass the geek off as her boyfriend, but he has a girlfriend already and one of the cool guys is acting interested in Natalie. Then, her verbal sparring with Matt turns into something sweeter and more special, and Natalie wants her lie to be true.** It's unusual to see a book, geared to any age, where the female lead is the one being tutored by the male. Seeing the paradigm turned on its ear is refreshing. This simple story will speak to the geeks of the world, who are left out of the cliques. **Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
3,yeah well I don't know....,"Okay- BdG is by far my very favorite artist. Tracks like Filling the Void and Drippy absolutely blow my gourd. He takes you on this slow ride, building, hesitating, building, almost there, and then wham- through the complicated sound tsunami comes this freaking breakbeat that makes your head spin and FORCES you to dance.Didn't feel that on Igezeh. I mean it's good. But it's no BdG good. Hard for Christ to have an impressive encore after the whole rising from the dead thing and it's hard for an artist to come back with amazement after a bull's eye like Magical Sounds.I would buy this album again though if I scratched the CD (always my rating of a good verses a great production).And for God's sakes- buy Beth Orton- all you can!ccm"
5,In the zone...,"I love it! ""Igizeh"" puts me ""into the zone""; what an outstanding piece of work by Banco de Gaia. I found myself enchanted with the opening of the first track, Seti I. Starting with the sounds of birds twittering in the Temple of Seti I at Thebes, layer after rich layer of rhythm, melody and the sounds of Egypt are laid down, building to driving dance beats. It's a three-dimensional feast of music and sound that I can't resist. Even if I am sitting down, my body starts moving to those grooves. Obsidian is just as compelling as Seti I. World fusion and dance beats don't get better than this."
4,Banco de Gaia does it again!,"The release of a new album by Banco de Gaia is always cause for celebration, and ""Igizeh"" is no exception. More beautiful timeless melodic electronica, filled with a mix of uptempo and mellow dubby dance beats and exotic samples and voices. I do have to say that I find the two vocal tracks to be the weakest songs on here. ""Obsidian"" sounds too much like a basic deep trance workout, and ""Glove Puppet"" sounds too much like Portishead. Not that these tracks are bad, they are just not pure brilliance, like the rest of the tracks. ""Seti I"" ""B2"" and ""Gizeh"" are absoluetly perfect, and the album as a whole is another brilliant addition to the legacy of Banco de Gaia. How many techno artists have put together 5 almost flawless albums. Do yourself a favor, buy this!"
5,An excellent CD that was lucky to make it intact,"The material on this CD is excellent, a good grab bag of what was then recent material for MOR, some of which I think is also available in video form on youtube (though it isn't spelled out as such). Lively, tight performances in which the band was feeling red-hot and soaring with exuberant creativity. Third Man On The Moon, Why The Fly?, and Time To Burn were a triple shot of awesome. Blue Garden compares very favorably with the version on How High The Moon?No malfunction or shortcoming with the CD in operation, either.The case was damaged when I received it, however. Perhaps I can thank the illustrious US Mail for that."
1,incredibly poor manufacturing. bait and switch tangs,"These knives are the worst quality you want in a knife - the tangs *appear* to go all the way through the handles, with what looks like metal pins running through the handle, but in fact the metal of the blade extends only 1"" into the handle, and the faux pins are mere stickers on the plastic handles. This is incredibly terrible design! The knives will literally snap if you exert pressure on the handle without exerting downward force on the blade at the same time. I snapped two steak knives trying to cut butter. That's right folks, these knives don't even cut butter."
4,"Great light, easy to install!","This is my second LED light system for my tank....it is very easy to use, works well on a timer, and puts off enough light for my 4.5 foot bow front tank....very cool looking!"
4,Take better family photos with the help of this book.,"If you find yourself wishing that the photos you take of your family were better at capturing the events and personalities, this is a great book to turn to for help. In a straightforward, organized manner, the authors demonstrate photographic techniques along with ideas for unique family shots. From chapters entitled ""Your Beautiful Children"" to ""Fun and Games,"" there are many ideas for new ways to capture your family on film. The photos that accompany each technique or suggestion are ones that were taken by real moms, with regular point and shoot cameras. Even the ones that line the family up to say ""cheese"" have a fresh way about them. Follow the advice in this book, and your trips to the photofinisher should be much more satisfying."
4,A GREAT little book!,I received this book shortly after my daughter was born and it has proved to be a great reference. It's not overly technical and is written in language anyone can understand. The advice and tips work just as well with a point and shoot camera than with a more complex one. You'll find yourself reading this book several times and picking up a new tip each time. A great investment!
2,A little OUTDATED!,"I was looking forward to getting some helpful insight on photographing children from this scarpbooking guru but I was disappointed in the quality of the book. The copyright of the book is 1999, however, the photographs that were used as examples looked very outdated- maybe even from 25 years ago if I had to guess. This book is VERY VERY BASIC. It talks about using flash, coordinating outfits, taking candid shots, using backgrounds, etc. If you are looking for ways to use the great pictures of your children or making the most of your camera this is NOT the book for you! Spend a few extra bucks and get ""DESIGNING WITH PHOTOS"" instead."
1,Mini my foot!,"Not a true ""mini"" mouse. It is about as bulky and cumbersome as the cheapy mouse that comes with bundled PC packages. Not at all suitable for small hands (or people with a hand disability) as it so claims. It may have fared better had Belkin omitted the word ""mini"" from its name. A hassle downloading drivers which were not easy to find on Belkin's site. Also, there was no USB-to-PS/2 adapter in the package; you'd have to call the vendor and special-request it which they ship to you standard. They don't expedite."
4,Great Compact Optical Mouse,"Yes, it DID only have a 3' cord (the newer model has a 6' cord). It's a very comfortable optical mouse, that I've had no problems with in two years. With the pointer speed set to its fastest setting, I even use it on the arm of the recliner in my living room! Can't beat if for the money!"
1,This mouse [stinks],I bought one and it started malfunctioning after one month. Got another one throgh Belkin's friendly customer service. Used for another month and now it stops working again. I wouldn't even borther calling them again this time.
4,"""Good"" Mouse, not ""Great""","I purchased this mouse because of its attractive price being it is optical. It was very easy to setup on my Windows 98 desktop, although I guess it is used for laptops. But at any rate, I loved the simplicity of this mouse.The draw back was the wheel for me. When ever I would want to scroll down a page and it would run over a drop-down list, it would change the setting of the web page and take me places I didn't want. This happens EVEN if the selected option in the drop-down list is NOT HIGHLIGHTED. But if you switch its mode to Default, then the mouse only allows you to scroll 1 line per scroll unit! That is too slow for me! Even if you change the Scroll Speed, it doesn't work if you remain in Default. It is not a major problem, but an annoying one. Other than that, this mouse is small and durable, which I prefer. I would rate it a 3.5 if I could, but 3 would sound too low. So I rated it 4 stars, especially considering its sticker price."
2,Not as mini as I expected,"""Mini"" is an overstatement. Looks to be about 10-20% smaller than a typical desk mouse. I was looking for something smaller for travel."
5,Works very well.,"I love this little optical wheel mouse and find it the perfect compromise of features and size to be both a good travel mouse and an adequate desktop unit.If you haven't owned an optical mouse yet, you'll be thrilled with the improvement that technology makes over the older mechanical, rubber ball variety. In addition, the scroll wheel on top is something you'll quickly get accustomed to using and then will never be happy without again.The only drawback to this mouse for me is the absence of a thumb button, which I use to ""page back"" while on the Internet.I think, though, that such an addition would increase its bulk beyond its current excellent travel weight and size."
1,ehhh,there are NO PICTURES in this book.. thats an instant turn off for me... so i dontated it to the library. I didnt get past page 1.
2,Won't use much,"I love cooking and cookbooks, and this is not one I will be using much. If you want to hunt down and filet your own sardines, and make your own homemade pasta for evry dish then you will love this book."
4,Just Wondering Why,"My very first impression as I opened the book was that the lettering was too small and very light. When you're cooking and are referring to recipes as you go along, big, bold, dark print is a lot easier to the eye especially as one gets older.Just wondering why -- this point was not taken into consideration when the print was chosen. There was even a write-up on the special print that was used, though I found it to be inappropriate and rather impractical.Also, I was about to make her pot roast recipe -- why does Marcella require us to use ""chopped,canned,imported,plum Italian tomatoes"" -- all 1-1/2 tablespoons of it? Why so little? Is it really worth opening up a whole can for that little amount? Why not just use the plain fresh plum tomatoes then?Just wondering -- if it was a typo or incorrect, unedited material.So far that was the only recipe I've checked. Thanks for listening to my comment."
1,blah blah blah yada yada,"Ok, if you're thinking of buying it, first ask yourself ""is misery really my friend?"" if the answer is ""yes"" then by all means go buy this book. Of course if you have to read it for a class as i had to, I suppose you have no choice but to get it. I would tell you what its about, but my brain is still not back to normal functioning after trying to make sense of this garble. I think the title sums the whole thing up to be honest. Crime is not the problem, it's the lethal violence that is the problem. The book poses some questions, also suggests some vague answers. Ugh. Ewe. Spit spit. Have fun!"
2,I thought it was dull,I like the song Where my girls at so I thought I would like the CD but it turned out I didn't. I thought all the songs were the same and it was boring to listen to.
3,cool!,I relly love one of their songs thet i always hear on the radio! it rocks! But I havent relly listend to their cd! So i give them 3 Stars
3,3-1/2 stars -- They grew up,"I never understand when artists self-title their second album, but anyway, the girls of 702 did mature on this album. While the subject matter hasn't necessarily changed, the songs are more accessible to EVERYONE rather than just the middle school/high school crowd.Another thing about this album is that instead of the girls taking turns singing lead, Kameelah does most (if not ALL) of the lead parts. And the girls can still produce gems like ""Seven"" and ""Where My Girls At"", which I don't think anyone expected to catch fire like it did. The rest of the songs are pretty decent with a few filler tracks (""Gotta Leave"", ""Tell Your Girl""). And as much as I like ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart"", the first verse doesn't seem to have anything to do with the rest of the song.But this isn't a bad record. It's slightly better than their first album, and I didn't hear their third album, Star. But then again, neither did anyone else, so I don't feel so bad.Anthony Rupert"
3,NICE,"702'S new album was very nice. All of the tunes were very catchy and seemed to be combinded with the right beat. The better songs include ""You Don't Know"", ""Finally"", and ""Where My Girls At."" Yes I would recommend this album to one of my friends."
4,Girl Group Solidarity,"Personally, I think this is one of the better girl group albums to issue out of the 90s. Although Star is their classic opus, this album was a strong display of their vocal strengths and urban-pop sensibilities. It still disappoints me to this day that they did not last for the long haul. Highlights are as follows:Where My Girls At?You Don't KnowMake TimeFinallyTell Your GirlGotta LeaveWill You Be OK?"
5,What an album!,"All I gotta say is this has to be the best Rand B album that I've heard all year. These girls got the beats and such silky smooth voices. To me, sky's the limit for them. They definitely established themselves with this album and I think they're one, if not the best female R and B group right now."
5,DA BOMB!!,"This cd is off hook! I love all their songs especially tracks 2,3,4,6,9 &14 they are way better than Destiny's Child. If you're into real R&B buy this CD. keep up the good work girls!"
5,Mesmorizing,This album is off the hook. The songs have the phastest beats and lyircs. Their voices are so well harmonized and I love this album. It's hot to deaf. I think everyone should try to cope it...yes it was worth the money I paid for it! That's a lot of money isn't is?
4,I still love this album!,"I thought that 702's third album last year just never matched up to this great 2nd album of 5 yrs. ago. I like the choppy sounding rhythms that dominate this album. Most of the album is entirely like that. Where My Girls At, Make Time, You Don't Know, Seven, that final song on the album, Gotta Leave and others are some very solid songs. And having Missy Elliott, Bag and Arnthor, Soulshock and Karlin, this Wilcher guy, Marc Kinchen, and some others produce on here made this a more excitable sounding album than the debut. The girls matured a lot on the songs and with the singing. I hope that 702 can make a better showing with their 4th one--the 3rd one sounded weak.This ""702"" album was fabulous!"
3,Forget it...,"I really like 702 but the CD wasn't that great. It was straight. I listen to a few songs on there, everyone else I know thinks it was tight though..."
5,da album is the bomb,yeah they did it again 702 keep up the good work and don't let these hater bring you down yo da best song is where my girl at
2,Awful!!--Sophmore Slump!!,This album was garbage. I loved their first album!!!!!I give this album two stars b/c the only good songs are where my girls at and song #3. THis album was obviously thrown together..it lacked something no it lacked everything..I want my money back.... Now I am no expert but i saw them on BET's 106 & Park and Meelah(the dark skinned one) was no longer in the group..they had someone else....too bad for them...she was the powerhouse behind the group any way..MEELAH! IF YOU ARE OUT THERE WHEN IS YOUR SOLO ALBUM COMING OUT!!!
4,A 702 Pull Through !,"This album has great production. They have great voices. Missy Elliott is a great producer to work with, good choice. Every song has good beats, although some seem to repeat the same direction on the verses. The best songs are ""Gotta Leave"" and ""You Don't Know"". Excellent tracks, maybe some other artists should try going the same dirrection with their creativity."
5,This is a very tight!,"I have really ben enyoying this cd. All I want to know is ""Where my girls at""?"
5,"THIS IS CRAZY GOOD. BUY IT, BUY IT, BUY IT",This CD is one of the best CDs I've ever heard. All of the songs are really good. You HAVE to buy this CD.
5,Son really does SHYNE,"Yo this guy right here got flow. Forget the Lil KIM Or Notorious Kim whatever or whoever she thinks she is (the album Notorious Kim ...) says about this guy. Yo son is nice. If BIG was alive, he would be like, yo this voice come from this little guy , yo I feel what you are sayin son, yo Puffy sign this man. Here it is Bad Boyz a bangin cut with massive lyrics. Commision bangs deep. ... THis album is good , a bestseller. Shyne got flow get the album. One Worldsend"
4,"Mean, Tough, and Bad To The Last Drop","Shyne's music shines. The back side of the album says it all. He's got that look of bad but soft hearted, it makes you wonder what he's like in the world of music and real life. Tracks 1,2,3,9,and 13 were great. The rest were average. What makes him stand out from the rest of rap artists is his voice. Although he sound like the Notorious B.I.G. he has his own personal style. This album's great!"
4,Shyne doesn't sound like BIG it sounds like he holds his OWN,"Shynes album is worth buying and he proves that he is his own MC and he's not imitating BIG. This CD has atleast 6 cuts that are off the hook, the others are decent. The production is a little wack but as a Bad Boy he held his own and any hip hop or rap fan would admire the fact that he doesn't have any guest appearances except for Barrington Levy and Slim from 112. Shyne's story telling is the best part of this album and it is so simple yet tight that he'll give Nas(fallen off story teller) and Big a run for their money. Not to compare them though but he's hot. With thousands of rappers in the game somebody has to sound like somebody somewhat. ( At first Ja Rule sounded like DMX or Magoo sounding somewhat like Q-Tip) So for the ones that are screaming Shyne sounds like Big, give him a BREAK!"
5,The great debut album reprise of a Shyne,"SHYNE LYRICS ARE TIGHT. THE BEATS ARE TIGHT, ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE CD. HIS VOICE MAY SOUND LIKE BIGGIE BUT HE SPITS HIS OWN FLOW AND HIS OWN CONCEPT. Dalton Higgins REVIEW SUCKS ALONG WITH LIL KIM WHOSE NOTORIOUS KIM ALBUM IS THE WORST BY A FEMALE SINCE HWA AND BWP. eVERYONE'S DEBUT TALKS ABOUT WHAT GOES ON IN THE HOOD,CITY , TOWN WHERE THEY ARE FROM. FROM NWA TO DR. DRE TO PAC TO NAS TO BIGGIE TO JAY-Z TO DMX. DALTON HIGGINS GET THAT S@#T A BREAK. THIS IS WHAT REALLY GOES DOWN. THESE RAPPERS AND LYRICIST ARE REAL REPORTERS AND REPORT TO THE STREETS. LISTEN TO THE STREETS, RECOGNIZE THE REAL. YO GET THE ALBUM ,EVERY CUT BANGS. GET THE ALBUM WORLDWIDE,YOU WON'T REGRET IT . ONE. WORLDSEND."
4,GIVE A NIGGA HIS PROPS...,"JUST CAUSE HE SOUND LIKE BIG DONT MEAN PEOPLE GOT TO HATE. I RESPECT THIS ALBUM AND A MAJORITY OF THESE TRACKS ARE HOT. SO LIKE I SAID, ""GIVE A NIGGA HIS PROPS"". FOUR STARS FROM ME IN NORTH BABYLON, NEW YORK......---ONE---"
5,One of the best rap cds in a long time!,"This cd is bananas! It is very rare to see a rapper hold his own on his cd--most rappers rely on guest appearances to ""shine"", but this young cat, clearly, showed that if you're good you only need a few guest appearances or in this case a couple. The cd has a lot of hot tracks like the commision, where Shyne combined his lyrical skills with a little bit of raggae style. There are so many banging tracks on this cd that makes it impossible to choose one or two tracks. What makes the cd even more enjoyable was the absence of Puff's background commentary-- he needs to stick to just being a producer. This cd is da bomb! Go and cop yours."
5,"Shyne is ""Shining""","Shyne's self titled debut album under Puff Daddys: Bad Boy Entertaiment is definatly something to pick up. With production from the Bad Boy Hitmen, Shynes debut is well worth the purchase. Lyricaly Shyne stays top notch and leaves the spotlight to himself (as you can see there are very few guest appearnces). Some of the best tracks on this LP include-Bad Boyz feat Barrington Levy, The Life, Its Ok, Watcha Gonna Do, Get Out, And Commission.Overall I gave this cd 5 starts due to its blazing production , and its top notch lyrics delivered by Shynes deep husky voice. Even with the critizism about Similarties to the late Notorious B.I.G. , Shyne proves he can stand his own ground and make an excellent intro into the Rap Game. Go Pick This Album Up."
4,Shyne Po,"Usually Gangsta rap is garbage but shyne makes u fell like ure there when he raps and you can feel his struggle, his hardships and what his life is about, that being said some may bash him but he is still very good lyrically and is a good MC."
4,SHYNE,I LOVE THIS CD. IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO LISTEN TO ALL OF IT BECAUSE I WAS ONLY GETTING DOWN TO A FEW BUT I LOVE IT. ITS RARE I FIND A CD WHERE ALMOST ALL THE CD IS EVEN WORTH BUYING. I WAS BLOWN AWAY WITH HIS WORDS.. ITS KIND OF DARK I THINK
5,Shyne - Shyne,"Shyne Po first came on the scene in 1999 appearing on ""Reverse"" off Puff Daddy's ""Forever"" album. Then in late 2000, he released his first solo self titled album.1. Dear America (Intro)2. What'cha Gonna Do? - 4.5/53. Bang - 3.5/54. Bad Boyz (Featuring Barrington Levy) - 3.5/55. Let Me See Your Hands - 5/56. Gangsta Prayer (Interlude)7. The Life - 5/58. It's Ok - 4.5/59. N***** Gonna Die - 5/510. Everyday (Interlude)11. Bonnie & Shyne (Featuring Barrington Levy) - 4/512. The Hit - 2.5/513. That's Gangsta - 4.5/514. Spend Some Cheese - 4/515. Get Out (Featuring Slim) - 4.5/516. Commission - 4.5/5Overall:55/654.5 StarsShyne does pretty well on his debut. He keeps it gangsta and speaks his mind on every track throughout this album. He is just another talented rapper that Puffy had under his grasp and let go. Cop this album and support the era when Bad Boy was still alive and kickin'!"
4,GREAT!,"Good raw rap material, you can tell shyne's keepin it real, and the beats are good, some songs could be tighter beat wise ... but itz good hard core gangsta [rap] free shyne!"
1,I'm sure he's feelin' REAL gangsta right now.,Pure Grade-A WACKNESS! This is the weakest thing since WATER! PROS: The packaging is recyclable. You can hang the Disk on your rearview mirror and get a few good laughs.CONS: Um... HIM! 15 Years will do him some good. Maybe he'll come out and do a duet with his cellmate boyfriend.
5,Wow,Still bangs. Lyrics and real gangster ish. A shame he lost his voice and was real. Had mad potential but made timeless near classic. Po.
2,You have to be polished before you can shyne,Well I won't go in to depth on how terrible this cd is. All I'll say is this; Bad boys is the only good song on the cd the rest is not good at all.
5,One of My favorite albums ever,This album is as real as it gets. This album is kinda crazy because it was Shyne's first album. He addressed a lot of things that weren't addressed as openly as he did it. He really gave it to you the way it is and if you are a rap fan then you would love this album.
3,O.K..,"this cd is ok as in gold ok it ain't going to sell 1,000,000 copys. you can not say he is no where near Big,pac,nas or jay-z.he better stick to what he do best....(letting them things go)"
5,Shyne rules,"OK so shyne is not quite biggie...who really is? Shyne shows he can hang with some of the best emcees out there and really delivers with his first album. The best part about the album is that it is all shyne...thats right not another verse is rapped by anyone on the entire album. The best songs are ""What u gonna do"", ""Bad Boyz"", and ""Bonnie and Shyne"". I also liked ""The Life"" because it really showed shyne's thoughts and such. Overall a great album that is a must buy."
3,Shyne is at least better than Puff,"Well I purchased Shynes new cd this morning and I wasn't very blown away. I loved his first single ""Badboys"" but most of the other songs are average. Shyne is an above average rapper but he doesn't ever really get past the subject matter that he is this big ganster. Another very odd thing about this cd is that there are no geast rappers! This is very rare considering his label is badboy. The best part of this cd is ""Badboys"" and the fact that puff doesn't rap on it. Maybe Puffy finally figured out that he sucks. Shyne is no biggie--that is for certain. But this cd is a step in the right directon fo rthe troubled Badboy label!"
2,Shyne talks about nothing,"I got this album a week B-4 release, cause a friend of minds works at arista records so I had a good chance 2 listen 2 the album without hearing anything about it. I must say Shyne has some moments on the album, but he just recycle the same street life story that rap groups like Mobb Deep been doing for years, but he not good as Prodigy. Unlike B.I.G.(Player), 2PAC(thug), NAS(teacher), or Jay-Z(baller) Shyne doesn't really reveal anything about himself in his music. I'm not asking him 2 make a confession on the album, but after hearing the album u have no idea what shyne is all about.The production was kind of lame, like damn why puffy can't make a call 2 timberland, Rza, Or Dj premier. I was expecting more from shyne since puffy paid big buck for him but he seem pretty average 2 me, something telling me the only reason puffy sign him was really just cause he sound like B.I.G. Oh yeah only 2 hot sogs ""Bad Boyz & it gangsta"""
5,Classic,"For anyone who truely knows and loves rap music, they know that this record is a classic. A record u can actually listen from start to finish all the way through. I havn't heard a solid, well produced, lyrical masterpiece like this one since B.I.G. ready to die."
3,Puffy gave Shyne all biggies unreleased lyrics,this guys style is exactly the same as B.I.G....sorry but this is way to much of a coincidince. Hes on the same damn label ofcourse puffy gave him BIG's stuff.-x|R
3,THATS GANGSTA,"i dunno bout all this ""shyne be soundin' like biggie"" nonsense. the dudes got his own voice and its slammin'. as is track 13. THATS GANGSTA!!!!!!!!!!!!! song is kickin' rad, i would buy the CD just for that song."
2,"Long awaited, Shyne turns out to only glimmer.","Undoubtedly, this guy has skills. From the release of his first single ""bad boys"", everyone waited to see the ""Shyne"". Unfortunately it seems that this album is one of those ""one trackers"". With the skills that Shyne possess, one would think that master producer, Puff Daddy would have really blessed this album with some banging tracks. It seems that the ""Shyne"" only turns out to be a glimmer."
2,I can't even give this CD away,"I only bought this album to hear ""Bad Boyz"", and in true Bad Boy fashion, they cut the song off too early. Really, Shyne raps best over reggae grooves like that one, ""Bang"", and ""Bonnie and Shyne"". The rest of the album is a yawner with all of the usual suspects (pushing weight, some songs for the radio, and an obligatory Neptunes track, ""N's Gonna Die""). The most surprising thing about this album is that it's under 60 minutes, something unusual for Bad Boy products."
1,Biggie try-hard,"this CD is weak.. why do you think he does songs like ""the Commision"" etc.. that's stuff that BIG used to talk about. This guy was hot because he sounds JUST like Big-- just no rap skills. Please dont buy this if you like rap music at all-- this sort of nonsense is poison to our hip hop culture."
2,Dull Shyne,"This album is your typical ""recycled"" rap album. Everything is recycled: rap flow, themes, beats. Shyne does noting to distinquish himself from any rap artist in the market. Call it artistic slump, stuck in that ganster mentality mode and the bases are even loaded.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ALBUM!If your looking for some quality production and lyrics buy Nature - For All Seasons. Otherwise, there isn't really any ground breaking music on the market currently."
2,Uninspired Machismo OR He's Not Gangster!,"I was pretty excited to listen to this album: I'd heard Shyne was really good from a coworker who has good taste in rap. To my dismay this album is soo whack! The beats are sooo weak and are repetitive and MIDI sounding at times. And as for Shyne's rap style: it isn't original. He pulls off a handfull of adept wordplaysin this album but it is mostly uninteresting, predictable, uninspired machismo. And he DOES sound kinda like Biggie on the beginning of the last 2 tracks!!! It sounds almost intentional..."
2,Don't buy this one.,"I've had this for two days now, and a few hours in I can't believe I'm seeing and hearing what's on this DVD. I have another DVD from Guitar World with Andy Aledort instructing. That DVD is just rock & roll, and Andy is solid. He clearly doesn't have the chops for this DVD, however. His playing on some of these leads is a complete trainwreck. He's got the chords down for the rythms, but his picking is terrible at times.I don't know of any other DVD that will provide instruction on these songs, so I can't recommend an alternative to this one. You can probably learn the rythm parts fine with this DVD, but forget about the leads. Sorry Andy."

1,tastes like topsoil!!!,"I was all kinds of excited to find sugarless, all-natural, INSTANT oatmeal cheap, in bulk. Now I am stuck with 6+ boxes of oatmeal that tastes very much like loamy topsoil.Caveat emptor!"
4,pleased,"I like this fragrance but, like many of Clarins eau de toilettes, is not long lasting.When I bought it was $ 22.95, a good price for it.I wouldn't buy for the new price of $33.19."
5,"Truth At Last, But What About Justice????","I just finished reading this book last night. A pager turner indeed. Mark Fuhrman definitely redeems himself with an expert account of the facts of this incredible case that has never been brought to justice. Why? Because of the immense cover up done by the Skakels, perhaps the Kennedy's and the entire Police Force. How scary that the police obviously did not know how to perform their jobs correctly, but even more scary is that they were bought off by the Skakel family. In fact, did the Skakels not buy off the entire town of Greenwich?? Seems to me they did. I feel for the Moxley family. Mr. Fuhrman did an excellent job with ""Homicide 101"" chapter, which outlines in great detail what should have occurred in a homicide investigation. I would love to see this case brought to closure and see the Skakels get what they deserve once and for all. Bravo, Mark Fuhrman for taking a stand and showing us the light!!!"
3,Murder in Greenwich,"My copy said on the cover,""The Martha Moxley case . . . solved.""It was not solved. Who did it was speculation."
4,I cannot believe that family money can so subvert the state,"Iread this book because I did not know about the case and was very impressed by the author's previous book, 'Death in Brentwood'. I read a great deal of true crime, but this is the first book to show that if you are rich enough, you can get away with murder. Furhman shows very clearly why Martha's case remains unsolved. Public apathy and the NIMBY mentality meant that even 20 years later when he was attempting to collect evidence all he met with was hostility and abuse in Greenwich. I could not put the book down and I very much hope that the Grand Jury will reach a proper conclusion, for Martha's sake and for her very corageous mother and brother. Would someone be kind enough to email when the jury decides, as living in England, I will probably never know."
5,Couldn't Put It Down - The book says it all.,"With the recent arrest of Michael Skakel I came to Amazon to see if there was a book re the Martha Moxley murder to get more information. I found 'Murder in Greenwich' and immediately ordered it. What a book! Mark Fuhrman knows his stuff, isn't afraid to tell the truth and this book proves it. I find it interesting that the very first review of this book on 4-22-98 is from a Greenwich resident and she only gives the book 1 star and blasts Fuhrman for writing it. This just reinforces the theory of the rich and powerful of Greenwich protecting their own. To the Moxley family - my heart goes out to you. May there some day be justice. Had Martha lived she would be my age and someone who I would have liked to have had for a friend."
3,Not to my expectation,"The book was well written, however at the end of the book you want to stop reading due to the fact it becomes repetitive and rewrites everything that was written in the beginning of the book."
4,Murder in Greenwich,I am perfectly happy with the book. It is in good condition and easily read.It's just what I expected.
3,Murder in Greenwich: Who Killed Martha Moxley?,"Even though the book was interesting, it was very technical. I would have liked some more insight and background of the people involved."
5,Finally-Justice For the Moxley Family,"Mark Fuhrman does an excellent job in laying out the case against the murderer of Martha Moxley, the ensuing investigation and lack of cooperation when and where needed which spanned decades. Power and Money can't protecet a killer if the right detectives are on the case! Nice Job Mark!...Author of ""The Guardian"" Frank Goff."
4,mark fuhrman performed a valuable public service,"When the recent news about the pending arraignment of Michael Skakel appeared, I became interested enough to rent fuhrman's book from the local library. I read it and then bought my own copy. I plan to use it as a reference to keep track of developments & characters in the case."
4,I learned a lot about this case that I never knew.,"I recently read the Mark Fuhrman book about the Moxley case. I first heard about this case on ""Unsolved Mysteries"" a few years ago, and ever since, it has intrigued me. Fuhrman's book is engrossing and gives specific facts and dates which help the reader to understand the events of the night of October 30, 1975, as well as a good understanding of the Skakel family. Some parts of the book were slightly overwritten, and somewhat sensational, but overall, the book was very informative and gave good insight into this unsolved murder case."
2,Good read however ...,"I enjoyed reading the book and finished it quickly. If you are interested in the Moxley case this is good book to read however if you really pay attention you will see how much he stretches in order to point the finger at Michael Skakel while downplaying or ignoring evidence about other suspects. He constantly accuses the police of making assumptions however toward the end of the book Mr. Fuhrman makes many assumptions in order to prove the Michael Skakel committed the crime. My opinion is that he is an average detective and a ... when it comes to writing. A much better book on the case is ""A Wealth of Evil"" by Timothy Dumas also ""The Other Mrs. Kennedy"" is a great book if you want to learn more about the Skakel family. If you read these books first and then read Fuhrman's I think you will agree with my opinions about this book. Also remember he was handed a confidential report called the Sutton Report..."
2,I'm gald its been broght to trail,The only thing I diden't like about this book is the fact it perpetuates the myth that Greenwich is a town full pshyco pathes bent on making sure a makeing a brutal murder remains unsolved. I can assure you everyone here was quite happy with the news of an arrest. The only reason people in Greenwich seem secretive is because they pay an extravagent ammont for privacy and its rather annyoing when its invaded. The situation with Mr. Fuhrman was damned if you do damned if you don't. If we welcomed his investigation then people would say we were raciest for sideing with someone who has such narrow minded view points. If we diden't help him everyone would assume we were secretive. I can assure everyone we're just normal people who felt just the same about this case as everyone else.
2,Murder in Greenwich,Nobody knows what happened to Martha Moxley except that she was murdered. Neither does Mark Fuhrman.
2,Another terrible book by Mark Fuhrman,"I should have warned myself before checking this book out of the library. I should have remembered the garbage I'd read previously by Mark Fuhrman, Murder in Brentwood. But no. I went ahead and got this book, only to be dissapointed and bored to tears by another great example of bad true crime. At least it wasn't as God awful as his previous book. In this book he actually wrote about the case, not just defended himself as he did in Murder in Brentwood. I can't really blame the guy: he simply was not blessed with the gift of writing. Mark Fuhrman is just NOT A GOOD WRITER! All the facts are there, yes; all the opinions are there, including his own. But the book is assembled in such an unprofessional and boring way that the book is unenjoyable. I warn every prospective buyer of this book: spare yourself!"
2,"Audiobook: Boring, answers little","Refers to AUDIOBOOK: Although this is a decent enough beginning to the case, it ultimately left me with more questions than when I started. It just felt... unfinished. I do acknowledge Mr Furhman's work, so I am willing to put the lack of detail down to the Audiobook editing. But I was left feeling unsatisfied. Perhaps the book was a better option."
4,Kennedy kin guilty of murder?,"On October 30, 1975, fifteen year old Martha Moxley was beaten about the head and neck with a golf club outside her home in the exclusive Belle Haven district in Greenwich, Connecticut. Her body was discovered the following morning and suspicion fell on her neighbors: Tommy and Michael Skakel, nephews of Ethel Kennedy. A cursory investigation followed, but no arrests were made. Former LAPD police officer turned author Mark Fuhrman follwed twenty three years later to see what he could find, and the local police and townspeople wouldn't give him the time of day. What are they afraid of? Are they protecting one of their own, or are they intimidated by the Skakels? Fuhrman proves himself an able investigator and author, and Michael Skakel was indeed arrested for this crime in 2000. (The heaviest suspicion was on Tommy Skakel at first). I hope Fuhrman's investigation has helped redeem this miscarriage of justice, and that Martha Moxley may now rest in peace."
4,ultimate justice,"such a monumental work and collaboration between individuals who were bent on justice.One of the great ironies of course is that Fuhrman - much maligned during the OJ scandal for his supposed racism - turns out (as does the brilliant Dominick Dunne) to be a real hero.This book moved mountains.Racism may be stupid, but murder is evil."
2,Have we forgotten WHO Fuhrman is?,"I've looked at this book, as I have read other books and articles about the Moxley murder. It's an okay book. However, I've been struck by who the author is. Is he on a redemption crusade? Does anyone remember just WHO Mark Fuhrman is? He gained fame and notoriety as the Los Angeles detective whose credibility was destroyed during the O.J. Simpson case. Why? Because he lied on the witness stand, about a myriad of details relating to his investigation of the case. Some of his lies related to his own admissions and statements regarding his hate for Black and brown people. Was he not charged with perjury stemming from his untrustworthy testimony at the trial? Fuhrman can write any book he likes; I'm simply suggesting that we remember that his lies, racism and willingness to perjure himself are some of the reasons he is no longer a Los Angeles police detective."
3,A bit too many pages for too little information,"Mark Fuhrman has turned out to be a pretty good true crime detective, in part, because he knows how a murder investigation should be done. His insight is a big plus. In this book, however, there isn't enough known to make it over 300 pages long. There is simply too much repetition of the same information. If the CT police had not done such a poor job of investigating, I cannot imagine that there would be enough information to write 100 pages."
5,Tori Sorianos review!!,My book is called Murder In Greenwich and it is about a murder of a 15 year old girl named Martha Moxley.The book is written by Mark Fuhrman.The case was never solved but i think its an excellent book because it gave alot of details.It also show pictures of where the murder occurred and also of Martha Moxley.The author is also an excellent writer.I recommend this book if u like Mark Fuhrman books or mystery books!I would not recommend this book to people that dont like murders or blood. ~~~~BY TORI SORIANO 16 YEARS OLD LINCOLN CITY OR!!!~~~
4,Wheels of Justice Turn Slowly- Very Slowly,"Fuhrman outlines the case in a clear, concise and methodical manner. It is riveting from the start. While Tim Dumas has a better writing style in Greentown, Fuhrman's book is focused on the investigative aspects. Fuhrman also explains in clear layman's words legal terms. Felt he was able to bring forth a logical conclusion even though attempts to subvert him were evident. As far as facts goes, it is clear the case was bungled from the onset."
5,Los Angeles lost one if it's greatest detectives.,This book will prove it! After reading this book you can't help but feel VERY VERY frustrated at the untouchableness of the Kennedy's.And only after this book raised such public awareness that the Mass. DA. Has pressed charges against Michael Skakel.Nice Job Mark Fuhrman!
4,Who Knew Mark Fuhrman Could Write?,"This is a great true crime story written with just the right amount of bile by the much maligned Mark Fuhrman. His style is crisp and engaging, and he not only ably retells how Martha Moxley was murdered, he also includes many anecdotes about how he was treated by the denizens of privileged Greenwich, CT. (not very nicely) while researching his topic. This bit of sociology helps the reader to understand how the citizens of Greenwich absolutely would not consider that one of their own had commited the murder, though it was plainly obvious that one of them had."
4,"A Fun, Casual Read for Cat Lovers","""All I Need to Know I Learned From My Cat"" is mostly a collection of one-liners about life's little lessons, as learned from a cat, with color pictures on every page. Some of these ""teachings"" are as follows: ""Sleeping is very underrated"" (my favorite), ""Stare unabashedly"" (my cats have this one down to an art; it's almost eerie), ""Flaunt your hair loss"", ""Make the world your playground"", and ""Recognize the toy in everything"" (and they do). This is a fun, casual read with mild humor that mostly cat lovers will appreciate. Ideal for such readers."
4,Cute cat stuff,"Cat lovers know that you can learn many valuable life lessons from the feline(s) that allow us to share their living space with them. Suzy Becker's cute, sweet and simple book only proves it. Any cat lover/owner will love having it."
2,Bad LCD,"I have the same problem as Joe. I bought this from Circuit City. The same night I bought it, the LCD starts messing up. First it gives me upside down invert text, other times, it gives me Big test where I can not read it right. I exchanged that one. This one dose not have the same problem with the LCD. This problem causes the LCD to not show up at all. It plays great but I want to be able to change to different songs. I can not change to different songs if I can not see the options."
3,almost there,"i really think that 3"" mp3 cd players are an almost ideal mp3 player as they can be quite small and quite inexpensive, but i've had three of this model so far and all have had the LCD either be defective right out of the box or within two days of use. plus it would be nice if this player was a little smaller. but unlike a full-size portable cd player, this fits in your pocket quite well. and 3"" cd's are quite a bit cheaper than virtually any other form of memory expansion, and cd-rw discs work great. the skip protection seems ok, but it would be nice to have a hold option so that you don't accidentally bump the player and affect the play. the pouch with belt clip is nice, but i would rather have a clip as part of the player as i don't generally wear an actual belt. i can't wait to find the right 3"" mp3 cd player, but without a working LCD, this one is not quite it."
1,What you get is what you paid for.,"I just got it from Circuit City and I discovered that this MP3 player is worthless...The mp3 decoder hangs very often. So you need to remove the batteries to ""reset it"". The button used as Play/Stop turns unusable when hangs.The functions included are helpful specifically searching thru directories for a file name (When you are lucky and the player decides to work).Basicly, if you look for a piece of hardware that will give you the pleasure to listen to your MP3 files, definetely THIS IS NOT THE ONE!!!Save your money and try another one!!!"
1,No Love,"Manual very limiting. I brought my daughter this for Christmas, it was a nightmare trying to find compatible MP3 files that would actually work with the player. MP3 files that worked find on several different pcs on a cd-r disc wouldn't work with this player. No web support found, this was a disaster."
1,TOO SMALL,"I bought this cd player last week and when it came in the mail i was shocked by its size. It DOSN'T PLAY NORMAL SIZE CD'S ""WARNING!!!"""
3,Daisy Pellets,"Good price for decent pellets. Daisy has a reputation for providing solid, basic pellets and continued to maintain that standard with this purchase."
1,Daisy pellets,Two of the boxes came open in transit and were smashed also. Lost some in the process.The problem may be packing the product. Too much space in box.
1,not the best,"These pellets aren't then best for anything but shooting at cans, not the best in flight, I would just get the hollow points, the do massive damage to small game"
4,Unique talent,"Little Big Town should hit the big time. If you are looking for a traditional country album, you won't find it - otherwise, you'll be pleased. They effectively switch between male and female singers in the same song. And their harmonies are heavenly. The female singers are better solo than the male singers, but they all can sing. There are a few songs with good, assertive lyrics. When the material is ordinary, like on ""A Thousand Years"" and ""Never Felt Love,"" the harmonies still add personality. And the fairly acoustic arrangements avoid sounding just like everything else on country radio. They're no Dixie Chicks yet, but when they can produce more material as strong as ""Stay,"" and when they perfect their sound, they'll be a force to be reckoned with."
5,"Vocals, Harmony, excellent sound!","If you took the Eagles and made two of them women...that's Little Big Town. Their sound is smooth and rythmic...the harmony is incredible...their voices blend fantastically! The lyrics are familiar enough to pull you in, yet fresh enough to keep you listening over and over again!...The sheer beauty of the instrumentation and vocals coming together is priceless...they are excellent musicians who have put together a top rate album! I'd buy it again...and again!"
3,A Good Beginning for Little Big Town,"This is a very good CD, but not a great one. Little Big Town's next 2 CD's are much better & very, very good. If you haven't listened to Little Big Town, check 'em out right away."
4,Getting Better Every Album,"Great album and I would recommend it to everyone. Keep in mind this is not ""traditional"" country. This is soft rock/country. If you want the best LBT album get ""A Place To Land"". Every track is great and that's awful hard to do. Best tracks in my opinion are ""Fine Line"", ""I'm With the Band"" and ""Novocaine""; but they're all good."
5,CD,I bought a Little Big Town CD. It came in perfect condition and it was a GREAT price. I will definitely buy CDs from Amazon again!!!!!!!!
2,A VERY spotted debut effort!!!,"I am always open to trying new cd's by new artists.....so I picked this one up today.......I was very dissappointed!! Yes, they harmonize nicely and share lead vocals....but their music is uninspired and bland. The ONLY great track is Tryin' which was also recorded by Pam Tillis on her THUNDER AND ROSES album.....but by cd's end, LITTLE BIG TOWN, proved to me they are not ready for the big time yet....they still need some fine tuning in selecting classier material with their producers...I hope their next effort shows this side!!! Crossing my fingers. If you want to buy a wonderful new cd by a new group, don't buy this....buy EMERSON DRIVE!"
1,"""I Liked Country Better Back When it was Ugly""","... While the boys and girls of Little Big Town may be nice to look at, they don't have the talent or the songs to make them anything more than One Hit Wonders. My recommendation: buy this album only for the inserts."
4,Wonderful harmony!,As I've come to expect from Little Big Town; this album is full of beautiful harmonies and pleasing songs. I would recommend this album to fans of LBT.
1,Fiction Rather Than Fact,"I have never heard of Stephen Cox but I have known Edward Brewster for more than 50 years. In all of those years I have never known him to lie or deceive anyone. I have heard Ed's story of the sinking of the Cedarville and his harrowing survival on numerous occasions. I know that he was NOT hospitalized after his rescue, nor, he tells me, was he interviewed by Mr. Cox. I have no idea why Mr. Cox would attribute inaccurate statements to Ed. The Cedarville collision and sinking was a disaster but to fictionalize the events makes one wonder why the book was written. The true story is a a dramatic tale without the need to fictionalize some events."
5,Kindle,"I haven't had much time to read in the new Kindle because I have been too busy finishing the books in my old Kindle. However, with my fading eyesight, I think the new Paperwhite Kindle will be even easier to read and am looking forward to spending a lot of time with it."
3,Disappointed,"I bought this book because it purported to define the ""tough"" words. I found that most of the defined words were ones I already knew, while a large number of the ""tough"" words went unnoticed. For instance: on the first page, ""puissant"" is defined, while ""palefreniers"" is not; page one of chapter 6 has 9 words defined (most were cognates) but no clue is given as to what the ""auto-da-fe"" mentioned on the same page might be. I could go on, but you get the picture. I would still read the book, but would recommend that one keep one's Larousse handy as the obscure vocabulary is hefty. I would not buy this edition for the vocab list as advertised; however, the unused space on the left side could be used by readers to add their own definitions."
4,A beautiful poetry collection,"Doty's sixth book of poetry shows his elegant and strong style while exploring both public and private life. These poems luxuriate on the tongue and in the mind, and boldly paint vivid images in the readers' minds. Winner of a Lambda Literary Award for poetry, ""Source"" is a delightful example of Doty's works."
1,Didn't increase my dogs interest in eating,I have an older dog that has never really eaten his food well. I tried this product and my dog wouldn't eat it.
5,Great,"My dogs love it especially the picky eater. I have a hard time getting her to eat her food. The vet said that she is just spoil, so I decided to give Sergeant's Sniffer Shake-ins a try, and she ate all her food the first time it was mixed in with her food."
2,shaky,"I have 3 dogs and sometimes they get a little picky at dinner time so I thought I'd try the shake-ins. Unfortunately, not one of mydogs was impressed with it. It did not encourage them to eat any more than just their plain dog food does."
2,hmmmm,"I bought this thinking I would treat my dog's food every now and then with it,but when i did they just walked away from it.Its not their favorite"
5,really great to listen/dance to,"This is my first Acosta CD set and I must say, I'm very impressed. I agree with some of the other posts that lots of double CD sets have a great first disc then you lose quality with the second. Personally, I like disc 2 more but that's because tracks 1 and 5 are what I love about Trance. Martin Roth's Shockwaves and The Thrillseekers remix are, for me, the two best on here. This is what Trance is all about, melody, with power."
3,More of a planning guide than an etiquette guide,"As a planning guide, it is thoughtful and sensible. Certainly, there is a fair amount of sound, practical advice offered. Refreshingly, there are numerous pointers reminding and advising one that the most beautiful or elegant weddings aren't necessarily the most expensive ones.As an etiquette guide, it is weak and the advice offered is too patchy to be relied upon.John Morgan offered more detailed, much finer, and far wittier wedding etiquette advice in Debrett's New Guide to Etiquette and Modern Manners: The Indispensable Handbook."
4,JEWEL THIEVES IN INDIA.,"Gable plays a suave jewel thief named Gerald Meldrick. While in India, he encounters an equally smooth lady crook named Anya Von Duren; both are after the same loot: a diamond penant owned by Duchess Jessie Ralph...This is a surprisingly underrated and entertaining sleeper in which both stars are seen in rare form. Their styles are light and assured, and even though the story is quite preposterous, the smart dialogue is made smarter by the expert comic delivery of Gable and Russell. The love story angle is hardly believable, but it doesn't really matter: Gable is in fine form as the thief (who is also a master in posing) and Roz is superb as usual. Their particular talents are exqusitely exploited in this adventure farce which was never meant to be taken seriously in the first place! Peter Lorre plays Captain Chang - who exploits the duo to the police inspector. But, alas, they escape - again ..."
2,Somewhat Stream of Consciousness,"""They Met in Bombay"" is a curious film because although Rosalind Russell and Clark Gable meet in Bombay, they seem to get a move on and wind up in several different places, trying out several different plot line developments. It's not necessarily a bad movie, but you wind up feeling lost because of all the upheavals. Features Peter Lorre as an Asian sea captain."
1,Ugh.,"I discovered this series almost seven years ago. I was six. I was in love. I bought, like, every single book in every single series and even started a fan club for first grade girls like me.And then, when I turned eight, I found Percy Jackson and forgot about this series.I picked them up again when I was eleven. And laughed. The writing is horrible, the storylines repeat themselves over and over and over and over and over and over (to the tenth power), and there isn't really"
3,Fairy Rubbish,"These books are dreadful. It is especially painful when you have to read them aloud - it is an endless series of ""Rachel said"" and then ""Kirsty gasped"" and then ""Rachel chuckled 'Oh Kirsty"". The plots are weak and the fairies are equally pathetic - why don't they use their magic powers in a more productive way?But what can I say? My five year-old loves them and so the names Fern, Saffron, Amber etc. have been permanently embedded in my brain.I would advise you to introduce these books only when your kid can read them alone."
1,One star is too many.,"This is the worst scheme and the most disrespect from corporation toward parents since people had to line up and purchase Cabbage Patch dolls. Picture yourself having to explain to your child why you cannot finish the book. There is no ending to this book until you buy six more at whatever cost to yourself. Picture having to explain greed to your child, pyramid schemes, chain letters, and the like. Run screaming in the other direction. Buy some other book."
4,Ruby The Red Fairy,Ruby The Red FairyRuby The Red Fairy is one of my favorite books. The auther Daisy Medows does a graet job at saying how the person feels or what the persondoes.I think that anyone who likes adventures you would like this book a lot.The main characters are Rachel and Kisty. They find a fairy and they dont know where the other fairys are. So they go on a serch for the rest of the fairys.This book is kind of like Magic Tree House because they are both adventurous.
5,Very good experemental music,"Yes, this is not various artists - all tracks written and produced by single music band called physics, the disk is called Physics2 (refer to mp3it.com). The music is great - if you like such kind of music - if you could call it music. Live drums and guitar playing is combined with electronica - very few notes per music track."
4,Everything we were looking for!,"I am very particular shoppers and spent FOUR HOURS picking out the perfect set. Price wasn't an issue, but I was lucky this was so affordable! I was looking for a bowl that we could actually eat cereal and salad in -- and basically nothing we found could accommodate actual food in it. I was also looking for something with a great coffee mug. Emeril dinnerware definitely delivered. It had HUGE bowls and HUGE mugs which were perfect. The Linen white was the right amount of plain. The quality is also wonderful -- its stoneware so its incredibly durable. A bit on the heavy side but its ok, not impossible to carry. I wish they had smaller plates to compliment the set, however. It gets hot when you put it in the oven for a while (it is stoneware, afterall), and when you put it in the microwave. Its wonderful overall and defintely worth it!"
5,Solid speakers - great alternative to real surround setup,"For what it is designed, the speakers are top notch.Pros:The pros are fairly obvious: space saving, great look, no cumbersome wiring, the surround effect is clearly separated, AND it is NOT dependent on room configuration.Additional pro is the sound quality: Mid range is wonderful, jazz and vocal sounds have the fullness you'd expect from Polk Audio. Treble is crisp without breaking. All-in-all, the sound is sufficiently top-notch even for someone who appreciates good sound systems (except for some of you serious audiophiles).Another pro is the speakers are strong enough to handle enough power for a sizable room, say a 20x20 room.Cons:The cons is pretty obvious too. It is not real surround, so it does NOT give 360-degree feel to the sound field, but rather gives about 180-degree feel.Note that you will need to add your own subwoofer that has sufficient power for your room size.Bottom line, I am very happy with this purchase."
5,Nice Speaker,It's hard for me to tell the surround effects. With a good sub it makes great sound. Much cheaper than other similar designs. Easy to mount. Drilled through the wall to hide the wires.
2,Polk Audio SurroundBar Speaker System (Single Speaker) - Titanium,"Good looking but lacks ""umph"". Not as good at simulating Surrond as I hoped for the price."
2,2 stars out of 5,"I'm in the mist of a Korean-American book craze and was excited when I came across this book since I too am a Korean female. Unfortunetly I was disappointed with this book because I was expecting to read a narrative story rather than transcripts of several interviews focusing on Dora Yum Kim's experience as a volunteer and a social activist for the Korean immigrant community. If you're expecting to read about her personal experience as one of the very first American born Koreans in the early 1900s.. you might be disappointed. Its sort of interesting though because she sounds like a compassionate, tolerant non-Korean American. I was also quite annoyed with the author and her Jerry Springer like ""final thoughts"" at the end of each chapter, it just didn't seem like it belonged there, just wasted pages. I'm not going to give up though, my next read will be Quiet Odyssey by Mary Paik Lee."
2,It is cheap for a reason,"This kit was purchased with a battery operated timer, also by Raindrip.I have a fair amount of experience with plumbing and different threads and this fact did not help me with the leaks in and around the antisiphon, 1/4"" hose adapter or flow regulator. No combination of washers could eliminate the leaks in the swivel fittings. At least it only leaks during the watering periods, the valve in the timer is water tight."
3,Not as advertised - not 1/2 inch,"Although this product appears to be good, it is not 1/2 inch tubing as advertised. It is 1/4 inch."
2,Parts Missing!! :(,"This is the second box I purchased. The first box had everything. The second is missing some important pieces: one 10 gph flow control, one filter washer, one 3/4-inch hose thread swivel to 1/2-inch compression adaptor"
1,sucks with windows xp,"hey looked cool but this player is is not compatable with windows xp, great value but for everyone that just upgraded, or soon will upgrade to windows xp, you will want to smash the stupid thing against the wall. it is very frustrating and i keep banging my head against the computer screen. there are no drives to be found online and no help in the manual. it doesn't even say ""not compatable with windows xp"" on the box. what a mistake this product is, i just wasted two hours of my life trying to get it to work, don't buy it!"
4,Love it and its easy,"I loved this unit, its light weight and easy to use (the lock feature is handy when in your pocket).Other people have given the work around for XP, i would return XP before this player anyway.The main reason i am reviewing this product is to let folks know that if you have Nero and their MP3 Pro plug-in you can compress your files way down. The first set (not re-compressed) i got 18 songs. I compressed those with mp3pro (80kbit,44100hz stereo) and added 10 more for 28 total. Then i made a play-list in mp3pro (64kbit,44100hz stereo) and im at about 30 tunes with some space left. Not loosing any quality that i can notice.Bottom line is I've read really bad reviews on some of the high end units and this one is good for the price. As all us electronic buffs know the price on this technology will come way in the near future.99.00 is lot to spend on a unit that will be 20.00 in a year, but not as bad as spending 299.00 an one that will be 49.99"
4,Working With WinXP,"For the cost of this player, the quality couldn't be higher. Though the lack of documentation is frustrating, if you know even a little about computers, you can figure the player out. If you're running Windows XP, this device does not ship with support, and searches on the internet turn up no help...I hope this helps with your purchasing!"
4,MP6400 - Fun & worth the price,Just recieved one for Christmas. I like that it comes stock with 64MB of storage + can use a smart card. Instructions are a little unclear but you can work through it. Buy yourself better earphones as these 'buds' are a little hard to use.
3,Decent machine but CHEESY,"It works well, but I've seen better construction on a happy meal toy. The battery and SMCard lids are awkward and hard to open and are made of a plastic that screams 'I'm gonna crack'.One word of warning to people that own an Olympus Camera like I do. Do not use the SM card in this player unless you have a card reader that can re-format. The MP6400 uses a proprietary format scheme and may screw up the card - even if you say NO to the MP3 manager's query to format the card their way. If you use a Olympus BRAND SM card and this happens, you may no longer be able to use the 'panorama' feature, even after re-format."
2,returning as I speak,"I never even got to the point of listening to it. I unpackaged it only to find I had to hang it from my neck while working out. I jog and do other exercises that would prohibit using this. Also, I have come to use MS M player as a standard and this unit is not supported. All this on top of the fact that the casing seems awfully cheap, I feel the extra $... would be wiser to spend on other units that will meet my demands."
1,Obsolete No Drivers,"I bought one of these at a Flea Market today for $3.00 dollars. I can NOT find any drivers for it to work on my XP USB. I am glad that I only throw away $3.00. I found a supposed link to a site that had drivers, but that site no longer exists. BEWARE!"
1,HORRIBLE!,"I always thought that Classic was cheep garbage. Well, they have proven my point. My sister got one, and what happened, it crashed my computer! I had to do a complete system recovery and lost all my files. DO NOT USE WITH WINDOWS XP."
1,Unfortunately,"It didn't work with me. After two rounds of the presence process, I developed major depressions, panic attacks and anxieties."
1,Review of first 40 pages only!,"I couldn't get even past the first 40 pages. According to the author it appears that if you smoke some peyote you become totally present. Now he goes on to find a way to have that feeling of being present without the peyote and it just gets boring from there. The author admits in the book that it is wordy and repeats itself quite a bit and he defends that quite a bit in the first pages of the book. That didn't make it any less boring for me. He claims that in order for stuff to sink in to the subconscious that it has to be repeated. Well, I'm not a toddler and I was bored to tears. This book is New Age to the 10th degree. If you like that, it's the book for you. I have to admit that I didn't finish this book, I skipped around a little bit and did read the first 40 pages in their entirety. I think I got far enough into it to make a review though."
1,already been done,"I believe this book covers themes that have already been done, and done better, in other books.It read like a book report. Save yourself the money."
1,The dumbest book I have ever almost read.,"The subject is just meditation, but you don't find this out until after many wasted hours of difficult reading. Waste of time and money, in fact I wouldn't read this thing if it was free from the library."
5,Presence Process Experience,"The Presence Process is a well structured synthesis of transformational tools acquired during years of personal experience by the author. It's an exceptional read. But its uniqueness and power come through the genius of the ten week Presence Process that allows the reader to access to the Presence 'experience'. The access key is a simple breathing technique. With this as your start,The Presence Process leads you step by step to discover the source of your 'reactions' and shift to 'responses'. I'm on week three and I'm making major shifts. Michael suggests it's best if you are ready to do the work on your own, as opposed to doing it for show or talking about the concepts. If that's were you are, the Process is there. To say ""it works"" really doesn't do it justice. I would throw out all my other tranformational books that I have collected over the years and keep this one!"
4,Presence Process,I really enjoy this book and the simple language used. It is easy to read and has lessons to follow to help make your journey into the present easy and enjoyable. I am also reading A New Earth by Eckhart Tolle and find that reading these two books together really enhances my experience into the present moment. Great books for inner peace. I would highly recommend both of these books.
5,excellent mattress,Fast prompt shipment. I have trouble with my knees and hips and this mattress has helped me sleep through the night. There's no more pressure on the knees or hips to wake me up in the middle of the night. Wish I had ordered one sooner.
3,"Not for you if you are looking for not sinking ,firm support",I bought this piece in full size for my daughter bed who is 4 now.It is still good for her but if I (140 lbs) or my husband lay on it(176 lbs) it sinks your heaviest parts and compromises your breathing. IT is hard to roll on the other side if you want as well. Now that I am pregnant it is impossible to sleep there unless I am sleeping in a semisitting position with a thick pillow behind my back .It is hard to get out of the bed once you have been on it for a while.If I knew it at the begginging I would pick a firmer mattress and may be avoid that kind of memory foam.My older Sealy mattress ( not a memory foam )has a lot better support and we get a better sleep on it.
2,Needs help,I want to be fair and say that if anyone gets help from this book great. I found it to be lacking and a little over inflated with the author's ego.
1,Bad fuzzy monitor,"Buyer beware! This monitor is rated .26x dot pitch, but believe me, it is not! Check the tech specs at numerous retail websites,and check them at proview's site. They're all different.If you buy it, you'll have to call proview's rude tech support to install a driver!"
4,Eclectic jazz influenced melancholia,"Released sixteen months ago and reviewed but once. Very strange given that we have here a talented singer, interesting, if eclectic arrangements, together with well-written poetic lyrics. This is music for a dark, rainy afternoon. It is for contemplation, alone. Once again the influence of Nick Drake is apparent. In death this barely heard English troubadour has certainly had an enormous influence. If you enjoy the Pernice Brothers, Mercury Rev or the Lips give these fellows a spin. Standout track is #6, Little Pink House with vocal assistance from Julie Monley- the guitarist's sister. She is apparently a Denver Jazz singer. She has a beautifully sultry voice and is worth keeping an eye on."
3,Very different...,"This latest release by Michel Sanchez (1/2 of Deep Forest) is quite different from his other works. If you are looking for something like his 1st solo CD, 'Windows', or Deep Forest, you'll probably want to skip this one. This has a sound better described as 'acid jazz'. You can hear samples of this CD at Deep in the Jungle ...."
5,Great fun for open minds,"I haven't had such fun from a jazz (or jazzy) album since i heard ""Adventures in Radioland"" by Mahavishnu. Unfortunately at that time John McLaughlin didn't continue the ""adventures"" path of experiment. Now you can here this mix of jazz, arabic, spanish and god knows what other elements and enjoy the professional and really creative work of Sanchez. It's not a commercial-folk records, it's pure inspitration. I Strongly reccomend it to anyone who thinks music is dead..."
2,Massive disappointment,"Michel Sanchez' second solo album was a big disappointment for me. His first album ""Windows"" was fresh and clearly rooted in the Deep Forest tradition - Hieroglyphes is nothing like it. It's a quite unmelodic jazz album which seems to have been put together fastly in the studio, almost like a jam session with Sanchez on his usual keyboard sound that becomes very tiresome after some time. Very few of the Deep Forest trademarks are present here, like the great melodies, terrific harmonies and modern rhythms. A great example of Sanchez/DF at their best is track one on the ""Pacifique"" soundtrack which shows that they still can make wonderful melodies that goes straight into your ear and stays there. ""Hieroglyphes"" hasn't got any of that."
3,Falls Short of Expectations,"Despite significant public interest in the role of the CIA in the ongoing war on terrorism, this most recent book by Ronald Kessler falls short of expectations. The ""flow"" of the text is disjointed and oftentimes leaves the reader wondering how the author transitions from one paragraph to another. There is clearly a political bias present in the book, as opposed to an objective presentation of the unclassified facts as they are known today. While some parts of the book are fascinating and well written, I oftentimes wondered how parts of the manuscript ever passed the editor's overview process. This text could have been so much better and provided a much more credible review of one of our country's most prized assets, the CIA."
1,Kessler's Dream World,"Beginning with a rather flat and boring history of the CIA, mainly recycled, sometimes word for word, from his own previous work, Kessler segues into a blindly adoring hymn to Tenet and Bush. Tenet may well be a good leader, a good manager, and the right man to regain the Company's credibility on the Hill, or (or ""and"") he may be a shameless smoozer,and trimmer. How can we tell, when Kessler presents only the good and cavalierly dismisses the bad ? This book is infuriating, a shining example of one-sided partisan propaganda, and a waste of good paper."
3,boomer sooner,"Instead of providing great insight into the ""secret campaign against terror"", the author decides to give a very pro-republican view of american leadership with respect to intelligence. The author keeps his train of thougt for about one page, then gives a page of background or set-up, then another page of his original thought, then another of background...you get the picture. While the book contains some interesting facts there are definitely much better books available about the CIA."
3,Somewhat misleading title,"""Inside the Secret Campaign Against Terror"" makes it sound, at least to me, that the book will concentrate primarily on the battle against Al-Queda. However, Kessler doesn't get around to that until about 2/3rds of the way in; the first 2/3rds are essentially an overview of the history of the CIA from its inception; not that that isn't interesting, but do I really have to read about the Bay of Pigs and Irangate again? Also Kessler's writing style is dry, lacking flair, which shouldn't surprise me since he comes from a newspaper background. Overall, a mixed bag. For those interested in reading about the battle against Al-Queda, The Cell (the authors names escape me for the moment, but do a search and you'll find it) is far, far superior."
2,Bush apologist,"This book had some interesting background info on the CIA. Unfortunately, all but the last few chapters are nearly identical to ""Inside the CIA,"" a book the Kessler wrote 11 years earlier. ""The CIA at War"" lack a central narrative--it's filled with short choppy paragraphs. It's is a sometimes-interesting information dump. In the final chapters, Kessler defends the necessity of the invasion of Iraq and the Bush administration. I lost all faith in the book after that."
3,So-So,"You can tell this is written from an outsider. No matter how much access he had to ""secrets"" he doesn't understand what he is talking about like someone who has done it as their career and written about it from the inside. The beginning of the book is very hard to follow and repeats information, often in random order. Names are thrown in so fast it is hard to keep track of who he is talking about or what the person's job is/was. It does settle out toward the middle and becomes pleasantly readable until the end."
2,Disappointing,"This reads like a book rushed into print not long after war in Iraq was declared officially over by the President. As noted by others here, much of it is pastiche history of the agency seemingly slapped together rather haphazardly. The rest of it is a genuflection to Georges Tenet and Bush. What caught my eye is that Iraqi weapons of mass destruction are a given in the author's view up until second to last chapter, where their absence is dismissed rather cavalierly."
2,As much as I wanted to like it...,"The above reviewer had it right with the terrible production-this is more like live in studio or demo recordings than a finished recording, and the drum machine is really awful. As a big fan of JB--especially the early stuff--I hoped for some of the same clever wordplay and funny concepts of the early work (like A Scandal in Bohemia or the great stuff collected on Draining the Glass). Aside from a couple high points this really doesn't live up to that standard. Also, as the earlier reviewer mentioned, JB sounds liquored up on a few of the tracks to the detriment of the vocals--this used to be a good joke, now it's kind of sad. Good for them for getting together again and best of luck to them in putting out another record together, but I'd recommend passing on this and getting some of the classics or waiting for a full-fledged effort complete with professional prodcution."
1,don't bother,"If you know anything about massage (I'm licensed) you will see so many bad technique examples its disheartening. Adding to that the material covered is so basic and hardly sensual it doesn't provide any useful techniques even if demonstrated well. Its all watch and learn too, no real discussions on how to do strokes or why anything is being done. get a basic book or just watch a few you tube videos and you will learn everything here.BTW: If you are looking for anything specifically sensual, I rate this a solid G for general audiences."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I'm guessing the positive reviews posted here were posted by the some folks who worked together to make the video. This video is the lowest quality you can imagine. The camera work is awful, the music is 4 chords repeated over and over, the narrator has a high unpleasant voice, the edits are horrible and the massage instruction is worthless. Please, if you are smart do not buy this video - you will thank me for this advice. Absolutely horrific and by the way not sensual at all. The number 1 rating on this cover is a joke."
2,"Where is the ""sensual"" in this massage?","I thought getting the video and giving my husband a ""sensual massage"" for his birthday would be a nice gift. This was relatively boring, not great massage techniques and definately not very sensual. A big disappointment. Their idea of sensual was showing many minutes of massaging the arms and shoulders. The massage therapist wore a bath robe and the man a towel, nothing much about techniques, mood or setting."
1,waste of money,"Please do not buy you will learn nothing. It is only good for the man getting rub on the tape. It is boring to watch and will not help youplease a man or anyone, Dont waste your time or money."
2,"don't buy, looking at the cover should give away its not worth ordering, wish I noticed that","I ordered this video, because it had a very appealing title. this video quality is quite low, the max volume level is low, I have to hook up speakers to hear it normally through my lap top, the lightning is yellow weird, and the most important massage TECHINQUES is not explained, if I wanted to see somebody being given a massage at a home setting Id buy this video, but I wanted to learn techinques and see them from a close up, NO good close ups at all."
5,The Best Around,I don't personally have this cd (yet) but one of my friends paid the 30-40 bucks for it and says its the best cd he has!
3,this cd is crap,"ok, for all you happy hardcore fans out there, DONT GET THIS CD!!!! you may notice in Anabolic Frolic's cds, you may notice it says "" if you lke this, then try these"" DONT GET ANY OF THESE 140 BPM+ CDS. none of these songs ever get up to the 140 bpm limit. but if you like jungle/london oldskool then check it out, but happy hardcore lovers, STAY AWAY"
5,works great,I purchased this clipper a month ago. I used it to trim my mini schnauzer and shizu. It worked very well.
4,"Great Clippers, However...","These are very sturdy and easy to use, however, they don't come with comb guides. I had to go buy those separately and they were about $35. However, compared to paying $60 to have my dog groomed every few months, it is worth the price."
2,military guide,"The book was as advertised, however, it did not have the publication date listed. It was an older one and may not be totally accurate as these benefits change from time to time."
2,Military ripoff,"If you spent 20 years on active duty, this book is accurate, but you got all of this information when you left the military. If you had combined active duty and reserve/Guard or just reserve/guard experience, this book is misleading at best and just plain inaccurate at worse. Unless you were injured on active duty, there are very few benefits for the reserve/guard until you hit age 60, which the book fails to tell you. Sure, you get to shop in the high-priced Exchanges and Commissaries if you live close to them, and there is a slim possibility of Space Available travel, but the inconvenience makes going commercial, even with security at the commercial airports, easier.Another ripoff of the part-timer military community."
2,No new material,I was dissapointed in this book because it did not tell me anything I did not already know from the internet.
3,This book is not complete!,"Mr. Michel's book is not complete without describing what the Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Act, (10 U.S.C. sect 1408, et seq.), better know as USFSPA has done to over 200,000 service men and woman since it was enacted into law in 1982. The author briefly mentions ""Garnishment of Retirement Pay"" on page 73 through a discussion of child support and alimony payments. However, he fails to mention USFSPA allows state judges in all 50 states and US possessions to treat military retainer/retirement pay as common property by awarding ex-spouses for life up to 50 percent of the members' hard-earned pay. This ill-conceived law has financially devastated our men and woman who have honorably served this country.Could it be that Former Member of Congress (1967-1997) G.V. Sonny"" Montgomery who wrote the forward for the book was too embarrassed to admit that he voted this law into existence over 25 years ago?"
2,Mislead,"Thought that I was buying a book, largely written, or compiled by ""Sonny Montgomery"". Book somewhat outdated. Nothing new that hasn't been published in a number of military veterans publications and newsletters. Could have purchased it in the local Air Force Base Exchange.MSgt Kenneth W McNeelyUSAF(rET)"
2,Great if you're active duty or a potential recruit,"I was somewhat disappointed by this book. A veteran of three military services (but not retired), I had hoped to find some information about Veterans' programs. Instead, I found about 90% of the book to be useful only for currently-serving personnel or young men contemplating a military career. For those individuals, this book is great. For those not currently serving, I found it lackluster and loaded with information any military man could find on base with little trouble. Would I recommend this book? Not really. Would I recommend the military as a career to most young men? Absolutely. Save your money. Enlist and talk with the on-base career advisors instead for much more current information."
4,Military Review,Lots of good information for those that are about to retire or have questions concerning benefits.
3,The Military Advantage,"I would recommend this book for active duty officers and enlisted personnel only. I am in the Retired Reserve and was looking for a comprehensive book on the concerns/benefits of the Retired Reserve, and this book does not address the concerns/questions of retirees and is more appropriate for active duty personnel."
4,Title is well suited this is a Comprehensive Guide,Very good refernce tool for retirees a who wish to know what exactly the benefits of their service are. It provides direction to other resources which is very helpful.
5,The Military Advantage : A Comprehensive Guide to Your Military & Veterans Benefits,"very pleased with the information in this book, very helpful in looking for veterans benefits."
4,Great for Active Duty - Not So Much For Veterans,"This book has a wealth of information for those on active duty, but it lacks much useful information for Veterans. I wouldn't recommend it for a Veteran."
2,Not enough practice questions.,"I purchased this book at our local bookstore, and I did ask for the answer key and received it.I was trying to use this book to teach my son Algebra. Examples on how to solve are given for each type of problems, but this book does not have enough practice questions. On average it has about 3 to 6 problems for different type of problems. For teaching someone who has never taken algebra, the best method to learn, imho, is to work many problems as possible. But having 3 to 6 questions, isn't enough to drill in the techniques for young students. This book might work for people who only needs a refresher. Other problem I felt with this book is that it did not address much in the basics, such as x square + x cube type problems. (X^2 + X^3 = X^5)Previously, I taught my daughter with Key to Algebra series. It worked out really well for her. I'm going back to Key to Algebra series for basics and more problems.Good examples, but not enough problems to solve. 2 stars."
1,motorola home monitoring,The unit has two cameras that capture images and transfer the images to computer.It is supposed to have remote viewing capability but the code given with the unit is not valid. I contacted Amazon and Motorola. Motorola did not reply to my e-mail. When I called them they were not helful. I will not recommend this unit.
1,Complete Garbage,"Do NOT waste your money on this trash!!! Words cannot even begin to describe my frustration with this product, and with Motorola's technical support for this either. I've installed multi-thousand dollar security systems with no real problems before, but this cheap piece of trash is nothing other than that - trash."
4,Mine worked fine for years!,"Everyone is trashing this product, but mine worked fine (with three cameras) for four years. Evidently the controller gave out over the last couple of months as I discovered today when I was starting the software to monitor an upcoming UPS delivery. I'm ordering another. I wish the text message it sends were shorter (comes as two instead of one), but aside from that I'm quite satisfied with this product. I've watched deliveries from hundreds of miles away.Motorola clearly offers no technical support on their website, which is disturbing, so if this new system doesn't work, it will be returned to amazon, and I'll change my review."
1,AN OLD PRODUCT!!!!,"Buyers,Do not buy this old out-dated product! I'm a fan of Motorolar Products...Cell Phones, bluetooth headset, 2 way-radio...but not this!!!...no new product support in their website at all....Old one only!!!!...Oh, boy!!!...Good luck who ever wants to buy this product!"
3,Funny quotes but too easy,"Full of cute quotes but if you've worked cryptoquotes for awhile, this book will be too easy for you. Great for beginners."
4,second book i ordered for my husband for xmas,"this was the second book i ordered for my husband (who is a"" stink"" to buy for,) he doesn't like anything digital,so finding game books for him can be a real chore, thank goodness there is a good selection on amazon.con; would have been happy to give it a 5 star but same problem as before it takes a little too long to get it delivered"
1,Does anyone have an aspirin?,"I just finished the first puzzle, and man did that ever give me a wicked headache. The font is so not user-friendly. Can I get my money back?The best cryto-puzzles are the Cryptoclassics from the RBMA Mall. I'm going to stick with them from now on."
3,OK,"This product was probably awesome back in the day, but I guess I bought it too late. Too much outdated stuff."
4,Some excellent ideas and techniques,"Well let me say first why I didn't give this book 5 stars: Too little written on CF compnents and too much on WDDX. I realise that the book was written several years ago, but it definitely needs a revision.Now, let me tell you why I didn't give it 3 stars: As a ColdFusion programmer for a number of years, there's very little written in book form for advanced CF programmers. So I do recommend this book if you are, like me, a programmer that came from another field into programming through ColdFusion and want something that gets into a little more than just connecting to a database and spitting out some data. However, if you have a programming background in other languages you may find this book to be a little boring."
5,Beautifully Done,"In 1774, amidst all the hate and anger on both the Patriot and Tory sides of the war, Prudence Emerson's family stands strong. Their beliefs keep them true to the Crown-and also puts them in a state of grave danger.Pru confides in her diary about all the hate and anger directed toward her family and familes like hers, simply for their beliefs.In most Revolutionary War books, the main topic or character in a Patriot or around Patriot beliefs. It's new and refreshing to hear the opinions from the other side of the story."
4,Pretty good book,"This book was overall very good. I enjoyed it because I found the American Revolution interesting the way it shaped our country and nation. I especially liked it because Prudence is my age, 13 or 14 years old and is the 2nd-oldest. I liked it because she had to take care of her younger siblings, as I do (I have 1 younger sister and a dog). What I did not understand was that they did not really mention what day it began and what exactly happened. But outside that, it was a good book and I enjoyed it."
2,Not so good,"Although this sounded like a really original book, being a Tory's diary and all, wen I read it, a lot of it was just story telling. It didn't have many historical eventsi n it, just every day life. There were a lot of stories of family and friends, but it never really developed a real plot. However, the characters were all developed brilliantly, and it did give me a good sese of what life at home would have been like."
2,My Love Thy Neighbor Review,This book was not great. It was not bad. But it was more towards the bad side than the good side. But I would not say it was so bad. But I've read much better books. Especially in the Dear America series. I reccommend-do not read this book it was not good.
3,Good product; picky dog,"I bought a 6 foot ramp to make it easier on my old hound to get up anddown the 4 stairs to enter the house. It was very well made. He absolutelyrefused to use it though, even with all kinds of treat-bribing. It may have been that he didn't like the feel of the grit surface (good for traction),I don't know.For other pet owners with less fussy critters, it would be an excellentinvestment. Folds in half easily and has a built-in carry handle."
3,not exactly what i expected,"not exactly what i expected. More stories/legends of ill-fated romances, etc and less of the hunting/fishing/exploring stories i like more. All in all though, an interesting book worth buying but only if you love Penna. history."
5,"Excellent tools for parents and children, regardless of age","I purchased these Mercer Mayer books for out youngest son Darius, as teaching tools for ""life"" concepts. Of late, I've been giving them to my adult children as teaching tools for LIFE concepts, they cross the generational gap easily. My older boy, Ben (twenty-eight) was initially aggravated, but he read it, smiled. We talked, he assured me that he now ""get's it"". I would highly recommend these for any parent."
3,guitar world: Mastering Fretboard Harmony,My DVD arrived today and I sat through the disc for an overall view of the material.What was difficult for me was the instructors fast start/stop speech pattern. I can see that the information is there and I will sift through it as best I can but I already know that listening to the instructor is going to drive me crazy. I'm sure he knows his theory but not everyone is set up emotionally to teach. Three stars for content.
4,"Good, but not great","The information presented in the video is helpful, and the instructor gives some good techniques to learn theory on guitar.The overall production value is not high quality. The instructor refers to examples, but they must be printed out from the DVD's folder. Other videos I thought were better were able to put diagrams, charts, examples, etc. right on the screen as you are playing along and watching. So unless you have the materials printed out beforehand, it can be hard to follow.One other detail, which may seem trivial, but I believe makes a difference is that the instructor has a lisp. It's already difficult subject material, which is not aided by listening to an explanation by an instructor with a lisp for a couple of hours."
1,An expensive disappointment,I bought this phone to replace an aging motorola. The phone worked fine for 30 days or so then started to need re-charging more frequently. As of today I've had it for two and a half months and it needs to be re-charged every night. Nokia will let me send it in so they can look at it but their policy is no loaner which means I have to buy another phone anyway. My conversation with Nokia's repair service ended with a conviction that I will never own another Nokia product. Admittedly this is partially due to the unanswered emails I sent prior to calling them.
3,no USB connection,"great phone and would have given it 5 stars if it had a USB connection, which it doesn't."
1,Rubbish,"This is the worst cell phone I have ever owned. The call clarity is horrible, the instrument panel itself is clumsy design, the software has a lag and according to a T-Mobile insider it won't last for a year let alone the 2-year contract that T-Mobile made me sign-up for this phone.This was my first phone from Nokia (I was always happy with Motorola) and it was a dissapointment. But I went ahead and got a 6133 after two faulty 6103's. The 6133 is a good phone ... does everything it says it will and it does it well too!"
3,"cute to look at, but hard to put together!!!","I have just received my atlantic 1316, and boy was it hard to get those screws to go into the bottom of it,it was like the screws were to small. I practically broke my thumb trying to get them to fit. But now that is all together it seems really steady and i was able to fit all my cd's in there even my double wide cd cases and it fits into the corner nicely...."
5,Great Product!!!,"I could not be happier with my new CD storage case. It arrived fast, in mint condition, and was so easy to put together it only took a couple of minutes. I like the classy design and be black and cherry wood finish blended well with the decor in my home. I just love having easy access to all my favorite music. Even my friends comment how much they like it so I tell them go to Amazon.com and order one."
2,"The CDs are in it, but...","It is true what the other reviews said, the cherry balls are not drilled properly to fit on the top, you can't even force them, they need to be redrilled. And the ""screws"" for the bottom, well, I had to hammer them into place. I didn't have any problem fitting the cds in place, though."
2,Very nice,"They are nice to keep things organized. Not a big deal, but collects dust so you have to keep up with it. I dont."
3,Tower,"I like the tower, but, the holes in the decorative balls are too small so they could not be placed on top of the tower."
1,Never Received,"I am still waiting for this article. I've emailed the guyssupposedly sending this twice. He said he would look into it, but nothing has happened. What do I do next/Jim Malone"
1,The color is BLACK???!!!!,"It looks nice on the picture that as a Red one, but when it gets my home, it is black... I buy it mostly for the color and am very very disappointed to see the color...."
4,This CD Storage Case gets the job done ;for the most part,"The whole purpuse of investing in a CD rack is to be able to store your CD's in a relatively condensed manor, while at the same time helping to preserve the condition of the outer jewel cases. In that regard, it holds its own masterfully. The price is also very reasonable considering the total capacity of cd's that can be stored.Just be forwarned that this storage rack (along with many others)is not intended to hold a large quantity of ""double sized jewel cases"" (commen with many Playstation one and 4 disk Japanese/ foregin 4 disk sets). IT IS INTENDED FOR SINGLE JEWEL CASES. it can only hold about 3 or 4 ""double sized jewel cases"".Overall, a great value, just keep in mind the above inperfection."
2,bad,"constips extremely easy on carpet and if you have a lot of cds stacked at the toppoorly designed, it is a vertical cd rack that doesnt have individual slots for cds, so if you want a cd from the bottom of a stack you have basically pull the whole stack to get to itputting it together was a pain, the one i bought i had to break a piece of metal just to fit it in its guide holes.again..poorly designed... doesnt even fit cds that well, there are gaps, and the cd casses are loose fittingpros..........i guess it can hold a lot of cds...."
4,Use your imagination and the price can't be beat,This product is a great deal. The problem with its shakiness can be easily solved with a little imagination. Get two standard sized bricks and place them at the bottom of each of the two metal spires (they fit perfectly). Friends will compliment you on your post-modern taste and sense of design as well! They will use up about 10 CD's worth of space but then you still have storage for about 100 standard cd-cases or 200 thin ones.
1,Save your money!,"It's a nice look, but it tips over very easily. It is not steady on a rug surface dispite what the picture on the box shows. My advice is if you need a CD rack that holds a lot of CD's? Save your money and invest in something nicer and more sturdy."
2,Tips on carpet,"I've owned this CD rack for almost an entire decade. It holds up well through moves, and it did it's job in holding CDs. Unfortunately, there are too many problems with this CD rack to justify any price point above $15:1) It stands well on bare floors or very short carpet, but if you have medium carpets, this thing will tip over as soon as you touch it.2) If you attempt to move it, it's very easy for the metal portion to become detached from the base plate. You have to either slide it across the floor using your foot to ""kick-slide"" it, or waddle it to your new location. Or you can take it off the base plate and move it separately.3) Since there are sections that hold several CDs, if you attempt to take the bottom CD out of a section, you have to hold the rest of the CDs in place, as they'll also fall out due to gravity/friction. If you have this CD rack sitting on medium-thick carpet, this also causes the entire rack to tip over."
3,Not as easy as it looks,"Received the tower yesterday. The feet you have to screw into the bottom of the tower are very hard to get in. Also I had to drill the holes in the balls that go on top of the tower because the holes were to small to fit on the tower. I like it now that it is put together, but it was frustrating."
4,bravely it waves,"I think this is quite a nice CD holder. I've had no problems with it whatsoever, in fact, this is my second one and they look great doing the ""bookend"" thing. Holds tons of CD and lets you organize them nicely. Whoever said it was hard to put together got a ""are you kidding?"" look from my 14 year old who put it together in about 5 minutes. I'm a satisfied customer here."
5,GREAT ITEM for the VALUE,"Got the item at a better price than the one I had bought at the store.Received it, quicker than expected"
4,CD Storage,"Atlantic 1316 CD Storage Case (110-Capacity, Wave)I love the design of this piece, and we're happy with it.My only complaint relates to the assembly. Other reviews had complained about attaching the decorative balls on top. We had no problem with that, but the screws on the bottom were really hard to put in. We had to hammer them in to get them to fit."
3,not worth the money,"I was very disappointed in the construction quality of the product. Three of the 4 small balls at the top of the tower were drilled too small to fit on the metal shaft, so therefore, I had to drill the holes larger. It wasn't worth the expense and time to return the product."
1,Don't waste your time!,"This nice looking CD Tower took almost two hours to assemble because NOTHING fit. The plastic screws had to be widened, and Im going to have to drill larger holes in the little wooden balls to get them to cap off the tower. The product is advertised as ""Free from defects..."". I wish that were true. Now I know why the product is inexpensive - it's because it's cheap."
1,cd tower,this item is a waste of money it doesnt stand well on carpet it tips easy and down comes the cds to put back again. assembly (the parts didnt all fit together as notes stand tip was striped).
2,Looks cool but hard to use,The online image correctly shows that this is an attractive CD rack. It is very hard to use in a practical way though as the discs slip between the uprights and are so tenuous on the shelves that I don't want to risk pulling them out to play. I'm glad I didn't get two.
4,Easy assembly EXCEPT...,"... the wooden balls that are to be placed on top were drilled out at too small of a circumference to fit on the metal frame. I had to spent about 20 minutes with a pocket knife whittling out the holes so they would fit. Even still, total assembly time was about 35 minutes and the end result is a stable and attractive CD tower. As other reviewers mentioned, you will have to take out the entire stack to access your CD. That's fine for me -- I digitally store all of my media and really only keep the physical copy for archival and aesthetic purposes."
5,Another Carpenter Classic..,"John Carpenter does most of the music for most of his movies. And as in his other films, such as Halloween, Prince of Darkness, etc, once again he shows his entunement with what is being shown to the audience, and the mood they feel with the sound of the movie score.The Fog's eerie sound gives you the sense of isolation that Carpenter must have wanted the audience to feel, along with impending disaster. A definite "" Must "" for people who either want to draw on the sound for creative purposes, or for the next Halloween party."
5,CREEPY MUSIC!!,"John Carpenter does a great job with the music for this film. It fits the movie so well. I had to find a soundtrack for the movie after I saw it!!Anyway, if you like the music from Halloween, then check this cd out. It is just as good- only different.The Fog and it's music are both fantastic!!!This CD would be a great centerpiece for a halloween party and definetely a great addition to a CD collection!!!!"
4,CHILLING,This selection is not for your begining listener. You must realy have an appreciation for music to fully grasp the fulness of this cd. Carpenter has a unique ear for music and this selection is among his top musical scores.
1,Bad choice ro just unlucky?,"I ordered 2 of these pads from Amazon. I figured a stamp pad was just a stamp pad so I went with the cheapest choice. Neither of the pads I received had enough ink to produce even one good solid stamp. They seemed dried out, and through lots of dabbing and smearing I did manage to get enough ink on the pad for one half-hearted looking stamp. Both pads had similar results and went into the trash before I even got back up out of my seat. I'm not sure if the problem was that they may have been old, or may not have had a good seal before being shrink wrapped, but these stamp pads were a total disappointment."
2,"Not a ""training"" video, but some useful info if you are just starting in dogs","Wow; I sure was expecting better than this! I mean no disrespect to the late Mr Fisher; actually, that is not a put down to him since HE did not produce this tape. It was made after his death, and one would think that someone who he'd mentored could have actually SHOWED the ""John Fisher Method"" so often referred to. But, alas, no one does. There is some good information on general dog behavior, choosing a breed, etc. So if you're just getting into dogs or considering getting a dog, it is definitely worthwhile. But if you are looking for a practical Dog Training video, one to show you how to teach your dog, this is not it."
2,Not that great,"I was disappointed with this DVD. I didn't like it at all, poor methods of dog training, nothing I didn't already know."
3,I guess Elvis didn't really like singing Christmas songs,"Although you'd think Elvis would have relished putting his own spin on classic Christmas songs, most of his versions are pretty generic and forgetable.WINTER WONDERLAND gets my vote for weirdest Elvis version of a traditional song. For most of the song, both Elvis's singing and the musical arrangement is mediocre - but the ending is amazing. Although it was recorded in 1971, Elvis ends this song in classic 1950's-era Elvis style - with a HOUND DOG strip-tease-esque ending. Go, Elvis!If you already have the songs elsewhere, the only reason to buy the new collection is to have them all one cd."
3,GOOD BUT LEAVES MORE TO BE DESIRED,"The CD is a good collection of some real good christmas carols. In my quest to find some real good authentic christmas carols, found this to come close but not enough to satisfy your heart. Bing Crosby and Sinatra still stand out as the more appealing ones. The QUEST goes on...."
5,What an inspiring young man!,"I throughly enjoyed this book. I gave copies to several friends who also enjoyed it. Through his letters home, it is obvious that Morris Redmann was an exceptional young man. I felt that I got to know him through these letters. Beautifully put together."
3,Silver decent but the 18/0 shows,I bought the silverware but should have paid more attention to the 18/0 quality. If you have ever owned 18/10 silverware then you know the weight of the silverware.The pieces are light but seem ok. I bought the set at $[...] so at that price it was a good value. A good way to watch prices would be to use [...] to watch the prices changes.
5,Best Value,"This is the best value set I have come accross, the chips peel a little at first but they are fantastic.The cards that came in the set are better used as firewood."
4,fair compilation,"This is a mixed emotion album. Five songs off this hits package was never really released until this album came out. The sound quality sounds low so you will have to turn up the volume to get the full effect. The Zombies are a great band. They were in the industry for three years, and had three top ten hits. Two of those three went to #1. I would recommend you get, Odeesy & Oracle and Singles A & B's to get the full effect of The Zombies magical music!"
2,Badly needs digital remastering,"The Zombies had three great hits in three years: ""She's Not There"", ""You Make Me Feel So Good"" and ""Time of the Season"". I don't know where the rest of this music came from -- I have heard a few of the songs a few times, but most were certainly not ""hits"" by any definition of the word.The recording quality is very poor -- it sounds worse than my old LPs. I strongly suggest another compilation if you are a big Zombies fan. This one is not worth the few dollars it costs."
1,not premiun,Rubber on the bottom might as well not even be there it is worthless I threw mine in the garbage. Ill say it again its worthless unless you glew it down. You get what you pay for.
1,"Certainly not ""Premium"" - more like ""Garbage""","There's foam on the underside, not rubber, allowing the pad to slide too easily. The tracking surface of the pad is too slippery and smooth for mechanical (ball) mice and not patterned enough for some optical mice. If the mechanical mouse's tracking ball gets even slightly dirty/dusty, it won't track properly."
2,Low quality,"The mousepad is super thin! After a few months, it no longer laid flat and has a crinkled look to it."
5,good for optical mice,"This mousepad has a plasticky surface and the mouse glides smoothly and accurately. Definitely recommend. For the price, this one can't be beat. I also tried the 3m mousepad which costs more but performs the same as this one."
4,Somewhat uncomfortable,"This is an attractive mousepad, and my optical mouse tracks well on it. The one drawback is that the edges of the plastic surface are pretty sharp and uncomfortable for my wrist, so I use it bent over the edge of the desk."
2,You get what you pay for,"Yes, I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a fancy mouse pad. However, in this case, I got what I paid for. This mouse pad is thin, absolutely not non-skid, and is very noisy (scratchy sounding) when the mouse rolls over it. Because of the meagre price, it is not worth bothering with a return. However, if I had it to do over again, I wouldn't !! (and I'll be looking for a better quality product)"
1,Not even worth $2,"I read some reviews saying this mousepad wasn't the nicest in the world, but for $2 it does the trick. However... I use a laser mouse (a Razer Banshee) and it doesn't even work at all on the mouse pad. The surface is a hard, plastic-like texture that is absolutely HORRIBLE for mouses. I may as well just use the mouse on my desk - at least it works on that surface."
4,Excellent for the price,"If you like slick-surface mousepads, this is an excellent choice.PROS:- Super Cheap- Reasonably large- Slick surface allows for easy mouse movement- No patterns to confuse the optical sensorCONS:- Thin- The bottom surface doesn't grip my desk as much as I would like, but it's not a big deal - it won't be sliding around much under normal use."
4,Holy Goodness,"This is a mousepad. It is a pad under my mouse. But really, it is so much more than that. Not only does it cradle my mouse in a loving manner, it allows my purchases to reach over the $25 threshold. What more could I ask for?-1 star for not being red, apparently that costs over a dollar extra. Shameful"
4,Good mouse pad!,Good mouse pad. Mouse glides easily. Was bent when it arrived but has finally straightened out. I don't really like the thin plastic top but it works fine.
4,Great for the dollar.,"Sure there are better mouse pads out there, but this one more than gets the job done. You can't beat the price."
1,Atrocious!,"This DVD is a total waste of money. The background music will drive you crazy -- and obscure the interviews -- and the woman doing voice-over sounds as if she failed remedial reading. She says ""transcendent"" for transcendental meditation, and believes that the musician Jeff Lynne is Jeff Line. This is just a money-grabbing exercise with a hodge-podge of old British TV footage, three-quarters of which doesn't show George at all. No wonder it says ""unauthorized"" on the cover. Olivia must be losing her mind over exploitational material like this! PS. The system makes me give it a star -- it isn't worthy of one!"
2,Incongruous,"There are a few interesting segments of this DVD. The material comes from British sources. So there is some footage I have not seen before. BUT, the producers have added a guitar based backing track that is irritating beyond belief."
1,Don't buy it!!!!,"Awful!!!It is a shame that it is available at all ....it is not worth a dime...It focuses on a very narrow aspect of Georges life.Poor image,poor contents.Don't buy it!!!"
1,Disappointment,"I was given this DVD and I was VERY disappointed after watching it! There was NOTHING new, the narration was inaccurate, and it showed stock footage from other sources that I've already seen several times before."
3,Another Beatle Documentry?,"George was a great Beatle. George was the most talented MUSICIAN of The Beatles. Most of this is composed of other documentry's material of the ""Fab Four"". If you NEED this, you will also need, ""The Concert For George"". A very compelling concert performed at Royal Albert Hall one year to the day that he passed on to the ages. Everyone who performs are George's friends performing George's music. The headliners are many but Eric Clapton organized a proper tribute to his friend, by his friends and his son Dhani. Also included are George's favorite comedy act...Monte Python. The beginning of the show is the Eastern music that George loved and worshipped followed by most of every song you've heard George sing.I could only give three stars to the documentry because it is repetative of other documentries while ""The Concert For George"" is a solid five for production, content and talent."
1,You've got to be joking,"I found it impossible to take this book seriously. The reasoning is off the wall, lines of thought are often impossible to follow, and he basically just ends up in a big mess. I have seen Barre tout these ideas before, and he offers no backing for his outrageous ideas, he just says in effect, ""That's the way it is because I say so."" His argumentative tone and personal attacks on anybody who disagrees with him have gotten him kicked off no less than 7 Internet email lists, by his own count, and this book continues that dubious tradition.The book is supposed to be a series of ""essays,"" but several of these ""essays"" are one sentence long. That's an essay? The blurb calls him a Bible scholar, but this book has as much in common with scholarship as a duck has with a bicycle. Don't waste your time or your money on this one. I tend to believe that the reason it's self-published is because no truly scholarly publisher would touch it with an eleven-foot pole."
2,"House, not Hip Hop","This is definitely not hip hop, but tribal house with lots offunky vocals... too funky and cheesy for my taste."
1,Not So Mighty Hercules -- with an explanation,"This CD is welcome for fanatics of early 60's kiddie ersatz, but apart from the art work and some track titles has very little to offer that fans of the Mighty Hercules cartoon show from Trans-Lux will remember. Those seeking some of the lushly orchestrated music used as underscoring should look to an out-of-print Intrada CD called Creature From The Black Lagoon, devoted to the music of Hans J. Salter. The horn-laden music underscoring the scenes in which Hercules put on his magic ring and held it up to the lightning, and the heroics that followed, were all lifted from the score of the 1955 movie The Black Shield of Falworth, co-written by Salter, a suite from which -- including the ""Hercules"" music -- is included on the ""Creature From The Black Lagoon"" CD from Intrada."
1,Wished I'd listened to the clips first,"Can only blame myself. The audio clips and buyer reviews were all there but I leaped first. ""Cast Recording""? Noooo way. This is some group re-singing the songs from the original show, but completely void of the familiar, if hokey and shrill, voices and sound effects of the cartoon. The artwork that shipped with this (seems I had to supply my own CD case) seems genuine enough. I recall that Golden Records did a lot of these cheap, brightly coloured plastic 45 RPM ""homages"" to TV shows back in the early 60's. I recall it because the feeling of disappointment when I played this CD was completely familiar. LISTEN TO THE AUDIO CLIPS *FIRST* and decide. It will help you avoid trying to summon the mighty Hercules to dispatch the goons who put this together. O-lympiaaaaaahhhh!"
4,Lighten Up!,"Review of the REO side---I understand people who never took a liking to REO's music, but...I have to say that this album has more melody and soul than anything else I've heard from the band. Could it be that Kevin's leadership and creative talent has taken the band away from just making noise to really making music that they want people to hear? Hitt's percussion is great! Much more lively than the band had in the past. Amato's riffs are different, but very enjoyable. A great treat for the serious REO fan."
1,Why?,"Why would STYX release another live album 3 years after The Return to Paradise? I mean come on, it doesn't even have Dennis DeYoung on lead vocals. The good thing is that JY is still there after all these years.But yet they don't even do Miss America. This is not the STYX you grew up with, but if you take a listen you'll throw up with."
4,Styx and REO's joint effort is a classic rock dream.,"First I thought I would correct the track listing. Styx: Blue Collar Man, Grand Illusion, Fooling Yourself, Lady, Brave New World, Edge Of The Century, Heavy Water, To Much Time, Renegade, Blue Collar Man(W/REO), Roll With The Changes(w/REO)Reo Speedwagon: Don't Let Him Go, Music Man, Take It On The Run, Can't Fight This Feeling, Time For Me TO Fly, Back On The Road Again, Keep On Loving You, Roll With The Changes, Ridin' The Storm Out, 157 Riverside Avenue, Blue Collar Man(w/Styx), Roll With The Changes(w/Styx)If you Like Styx and Reo Speedwagon you will love this double cd set. The sound is great and well mixed, two classic bands bringing out the best in each other."
5,Rockin' The Arch,WOW two of my favorite bands playing together in one place. Styx and REO Speedwagon struck gold when they decided to cut this CD. I think that Styx and Foreigner should do the same. Anyway these are 2 of the best bands of all-time they are both in my Top Ten. I especially appreciate the Blue Collar Man (Long Nights) Collaberation with both bands. I thought that that was a particular nice touch. The only thing that could make it better is if Dennis DeYoung was there. Yes I know Lawrence Gowan is the new keyboardist and that Dennis DeYoung had to bow out due to Chronis Fatigue Syndrome and all things considered Lawrence Gowan does due a good job. But still Styx just isn't Styx without Dennis DeYoung there.
1,Reo/Sticks,"First I have been a fan of both bands for a very long time.Reo-Why ??? Kevins voice is gone on this album and the Guitar player still has not learned the parts to most of these songs and it's been 15 years !!!!""Nobody plays guitar like gary does"" Sticks-Without dennis there is no styx only sticks!!! Gowen is not bad but you cant replace dennis !!! FrankenYoung and Shawenstein should move on and stop using the name.This album was a total waste of plastic and should be recycled at once !!!"
4,Live and Lovin' It,"This CD proves that classic rock bands still have what it takes to give a great concert. I love the music of Styx and think it's great that this isn't just a ""Greatest Hits Live"" CD, as it has the classics, as well as some new fan favorites. REO's CD is also very good, and I find myself liking this excellent band more and more each time I hear it. The only thing that keeps it from getting a perfect score, in my opinion, is the fact that the true mood of a rock concert will never be fully realized on a CD."
1,Not one worthless band but two,"I thought todays music was bad, with the likes of Brittney Spears, Christina Aguilera and such, now we get bombarded with the worst of the 80's. What's going on. Styx once again flaunts their overtly pretentious, overly produced, and in one word which sums it up Bad music. Why don't these ""has beens"" just go away. As for REO what can you say about them now that you couldn't 18 years ago. They were bad then and their even worse now. It's embarassing to see Kevin Cronin as a 50 year old up there on stage in his spandex pants belting out fluffy little tunes in his high helium filled voice. These 2 bands together make me think that I'm watching Spinal Tap again. The only difference is Spinal Tap's music is better."
2,Arch Allies,"Well, I never thought I would say this but this is one Styx CD I could do without. To even try to replace Dennis Deyoung is a joke. Gowan tried, but did not succeed in duplicating the magic Dennis brought to the band. His version of the Grand Illusion was laughable. If Styx wants to move on without Dennis, change the name and leave his songs at home. If you want a rockin' Styx live album, choose Caught in the act or Return to Paradise. That's the way Styx should sound. How sad to watch a great band make fools of themselves. As far as the REO Cd is concerned, I think REO did a great job. Kevin Cronin's voice is a bit weak, but he did everything right. If you like REO, get it....if it's STYX you're after, forget it!"
2,Yuck,"As a general rule, I personally, don't like live recordings. There are a few that have made their way into my collection, and there they shall remain. This one, however, is one I did not care for at all. Too many songs are repeated, both Styx and REO. While both bands are fabulous, I don't want or need to hear Blue Collar Man done more than once."
2,:|,"I just received Dermablend Setting Powder, but it is not the product from Vichy, on the bottom is written Dermablend L'Oreal USA, so it's not the real deal."
1,Dermablend??,"After discovering dermablend at the mall with my sister I knew it was the makeup for me. I loved it, I even got the setting powder in warm saffron to help the makeup last longer. However after trying it several times I realized I wanted to try the sheer setting powder and ordered it here. I am not convinced that this is the original dermablend product. Maybe I am wrong but I think this particular product is a knock off. I will try ordering the product from another seller and make sure the label says Dermablend professional."
1,Doesn't work for me,"I have been using derma blend since 2003. I bought the setting powder but it never works. When I apply my concealer, I dab on a generous amount of setting powder and leave it on for 5-10 minutes before I dust it off but the concelaer still remains moist/wet and rubs off if I touch it or brush up against clothing etc. Perhaps I got a bad batch but it makes absolutely no difference to me."
3,"Applicator, Please!","I like the powder as it is effective, but I wish it included a more practical applicator. I also wish Dermablend would provide samples of their color powders and their foundations."
2,Cakey and Gross,"This item was fine when it came to pictures; tattoos were not visible on film for the first part of our wedding. However I was told by a few of the guests that it looked like I had been in a fight before the wedding... make-up should not look like bruises!The make-up also started to fade not long after the ceremony ended, and it was a short ceremony. By the end of the reception (four hours later) you could clearly see the tattoos.Also, I was told that the make-up would not rub off onto clothing if I used the special setting powder together with the cream... Not true. I now have make-up stains on one of my brides maids dresses.I realize now that I should have just let the tattoos show. Why have a tattoo if you're not willing to show it off?"
2,samples included but not,Free samples were indicated on the receipt stating 3 items included in the box but only received the 1 product I ordered.Shipping people must have taken the samples.That's all I can say.
4,the continuing saga,"Anders releases yet another in their seemingly frantic explosion of album releases. Blood Lush is undoubtedly Classic Anders Manga with a definate, noticable musical growth. Anders fans should enjoy this album and newbies to the group would get a good feel for what Anders is all about!"
4,Great book,"Really enjoy this book, cause I'm adult returning to piano lessons and rediscovering some old skills. Love the ""psychology of learning"" and the looking backward to see why it never worked before. I gave a copy to my mother-in-law (who's a beginning adult pianist at age 70+, and she loves it too- she's taking notes."
5,"""Juicy Mistakes""","I found Westney's book amazingly confirming. His concept of ""juicy mistakes"" is a brilliant suggestion to accept that you'll make mistakes -- go ahead and make them!...but learn all there is to learn from them! (advice for life, not just music) This is a book for your senses and your brain -- a must read for any music lover."
4,Quack and Count Review,"I had bought the book for a 2nd grade lesson, but it is too basic for 2nd graders. The book has a great concept for teaching using different addends to get the same number, but definitely for K-1."
4,"Impressive Photos, Unimpressive software bundle",While its obvious that this camera takes outstanding quality shots I would like to focus on 2 disappointments:1. The MGI PhotoSuite 8.1 software is not a suite at all. More like a 1991 watered down MS paint... On top of that the MGI VideoWave III SE software isn't even compatible with Windows XP. There was a long list of compatibility problems on ... Save me the $... they charge for this junk.2. The 16MB Memory stick is an insult. ... Is this how you got the camera under ...? I had to dish out another $... to get a 128MB stick. I would have rather not had the 16MB stick included and paid $... less.I understand the whole marketing point of accessories but when you're buying a $... camera the above listed items are absolutely unacceptable. The price should be more around $... and leave out the software and stick.Other than that the camera is excellent!
4,Sony F505 and F707 Cybershot Digital Camera,I have had the Sony F505 for a year now. I know of no camera that can match the quality of the photos it takes. It uses a 3.2 megapixel array but only employs a maximum of 2.7 of the available megapixels. I believe the quality of the photos is due to the Zeiss lens and to a superior A-to-D conversion process. My only gripe with the camera is its lack of a viewfinder (only needed for bright sunlight). This apparently has been corrected in the new F707 model. The 5 megapixels that the F707 sports is almost overkill. The F505 will be my last camera (until the infrared camera that can see through clothing hits the market).
5,Best Price & Best Camera,I looked at every digital camera imaginable. The Minolta Dimage 7 costs more and burns batteries like wildfire. The Nikon Coolpix 5000 costs more and doesn't have a good zoom and has several glitches and bugs. This camera has everything at a lower price and also takes pictures that are as good or better than all the other similar cameras. It also has the battery and adapter included! The only thing missing is the use of cds to store the images on like the other Sony's have. You'd think that would've been included since this one takes larger photos...but this is still an unbeatable camera. It takes photos in quality comparable to the top of the line Nikon digital cameras (the professional models). You can't go wrong with this camera.
5,A must have,"Even though the camera has been out for a couple of years, don't let that make you think it's out of date. This camera is such a breeze to use that it is a joy to take pictures with. Having a pivot joint allows you to take pictures that you would have to lay on the ground for otherwise. The time between pressing the button and the picture being taken is much faster than my old Sony digital camera. All the buttons are well placed, extremely good ergonomics. This was a $1200 camera when it first came out for good reason. It is a must have for anyone looking to take quality pictures and do it with ease."
3,camera damage due to heavy telephoto lens....,"First of all, I've owned this camera for approx. 4 yrs and have had some success in producing quality pictures. However, within the last year, I purchased the only telephoto lens made for the camera which is quite heavy to say the least. I believe, because of the weight, the lens has caused damage to the camera... partially separating the manual focus cylinder from the body of the camera.I've discussed with Sony and got little satisfaction. All they will do is refer me to a contracted vendor to repair it at substantial cost since I did not have an extended warranty.HAS ANYONE ELSE EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEM, AND IF SO, CAN THEY SHARE WHETHER OR NOT IT EVER GOT RESOLVED?ALSO, MY ACTION SHOTS USUALLY RESULT IN BLURRED IMAGINES. WHAT CAN BE DONE TO CORRECT THIS ISSUE?Thanks,Roger"
5,Sony DSC-F707,I owned the Sony DSC-S50 for about 2 years.. loved it.. I bought this one around Christmas and I LOVE it! Once you get into printing your own pictures this is a must! The difference in resolution is Wonderful! These pictures come out sooo much better than the 2.1mp ones. I love all the features and the ability to hook up wide angle and close-up lenses is great! If you're looking for a great camera that is easy to use.. grab this one!
4,"Not expected, but still great.","On this album, Mnau Chao takes things down a notch, creating beautiful music albeit lighter and slower.It took a few listens to get into the rhythms and the flow but once I did, I found myself hooked on such catchy tunes like 'J'ai Besoin De La Lune' and 'Il Faut Manger.'Despite the album being all in French, Manu Chao succeeds again in making great music that transcends languages."
3,Not as expected,"A normal collection of songs in Manu Chao's style, but not so different from what I expected. Surely it is an interesting work."
4,3/8 rachet,This rachet is strong and it works great. I use it about 3-4 time a week and I've never had problem with. It's a great investment.
2,Use only for home use,"As a professional auto technician I find the cheapest tools don't always last. I've bought 3 sets of CH air ratchets which lasts almost a year. Three years ago I bought a much more expensive Snap On brand and it's still working. If you plan on using CH stuff for the occasional home use then it's worth the short term for the money. If you plan on using it 6 days a week for professional applications then I'd frown on it and recommend a better and usually more expensive brand (Snap On, Cornwell, Mac, Ingersoll-Rand, and Matco)."
5,Must have Christmas collection.,This is a must have Christmas collection for Elvis fans and Christmas music. All of the most loved Christmas songs are in this CD.
5,Raghav is genius,"His lyrics are byfar one of the best I've heard. The beats in the songs are awesome, and you won't be able to get them out of your head. Although the entire cd is one song, it is a must buy."
5,One of the Best Compilations of the Year,"The influential label Giant Steps digs deep and compiles slammin' jams that have passed radio's radar screen on the lush ""Soul Sessions."" While modern r&b collections grow repulsively trendy, this album offers slammin soulful grooves from names that may be familiar to the average Joe Schmo as well as other tracks from lesser-known artists. Standouts include the mellowed out jazz of Ultra Nate in ""Twisted,"" as well as Jody Watley's ""Saturday Night Experience,"" a welcome diversion from her dance pop of the 1980s. My favorite track is the funkified ""Our New National Anthem"" by Donnie. All in all, this is a groovilicious collection that should appeal to soul snobs and casual listeners alike."
2,A disappointed follow up to the Dilbert Principle/Future,"I am an ardent Dilbert fan, however I found this book full of cartoons that I had already seen and the writing was not as witty and incisive as the earlier books. I just didn't find myself thinking 'this is really true or this is really funny' as before.Since Scott Adams has been at home relying on Email from others for inspiration, his originality and insights into office life are very much less than before. He needs to explore new angles (like International differences) to keep his material fresh."
3,"There's Some Good Stuff, But a Lot of Fluff","Scott Adams fourth Dilbert hardback book is not his best (the Dilbert Principle wins that one hands down). There are some very funny stories in the book, I was really howling at times. But there are times his humor misses the mark, such as his answer to Norman Solomon's anti-Dilbert book, which I thought came off as mean-spirited. Unfortunately, there are more misses than hits in this book.Scott Adams has brought joy in the workplace over the past five years with his dead-on humor about the corporate business world. It has also brought him many financial opportunities, of which he has taken advantage. I say more power to him, I'd do the same. But I'm starting to wonder whether he should stop writing these full-length books and instead create some more comic books with strips that are outside of those that are published in papers. He's done this before and I think that is where he can entertain more people in the future."
4,Dot-com boom book still laugh-out-loud funny,"Clearly written during the dot-com boom, this book is nevertheless enjoyable for its laugh-out-loud humor. It's written tongue-in-cheek as a guide to enjoy work - you're there most of the time, might as well have fun. Being devious is key. Some of the practical ""jokes"" that readers have sent to Scott Adams border more on cruelty than humor, but hey, you wouldn't take this advice seriously anyway. Reading it in the dot-bomb era is fun, too, as it shows the ""take this job and shove it"" attitude that the stock option days led to.The latter part of the book is Scott Adams' musings on creativity and humor. He tries to keep the same tonality as in the rest of the book, but you can tell he's a bit more thoughtful about this. It, too, is a good read, albeit different than the first part of the book."
3,"First part great, lamely limps home","Although at times I thought I had slipped into a parallel universe where Dave Barry draws Dilbert cartoons, (and would that be a bad thing?) the first part of the book is very very funny. It also continues to show how Mr. Adams really does know the dangers and humor that are an integral part of the modern corporate environment. Suddenly, (maybe to make the whole thing book length) the book swerves to cover territory like ""How to be funny."" Proving a time honored truism, ""The analysis of humor is usually not funny."" Supposedly the goal is to teach someone how to add humor to the work environment but that would be like my posting of a Dilbert cartoon on my wall making me a cartoonist. And the chapter on handling criticism is only there to give Mr. Adams to attack a book that no one I know gave any credibility to begin with. It does come across as mean and petty, but mostly just as unnecessary."
2,Diamonds In The Rough,"There are a few good bits in this collection of stories by today's best-known young (mostly British) authors. Nick Hornby's ""NippleJesus"" is my favorite thing he has ever written, and Hornby is one of my favorite authors. Also good is a story by Colin Firth, an actor who really should write more often. The best story in the set is narrated by a cook in a prison's kitchen, who has the chore of preparing last meals for the condemned. But many of the rest are poor. The wonderful and brilliant Dave Eggers submits a gimmicky story narrated by a dog. It seems like he had the clever idea of such a story, but couldn't make it do anything but roll over and play dead. And Helen Fielding, who I'd never read before and don't plan to ever read again, submits a piece that proves why so many of my acquaintances find her irritating."
4,A Great Cause and A Fantastic Read,"These are short stories for those who ususally skip them. Hip, funny, unique and fresh, this consistently clever collection will grab you and won't let go. I particularly enjoyed Dave Eggers' ""After I Was Thrown in the River and Before I Drowned"" and Nick Hornby's own ""NippleJesus"".Proceeds from this book go to two schools--one in the U.S, the other in the U.K.--for children with autism. Definitely a worthwhile purchase!"
3,Not all best selling authors can write short stories,"When I saw the line-up of authors on the cover of this book, I was expecting to be blown away. There were a few stories that stood out from the rest, but I felt like the majority of them were stories I would have seen in a fiction class, not a published collection of stories. ""NippleJesus"", by Nick Hornby, was probably my favorite, along with ""PMQ"" by Robert Harris. Colin Firth's ""The Department of Nothing"" struck a sentimental chord, but I'd say the rest were about average, not leaving too much of an impact. As a result, the book took a while to get through. I guess not all best-selling novel authors are meant to cross over into the short story genre - either that or we are seeing their weaker ones in this collection.One thing worth mentioning, however, is that a portion of the proceeds from this book goes to two different schools for autistic children. So even if you think the book [is bad], at least you know it wasn't all for naught."
4,"You either like him, or he leaves you ho-humming...","I like him. If you do not already own his full scores to several films and a handful of television series, this is a great sampler because you get some jazz, some romance, some sweeping themes and some vocal treatments. His work for ""Peter Gunn"" and ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" and ""Pink Panther"" were big sellers back in the day, and well-composed, well-played music is a comfort forever."
5,I LOVE HENRY MANCINI MUSIC...,"This cd brings one of the most beautiful pieces from Mancini and I love to hear that one and again, and again..."
4,A generous helping....,"Not a perfect sample of Mancicni's rich and award filled musical career, but probably as much as you could get on one CD. Here and there I would've included different cuts, but you can't please all the fans all the time."
3,Typical Mancini,"First, I really like Mancini's music generally and I am really concerned that he may be one of the greats of American music who will soon be forgotten if he hasn't been already. (US music schools tend to be a little snobby and don't give a number of truly great American composers their due.) However, the mix of this particular CD is simply too average. Many good songs are not on it and some weak ones are. I would not recommend this CD except to ManciniPhiles like me."
2,You are paying for the princess label,"I bought this for me daughter and I have to admit she loves it because it is ""princess"", but the overall quality seems cheap / flimsy. Honestly, my first impression was it was something I bought at the dollar store that had princess stickers on it. The tray that comes with it does not hold all the pieces (it is too small). I paid around $20 including shipping, but saw the same set in my neighborhood Wal-Mart for $9. If your daughter loves princess anything as much as mine, it might be worth overpaying. If you are looking for a durable tea set that is constructed of quality materials, I would look at the Fisher Price Musical Tea Set which is also one of Amazon's Editor's Choice. At the time of review the Fisher Price Musical Tea Set was only $4 more than the Disney Princess Tea Set. We have both and I know the FP will long outlast the princess tea set."
5,Great Book!,This was a great visual. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone. The photos were detailed and can be used in many discussions. Enjoy!
4,"nice shoes, but VERY small","These were nice, lightweight budget jazz shoes; however, they do NOT fit the same as street shoes, despite what the description says. My daughter wears a 2.5 in street shoes, and I ordered her a 4 in the jazz bootie thinking there would be plenty of room for growth. WRONG! I have to return them and get her at least a 5 or maybe a 5.5. BEWARE!"
3,I know better..........,"I know to read the reviews on anything at Amazon that has a review, and I am considering ordering it.Every time I don't it cost me money. So people if you order something leave a review so we will know if it a good product.Oh, and this product, the dance shoes, they are so thin and flimsy! Definitely going BACK!"
2,NOT street shoe size!,"Although the description of these booties says they run true to size, they do not! I ordered a full size and a half larger than my daughter's regular shoe size and they were still too small for her to put on her feet. Now I have to pay more shipping for an exchange. Not a great transaction experience."
4,Waiting for a sequel,"A ripping good yarn. The author knows how to bring scenes to life, make sharp points with a few choice words and put the TV business into perspective. I was sorry when it ended, and would buy a sequel."
1,Tabloid Infantile,"Truly an amazing accomplishment. The author manages to take the evolution of television's most exciting genre (tabloid)... and tell the story in a manner that's dull as dirt. How could the person who wrote this take any kind of credit for the sharply written stories that came to epitomize ""Hard Copy,"" and ""A Current Affair?"""
1,Tabloid Boring,"This book is long-winded and not very interesting. The writing is not very good, and the characters all seem very one-dimensional."
1,Did I Miss Something?,Did I buy the right book? What's all this Tabloid Baby Talk?The Tabloid Baby I read was probably the worst literary buy I've made in months. What an egotistic crock of show business hooey!Save your money for something REALLY meaty... like the next novel by Danielle Steele or Jackie Collins.
2,Too frank,"While I think the discussion of his struggle with his sexual orientation is valid, I found the graphic depictions of these ""struggles"" to be too much for me to stomach. His stories about the early days of Hard Copy weren't as good as the reviews led me to believe. It's not a horrible book, but it ain't Shakespeare!"
1,"LIES, LLLIIIEEESSS, L-I-E-S!","If you are willing to buy into the lies, deceit and exaggerations this book is made of, go ahead and fork out your 27 bucks (though I suspect it'll sell for 1.99 at Target in just a few weeks, but anyway...) While the cattiness is fascinating, you will not learn anything that's guaranteed to be true. I know because I worked for two of the shows the ""author"" tries to wreck and, I tell you, this book is mostly a bunch of personal re-interpretations of the truth tied together by a few flimsy facts so that people who don't know what really happened will buy into it. ""Tablod Baby"" is just another wanna-be, er, make that ne'er-will-be producer's poison-pen revenge against the show biz power brokers who will probably keep him forever out of the biz. And I couldn't agree more with the reviewer who wonders how this book is getting one rave a day if it lays at the bottom of the heap in terms of Amazon sales. Might all those reviews come from...? Nah, he wouldn't, would he?"
2,"Blah, blah, blah","This book covers the birth of tabloid television journalism from its seemly beginnings in the 80's. I have always found these type of shows to be a guilty pleasure. I found that the people behind the shows are indeed as uncontrollable and uncouth as I imagined. This testosterone fueled book is impossible to read. It jumps from one story to the next, the language is over the top and it commits the very worst sin of tabloid reporting....it is boring! Way too long."
5,"""EROTIC, IMPULSIVE AND INSPIRED...""",Kearns writes his account of the rise and fall of Tabloid TV with passion and guts. The book moves from one exciting chapter to the next. It made me laugh - it made me cry. Thank God he has lived to tell about it!
5,JAMMIN LOOK @ TABLOID TV BIZ,"Great book! I am not a fan of tabloid tv & do not watch shows like Hard Copy, Access Hollywood, Inside Edition, etc. but this cat gets down with his K-A account of the behind the scenes action in the tab tv biz. I really have nothing in common with the main perps in the book or can relate to the mainstream white establishment runnin the joint, but I couldn't put this book down. Big time props to Kearns. Hope this dude makes a lot of scratch off this one, cause he won't work this gig again."
5,"Forthcoming, audacious... and chuckle-making","Mr. Kearns spins a ribald tale of journalism's more unsavory characters and operations, with a wit and self-deprecation that heralds him as one of the more relevant media wags brandishing a word processor. His work is refreshingly forthcoming, boldy audacious and more often than not, chuckle-making."
4,Ozzy and Zakk Attakk!,"I was a bit skeptical with this album because ""Down To Earth"" really crashed and burned in 2001. But I think that's because Zakk wasn't allowed to write any of the material, and just played on it.Since Zakk co-wrote the material on ""Black Rain"" the edge is back in Ozzy's stuff! The beefy riffs, the grit, and even the ballads work well much like ""Ozzmosis"". However, my favorite is ""Countdown's Begun"" This track is off the scale!!Of course let's not forget Michael Bordin's chops, and Blasko's great bottom-end! Nicely done! Welcome back, Ozzy!"
4,"No... It's Not ""Crazy Train""...","Thank God! Not to say that I don't absolutely love earlier Ozzy, but I'm just thankful he's isn't remaking songs over and over again like some of you ""fans"" want. He already made those songs... now for something new!And for you idiots who think his music is ""too political"" now, when the hell wasn't it?? Ever remember hearing f***ing ""War Pigs""????????This is a great, rocking album."
1,"Hey Ozzy, beg for Bob Daisley's forgiveness!!!","I knew this album would stink after I heard the first single, ""I Don't Want to Stop."" The chorus is so generic and the song is completely forgettable. I have no idea how anyone could give this 5 stars. Diary - 5 stars. Blizzard - 5 stars. Tribute - 5 stars. Ozzy needs to get Bob Daisley on the phone, beg on his hands & knees for his forgiveness, then plead with him to write music AND lyrics for his next album. Take any song off the first two Ozzy records and compare them to any song off of this garbage; there is no comparison. Diary & Blizzard had brilliant song writing (courtesy of Randy Rhoads, Bob, Lee Keerslake & Ozzy) phenomenal playing, and chemistry. Nothing Ozzy has done since has measured up to those classics."
4,Pretty Good Stuff...,"The songs that rock:- Black Rain- Civilize The Universe- Countdown's Begun- I Don't Wanna Stop- Not Going Away- SilverThe rest of the songs are filler, in my opinion of course."
5,ozzy,loved the cd. really enjoyed the music and shared with friends who liked it also. will buy from again when looking for music.
4,CD is good 2 tx to Ozzfest Rocks,Props to Ozz for giving free tx for his fans but the live Randy Rhodes songs sounded like somebody punched Old Ozzy in the throat=( The cd I like the rock songs skip the I Love Sharon songs. after R.R. era get this after Ozzmosiss Hits Speak --- Devil
1,I guess Sharon is proud ozzy shouldn't be,"I am old enough to have been there in the day when the wizard of OZ first hit with Black Sabbath. Great Stuff. Then when OZZY went solo, better stuff. This new stuff is very poor stuff, even my late 20s and late 30s aged co-workers held their nose (both ozzy fans). Its a stinker, repetitive, muddy, tired"
1,Good Coaster,"I thought Ozzy hit an all time low with ""Down To Earth"", until now. This is by far his worse release ever. The only song thats close to decent is ""I Dont Want To Stop"", but maybe he should! The rest of the songs are generic filler songs that will never see air play. I have to believe people are buying this soley for the Ozzfest tickets. Nice marketing Sharon! I have a hard time believing that the positive reviews are credible. C'mon, the guy can't even remember lyrics anymore and has to stare into a teleprompter on stage, glued to the same spot. Sorry to say but its time for Ozzy to hang it up as far as new material is concerned. Hate me if you will but if you want good material, stick to pre-""Down To Earth"" releases."
1,save your money,not worth the 14.99 you have two songs worth listening tothe cd package is a pissed off some cheap thin cardboard sleeveand the music industry wonders why we download music illegal.
2,Worst packaging EVER!,"Instead of discussing the music to death, because it's something you should decide for yourself on whether it's good or bad, I'm here to discuss packaging of the disc.In today's age of trying to lure and entice the customer into purchasing an actual physical product over downloading it, one would think the record label/management team would at least house the disc in a respectable albeit standard jewel case or digipak. There's no booklet, no liner notes anywhere, no effort. It's barely a slipcase, which is just enraging, I almost feel like I have a promo.Ok, I'll include a short note about the music...it's the usual fare, nothing outstanding, and honestly, the thumb harmonic/vibrato Zakk Wylde pulls off every 3 seconds is incessantly annoying at this point in 2007...jeez, doesn't this guy progress?Thanks for reading."
1,uninspired effort,"I don't blame ozzy as much as i do zakk wylde. the songs sound like leftover b-side BLS songs, throwaway tracks with patheticly boring guitar riffs and zakk's weakest solo efforts of his career. not only are the riffs as stock and generic as the lyrics / vocals, but the songwriting is so weak that even a diehard ozzy fan will skip each track in hope that the next is worth it. ozzy's voice sounds so computerized and proves that if your not going to write a decent cd, than why taint your legacy? they complain that down to earth (2001) was weak but at least it had some good songs and ozzy sounded like himself, it was original and zakk's drunk out of shape guitar playing ruined this album, as it plaguaed his leads on the last one. he's washed up and forgot what it means to be a guitar hero. they said this album would be the one to blow away no more tears (1991), yet is by leagues ozzy's weakest album of his career, solo or with sabbath."
1,St. Anger,"I was really excited when i thought ozzy was coming back strong. After the last cd I hoped he'd go back to the ozzmosis sound or possibly farther back. Ofcourse not. The only good thing about this cd is that I got two free seats to ozzfest that would have been 80-100 dollars otherwise. This is almost as big of a dissapointment as when Metallica released St. Anger minus a few good moments on the cd. The difference is that Ozzy isn't going around saying its the best thing he has ever done because he's done so many great things and knows it is no match. I just have a hard time believing it's zakk wylde on the album. It does sound like him, however I can't believe he would do this to ozzy. I just hope he keeps on trucking until he croaks."
4,A very enjoyable album from OzzY....,"I don't understand the low rating on this album, it's very enjoyable...it definitely reminds me of Ozzy's last album 'Down to Earth' except it's more upbeat this time around. If you really liked Ozzy's last album, then I think you will enjoy this one."
1,Bad album.,"Stop making albums like this. Awful. Last good one you made was No More Tears. Even I, one of your biggest fans is unwilling to shell out another dime to these bad recordings. Sorry Oz."
4,Ozzie,I bought this cd for my son who really enjoys listening to Ozzie..really good........bought it thru Amazon got it in a few days..
2,Time to hang it up?,"There is only 3 good songs on here and the rest is Filler, I'm hoping Ozzy reunion with Black Sabbath later this year is better then this. The Title Song ""Black Rain"" is like a modern version of ""War Pigs"" is by far the best song on the Album> Buy at your own risk>"
2,Maybe He Should Stop,"First of all let me give a comment on the packaging. It's a piece of cardboard that folded in half with a slit on one half that contains the disc. If you open the cover you'll find the album's title inside. No pictures, no lyrics, no band credits. Nothing except the title of the CD so that left me a bit disappointed.That was nothing compared to the disappointment of listening to this CD itself. The songs aren't terrible. But not one song stands out. I saw a review that mentioned the ""No More Tears"" CD. On that disc every song is distinguishable. ""Mr. Tinkertrain"" ""Mama, I'm Coming Home"", the title track, ect all stand on their own. All the songs on this disc sound pretty much alike, and the sound like songs Ozzy had recorded in this past.For years fans have been promised a new Black Sabbath CD with Ozzy on vocals. It sounds as if he tried to make a Sabbath CD with Zack Wylde and another bassist and drummer. Too bad this CD misses the mark."
2,Stick to your TV show OZ,"Typical Ozzy CD, first 2 songs are good, the rest go straight downhill from that. Buy the first 2 songs off iTunes and save yourself the $$$. Not worth the space on the IPOD if you ask me. Sorry Ozz... you did some good stuff and you were in the first Heavy Metal band so I'll cut you some slack. However, time to sit back, look for the remote and let the young guys take over."
1,Piece of Junk!!!,"I sure hope OZZY's upcoming release is FAR BETTER than Black Rain!!! Just a dull, computerized piece of junk... NOTHING stands out on this effort with the exception of how awful it is! The second track has got to be up with some of OZZY's worst (like So Tired, Slow Down, Secret Loser and Mama, I'm Coming Home). Stick to the M-E-T-A-L and the ""Prince of Darkness"" will return! Stay away from this CD unless you're simply a collector."
1,don't buy it,"i didn't listen to cd, but when i saw the package, i tought it is a joke - it isn't written which musician plays on album ... DON'T BUY IT"
4,GOOD CD-BAD CD CASE,"You can't go wrong with Ozzy, he is a rock and roll legend. If you are a true fan then you will buy this CD regardless, but if you are a new fan then you need to start off with early Black Sabbath and then Blizzard of Ozz and work your way up. The songs on Black Rain are heavy but there are a couple of slow ones. My biggest complaint, which caused me to drop a star off of the rating, is the way that this CD comes packed. It's just a cheap piece of cardboard and the CD just slides in and out into a cardboard sleeve which gives more of a risk of damaging the CD. There are also no liner notes or pictures. Other than that the CD, to me, is a good ol' rock and roll heavy metal CD. It's definetly better than all of this new crap nowadays that radio is trying to pass off as heavy metal. So just buy it and crank it up!"
4,Its Ozzie,"You get a burned out pot bellied homebody, still willing to stumble around and ramble for a paycheck. Whats there not love."
4,Clasic Ozzman,"God sometimes I really hate you jerks that write reviews and put off people that mind find something not only classic but at a quality level of which most only dream. Three of the tracks I don't want to stop, Trap door & Not going away are blistering Ozzy Classics with Zaake at his best. The remaining tracks are classic Ozzy heavy but melodic songs remeber those! I mean what are you comparing it to snoop dog or Beyonce ! (talk about only two good songs) Static X ? Original and rockin but most sound the same. Who from this era is still making music of this caliber..... Aerosmith ( been awhile now ) Ted Nugent (past it) Judas Preist's last album was incredible , Iron Madien (done) . So I guess the point might be who compares to the still original still heavy still going strong Ozzman? Answer nobody so give the Old Man a break lets see how you rock at 55. So sit down shut up crank it up and revel in the last man standing at the hard rock show ...Thank you Ozzy WE LOVE YOU ALLLLLL!!!!"
3,It's Ozzy - and he goes green,"Come on - It's ozzy. It'll never be his best album, but how many 'best albums' do we see at his age? I doubt when i want to hear ozzy, I'll think to put this CD in first, but at least he gave us something above the static they're putting on the radio these days. Ozzy's career has become one of leisure, and I think rightfully so. He's given so much to music that he has earned the right to put out albums like this in his latter career. I own this CD because I own every ozzy album. It's not his best, but it's not bad either and there are a couple of songs definitely worth hitting 'repeat.'"
2,Black Rain (2007),"Okay, first of all I am a big fan of Ozzy, but Black Rain is a disappointment. There is really nothing to recommend about the album. I don't wanna stop is easily the highlight of the album, and I doubt it's going to become an Ozzy classic. The cd itself is okay while it's playing, but it's one of those albums that when it's over nothing really leaves a lasting impression. Every previous Ozzy album has at least had about a handful tunes, that are still in my head once the album is finished playing. If you didn't like Ozzmosis or Down to Earth, you might as well avoid Black Rain, cause both albums are much better than this. The packaging of the album is very poor too. For the what the album cost, I think you should get a jewel case, and a booklet. Instead you get some cheap cardboard case that will probably scratch up your cd, if you ever play after the first listen."
3,Prince of mediocrity,"The first two songs on Ozzy's new CD, ""Not Going Away"" and ""I Don't Wanna Stop"", get everything off to a good start and the last two ""Countdown's Begun"" and ""Trap Door"" end it with a bang. The songs in the middle, however, drag the whole thing down. Countdown and Trap Door are great metal songs. Not Going Away and Don't Wanna Stop are good songs although I don't think their heavy enough to be metal. Everything in the middle is Ozzy light. I don't know if it's age or he's just trying something different, but it's not what I expect from Ozzy Osbourne. Although, maybe with the bizarre celebrity he's become over the last ten years, I should expect it. The songs in the middle of this CD aren't bad, but they aren't special either and they certainly aren't Ozzy from his early Blizzard of Oz days. If the rumors of a new Black Sabbath CD are true, hopefully they won't fall into this same mediocrity."
4,Great Record,"This release is better than 90% of music out there today and coming from almost a 60 year old, it shows just how great Ozzy is. No, it doesn't set a benchmark like Black Sabbath or his early solo records, but it doesn't have to. If anyone is established in the music industry, he is. I would have like to have seen a twelve song album (with two more rockers) but I'm happy to have anything new from the mighty Oz!"
2,Slapped together fast and poorly done,"If you don't like the album down on earth than don't bother buying this album. It just continues the generic riffing of the previous album. Zakk Wylde is so full of it when he says this album is pure and raw but yet going back to the integrity of Blizzard, Diary and Sabbath. Either though his solos are great on this album, the riffs are generic and some of these songs just sound like black label society leftovers (yeah, not the good BLS stuff)The first signle ""I don't wanna stop"" really rocks. I'm not going away is a black label sounding tune but easily the worst album opener ozzy osbourne ever used. The third track Black Rain is so so but nothing that'll knock your socks off.Unfortunately the rest of the album falls into the category of the first track off Black Label's Sonic Brew album and thats ""bored to tears""."
1,Amazon Inc.,"I ordered this CD and paid for overnight delivery. Amazon sends me a Honda Auto Repair Manual instead. Then as I voiced complaints on 5 differant occasions, Amazon never contacted me about correcting their mistake.Don (wolfsake@aol.com)"
2,they should of called it Black Crap,"I was so looking forward to hearing a new Ozzy cd. But just like Operation Mindcrime 2 and the new Megadeth, I was so disappointed. The only two songs i care for are the last two on the cd."
1,Just too political...,"Ozzy's ""No More Tears"" has always been one of my favorite albums. After hearing ""I Don't Wanna Stop"" I was really looking forward to this album. As soon as I bought it, I ripped it to my Oakley Thumps and went running. The first two songs were great. Then it turned into an annoying diatribe against the war and the military. Hey Ozzy, thanks for calling our soldiers ""slaves."" We really appreciate the support!If you are a koolaid drinking liberal who thinks the bad guys will all just go away if we leave them alone, you'll love this album. Ozzy's been neutered.This album is no longer on my Thumps. I replaced him with Within Temptation's ""The Heart of Everything"" They rock!"
3,Sony label won't play on a Sony PS2!!!!,"I love the Ozz, hate the packaging, but strangely enough, this SONY label won't play on the SONY Playstation 2 !!! All other CD's, DVD's, games play flawlessly on the PS2...! The CD will play on other players but WILL SKIP on the PS2. I wonder what CD sounds like, I've yet to play it in its entirety, way too Much SKIPPING!"
1,Gore- Osbourne '08,"I'll try to keep it brief. The recycled cardboard case is your first clue. Zakk? Underused. First 2 songs meet expectations. The rest? i just cannot get by the 4th grade content. The lyrics are embarrassing at best. it is hard to swallow a multi millionaire telling me that my country and I are greedy. (the very country that made him what he is) It is also clear that Ozzy now has a new god. ALGORE! Just pathetic. I have been a fan since 83', and can play every riff and most leads to this day. I just cannot not stomach this one! ozzy clearly has been spending too much time in Commywood. I think Sharon , who is clearly enamored with hollywood, has brainwashed him with all the typical left wing Barbara Streisand. Ozzy is done. But hey, there is still Zakk and BLS. (thank god, the real god. )"
3,Osbourne CD,"My husband loves the music, but we found the cardboard cover to be cheap. Wondered why there wasn't a typical plastic cover for it."
1,"Hey Ozzy, beg for Bob Daisley's forgiveness!!!","This album stinks on a major scale. The second I heard the single I knew this album would never measure up to Ozzy's earlier work. Hey Ozzy, get Bob Daisley on the phone, beg for his forgiveness, and plead with him to write music & lyrics for your next album. Then, after you make ammends, re-release Diary & Blizzard with Bob & Lee playing their respective parts."
4,"Very good album, very consistent.","At first, I was not blown away by this. But after a few more spins, I really started to like it. It is not as heavy as some of his earlier stuff, but it is better than most of his later work. I like most of the songs. There are no big standouts, but not any really low points either. The album is pretty even and if you like any other work from Ozzy, you probably will enjoy this.My favorite track is ""Lay Your World On Me"" and my least favorite is ""Trap Door"".My favorite Ozzy album is ""No More Tears"" followed by ""No Rest For The Wicked"" which were the first 2 albums Ozzy used Zakk Wylde. I do also really like ""Diary Of A Madman"", but only for the few standouts it has. I did not care much for ""Down To Earth"" which was the last album Zakk was on.Along with this album, I am currently listening to Megadeth-United Abominations, Dream Theater-Systematic Chaos, and Kamalot-Ghost Opera."
3,Not an instant classic but good never the less.,"I think some of these reviews are a little harsh. No, this album doesn't break any new ground but overall it's a solid and enjoyable addition to Ozzy's canon. The musicianship is top-notch as always and Ozzy's voice is still strong despite his age and years of hard-core drug and alcohol abuse. Speaking of which, the fact that he is still alive and recording new music defies logic so there's no need to be so critical of his work. Seriously, how many times can you hear Crazy Train and not go off the rails yourself? That song has been used in a lame car commercial and I've also heard high school and college bands playing it at ball games. Enough of the classics already, I like hearing fresh music from the artists I've enjoyed for many years and that certainly includes Ozzy. It's a good album, check it out!"
5,BEST ALBUM,"I don't know what those people who are doubting this album are saying. This is the best ozzy album since No More Tears. It sounds very overproduced, and heavy. The Almighty Dollar is a funky kinda sounding song that unleashes Mr. Wild's heavy riffs throughout. I Don't Wanna Stop is probably the most catchy song on the album and it's quit an athem. Also, Not Going Away kicks ***. It is also quit catchy. There are only really two ballads on the album, Lay Your World on me, but its a pretty good ballad, and Here For You, which is good as well. The rest of the 8 songs are rock'n and catchy. Some of the riffs kind of even remind me a little of Jake E Lee days. So some of it has the intensity of the Ultimate Sin, but with the production of No More Tears. This cd rocks! It's good to know the ozzman is back"
4,Great comeback from the Prince of Darkness,"I'll be honest, I've been half wishing for Ozzy to retire for a few years now. His voice has become comical, and his last album Under Cover, was very sub-par. But then he decides to finally release an album sober, and the first impression results are great. ""I Don't Wanna Stop"" is his best song since the No More Tears days, and there are also a few standout songs like Not Going Away and Trap Door. I will have to take a more in depth listen to find some other gems, but the first impression is definetelly that of a solid album."
5,why aren't they more popular!?,"There is not a bag song on here and it is well worth the new copy price. It's moody, melodic, and pleasant music that's more accessible than other Saddle Creek bands."
2,Doesn't Make The Team,"I bought a couple of these some time ago and I'll have to admit, I wasn't expecting too much. The multimeter itself is very cheaply made and the probes are very flimsy and of low quality. As one of the other reviewers stated the batteries are a pain to replace. It takes (6) LR44 button cell lithium batteries enclosed in a seperate plastic housing. The meter itself is ok for anything that doesn't require precision or fine tolerances. You are better off buying a cheap Craftsman (Sears) multimeter for around the same price."
1,It's a toy,"I do not trust this meter it feels like a toy. It is only a class 2 meter which means it is not safe for anything bigger than residential circuits. I will only trust mine for testing batteries. For those reviews that say they're using it at work, they are trusting their life with a $15 dollar meter. The best feature is the lack of a power saver function. If you leave it on or the unit gets turned on because it has no case, it drains its battery. The lack of storage for the leads also makes it harder to carry and store without damaging them. I am not even going to waste the money on replacing the 6 LR44 batteries. All in all it is a waste of money, DO NOT buy this meter."
2,Very delicate..,"The unit does its job alright.. but its just too delicate. After plugging in the cables a few times, the connectors jack broke. Now I have to solder a new connector to the board. I just got another one instead."
4,Good instrument,"This is a good instrument for casual, not professional use. For the price, it is a bargain, for the quality, it is good enough. I could not find anything comparable."
5,This book makes it easy!,"I have a new three level house and wanted to connect all the family computers onto one network. Drilling holes in the floors and running wires all over the place is definitely not my thing, so I started to look around for another solution. After learing about wireless networking (wi-fi), I can't imagine why anyone would use anything else.This wi-fi book answered all my questions. Even though I was nervous about opening up a computer and putting a wi-fi card in, this book took me through it with steps and pictures. I've looked at the other wi-fi books at the bookstore, but this one definitely stuck out. Lots of good pictures and directions."
3,Remember the date!,"This book is OK, if you are living in 2004, when it was written. As you well know, times change, and they change really quickly in our day and age. If you buy a book from this vendor, you will find that you get quick service, and a good product. Just make sure YOU do your home work like I DIDN'T, and you won't be disappointed with the poor choice YOU made."
2,Beginner's Guide - Not,"I really wanted a guide to help me understand wireless connections and networking. Two issues with this book: 1) it repeats, sometimes multiple times (i.e. ""refer to Ch 14 for more details""), 2) Unless I completely missed it, the book covers Ad-hoc network setup but completely missed Infrastructure setup - which is what I was looking for. In the end, I've got more questions now than when I bought this book."
1,Over The Hill,"Over The Hill - didn't get to watch it, it pulled when placed in the VCR, don't know if it was the VCR or the tape! Bad deal, all the way around! Don't know if I can return the product or not."
3,Good,"Affordable gadget for your child. In a shopping mall, the signal goes quite far but am not talking kilometers here and is not the point. Does what is says, and you can easily locate your child if he/she is out of your vision during a brief moment of inattention. This is under no case a tracking device and does not mean for parents that they can completely leave there child unattended."
3,Occasional Use Only,"Great for special occasion use such as going to Disney etc. Battery wore out very fast. My daughter, who is 3, didn't like it on her shoe and she doesn't wear belts so perhaps the manufacture can look at providing an additional clip for putting in her hair as a pony tail."
2,It works but has not good operation,"I purchase this product for my 2 years child but when i tried it a problem accrued because baby section beep loudly for you to find your child!! child will panic and if somebody hold your child, he/she knows that your baby carry's security system??!! It is better for me to remote control beep and show me where my child is."
2,Amazon very slow in shipping,Amazon had told me I would have it by tomorrow and they are just shipping it today with an expected delivery in 8 more days. This has got to be the worst experience I've had with amazon shipping.
3,Okay,The battery in the receiver was dead when we got it. This item requires a special battery that is expensive. Once the battery was replaced it worked well.
1,Defective - Had to return twice and finally gave up,"I really wanted this locator, as my son has a habit of disappearing in a split second. Unfortunately, when I received the first one, the red button kept blinking and the transmitter never activated. I re-read the directions and looked at the products website, to no avail. Amazon customer service was great and sent a replacement. Unfortunately the replacement locator did the exact same thing. I understand that every so often their is a defective item, but two in a two week span? I would have to say that I do not recommend Mommy I'm Here Child Locator in Brown, and probably not any product from Mommy I'm Here."
1,Doesn't work,"I read a lot of reviews on multiple child locators, and this had the best reviews and was a great price. I just received it and it doesn't work. It supposedly comes with long lasting batteries already installed. To activate the locator you simply turn it on and a light blinks. Then you push the button and are supposed to hear a few faint beeps. The light started blinking, but after pushing the button, I heard nothing. I've been trying for about 20 mins - still no sound. I tried calling the customer service number and no one answers the phone there. It goes straight to voicemail. This is a total waste of money, and time."
1,waste of time,"the bear blinked but the key chain didnt have power,bad battery ? dont waste your time or money."
4,great product,"Super cute. We call it a shoe buddy. The beep is loud, and worked well. My son is a runner, but I don't feel comfortable using a harness. Would have five stars except that it stopped working after my son jumped in a puddle with it. It should be more water proof. Still, I would buy this product again, and maybe clip it somewhere else if its really wet out."
5,Great product!,"Works great! My little guy (3) is super active and I got it for when we are out at stores or amusement parks. Afraid he may run off. Tested it a few times and the alarm is very loud. I went over it with little guy and he understands that if bear beeps, he is to stop where he is and call out for us. We are happy with this product! It isn't a babysitter, but it does give piece of mind. Not sure about battery life yet, but may go out and buy an extra battery to keep with us when we are using the bear, just in case."
4,"Good product, Great customer service!","We have clipped this on our 3-year old daughter twice. Only once did we use it, when she hid in the middle a clothes rack at a store. I knew approximately where she was, but I used the device to signal to our daughter that this was not a safe practice. I think that it worked well to get her attention.After two uses, for some unknown reason it stopped working. Customer service has replied speedily to our e-mails and is sending a replacement."
3,Ok concept. Better product can be made.,"I have used this product at Seaworld and at San Diego Zoo.Pros:- loud beeps- compact transmitter- cute teddy bearCons:- very sensitive transmitter button. Slightest pressure applied to the button trigers the system to start beeping. Annoying to other people around you.- Teddy bears are a bit big for a 2 yr old compared to shoe size, which is where it's supposed to be worn. Hopefully, future versions can make the Teddies a bit smaller.Overall I would give the product 3 to 4 stars. Definetely adds that extra layer of protection if kids disapear suddenly as toddlers can."
1,does not work,I received the product within a few weeks and it was in a sealed package however i opened the product up and it would not turn on. i did read several reviews about the product not working but i took a chance because of the cost. bad mistake...i guess i will attempt to buy new batteries for it to see if that will work.
2,a yelling device,too much noise for nothing. when my daughter moves a little faster than normal even if she is by my side it starts yelling. Had to turn it off as it wasn't doing what it was supposed to.Also the material of the strap is so poor and hard that it hearts her and even cut her arm once.it's an amazing idea but needs a little more thinking so it performs better.
3,could be better If it functions as I thought,"There is not enough explanation in how the product perform here. So I thought this was an alarm that will AUTOMATICALLY beep when it was separated beyond certain distance from its receiver.Basically this alarm functions almost similar to car ""locator"" alarm. I personally think it will be useless if my daughter slips away fast and goes beyond 150 ft.However I give it a three star because it does function to Locate a child within 150 ft BY PRESSING A BUTTONThe sound is pretty loud. Good for a very noisy environment."
2,"Power switch on the bear, really?","When I originally saw this I thought this was a great idea!! I still do BUT it make no sense to me why you would put the power switch on the bear which goes on the child. Let's face it, children play hard and crawl and climb and everything which can easily turn off the switch. Not to mention a curious child. I just don't think that was the best place to put the one thing that makes it work in the hands of the child that has no idea what that thing is or is for."
4,It works.,Luckily I haven't had to use it. I wish the clip on the bear were easier to clip on though.
1,Not worth it,"Only worked a couple days then stopped working not worth the money. Then it would start making noise on it's own and it's very annoying, and not reliable. It's a good idea only if the product worked."
3,Good product,"I purchased two of these child locator bears for each of my children as we were heading to Disneyland. There is ONE frequency for this product, so having two bears the parents remote activated both bears - when only one was normally needed as we have a 5 yo and baby. Due to the volume of Disneyland displays the alarm was difficult to hear. Under normal circumstances such as a general shopping trip the volume of the bears alarms would be adequate. It was a product that gave me peace of mind. I would recommend this product to any parent, in particular parents who have kids that like to run off."
5,A must get!!!,Tarla Dalal is excellent for Vegetarian cooking. My husband hates Vegetarian and I always have a tough time preparing meals for him when we are veg. But with this book it is sooooo much better. Her recipes are VERY Simple to follow and each of her recipes turn out DELICIOUS...from her starters to her desserts...she has them all.
4,Good product,"This product turned out to be a godsend when we got our new kitten. I was able to keep her away from her favorite electrical chords. The only thing I'd change is to make them in wider sizes, so I can use them on thicker chords. Also, they don't open and snap shut the way the directions say. You have to force the chords into the opening. But all in all, a very good product. Cut them with pruning shears."
5,perfect for speaker wires and cable wires,this is a perfect wiremolding to hide and neatly organized ur wires and cable wires into this it is very easy to do i did my livinig room and my masterroom with this i mount all my wires into the wiremolding for a neatly well organized room this is the stuff u need to blend into the wall for well suited by urself do it urself project a+++++
2,Small and flimsy,"This item is much smaller and flimsier than it looks in the picture. Not more than 2 or 3 cords will fit in it. It was also bent when I received it, and it looks cheap."
2,Product might have been good.,Item bent and damaged maybe during shipping. Sent it back for a replacement...the seller sent me the same exact one back...same box same everything. Sent it back again and got my money back. Don't remember the seller..don't care I did receive a refund and was not out any money after days of headaches.
3,Wiremold cordmate,"The product was fine but they way it appeared on online was deceiving. I was looking for a plastic molding to hold multiple cables but this holds only one, thin one."
3,Good product but,"Other reviewers have noted that once you put the covers in place with the double sided tape ""it's on for good"". That's not been the case for me. I have painted dry wall and some of these lengths have come loose. This is in spite of making sure the walls were dirt and dust free."
2,Look a little closer!,"If you want cord cover for one cord (a small one), this is it! If not, look a little closer! I paid more for shipping this item than for the item itself and I didn't have time to open for a while due to the craziness of my life! However, when I did...I was shocked at how very tiny it was and now they won't make the exchange without me paying shipping again. Not worth it.....cheaper to use for something or throw it away!"
4,Decent Indian Style Lentils,"This Indian lentil curry is somewhat soupy but is still pretty good. It has a decent taste and is neither hot nor bland. It has less fat and salt than any other ready to eat Indian curry that I have tried. However, I would prefer to see even less fat and salt before I give it five stars. Especially since salt can always be added later if needed, based on individual preference. Overall, I recommend that you do try it out."
2,could not make it to work,Item was shipped on time and I was able to install it on my lable maker but it would not print correctly.
3,Hammock chair stand,"I received the item in a timely manner, but have not assembled it yet due to bad weather and it will be used outside."
1,An assault on the ears!,"This is the worst ""reggae"" tribute album I have ever heard in my life. Most of the songs are done in a ska style, totally ruining them. For example, ""Hey You"" would have fared much better in a ""one drop"" style, making it more palatable, listenable and enjoyable. ""Run Like Hell"" away from this album! It sounds like crap compared to ""Dub Side Of The Moon"". David Gilmour & Roger Waters should sue the company that released this farce!"
3,hmmm check ou the dub,"Well I don't know. I haven't really heard this, but what I heard from the samples didn't sound too bad. That's because these people are wrong. Pink Floyd and different styles like reggae can mix, but you don't necessarily want this album to prove it.I agree with the person who recommended it:You want Dub Side Of The Moon"
2,I'd rather have a beer,"this idea sounded really interesting, listening to the samples was also really interwesting...but id rather spend that money on better stuff...like an actual floyd album! i also dont like the idea of a girl singing on some of the songs,cuz that takes away totally from the pink floyd artistic vocals(nothing against women,but unless your a freaky sheman,you can't pull that voice off). Stu makes some cool sounds on this album, and i think the vocals of Stu are better than any1 else on the album as far as impersonating pink floyd goes. but if you want variety,get this."
5,Case of Mya,"WO! You can't get better than this. ""Case Of The EX"" the great single, taken from Mya's platinum album ""Fear Of Flying"", is the best i have. ""Case Of The EX"" is a great and vibey song and the ""OMO 2-Step Club Mix"" is also great. ""Take Me There"" from the ""Rugrats"" Soundtrack is fun and light. But the biggest bonus on this single has to be Pras' ""Ghetto Superstar (That's What You Are)"" featuring Mya and O.D.B., from the ""Bulworth"" soundtrack and Pras' album ""Ghetto Superstar"". This Mega hit has a great vibe, is fun to dance to and has a great rythm. Mya couldn't have chosen a better song to be introduced in. This has got to be Mya's best single, as 3 of the 4 tracks are already singles!Stand out tracks: ""Case Of The EX"" and ""Ghetto Superstar""If you're a Mya fan, you have to get this single. If you aren't, it's one of the best buys you could get!Mya, u rock!"
5,Favorite Ornament from Childhood!,"I'm 23, I received this ornament when I was little. It is one of my favorite ornaments. Mine is broken (I was constantly playing with it, and I thought Cinderella was supposed to come off the pedestal!!!). Easily fixed with glue. I adore this series!Hallmark makes truly wonderful ornaments, and the memories last a lifetime!!!Truly brings me Christmas cheer, and looks beautiful on any tree!I cherish this ornament so much, as I do all my other Disney and Hallmark ornaments!-Liz"
4,"Good quality, better price","This is a sweet ornament. While it is plastic, it still looks good and simply can't beat the price. I'm completely satisfied."
5,best of the mazes available,"For my almost 3 year old, I wanted a toy that would last for a while. This is perfect because she can use it now and for the next year or two at least. After that, it is always a loved toy whoever plays with it.I found the others available to be too simple and limited in their use.Don't be fooled by the colors on the maze. This is a solid product and is exceptional in every way. I haven't tried it while driving in the car, but I will see if it's good for long rides as well while in the carseat.At home otherwise, it's perfect to play with mommy or another child alongside (two wands)"
3,Very sturdy,"This toy was a gift for my 4 yr old. The construction is very sturdy, thick piece of wood, durable top cover and 'pens'. My 1 yr old got a hold of a pen a dragged the toy around a bit, and the pen stayed attached and secure. Unfortunately, my child does not play with this toy. The neighborhood friends who come over have also not shown a lot of interest in it. I think it is great quality, but I guess the fun factor is just not there."
4,My maze hound likes it,"Great wood quality...seems that it will stand the test of time. My 3 year old loves doing mazes on paper so I thought he might like this. He does like it quite a bit, and likes that he can be one color and I can be another and we can ""race"" to get the balls in the circle. The only minor irritant is that the magnet pen can move 2 or 3 balls at once so they sometimes get stuck together, but with a little shaking it's fixed."
2,magnet did not grabed my children,"I bought this toy thinking that my children would love to play with it since one of them LOVES mazes, the younger one (4) could learn tracing and having better coordination, but as for now, they saw the toy, tried to play with it and left it on the table. I insisted they play in another ocasion, but my younger one thinks is too hard and the oldest(5) one thinks is not fun."
1,Fantasy,"Brun's telling of the downing of KAL 007 has be refuted long ago. His supposed transcipts of Soviet air defense pilots and controllers doesn't agree with the actual recordings, his facts can't be double checked, and none of it agrees with the declassified records that have been made available in the wake of the collapse of the USSR.So why do people continue to defend Brun, and claim that he alone is correct, and all others are somehow corrupt?Conspiracy theorists are motivated by a great many things. Some are simply looking for verification of their existing predjudices. Many revel in the ideal that they alone are privy to secret information not available to others. And some find solace in conspiracy theories that mirror their own paranoid delusions.Whatever the case, Brun's work has long been discredited- see, for example, the tremendous amount of research that Soviet aerospace expert James Oberg has put in on this at his own web pages (www.jamesoberg.com). And yet, the hysteria lingers on."
5,great,"wonderful written book proving the cover up the american government did to innocent people, including larry mc donald a congressman on the plane. they wanted him dead becasue he spoke out against the new world order and council on foreign relations."
3,Nice additon to a Tea Party,"I purchased this picnic game for my 4 year old Granddaughter for Christmas. We used the pieces of the game as food items for our tea party. The spinner would not spin, so we could not play the game. Plus, the spinner is ""clear"" so it is difficult to see where the arrow points to. If the spinner worked this game would be fine for little children."
5,Love it!,"I got this for my 2 year old daughter for Christmas and she loves it! We're working with her on playing ""by the rules"" but we also have made up other games with it. She loves setting everything up on the ""picnic blanket"". A fun game for toddlers!"
3,Spinner does not work,"I bought this game for my little girl. We got it yesterday. She was so happy and excited. Then we found the spinner does not work! Like another reviewer mentioned, it is a thin clear plastic strip, sticks so tightly to the board. It can not spin at all. I agree it is a well designed game, perfect for young children. The color is beautiful, and the board quality is very good. But without the spinner, it is useless."
3,"pretty case, but not worth the money","My 3 year daughter got this as a gift for her 3rd birthday, she loves it and takes it everywhere with her.scthe only problem is, the silver brackets located on the corners of the box all fell off. Although they are not needed, it takes awaay from the beauty and welll it should break anywayd. The finger polish brushes are made of plastic, after her first time using them she had a hard time getting the brushes back into the bottle. The makeup is junk. Overall this is not worth the money. You are better off buying a seperate case and having your daughter pick out her own make/finger polish from the value section in walmart. Less money and better products."
1,uhhh Jeezzzz,Okay. #1. How can this toy be educational? Well yeah. It's not. It's horrible. Makeup wouldn't come off. Child had to go to school looking like some kind of Britney Spears wannabe. Not a good look. Grandparents hate this thing more than I do. Blotchy appearance on face. Doesn't even feel // look like makeup.Go buy some Dior for your child.
3,A Slight Improvement...,"Hart's style and plotting truly improved in this sequel toHaunted Ground: A Novel. The pacing was much more thrilling and the plot held some surprises. Unfortunately, the relationships between the characters felt even more unconvincing (and in some cases downright silly) here. The wishy-washy romance though was the most annoying aspect of the entire novel. It was so ridiculous and simply agitating (and not in a positive romantic-plot kind of way). And though it wasn't as downright dull as the first book, I don't think that the series has improved enough that I will be continuing on with it."
4,Another page turner...,"I was thrilled to discover Erin Hart through her first novel ""Haunted Ground"" when I picked it up at a library book sale last year. It's always great to find an author who incorporates so much about the setting, its culture and people while telling an intriguing tale. The combination of detail about Ireland's history, culture, landscape, customs and the well-plotted mystery make both of her books well worth the time to read them. Due to all the detail, it may take a little longer to read than other thrillers but the payoff is a great story. ""Lake of Sorrows"" did not disappoint as we continue to follow the relationship of Nora and Cormac that started in ""Haunted Ground"". The in-depth description of them and the other main characters makes you feel like you know them and want to know more about them. I hope there will be more books in this series."
4,Solid CD By Killah,"I purchased this cd back in 2002. I wasn't suprised that the cd would be hot because of the #1 label in the game at the moment, Roc-A-Fella. Anyways, this cd is pretty solid. It's got some head bangin', pelvis pumpin' beats to it. But I'm not gonna lie, Cam does have some whack rhymes at some times. Guests: Juelz Santana, Jimmy Jones, Freekey Zekey, Daz Dillinger, Tiffany, McGruff, Jay-Z, Memphis Bleek, Beanie Sigel. Singles on this album are ""Oh Boy"", ""Hey Ma"", ""Live My Life"". Overall, this is a hot cd and it's worth a pick up. If you feel this, you should also peep out ""Diplomatic Immunity""(The Diplomats) and ""From Me To U""(Juelz Santana), two other hot Diplomats cd's.Lyrics: 5 out of 10Beats: 9 out of 10Total: 7 out of 10"
1,I only give it 1 star because there isn't 0,"You're kidding me, right? This actually sells? What makes a good rapper anyway? Honestly, anyone who wears a pink track suit with a pink hat would get clowned in the street. But let's get back to what makes this album worthy of the trash heap. Cam'ron's lyrics make no sense. It's all just random words that happen to rhyme. Most mainstream rappers fit this mold. But Cam'ron takes it to another level. It's ridiculous. I'll grudgingly admit that there are some pretty nice beats on this CD. Seems wasted considering the lack of Cam'ron's talent. My record for most wasted beats for 2003 was 50 cent. But I'm changing that to this album. I bet there's 100 underground MC's who could make a classic with any one of these tracks. To Sum it up? I'm throwing away an AOL CD to make room for another coaster that says ""Cam'ron"" on it."
1,Worst Rapper Ever,"CamRon is the best no talent rapper to ever and I mean ever breathe into a microphone. He has the nerve to drop a greatest hits album. How do you make a greatest hits album WITHOUT ONE HIT?!?!? Somebody please enlighten me. His voice is even more banal and monotone than Fabolous when he first dropped ( he's improved drastically). Heeeeee Rapppppppssss Sooooooooo Slooooooowwwwww! He has no flow whatsoever and does not rhyme a word he says and when he does rhyme it is completely wack. I'm with reviewer Mistermaxx in that CamRon has no vibe, no funkiness. It's just boring music that is used only for torture. The beats on this album are above decent but CamRon ruins it. Harlem should be ashamed...and what is his fascination with the color pink!?!? That is NOT gangsta. I can't even be bothered to review the rest of this wackness. I just feel different when I listen to wack music. I don't like the feeling. Zero stars."
3,The Beginning of the End,"This really sickens me. Although i recommend this cd it marks the beginning of cam's lyrical downfall and economic rise. I guess since he's making money off the diplomats he doesn't have be as nice WRONG. This CD shows his transition from a good rapper with great potiential to the Dr. Suess like rapper we see today. I have listened to all his CD's including purple haze and own Confessions of Fire, S.D.E., and Come Home With Me. This Cd is rather5 mediocre but it gets the job done. most tracks for the most part are great but the energy cam put in this CD is nothing compared to the his debut and sophmore album. And also what made this ablum even less appealing is the fact that he had a freestyle was on a mixtape then when i buy this cd 5 songs on it contained pieces of that freestyle. Want a Killa Cam CD go buy Harlem's Finest and his fist two albums."
2,Oh No Camron,"First of all camron you are not harlem's greatest or harlems finest. And u just come off looking mad stupid with ure retarted obbsession of pink. That Said this album isnt that good, the only decent rapper in dipset is juelz Santana and hes not even THAT good. That being said camron doesnt really rap he has like a fast talking/mumbling voice which is monotone and not exciting to listen to. Also, he makes up words like your too cool to use the 900,000 plus words that are in the dictionary. This album gets 2 stars because camron has some good beats but needs to have someone else rapp on them."
5,Look at me...I can rap like Cam'ron,"I'm killa cam, my nine goes bam, mommy spread that jam, i don't like ham, i like that damn.SEE IT'S EASY...JUST RHYME NONSENSE AND THEN GET JUELZ SANTANA TO DO AN OFF BEAT HOOK."
4,top notch instrumentals,"A+ production by Just Blaze, Kanye West and TyFyffe, but the lyrics are mostly questionable.superb tracks: F*** Losin Weight 2Come Home With MeWelcome 2 NYCDead Or AliveROCBoy BoyTomorrowannoying: I Just Wanna (samples Ginuwine)get this album, it's worth the money!"
3,Worth Buying,"This cd is good enough to buy. Theres only 4 or 5 good songs but the songs that are good you can listen to over and over.The cd starts out weak but really picks up with hot tracks Dead or Alive and ROC ft memph bleek and beans. And the hottest track on the whole cd is Boy,Boy which is now one of my favorite songs."
3,im suprised,"this album was nothing special. i like Cam'ron but he just didnt do too well here. it was too commercial and half-hearted.BEST SONGS: ""Losing Weight Pt.2""(ok but good for this album), ""Oh Boy"", ""Live My Life""(2nd best on the album), ""Daydreaming""(see Losing Weight Pt. 2), ""Welcome To NYC""(best on the album), ""Hey Ma""(overplayed though), ""Roc""(see Losing Weight Pt. 2 and Daydreaming)"
2,Oh!! Boy.................is right,"What the heck is this.........This album is below par. Camron talks a bunch of nothing. He is now in the same bag as Nore, and others that put out a bangin single and then follow up with a lackluster album. If he had the lyrical word play that he once had back in the days of Confessions in Fire mixed with the beats of the today he would be off the hook."
3,It's iight!!!,"This album isn't as bad as some reviews say!!! It has some nice songs on it....you might have to skip through some songs but that's ok because it's not that much skippin' to be done.This album did fairly good on soundscan and I think that is good for Cam!!!! But the ""Oh Boy"" cologne I don't think is going to sell really well!!! That's just me though!!!Back to the album....it's at least worth a listen if not a buy. But sometimes I don't know what the heck Cam'ron is rappin about...he makes up words like Jesse Jackson.....and that's not cool at all folks!!! Peace!!!"
3,Good for a Rocafella Album,"I can't hate on this album even though I am not a roc fan nor a Camron fan. Camron is very underrated. His lyrical skills did not explode like his previous two, but still better than some of hisROC cohorts.Only problem with this album was too many samples.Also surprising is it was'nt treated as a ROC compliation album ."
3,Respectable,"I've never delved passed the hot singles that Cam is known to drop to introduce his albums. ""Horse & Carriage"" and ""What Means the World..."" were definite bangaz and Cam maintains his M.O. with ""Oh Boy"". But peepin' the album for $8.99 I decided to take this album ""home with me"" (my bad, I couldn't help myself).Overall, the album has grown on me with it's above average production and enough guest shots from Roc-a-Fella fam. and some decent work by the Diplomats to keep it interesting. Cam's subject matter can at times get a little redundant and borderline ig'nant with the reoccuring themes of misogyny and dope man misadventures. The standout tracks are ""Losin' Weight pt. 2"", ""Welcome to NYC"" with Jay-Z serving up the hot flow, the heartfelt ""Daydreamin'"" and ""The Roc (Just Fire)"".Actually, if it were possible I'd add another half star to my rating, but just like the album I can live with something just shy of being a standout."
3,Only a few good songs,"Good album, but only a few songs I would bump real loud. I think Cam's best album is definitley SDE."
3,Cam keeps slipin after each album,"Cam'ron is back, and he's on ROC. These are my ratings1.Intro:I don't really like intros 3/102.Losing weight part 2: Ill beat, and good rappin 10/103.Oh boy:Oh boy this song got 2 overplayed 4 me to like it anymore 8/104.Live my Life:Nice song off Tupac's joint 9/105.Daydreaming:I don't really like the beat, but it's ok 6/106.Come Home wit me:The best song off da whole album 10/107.Wecome to New York city:This song is bangin' 2 10/108.Hey ma:Too overplayed, ... 7/109.On fire:Good but no great 7/1010.Stop callin:Don't really like dis 4/1011.I just wanna:I just wanna hate dis song 5/1012.Dead or alive:Finally a good joint near da end 9/1013.The ROC:Beanie had 2 be da 1 2 save dis song 8/1014.Bad Boy:It's aite but not all dat special 6/1015.Tommorw:A good closing to a bad ending 9/10Basicly da album is bangin at da beginin, but then get's oooh-so weak at the end. Even ROC records could stop him from slippin. [come] on Cam, I thought u were betta than dis, seriously!"
1,Trash...,"Cam'ron's "" come home with me"" is a dissapointment coz i actullie thought that cam's debut which was hag realy showed his lyrical skill and had tight production but chwm is pretty much lame with weak and boring lirycs from cam and others such as juelz and Jim jones, etc... Even ther production was pretty horrible. Dont buy it."
3,Went Commercial,"S.D.E. was an amazing Album. I was looking foward to this album a lot and especially after I heard the ""Oh Boy"" song on the radio. Then they played it like 4 times every hour on the radio. Then they started playing ""Hey Ma"" every hour on the radio. So it started gettin real annoying. This CD is alright, but its too commercial. If you want sum REAL hip hop, get S.D.E. it's so much better. Oh yeah, and for you people that just now heard of Cam'Ron because of the ""Oh Boy"" song, S.D.E is Cam'Ron's 2nd album.. (the album before this one)"
4,Solid Cd,"This release from Cam'ron was a solid release, but the beats really carry this album. Just Blaze and Kayne West, rip this album to pieces, they some of the best producers in the game today i think, anyways. His first single ""Oh Boy"" has been very successful and is a great track. Cam is not the best lyricist, but he holds his own. Welcome to New York is the best track on this cd, without a doubt, the beat is just amazing, the first 30 seconds of that beat is just crazy, and Jay-Z comes really nice on the track.Best TracksLosing Weight 2Oh BoyDaydreamingCome Home With MeWelcome to New York CityWanted dead or aliveThe RocTomorrowSo take a chance on this you will like it, very solid releasePeace"
3,william wise its alright,i thought it was be better then i have expexted they talk in ever song i the song oh boy an the beat the intro is a good won but a waste of good beat i like loosing weight part2 and welcome to new york city but the cd is alright
3,"His best, but not THE best","Cam's new album is obviously his best. It was smart for him 2 move from Epic to the ROC.Cam has some pretty good songs. ""Oh Boy"" is a fabulous song, and that song alone made me purchase the album. ""Hey Ma"" and ""Welcome to New York City"" are some other good songs. ""On Fire Tonight"" is a song about his... ANYWAY, there are only 2 songs that he carries alone on the album, using his best friend and collabo artist Juelz Santana on most of the songs.""Come Home With Me"" is a decent hip-hop album. He doesn't use Beanie Seagel and Memphis Bleek 2 theyre fullest potential, but still comes out with one of the better rap albums out right now."
3,Killah,"I expected more from Cam this time. I like the album but I thought it would be a lot hotter. He should have put a couple more grimey tracks on it. He almost there, I'll give him one more album to make a classic."
5,together again-1963,"The orginal Goodman Quartet is back again and as great as ever. Pick this one up fast. The sound is great,as is the music."
4,Great series but ....,"Jacques Pepin is my favorite TV chef. His technique is amazing. These recipes are from all segments of his life and they are fairly uncomplicated. I believe this series is Pepin's finest in production style and quality. And the master chef is in great form.About the DVDs, these are good video transfers but it appears that the audio has been tampered with. The TV broadcast sound quality is very good but the DVD's have an annoying distortion. I don't why they did this but it's clearly intentional because the promo ads have good audio. Also this set is not complete. There should have been 26 shows in this set but two are missing. Why did they make that odd ball decision? There's no chance they will release a DVD of the missing shows."
3,"Jacques is 5 star, but these DVDs aren't","I love Jacques and own a lot of classic cooking DVDs, but these DVDs aren't great. As several other reviewers mentioned, the audio is lousy on many episodes. In addition, my collection is missing a disc. I've returned and replaced the box set, but the same disc was missing from the replacement set. More accurately, I have the second disc in the second set twice, and no ""1 of 2"" disc. I'm debating exchanging it again since it's likely that a second replacement set would have the same error. I think I'll probably just keep the set and enjoy the 20 episodes I have. Jacques is still amazing, after all!"
2,COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER!,"i have seen this series on pbs and loved the recipes and wanted the dvd which pbs does not offer... then i find it get it and discover that the worse thing about this isn't pepin's ability to let siliva gather in his mouth and slup here and there (a habit i really wish he would break), but they had the nerve to only put a few shows on the dvd. there are 26 shows in this particular series and to have to spend the kind of money they ask for and you do not get the completed series is ridiculous. i say wait till it hits pbs in your area and tape the thing from tv."
3,party girl,Party Girl: A NovelIt was a fun book. Once i start reading it i couldn't put it down. The story is a little bit dragging in the middle. I will still buy books from this author.
2,Mediocre,This is not stand-out chick lit ~ very formulaic. Ultimately I will have forgotten I ever read this book in a couple of weeks.
1,Poise Area Rug,The rug arrived with several flaws. White areas on the border that made it look like it was worn (not in a good way).It only looks purple in bright light otherwise it looks brown.I returned a month ago and have yet to receive my refund.Very unhappy with the rug and with Home Decorators Collections.
2,Not worth the price of the book,"While the diet is a good one, there is really no reason to buy this book and get all the filler. The workout is geared for beginners. If you want something more advanced, you have to buy the edition available only from the publisher or send them an extra fee for a more advanced workout. If you can find the Men's Health article that came out before the book, you have essentially all the useful information contained in the book."
5,"So far, so good...","I haven't read it all yet, but so far, I like what I'm reading and it makes me want to jump on the bandwagon as soon as possible!"
2,where's the data?,"Interesting topic centering around the new theory of eating more protein and less carbs to lose...when mated with workouts.What's a tad troubling is that the entire ""study"" was based on 30 people, with results published for SIX!(??) No result metric is consistent from participant to participant except pullups?? is the number of pullups a person can do a true measure of fitness?Also, this book CLAIMS that following the plan raises testosterone levels...but testosterone levels were not measured in the participants? Seems if you NAME a book ""the testosterone advantage plan"" and BASE this theory on the elevation of testosterone levels, that you might want to actually MEASURE them?no physician collaborated on this book, nor a nutritionist. so you're taking the word of fitness experts/journalists. It's more of a fleshed-out Mens health article than a real study or plan...and written in true mens-health-caveman-get-girl style.just not for me I'm afraid..."
1,Selling the Meat and Dairy industry,"I was extremely disapointed with the content of this book. Whilereading I found myself constantly asking how much the meat and dairy industry paid to have this written. I have to believe that Lou Schuler sold out. I will not waste time with a full review. If you are truly looking for help in the testosterone arena I will recommend a couple of other books that I found very helpful.""Maximize Your Vitality & Potency"" by Jonathan V. Wright MD and Lane Lenard Ph.D. Also ""The Testosterone Syndrome"" by Eugene Shippen M.D. & William Fryer. These were well written and very helpful with science to back them up. I am 50 years old and have significantly raised my testosterone levels following the information provided in these books. As I implemeted the strategies I had my Doctor draw blood samples every 3 months and we watched a steady rise in my free testosterone levels. Good luck in your persuit of better health."
3,"New Perspective, No New Info","Very persuasive in it's presentation that men have to eat like men, but outside of that there is really no new info. Probably an easier way to begin a healthy diet/lifestyle."
2,the rich guy yuppie diet,"Well, I did buy this book and read it thoroughly. I really was not that impressed with it. Unfortunatly it reminded me of why i stopped reading Men's Health magazine. That is, it works way to hard at capturing masculinity through looks and physical strength. Its pretty shallow stuff.The work out is a good one. But the diet is fairly hard to deal with. Its not the food choices. Those are fine. ITS THE FACT THAT THE WEEKLY MENU COSTS AN ARM AND A LEG! This is a diet for rich guys or yuppie editor/writers who can write it off as a work expense.Blue collar joes with low incomes need not attempt this diet. You'd end up spending a fortune on it in the nine weeks they give you and then what happens when you come to the end of the nine weeks and have to maintain it for life? who the heck can buy the amounts of food they require and the brand names they require! not me."
1,Still left with question,"The author states that no trick photography was used to produce the before and after photographs. I am not convinced. I am not saying the photographs were altered in any way, but I am saying that the photographs are not apples to apples comparisons. The before photographs are small frontal view pictures. The after photographs are almost twice the size and show each man from a different angle. The first photograph shows a man with his arms over his head, another man is wearing all black clothing, and yet another is holding a wieght in his hand. I am not impressed with these photographs. I also noticed that sixteen men took the challenge but fewer than half of the men are photographed. I also do not understand how you can inlude testosterone in the title and not test for the hormone in these individuals. I am left with many questions and am not convinced this plan works."
4,The Testosterone Advantage Plan really works,"The book has changed my life. I am eating much more healthy and more often. I have been on the diet and excercise for 3 weeks now. I have lost 10 lbs and have gained muscle, along with testosterone. I would recommend it to everyone."
2,"Too much hype, not enough science","OK, so its not all bad ... its got some good information. HOWEVER, the book *itself* says in an early sidebar that they ""did not measure testosterone levels"" when they did their own studies (yes! it says it in the book!), but are relying on other studies to back up their claim that this combination diet/fitness regimen will actually alter your testosterone levels and therefore improve your life. Maybe. How can they credibly claim to be a program for ""Testosterone Advantage"" if testosterone was NEVER MEASURED?If you want real science and real studies to back up his claims, read the Zone books by Barry Sears."
5,Best overall nutrition and fitness book I have read,"The authors do an excellent job cutting through the hype of low-fat and zero-carb diets. They concentrate on an appropriate diet consisting of a healthy level of fats, carbs, and protein. Supplements are also thoroughly critiqued. All of the nutritional advice in this book is soundly based in good science. Additionally, the fitness plans are comprehensive, covering both beginner and advanced weightlifting. If you buy only one fitness book, this should be it."
3,Good for novices and intermediates,"I have been training for about 8 years now, and was simply looking for a change, all in one package (with the workout, diet, whole 9-yards). This book provides that package. I believe it's easy to follow, and realistic.The major drawback is for someone like myself, who has a great deal of experience with weight training. Although it's comprehensive, it's a bit too basic IF you are a seasoned lifter - if you are a novice or intermediate lifter, I highly recommend this book."
5,Earth Icons of the Faery Faith,"Fred Adams' beautiful vision of Gaia, the earth Goddess, going through the year, expressed allegorically. Fred shows Earth as alive, growing and changing as the year passes. Through images of each season Gaia is born, grows up, takes a lover, is impregnated, and in Winter, rests while she grows the new year in her belly. These are like Tarot cards; you can meditate on them and find more and deeper layers of meaning. Lovely edition, each image is suitable for framing separately."
1,"I agree, this book is lame",That was good advice to check out this book in a bookstore first. This book is pretty bad. Lucky I didn't actually plop down my dough to buy it here just coz those other fanboys are pushing it.
5,Ten Summoners Tales/Sting VHS,"One of Stings best albums put on video. Great music but not muchgoing on except 24hrs of taping and recording this album at Stings home near Wiltshire {Lakehouse} in England. The musicians are some of the best in the business, Dominic Miller,who is a wizard on the guitar shows some lightheartedness.Maybe a little subdued for Rockers but all in all a must seefor die hard Sting fans and the music is some of the best songsSting has written, including Fields Of Gold, Shape of My Heart,and Probably Me."
3,"Horrible editing and camera work, lip sync too.","I LOVE classic Sting - especially back in these days when he and Vinnie still worked together (Mercury Falling was the last good album). Anyway, the songs are, or course well written, well performed, well recorded, well mixed and well mastered. The video editing is loathsome, disgusting, and frustrating at best. Especially if one has ANY interest in seeing the musicians PLAYING THEIR INSTRUMENTS!!! Mostly you see Sting's face. The seconds you can catch are worth the price."
4,I feel free....,"I was kind of new to Chick Corea. After seeing this dvd, I easily became a fan of his. I don't know what kind of jazz he is playing. Free jazz? Or cool jazz? I hope someone can tell me. The important thing is that I could really feel ""free"" when I saw/heard him playing. Particularly, I did enjoy ""Bud Powell"" accompanied(?) by vocal and ""Oblivion"" which features a conversation between drums and piano.This dvd contains two concerts performed in Japan and Germany in 1996. The former was shot in full screen format and the latter in widescreen letterbox(1.85:1). The technical quality is good. The sound(PCM stereo) is a bit weak but clean and clear."
5,You don't have to be a butler to love this book!,"I am NOT a butler, but I sought this book out on the internet and finally purchased it after thinking I could use it for many years. I was NOT disappointed. It is the best self-help book on the market! This book can help you organize your life on nearly every level. It is an organizers dream book for most of us who have to live without at butler. Yes, I am still in the process of becoming a good household manager, but now I have the advice and skills of my ""guide book man""."
5,Simply The Best!,"If you are involved in the world of private service, I highly recommend this book as a ""must have."" Mr. Ferry has gone to great lengths to get it right and the results are contained within the pages of this book.Mr. Ferry presents us with a history of Butling (and other private service household positions,) and weaves a rich tapestry of service standards, duties, do's and don'ts, professional expectations and numerous other pieces of valuable advice throughout the book.If you do not have this wonderful resource in your collection my advice is to get it and use it.""The British Butler""North Carolina, USA"
5,Butlers & Household Managers,"""I just finished reading your book Butlers & Household Managers and found it extremely interesting and very informative. What a wealth of information...you can use this book if you want to become a Butler or just help organize your own home. I will be going out either tonight or tomorrow to purchase 'Hotel Butlers, The Great Service Differentiators.' I just had my second interview for a position as Butler with The Resort at Pelican Hill in Newport Beach. I thought the interview went well. Im excited about the opportunity of working at such a prestigious resort and I hope to be brought back soon for my third interview. Im looking forward to reading 'Hotel Butlers, The Great Service Differentiators' very much and Im sure I will go though your book many times and keep it as a valued reference. Again, I just want to thank you for a great resourcethat I will use for many years."" M.E."
4,One of My Favorite Christmas Recordings!,"There will probably be many who would not even consider auditioning such a recording, thinking that it must be some sort of slapdash novelty production hastened to market in time for Christmas, but let me assure you that this is an excellent production, with serious musicians seriously recorded, informative liner notes, and a wonderful sense of joy that is perfectly appropriate for the holiday season. There are Christmas songs both sacred and secular, recorded by a variety of guitarists skillful in the slack-key style. Most of the cuts are instrumental, but there are a few vocals, and even these are enjoyable. If you are looking for something a little different in the way of Christmas music, Hawaiian Slack Key Christmas may be just the CD to brighten up your home for the holidays."
2,Don't waste your money.,"As a person who has well over 50 Christmas CDs, this CD is terrible. It dampens the holiday spirits. What a waste of my money. It will be donated to charity."
3,One honest version,"There are things that I love in this version. The singers that aren't stars , are precise , and the tempi are in general very good (exception for the masks trio, too fast). The problem with this recording is that they play the original version, without two treasures that Mozart wrote for Vienna : Dalla sua pace ( aria by Don Ottavio) and Mi tradi quell'alma ingrata ( aria by Elvira)."
1,Very Bad Documentary,"Another bad documentary. Good mafia documentaries are rare. This one is just another one with the usual rehashed scenes and photographs. On top of that, there are historical errors. It goes so far as to say that Joe Adonis (Joe Doto) was not Italian (he immigrated from Italy) and that Crazy Joe Gallo was a member of the Gambino family (he really was part of the Colombo family). It seems like this documentary was put together in a hurry just to reap a buck. It totally neglected to compose a qualitative, detailed, and informative historical outline of the Mafia."
2,not the princess and pea movie!,"I was looking for the Princess and the Pea Movie- not realizing that there is a difference between the movie and the episodes. SO be careful what you are looking to buy as this is the ""chronicles"" not the movie."
5,Excellent ADD educator,"Excellent discussion of various facets of ADHD, including executive functions, various attention and processing problems and their effects. This is also one of the best books I've seen explaining the physiology of ADD at cellular level, and details on treatment and medication that I haven't found elsewhere. The text is early college level. It's well written and clear, but it's not fluffy light reading."
5,The Unfocused Mind,"This is one of the best books about ADD that I've read. What impresses me the most Dr. Brown's understanding that ADD affects everyone differently and the range of symptoms is extensive. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has either been diagnosed with ADD of ADHD, as well as those who suspect they have this disorder."
5,love these books,I read these as a child now my daughter loves reading them. She is only learning to read but she has loved these books for over a year anyway. Her favorite part is finding the spider/mouse/grasshopper on each page.
5,Another great Little Critters Book!,My daughter loves the Little Critter books and this is another new favorite of hers. They are always such a fun read and she can relate to them. She asks me to read these again and again!
5,Great product.,Vent shade came in with no damage and what was excatly what I ordered.. East to put on and looks great.
2,Is this really all?,"After receiving this camera as a gift, I really attempted to make the best of it. I wasn't too sure about the ""digital zoom"" as the only option (for those of you like me, this means that you can't see the zoomed picture through the viewfinder!), and the limited storage capacity made me even more leary. The kicker was that by the time I finished taking about 10 pictures, the batteries ran out!! I was aware that battery life is an issue for digital cameras (something I think they ALL have to improve upon), but this was ridiculous! So, while Sony has some excellent products available... this is not one of them!! Beware."
1,Terrible Production Major Disappointment,"I ordered both volumes, ""Egypt, Yesterday and Today"" and ""The Holy Land, Yesterday and Today"". Nothing could have ever destroyed the beauty of David Roberts work as this aweful production. Most plates are printed on two opposite pages in such a way that disrupts the sweeping landscape effect intended by Roberts. A third grade student could have seen that printing the book sideways in a landscape fashion would have allowed each plate to be reproduced on one page as in integral display exactly the way that Roberts intended it to be, with the text recent photograph on the opposite page.It is fascinating how stupidity and terrible production can destroy magnificent artwork."
5,A superb faery tale full of charm and warmth,"An excellent story of the life of a hob (or brownie, to those more familiar with Dungeons & Dragons) in a 17th century English manor house who adopts a new family and protects them from various exotic and mundane threats. Briggs does a superb job of illustrating a wide range of English folklore and faerie legends without being didactic and presents all the human protagonists in a very real and engaging fashion. The book is peppered with clever poems, old sayings and other cultural tidbits and provides a fun adventure to boot. Briggs was one of the top scholars in her field (English folklore) and managed to carve this gem of a book after writing the definitive encyclopedia of her specialty. Should be read by all enthusiasts of faerie-dom."
3,Folder labels,"I really like these labels, I just wish they came in other colors whether on a separate roll or an assorted color roll."
3,"Decent intro, elementary style","Lots of whitespace in this basic intro to commercial RE investing. Am I glad I read it? Yes. Is it the best basic comm'l RE book? I hope not...although the author covers some of the fundamentals, there was not sufficient detail to make me feel like I knew what was going on.I like the author's premise...build a network, become an expert in your area, take your time...much better than the ""flip it"" mentality. I believe this guy genuinely knows what he's talking about, and sets reader expectations accordingly.It's written in a conversational style, which I liked, but includes a lot of whitespace (skipped paragraphs, skinny margins) which makes this 272 page book really more like 100pp.Bottom line: Good intro, but not great. Worth the low Amazon price."
3,Commercial Real Estate 101,Good introduction for a novice. Not a must if you have any business background.
4,Great 1st time book but too basic,"Its a great 1st timer book, i bought it because i was a 1st timer. but after reading through half of it it seemed like most of it was a lot of repetitive information that i didn't really need. i would recommended it to 1st timers only."
1,Don't Buy This Book!!!!!!!!!,"Before I bought this book I was looking for a smart way to invest in real estate and decided to buy the book because of its high rating. Bad choice! Never buy a book in Amazon just because of the good rating. I've been investing in real estate for 2 years and wanted to expand my knowledge in the field with the help of this book. Bad choice! The 12 easy steps the author is referring to are useless. You are better off learning by experience. I thought the book was ""ELEMENTARY"" with the oversized fonts and childish graphics. I felt like a kid reading a night time story. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK, it is an absolute waste of time. You are better off keeping an eye on the current market situation and make your moves by experience."
4,Excellent Brazillian hardbop,Alosio Aguilar is new to me but it is in notes he has been playing since the 60's (cover photo of him is with Claudio in 1962 as kids-quite frankly I didn't know if it was going to be Tango's or like and Oscar Aleman outing to be honest).Aguilars playing reminds me quite a bit of Harold Mabern and McCoy Tyner.Portohino on drums and now the well known Nlson Mattta (or Trio De Paz fame the hottest Brazilian group now on the scene..Most are originals of Aguilar and are very well written and executed.Claudio Roditi is in fine form as usual.The date on this recording is 1992 and it's an excellent outing.Go for a song (or cheap I sang to nobody) here on Amazon.I am going to puruse hs two other recordings as this was a great find.Don't expect Tico Ticoas his tilts wonerfully broderless post bop plying by all.If you want a trio and trio plus trumpet recoding with great chops buy this.PeaceChazz
2,Disappointing,"There is some pretty photography here, and the portraits of the relationships between the Medicis and their artist proteges are engaging. But I must agree with other reviewers that there is a woeful lack of true biographical material about the Medicis themselves. Why were they hated? What were the feuds about? Why did they have to leave Florence? How do they compare to the Borgias? The explanations are vague or absent. I suspect that what we have is a chamber of commerce history, with sumptuous sets and costumes and heavily accented narration, designed to make you want to visit Florence, but with very little elucidation and no insight. I think you can get a better perspective on Renaissance Italy from Hollywood's historical fiction The Prince of Foxes, starring Tyrone Power, than with this documentary."
4,Enjoy it for fun or education,"Have you ever watched a movie that made you anticipate the next scene so much it gave you goose bumps? This is just that sort of movie. It is fast paced, exciting, historically accurate, fun, and educational.The Medici were among the ruling families in Florence, Italy during the Renaissance era. The ruling families made their own laws and everything, including murder, was legal. Learn how the Medici's rose to the prominence of the most powerful positions in Florence, while Brunelleschi created the dome for the Florence Cathedral.As an art historian I am always interested in DVDs to show my students. Many are not worth the time and money but this one definately is. It is one of the best I have seen."
4,Great documentary about medici family,"This DVD series consists of 4 episodes lasting a total of 220 minutes. It describes the rise of the Medici family from the founder, Giovanni de'Medici (aka di Bicci), to Fernando II, grand duke of Tuscany. Dramatised scenes and interviews with historians give a very good insight into histrory of the family and the important role they played in the Renaissance. I was so enthusiastic, I bought a second one as present to my father."
5,"""Till Morning's Light "" by Monica Hatch","I have enjoyed listening to Monica's newest release ""Till Morning's Light"" which has just become available.The collection of soothing lullabies and quiet songs is sensitively sung. There are several a capella Gregorian chants that are beautifully rendered and contribute to this exceptional CD. Recommended!"
4,10 Minute Retriever,"I was pleased with the book until I realized that one chapter was missing. I ordered a second one and had the same problem. I also had to take the time to return the first one and kept the second one, which is still missing a chapter. Perhaps your books should be scanned after printing to avoid misprints being mailed out."
2,the 10 minute retriever,This book was not in the condition promised. It had corners folded back and there are markings and notes throughout the book. VERY disappointing!
5,AMAZING TRAINING BOOK!!!!,"I highly recommend this book as it breaks the training down to what is most successfully. 10 minutes a day is one of the best ways to train a dog, especially for retrieving. I enjoyed how this book was broken up with true stories about the authors experience with their own dogs and it brought a lot of life into the reading of this book. The photos and diagrams were very helpful as well. I have thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and I would recommend it to anyone working on training any type of dog for retrieving."
4,great book for the 1st time trainer,"I just read the 10 Minute Retriever by John and Amy Dahl and found it to be very informative and educational especially for the 1st time retriever trainer, it gives in depth detail on obedience, force fetch, marking, and it gets the novice handler ready to teach hand signals, and that is the only draw back in the whole book. It also gives a recollection of dogs they have trained in the past. good easy to understand reading."
2,Good = Mediocre,"Cute story. It amazes me that sellers sell a new or ""like new"" copy of the book for $99 and up! Our copy, like others reviewed did not include the plush spider which is why I selected a ""good"" used version. Should have been advertised as missing this or in fair condition, also looked like something had been spilled on the cover. Won't buy from Jenson Online again!"
2,Missing the spider toy!!!!,"This book was supposed to come with a plush spider toy attached to the cover. The seller lists this in very good condition and that is not true considering the toy was missing. Shame on you seller! You need to list ""Spider toy not included"" and drop the price."
3,This is a mono recording set,This recording is not in stereo and is in mono and was not mentioned in the product description.
3,Jbra BT800,Prior to purchasing the jabra BT800 I had no exsperiance with blue tooth headphones. I vetted the product by searching & viewing all reviews I could find on the web. All reviews rated it highly. I have found the product to not perform as exspected as to the ability of others to clearly hear what I am saying. I am told by those at the receiving end of my call that it is aggravating to listen for any length of time because of the poor voice quality. I was led to believe that this product would produce good voice transmition even if there was some back ground noise. I now know that this is not true.
2,Jabra BT800 a disappointment,"I ordered the Jabra BT800 specifically because it advertises a dedicated mute button. The mute button on the first unit I received broke after a few uses. They did replace it promptly. However, I can't get the mute button on the second unit to work - I'll keep trying, but it is alluding me. Also, the headset is not near as comfortable to wear as others I've had."
2,Jabra too heavy,"I purchased this product and used it for 3 weeks before returning it. I have a motorola v710 phone and the headset just did not work very well. Although it was nice to have the caller id on the unit, it did not make up for the other issue it had.1) Too Heavy and swings from the ear as you move your head.2) It would not automatically connect to my Motorola phone. I had manually reconnect up all the time. My new Motorola BTHS10will allow me to shut off from the headset and it disconnects from the phone. When I open the boom on the headset it will just auto connect to the phone without doing anything.3) Many times I never could get the voice response to work. Even though I could see the commands working on the phone the voice commands could not be heard on the headset."
2,Not all that,"I have received the Jabra T500 and it is incredibly bulky, hard to even get on your ear and te sound quality is awful. Everyone I speak to wnas to know why I sound like I am in a tin can. The only thing good about this unit is the call list and the vibrate function. I would not recommend this product."
2,"Great gadget appeal, so-so quality.","I replaced my BT 250 with this, and although it is a cool gadget, the sound quality and volume leaves much to be desired. Also, the headset does not sit tightly on my ear -- kinda flops around when I move my head. If it had a gel like the 250, this would rock, but I simply cannot hear whoever I am talking to in any but the quietest conditions. Time for me to start looking for an alternative."
2,Another bad purchase,"Not loud enough. Short battery life, and poor ear canal/opening fit.USB power adapter/charger was also poorly designed and electrical plug conductors failed. Destined for 3rd world country ""rebuy""."
2,Heavy and Bulky,This thing is awckward and very uncomfortable. The caller ID display is cool. But that's it.
4,Great product,The Jabra BT800 is a good Bluetooth headphone that could be used with a few systems (I use it with my 2 cell phones (Palm 650 & Motorola L6) and 2 computers = 4 systems). It is very easy to move from one system to another.The sound quality is good for both sides.The system is a bit heavy and with glasses it is a bit uncomfortable
3,Good Headset; But Lacking a Few Things,"I bought and returned this. It was heavy and I could not wear it for a long time. The pairing process with my LG PM-325 was long and I had to call Jabra to get it completed. The caller ID is a great concept by not very functional since you can not look at it while you are wearing the head set. This is good for someone who does not talk for a long time and does not want to keep the headset on between calls. The ""Noise-Cancelling"" is not worth it.I ended up buying a Jabra FreeSpeak 250 and I am much happier. It is great to wear all day."
2,Jabra bt800,"Too bulky and does not hang on your ear securely. Sales pitch said it has caller id, but all it has is a read out on the head set that can not be seen while wearing it."
2,VERY unconfortable and muffled sound,"After many, many complaints about the sound quality on my Jabra 250 (esp. in car), I bought the BT800.The features like ring tones. menu, etc are all very nice, but the basic needs need to be met first.Comfort (or, rather lack of)It is all solid plastic (no flexibilty anywhere) and is thus really uncomfortable. I could barely wear it for more than an hour. I'm sure I could have got used to it, but the big problem was the sound.Sound QualityPeople I regularly spoke to on my cell phone said it was ""different"" in comparison to BT250. Not one person said it was ""better"" or ""clearer"" and some people said I sounded ""muffled"".Bottom LineI returned it and got the Gennum nxZen Plus. It cost 50% more, but the sound seems to be a lot better. It's very comfortable to wear: it has two different size ear hooks and 4 ear plugs that go in the ear (like the 250). I'm having problems getting the equalizer software to work, but so far (a few days), I'm happy."
2,A bad fit...,"The overall features of this product seemed to be just what I was looking for, however, features aside, the unit was a bad fit for me. I was unable to hear beacuse the earpiece would not fit in, or stay in my ear."
2,"this is not the driod you're looking for, move along...","seriously, this thing is barely usable. heavy, (and the picture when i bought it showed a much sleeker design.) battery life is unacceptable; barley a day IF you don't actually use it. and the cool led screen? why? it's stuck in your friggen ear already, i have yet to find someone that can read the screen and use the thing at the same time... although it does make it easier than most to sync up. whatever, it could take three days to sync up (i have to do THAT once.) i have to actually USE it all the other time."
2,"Dull Movie, Poor Audio","""Are You There?"" had a dull lifeless feel and audio problems. The story focuses on a nursing home in England that is located on the cold windy English Coast. A 10-year old boy named ""Edward"" (Bill Milner) is lonely. He is an only child that helps his parents with chores and the residents. He is obsessed with death and dying and his thoughts have begun to govern his quality of life. His parents are stressed, and he has given up his bedroom to live in what looks like a large closet. Soon a retired Magician named Clarence (Michael Caine) moves in and after a rough start, they develop a friendship based on magic and debating what happens after death.Soon Clarence's influence helps everyone look at the sunny side of life.Although the plot sounds interesting, the script does not move well, and the inability to understand some of the words does not help."
2,Very dry,"This movie was very dry, boring and really didn't make it's point - to be part of the living before it was too late. I love Michael Caine, but with his talent, he could have done this movie asleep. Or maybe he did."
2,This movie is the cure for insomnia . . .,"I would have given it only one star, except for Michael Caine's acting ability. The movie was a depressing and boring experience. Attention magicians and magic enthusiasts . . . it ain't there."
5,Good Movie,This was a touching story and Michael Caine did a superb acting job. Finally a movie everyone can watch.
2,Not even the great Michael Caine saves this movie,"Even though starred by the great Michael Caine, as a retired magician who becomes the best friend of the ten year old son of a married couple who owns the retirement-home where the old man is sent to live, this film never gets its point.A totally forgettable movie."
5,Incredible film and a must see,"I highly recommend this film, beautifully acted by Michael Caine! I think it is one of his best roles ever, bringing honesty and a real sense of what aging means and how people get old and cope, and how regrets become a part of the emotional landscape of people as they do so. I am glad I now have a copy of this film to wathc and share with others as I get tolder. it gives a sense of being understood to whoever wathces it and it also serves as fine story for people of all ages, too!"
2,Unintelligble,I'm Sure I would have enjoyed this movie and rated much higher if I could have understood the dialog. There was only Spanish subtitles which didn't help me. Caine's voice was often too soft which added to the problem.By the way I am a big Michael Caine fan
1,BORING,"This book was borring... I knew what was going to happen, the characters sucked. if you want a real book read some Elizabeth Chandler books like At first sight, I do now those are books I like!!!"
4,Radiohead?,I think this whole album is great. Although.... I listened to it in search of the Piano version of a Radiohead song I heard in the movie. It is a song from Radiohead's OK COMPUTER. I am unable to find it on this soundtrack and I REALLY LOVED IT! I'm hoping I overlooked it and someone can tell me what # is is or where to find it. jhenmiller@gmail.com THANKS
4,One other song missing,"Nice soundtrack, but yet again one superb music is missing: Brad Mehldau's piano version for Radiohead's Exit Music For A Film. OK, how could it be left out?"
2,i know which song you are looking for!!,"the name is Nara by E S Posthumus, you can look because that ONE song is that...."
4,Third Miracle???,"It's hard to believe that the people who loved Bliss and Unfaithful have not heard the Third Miracle. It is without a doubt one of the best soundtracks around. So eclectic. Lush strings, magnificent, pulsing, ethnic tracks. A great treat and certainly Kaczmarek's best!!! The Third Miracle is such a potpurri of musical genres that it is puzzling that Ali Farka Toure's music is not included in the Unfaithful soundtrack. However, this newest effort is lovely and well-worth having."
1,Unfaithful,I also was disappointed in the omittance of the jazzy/arabic music. That was the whole reason that I purchased it. I would also like to know if anyone does know who the artist is. ...
3,help,"i've read just about every review posted and i am still confused about the song i am looking for. to be very specific, i would like to know the name of the song that is played in the trailer on the ""unfaithful"" dvd. i am not sure if it is the same trailer as the one played on hbo. any information on this would be very much appreciated."
5,Great piano theme soundtrack,This score is great to listen to while eating dinner with that special someone. The melodies are soothing yet at times somewhat eerie. Although the music goes great with the film it really stands alone well aslo. Kaczmarek looks to be an up and coming composer so to get his breakthrough work is essential.
3,Think I Found the Song from the Train Scene,"Everyone seems to want to find out the name of the song in Unfaithful when Constance is on the train, reflecting on her recent liason with the frenchman. It's not Moby's ""Porcelain"".I found a variation of the song you hear. Covered by Diane Arkenstone in the album Jewel In The Sun. The song title is ""Ethereal Rain"". Amazon doesn't provide a sample of the song, but if you do a search under Yahoo shopping, they provide a sample.As for the rest of the CD, it is the typical orchastra score, which does provide a lot of feeling into the movie."
1,Not what I thought,This Soundtrack is orginal music only. I bought the CD looking for a blues song that was played during a love making scene in the movie. It was not on the soundtrack. I thought that the music on this CD was dull and boring.
1,Don't buy it....,"I didn't buy the CD but one of my friends did and I did listen to it expecting a lot more than I got. If you were looking for the trailer song, it's definitely not on here. It's called ""Nara"" by E.S. Posthumus if anyone wants to know. This CD is a huge let down from the trailer music and is a little too depressing for me. Word of advice...don't waste your time or your money."
2,i know which song you look for!!,"The name is Nara, by E.S. Posthumus, it is beautiful and plays in the trailler from HBO..."
1,This is a rip!,"As with ""The Score"", a movie with incredible smokey jazz performances but a soundtrack to snore by, this rip-off passing for a soundtrack is what we used to call ""bait & switch"" Why call it a soundtrack?? It's missing the cuts that made the film so hot...Ry Cooder & Ali Farka Toure. Not to mention Moby's cut used so effectively in the trailor but ignored otherwise. I'm glad I already owned ""Talkin' Timbuktu"" from many years back, I would be even more disappointed. As it is, I'm just disgusted at the liberal (and misleading) definitions used for ""soundtrack."""
3,in response to the request of the music fan from NY,"i think u've been looking for is a cover of exit music for a film originally by radiohead and in the film performed by Brad Mehldau, a famous jazz piano player. I think this song is on the album the Art of trio, vol. 4. I hope it's the song u were looking for"
3,lust songs not included,"if you are looking for the sexy african blues song heard twice in the movie,(once during foreplay and once during the bathtub scene)it is not included on this soundtrack CD. The tune you want is called 'Al Du' performed by an artist named Ali Farka Toure.It can be found on a CD titled 'Talking Timbuktu' with Ry Cooder and Ali Farka Toure.Other music not included on the soundtrack CD,that you heard during the first lovemaking scene when Diane Lane's stomach is in lusting seizure mode, are 2 tracks by 'Dead Can Dance'from their incredible 'Spiritchaser' CD. The songs are 'Devorzhum'and 'Dedicace Outo'.In my opinion both Talking Timbuktu and Spiritchaser are wonderful CDs. The soundtrack CD for Unfaithful is fine if you are looking for the score written for the movie by Jan A.P. Kaczmarek. Primarily piano and strings. But purchase the other CDs if you are wanting something to dance naked to."
3,Trailer songs here....,"I have to confess that I have not bought this soundtrack but (probably, like most of you) was captivated by the songs played in the trailer. This soundtrack does NOT contain those songs BUT (after some research on the internet) I know where they can be found! If you have also seen the Minority Report and Spider-Man trailers, you have inevitably listened to this particular artist's other works. The group is called E.S. Posthumus and their record is Unearthed. It cannot be purchased anywhere except their website...which is a bit of a tragedy because I'm sure if others knew where this music was coming from this would be a VERY popular album. The specific song in the trailer is called Nara. There is also another song that was featured in the trailer that is not by this group. The song Rushing is by Moby and can be found on his older album entitled Play. I hope this helps other frustrated listeners!"
3,If you are looking for the music from the trailer.....,"I have to confess that I have not bought this soundtrack but (probably, like most of you) was captivated by the songs played in the trailer. This soundtrack does NOT contain those songs BUT (after some research on the internet) I know where they can be found! If you have also seen the Minority Report and Spider-Man trailers, you have inevitably listened to this particular artist's other works. The group is called E.S.

The song Rushing is by Moby and can be found on his older album entitled Play. I hope this helps other frustrated listeners!"
3,What's ALSO missing...,"Not only are the songs by E.S. Posthumus, Farka Toure, and Moby missing, but also a brilliant piano version of Radiohead's ""Exit Music (for a film)"" played by Brad Mehldau."
2,Read before you buy....,Please note that this soundtrack does NOT include all those nice jazzy pieces that were in the movie. This soundtrack is merely the score and is all instrumental. It is an okay cd if your are looking for some haunting music....
3,Great piano variation,"Get this for that track alone, it makes you remember the pain from the movie. I also was hoping to hear Nara on this CD, but it is not here. If it was, this would be a 5-star album."
2,Please help!,"I'm looking for the *orchestral* music in the trailer - that building, rising, dramatic music: ""Duh-duh, duh-duh, duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-DUH!"" (They also play it in a trailer on HBO.) Can anybody *please* help me identify this music?"
1,Defective?,"Could not get it to work. Documentation & manufacturer online support poor. Returned it, will look for another device. Ignore the single star rating as I could not submit a review without it. It deserves zero stars."
5,I love all Ross Thomas books!,What can I say? I love all Ross Thomas books and I ordered these so I would own all he had written.
2,Not very impressed,"We generally buy our picholines out of the barrel at an Italian deli in Madison, WI. Despite high hopes that these might compare, we were somewhat disappointed with the comparative flavor and texture of this product."
4,yowser...,"nice up the beats, crank up the stereo, turn on the hose, open up the doors and dance out to the street. big ragga tunes mixed up with serious beats."
3,not quite hot as some previous Colt efforts,"I was a little bit disappointed with this offering. The models were not as interesting, or as well posed as they have been in previous years. NOT a bad effort mind you - just not as outstanding as we have come to expect from Colt. Not as much variety in the models, not really any Daddy woofs - mostly relatively young, average to above in looks, cut, hairy chested, but a bit vapid looking, and ho-hum. As if most of them were only there for a quick buck and a brewsky."
2,Not so hot this year,"I agree with the other reviewer, hair a bit too clipped, & poses a little silly in some cases. I buy the Colt Hairy Chested Men calendar every year & this year is definitely not up to the usual standard. HOWEVER, that is not my issue. I actually DO frequently refer to a calendar while sitting at my desk. For some strange reason the numbers on the calendar have been printed in watermark form so it is virtually unreadable if you are more than a foot away! So as a calendar, this is useless."
4,just one quibble,"This was a fairly good book of its type, I enjoy these kind of stories. However I have a quibble with the subtitle - ""the Incredible Saga Of A Courageous Couple Who Outwitted Death At Sea For A Longer Period Than Any Humans Before"".There was a sailor during WWII, named Poon Lim, who survived 133 days on a raft. A little research would have dug this fact up, it was a fairly well known story. The Bailey's saga was remarkable enough, it did not have to be falsely billed as the most remarkable ever."
2,mr boe,"While their first album..""hipsway"" was a real supprise, their follow upper is the opposite. The magic moments from their first album...""The broken years, the honey thief, ask the lord"" which sat the standart and made promises for an exciting and awaited 2nd album. Sad to say, their 2nd album....here under the name..""the rest of Hipsway"", is a real disapointment.While their first had quality in all kinds of way, and the aura of magic. This second and last from Hipsway, is a rather sad ending of a band that could, and should go all the way up among the best. The magic is gone, and this one is just another 2nd album flop...........as together with so many other bands that fail to follow up their first.There are of course some moments here.....or mabye i should wish there were some moments here. I loved their first album that was so influenced by the best of british pop, american soul and r'n'b.If i should recomend something here..............buy their first one...Hipsway."
1,DREADFUL WASTE OF TIME,"Once upon a time, women devoured Danielle Steele type novels for summer or beachy reads. Now in the era of chick lit, you see a million sex and the city like Bridget Jones knockoffs, like Girl Anatomy, but this is awful. I was flabberghasted by the few positive reviews. The writing is terrible. the main character dull and self absorbed. I especially take issue with Miss Bloom's dialogue which is horribly written. SO MUCH telling and not showing. And just not distinct voice. HOW DID THIS GET PUBLISHED?Incidentally, I was gifted this by a friend for my birthday and when she read it afterwards, she apologized. I agree with other posters in that you kind of hang out to see if the it'll ever redeem itself, you think it has to, but it never does. yes, the ING thing was very convoluted and made for a confusing, messy read too."
4,Who DOESN'T relate???,"Reading this book was like reading my journal. I couldn't believe how many similarities there were between myself and the heroine, Lilly! The concept of having these dual personalities that have ongoing disputes inside your head about the decisions you make and the way your life should be lead, rang SO true with me! Who doesn't have that adventurous spirit inside you that so often is squelshed by that calm, rational voice of reason? This book is a delightful read. I highly recommend it!"
4,thats my girl,when i picked up this book i expected another sex in the city knockoff (which i cannot get enough of) but to my delight it turned out to be something quite different. the author's take on single life as a young women was both refreshing and entertaining. i have had somewhat similar experiences in my dating career and its nice to know that i'm not alone. way to go girl!
4,I liked this book,"Girl Anatomy was just what i needed. A fun read that made me laugh and smile. With so much craziness around, what with the holidays etc, it was nice to escape a bit. Nothing better than a hot bath and some funny, charming, recognizable fiction. Anyone looking for a terrific first novel should check out this book."
2,"Problems with the book's ""anatomy""","Girl Anatomy is a modern story about a hopeless romantic young woman seeking love in Los Angeles. Having heard about her best friend's pending nuptials, Lilly begins to analyze her past relationships.Despite some witty moments, Girl Anatomy is one of the sloppiest novels I have ever read. I couldn't determine whether the narration was present or past tense -- it goes back and forth. Also, I had a difficult time liking a twenty-four-year-old heroine who addresses men as ""boys."" I sometimes wondered if the novel was about a teenager disguised as an adult.Girl Anatomy has various elements of chick lit: the relationships, parties and witty dialogue between the characters. And the story itself is rather sweet. However, I wish the writing had been more coherent."
3,good book that many can relate to.,"overall, this book was not at all boring. there was always something going on with the main character,lilly, whether she was reminicsing about ex lovers or impulse shopping out of unhappiness. interesting book, said a lot of things that made sense that just about any person could relate to when it comes to love.it did have its cheesy moments and a few cliches, but its a solid book and you do see that lilly does mature and grows stronger as it goes on."
2,Alternatingly funny and idiotic,"At 1st I really liked this book. I related to the main character's feelings towards men and love. But then she was smoking pot & talking about how great it felt. She said she thought sex was special, but she went into detail about her 2 one-night stands. While it had it's good moments, the book was basically plotless & talked way too much about drugging & partying, and not enough about how she ""changed"" from the time the book began untill when it finally ended."
2,Summer Song,"""I Think I'm in Love With You"" is one of those songs you're bound to hear blaring from the radios of teens in the summer. It's a fun and catchy tune, but Simpson keeps it from being a pop classic with her endless need to prove she can hit those high notes eardrums be darned. She tends to screech and scream to show off her range to the discomfort of ears around her. The song was bound to be a hit for someone, but maybe someone a little easier on the eardrums."
5,Jessica Simpson,I LOVE this single!!!I hear it when I feeling sad.This song always cheers me up!This is a dance song!!
4,It kept me turning pages,"This would make a great Hollywood formula movie. But despite it's predictability and Hollywood ending, it keeps you guessing, as confused as the heroine is over who to trust and who to believe. A great read for a rainy afternoon like today; even while I was second guessing the characters and waiting for the ending I expected, I couldn't put it down!"
4,Mind Twister,"This book was a mind twister. Very different plot from other thriller's I have read. I have to admit, I felt for Therese, and could not wait to find the outcome for her. It does seem a little unreal how Rebecca came back into Therese's life and virtually took her away from Michael and Devon, in a sense, to easy. The best part of this book is the twisted plot of Michael and Devon. I wish the ending would have went into a little more detail of Therese's new life. Good book overall."
3,Average Book,"House of Many Rooms was definately not the best book ever read. It keeps your attention in some parts and in others you loose interest and want to skim right through (which by the way I did through the last half of the book). It was an ""average"" book in my opinion. I guess I wanted Rebecca and Michael to mend thing, although his character was not such a ""good guy""!"
3,"Great beginning, but fizzles in the end","This is the first book I have read by Gabriel and I picked it up because of the great review Kirkus gave it. The beginning really hooked me and kept me reading until the end, even though I grew more and more disappointed as the book went on. The settings are great and the character of Michael Florio was well-drawn (in fact, the best characterization in the book) but I was annoyed by how much Gabriel gave away halfway through the book. It seemed obvious to me where all the ""secrets"" he reveals were leading, and I was not surprised by the ending. There were too few suspects in Barbara Florio's murder to begin with, so who her killer ends up being is not a shock. Plus I found that I liked the ""bad guy"" more than Rebecca, who I found annoying and pushy. Throwing in her ex-lover at the end was also a turn-off."
3,"Alright, but not earth shatteringly good","`The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter' like `Love Songs from the Man'ysh' has also been illustrated by the highly talented Miyata Masayuki. Though there were not enough pictures in `The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter' which is a pity as it would have been an excellent opportunity for Miyata to display his talent.As for the story itself well, it's certainly different from most fairy tales in that the heroine is in many ways a villain, the only other similar character would be Princess Turandot... Aside from that it is not an especially interesting story."
4,A decent super-cheap recorder!,"You certainly can't beat it for the price! As a musical instrument, the sound is slightly whistle-y and thinner than some more costly recorders, but frankly, not by all THAT much. It does tend to ""buzz"" when it gets too steamy inside, and it's more difficult to clean because it doesn't come apart.This Canto recorder is slightly shorter than my Schylling 3-piece, which can be a slight advantage for players with smaller hands. The fingering is standard and you'll be able to go through any recorder instruction book using this instrument.The colour-coding isn't just cosmetic, either - I bought one for each kid, and one for myself, in different colours, so nobody's swapping spit or fighting over whose is whose (obviously, you can't do that in a large school group). The matching coloured bags are helpful, too - we can see from the outside whose is whose!I'm thrilled to have found these recorders - they are the perfect thing in our homeschool setting and the kids love them."
5,Brilliant Album,"I got into synthpop just a couple of years ago, and Cosmicity was one of the first acts I really explored. The first album I heard was ""Isabella"" and I thought that was amazing. After hearing that album, I wanted to hear more and subsequently tracked down other albums by Cosmicity. I previously thought that Isabella was the best, but then I heard Pure. This album is spectacular. Literally every track is a gem. Mark has always explored a lighter sounding synthpop, but with this album he seems to combine that sound beautifully with some of the most insightful, yet somehow amusing, lyrics I've ever heard. My personal favorite tracks are ""I Want You,"" ""Let Me In,"" ""Escapism,"" and ""I Have Nothing."" I would consider this album a must have for all fans of synthpop."
1,Postal worker is pathetic writer,If 'Reginald Buchanan' is as poor a postal worker as he is a writer then he surely f--- up people's mail. This book seemed interesting but it is dull reading. If the person had some talent such a premise for a novel might be fascinating. But this book leaves me cold. It is self published and I expect that is how it will stay. Don't let postal workers read this stuff. It will drive them postal.
1,a total disapointment,"This is a badly written book on a very macabre subject. The idea that a serial killing postal carrier is killing off his customers is horrific. I lost friends in the Edmond, Oklahoma post office massacre, in the Oklahoma city bombing and in the world trade center. This book with it's pointless gratuitous violence is disturbing and horrific. The book lacks well written characters and has very poor dialogue. I highly recommend you ignore it. 'Reginald Buchanan' is hardly a P.D. James. He is only a wannabe writer."
1,a load of rubbish,I was looking forward to this self published book but it is really poorly written. The violence is over the top and totally out of hand. I would never recommend this book to any of my friends. The writer is clearly getting his balls of with all the sex and violence.
1,blood bath,THE KILLER POSTMAN is a blood bath passing itself off as a book. it is filled with violence and more violence. A good writer would not resort to violence like this unless it was totally necessary. I believe that the so called writer has alot of problems and is putting them into book form. I finished the book but it left me devestated. One star is to much. How about a rating of zero? No stars!
3,"Bold, and Entertaining!!","This novel had some slow parts, just like many of the other novels I've read, but it always kept me wondering who the Killer Postman was. As I read through the novel I tried to pick up some clues, but the author kept mixing in a clue here and a clue there. I think he did a good job by making the reader continue to guess who the killer was. I thought I figured it out about halfway through the novel, but then Ruby came into the picture. Ruby was a transvestite who had some serious issues (murderous issues). There were two killers roaming the streets. This was a good murder mystery mixed in with daily postal workers activities. I enjoyed it."
4,The Killer Postman reviewed by a postman,"I'm a 25 year old man who is a ptf postal carrier. In postal lingo that means part time flexible. I loved this book. I read about it on a messageboard and it is a fun book. Whoever Reginald really is, he or she has captured the world of postal workers perfectly except for the serial killer aspect. Contrary to what some people assume, this book book is not by a disgrunted USPS employee. It is by a very talented author. The book can be quite chilling at times."
1,Simply put...,"This book was just horrible. There were a thousand and one characters introduced, no plot to follow, and it hardly qualifies for a mystery novel. I felt as if I were back in the third grade listening to one of my classmates read his/her book report. [...] One thing is for sure, I would NOT recommend this book to others."
1,Wrong product shipped,"I ordered double density and got high density, which my floppy drive won't use. The picture shows double density which is 360kb and my drive, which is for a recently purchased TRS-80 Color Computer 3, cannot use the 1.2mb high density media."
2,Not as seasons 1 and 2,"Not in spanish language nor spanish subtitles as seasons 1 and 2 do, so it's a stop thing for a lot of people. It must be said before purchasing."
5,Excellent Book!,"Excellent written. This book is not only recommended for Livemotion-users, it`s a must.You know that feeling, sitting in front of a new software and don`t have a clue? Simon Dabkowski takes you by the hand and leeds you the way. Answers and explanations to the point.Worth every cent..."
2,LiveMotion 2: A Beginner's Guide,"Knowing Live Motion 1 very well, I bought this book specifically to learn more about Live Motion 2's new scripting capabilities. I therefore only read the last 5 chapters (11 thru 15) on scripting.My most relevent comment regards typos. That is misspellings of both text and javascript code. So much so that I couldn't beleive it. This publisher ought to be ashamed of themselves. Is there not such a thing as an editor or proof reader anymore?I found these typos on practically every page (chapters 11 thru 15) and especially in the example code, a most frustrating way to learn (the code printed on page was incorrect and therefore the example files did not work).Although there were some well thought out ideas conveyed, because of so many mistakes, I would not recommend this book for beginners."
1,LiveMotion 2,I have never been more disappointed with a computer related book than this one. I found dozens of errors and spent an excessive amount of time trying to get some of the examples to work....with no success.I went to the publisher's website and downloaded the files and found that I could not load a substantial number of them because they were written for LM1.0 and could not be imported into my LM2.0It's embarrassing that the author is continually promoting his book on the web instead of attempting to correct the errors in an erratum to the website. I highly suggest that he update the website files to LM2.0 as promised in the book instead of trying to push a book that contains so many inaccuracies. I also don't understand why a few dollars of royalties would be more important than the author's dignity and professional reputation.Please correct your errors and make your companion website files compatible with LM2.0
1,Dissappointing!,"I purchased this book hoping to learn a little of LM2.I am happy to report that Micro Center was able to refund me! I found the book riddled witherrors. I WOULD NOT recommend it to anyone becauseit is, in my opinion, irresponsible of the author torelease a book with deceiving information, such as:online files that don't exist, illustrations out of place,and examples geared for LM1, NOT LM2.If you're serious about learning LM2, stay away from this one!"
3,Bobble Head: Catwoman (Black Suit),"I just received this item today, but I would have to say that the paint job on this bobble head is not the greatest, a bit cheesy. The picture you see on amazon is slightly different from the actual piece. The base of it is a much lighter gray colour, plus it has a ruby like stone and other props on the base. her goggles are not tinted blue as you see on the amazon picture but clear as it states on the description of this item (read it). Her upper lip is a bit fuller(doesn't look bad though), and her outfit is painted with a shiny black finish and not a matte finish as you see on this site. If the piece had a matte finish then perhaps it would have look much better (my opinion). It also comes holding a black whip. The piece does look better on picture then the actual item. All and all the items does look pretty cool once it is taken out of its packaging."
2,Never thought I'd finish....,"I usually read a book in a few days, but it took me a month to read this one. I did get some good information from Mr. Schiller's book, but I probably could have gotten that little bit from some website in about 30 minutes. It is too full of confusing information that was lost in too many words. Would have been better at half the pages..."
3,COULD'VE BEEN BETTER,"I think the author wrote this book while in a white hot fury. There's nothing wrong with righteous indignation and this case cries out for that but he's so angry that he fails to present his case in a concise, linear way for his readers."
1,Dull-Same old known facts and theories,"I purchased this book as soon as it came out, hardcover, what a waste of money - I usually buy paperbacks. Perfect Town, Perfect Murder is a slow, boring, painful read. The reader can find more interesting information by simply surfing the net. An author of his caliber should not have wasted his time or mine."
2,"Poorly written; the word ""that"" used ad nauseum","Coming from a Dershowitz book, this book was hard NOT to put down"
4,Excellent true crime reading.,"Off-and-on a huge true crime fan, I found this book to be great reading, particularly since the case is so much in the media and on my mind. Probably the most important facet of this book that makes it great reading is that unlike many true crime reads, the author is exceptionally literate. Though he occasionally gets bogged-down in obsessive detail, I found this to be one of the most compelling true crime books I've read. The difficulty in this book lies in its ending: Suddenly, sort of without warning, BOOM, it's the end of the book.....and the ending whimpers a little, rather than crashing. And, of course, since this case has yet to come to any resolution, the reader is left with that same sense of dissatisfaction that the investigators must feel. Still, it's a powerful book, and, I think, is without bias, which would be a difficult task for most authors to accomplish."
1,Amazingly dull for a story embraced by every tabloid,"It was nearly impossible not to get bogged down in the details in this book. The author really is not putting forth a thesis at all as to who did this murder. He is merely providing all of the infinite details of an investigation that really led nowhere. If you think you would enjoy reading 300 pages about the uncooperative behavior between the DA's office and the police, then you might think this is ok."
1,"Well-researched, but, dull, dull, dull","I read a lot of true-crime stories. Perfect Murder Perfect Town was a great disappointment. The author's research was impressive, but his storyline, and style need a lot of help. The book is a jumble of characters that continually pop in and out without a proper lead-in. I also found this book provided no new facts about the JonBenet murder. The story is very slow, very difficult to follow, and will test even the most avid reader's concentration. Sorry Lawrence Schiller, take some time off and try again!"
4,Detailed for the wannabe Crime Investigator,"I have always been interested in unsolved mysteries. I already knew the Jonbenet Ramsey story and had seen many of the specials on TV. I think it's important to note this because if you are not that type of person you may find this book to be too detailed. If you are the type of person who likes to play the sleuth, you will ""enjoy"" (to the extent one can enjoy a tragedy) this book. Many, many, facts and details are presented in the book from multiple angles. The book delves deeper than most of the fluff pieces present on TV. Because of all the details, the book gives you the opportunity to take all the information presented and make your own judgements on this tragic mystery."
5,"Perfect Murder, Perfect Town is A+",Lawrence clearly explains why the grand jury reached the decision of not indicting anyone. His book is clearly the best on the case. Everyone who is interested in this case should read it.
3,VERY DEEP,"This book, to put it bluntly, is too detailed. I have to admire Schiller's research and the time it must have taken him to do such a work, but it is too much for your average reader. I picked this book up looking for a reconstruction of the case and the evidence found. What I got was a tragic murder and every possible sidebar you can imagine. The information was compiled in a very organized manner, but with all the information and people mentioned, I found myself flipping backward very often. Due to this and the fact I began reading other books silmultaneously, I will not finish the book. The information was too extensive to just pick up where your left off. This is for someone who has enough time to read and comprehend every detail."
1,"Boring, Boring,Boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","I usually love true crime, This book shed no light on who may or may not have murdered this precious child. I could have taken every newspaper clipping on the crime and written it myself. Wasted my money BIGTIME!!!!"
1,Schiller Is a Sloppy Writer and Not Factually Accurate,"Although a reasonably well-written book, Schiller's work is sloppy, and not as factually comprehensive as he would have the reader believe. For example, Schiller is strangely silent about the lawsuit brought against Alex Hunter by New York attorney Darnay Hoffman in November 1997. It was front page news nationally for weeks. A shocking oversight for a ""careful"" researcher, who should know better. It ruined the book for me, knowing he had missed this incident. What else has he left out?"
1,THIS IS A LOUSY BOOK !,"This is unquestionably the worst true crime book this reviewer has ever read. I can only surmise that the author was paid by the word. Silly, irrelevant quotes from persons who had no reason to be interviewed. To compare this book to ""In Cold Blood"" is an insult to Truman Capote."
1,Boring. Confusing. Extraneous details. No revelations.,"Having just read Jeffrey Toobin's book about the OJ Simpson case, I was looking forward to an enlightening book about the JonBinet Ramsey case. The book jacket promised big revelations.I ploughed through countless chapters. There were long quotes from people who I didn't have an idea who they were and why they were quoted. There were countless newspaper articles and other boring stuff about the police and the DA's office.I wanted the author to make the Ramseys ""real"" to me. I wanted to know what they were like. Nothing in the book gave me a sense that these people could actually beat and strangle their daughter to death. I am left with confusion about the murder and, moreover, confusion about the reason for this book.I didn't learn anything new."
5,This Book Made Me Finally Think!,"I have family, with young ones, from Boulder. They left here one day after Christmas, none of us had watched the news, and they came home to the ""Jon Benet Ramsey""-media extravaganza. I've been to visit them often. Boulder is a beautiful town. Mostly kind people, from the short time I've ever spent there, they are much friendlier than you would think. This book gave me so much information that I was denied. But, I wouldn't care being denied anything, if it served a purpose. To help catch a killer. What I learned in this book is that Detective Scott Thomas of the Boulder Police Dept. had a problem with keeping vital information secret. This book taught me that you should look at every side, no matter what, and maybe there is no answer. At least not now. And it taught me to remember, everyone, is innocent until proven guilty. This Author worked hard. Give him his dues. Excellent reading - stayed up late!"
3,Lots of information but the crucial questions aren't really answered,"I wavered over what rating to give this book. If there was a ""three and a half stars"" option I'd give it that. The book contains lots and lots of detailed information on JonBenet's parents, on the investigation, and how things were handled in Boulder, but at the end of this (very very long) book there still isn't any definitive answer or even a good theory about who killed JonBenet or what really happened. I also think this book could have been a lot tighter - do we really need 800 pages to cover one murder (not multiple murders) that didn't even result in a lengthy court proceeding? Overall the book is interesting at times and a bit of a snoozer at times, and it's hard to separate the details that one really wants to know about the parents' lives and personalities, the other suspects, the murder scene, and so forth from the ""local color."" I expected more from Schiller, frankly."
2,Minutiae,"This book is a lengthy, detailed account of the Ramsey murder investigation.I'm sure it is very well researched, but I do not recommend it, unless a person is extremely interested in this case. Otherwise, it could be considered a bit tedious, overly long, and going into many details that may not be important."
1,"Too long, poorly organized","I am a determined type and almost always finish every book I read, but I couldn't bring myself to finish this one. Schiller throws in every tidbit of information that is even remotely connected to the case and does a poor job of orangizing it. There are parts that are interesting, but I ended up skipping large sections that just got too boring. Don't waste your money on this one."
2,Packed w/ material but needed editing and organization.,"It's hard for me to recall much I read other than material which caught my interest and frustration with the book's layout.The book meanders all over the proverbial map without going anywhere--he tries to include all, remain objective, and ends up being a poor read."
4,"perfect murder, pefect town","This is an incridable book. I would have to give it four stars. Even though it is a terrable thing for what happened to JoBennet, how the police worked on her investagation to try and find out who had murdered her. The author did a great job of explaining how everthing went and how it all worked out to be a perfect murder, in a perfect town. I believe that after everything I've heard and read about this book that JoBennet's mother murdered her own daughter. It's sad but that's what I believe to be the truth."
1,A very slow moving nothing new and boring book,This book has nothing new to tell us. The author spent a lot of time telling us the same old story.
1,"Perfect Murder, Perfect Town: The uncensored Story",This is by far the worst book I have almost read. When I say almost it is because I cannot turn another page. It is so boring and drags on and on for hours!
3,"Half, not Step!","The author of this book refers to JonBenet's siblings from her father's 1st marriage as ""step-sisters."" and ""step-brother."" when in fact they were her HALF sisters and brother."
2,"Mostly boring, difficult to read.","The politics of Boulder do not interest me, nor do the lives of the investigators involved in the murder case. Trying to separate the numerous detectives, lawyers, politicians, friends, relatives, neighbors, etc., and the countinous infighting among the characters was very frustrating. It started with unanswered questions and ended with more unanswered questions and more speculations about the case."
3,"Too Much In-House Fighting, Not Enough Case","Like Schiller's book ""American Tragedy"" which was about the O.J. Simpson case, the first 1/3 of this book was hard to put down until it stopped talking about the actual case. The book went into a long (and eventually boring) story about the politics and backstabbing within the Boulder police department and the fighting between the Boulder police and the D.A.'s office. Many names were mentioned, and despite the fact that in the back of the book Schiller has a complete listing of who all the people are, it got tiring to keep looking them up, and like ""American Tragedy"" I gave up and skipped to the end where the case picks up again.Schiller is an excellent writer, he just needs an editor."
3,Three Times Too Long !,"An interesting summary of the case , but far too long. Too much emphasis on the bickering between prosecutors and detectives. Too much detail on the media role. Worth reading if you're interested in the case, but skim the irrelevant parts. Looks like, short of a confession, this one is unsolvable. Too bad."
2,"Too much murder, not enough town","It reads like a vast collection of newspaper articles, which isn't such a bad thing if you just want a broad overview of the case. To live up to his title, Schiller could have beefed up the 'town' component of the book. Apart from a token introduction that runs through your standard Boulder stereotypes, some namedropping of places like Mike's Camera and maybe some implications about Boulder because of some of the cops' attitudes, the book really doesn't say much about Boulder at all. In the end, I did develop a pretty good theory about the murder, and I don't necessarily feel as though I was led there by the author--though he does hit you over the head a bit with his own ideas."
2,Not worth the effort - book could have been 1/2 as long.,You have to plough through lots of unnecessary and BORING passages to get to the 'good' parts where relevant information is revealed. Save your money and skip this one.
2,LONG slow painfully dull,"Large chunks of this book can be skipped. 621 pages with a huge cast of characters that are difficult at times to follow, and when you think you've got the players figured out you realize you don't care. I saw the audiobook is ""abridged"" and for the first time in my life I wished I could hear, if for nothing else, to get the book over with"
3,"Too much enhancement, disassembled facts","The things I am looking for in the JonBenet case are the facts, so that I can reach my own conclusions. Schiller includes all kinds of relatively irrelevent information that makes getting to the truth a painstaking process. Give me the facts, just the facts."
4,"Perfect Murder, Perfect Town","This is an incredable book. I would have to give it four stars. Even though it is a terrable thing for what happened to JoBennet, how the police worked on her investigation to try and find out who had murdered her. The author did a great job of explaining how everything went on and how it all worked out to be a perfect murder in a perfect town. I believe that after everthing I've heard and read about this book that JoBennet's mother murdered her own daughter. It's sad but thats what I believe to be the truth."
2,A review for those who don't know about this crime,"This review is written for people coming 'cold' to this issue - from a place (as I am) where it barely rated a mention and received very little coverage.If you want to know EVERY detail, EVERY nuance, EVERY theory, in fact everything other than who did it (because no-one does), about the Jon Bennett Ramsay murder, then this encyclopedic tome is for you.However, I found it got very, very tedious and repetitive. I rarely don't finish a book once started, but this one defeated me around page 500!Much of the material is repeated. A 250 page synthesis would perhaps be more relevant to the reader coming new to the subject. I appreciate others with a background in hearing about it may gain more from this book."
3,GOOD BOOK IF YOU ARE OBSESSED WITH THE CASE,I HAD SAW THE MOVIE VERSION OF THIS BOOK ON LIFETIME AND REALLY ENJOYED IT...BUT SOMETHING ABOUT HAVING TO SIT DOWN AND READ THE WHOLE BOOK WITH EVERY SINGLE DETAIL ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WAS KINDA BORING...TOO MANY PAGES TOO MANY DETAILS
2,Just a note,"One item stands out after reading most of this book: Patsy Ramsey and one of her girl friends were fond of teasing John Ramsey for being from the South. The ransom note admonished John Ramsey to use his ""Southern commonsense."" The book explains that John was not from the South."
4,great local band,"these guys have created some tight songs and they play great covers. generally can be seen in northern, mn establishments.there is a rumor they are breaking up....sure hope it is not true.website is www.averagesun.com"
2,"Hit or miss, but mostly miss","I enjoy this product a lot when it is fresh. The problem is that the quality of the product varies and you don't know if you are going to get a box of fresh cuts or stale (hard as rock) pieces. When fresh, i think it is one of the best tasting jerky out there. However, when it is stale and hard, it is not edible. Because of the inconsistency in the quality, I will not be purchasing this product again. Its a shame, but they need to work on quality control."
2,Try before you buy,"I was happy to try a jerky without preservatives for my son, but this is extra extra chewy and my 13 year old won't eat it - he prefers the turkey jerky I make. I was surprised he complained about the flavoring too. Make sure this is what you want before you invest."
4,Pretty good but mixed feelings on this jerky....,"The first bag my hubby and I had was very good. It was big pieces that weren't too tough and I LOVE that this jerky is nitrate free!! The second bag we ate as a snack while driving at night so we didn't see all the peppercorns in the bottom of the bag! What we thought was little pieces of jerky was actually very hot black peppercorns and we didn't have any water to wash it down! Yikes, that was painful :o( There wasn't any in the first bag we ate so I guess we will just have to be more careful in the future since the jerky isn't really uniformly packaged."
5,Best Jerky Ever,"This is hands-down our family's favorite jerky. It is very flavorful and peppery but not hot (original flavor). If you like gooey jerky, you probably won't like this. If you like jerky that doesn't leave your fingers greasy but is a touch on the dry side - try it.I also have to say that I love these small, convenient 1oz single size servings - they are easy to slip into a bag and make a great afternoon snack."
5,GOOD SNACK,This is a good snack in a convenient size to bring with me when I travel and to work. It tastes good and it only 80 calories with a good amount of protein.
2,Doing hard time,"I really like the idea of this all natural jerky,but it's pretty difficult to get past the texture and hardness. The flavor is OK but if you get my meaning, it's hard to get to the flavor when you feel like you're chewing on a piece of *hard* dry leather. I got the box of 1-oz packs and it's pretty consistent among the packs."
1,What Happened???,This review is actually written in Sept of 2011. The original was a glowing review but apparently I'm not allowed to review the same product twice. Really Amazon? This jerky used to be so good and now it's the weirdest ever. The packaging that used to be so easy to open is now impossible without scissors. The jerky itself is like squares of hard rubber that are nearly impossible to chew.I bought my usual boxes of original and teriaki and the flavors were almost identical. After years of being a fan (especially my husband who doesn't eat beef)I'm so disappointed in whoever is responsible for destroying a great product. To whoever designed the new packaging....you need to go back to the drawing board. How about the original? It was perfect on all counts as it was. From 5 stars to 1. Barely.
2,Astronaut Jerky?,"I don't know if this is naturally how turkey jerky comes or if it's just this product, but I've never had jerky this dry in my life. It's like they freeze-dried it or something! Instead of ripping a piece off with your teeth, you shatter it. I realize turkey breast meat has lower fat and a stringier, low-connective-tissue makeup, but this stuff is just not enjoyable to eat. It's too bad, too, because the actual taste is really good--spicy, savory, a hint of sweetness. But jerky should be chewy, not crumbly-hard, and my rating reflects this. Very disappointing."
1,Not Good At All,"The product came just like the description said. The packaging and quantity was fine, but the quality of the jerky was practically inedible. The jerky was so dried! It was a waste of money and no one in my house will eat it."
1,Waste of Money,"Save your money. This is the first dream book I ever bought and I hope all the other books are not like this. It is very vague, horoscopes are actually more insightful. I tried to diagnose some of my dreams and only 1 out of 5 of my dream topics was addressed and that 1 topic did not provide anything useful."
4,The Dream Dictionary explain it all.,"If you are looking for a book to help analyze your dreams and want to know what certain symbols mean, this is the book for you. Great condition and fast shipping. I am verypleased."
1,"humanistic rubbish,","I have many dream books, and all the symbols are based on biblical informaion, the symbols in this book are taken from this persons own mind..... i found it dreadfull, infact misguided nonesense, that give the wrong idea, we have a responsibility to help people with the truth when we help them work out their dreams."
4,bedside dictionary,I use this Dictionary all the time. It is well organized and contains most of the common symbols in dreams. It is the perfect size to slip conveniently into a nightstand drawer.
2,Very Unclear Book and Misses Meaning of Dreams.,In different cultures - dreams are consider prediction of feature events in one's life. This book completely misses that connection. I recommend the author to review eastern dream books (several centuries old) for his next book. However the book is very well organized.
1,Dissappointed,"In searching for a replacement for my other dream book, this one looked promising at first. It is lacking in so many common topics I couldn't believe it. It is also written in so many choppy sentences it was annoying. My search continues for a well organized and complete dream book. This one is going back."
3,somewhat disappointed,I have to say that i was alittle disappointed when i received this book today. It was a great price and shipped very quickly but looks like it has been through a bad dream itself and lost.
3,Not all that,"At first I thought it was a great book, but then as I look up ""eyes"" or another word it will say ""Go to bla bla bla"" and you find yourself playing a game with this book. Purchase another book about dreams, not this one."
3,very general,"though i have found many of the dictionary explanations dead on and provocative, i feel its lacking seemingly obvious topics."
5,Best book on dreams,"This book provides different ways of interpreting different symbols of your dreams. You can choose those fit which makes it highly applicable to me. I have come across books that only give a very definite definition on each symbol, which in my dreams are completely irreverent. I love this book provides space for us to choose."
5,very happy with these books made great Christmas gifts everyone loved them we all wonder about our dreams mean this book answer,these books made great Christmas gifts everyone loved them we all wonder what did that dream mean and this book can give them the answers now. they were reading the books before they finished Christmas with the family. Thank you so much
3,accurate but limited,"Most of the dreams I've looked up made sense to what was going on in my life when I had them. For example, when I was upset with my mom I had a dream that I was in this house with spiders all over the ceiling, walls, and floor. I looked up the word spiders and it said I felt 'caught in' a conflict connected with mother. I only gave this book 3 stars because more than once the contents of my dreams aren't listed in the book. But for the dreams that are found in the book their meanings are pretty accurate."
1,Dream Dictionary,"I hate this book! Everytime I Look up one of my dreams, or symbols in my dreams, they all relate back to sex somehow, or to the penis. And I had oewned this book for a long time. I finally just threw it out after some ridicoulous definition. Do not waste your money."
4,Just about everything on dreams.,"This certainly doesn't miss the prophetic element of dreams, nor the emotional, nor the sexual, nor the spiritual. Even if I don't have a dream to look up, I can pick up Dream Dictionary and just browse. It has so many things in, like OBE's and sleep paralysis and nightmares. I am always discovering new things to learn from."
3,dreamers guide,"my dreams are often off the wall, and this book has many definitions for a lot of the items or actions in my dreams. The only thing i dont like is the way some of the categories are organized. i almost perfer to use the internet dictionaries for dreams."
3,Amazing book!,"It was delivered fast,good packaging, the book itself is great, i just wish it has more words i can look up, but it has help med interpreted alo of my dreams and others, this book is very helpful and worth the price."
3,Ok..... but Not the best :(,The meanings are comprehend-able but some of them don't explain much. I would recommend this book only if you want something cheap and not bad dream dictionary. This book is small but also has small lettering. Some of the Defs. are boring and some are not bad.
1,Not a good book,Thought I would enjoy the book but didn't at all. The book has a lot of detail but nothing specific. Because there is so much detail it's difficult to find your specific dream to analyze. For me this was a useless book.
2,not for me,dont waste your money. there are far better dream books out there. i bought this for my kindle because it looked promising. it lacks the origins of a lot of the definitions which leaves me to question where they came from.
5,Best RPG of all time!!,"This game... to put it simply... is a classic. It has all that great games have to offer; adventure, action, and love. It's true that the graphics aren't all that good. But the storyline completely makes up for that. The character development is one of the best characteristics of this game. And the storyline is pure genius. If you are a true RPG fan. This game is a must."
5,First RPG I ever played,"I had this on the Sega CD Rom and I think that this is one of the best games ever released. If you haven't played it..... GET IT, and if you have, then get it again. Althought the story line in Lunar 2 is better the actually game play is a lot more fun in this one. If you are looking for an RPG to play then this is definetly one that you should try"
4,A great game!,"This is a awsome game! I played the Lunar version on SagaCD and Lunar Bluemoon ,but I do belive I like this version better then the SegaCD's version. For one this one has way more cartoons and voice fetures, and the graphics are a little better. But I would call it a tie betwine this and Lunar bluemoon. I licked the music more on the SegaCD version but this one has pretty cool music too! The graphics are not all that great but the spells and story line are awsome! Not to mension the cartoons thay are pretty entertaining while playing the game. it only took me 34 hours to beat the game ( Not that long in my opinion) but it is a fun game and I highly recommend it!"
2,Disapointment,"FOr anyone who has played the original SegaCd version, we all know this game was entirely a disapointment. The lack of the amazing original soundtrack and the subtle changes in story line ruined this game for me."
3,.........it wase grait but no FF7,shure if u havent had a chance to play its pretty darn good but compair luner to FF7 it dose not stand in game play sound battel system ........ and o ya cloud VS alex .... ooooo that wood be nasty for alex heheheheheheheh well sents not all games are FF7 i say its grait good old solid rpg game play pretty good battel theme cool monsters and kyle wase cool ok remeber the STEW THE GRAIT
4,Greatest Anime RPG on Playstation,"If you are patient enough to get used to this game, you will love it. It's a great game with a wonderful story. The battle system can be a little old school, but once you get used to it, it's still good fun. Again, the story is awesome! The Anime cut-scenes are wonderful. They are from the same animators as Giant Robo. The music is great. It's full of great humor. Witty remarks and dirty jokes abound. I recommend this game for maybe 15+ not because of content, but because it's a more mature level of gaming, I think younger gamers might find it boring. Not a good first RPG to play either. Experienced Role-players only, this game is HARD."
4,Pleasing and Fun,"Great game! Very well done translation, but graphics are dated being that the game was originally on the Sega CD. Great anime and the voice acting is fairly well done. A good game, one of the better RPG's on the system. Not as good as FF7 or FF8, but better then most others. Other RPG's I recommend are Xenogears(my favorite playstation RPG), Grandia, and StarOcean."
5,The only RPG that every kid should have,When i first played this game i didn't know what to expect but when i did get into it it made me want to try to find it so i could buy it thats how much of a hold that it has on gamers.
4,Good but could be better,The LUNAR series for the Sega CD has always been my favorite games. Playstations new release of the game was the only reason I bought one instead of a Dreamcast. I think it is a great game but I think that the graphics aren't up to the Playstation standards. In other words it has the same 16 bit graphics as the origional. If you haven't played the old version then you need to buy this game. LUNAR is the best game ever made when it comes to the story and overall enjoyment. I just hope when Eternal Blue comes out it has the graphics that LUNAR deserves.
4,One of the best game in the turn of this century,Lunar when it first cam out was a very good gmae but with the new making to the playstaion this game became the best ever role-playing in this universe. The way they put the story line and the characters made magic with each other and the game it self is a challenge. If you looking for a good game this is your pick. you will be playing for days and days to come with non-stop action.
3,It used to be so much better,"It's simply not very true to the original. The game felt more like a total remake than a port to another system. There are far too many little changes in the places and plotlines. Sadly the graphics and sound are actually worse than the Sega CD version and the menus are terribly designed compared to the original simpler configuration. Had one never played the original this would be a great great game, but for anyone looking to relive the good old days its just not going to do the job for you."
4,Horrid game that not even the most hardcore gamer should buy,"There is 1 thing thats good about this game: its hard to find.This game has horrible controls, graphics, and story. No1 should buy this even if it came with a free PSX. Never rent it or buy it. It's just a waste of time."
4,THIS GAME DEFFINATLY GETS 5 STARS!,"If you think the Final Fantasy series is good, this is 1,000,000 times better. The graphics may not be the best, but the story, characters, action, fun, and laughter makes up for it. Best RPG I've played. It comes with 2 game discs, 1 music CD, 1 making of Lunar SSSC playstation disk, a hardback instruction book, foldable cloth map, and a cool case to carry it in. If you like RPGs, you will love this one!"
5,You HAVE to get this game!!!!,This game is the best!!!! I may not be all 3D but the anime and story make up for it. BUY THIS NOW!!!
4,interesting toy,"This is one interesting toy! I love the way it creates music when it floats on top of the water! You can even create music for it, which is something I've never thought would be possible. Kids today have it made!"
1,Wouldn't Know,"I wouldn't actually know how great (or not so great) this toy is because we placed our order on May 30 and today, June 28, still have not received it. So, the 'ships within 24 hours' statement is extremely misleading. We have approved multiple shipping delay emails and our only other recourse is just to cancel our order. So, track this toy down someplace else."
2,How is this a football cd??,"Hey, I love football with all my heart but this cd just isn't very good. The music is hardly about football, and it has no energy at all. There are a few tracks which I like, ""Let it Out"" probably being my favorite, but it still does not make me think about football. The anthem by Vangelis is good, but if you can, try to download the JS16 remix. (very good!) So if you want a really great cd that captures the energy and excitement of an event like this, don't buy this cd. BUY THE OFFICIAL EURO2000 CD! That is the greatest football cd ever made!! (and was a much better tournament as well!) Peace fellow football fans!"
1,Insulting and misleading,"Gerd Reinke is a well-established bassist, pedagogue and editor, but his interpretation of the Bach Suites are just insulting to the double bass. I don't understand why he decided to release an album filled with bad intonation, blocky phrasing, and just plain wrong notes. It's recordings like this that will keep the double bass from being respected by the rest of the musical community. Don't waste your time on these recordings, but instead find those by Edgar Meyer, Francois Rabbath, or Gary Karr for quality recordings of the Suites performed on bass."
3,Definitely different,"The cover says ""25 Christmas favorites sung in a fresh, new way"" and they are right about that. The artists deliberately set out to sing all of these songs in a way you have never heard before. Some I like, some I don't. The overall tone reminds me of the new age Christian artists. I give it three stars today, but maybe it will grow on me. I generally prefer traditional arrangements of Christmas songs."
5,RETURN OF THE GREATEST ...,"A brilliant collection of songs from Matt Johnson, who is, I agree, one of the greatest, most underrated British singer/songwriters of the past 20 years. This new CD is a boon for longtime fans but may also be a great starter set for those who are unaware of The The's continued brilliance. The new songs here, Pillar Box Red, Deep Down Truth and December Sunlight are even better then the tracks from earlier in their (his) career. Amazingly, after 20 odd years, Johnson still seems to be on an upward creative path long after most of his contemporaries have completely fallen by the wayside. I'd almost forgotten just how good Johnson really is. Great, great stuff."
5,Singularly excellent,"OK, so I'm a fan so I'm probably a little biased but people should really buy this so they can experience for themselves one of the greatest (and most underrated) songwriters and musicians of our generation. Spanning 20 years of recorded output, and including two new songs and a new twist on another this is just brilliant, brilliant stuff......"
3,"Long-awaited, but beware","This collection, on its face, contains the songs one would expect in a retrospective from The The. But things aren't as they seem. This disc contains alternate versions of some songs, and the cover of the disc does not mention this, which is misleading and deceptive. Most disappointing for me is the butchered, inferior version of ""This Is The Day"", my favorite The The song. The content is nonetheless sufficient to merit 3 stars."
2,Used for class only,"I got this book for a required math class. My teacher is not that great at student help so this book wasn't worth much to me except to do the problems the teacher assigned. Unless you have a great teacher who is willing to take time to explain and help you, this book won't be much good to you. My teacher has lost my interest in geometry but its not the book's fault. Like I said, if you have a good teacher, the book will be worth something to you."
5,It's just what we needed and in the advertised condition - very happy,It's just what we needed and in the advertised condition - very happy with the purchase and the book. This is out first opportunity to teach a college class after 35 years in High School.
1,not current addtion,It was not clear what edition this was. The current edition is the fifth and this offering was the third edition. Disappointing.
4,This is brain music!,I became a collector of music from Hefty Records when my friend turned me on to Bill Ding and Slicker ... This album has flowing moods that are followed by sudden hits of energy. I compare it to a rollercoaster ride at night. Moving through cool dark air I feel the glides and swerves of the rhythm. Only when I think I see the next curve does the band drop me 10 stories straight down...then quickly lifts me back to that swift ebb.
3,Cynthia Gregory & Fernando Bujones Together,"They are incredible together or individually! Frequently badly lit and the wandering camera angles made me crazy, but anything is worth it just to see them. The ""extra"" interview with Cynthia was good, too."
2,I wanted to like it,"Everyone starts a book with the hopes of a great read. Unfortunately, I found myself struggling to complete a book where the most vivid character was the dog. The wooden dialogue and thinly drawn characters soon wore out their welcome. I finished only to see if the dog would live... but I'm not telling. Two stars for the author's uncanny ability to get such average work in the bookstores."
3,"A fast page-turner, but so-so plot","This book is about the crime among the rich and influential. I simply bought this book because it involves a clever dog. (I'm a dog lover, so everything with dogs interests me.) I've never known Stuart Woods before. This is his first book I've read. I finished it in 2 days and am happy to recommend it as a ""beach book"". You may need another book if you want to tan deeply' cause this book will give you a slightly brown complexion. :-DWood's language is easy to read, follow and understand. The way he writes is similar to Sidney Sheldon's, but with less narrative and psychological stuff. Perhaps it is because of their involvement in showbiz. Expect to read fast moving scenes, like those in detective movies/series. Don't expect anything deep. You won't have to THINK at all while you are reading this book. Just watch!"
3,"Ok, but not great...again....","This is the third book by Woods that I have read. I am not sure why I keep on going back to his books to read them...something always catches my eye, and I end up reading his books. This one was ok...I would call it a very low three marking on this one. I was kinda bored and I had a hard time finishing it in the last 50 pages or so. I wish that Stuart would have developed the story a bit more, and I agree with one reviewer, when they said, ""In the last chapters, it seemed as though he (the author) had something else to do, and just wanted to finish the book."" I definately seemed that way to me as well, I was not really impressed with the plot, and again, it really was not that well developed. At times it reminded me of the situation in Waco, Texas...as hard as that may seem to believe. Be prepared to be left in the outfield with this one!!!"
4,"fast reading, kept my attention.","I've never heard of Stuart Woods until I was in the store and happened to pick up this book. I read the first few pages and when I realized I couldn't put it down I had to buy it. I don't think Woods spent enough time explaining the lawyer boyfriend. He was suddenly dating Holly and I had a hard time picturing him because there wasn't enough said about him. Yet he's in the rest of the story. I found it very predictable but interesting enough to not want to put it down. I believe what one reader wrote, once the FBI got involved the story was basically about Palmetto Gardens and it seems like they forgot about the investigation of the Chief. Put it this way, I've read many books before. The one before this was Hannibal. That took me 3 months to read due to lack of interest. (no offense, Hannibal bored me, Silence of the Lambs was great) Either you have it or you don't. Orchid Beach took me 1 week to read. I'm looking forward to reading more of Woods books."
1,Stank,"I bought the book just to read on a plane flight. It was a total waste of money. Woods has a choppy writing style that's about the level of elementary school. No charactor developement. Minimal description and about all the dog does is eat, poop in the yard and ride in the car. Not that I wanted something too cerebral on a plane flight but this book is so inane it's pathetic. I've learned my lesson... I'll pack a good book next time and never read Stuart Woods again."
4,Orchid Beach (Holly Barker) by Stuart Woods,Orchid Beach is enjoyable and well written. Holly Barker and her father are both interesting characters; showing a human touch and they work together to solve crimes..
2,Don't Bother,Trust me the best thing about this book is the front cover. There are plenty of much better books on the market.
2,"I love ya Stuey, but you're losing me....","Remember Chiefs? One of the best. How about Palindrome, Dead Eyes, Grass Roots? Great books. While reading Orchid Beach, I felt as though I was reading a Nancy Drew mystery."
4,"Reliable, steady book","I have only read a couple of Stuart Wood's book that have fallen below the average mark. Most of his writing is pretty consistant, gets right to the story, and usually interesting. This book features a good story and good characters. You won't be disappointed."
2,A disapointment,"I have read all the novels by Stuart Woods since 'Chiefs' 1981 (which I consider as his best novel) and enjoyed them all more or less. This last book 'Orchid beach' is not even close regarding plot and characters descriptions. The plot is less than thin. The characters are simply not interesting. The style reminds me of some mystery books like 'The Hardy brothers solves a case' that I read as a kid. Though-out the book I repeatedly asked myself when the heroine was going to think or do the most obvious things and check-up, that every normal person would do in her situation... I don't expect Holly Barker to show up again in another novel after this fiasco."
2,disappointing,"Less than halfway through the book, I had a hard time believing that it was written by Stuart Woods. It was somehow empty. The story developed too quickly. But, I will not give up on S.W. I will read his next book as soon as possible and hope for ""better""."
2,Hardly a page turner.,"Remarkably, this book is claimed to be a suspenseful mystery. Yet, the reader will learn after the first few chapters that there is little mystery and no suspense. Instead, Orchid Beach is a novel written at an elementary school reading level. It lacks no imagination and is predictable from the beginning. Woods attempts to grab the readers attention with a homicide and shooting but fails to hold on to the reader as he drags the story out with one dead end after another. Furthermore, the heroine, Holly Barker is hard to buy as the sharp detective Woods attempts to create. Woods tries to grab the readers attention by making her tom-boyish and sexual. But she just comes across as a naive tart who has a really smart dog."
2,Not what I've come to expect from Woods,"I have to admit that reading Stuart woods is one of my more guilty pleasures. They are fast, easy, enjoyable reads, and I look forward to each new effort. Having said that, I was disappointed in Orchid Beach. It started out nicely and promised to be a quick read, but I slowly lost interest in finding out how it ended. The ending was somewhat muddled, and I was never really clear why the bad guys were in fact the bad guys because their crimes as well as their faceless remained a mystery. I am still a Woods fan, but I hope his next effort has more kick. Bring Stone back."
3,A Good Quick Read,"I have read most of Stuart Woods' books so I obviously enjoy them, but I must agree with another reviewer in that some are better than others. I found Orchid Beach fairly entertaining with some great characters, but the weakness in the book lies in it's ending. Just as you really get into the thick of it, it seems like Mr. Woods has something else to do and ends the book in one quick chapter.A great book to read on a trip, but if your looking for a deep story to emerse yourself into...look elsewhere."
3,Enjoyable Lightweight Read,"I liked the characters in this story and would like to see them return in some future exploit. The suspense as to who the mole in the PD reminded me a little of some of the mysteries by Agatha Christy. The story held together well, although I thought the ending a little far-fetched. An enjoyable, lightweight read."
3,"Not Woods Best, but enjoyable.","I've read better by Stuart Woods, but Orchid Beach was enjoyable. He usually gives more depth to his plots, and this book was written as if it was an ""afterthought"". I did enjoy the character of Holly, and I'm guessing she will appear in future novels. Too bad he didn't focus on Daisy, the Doberman, more. There was plenty of plot to do so, but...."
4,Fast Read,"I've just recently introduced myself to S.W. books. I enjoyed Orchid Beach very much. To those who are not a SW fan, may find the book lacking compared to others that he has written, but I still enjoy his writing. This one kept me going. The ending really surprised me."
3,shallow but interesting,"This is not his best nor his worst. It was a fast read and I liked the heroine, especially her dog. The characters were not well developed and the plot was shaky. However, it kept my interest. Probably only a fan, which I am, would like it."
4,Refreshing change of pace! Enjoy a breather from STONE,"Ok! She's no Stone Barrington, but Holly Barker and Daisy arrived just in the knick of time. I found Wood's new characters refreshing and look forward to having their personalities fleshed out even more in future novels. I enjoyed the fast read,new characters and local. If you are looking for a change of pace this is the book for you. It's ENTERTAINMENT!"
4,Great New Stuart Woods Protagonists!,"I've never stopped loving Stuart Woods novels, ever since I read Chiefs in the early 1980s, and I usually buy them the second they're out. This was well worth waiting for. While there were some illogical plot points in solving the murders, I liked the primary characters much more than those in his last few efforts, and hope that he will bring them back to cross paths with Will Lee, the hero in Chiefs. As usual, this was a quick read, finished in a long afternoon. I can't wait for his next and hope all Stuart Woods fans will join me in encouraging him to write about Delano, GA and its characters (from Chiefs) again!"
2,A disappointment,"to read Stuart Woods latest novel. The plot was thin and I never managed to develop a relationship to the book and the characters. Compared with all his other fine novels, this one is a failure. Save your time and money. Leave this book on the shelf."
2,Disappointing,"This was a waste of money and time. I bought the book because I'm in a law enforcement career, my favorite dogs are Dobermans, and I'd seen enough Stuart Woods books around that I thought he was a popular author, but I shouldn't have bothered.The dog has very little to do with the story, this supposedly intelligent policewoman falls for and trusts one of the lawyers way too fast, no character development for you to feel like you 'know' them, and the ending was too 'normal' instead of being something interesting and surprising. There's other disappointments but those are the biggies."
5,Another good one,I just started reading Stuart Woods about 6 months ago and now I can't get enough of him. I love Stone Barrington and because of his series I got interested in Holly. Orchid Beach really kept my attention and I didn't want to put it down. Since reading it I have read two more books in the Orchid series and look forward to reading more. I wish the books weren't as expensive as they are but they are still worth the extra money. I buy Stuart Woods every chance I get. This is a great read and I highly recommend it to all.
4,Good Light Read,"I liked all of the Stone Barrinton books, this is a nice departure. While the plot is ""light"", it is still worth the read. There are enough plot twists to keep you interested all the way through."
2,Lousy! Must have phoned this one in.,"I have read just about all of Stuart Woods books and this one just doesn't cut it. It starts off good and intriguing but within the first third of the book everything just gets too pat, there seems to be no development of the characters and the story is more than outrageous, it is bizarrely improbable. Holly, the main character never shows the color of classic Wood's characters like Stone Barrington or Dino, his former police partner. Once I was halfway through I couldn't decide whether to finish the book or bag it. I still really like Stuart Woods but I feel this book must have been pushed out the door to make a publishing commitment, or surely something like that. Unless you are a Woods die hard (which I pretty much am) I would pass on this one."
1,"Wood's novels get dopier and dopier-shallow,shallow.shallow","I have read every one of Wood's books, starting with his first, ""Chiefs"" which was good. But he has gone downhill ever since. I now read them only to satisfy myself that he is getting worse with each outing. His characters are cardboard and his dialogue and plots are pathetic. What happened to this novelist? The loose ends in his plots are never picked up, and in one page he covers territory and decisions that other writers would spend chapters developing, with some depth. His favorite lines seem to be ""good idea"" or ""I agree"", so that further development of the theme becomes unnecessary. In his latest book, for example, in one page, his heroine goes from being a major in the service to agreeing to become a police chief without asking one question about her new job from a person she met just a minute ago--PURE WOODS!!!"
5,This one is impossible to put down...,I loved it! Daisy is a great character who finds herself alone in a town where she is suddenly in charge of the murder of her would-be boss. I couldn't turn the pages fast enough. I would recommend this one to most anyone - especially if you read and liked Palindrome (which I still think is Woods's best).
1,Perhaps Woods' worst book,"Overly contrived, poorly plotted, poorly written and poorly edited (several typographical errors). The reader must make so many leaps of faith it beggars the imagination. The characters aren't sympathetic. You really don't care what happens to them. And what happens to them is so forced it's laughable. Don't bother with this book"
3,great disappointment,"I agree with many reviewers, I also saw this book as a nearly perfect one until I reached the end of the story. But, once I turned the last page I was ready to scream in disappointment - what a stupid thing where the puzzle does not have a single well fitting piece."
5,Awesome!!,"This is a very AWESOME pillow! It fits my head perfectly! Its great to use on the couch or in the car, maybe even a plane! Its just so cool. Its soft and very comfortable! I even find myself holding it when I watch Fullmetal Alchemist. I highly recommend this is your a Fullmetal Alchemsit fan."
3,Dot matrix printer ribbon,"I don't know how to rate this ribbon at this time. It arrived on time, but I have not yet tried it to see if it will work on my old printer. I hope it does."
1,Picture product does not match item you recieve!,"You cannot review a product that you do not receive. The picture is correct if you want a OR534-18, a 5 3/4 disk with a 7/8 in arbor and 1/8 in thick disk. however what you get is a 4 1/8 inch disk and when contacted the seller about possible mistake he stated that this 4 1/8 in disk is what is advertised. NOT According to the PICTURE and part number on the picture and to include the over all size of the disk."
3,The Journey Home,"*** Gathering the work of several authors in a common theme, this anthology deals with soldiers trying to make it home after war, whether in the distant past or the far future. Some of the stories are fairly standard ghost tales, much like campfire standards or fairy tales, others, more imaginative. Among the later entries is a story set in an established ""universe"" of one of the authors' making, and readers may feel lost if they have not read books in that series. However, for the most part, the stories need no ""historical"" knowledge to enjoy. ***"
