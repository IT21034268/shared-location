4,Exploration of Biraciality,La Guma's short stories give an excellent feel for the struggle with biraciality in South Africa- the imagery is so clear that you can almost see what the characters see and feel what the characters feel.
1,This short story struggles...,"Within such short context, La Guma goes into great detail about minuscule and usually unimportant aspects of apartheid and the continued collapse of African tradition and society. He introduces many characters and explains too much about each one, straying the reader from the main ""crux"" of the story. This does in fact work well for the description of the society in which the story takes place, and paints a morbid, dreadful glance at the decaying African society for it's readers to interpret. He fails to follow through with some important details, which makes it more frustrating to read. If you are looking for a story which tells the absolute truth of life and the hardships it brings, without any positive resolution, I would recommend this book. Otherwise... I wouldn't suggest this for people who are easily depressed and looking for quick, easy and interesting read."
5,a great album from a great group,"This the 4th CD by Oysterband that I have purchased, and once again they have not let me down. Of special note: ""Lovers In A Dangerous Time,"" ""Our Lady of the Bottles,"" and ""Don't Slit Your Wrists For Me."" A little humor from the Oysters is always good. As long as they put out music like this, I'll keep buying their CDs."
3,Cheap fabric,"This product is okay. The bodysuit is not true to size (it is not long enough, even though the size i purchased is usually too big for my son) and the pants ""pilled"" after one wash, so they look very old. Also not very breathable, so the outfit is pretty warm on my son. It fits the purpose, but I would not order again."
1,I did not like it,Well this book wasn't very good the other reviews were pretty much right. I wanted to do it for a book report but it was basically just the movie in words. I would not suggest it.
5,Life Changing,This book changed my entire outlook on life. It is one of the most powerful pieces of non-fiction of the modern era.
3,"Fun little book, gets old quickly.","Being a big JLH and IKWYDLS fan, I got this book as soon as I discovered it. Though I didn't expect much from it, I did expect more than what I read. The book itself is pretty informative, but it's either stuff you probably already know or stuff you don't care about. It's very directed towards girls, too (ex. ""OMGZ DAT FREDI PRINZ JUNUR IZ SOOO KEWT!!!!!!). The pictures aren't reall that amazing, too. I only reccomend it for die-hard fans of the series."
1,A look into the ditzyness of America,"This book was basically a publicity stunt for Jennifer Love Hewitt and Brandy, because I saw no other reason for it. Honestly, who would want to read all the details of ""behind the scenes"" of a movie when you could sum it all up in a magazine article? I thought the book would have more substance. It basically consists of some drawn-out story of what happened while a movie was being made and what happened in the movie. I'm just glad I borrowed the book and didn't waste my money on it."
2,Not much here,"This book provides a few decent insights into the mind of an autistic child, and a few tidbits that sort of qualify as a history of autism. But there isn't enough substance to be worth reading. For a good depiction of an autistic child, see Daniel Mont's A Different Kind of Boy instead. For some history, see Wikipedia."
1,Very poor sound quality hides Landowska's genius.,"I was very disappointed by this recording. I love Wanda Landowska's playing, and I have almost every recording she has made. To me, she is the greatest keyboard artist since recording technology was invented.This recording is of a live performance in 1945, and the sound of the piano is blurry and indistinct. Usually Landowska has a magic touch on the piano, producing a very special pure soft sound that no one else can match. Unfortunately, almost none of that can be heard on this recording."
4,"Even if not quite top tier for a D Francis book, this still a good story.","I am a big fan and reread all of his books regularly. Even the less successful books are worth reading for the storyline. Always a new setting, many likeable characters and some clever plots keep these books favorites. I am sorry that Mr. Francis passed away this year but look forward to his son picking up the writing mantle."
4,"Shattered, Dick Francis","I loved this story. It has a lot of twists and turns, so you have to pay attention. I catch new details every time I listen to it. I love his stories."
3,A Star at Twilight,"Even in its twilight, a star can give off lovely light. So it is with Dick Francis. As Shattered clearly shows, the powers of a super-nova of the thriller genre are continuing on the wane. All the familiar Francis elements his fans -- and I am one of them -- have long loved are here. The eminently likeable hero. The mystery with a racetrack tie-in. The beatings the hero must endure. The softly sweet romance. And an offbeat field of interest, in this case glass-blowing. The glass blowing stuff is fascinating. Unfortunately, it is more fascinating than the slow-moving, improbable plot, spelled out with greater detail than the characters of the mystery. I guess we care about Gerard Logan, our virtuoso glass-blower and hero, but not with the depth of heroes of former Francis novels. And the romance with his policewoman is stated rather than felt. Even Francis' deft little touches which subtly show two people developing a love for each other are muted. This is Francis lite."
3,Wait til it comes to the library,"Definitely not his best book. Very loose weave on the plot. A who-are-these-people throughout. John Grisham is loosing it; why not Dick Francis? Readable, but don't pay for it."
2,So-so,"I have written every word Mr. Francis has ever written. I think that this book strays too far from the original concepts Mr. Francis used to write about. How long has it been now since there has been a novel about actual horse people, and not just ""friends"" of jockeys or trainers? I found the characters in this novel likable enough, but the plot was convoluted and difficult at times to really understand where Mr. Francis was coming from. I would like to see a return to the intrigue of books such as Risk or Twice Shy. Anyone agree with me?"
3,A solid if not exceptional work.,"Shattered returns Dick Francis readers a step closer to the horseracing world than his last book ""Second Wind."" Still, as the horseracing world is only a background image in Shattered, so is much of the storytelling passion. Francis is at his best when his characters feed off of their own equestrian experiences for strength, e.g. Sid Halley. In those stories the reader can connect the hero's inner resolve to their passion for riding. Its more difficult for Francis to project why the reader should feel the same about Shattered's protagonist, a mild mannered glass blower.Die hard Dick Francis fans will find Shattered a nice diversion until his next book, but will rate it a second class addition to his collection. Those new to Francis will find it an easy read and may be intrigued enough to delve into some of his first class works. I suggest Decider, Hot Money, or Proof."
3,Not his best work by a long shot.,Unimaginative in places and very plodding at times. I started to give up on it a couple of times.
3,3 stars for the past,"As a Dick Francis fan for nearly twenty-five years, I anxiously await his new novels. Unfortunately, this years effort lacks the quality of most Francis' works. It is a book that I had to push myself to keep reading. I kept hoping that maybe the next chapter would be the one that hooked my interest. None did!The hero, Gerard Logan, is as likeable as any Francis character. What is most disappointing is the cast of villains. They are not so much villains as they are just plain rotten people. They lack the evil that made so many of Francis' characters despicable.The plot itself fails to hold your interest, which is so unlike Dick Francis. With all that said, I am still a Dick Francis fan. For any other author it would be a one or two star book, but in thanks for all the wonderful reading hours DF has given me, 3 stars for the past."
5,Top Shelf As Per Usual,"We all have friends, families, aquaintances and coworkers and they are all tied intricately together in this thing called life. Dick Francis does his usual superb job in bringing it all together, showing some of the ugly along with the lovely while he exposes his newest choice of topics in this book about a glass blower. He grabs your attention from the first page and using the back drop of English Steeple Chase he carries you over the treacherous ditches and jumps and leads you round the final bend toward the winning post. I have read every novel that Mr. Francis has penned and have yet to turn the final page and be dissappointed. Finished this one in 2 nights. Couldn't put it down."
2,Bring back Sid!,"Ok, but nowhere near as good as some of his earlier novels: The Danger, Banker, Proof, et al... Nowhere near as gripping, the plot and characters in Shattered seemed forced and unrealistic in comparison."
1,This Book Leaves Me ... Shattered,"Dick Francis is one of my all-time favorite writers, not only in the mystery department but bar none.Unfortunately, he did not retire anywhere near the top of his impressive abilities. This book reads like cheap knock-off of a Dick Francis novel by a second-rate hack with the literary ""abilities"" of a J. K. Rowling or a Felix Francis. It's not worth your money or even your free time.Very sad indeed."
5,In the winner's circle again.,Best writer in my library stall. Clean face fast pace. If it was a race horse we'd all be betting on it.
2,A disappointment,"I'm a Francis fan of long standing, and picked up _Shattered_ with hopes of reading his usual, well-crafted story and characters. Unfortunately, while the book has its good moments (the glassblowing background is well done, and the main character is a great, though ""typical"" Francis hero), the plot was simply dreadful. Things didn't hang together, but instead meandered all over the place, and I found myself skipping pages (I've never done that in one of his books before). If you're looking for the good stuff, go back to Hot Money, Bolt, The Danger, or other earlier books, because unfortunatly this book isn't worth the read."
2,Another Subpar Effort from Francis,"I thought this book was as dismal as Francis' other recent works. The characters were lacking in depth. The plot didn't hold together. Characters made convenient and unbelievable personality changes. The character offered up as a sacrifice at the end was such a nonentity I had to check back to figure out who he was. And why, if the main character was so anxious to have his friends act as bodyguards, did he have them all too far away to help when he set up a confrontation?"
1,Rotten as all later books are,For a long tome the thrillers by Francis have been getting from bad to worse. Allthough for nearly 20 books Francis was on the top og his/her career in thrillerwriting the last ten books have been very bad. Characters are hardly workes out and the plot is not right. When is the editor of the publisher going to tell man and wife Francis that enough is enough.
2,My Illusions Shattered,"So very unlike the Dick Francis I have come to expect. Weak and pale characters, stilted dialog, badly woven plot. I kept paging back to the front to see if Dick Francis had died leaving only an outline that some substandard author had ""filled in."""
2,Shattered is correct.,Shattered is correct. Dick Francis is human after all. The plot moved around so much I thought the story was about a moving van. At times it was interesting but then Gerard Logan would appear in the third person and the theme went every which way. His thoughts and theories were scattered. It never made me think. It is no where near what Mr. Francis is capable of.
2,Couldn't finish the 'race'.,"I have read all of Dick Francis' books and was so eager to read his latest but was shattered by the dull pacing, the even duller characters and the unbelievable villans - especially the female character! It was such a poor read, especially the conclusion, that I threw the book down without reading the last few pages - Francis never reaches the finish line in this book - if he were a horse, someone would need to put him down."
3,Singing Bone Diluted,"A not entirely successful experiment: instead of focusing on the activities of Inspector French, the story is seen entirely from the perspective of the murderer, a businessman facing bankruptcy who deludes himself into the belief that his two murders are committed for the greater good, and seems to suffer from Macbeth's conscience. Although the murderer is better-drawn than most Croftsian cardboard figures, the other characters are all flat, and there are no twists in the tale. French appears only two or three times during the course of the story, and, rather than detecting, explains how the murderer committed his crime in rather laborious detail. Many scenes show this to be a pale imitation of Francis Iles's Malice Aforethought."
2,Don't buy the Kindle Edition,"My rating is not in relation to the contents of the book (I haven't been able to read it yet), it is just a warning for others to NOT buy this book in its Kindle edition.Being a technical book, it has a lot of mathematical symbols, which are not displayed by Kindle!! only a little square is displayed instead of different symbols (less than, greater than, etc.). Also while using my computer to read it (Kindle for PC) NONE of the Figures are displayed!With no figures and no symbols in a technical book, this kindle version is useless. I'm returning it and buying the paper version."
5,Excellent book explaining mathematics through pictures,Proof without words really opened my insights into how some of the proofs of formula came about. Sometimes we just take for granted the formula and do not discover how they came about. Through graphics and pictures we are able to visualize better.
3,don't expect too much,Is geometric intution important? You betAre these pictures inspiring? well case by caseIs this picture new and fresh? Not at all. I can tell over 90% in high school textbooks in my country. Probably you can in your own.
2,I'm not wild about this book.,"I'm a math teacher and this is one of several books that I purchased for reading during my summer vacation. This book would have benefited greatly from short descriptions or annotations to go along with the proofs, most of which I've seen elsewhere. If I had thumbed through this book in a store I would not have bought it."
4,A relaxing mix of multicultural soundscapes,"Being a strict fan of synthesizer-based new age music, I wasn't sure what to expect from the Buddha Lounge series. Most world music tends to be too windy and quiet to spark my interest...but these compilations seem to have a more powerful alure than the jazzy atmosphere of most music of this type. Buddha Lounge 3 is a relaxing mix of all kinds of world and new age music elements, and is an enjoyable experience from beginning to end. The only drawback is that it lacks the epic excitement of works by artists like Yanni, Enya, and Vangelis. However, this is good compilation to use if you're in the mood for something non-dramatic and mellow. If that sounds like your cup of tea, definitely check out the other two in the series as well."
1,Agreed absolute junk,Purchase a couple months ago and finally got around to using it today. Just makes a big mess and leaks everywhere. While the concept is good in theory this product is garbage.
1,Garbage,This thing is a total piece of junk. Don't waste your money on this. Tried using it once and all it did was shoot brake fluid everywhere.
1,Anakin Skywalker lousy action figure,"We got this action figure expecting much more. It is about 2 3/4 inches tall, and comes with a backpack and gun. The backpack is difficult to get on, and when it is on, Anakin cannot stand up because the backpack is too heavy. The gun doesn't fit in Anakin's hand. The action figure itself is the only decent part of this set. You get what you pay for with this item."
2,Seller does not disclose that you need chip reader that is not included,"My daughter is happy with the action figure, but very disappointed in what appears to be a bait and switch. The description indicates that the product comes with a Comm Tech chip and a Talking voice chip. What the seller fails to inform the buyer, is that for those chips to work, one needs to buy a COMMTECH Reader. Very disappointing to an 8 year old who was eagerly awaiting the delivery of this action figure. I will not purchase from this seller again."
5,Compiled and written by Romania's foremost expert,"Compiled and written by Romania's foremost expert on the ancient history of Dobrogea Adrian Radulescu (former director of the Museum of History and Archeology in Constanta), Ovid In Exile is a informed and deftly presented study of the life and works of the Roman poet Publius Ovidius Naso. Born in central Italy in 43 B.C., Naso was an aristocrat and a practitioner of law whose verse (especially his erotic poetry), left an indelible influence in western literature down through the centuries. A welcome addition to Romanian History and Roman Literary Studies, extensive research and unique insights hallmark this thoughtful and very highly recommended examination."
4,A GREAT Read,"Rosie's Curl and Weave was an excellent book. This was the first time that I had read something of its kind and I thoroughly enjoyed the stories. Collectively, these authors have a wonderful writing style and it provided me with hours of relaxed, intellectual, romantic reading pleasure."
4,E N J O Y A B L E,"THESE SHORT STORIES ARE BEAUTIFUL AND GRACEFUL. THEY WERE VERY ENLIGHTENING. I ENJOY SOME SHORT STORIES BUT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN I WANT THEM TO CONTINUE, HOWEVER, THESE STORIES BEGAN AND ENDED SO BREATH-TAKING. IF YOU ENJOY SHORT STORIE PLEASE DO PICK UP THIS BOOK, REGARDLESS OR NOT THEY WILL MAKE YOU BLOOM DELICATELY"
4,Nice,This book was a nice and relaxing read. I really enjoyed the stories by Francis Ray and Rochelle Alers the most. I would definitely recommend this book.
3,Great Traveling Book,"I picked this book up on vacation and I really enjoyed the short stories. I was particularly impressed with the stories written by Francis Ray and Donna Hill. I will probably buy the follow-up ""Della's House of Style."""
4,Romance collection,"Four great romance stories from four of the best, Rochelle Alers, Donna Hill, Felicia Mason, and Francis Ray."
4,Good beach book,"Lighthearted fun that shows love is not only for the young. I liked Felicia Mason's story the best (felt it was the most realistic,) followed by Donna Hill's, and Francis Ray's (even though the connection to the salon in this particular story was practically non-existent). Rochelle Alers' heroine's inability to figure out the obvious was off-putting to me, but hey, nobody's perfect."
5,Four Captivating Stories,"It's been ages since I've read short stories. This was a great reintroduction. All of the stories were entertaining. One good thing about short stories, there is no overkill of words. I bought this book, because Felicia Mason was at a local book store autographing copies. I was not dissapointed. If you like romance and short stories then Rosie's Curl and Weave is what you want."
4,A Delightful Bag of Stories,"I like the idea of four love stories centered around a salon. The stories are wonderful, funny, and easy to read. A bonus is Felicia Mason's 50-something couple - how many times have you read a romance with middle-aged people as the lead characters?The third story, ""The Awakening"" however doesn't really fit in - there's only a token mention of the salon, otherwise it's as if it's all on its own, unconnected with its three sister novellas.One small grumble, Rosie's Curl and Weave is a high-class posh salon. I can't help feeling that if it's a simple charming surburban salon, with middle-class characters, the anthology will be even more a gem."
4,PRETTY GOOD FOR SHORT STORIES,THIS BOOK WAS PRETTY GOOD. THE STORIES WERE WRITTEN NICELY. THE ONLY PROBLEM THAT I HAD WITH THE BOOK IS THAT ONCE YOU GOT INTO ONE STORY IT WAS OVER AND THE NEXT STORY STARTED. OFTEN WHEN READING THE NEW STORY MY MIND DRIFTED BACK TO THE PERVIOUS ONE. BUT IN GENERAL THE AUTHORs DID A VERY GOOD JOB
3,Pretty Predictable,This book was ok. It is predictable. There was not a whole lot of questions about what would end up happening next.
4,Line Dance Start Up,"Reasonably easy to follow but a bit fast paced on the up take. Still, I enjoyed the DVD and recommend it."
3,Line dancing to a few songs,Instruction from woman was good but there were only a few songs on the dvd. One dance did not warrant a full segment (2 step). I would have like to have learned more dances to more popular music of today.
2,This just didn't cut it.,This CD is not geared for beginners. Physical demonstrations are confusing and move too fast. Would probably work for someone familiar with the dances.
5,This is the way to learn to dance!,If you at all interested in learning to western dance this is the lesson you want. The lessons are simple and easy to understand. Brooke makes the learning fun and I can't wait to head out and try my moves! I know there are other products out there with similiar lessons but they don't hold a candle to this step-bystep instruction. It even has bonus lessons.
2,Great Idea -- poor execution,"This book is not for someone who wants to understand what it takes to understand and implement an eCommerce business plan or channel. The book is filled with bland examples, limited detail, and few conclusions. If you are looking to actually crack the value code and make the tough decisions necessary to compete in the digital economy. This one is not it. Save your money and save your time.Sorry to be so harsh, but the book doesn't live up to the repuation of a big company like AA !"
5,The corporate GENOME decoded!,"Finally, someone has taken the time to write a business book that makes sense to the people who make the wheels of business turn: Everybody. This book explains how tech stocks can rally with negative earnings while solid fundamentals can't hold up some blue chips. It's all about HOW you value a company! Intellectual and other intangible assets don't have a place on the balance sheet, yet they're worth a tremendous amount to a company's value. How is this so? How is this measured? The answers are in this book and it's a fascinating read."
2,"The style you'd expect, but missing some fine touches.","I bought this CD on a whim, being a Europhile and fond of most of the dance tracks coming out of Scandinavia these days. This CD set is vaugely reminiscent of the ""Best Of Techno Trax"" compilations in the early '90s. That is to say, very electronic, fairly simplistic, without much layering or polish. This set comes with a third ""Surprise CD"", which in my case was LCD's Hypnotic (I think you can get this particular album independently... look for ""Ender Fun""). If you find this in a bargain bin in some dusty old record store somewhere, it might be worth having in your collection. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother. Not to push the point, but the artwork on the CD jacket says ""3 cd's for one low price!"", which should tell you something."
1,fragile as glass!,"with mic clips, you get what you pay for. bought two of these for home studio. put shure 58's in them and the both split down the middle. plastic army men are more durable than these things. spend another couple bucks, trust me!"
1,Highly Defective Product,This item broke during the first use. The material is flexible to the point of cracking immediately while simply placing the microphone into it. Warning not worth a dime!
3,One of Three Broke,"The first time that I put microphones in them, one of them broke right away, just like other people said would happen. The price is hard to beat, so I guess it's almost worth buying a couple of extra to keep on hand. They work great in a pinch, but they're not a permanent solution, especially if you're trying to work professionally, but on a shoestring budget, such as for a non-profit or a Church."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I received my microphone clip today. I put it on the microphone stand at 6:00 PM. It is 10:00 PM and the clip just broke. What a crappy product. I have not called the company, and do not intend to waste my time. Don't buy this product."
2,What you see is what you get....,"...and what I got was cheap rubber. When you snap the microphone clip onto the microphone, after a short time, it starts to break. But I have it 2 stars because if you SLIDE the clips onto the mics, you should be fine, but I suggest finding another clips."
1,Not for real mics..... Do not use with 57s or 58s,Ordered 2 and one has already broken.... Cheap NOT flexible...... Do no buy to use with 57s or 58s ...
4,"Good enough, no problems","I use this to hold a Neumann mic (22mm diameter, about 3/4 inch thick). Because this is a thinner mic, this clip does not hold it very tightly, however it is tight enough that it does not move around when used for a room mic. If I were using this mic on stage where it might be bumped, I probably would not use this clip because it is not that snug.However putting a 57 into this clip is really tight. I have had no problems and I have no complaints but I can see how repeated use with a ""normal"" diameter mic might stress this clip out.Cheap but functional, would probably buy again for the price."
2,Are we talking about the same OB book?,"I am surprised to see good reviews for this book. I found this book extremely useless after using it for my OB class this past fall. Besides the countless grammar and illustrated errors, the charts were hard to follow and sometimes went over multiple pages - sideways! Trying to copy them so I could take them with me to study was a nightmare. The one time I relied on the book and not my professors notes - I got a C on the test! The pictures for ROA LOA were wrong and it went over fetal monitoring minimally.I guess it is an easy read when almost every topic has a bulleted list. It makes select all that applies pop up every where...The pros... it was a decent size - not nearly as big as my med surge book.My recommendation? Buy the book used even tho there is a newer version just to read to be prepared for class. Otherwise, don't waste $105 like I did buying it new in August."
5,"Amazing book, one of the all time best on Disneyland","This book is considered by many the gold standard for Disneyland history, and with good reason. The documentation of the park through the eyes of postcards is not only brilliant, it provides important, well composed glimpses into the park's iconic attractions. An absolute must for any real Disneyland fan!!!!"
1,unclear steps,"This is basically two women talking, sometimes interrupting each other. They are so into telling their own personal stories and the stories of their patients that it is very difficult to pick out the steps they are recommending for self-improvement."
2,Ugh.,"I hate to be the one to go against the other reviews, but I had to with this one. I just didnt see why people liked the book. I found the designs to be very techy and old school...mostly examples of what computer design used to encompass. I wasnt inspired by any of the work in the this HUGE book. If you want cutting edge inspiration, look elsewhere."
1,STAY AWAY !,"This album is a a disgrace, despite the fact that Todd is one of the most amazing live performers you could possibly see. I gave it one star because it contains the most amazing guitar work that Todd has ever released on the track ""The Last Ride"". However, you can get this and all these recordings in the King Bisquit Flower Hour CD from which all this music was taken. That CD offers more music, it is all in the proper context and contains liner notes and annotation.This is cheap for a reason. It stinks !"
3,Pretty decent ...,"but not great. The recordings are live and the tracks are not ""mixed"" together to simulate a ""concert"". There is no liner info at all with the CD. I think the recordings vary from performances in the mid-70's to the mid-80's. The standouts are ""Real Man"" from the ""A Capella"" tour and ""Couldn't I Just Tell You"" from what I think is a mid-70's tour as the song is performed with the near-original arrangement and TR sounds pretty young. Oh...""Last Ride"" is good too. The kicker here for fans is ""Couldn't I Just Tell You"". Neophytes should go for another ""Best of"" CD. With that said...this is indeed a fine example of how well TR can sing and play live."
3,Nice figure,"I like this figures in order to recreate some scenes of the movies, and an important scene of the phantom menace is the one where Qui-Go Jinn dies. This figure is perfect to recreate that scene, and the price was reasonable for me."
3,Not Stainless Steel,"This is not stainless steel. It is polished aluminum. It is very thin, but it is sturdy. Good for reheating food."
5,Awesome!!,"This CD is such a great rememberance of an era! It brings me back to the 80's - a decade I remember so fondly - my favorite movies, fashions, hair styles and songs. When I first put it on I felt like I was in college again and the liner notes/booklet gave me such a chuckle and reminded me of so many crazy good times. A great collection of songs and a wealth of material in the booklet....When can I get volume 2?"
5,Brilliant!,"STORM OF DESIRE kept me on the edge of my seat...literally! I could not put it down! Chocked full of steamy passion and lots of adventure, I really felt the characters come alive. I enjoyed this book so much I bought extra copies to give to friends as gifts. SJANA is a talented new writer and I so look forward to reading more of her work!"
5,Could you answer a qustion for me?,"I haven't read this book, but want to know if this book would be a good book for a 16-year old to read. By that, I mean, is it ""dirty"" or anything...or is there just some innocent kissing...is it tame? I'd appreciate it if you'd give me your opinion, it's really hard to find a good historical, fiction, romance for a 16 year old! Thanks, Meg"
5,Excellent parshanut,"There is parshanut on the Shabbat that will enrich the reader's understanding of , and feeling for Shabbat."
5,Desire and Denial: Celibacy and the Church,This book is very well written and shows how the Church's requirement of celibacy has hurt so many men and women. A must-read for Catholics to understand why their church is imploding.
1,Don't order this one-,"I have a few comments about this chessboard. First, I bought it for only ten bucks a few months ago at a retail toy store. I'm not sure why it is priced this high here. Second, the board itself looks like it is etched glass but it isn't. I was playing last night with a friend who was eating Cheetos. Somehow little Cheetos pieces landed on the board last night...I hope it was when I got him with the surprise checkmate! Anyway, I went to clean it off this morning and wherever Cheetos had landed they had lifted off the white opaque covering that passes for the filled-in squares. That's why I am here looking for chessboards right now - I am going to have to toss this one. For ten bucks I'd consider it a disposable board and try to keep it away from any food or water. For more than ten bucks I'd keep shopping for a nicer set, which is exactly what I am doing."
1,"Great first impression, terrible wear quality!","I purchased this knife set after testing some at a bridal demo. I loved the feel, balance, and smoothness of their cut through tough things like carrots and celery. I cared for the knives as directed - hand wash and towel dry. Did not use sharpener. One month after purchase, I noticed that the tip had broken off one of the knives. I thought it seemed odd and figured it had been dropped at some point. By three months after purchase, 4 of the 6 knives that we has purchased were chipped - some in the middle of the blade! I returned ALL of them (and found several reviews online complaining of the same awful wear quality). I am looking into replacing them with a Global set, which seem to have even better reviews than Shun. The Shun knives make a great first impression but are TERRIBLE in wear quality!!!"
5,Very sharp knives,I bought this as a gift for some friends a few years back and they love them. Even to this day they rave about how sharp they are (and they do a fair amount of cooking).
4,"Extraordinary Bartok, skimpy coupling","Argerich and Freire play as equal partners in this unique recording of the powerful Bartok Concerto for two pianos. The Concergebouw lead by a young David Zinman has few equals in modern repertoire, and the percussionists shine in this complex and beautiful work.This particularly CD (which I have owned and treasured for more than 20 years) is rather skimpy in content at ~42' and the Kodaly Dances filler is certainly not on a par with the Bartok Concerto. I would recommend getting this Concerto with a lot more good to great piano music in this two-ferDuo Piano Extravaganza - Martha Argerich & Friends"
3,great until 10 months,"Wow, did we LOVE this stroller!! A snap to fold, carries EVERYthing so mommy doesn't have to, great for beaches, parks, all terrain and reclines beautifully for infants. THEN, my twins turned 10 months and they did not want to recline anymore... they wanted to sit up and see the world. I looked everywhere, called the manufacturer...no upright setting!? are you kidding me? I cant believe I ""invested"" $600 on a stroller that doesn't allow my girls to sit up. what a waste. Im not a jogger- I used this as my primary stroller and now I'm shopping for another stroller that will grow with my girls for the next few years. disappointed."
4,Path to Leadership,"You can't learn leadership from a book, but you can learn the styles including what works and doesn't. Therefore this book covers all the research for the last century or so on leadership. As such it is very good tool to work out why some styles of leadership (yours, your bosses) don't work, and why other do.This is the text for a Masters university course I am taking, so the book is of a very high academic standard.The book is very in depth, but also very American centric.I would suggest reading this book AND other books - such as ""The 7 Heavenly Virtues of Leadership"". That way you can start to see the concepts and styles of leadership at a broader level to make up your own mind on the style that is most productive for you and your team."
1,Hypocritical advice from a master schmoozer,"The ultimate hypocrisy. Here's a book full of ideas lifted from analysts and magazines, written solely to cash in on a trend. Perkins thinks so little of his advice that he did not follow his own suggestions. His magazine, The Red Herring, is a textbook example of dotcom excesses, bloat and ""what goes up must always go up"" thinking. Long after publication of the first edition, he was blithely making the same foolish mistakes he warns against in his book. As a result, the magazine went through a series of layoffs and downsizings and continues to teeter on the brink of insolvency.Tony Perkins is a master of getting invitations to events in Silicon Valley and sucking up to the insiders. But trust me, you do not want to waste your money on this cynical, hypocritical advice from someone who is a business failure."
1,Completely counter to the point of the book,"I have never forgiven this movie for destroying one of my favorite childhood books by completely reversing the message: the book is strongly affirming that you *can* succeed with enough determination and luck, whereas the movie changes that into ""ok, you've had your fun, come back to the real world and be a lemming with the rest of us, it's dangerous out there and you shouldn't even try""."
1,my side of the mountain,"I've had the book for many many years and I would reread it yearly for the purpose of going back in time when my cares were small and I enjoyed it better then. I even had the beta version of the movie and did not like the movie, not the people but it did not follow the book and I think it deserves a new movie and one about the follow up book too. My book has tape all over to keep it together and now that I am unable to work I prefer to live in my books and especially my side of the mountain. I would love to make a movie that follows the book more closely and I believe that it would make the greatest weekly show for small ones and big ones like me. I'm 48 and I've had my book over 30 years and would suggest it to anyone that would enjoy living off the land. Simply written and its held my interest for years. HGH"
2,Relieve those wilderness fantasies,"A well done movie yet doesn't follow the book well.Some parts of the movie that aren't in the book shouldn't have been in the movie either....better yet, read the two sequels to the book."
2,DUUUUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMB,This is the worst movie I ever saw. I DON'T reccomend this for any one. I do reccmend the book. My side of the mountain is a stupid fake!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,A BOOK THAT I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,AS I READ THIS BOOK IT GOT DUMBER AND DUMBER!!!! I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THE SURVIVIAL TECHNIQUES WERE COOL.IF IT HAD MORE EXCITEMENT I WOULD OF RATED IT BETTER!!!!!!! END
2,I read better books,The book was soooooooo boring. It should have had a better ending. so really he ran away from home for no reason at all. he ran Away then comes back.
2,A boy and his bird,"This move was partly about a boy and his bird frightful, i'd have to say that this movie is frightful. Very blasphemous to the book, that wasn't even that great."
1,a disgrace and horrid,"I WOULD SUPPORT THE IDEA OF A REMAKE. IF THERE WAS,THESE ARE THE THINGS TO DO: 1. EITHER MAKE GUS A RABBIT OR DON'T PUT HIM IN. 2. MAKE FRIGHTFUL A TRUE PEREGRINE. I NOTICED SHE WAS A PRAIRIE FALCON. 3. PUT THE BARON IN. 4. PUT IN JESSIE C.. 5. DON'T MAKE SAM GO HOME. 6. I THINK THIS IS THE HIGHLITE OF ALL THE MISTAKES, DO NOT, I MEAN DO NOT, KILL FRIGHTFUL!!!!!!!!"
5,my side of the mountain,"This movie is the kind of thing you dream about when you are a little boy.All the factors come into play here, the running away from home, the little animal friends for company-so you don't get scared or lonely,the hunting, the camping, the ability to self sustain.True action adventure in its original, purest form. This is a great family bonding movie, watch it before you go camping with the kids, or even before you build a treehouse in your backyard.If you give this movie a go i'm sure deep down inside you will really love it.I do.It's every adventure i wanted as a kid and still do."
3,My Side of the Mountain,"My wife is a high school teacher and wanted to use the movie as a comparison to the book. She was disapointed it the variations in the movie verces the book. However, as things turned out the whole idea turned into a great drill for her kids, listing the differences was a great teaching tool."
2,old times,A favorite movie of mine as a child. I bought it for the nostalgic memories. Not as good as I remembered but I am glad I bought it for times past.
2,Teacher Review,"As with all books made movie, I give a little space for differences. However, this movie takes away from the book's central themes and creates a totally different story. My students (Resource - Junior High) were extremely disappointed that the characters were changed so much. My own kids (boys 9 & 7) watched half of the movie and lost interest, never asking to finish. I was disappointed also."
5,My Side Of The Mountain is jeans best work ever,in school we are reading this book and it is the best book i have ever read
3,My Side of theMountain,"I too must say if I had never read the book, I would have enjoyed the movie. The movie was a bit disappointing, first off the movie is set in Canda. But the book is set in the Catskill Mountains in New York. Why the change? The Catskills are beautiful. Also as mentioned the bit about Frightful's death an the addition of Gus. While Gus was cute he simply didn't exist in the book. Why the changes, the book is perfectly find the way it was written. We may hope for a remake of the movie but it is highly doubtful this will come about. Hope this review was a bit helpful."
3,Suitable movie adaptation,"I saw this movie when it came out in 1968, and read the book years lateras an adult. It's not bad, IMO, and I thought Ted Eccles was charming,although his clothes seemed impossibly clean in the wilderness.There is no question that the book is much better, and the movieis chock-full of sentimental and well-worn cliches: running away from home,struggling against the elements, etc. But I would argue that in the 1960's,anyone making a G-rated movie version of this book would not have hadalot of options. No kid in the target demographic (urban, elementary schoolaged kids) is going to be drawn in to a movie without dialogue, conflictwith adults/authority figures (hunters & parents), and cute furrycreatures. Does anyone here think that kids would trade away theadorable raccoon for a silent movie, or even one voiced-over by Sam?"
2,1.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A mawkish adaptation of the children's novel, My Side of the Mountain leaves no corny or hokey stone unturned in its effort to bludgeon us with good cheer; even the six year old boys that the film was presumably targeted at will feel insulted by this painfully bad and thankfully forgotten film."
1,"What a horrible, horrible movie.","This movie resembles the book in that they share the same title. That's about it. The best things about reading the book are lost in the movie. The movie inexplicably adds some stuff that has no business being anywhere near something of this title. (""Algae experiments""? ""Hi, I'm Bando""?)It's not even bad in a way that would be entertaining, like watching Attack of the Killer Tomatoes would be. It's just...bad. I hope the author had nothing to do with this production except for being the recipient of a huge, public apology and possibly financial compensation."
5,A wonderful reference book for landlubbers who love the sea,"I go to Maine every year to paint the wonderful rocks and seas and boats. Seeing a sailboat from the safety of the shore (Iget seasick on a boat), doesn't give you nearly the perspective nor information that this book gives you. I have it, I've read it, I've used it, and now I'm sending it to a friend who loves to paint seascapes also."
4,Errata for the last review...,"Oops- I spoke to soon. Information for contacting the American Society of Marine Artists IS in the book after all. A little blue sidebar box... I just missed it, in the back of the book, just before the index."
2,Not Great,"Way too technical for me. I was more interested in personal stories, instead of statistic facts from the government. Cold & impersonal. Reads like a professor wrote it for a class assignment."
1,A GOOD EFFORT BUT.....,"Like most books written by a non-addict/alcoholic, Happy Hours has a lot of good information but really doesn't help someone who is struggling with recovery. Doctors, therapists, anyone who studies alcoholism but is not suffering from the disease themselves can only understand alcoholism in theory; they will never have a true grasp on the disease itself, no matter how close they are to someone who does. I believe the author has done her homework and indeed her statistics bear this out but unfortunately, to truly understand the terrible grip of addiction, one must be suffering from it. This is an illiness that is most successfully treated by counselors and therapists who are in recovery because they have been in the trenches and know the path we walk and the struggles we face. I do not recommend this book to anyone who is new in recovery and is looking for a guide to follow. A good addition to your collection if you already have a head start with some basic beginngers books"
1,Another unfortunate representation,"As much as America needs a real understanding of the Indochina conflict, this work falls drastically short. The sources sighted are the typical biased rationalizations void of depth and understanding. Anyone with an elementary wish to finding truth in mid to late twentieth century Indochina has merely to check whether actual primary participants were used in the construction of this work. Clearly, they were not. As an examination of American political decision making it may have certain merit. It is however impossible to gain a full understanding of the decisions without knowledge of the depth of the situations. This book does not do that. Clips taken out of context from the FRUS (Foreign Relations of the United States) compilations are not a substitute for scholarly research. This work is long on pages, but short on understanding."
5,Wonderful addition,"For those that appreciate the culinary treasures of SE Asia, I highly recommend this book. This is a quality work that is worth the extra price. Truly a must have for your collection."
2,Doesn't look as pictured,"It doesn't look as bold, substantial and shiny as the picture. It's more dull, somewhat like brushed metal, and thinner. Nice ring overall, though. But don't expect too much."
2,Very disappointing,"I too was lured into purchasing this book because of the over-the-top recipes but that actually proved to be the downfall. After trying out several I gave up on this book because they either were too hard, didn't work out or were just OK. I made the Carrot Cake twice and it ended up just falling apart both times when I took it out of the pan. And this was after about an hour & 1/2 in the kitchen. Other things like the Flourless Fudge Brownies were way too sweet & rich and made me a little sick to my stomach. I consider myself an experienced baker and there are so many other books which are more helpful and less of a waste. Try the Cake Bible or Betty Crocker books."
4,delicious!,"After reading other readers' reviews I feel compelled to come to this book's defense. Yes, my yellow cake came out dry also. However, I cannot imagine more delicious coconut cake, citrus fruitcake, blondie brownine, or flourless brownie recipes. Friends and family always request these favorites. Some recipes can be compicated, but give this book a chance - you won't regret it."
1,"Poorly written, wasteful","I've tried two cake recipies from this book, the carrot cake and the german chocolate cake, and threw both out after hours of work. The cover says ""easy-to-prepare,"" but these recipies are so poorly written that they require the cook to figure out a strategy. For example, the carrot cake doesn't mention that you need to prep the carrots, apple, yam, and pineapple ahead of time. Your batter could sit for 1/2 hr while you prepped these ingredients. The recipies are also wasteful. I threw out 2/3 of the oversweet frosting, which took 40 minutes to make and called for 2 pounds of confectioner's sugar. The german choc cakes were flat and the frosting goopy. Don't waste your time with this book."
3,A Dissapointment!,"I was very excited when I added this book to my cookbook collection. I went to this book to search for a special dessert for a special occasion and was very dissapointed with the results. I chose to prepare the ""Chocolate Espresso Cheesecake"" and boy what a waste of time! I followed the instructions to a tee and used exactly the ingredients it called for. I was so excited to make this incredible-sounding cheesecake. Well, it was awful. It was bitter and almost tasteless. Nobody liked it. It was left on almost everybody's dessert plates! I went back and checked the recipe many times to make sure I didn't miss anything since the author raves and raves about this cheesecake, but I did everything right. What a total dissapointment. I haven't made anything else from this book because I don't want to get burned again. I give it three stars because I only tried 1 recipe from the book. (I was tempted to give zero stars)."
1,Don't waste your money....,"I bought this dvd about a year after it came out. Why??? I don't know what the hell I was thinking. Her videos are uninteresting. She can't dance worth sh-t. She has the vocal ability of a wet mop. Her ""Live"" performance was wonderful to watch--on mute. Sorry baby girl, but YOU AIN'T GOT A DAMN THING ON INDIA!!!!! ."
1,disappointing,"Although I am a fan of Brenda K. Starr's work I have to say this DVD is very disappointing. There are no special features, the interviews with Brenda K. Starr between each video don't have subtitles so unless you speak her language you will have no idea what she is talking about.Also, the singles featured in this package are sung in Spanish. None of her American hits are here - I was hoping for the videos for ""What You See Is What You Get"", ""I Still Believe"" and ""Breakfast In Bed"". There is a version of ""I Still Believe"" on this DVD, but unfortunately not the original. It's some jazzed up salsa version which is nowhere near as beautiful as the original.Overall a very disappointing DVD. Looks like it was rush-released."
4,The Whole Package,"Everything was included in this songbook. From vocals to instrumentals, it was right on the dot, never varying from what one hears on the CD's. The only complaint I have was that it was not spiral bound. Trying to play and turn the page was difficult because the book was bound so tightly."
3,Not up to par with its predecessor,"I bought this book because I loved Gelb's book by the same title (not the workbook). I was mildly dissapointed. My advice, skip the workbook and read How to Think Like Leonardo Da Vinci again!"
4,Faced Paced World,"The world is moving at a fast pace and I find that people are just thinking and not thinking about what they are thinking. This book gives you a chance to return to basic principles of continuous learning and self improvement. It makes you ask the questions - How do I lead? Who is my mentor. Where am I going? What will I leave behind? Am I making a difference or just going through the motions. At some point in everybody's life (just about) these questions pop up. This book presents the information in a creative, easy, and fun way. You also have a chance to learn more about Leonardo da Vinvi (a plus in it's self)."
1,Sad,This is very sad book with little merit. A perfect example of an author scamming the reading public. I wish there was some kind of publishing board that could review books and prohibit some from being published.
1,A cruel book about a cruel crime,"This is the kind of book which gives true crime writing a bad name, indeed I feel that this book is a mere tabloid version of the Shanda Sharer murder case, only it is longer than most tabloid papers. Ms Jones spends too much time delving into the undoubtedly unsavoury backgrounds of Loveless and Tackett, yet shamefully devotes precious few pages to the victim, Shanda, or her family, and what little space that is devoted to Shanda depicts her as a twelve year old tramp who deserved to meet the horrific fate that she did! A much better book about this case is ""Little Lost Angel"" by Michael Quinlan. Skip this book written by Ms Jones and read Quinlan's book instead. It's much better value for money and is written in a far more even handed and compassionate manner."
3,Obsessed,"Before reading Cruel Sacrifice, I read Little Lost Angel many times. I find Cruel Sacrifice slightly dissapointing. I think so because the author has too much information about Melinda Loveless. The book should go into detail more about how the murder came about, then Melinda's childhood life. Therefore I would suggest Little Lost Angel to those wanting to read about Shanda Sharer's murder."
2,ANOTHER INEPT TRUE CRIME NOVEL>>>>>>>>>,"True crime requires a deft touch.Its too easy to blindly report facts garned from other sources (court transcripts,previously published newspaper accounts etc) and it seems Ms.jones,lacking that touch did just that.Her toneless,detached account makes me wonder if she interviewed anyone associated with the case or even bothered to visit the towns the girls were from or where the crime took place or just copied ""facts"" from other sources.This type of novel is sadly all too common in the true crome genre as hack journalists look to cash in on a sensational,""gossipy"" crime.I know there can only be one Ann Rule but its no excuse for this lurid albeit boring,shoddy book.This case was so intense it required more than Aphrodite Jones could give in such a short,disjointed illy written effort.The victim deserves better as does the reader.A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.........."
1,A defense for murderers,"If you want to read a book that excuses four teenagers for brutally murdering a helpless child, this is the book for you. For page after page you will be treated to their sob stories: Melinda was molested by her father, Laurie's mother was a wacko religious fanatic, Toni was raped and the police didn't do anything about it, Hope's family life was turbulent. And all this is supposed to excuse torturing a twelve year old girl, then burning her alive. This isn't a book about the horrible crime that was committed against Shanda Sharer, it's an attempt to ""explain"" the actions of her murderers. In my opinion, a better choice would be ""Little Lost Angel"". This version acknowleges the problems the girls faced but places the blame with Melinda, Toni, Laurie and Hope, where it belongs, and gives the sympathy to poor little Shanda and her family."
4,Drunken White Trash Begets Evil White Trash,"When I initially read about this murder, I thought, ""Oh...Southern Indiana...that explains it."" So much weirdness goes on along the Ohio River, I doubt 1/100 of it gets discovered, much less reported. But having read this story, I am amazed that anyone could be capable of such absolute depravity, lack of empathy, and sheer absence of conscience, regardless of the drunken trashiness in their family backgrounds. I pray that my little daughter never runs into anyone like these horrible ghouls, and also that they never get released, 'cause it's clear they have no concept that they did anything wrong."
2,SAD,"Just another attempt to over analize murderers.I must respond to a reviewer on here ...What I can not stand is the bashing of victims families like you did.""Rot in Hell"" is such a horrible thing to say to Miss Loveless huh?They are words of a mother who lost a child.I see you feel nothing for her loss but feel so bad poor Melinda because she had to hear a few bad words....poor baby."
3,A whole lot of facts,"While this is in my opinion one of the most fascinating subjects for a true crime novel, this book is a pretty pedestrian coverage of it. Really, if it were covering something less compelling, it wouldn't be worth reading. However it is the better of the two books written about this crime.The problem is it just summarizes newspaper stories and court testimony. The author was not able to interview any of the four killers. So this book really adds nothing that an astute follower of the case wouldn't know anyway. Its sources limited, it then settles for merely summarizing the court testimony for hundreds of pages, not doing much outside work to tie everything together, we're just kind of stuck with the stuff that was said in court. Compared to the greats of true crime, this book really leaves a lot to be desired."
3,About Melinda?,"I was slightly disappointed with this book. Supposed to be about the murder of Shanda Sharer, and it almost seemed a biography of Melinda Loveless. It was almost as if Aphrodite was trying to rectify Melinda's actions by proving her home life wasn't too great. I would suggest reading Little Lost Angel, because it tells a more rounded story of how the murder was premeditated and happened. It also wasn't just about Melinda, but about everyone that was involved.."
3,Tragic Story,"I must say that Aphrodite Jones did an amazing job covering this horrid story. Shanda Sharer was a 12yr. old girl who had been kidnapped and bludgeoned to death by four teenage girls. Some parts of this book are very graphic and at times I felt sick to my stomach. What happened to Shanda Sharer should not have happened, but hopefully, every parent who reads this novel will pay attention to the ""warning signs"" their children exhibit. Had the parents of these four girls payed attention, this sensless tragedy could have been avoided."
3,Lazy read,"It's a lazy, easy read. Personally, I love any kind of crime story and it was extremely interesting... poorly written though."
5,Great Book,"I first got into true crime 2 years ago. This was the first true crime book that I read. The most graphic, detailed, and heart-stopping book I have ever read. I didn't put it down for two days and was absolutely shocked that these young girls could do such a horrible thing. I have a two year-old daughter and I will never put her in a public school now, because of these murders. I hope Melinda and her friends never see daylight and burn forever in Hell. If these books do anything, it is to open your eyes and show you this is not such an innocent world..."
1,Tabloid Book,"For me the book was hard to read only because I felt I was reading an extended version of your super market tabloids. I really think if she had taken her time instead of rushing it to press, the book could have been better. A few mistakes on names and locations but nothing to get in a twist over. ""Little Lost Angel"" by Michael Quinlan is a better book because he took his time with the craftmanship of his. I'm familiar with the case because it happened in my hometown and I was at every day of the hearings during this time as was Mr. Quinlan. Miss Jones was not at one of those. She would have done well to go through the court transcripts more carefully."
3,Cruel Sacrifice- a powerful book,"When i first started to read Cruel Sacrifice i couldn't put it down. The things the Loveless family had to endure, it would make anyone cry. The torture the little girls were put through by their own father were horrible, and Aphrodite Jones has written the book so well that you could almost feel the breath of the drunk man on your neck. She really takes you into the book itself with her and shows you all the details of the incident. I would recomend this book to anyone of the age of thirteen and older, and I would read it again. This book is very powerful with the way you think. After i read half of the book i started to reall appreciate my family a little more and really think, this happens everyday. It is a great book."
2,"Unfortunately, not even close to a prequel","While Voyeur , a book with green cover was stand alone fun-filled weird comedy, Voyeurs INC part one , two and three explore pathological personalities and are much more shocking and bizarre . For some it is advantage, for me disadvantage . There is no humor like in the first book that started it all (green cover , Hideo Yamamoto's VoyeUR without s at the end.)NOT FOR KIDS!!!"
4,Good Darth Maul.,"Not sure why I bought this so many years ago, but it still has held up over the years. Good quality and stands well.No issues this this action figure."
4,Adorable in our son's baseball themed room,"They look and feel durable, and they're really cute. The only downside is that they are a bit harder to grab a hold of than the normal drawer pulls that came with the dresser. There is no space between the ball and the wood drawer front, so you have to grab the ball itself, instead of grabbing hold behind the drawer pull...don't know if that makes sense, but when you have a baby in your hands, little inconveniences become bigger problems sometimes."
4,08 Nissan Rogue,"This is the blade only, two to a box. These are lower quality than stock, with a plastic spine and end caps. It is the right size for the rear wiper, but you need to break off the plastic end cap. Since most stores only sell entire wiper assemblies that you don't need, this is about the only option left in these oddball sizes."
5,"Chang's playing delights, but be careful . . .","Sarah Chang's playing of the Prokofiev Violin Concerto No. 1 is exciting, uplifting, at times risky, and always radiant. It's as if someone forgot to teach her the necessary limitations and traditional contraints of her instrument. Or maybe she just ignored them. That is the wonderful news awaiting you in this recording.The thing to be careful about is that playing like hers will you make aware all over again of how the playing of many a big-name violinist may be wholly adequate and even inspired, but not really much fun to listen to."
5,Very good price and product arrived quickly.,"Unlike many sellers who offer a product at a low price, and then make their money on ""shipping"", this was both inexpensive and low shipping fee. Good, new batteries, fast delivery."
4,Genuine Blackberry battery,"This is the same battery that came with my Blackberry. Like the original, it never shows fully charged, but I'm guessing that is a phone issue,not anything to do with the battery. Seemed like a steal of a deal at the price. Arrived promptly."
2,Wobbly,"I had that feeling a person has when they are nearby watching as an infant take his or her first steps, when i entrusted the stand to spare my les paul standard a good fall to the floor. I thought ""well, this is a really heavy guitar; i'll try the Ibanez S5470."" I had the same feeling I felt earlier -- fear for the safety of my guitar. You would have to be quite the physicist/engineer with the patience of Job to find a position that I would feel ensured the safety of my guitars.Oh, and I tried the stand on both carpeted and tiled floors and it had the same poor performance. It is constructed well and would hold the guitars if the rear support was longer -- it's stubby."
1,Cheap,"Husband doesn't like it, so our toddlers use it for their little guitar. Perfect for a child.I don't recommend for a full size guitar"
3,does what it should,"When I first started using this stand I was concerned as the moveable parts move and swivel very easily...I was afraid it would be prone to letting the guitar fall. I guess my fears were unfounded...my guitar has been stored on this for over a month without being knocked off. On the other hand I have it on the side of a room that doesn't get much foot traffic, so it has not been knocked into much, if at all."
5,guitar stand,great the best and cheapest out there.... but one minor thing i dont like is that they didnt even bother to ship it until i filed a complaint.
4,Review,"This piece of equipment is simply what it is for. Cheap and affordable, usability is perfect except one, the bottom part of the stand keeps coming out, that was my only problem, but other than that, it's perfect."
1,Should have been published as a scholarly article,"I was looking for a book to help me understand what happened to my brother who killed himself on methamphetamine. This book did not answer that question. It is a sociological study of meth addicts from the LA area with attention to their social background and potential for violence. It has some interesting statistics, but it comes to some unwarrented conclusions, namely that methamphetamine did not make people violent if they were not already violent for some other reason. This conclusion is based on interviews with the addicts. Nobody asked the wives and girlfriends of these addicts whether they were violent or not, and only 6% of the sample was incarcerated, which is NOT representative of the meth abusing population. I found it inadequate both for information for the general public and as a scholarly work."
4,Retribution Road,"I thought this was a good description of a real outlaw and his close knit family. It was entertaining, it depicted good against evil. It also showed that a person's past can have direct bearing on his future. Some have said it stole its plot from High Noon, however I didn't have that impression.It was obviously a low budget film and could have used more people in the back ground to make seem like a real town.With this said, I enjoyed the film and that is the goal of the producers or should be.As usual, Amazon is a good place to find otherwise little known films."
4,Not what it looks like,"I'm afraid this one runs a risk of being misunderstood. If you judge it as straight narrative it is indeed weak. But that's not its purpose. Rather it is an attempt, mostly successful, at social history beyond narrative. Read it with an ear for the detail: how the women's vote kept the Christian Democrats in power; how average civilian lifespan in Britain actually increaed during World War I-- and the wonderful bit about the disappearing wristwatch under the made-up red flag. He's also good at the shrewd aside: how we know more about the lives of 17 people around Gordon Square than of all of Serbia. As a title, ""Fragments"" is perhaps a confession more than a boast; Vinen does not always keep control of his material. But many of his fragments are too good to be missed."
3,Aahhh maby not,"This figuer has great collectters value but for such a great carecter ( maby my faverit ) they could have done better, and compared to the famed battle droid it seams like a rock. I don't think you could dent this thing with a hammer soooo i think that Hasbro could have done better and the fact that you can hardly move the thing.. ahhhh.. I got it and over all im a litle disaponited but me being a collecter and Qui-Gon being one of my favrit carecters from the move ahhhh give it a shot. Cool thing about it is that he holds his light saber so nicely that it makes a good stand still but for fighting your moveing HIM , not his arm."
2,Waste of Plastic,"Who is this rat suppsoed to be? The sculpt on this figure looks lousy. It is by far the worst in the new line. Somehow Hasbro has turned Liam Neeson into a rat-like person. If it weren't for the poseability, this figure would be a complete loss."
3,NOT VERY GOOD!,"This isnt really good because it only comes with a lightsaber,i got it from pippins in austraila,qld clayfield it was allready opened and in a little plastic bag with the wrong chip!!!!!!!! it was the qui-gon naboo chip,dont they know what there doing ,i possiby think this is the worst episode i figure!"
5,Cool toys!,Well all of the Star Wars toys are cool but I must say that all the people from America that have given reviews for anything on your site have absolutly rubbish english and spelling abilities. They should stick to their toys!
5,Qui-Gon Jinn,This toy is great because it is allot of fun. Collect Darth Maul and Obi Won Kenobi and you have a battle scene to create.
4,To appreciate you must understand the world of Boo and Baa,"My 2-year-old daughter owns every Boo and Baa book and she loves them all. Just tonight as the lights went out she wanted to know what happened to the ant on Boo's sandwich, a la ""Boo and Baa in the Woods."" Through her delight for these sheep I have learned that they are great models of cooperation, optimism and good humor. Frankly the humor went over my head until she showed me the light. Captivating simple stories for two-year-olds. Buy them!"
1,Pretty bad - check out Feinstein instead,"I love tennis and 1990 was a terrific year in that it threw up eight different Grand Slam champions in the 4 slams. It saw the breakthrough of Sampras, vulnerability in Graf, history for Martina, Sabatini's lone moment of Grand Slam glory, the arrival of Capriati and cementing of Seles, a feel-good shock victory for Gomez and the third consecutive Wimbledon final between Becker and Edberg. But this book doesnt capture it. The interviews are uneven but the reporting even more so. The author has travelled to Leimen and Vastervik, but not to much avail. Read John Feinstein's Hard Courts instead - amazingly covering the same year, but showing us all how its done. Disappointing."
2,Sloppy and pretentious,"Berry reaches for the literary high ground, but he stumbles on endlessly repeated imagery and numerous stunning errors of fact. He's obviously interested in his topic, and perhaps a less confident writer would have paid closer attention and gotten the details right."
3,Poor choices...,"lead to poor outcomes. A man errs and the end is almost ordained. Nothing heroic, the reader feels little for the characters and is unmoved by the rescue of survivors. It could have gone otherwise and the reader doesn't care."
2,fine basis for a story but . . .,Too much of the tale is told inside T's head. Too little happens. I found the ending a let down; everything was tied up too neatly. It would have been far more interesting if the drug dealer had found them.
5,A Must have book for photographer..,"This book is the best proof that says ""Picture speaks louder than word"". I was at the photo exhibition for the M.I.L.K project at the NYC Grand Central station and was totally amaze and impress by these photograhs. That's why i bought this book the next day itself. These are pictures taken not only by professionals but also by many amature who did wonderful works! Every single pictures in the book or exhibition speak for itself. A truly great wedding gift or just a plain coffee table book."
5,Beautiful Book of Moments,"I really liked this book! Very special to look through with loved ones, and a cool coffee table book. Only wish it was longer! Bought a used one (much less expensive) and I will keep it forever."
5,drew tears to my eyes,"the book makes me re-look at my life, the images will reach deep into everyone's heart.photographers from all over the world captured thatmoment...expression...joy....i am very glad i found this gem"
2,Had to return them,"I thought these boots liked nice online, but they're disappointing in person. The inside looks like styrofoam, and the leather was already wrinkled when I got them. They also fit like a 9 or a 9.5. The wool is nice but they were very unimpressive overall and would definitely let snow in around the ankles."
5,Love this book,"Serene, powerful and thought provoking, the photos in this book will move and inspire you. I bought one copy for myself and one as a gift for a guy because the girl on the cover looks very much like me."
3,A Nice Book,"A nice book with some interesting information. I think my only real complaint about the book is that it seems to generalize a lot of what paganism before the modern era believed and did so without any citation or more information. Another annoying thing is that the constant use of animal dictionaries for meanings and symbolism everywhere throughout the book for everything. One thing I do like about this book is that it goes kind of go into some interesting new territory with using animal magic and animal imagery. Besides just talking about totems and spirit guides it also using animal remains, animal symbolism, and even some animal-based feng shui. Overall, a nice introduction book though it does have a few problems to me."
3,Just average. Unispired and unoriginal.,"As an avid chef and artisan who creates my own decorative olive oil bottles, I am immersed in the olive and olive oil culture and I have to say I expected more from this book considering the McEvoy ranch's reputation. I thought the recipes were uninspired and unoriginal and nothing I hadn't seen somewhere before. Who needs a recipe for mashed potatoes or lemon roasted chicken? If you are looking for more unique fare, I would suggest you check out Mustards Grill by Cindy Pawlcyn. In there you will find recipes for butternut squash and goat cheese risotto and salmon roulade with kalamata olive, orange and celery relish.Beth Powandawww.impressedglasswaredesigns.com"
5,LA RELACION MONSTRUOSA ENTRE UNA,"MUJER QUE AMA Y SU VERDUGO..Su maridoSu páreja, que la va destruyendo día por día, desmembrando su dignididad como persona, su amor propio...Ella misma no cpomptendebque estanpasando, donde quedo aquel hombre extraordinario con el que se caso y que se ha convertido en un individuo agresivo, duro, golpeador física y / o emocionalmente.Este libro LA HACE COMPRENDER Y LUCHAR."
5,Best book I have read about secure software,"Too many books talk about how to secure a network, and discuss network-based attacks, but this book is different; it covers how to design, build and test the code at the end of the pipe - the application software.The book is complete in its explanation of how to make sure your application code, be it web-based or otherwise, is secured from attack.I learned a great deal from this book, and, based on code and design reviews of my company's code, the authors obviously know what they are talking about - as we made a lot of fixes, and added many new security test cases to our test suites.Simply put, we never knew we had problems, until we read this book, now it's mandatory reading for all our software engineers."
2,Should be Microsoft Secure Code,"I agree with a previous reviewer that the title is misleading - it should emphasize that this is primarily a book about not writing non-secure code on a Windows platform.There are many good tips in the book (which is why it didn't get one star), but for those of us who write code for other platforms (there are other platforms, BTW) it's not nearly as useful.The final example of non-usefulness are the sample code files. To get them you must download a Windows executable which requires that you click on a button accepting a license agreement; the download will then begin. If you don't happen to be running on a Windows box, no download, no code examples, no nothing. Makes the book way less useful and much more annoying to me."
1,Okay overview,"Okay overview. Not many details good for beginning programmers who are learning how to code right. Not really for understanding windows security or architecture, but then that is not the intention of the book."
5,"Not perfect, but perhaps the best you will get!","This is a wonderful book that covers things that are often glossed over in other security books. For instance, the coverage of access control lists, and the difficulties of controlling them, are well covered. I wish it had more information on the .NET Framework (there are I believe 2 chapters covering .NET security issues) but the editing is clean (something I am a bit of a finatic about) and the writing style is good enough to make this relatively dry topic an enjoyable read."
3,Pretty good...,"This book was prety good. I liked it less after thinking about some of the reviews here. One reviewer has a good point that this is not a book for the hardcore coder. It is more about high-level how to secure-it stuff. Still, I thought the other reviewer had a good point too about SSL. I didn't think about it until after i finished the book, but the topic wasn't covered at all. Is it really something where there are no pitfalls to using it? It's okay not to tell me about the API, but even if SSL doesn't have any problems, i would have at least liked to hear ""use this, it will secure all your network connections, then you won't have to worry about any network attacks"" or something like that."
5,An Excellent Book,"This book tells you the nuts and bolts of secure programming in great detail and explained real well.I especially enjoy the anecdotes, the authors obviously know their stuff and have plenty of experience!This book covers real-world-apps and how to build them based on threats and common security coding mistakes.It's a great book!"
4,Very Complicated,"I had to read through this book a few times, as it is quite complicated - I never really knew there was so much to RPS. I always assumed rock beats everything, but after my second or third reading I started to understand the intricacies of the game. I now choose paper everytime, and my winning rate has increased almost 1%"
4,Good for introductory students,"Garrison's layout of the text is fairly well done so that the text is easily able to be read. The commentary is, generally, useful. There are a few typos or mistakes in it, but the commentary will prove valuable to the intro student. There is sufficient aide for grammatical question and enough cultural explanations to make the book useful. Sometimes Garrison makes references to more modern works, which is less useful, yet still available. If you are a serious reader, you likely know more suitable sources already. Otherwise, for the casual reader or student who is attempting to augment proficiency, this book is useful. Fortunately, Garrison (Ode 1,11) does not fall into common convention to misaddress 'carpe diem' as sieze the day rather than the proper 'pluck the day' in the proper context."
2,One sided and biased,People that are convinced that Gene Leroy Hart was guilty should also know that this book is biased and one sided. New evidence has shown that DNA has failed to link Gene Leroy Hart to this crime.
4,Not Biased - last reader posting uninformed,"Biggest criminal case in Oklahoma history. Acquital of a known rapist who escaped from prison to rape and murdered 3 children (while at a Girl Scout camp). DNA was not available at the time of the murders (late 70s), but a test similar to DNA was done in '89 that shown that the odds were 3 in 5 that Hart did it. DNA was attempted in early '02, but there was not enough to get a result. What did happen was an unethical, Big City defense lawyer (despite being told by the court not to discuss it) told the jury that Hart was already serving 300 years - thus the jury reached a compromised verdict. The DA from Tulsa (Buddy Fallis) came in to the small county to do the case. This case still haunts Buddy to this day and it was his reason for him to leave criminal law altogether. The defense attorney brags about his acquital and uses it to go speak to other defense attorneys on how to perpetrate a fraud on the people (the jury)."
4,Someone Cry for the Children,"It was very interesting to me as a Cherokee and living in the area where the murders occured. I kept an open mind while reading the book without predjudice. The writers did a wonderful job telling the story of their investigation; I didn't want to put it down. It was afterall, the story of their investigation, it doesn't make it an absolute truth. I still don't believe that Gene Hart killed those little girls. No one that I know does, or at least couldn't have done it without help from another person. Rumors and tales still circulate around about who really did kill those girls. The person believed to many, to have actually committed the murders, has passed away. So the mystery still lingers."
1,Watch out for unplayable DVDs from these sellers,"Sadder but wiser, I found another reviewer's warning too late, after naturalsound505 sent me a European DVD of Aznavour and Minnelli. Nowhere on Amazon or Natural Sound's Storefront does anyone tell you they are offering a PAL encoded disc which is unplayable in the US. They do tell you it is for ""all regions"" but as far as US DVD players are concerned, it might as well be a piece of cardboard. My seller quickly offered a refund upon return, but why go to the trouble? E-mail the seller and inquire about the details first! (Update: I asked for format details from Movie Mars, but they ""did not have that information."" Guess what? They sent me another European PAL DVD I can't play which I now have to return. Beware!)"
5,What a great combination?,This DVD is great! I admire both artists I grew up on Aznavour in my native country. It was my farther's favorite artist. Minelli is the best. I jus love her voice. My whole family enjoyed the DVD. It is a good three hours of fine entertainment.
5,Excellent...,"I liked it, and i recommend it to any one who likes selfdefence and close combat. Thank you and enjoy..."
3,Basics Work!,"The basics work. In a street fight or an unarmed combat situation your not going to be kicking five feet in the air and doing spinning heel kicks to the temple. Basics work thats why the marines use them. The street fighter has the upper hand on the marital artist, I've seen black belts get there ass kicked by experianced street fighters. Martial artist are used to rules and regulations, a street fighter does what he has to do and he knows what works in a real fight. When your rage'n with adrenaline and the animal in you takes over. TECNIQUE GOES OUT THE F*CKIN' WINDOW. If you don't beileve me go to a local fight club or talk to your local tough guy.good book. good stuff. good luck fighting."
2,its OK,The book is pretty good if you are not counting on these techniques with your life or If you are a kid and have a bully problem. The book shows some ok techniques but I am not sure they work because I have tried them and they have no effect.
3,"simple, but a good starting point","This book is a good starting manual for basic self, but is not complete enough top be a stand alone guide. The techniques are standard issue military hand to hand, but perhaps a little ""old school"". The unarmed combat is simply a catalog of basic boxing and judo techniques, with basic self defense strikes (palm heel, knife hand, hammer fist, elboews, knees, low kicks), some basic ground fighting maneuvers, and a section of come-along/submission holds. It also includes sections on stick fighting, knife fighting, bayonet techniques and weapon retention. Using it as a starting point for basic techniques is fine."
5,Got a home theater? Buy this now.,"Star Wars Episode II - opening reentry scene. Wow! The Buttkicker really shines. That scene will push you subwoofer to its absolute limits. I sat my brother down to witness this new device but I didn't tell him what to expect and boom. The couch began to vibrate and he was surprised! And when I told him that the subwoofer was unplugged, he was shocked! The Buttkicker was so effective one could consider replacing the sub. Almost! I wouldn't but late at night I can still get the low frequency effects without pissing off my roomate. Dont want to get stabbed in the forehead while I sleep! You know what I mean..."
3,Spring noise,Does not work well with my recliner. There are times when there is too much spring vibration under my recliner. I'm looking to place it under a loveseat or sofa. I think I will like it alot better.
4,All movies are not created equal,"When a movie has a good surround track with adequate LFE you will feel the tremors. Most movies do not have adequate surround tracks, or worse, the levels vary from movie to movie. You will find yourself adjusting the gain up or down or the cutoff up or down to get more or less out of the shaker system. I have had some movies bottom out the shakers and with the same setting the next movie has little to no LFE unless the gain is cranked.I wish there was an auto tune or some other setup signal (done automatically) on the intro of each movie such that your surround system and shakers could be set appropriately.The effect you get is mild shaking. Some movies have it just for explosions, others for elephants or large animals walking. I have seen 2 movies where the shaking is continous when the scene is inside a space ship or helicoptor ... when you hear the engine noise, you can feel it as if you were inside."
5,Transformed my home theater experience!,"Regardless of your nice high-end home theater speaker system this piece of equipment will give you an experience you won't get otherwise. The transducer isn't just a generic vibrator. This unit modulates the vibration to perfectly match what you hear. It isn't just a 'shaker' for your couch. Vibrations are transmitted with great accuracy as far as frequencies go. Watching Band of Brothers, Mission Impossible 3, Saving Private Ryan, and many more with this unit has been something out of this world. It makes you feel like you are there in the action. Explosions in movies, a tank just passing by, a door being slammed shut, you name it, and this thing makes you feel like you are there when it was being filmed. I highly recommend it! I'm a happy camper. The immersion factor goes up quite a few notches."
5,Make your home theater stand out,"I have left this item on my wishlist for about 2 years just because I didn't know anyone else who had this if I had any problems. If you can operate your subwoofer then you can use this. I love the fact the ""shaker"" is almost virtually indestructible, it lets me know I can be rest assured if I want to demo things on the spot. Be the one person on your home theater block to have this. This is a home theater owners wet dream!!!"
3,It's good but....,"This book starts off really good with a great story about interviewing with a Consulting firm, but it ends up being a book about the author during his ""glory days"". It's interesting. Gives a few insights, but nothing earth-shattering is in this book. Buy it Used or check it out from the library!"
3,"interesting points, but in need of editing","Postives-makes many valid points about greed and unscrupulousness in consulting and the toll it takes on both people who work for the industry and companies that hire these firms-gives helpful interview advice for people interested in working for these firms ;-)-section about living in Japan before starting a consulting life v. interestingNegatives-self-righteous attitude--he works as a lawyer and used to live in a fraternity--not to stereotype, but I'm sure anyone who has been in both places has seen, perhaps not necessarily participated in, A LOT more than Pinault details in his book-long rants about issues which may have personal significance but fail to advance plot (ex: weight loss working in singapore office, ex-wife's English class). Ironically, these anecdotes showcased the author's social ineptitude more than revealing anything about consulting."
5,QUISQUEYA LA BELLA--*A SOLID CONTRIBUTION*,Quisqueya la Bella is a solid contribution to the understanding of the Dominican Republic today. It helps to close the existing gap concerning in-depth analysis in English of both the Dominican people and the socioeconomic problems that currently afflict Dominican society. Both deserve a wide audience...The author's text is generally passionate and committed...Cambeira sets out the shed light on the understanding of the Dominican mind.New West Indian Guide Vol. 73 no. 1&2
2,Far from the masterpiece the reviews claim !!,"The Dominican Republic in Historical and Cultural Perspective (Perspectives on Latin America and the Caribbean) by self-proclaimed master writer Alan Cambeira is far from the masterpiece the glowing reviews claim this book to be. I found the book predictable, boring, and just average."
5,great scale easy to use,I use this for preparing my luggage for air travel. It helps me to not put too much weight in the luggage and pay excess baggage fees.
5,Wonderful product,I purchased this scale a few weeks ago and am very happy with it. The customer service was the best part...outstanding!
1,DO NOT BUY THIS SCALE!!,"This scale is ALWAYS off by at least 5 ounces.. Own a mail order business and finally just threw this piece of junk in the trash, got tired of getting calls from my customers informing me that they had to pay extra postage.. DO NOT BUY!!!!"
3,"Nice, But Don't Take It Lightly","This scale is almost perfect for my shipping needs, with one small exception. It weighs the heavier items I ship but smaller items still have to be weighed on my postage scale. Smaller items either are too light to register on the scale, or the scale gives a weight that is not accurate, which I discoverd when I took items to the Post Office and found I owed more postage.That said, the bulk of my shipping needs will weigh fine on this scale, but if you ship a lot of small stuff under a pound, this scale is not for you."
4,150 pound digital shipping scale,"After wasting time going store to store for a scale, I finally found this one on line. (why didn't look here first?) It is perfect for the different box sizes we ship. The digital numbers are easy to read and the cord allows you to move the unit making it easier to see."
2,Digital Scale,"I am a dog breeder and I bought this scale to weigh my puppies daily. At first I thought this was a pretty accurate scale, but when I took the puppies for their first exam and weighed each puppy on the vet's scale, this scale was actually not accurate at all.I know it is meant for a postage scale, but truly, a scale is a scale and should be accurate!"
3,Scale is a little off...,"I purchased this scale upon reading the reviews and I have found that the scale is off by .25 ounces on the weight. How do I know you ask? Well I took a verified 4 pound object and put it on the scale and it weighed in at 3.75lbs. Off by .25 ounces. No real big deal. I just add .25 to whatever I weigh. The pluses are that it runs on a 9 volt battery, the adapter came packaged with it, a reasonable price, and it is a cool looking digital scale.But having it off by .25 (not knowing if this is going to be an ongoing issue - meaning will it be off by .50 in a few months?) and not having it have a pure control setting that where I can manually set the scale to exact zero if there are weight variances is the reason that I have given it 3 stars."
4,"Fun and Humorous Overview of the ""Universe"" - Despite Some Minor Errors","I enjoyed this book. As a life-long fan of astronomy, I found this to be a good general review. It is certainly not mind-blowing by any means, but it is a good review of the history of astronomy, the scientists who developed astronomy into a specific science, and then facts and general knowledge about the solar system, the galaxy, the stars, and our universe. For someone who wants an enjoyable read (he is able to write with lots of tongue-in-cheek humor), on general astronomy, this is a great starting point. I like how the subjects are broken down into questions, which are then answered. This breaks down the book into readable portions. Mr. Davis explains astronomy concepts so that the lay reader will easily comprehend his answers.There are some factual errors in the book, but these are minor and do not detract from the book's appeal as a source of knowledge on astronomy.kone"
3,Great for the novice,Great read if you're just starting out. I did however find Mr. Davis' book alittle preoccupied with trivial tidbits about acomplishments in the space industry. I would have liked for there to have been more written about modern discoveries and theories on the nature and origin of the universe.
3,You Don't Want to Know about Kenneth Davis.,"Kenneth Davis' ""Don't Know Much About..."" books are fun and interesting. There are occasional factual errors, so use his works to get an overview or refreshment of the subject, and don't rely too heavily on specific historical anecdotes. But I recommend reading, not listening. Davis has a penchant for droning on about himself, his critique of the schools, and his own philosophy of learning. When doing so, he is verbose and repetitive. With a book, you can skim over his homilies and get to the data points. Unfortunately, you can't do that with an audiocassette or CD. In addition, the charts and lists he puts in his books are fine when you can view them, but they don't come through well when he reads them to you. I recommend skipping the cassettes or CDs -- try the books."
4,Better than Nuttin!,"Contrary to the other 2 reviews, I thought this did exactly what I hoped. This is a simple review -- okay, simplistic review -- of the universe, but I was barely 8 when I last had any formal instruction about the vastness of the heavens. I have managed to be successful in my life in spite of this dereliction, but now in the comfort of an easy chair with a cigar and glass of cab for company, I can finally learn that some guy in 300 some-odd BC calculated the earth's circumference to within a couple hundred miles. My kids knew that, of course -- probably from some video game -- but it was a wowie for me. So what if Davis doesn't know how to spell Polish names. I am not trying out for a spot on the next Mars mission. This may not be a scholarly work, but it's a good read."
4,"Good, But Not Great","Overall, I liked this book more than many of the other reviewers. Sure, there are some factual errors (enough to drop my rating down to 4 stars), but Davis gets his facts right 9 times out of 10. The material is broken up in a very logical manner, and the questions Davis chooses to pose, then answer, form a cohesive overview of the subject.I think anyone with enough interest in the subject to consider reading this book will come away fairly satisfied with what is delivered. Recommended."
5,Well Made Bag,This bag fits my Macbook 15.4 laptop perfectly. This bag is sturdy and very well made.
4,"Great premise, decent effort","Unlike the other reviewers, I liked this book. My biggest problem with it is its length. After hearing a few of the stories, it started to get a bit dull.In a nutshell, this book is about people who have the money, power and lack of ethics to avoid paying their taxes. The result, of course, is that the rest of us have to make up the hundreds of billions of dollars lost.This is muckraking in the best sense of the word. This book follows a middle class self-employed taxpayer through the bureaucratic hell caused by bad IRS advice, and her resulting tax bill and then contrasts it with the treatment big-time tax evaders get. If you are an ordinary person, the IRS will go after you. If you can afford fancy lawyers, the IRS is willing to compromise on pennies for the dollar.This book is a better skim than a read, but it's an important message and the authors have clearly put a lot of work into it."
2,TEASER,"I WROTE A SEMI REVIEW OF THIS BOOK FOR THE LOCAL PAPER, I DID NOT MENTION THAT IT WAS A TEASE IN THAT IT FELL SHORT OF MUCH ACTUAL FACTUAL MATERIAL ON A PER CASE BASIS. NOT SURPRISING CONSIDERING THE SECRECY INVOLVED. EVERYONE SHOULD SUPPORT MUCKRAKERS, IT IS THE ONLY SUPPORT FOR HONOR.DNB"
4,SOULED AMERICAN!,"TAVARES/THE BEST OF TAVARES: New Bedford, Massachusettes' soul slingin' siblings TAVARES enjoyed a respectable run of RNB and pop hits in the late 70s, even though their harmonic brand of solid stone soul rose high above the disco label they were sometimes unfairly tagged with. Joyous dancefloor fillers HEAVEN MUST BE MISSING AN ANGEL and the BEE GEES-penned MORE THAN A WOMAN shared chart space with the gritty warning IT ONLY TAKES A MINUTE and WHODUNIT, a nifty novelty that namechecked legendary detectives from CHARLIE CHAN to DIRTY HARRY. Surprisingly, the quintet also effortlessly tackled white rockers, their electrifying versions of the EDGAR WINTER GROUP's FREE RIDE and HALL & OATES' SHE'S GONE damn near toppling the originals. THE BEST OF TAVARES rounds up ten tantalyzing tracks from the me decade sure to agree with most musical tastes.RATING: FIVE BROTHERS"
3,John Wayne Supports Buck Jones in Well-Done Western,"Here's the Duke, in another Columbia support role, but this time he has a little more time on camera. Buck Jones is the star, as well he should be, and he plays the local sheriff whose foster brother (Wayne) is accused of killing his girl friend's father. Buck works to exonerate him in this well-done B-Western"
4,doing good so far,we inherited an old grill with a grate that was rusted in the middle so we always cooked around the edges to avoid massive sticking. boy was i excited to find a perfect after market replacement grate that fits our grill exactly. it's gotten a whole bunch of use this summer and seems to be holding up well. i wipe the grate with a paper towel soaked in canola oil before each use to help avoid sticking.
5,You are your soul,"While in medical school I realized the body is nothing without the soul and started reading about the soul being the intricate part of you. While the body changes,the soul continues with you as seen by Ms. Caldwell's experiences. Why do you recognize certain places and dislike certain people? Is deja vu an imprint from a past life? That is with what this book tantalizes us.A completely objective evaluation of Ms.Caldwell's past lives lets us to think that we are a compilation of our past."
3,Roudybush Rice Diet,"While Roudybush has excellent products,there is too much hype concerning this product and it is very overpriced when taking into consideration the regular price of their product.The product did not make any difference in my birds health..I have over 40 birds.I was worried that one or two birds may need the rice instead of the regular soy formulas because soy does interfere with Calcium absorption....didnt make one difference in those two birds,and in a flock feeding situation,I had to feed them all this product.I will be switching back to the regular.:"")"
1,Dim,"This bulb is not as bright as a comparable 60 Watt flood. When replaced next to the older (60 watt) bulb, the difference is obvious."
5,The best muffin cookbook ever... except for the sequel!,"You can count on all the recipes in this book being tried and true. My copy is held together by a rubber band because I use it so much. The corn muffin recipe makes the best I've ever had (I add just a little extra sugar, and sometimes use buttermilk) and the cappuccino chip muffins are fantastic (try adding toffee chips). Be sure to try the new ""More Muffins"" as well as the other books in the series -- Totally Teabreads, Simply Scones, etc. All are reliable."
1,Bad Book + Website = $$$$,"After reading this book, I'm perplexed. A few ""so-called"" financial advisors recommend it highly, yet I found it rather weak. I also work in finance for a living and have done so for much of my life. As for the reader who says if financial people all knew so much, they'd all be rich, he's right, many of them are. But not because of following the advice in this book. Probably because a few of them have you buy a poor written book, link you to a dubious website, and cash in membership fees...It's so bad, it would seem that the authors are either writing their own reviews or having their friends write them. I found myself mortified to have bought this book, save your money and search the web for real-world advice."
5,Very helpful,"I found this book very helpful in deciding how to manage my option portfolio. It helped me to think about risk assessment and the assessment of future potential of my options.I really like the practical and useful information in the book. Which options should I exercise first and why? Should I sell or hold...how many and for how long?By using the tip from the book regarding the AMT ""sweet spot"" I found I could exercise a number of ISOs in 2001 without incurring AMT in excess of my normal tax liability. I also used the tip on stock exchanges.Very helpful. Well worth the price."
5,A must have for any collector!,"Judith Miller's illustrated dictionary of antiques and collectibles really is a splendid publication. The pictures are great and the text is very informative. Additionally, rough price estimates are listed for the pieces in the photographs, which I found to be rather helpful. I highly recommend it for any beginning collector or even an experienced one- or really anyone who is simply looking for a nice coffee table book!"
2,Nice but check it first,"I purchased two sets for two different bathrooms. The first one worked well but the second had a broken mixer valve in the hot water side. My plumber checked it before installing it. Since this is an ""OFF"" brand we couldn't get a replacement part. I returned it and went to Home Depot and found something else. It's stylish but I would buy a better name brand in case there is issues in the future."
2,Hmmmm....,"This video was okay...I mean, the basic premise is that of a few other videos out there...it's okay to be sexy. That in itself is great.This video is too similar in alot of ways to The Art of Exotic Dancing for Everyday Women, which is one of my favorites and I've had for years! It just isn't as good.Yes, I was disappointed. I suppose I learned a little bit more than I already knew but it wasn't worth the $20+ ."
5,Very Helpful!,"I found this video very helpful in encouraging me to make friends with my body. I love how the women on the video could be you and me- they're not simply barbie-doll types but real women. The moves are simple and easy to follow. I also love the little tid-bits of information and trivia she gives you along the way. I have seen a few other videos, but none quite like this one- it is a well-needed addition to womens interest videos!! I highly reccommend it to every woman. Thanks so much."
4,Great book!,"Great book, unreal ideas- I use it n my classroom weekly!The book came with writing all over the sides....... I had to white it out."
5,Notebook Know-How is a Gem,"Notebook Know-How: Strategies for the Writer's Notebook is a useful resource for teachers new to notebooks or seasoned veterans. The author, Aimee Buckner, really takes the reader on a journey of the writer's notebook with easy-to-use strategies that are as sound as can be. Always bringing us back to trusting the writing will come and it won't always be good. Really it won't. The part on assessment is inspiring. I really found myself thinking about my own teaching, how I use notebooks, and how I might do it all better. Her writing is magic in how it creates a map of flexibility and specificity without ever preaching. Ralph Fletcher got it right: ""That's the best kind of teacher renewal I can imagine."" I concur."
4,Approachable and Useful,"Previous to reading this text I had only informally used a writers notebook in my fifth grade classroom. This resource has changed that ""informal"" approach. This book shows the teacher how to successfully implement the writers notebook in the classroom, allowing for some individuality for the teacher and student to make it their own. Her specific ideas are quite useful for a beginner, and her laid back style of writing makes the book relate-able and an ""easy"" read."
5,Notebook Know-How: Strategies for the Writer's Notebook,"This is a wonderful book for anyone who is teaching writing at any age. Buckner's approach is teacher friendly and makes sense. It will give you a great way to get your student's writing like ""crazy."" Don't miss out on this one. It will transform your teaching. Her writing lessons are engaging,purposeful, and concise.Cindy ColemanWriting Teacher3-7 grades"

1,Great until they fell off her feet and got lost first time I used them,"I should have listened. Mittens don't stay on dogs' feet, period. These came off the first time I tried them, got lost in the snow, it's over. Nice price, but I had them on snug and they came off. Sigh."
2,cute nut not extreme all weather,"I put these on my chihuahua and once he got used to them could walk ok nut first snow after arrival, he came in shivering. I checked his feet and inside the boots and feet were cold and wet. Boot was cold and wet inside. Dog did not go in deep snow so nothing came in from top of boot."
4,Webkinz Black Lab Product,"This product is easy to buy and makes the perfect toy for any child! It's access to the internet is simple whether you're at the library or at home. Is well for kids of all shapes and sizes along with ages! In the stores, it's a little hectic since the Hallmark that I go to has them behind the counter, and doesn't have a wide variety. I've heard that Webkinz sell fast. Very durable toy. Most of the games on the site are educational, some include hitting little 'Zingoz' with a bat. At Quizzy's the child answers questions based on their age group, which is a positive thing about the site! Overall, it's a well-built product, I just wish that the site had better learning experiences!"
1,"Webkinz customer service is terrible. Shame on you, Webkinz!","If you just want an expensive, cute little stuffed animal, by all means buy away. If you are looking for a nice place on the web for your kids to play, consider that your kids may walk away very frustrated.There is no way to contact Webkinz (that I can find) for the following issues:1) Your child can use up a half hour of their alloted computer time just trying to log on to Webkinz.2) There are many error massages. Most do not make sense. Webkinz technical support offers no support. It basically just blames any problem you are having on your ISP or that your Flash Player is not working (even though it worked yesterday and it will work again tomorrow).3) It sometimes logs your child out right in the middle of a game.My children have simply stopped bothering with Webkinz and have lost interest in their stuffed Webkinz toys."
3,Cute toy poor quality,My son loves this toy. Good thing my wife can sew. Within a week after getting it we noticed one seam coming apart and the fabric was so thin on the belly that it was coming apart.
4,Webkins Wonderful,"This toy was purchased for a 3 year old whose webkins Cocker Spaniel needed a ""friend."" It seems to be very durable and he loves it. Soft, plush, and cute as ever, we welcome this type of dog into our home!"
4,Webkinz Black Lab Review,I bought this for my 13 yr old granddaughter. She loves the Webkinzs and enjoys playing on the Webkinz site. The animals are soft and very well made. I would recommend this and other Webkinz animals to anyone...age dependent on ability to play on line.
5,Cook's Illustrated Pasta and Noodle Cookbook,"This was a pleasant surprise as it was a much thicker book than I had anticipated. It has lots of recipes for every kind of pasta and noodle imaginable, even rice, plus info on how to make pasta, which is why I ordered it. And it is the typical great quality of all Cook's Illustrated materials, with lots of helps and tips. Well worth it!"
5,Great book for pasta lovers,"The Complete Book of Pasta and NoodlesThis book really surprised me. Being of Italian descent, I have always used my own family recipes for pasta and sauces. However, I was surprised to find many of my recipes in this book as well as others that I have always wanted to try. I have already used the recipe for fresh pasta and had very good results. Sauces are grouped into categories like meat, fish and vegetable so it's easy to find what you are looking for. I highly recommend this book."
1,Definitely NOT a Complete Book,While this book may have some good recipes...as far as the pasta itself goes they don't even supply recipes for all that they show pictures of or list. 20-30 pages about noodles itself and 200 or more for sauces.
3,Falls short of 'Complete',"Several reveiwers have done an excellent job reviewing the contents of this book so I won't bore you with my version of that. in hindsight, I really wish I would have spent more time reading the reviews for this book. It turns out that this is not the complete book of pasta. I gave 3 stars because I think it will make an excellent gift to one of the kids as they move out.As I mentioned above it does however have some redeeming qualities, it provides a few basic pasta recipes, definitions, tastetests and pasta to sauce pairings. So for a new or inexperienced home cook that wishes to learn about ingredients and how to shop for and prepare quality pasta dishes this may well be a very good cookbook, but for anyone that cooks and is trying expand their culinary horizon or step up their game in the kitchen I think this book falls short of the mark.Have fun"
3,A little disappointing,"Nowhere in this book does it tell you how long to cook fresh egg pasta. One of the main reasons I bought this book was to help learn how to create my own pasta, so missing something as simple as cooking time for homemade pasta is a disappointment. There is really only about 5 pages dedicated to making homemade egg pasta, this could definitely be expanded to include more detail. Most of the book is recipes for pasta dishes. If you're looking for a basic book on pasta it is ok, although I would recommend Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking as an alternative, seems like some of the pasta making techniques were taken from that book."
2,The Complete Book of Pasta and Noodles,"The book may have good recipes in it, but the cookbook is not fun to look at. The latout is not eye catching. Photos with recipes would have been more attractive."
2,pasta book,The book isn't what I thought it was going to be. I was hoping it would be more recipies on how to make the noodles and pasta from scratch instead of the numerous recipies for already made pasta. not very happy but am keeping the book.
4,Perfect Companion,"I love Cooks Illustrated, and this has some wonderful stuff as well as the tricks and tips that set them appart from on-line sites and other cook books. I got this to go with a pasta maker I received for Christmas, and the only thing I wish this has has the in-depth pictorial that covers making pasta from scratch that is in America's Test Kitchen Family Cook book. Then it would be a 5-star"
5,Will enhance any aspiring chef's abilities,"Comprised of more than 400 diverse and easy-to-follow recipes, techniques and kitchen tips, The Complete Book Of Pasta And Noodles offers clear, concise, step-by-step instructions that make even the most exotic recipes easily accessible to the most novice kitchen cook. Beginning with ""A Guide to Pasta and Noodles"", The Complete Book Of Pasta And Noodles covers every conceivable aspect of pasta and noodle dish preparation. From sauces to lasagne, from ravioli to couscous, from spatzle to soba, The Complete Book Of Pasta And Noodles is a definitive and highly recommended culinary cookbook and guide that will enhance any aspiring chef's abilities to serve delicious, nutritious, noodle and pasta based cuisines."
4,Very thorough book,"all you need to know about making pasta not only italian way but around the world.As usual with Cooks Illustrated, the tests results are worthy and the why cooking that way is better than another explained.The book could be cut in half though, a lot a similar recipes that do not need lengthy description."
5,house wife,the cook books helps in preparing many different types of pastas and helps to show how you can be more creative with future dinners.
2,not for homemade fresh pasta,"This cookbook didn't have many recipes for actually making fresh pasta at home. It gives recipes for store bought pastas. I dont think this book should be ""suggested"" when you purchase a pasta maker/machine"
1,Title fools you,"I purchased this book to learn how to make pasta and noodles, but the only thing in this book is basicly food recipes that use a pasta, doesnt tell you how to make the different pastas. so the title is misleading."
2,"Lots of Sauce Recipes, Not Pasta Recipes","My husband had just gotten a pasta machine that he was anxious to start using. I picked out this pasta cookbook for him. I was expecting lots of pasta recipes, not lots of pasta SAUCE recipes. I took a quick glance at the beginning of the book. It looked like it was what I was wanting to get for him. But I should have looked throgh the entire book more diligently. So, for what we were looking for, this book was a disappointment. We have not used it a single time."
4,Highly Creative,"I believe that Catherine Wishart created a wonderful book to inspired younger woman in their personal search for religion and to better themselves. This was highly creative by using costuming and the like to get in touch with their inner goddess. The only low point is her constant emphasis on getting a boyfriend, body image and the use of Celtic deities. But otherwise a fun study!"
4,GREAT book for technology / history buffs,"I gave this book 4 stars because, while it was refreshing to read and I definitely learned quite a bit, it wasn't a paradigm-shifting book, which is what I am increasingly moving towards for my 5 star books.Having worked in the telecom industry and on Wall Street I can say that this book is a must read for anyone wanting to know about the cellular industry or telecom in general. I found myself having a difficult time putting the book down at various times as the insight from this insider was unbelievable. Frankly I was behind the curve in the wireless sector as far as my history went but this book did an excellent job of getting me up to speed, describing what a wild ride is was in the sector and the book did an amazing job of telling the stories of some interesting characters involved in the wireless industry during its nascent stage."
2,Not for LFE,"It's a known issue around the net that the Buttkicker couch kit does not work well with the LFE version of the Buttkicker. At higher output, the use of the kit causes the LFE transducer to rattle very loud. Mount it directly to your couch.Guitammer should have designed a better mounting kit."
3,It's a textbook...,"...but it's not a bad one. You should know, however, that many physics classes also require access to online homework and materials through WileyPlus; purchasing that access is $65 per book. Just another way for the textbook companies to screw the students.It's not really as if you're going to have a choice as to which physics text you buy, and you should probably be looking for the 8th edition, but this book is pretty good."
2,Overrated,"The book is very overrated. It is obtuse and most of the problems are completely unsolvable based on the information and examples given. It is grossly overpriced. This book is worth maybe $50, and that is pushing it. I get good grades in physics, but not because of this book. If it wasn't for my fantastic instructor, this series of courses would be a total nightmare.The chapters dealing with force, energy, torque, momentum, and angular momentum are among the worst that I have gone through. The optics section is also pretty weak. I did like the chapter on gravitational force(13).There are too many textbooks out there that assume that the reader already knows the subject, as hard as it is too believe, math books are notorious for it. This book is yet another one."
1,Absolutely TERRIBLE.,"This textbook is HORRIBLE. I don't think I've ever come across a textbook with so little information in it. The examples are terrible and don't help you at all with the practice problems. Most sections are just an explanation of how each equation is derived; there are no clear explanations behind the actual topics. Rarely they include actual information in the chapters, although it is usually way too vague and can't really be applied to any of the problems. None of it speaks to specific problems or situations, they clearly assume that the reader knows physics already. Unless you're already proficiant in both physics and AT LEAST calc 2, this book will be a complete waste of money and no help at all. All in all, if you want a textbook that you can actually learn things from, this isn't the book for you."
1,Disgusting ripoff,"Do you guys know that this book sells in Europe for about 70 bucks? That's HALF its price in the US and about the right price it should have. Then why does it sell for twice as much in the US? Because of the ""cooperation"" between publishing companies and colleg professors who force thier college students to spend unbelievable sums to get textbooks. I understand (but don't justify) the greedy publishing companies behavious, but why do college professors allow these crooks to go on with this business?"
3,Not the best quality,"If you are buying this book for use in high school, you should find a different book. This book requires the use of calculus and problems in here shouldn't even be attempted without learning it. It comes with many problems at the end of each chapter. With the instructor's manual that is about 70~90 questions in every chapter. However, the explanation and examples don't provide enough information to solve all the problems in the book. Great as a supplement but cannot replace lectures."
3,Good for number crunching not for thinking,"There is a problem with modern science texts, including this one. They are more concerned with number crunching and finding the answer, then actually testing your knowledge. Yes, at some points there are some really interesting problems. However, most of the ""challenging"" problems include rehash of material from previous chapters coupled with the current chapter. There should be an emphasis on weird problems with different things happening, so you actually refer to the masses, charges, and currents as if they were your friend and start talking physis out loud (i.e. ""what will this charge do?""). A greater emphasis should be placed on the fundamental equations and applying them to get much more specific equations for certain scenarios."
1,Irritating,"I am not an idiot. Far from it. However, I can't understand the glowing praise I see this book receiving. As I am currently working through this text, I may be a bit closer to home than those who have completed the task.I am seriously less than fond of this book. There doesn't seem to be enough background in the material to handle the problems. This is most noticeable in the middle chapters. There are problems which are flat out insoluble if you utilize only the material in the book. There are problems are so far beyond the examples given in the body of the chapter as to leave you swimming for a method to solve them.I am presently searching for secondary companion books that will present the material in such a fashion that I don't have to count on blind luck intuitive leaps of logic to solve the problems, but rather on solid problem solving methodology."
1,Get another book.,This is not a very good book. There are college level books that explain physics more clearly and at a faster pace. This book is not clear. Even if we had the teachers edition it wouldn't be very good. A lot of kids that have been in honors physics have trouble with this book. Get another one even if you have to use this book.
4,As a self-learning text...,"I wanted to be a Physicist, but life had a different direction for me. Now, at age 50, I am trying to realize that dream, at least on a hobbyist's level. It would be difficult to cold-start with this text; you really should know high school physics and introductory calculus. I accomplished this with... believe it or not, Physics for Dummies and Calculus for Dummies. With this, and some on-line tutorials, I have been watching the MIT physics lectures, and working from this text. I work on every single problem, and am hitting over 90% correct. It takes a lot of time and paper, but I have plenty of both. I have not gone through many other texts, so for what it is worth... It works for me!"
5,Brighten Your Table,"My friend Barbara gives wonderful dinner parties and her tables always look so beautiful that it's a joy to sit down to the delicious dinners that she and her husband prepare. She is always looking for new party ideas and I'm always trying to think of gift ideas for her because she seems to have everything. This book on napkin folding was the perfect answer. It's something she has never thought of but I know she'll have great fun with it, once she sees these lovely color pictures and follows the clear instructions. Her birthday is coming up soon and I can't wait to give her this book. As a matter of fact I would like a copy for myself and a few more for gifts to other people. Not a run-of-the-mill present and one that has lots of value for the price."
3,"Attractive, But Needs A Little Work","I ordered this for my wife for her birthday as she loves heart jewelry. I thought it would be a double win since she also tends to have trouble fastening bracelets by herself (as we all do). However, when she but the bracelet on and began moving around, the toggle slipped out of the heart. Thinking it was a fluke, she put it back on and the same thing happened within a few seconds. The heart is a little too big and the toggle easily slips out with very little movement. We have another gold heart of a similar size that my wife plans on taking to a jeweler and have soldered onto the bracelet's gold heart in such a way that will make the opening smaller and keep the toggle in place."
1,too easy to lose,"very lovely, but toggle is too small to hold in the heart & bracelet falls off. Not a good thing."
4,made me the fag hag I am today,"I read this in high school. This was one of the first peices of gay ""literature"" I ever read and I fell totally in love with it (and what I imagined gay culture to be). Elitist, warm, fun and fantastical. I'm re-reading it now and I'm on Amazon looking for more work by the author. I hope I find something just as good."
3,Gay Microcosm,"I loved 'How Long Has This Been Going On' I thought it was a fantastic collection of characters and an accurate and revealing look at the gay lifestyle. The same can be said for this I guess, but in the much more specific microcosm of mainly fire island.Threaded together by a narrator named Bud, the book becomes collected stories from his friends and their varied experiences in and out of love. I couldn't help but wish by the end that the book was a simple straight narrative as opposed to short stories. The problem was that while some were very entertaining, others I found boring, and 22 years after it's been published the ideas no longer resonate as fresh. I think for me, the book is best approached as a time piece of a culture that morphs as quickly as the lights on the dance floor."
3,honest evaluation,"After reading this book, I find too many illustrations and not enough explanations of the various procedures."
4,CORPORATE CHESS!,"What goes on inside the corporate boardroom? Who decides how business is really done or undone?Authors Vlasic and Stertz offer a juicy, spell-binding no holds barred look at the recent machinations of the Daimler-Benz/Chrysler merger. Missing only is an account of the impact of this hi-jinks corporate chess game on those employees who were down-sized or dismissed. What about them? Although the book focuses on mammoth Chrysler, it brings to mind another colossal entity slowly dismantled . It finally ceased to exist. Remember Pan American World Airways, Inc ? Wasn't Kirk Kerkorian around for that one too?If you are intrigued by mergers, re-structuring corporations, how to build a new empire over the bones of the old entity- then you may enjoy this book."
5,very good,Very good reading. Well written. Easy to read. Pictures would be nice but not needed. Covered all the basis to include cultural tid bits as well as financial matters. Good flow.
5,Taken For A Ride,"Riveting detail and hidden agendas give you an arresting look behind the scenes at how massive global mergers can hinge on the smallest of issues. Anybody who cares about the global economy, is fascinated by characters like Lee Iacocca or loves cars should absolutely buy this book. Readers who just like a moving yarn full of surprises will delight in this fast paced narrative."
4,Just think...,"As 2001 approaches, it's terrific to read the thoughts and ideas of what motivated the leaders of Chrysler, especially Bob Eaton, to merge forces with Daimler.Just because the book is complete, the learning and story developments don't stop. Business Week, WSJ, Forbes, all talk about how all American Chrysler leaders have been replaced by the Germans. Seems the ChryCo is continously trying to struggle with these changes of combining ""equal"" forces. Who's to know what is right around the corner...but this book certainly delivers a sure-footed foundation for understanding WHY these companies merged.""A good read""...writes adlerkevin@yahoo.com.Drop me a line with your feedback!"
1,Wrong part,I ordered the Intermatic FD12HWC - 12 hour timer and received a 15 minute timer.Installed it and now realize it's the wrong one. All packaging is in the can.Trying to figure out how to return and get the right one.
2,Cluttered and Too much unwanted material,"Explanation is too cluttered and a lot of material is off topic(threads, sockets,..). On the other hand topics like the newer 1.2 Activation is not covered in detail. I felt ""Java.rmi"" book by Esmond Pitt to be a more useful resource."
5,Arrived on time and the book is like new. Perfect,I ordered it from Australia. And it arrived on time and the book looks like new.
2,too much unnecessary material,"This book can actually be covered in 1/5 of the pages. It is ironic that the author stated that the reader should have a certain amount of java experience, and yet he went on to cover many general java topics (e.g. serialization, threading, sockets, security etc) in great length."
3,A great debut,"The focus of Neill and his family is his younger brother's battle with cancer, so his own inner conflict about his sexual orientation is set aside. Accompanying his brother to the clinic, Neill meets another patient named Vince who draws Neill into a complicated and unsettling romance that he hides from his family. Neill falls deeper into Vince's dark and self-destructive life where he learns about courage, love, and truth, and ultimately finds the strength to tell his own truths to his family. Healey's poetic storytelling beautifully illuminates the romance, but stumbles elsewhere in the novel, creating an uneven path through the story. Overall this is a notable fiction debut from a writer whose burgeoning potential is only glimpsed here."
3,Colefax & Fowlers Interior Inspirations,This is more the interior inspirations of Roger Banks-Pye. There are some very good pictures with descriptions. The book doesn't stand out from other books on interior decoration but there are lots of good photographs and ideas. If you like the English eclectic style then this is a very good book.
2,only for die-hard fans of traditional and country,"I like to think of myself as having an eclectic style; I have many influences. I like some country and traditional elements. I had heard favorable things about Colefax and Fowler, so I thought this book would be a good representation of English country style. If this is the best, I would hate to see the worst. I don't think readers that want to explore English country should start with this book. It might turn them off. However, long-time fans of tradional and country styles might derive more benefit."
2,Hitler (sort of...),"The best thing about this series is having the majority of all the best Hitler film footage in one collection. But its not exactly a completely neutral re-telling of the story, so beware. Using a combination of many interviews with elderly Germans who say - in effect with 20/20 hindsight - ""we knew he was evil, we just couldn't put our finger on it at the time"" - and the technique of slowing Hitler's own recordings down to half speed to make him sound like Satan himself. This is really a piece of propaganda no less than anything Goebbels ever produced."
4,Interesting approach,"Instead of the usual birth-to-death narrative of most historical biographies, this documentary examines six different aspects of Hitler's personality(The Private Man, The Commander, The Criminal, etc.)and manages to flesh Hitler out a lot more than most Hitler documentaries I've seen. And there is a great deal of previously-unknown information here. I had no idea that Hitler supported the leftist soviet government of Munich after the war and even stood for election to one of its councils.That being said, this series has a drawback or two. Its approach means that it's going to be a bit repetitive. And I feel that the filmmakers place too much of the blame for the horrors of Nazi Germany on Hitler himself and nowhere near enough on the German people who supported him almost to the end. Those reservations aside, however, this is as informative an examination of Hitler as I have ever seen."
2,A rip-off of a documentary,"This highly touted video disappointed me. Their commentary on Hitler's art work was simpleminded, silly. Of course, being a loser, Hitler's art work had to be trashed! Had he been encouraged into going into art as a career I am sure all of us would have applauded especially after seeing what the monster did to the world as leader of Germany. Also the quality of the video images is poor. The Germans were master photographers in black and white photography."
4,A Pretty Picture Book,"If you're looking for great decorating ideas, this is a pretty nice book, BUT, it also has pictures of flowers and food, so it's not wall-to-wall decorating. There are no earth-shattering decor revelations here, but if you collect books to flip though to get ideas, or just love looking at pretty things, this one's not too shabby."
1,Just an uninspiring picture book and nothing more useful,"If you're looking for lasting decorating ideas, look elsewhere. If you want to wanly leaf through a coffee table picture book and read brief captions, borrow this from the library. The book is not formatted to inspire, it was created to showcase Andrew Wood's photography, and a name was added to the book: Stephanie Hoppen, whomever she may be. Isolating chapters include Easter Celebrations, Spring Flowers, a chapter on White Foods (!!!)... Shame on all involved in this unethical money-making venture."
2,a book for name droppers,"I love white decorating from rustic to elegant. But this book left me deflated. It seemed more like a way to show off who she knows and where she buys. I dont care who owns the shop, I'm more about creating a beautiful comfortable home than being able to brag about where something was purchased and from whom. The pictures are average, the name dropping is annoying. I wanted to love it......but I didn't."
2,snd571,"This watch looks good in the picture,but it looks cheap on your wrist.It also scatches very easily.I've been very careful,but the strap is showing wear after two weeks."
3,QC needs improved,"Returned first set as the Band was improperly drilled/threaded. Second set much better but still a non-trivial exercise to get the band to adequately tighten. If I had a good alternative, I would go there."
1,Uncle Mikes 1593 2 Shotgun Sling Swivel,I never got the assembly mounted. The allen head screw indent immediately rounded out so that I could not tighten front swivel to Winchester model 12 magazine tube. What a disappointment and waste of money.
2,not thrilled,"I installed this on my shotgun, the barrel mount fit barley tight even though it was the right size for my gun. It came loose and scratched the barrel up! not thrilled with this set up at all."
4,Not just for shotguns,"For those who may not have considered this, Mike's barrel swivel kit will also work on T/C handgun bull barrels. I have added these to all of my Contender barrels along with a short shoulder sling. Works great. My only complaint is that the allen head screw that comes with the kit could be of a higher grade steel as it is too easily rounded off and then becomes useless."
5,Destroyer Droid,"This Droideka figure is really awesome! Though I was a little disappointed that it can't roll up into a ball, it really is a great toy. It's not supposed to sit with the legs bent to look like feet, as shown in the picture. It should(and does) stay up with them more straight, with the three tips of the legs being the ""feet"". It comes with a Commtech chip, but I don't really know what a Destroyer Droid would actually say (I don't think that they speak in the movies). Now if I only had a Commtech chip reader..."
1,Wrongly Marketed to Children,"My rating of one star isn't based on the quality of the movie, but on the fact that it is marketed to young children. I watch horror films for research and even now none of them have the power to upset me like this movie does. This is one of the most dark, depressing movies I've ever seen, and while I suppose it shows the negative consequences of seeking vengence, several scenes could also be interpreted as being literally Nietzschean in their depiction of the strong preying on the weak, and may send a fatalist message that some people are destined to be victims no matter what path they choose. This is definitely NOT a message we want to send via children's cinema. This is an adult film and due to its dark themes and conclusion, I think it should have an R rating. We all know that life is filled with harsh realities, but there are plenty of high quality films out there that teach life lessons via more age-appropriate storylines."
5,Great Movie!!,"I watched this as a child and always remembered it, once I found it again and watched it, the messege shown through the movie really hits home. Life isn't always easy and one's life can alter over night. And if you allow hate and revenge to consume you, you'll find yourself alone and wishing you weren't. Some people may think its to ""harsh"" for children, I disagree. In today's world children need to be aware that there are many different paths to chose from in life, and not all of them lead to happly ever after-with any action taken there is always a reaction in response. Yes, the movie is sad but comes with a powerful messege."
3,Haunting,"I saw this movie when I was about 5 years old, I always remembered it as being very sad. Although I did like it when I was young, and I recently watched it again and still thought it was a beautiful and haunting tale of revenge, losing yourself, and paying for your choices in life. This is a sad movie, I can understand why some might think it isnt suitable for young children. There is some violence in it, and it doesnt have the usually happy ending like most children's movies do, but it is a great story."
5,This book saved my life!,"I was being driven nuts by all my kids' different demands for meals! This book helped me figure out how to deal with all of their differences, and to stop fighting about it with my husband! Excellent guide !"
5,A Wonderful CD!,"A wonderful, beautiful CD. The fact that the music is all inter-related creates a beautiful atmosphere while listening. I know enough to know that this type of artistic endeavor is a collaboration; so kudos to David Russell, producer Rosalind Ilett and engineer Thomas Knab! I understand that this team has worked on many of David Russell's amazing recordings."
2,Rah's reveiw,"I found the noval very relaxing as i drifted in to dream land at about 1 in the morning, having only red the first page."
5,A Gradual Awakening,I saw this book at a friends house and started reading it. I knew it would help me with my meditation. When I got home I ordered it and have been most happy with my purchase.
3,For the not yet even moderately mindful,"I thought I would slip a review in here by someone who is already familiar with mindfulness. The thing with many books on mindfulness, is that they don't offer anything except encouragement to be mindfull. I would suggest this book for occassional reading for those who often forget their consciousness for days at a time. Slow and continuous reading will help implement the motivation to be more aware."
5,It Just Keeps Graduating...,"In 1989, I was in drug-rehab where I was given this book by one of the psychologists. It literally changed my whole point of view on many issues and introduced me to Spriituallity and Meditation. I still practice Vipasanna and Chakara Meditation to this day. The book itself is written very simply with passion and will appeal to all levels of intellect. I have since then bought every book that Stephen Levine has published and I recommend all of them highly!"
5,thin and very durable,I wear these daily and they lastthey are thin and durablea must have for a runner or just a casual wearer.
1,Not as listed on website.,"I wanted the socks with the gray stripe because they have more cushioning for tennis. The photos on the website listed the socks with the gray strip as ""Ultra Light."" It did not sound right to me but I ordered from the picture. I received socks with the blue strip which are labeled as Ultra Light. I kept the socks because they are good for short walking distances, but they are not supportive enough for tennis.I went back to the Amazon website and this time ordered the socks listed as ""Light."" This are pictured with a blue strip but I ordered based on the listing. I received another set of socks with the blue strip labeled as Ultra Light. I am returning these.If at all possible, please make sure the photos match the product listing. I ordered the socks with the gray strip directly from Feetures. Thanks."
5,A refreshing piece of work,"You can not read this book through to the end and not see the truth that the Auther is trying to convey. With all his points backed up by scripture, and his credible education, the reader can rely on this book as a source of truth. I particularly enjoyed the part on Passover and the time table of Jesus death and reserection. Growing up in a home where we understood that Easter had peagan roots starting with the very name, I always thought that it didn't make sence that Christians did not celebrate Passover. In this book, I saw how the Catholic Easter is off on it's time table of Jesus last days and how passover has more to do with the death and reserection then the holiday Easter could ever have. I feel that Christians have been cheated out of their Heritage in the Jewish roots. Every Christian should read this book, and books like it that depict true Christian history, and what God's plan is for his people."
1,Jewish Kabbalism,"This book is not based on Scripture, but on the Talmudic teachings of Jewish rabbis who rejected Jesus Christ as the Messiah. According to Peter Michas, mankind will recognize the coming Messiah on the basis of theories derived from the legends of these unbelieving rabbis and the Hebrew Roots misinterpretation of Scripture. Bottom line is the false teachings in this book are setting readers up to receive a false messiah, the Antichrist, during the Tribulation period. There is a review of this book on the Watch Unto Prayer website which details its teachings and shows that they are identical to those found in the Talmud, Kabblalah and other occult sources.Google:""WATCH UNTO PRAYER REVIEW OF THE ROD OF AN ALMOND TREE"""
2,Useful material interspersed with contrived machinations...,"On the surface, this work appears to be very scholarly and thought-provoking. However, Mr. Michas demonstrates an inadequate grasp of the Greek language at times. He utilizes seemingly logical arguments with a subtle twisting of Scriptures to cater to his own personal conclusions. Some conclusions have no basis in Scripture whatsoever! That being said, there are some pearls to be harvested as well. A word to the wise: study this book with a grain of salt!"
5,"Love, Love, Loved - Love Lessons!","This book was excellent! Lois Smith Brady is really a treat to read. I would highly recommend the book as a gift for newly engaged couples or for married couples. Inspiring stories for singles - many hopeful stories about finding love in the most unusual places. All of the stories are funny, insightful and touching in some way!"
5,A must read,"Like real life Harrys meeting Sallys! These short stories are so remarkably moving, so magical and inspiring and funny its difficult to believe they could be true. But Brady is such a beautiful writer, that each story came to life in my heart. I couldn't put this down."

5,Superb series,"This is one of the best series ever. Basically a police procedural, the series is superbly plotted, written, acted, and directed. The regular actors project their characters beautifully, and the viewer really comes to care about them. The plots are riveting, with superb guest stars more than holding their own.The series takes place in Cornwall, with beautiful scenery, but the situations are not romanticised, and the tough economics of the region come through.I cannot recommend this series strongly enough."
1,Love the show but no subtitles,I don't understand why most of the programs from the UK come without English subtitles. I cannot buy them without the subtitles which I regret because I like the English mysteries much more than any from the US
2,Tight in calf!,"The shaft of the boot is really snug around the calf. I am a woman with really small calves, only 14"" around, so I never expected this problem. I ordered men's 6/women's 7 size. The size fits my foot perfectly, but the calf is SNUG. I would never be able to tuck even light pants into them in the outdoor wetlands and my pants will get muddy and soaked. What's the deal MuckBoots?! Lovely boot otherwise. Could use more flexibility in the front of boot when walking, it knocked into my front shin with every step."
3,Just wont fit,"I really wanted to make a pair of these boots work as they seem well made and highly functional with almost a cult following among fellow outdoor enthusiasts. But, I could not make these fit. I have long low volume feet. I'm generally 11.5 to 12 in most of my hiking boots, but the 11s were to small and the 12s big and sloppy. What's strange is that I tried on the more expensive ""Woody Sport"" in a store and the 11s fit perfectly. I don't know if different models are built on different lasts or if the sizing is a quality control issue, but I just couldn't make them work for me. Three stars because they don't carry half sizes."
3,Muckboots Wetlands,Half size would be much better fit. Boots are heavier than Lacrosse Alpha Burly. The calfs are tight and I do not have big calfs. Also they are a little for hot for Eastern North Carolina.
3,Ok,"Not that impressed, I like the boots however they are really hot and the side above the rubber on the leg tore after wearing them for a week..."
3,sturdy but too heavy for me,I bought these because I wanted a better tread on my boot. The other muck boots I have are too slippery in the mud.These boots are really well made with a good sole but very stiff and not cushy like my other pair. They are also fairly heavy. I need a boot that isn't this heavy but has a good tread....any suggestions?
5,Awesome boots,"This is a great pair of boots, very comfortable, accurate sizing and very warm, no complains here. You can't go wrong."
1,Where's the whole song?,Waited almost 5 months to get this single and the live version cuts off before the addded ending starts to play. I've tried to find where there is a video on here and none of my playing devices pick it up. In fact the cd itself doesn't even say there is a video on it. Still a big fan but not really worth the money if you have all his other cds and the concert dvd.
1,Copy protected CD,Don't buy this CD if you want to listen to it on your portable MP3 player - it has copy protection that prohibits copying to digital format!
5,Teachers Go Through This--Well Done,"As a story, the film is flawed. As a slice of life, it is relentlessly honest and real. I give it 5 stars because it made me remember my years of working as a teacher in Chicago, knowing that something had to be done, but you just couldn't do it. At best, you could help some, but never enough. God, this film hit home. I commend the filmmaker for trying to see all sides of the equation--students, teachers and those who walk beside them in the journey. Perhaps those of us who go into the helping professions do so because we need so much help ourselves. We heal the wound by reopening it daily as some sort of penance. Henry seems to be that sort of hurting healer that takes the burden on himself while he casts it away similtaneously. The section on doublethink may apply to him more than any other character, but the system itself and the society that spawns the dysfunction is equally a player in the 1984 scenario of believing the lie while knowing what it is."
5,Thought Provoking Drama w/ Amazing Cast,"This movie really exceeded my expectations with great performances across the board. The depth of Brody's character, coupled with a brutally honest script that is beautifully executed by the director, Tony Kaye, makes for a constantly engaging movie. James Caan provides for some vital comic relief to a film that deals with tough subject matter. For me, the film exhibits how important it is to cultivate and maintain relationships. If you like to be engaged in thought throughout a movie, you will find this highly entertaining."
4,Great movie!,This movie gives an appreciation for the challenges of inner-city school teachers. The acting was also great. I would recommend this movie.
3,Expected more,"This movie, again with a fine actor, hits a few nails on the head, but I just couldn't relate to the characters in it. It just ""didn't quite get there"" as a revealing ""teacher deals with education"" movie."
1,Depressing !,"I myself am a high school English teacher and after watching this it struck me as extremely dark, pessimistic, and an overly emotional look at what life is like for kids these days. Watching this film makes one think that all kids are rude, disrespectful and one nasty comment away from killing themselves. I beg to differ; it seems to me the real problem that film makers need to be addressing is teenagers addiction to technology and how that is affecting their ability to successfully interact with others. Also, this film makes it look like all teachers have terrible lives outside of school and that their jobs are simply an extension of this awful they live. Not true. Good teachers love their work and are constantly looking for ways to improve their craft. Go ahead and skip this one, unless you're into majorly depressing movies with no redeeming message."
4,A tough film worth watching.,"Rented this from Amazon Instant video the day of limited theatre release, 16 March 2012; well worth the price because it's not a film you really need to see on the big screen and have to pay the movie-house prices for.A tough film worth watching."
5,You will feel this movie long after it leaves your player!!!,"Here's The Lowedown on ""Detachment"" (A Drama DVD review)...LOVED IT!!Genre: 9 Movie: 8What's it about?Detachment is a chronicle of three weeks in the lives of several high school teachers, administrators and students through the eyes of a substitute teacher named Henry Barthes.What did I think?I have watched a lot of movies from the students point of view about how bad teachers are. Seeing this story from the teacher's point of view sent a powerful message that should be heard by everyone. I still cannot get this movie out of my head and it has been days. It can tug on your heart strings and make you want to throw something at the TV at the same time. Don't take this decision lightly, but decide to watch this film."
4,Just the right dose of raw,"I had never heard of this film before, and being a fan of Adrian Brody over the years i had seen this on Netflix and decided late one night to check it out. By the first half hour i knew this was going to be a gem that i would recommend. It has a very strong cast, and is very raw. Personally i love movies that pull at your heart strings and give you a reality check. I have now shown and told two friends about this film and they has said nothing but positive things about it as well."
5,I can't believe no one has heard of Laurence in the States.,"This is one of my favorite books, and I just finished reading it. It's all about the characterization of Morag Gunn, a somewhat eccentric, but undeniably strong woman. Laurence evokes emotions like desperation and loneliness and confusion and even, yes, sexual desire, without resorting to either sentimental cliche or philosophical essays. Highly, highly recommended."
5,The Great Canadian Novel,"This book captures it all: the tension between French Canada and English Canada, between the town and the city, between aboriginal and immigrant; Lawrence's work captures the ambiguousness that is Canada. This is also very much a book about women, and women's stuggles in Canada in the twentieth century. Very rich, full of detail, with vibrant characters, Lawrence's masterpiece is a pleasure to read again and again. It was (in my opinion) wrongfully banded from classrooms in Canada when it was published, and, unfortunately, remains largely unread by Canadian students. Note: telefilm Canada has produced a wonderful film version of this novel."
2,Very disappointing,"I didn't like this book much. I found it confusing and boring, with little character development, and sort of a meandering story line that gets lost in a few places along the way.I found that the story meandered and stagnated a bit, and didn't get caught up in any of the characters. I was not the least bit interested in what happens to Morag, and I must have tried five times to finish the book before finally getting through it.As a Canadian, I've been told all my life that Margaret Laurence is one of our greatest treasures, and a quintessential Canadian author. Funny thing is, I *didn't* read this because I had to for school - I bought it at a yard sale. I personally feel I should have saved my quarter for something better."
4,Living with your mother,"if you grew up with your mother and a distant father, then this book is an absolute must."
2,It's a waste of paper... save some trees and don't buy it...,"Well, another novel written by Laurence about some old woman going on about how tough her life was, and how terrible things always were for her... I don't think that Laurence was really all that great of an author if this is ""One of her best"". The book was dry, and very boring... not at all interesting... The reccurent use of the whiny old lady plot line is really getting to me... A note to all English Teachers out there, we don't enjoy this kind of stuff --- So please stop making us read it! (I've had to read 3 of her books this year)"
3,War and Peace,"I bought this DVD for my husband who watched it years ago.He is an avid Napoleonic History lover and really liked the movie, the longer battle scenes.I watched it too, but thought it slow for someone not interested in this topic. The american version was enough for me.I still enjoyed it though."
4,War & Peace 1967 from Amazon,"Upon receiving the sealed 3 DVD set, I discovered Disc 1 was severely flawed. Skipping forward a chapter or several, disc quality remained unusable. Disc 2 is fabulous."
4,war and peace,"Not many people can deny any great film like this epic film. But whoever want to order those great SPECIAL classic movies. They'd love to have the original screen aspect ratio, high quality sound and picture. They link to their past."
2,Really dated production,"I wish I had not purchased this film.I find it difficult to watch because the languages are treated inconsistently. For example, there is considerable dialog in French but it's not translated in any way.What the makers did to Russian is worse. Sometimes it's dubbed-in, in English, but sometimes even in the same scene the origial audio replaces the English while subtitles appear. This has the effect of dramatically illustrating the difference in voice between the dubber and the original actor!The end result is too much overlapping of audio tracks and subtitles. In my opinion it would have been far better to leave the original Russian audio intact and simply use sub-titles throughout. What we have here is confusing and difficult to follow.Then there is the issue of mid 1960's dramatic over-acting. This I think was the final straw for me.I'll just have to read the book."
1,Ruscico War & Peace DVD is horribly defective,"ZERO STARS. What a dissappointment! The film randomly switches between English and Russian and French dubbing ---sometimes in the same section--- and the subtitles don't always come on in English. I tried it on 2 DVD players so it is quite defective. Judging from some other reviews, other people are experiencing it but for some strange reason they find this acceptable. This is the first DVD I have ever seen which was this screwed up. Too bad----a great movie which I still have only on Beta (Kultur version)."
2,Bugger,"Oh my, it's really *not* good like the novel is good or, say, Lean's ""Oliver"" is good. Hire first. HIRE FIRST!"
5,"The best screen adaptation of ""War and Peace"" ever made","Actually, this movie is a genial picturization of the genial novel.A constellation of characters created by the constellation of character actors and actresses: Sergei Bondarchuk himself as Pierre Bezukhov, Lyudmila Savelieva as Natasha Rostova, Vyacheslav Tikhonov as Andrei Bolkonsky... Misterious Russian soul. You should not miss this movie! I highly recommend other movies by Bondarchuk: ""The Man's Destiny"", ""Father Sergyi"", ""They Battled for the Motherland""."
5,recklessness or honor?,"Film depicts ""war"" as in the War of 1812, and ""peace"" as in ""mir"", which in Russian more properly means ""society"", or ""out-there"". In fact, the film very interestingly shows delicate, and sometimes brutal interconnections betwenn the Russian soul and her Western dress. Result is unquestionably ornate, even when black and white.This movie can definitely be consireded a masterpiece of a Soviet cinema, although many might find it too long to be exciting. However, I think that it should specifically be interesting to a Russian viewer - not only as a source of knowledge of Tolstoy's fat volume, but also to get a closer frame on Russian nature and poetry of the time."
5,"War and Piece, russian film","It was interesting to read the book first, and then see this movie. Naturally the book was more engrossing, but this version of the story on film is the best of all the different versions that were produced over the years. Six hours lost in Russia in the 19th century. Marvelous."
5,masterpiece... twice,A cinematographic masterpice out of a literary masterpiece. Years have passed after the series was aired on TV and know we can have the complete film for ourselves. Huuuuurrayyy.
3,a noble failure -- just like the ussr,"everyone should sit thru this 7-hours-long epic at least once in his life, tho i doubt anyone would ever want to watch it again. you know how often fans of a novel gripe about how a movie leaves out too much of the book? well, here is an example of what happens when filmmakers INCLUDE too much (tho, truth be told, they still only managed to get in about 85 % of tolstoy's loooooong novel). made with the cooperation of the soviet army (who had nothing else to do in the years between invading hungary and czechoslovakia), one cannot deny the sheer spectacle works; in the era before CGI, one IS simply blown away by the shots of thousands strewn across huge battlefields, and the like. still, the movie while well acted never takes off; it is always flat and workmanlike and massive: arguably the best metaphor one could find for the 1960s-era soviet union."
4,Marred only by English dubbing errors,"Up until the complete LOTR by Jackson was done this was my favorite movie of all times. I have seen it probably 10 times and even called in sick in my youth to see it in one sitting at the movie theater. I used to have the Kultur version on Beta and this is just as good with one exception. You will need to keep the English subtitles on since dubbing track switches at times from English, to French to Russian. I returned it to get a replacement and found the same error. Nevertheless it is faithful to the book with huge diversions as we go from war to the intricate details of the private lives of the characters and yes the philosophical thoughts of the actors are shown beautifully with sweeping shots of the sky and aerial views of land. This is so monumental of a film that it is impossible to criticize anything....and the musical score is gorgeous. If you can add this to your library grab this classic."
3,Lavish but disappointing,I was so impressed with the lavish and authentic costumes and scenes. The battle scenes were very impressive. The acting was good but I'm sorry...the terrible dubbing just ruined this movie for me. Why someone didn't get a good company together to dub is hard to fathom. What a wonderful movie/VCR they would have had.Savelyeva is such a haunting Natasha.Pierre(Bondarchuk) wonderfully acted even through the-terrible dubbing.This is a good renter but I would not spend the money to buy it.
2,5-Star Film But a 2-Star DVD,"The Kultur DVD version of Bondarchuk's ""War and Peace"" -- 3 discs -- is taken from an old scratchy, cloudy film print. I was extremely disappointed to see this magnificent film in such poor condition. MUCH better is the Ruscico / Image version (5 discs).!"
3,Disappointed,"My son has a R2D2 that talks and he loves it, so I ordered this one for his friend thinking it was the same. Unfortunately you need something to go with it to make it talk, which I could not find on the internet. So I was not happy about that."
2,Not really necessary,"You will find that fewer wires are required if you just wire the Buttkickers as per the diagrams on the Buttkicker website and not have to spend over $100 for this unit. This unit might make sense if it were able to select which Buttkickers are on or off which it can't, only the total number of units can be selected. Save your money."
3,So not scarey.,"In the Disney princess collection ""Wish Opon a Starfish,this is a loveing tale of friendship. My daughter always wants to watch these when she is sad or scared. So, I am telling everyone that the Disney princess collection is not scarey!!!!"
5,LOVE this VHS!,I first saw this when I was a 5 year old girl in the 90's and bought it with my money my grandparents sent me in the mail for my birthday. I LOVE this vhs. The message and song Ariel sings with the sign language girl is BEAUTIFUL. I now watch this with my niece and she loves it just as much as I do.
2,best for PS1 & PS2 not PS3,"bought this model because they had the color I wanted. However, when I put it on my PS3 controller there was extra material around the L2/R2 buttons. This product appears to be molded around a PS2 controller since it does not have the same style L2/R2 buttons as the PS3 controller. I ended up having to trim it down around these buttons. I subsequently tore the material and now it appears it won't last very long. I'll have to buy a different model skin soon."
5,No more sweat!,I always had a problem with sweat on my controller and it was very uncomfortable and made it VERY slippery and difficult to play. After purchasing this product that problem has not occurred since. I also like the ribbed design on the side of the controller. But why pay for these when you can get this and other gaming things for FREE. http://www.gamingforfree.tk
5,Super fun to do over and over again,"I am in the process of losing over 100 pounds. 40 pounds into my journey, my wife bought this DVD. It is challenging, but it is fun and rewarding. It took me a couple of times to get the moves down, but like with anything, you can catch on the more you do it. The secret is control and form while doing the moves. That's where the workout comes in. Billy is easy to follow, and somehow, he is very encouraging and motivating. I thoroughly enjoy it and look forward to using it on a regular basis."
3,Decent,Not my favorite but good to cycle through this cardio workout every once in awhile- Like Insanity better- better workout
4,More toning than 'cardio',"I loved this video; it is a great workout and you will definitely be sweating. However, I felt this video was more for toning than cardio."
1,For beginners,"I LOVE Billy Blanks. For years, my workout routine consisted of walking and Tae Bo and was in phenomenal shape. I veered away from him and did traditional-style gym workouts for the past 9 yrs. I decided to give Tae Bo a go again and bought this DVD. NOT for people with any level of endurance. I barely got a sweat and the short bursts with long breaks was counterproductive for a solid workout. Basically, if you're able to run more than half a mile comfortably, I would say this video is not for you. If you are recovering from an injury, have activity restrictions or are severely overweight, this would be a great addition to your DVD library."
1,steam sucks,"I bouht this game after my freind told me about it. after installing the game it told me I needed a steam acount, in all I probably spent a little over 24 hours trying to get it to work, after all the lost time I put into it, it still didnt work. It also messed up my internet conection. later I bouht another computer game made by valve that didnt involve steam and it still didnt work. So I dont know hwo to blame valve or steam."
2,Great game - if you have internet access,"I'll make this review short and to the point. The game itself was great with wonderful graphics and easy maneuverability via the mouse and keyboard.Getting the game to load was a different problem. I bought this game to give to my brother-in-law, who is in Iraq. Little did I realize you need to have an internet connection in order to play it.I first tested the game on my PC. After I installed the game and tried to run it, I received the following message: ""Steam.exe(Main Exception): Unable to load library steam.dll"". A little research revealed that the ""steam.exe"" that came with the disk was bad and I needed to download a newer version of steam.After about 3 hours of work, I was able to play the game in off-line mode. You shouldn't have to be connected to the internet to play any game purchased at a store. It's for this reason I cannot recommend this game - especially to those whose computer isn't connected to the internet."
5,great game,"I thought counter strike was a great game.Although it is a little hard to play at first but once you know what to do,counter strike became more fun."
5,THE ORIGINAL IS STILL THE BEST,ONE OF THE BEST 1ST PERSON SHOOTERS OUT THERE. I GOT A GREAT DEAL ON IT TOO ($10)! DON'T PASS UP ON THIS ONE. TONS OF FUN AND YOU CAN PLAY MULTILAYER WITH BOTS! BUY THIS GAME!
3,Juego increible pero en STEAM es mas economico.,Juego increible Counter Strike ya va como 15 años en nuestras vidas y sigue siendo pasión de muchos gamers como yo. Sin embargo es mucho mejor comprarlo en Steam porque cuesta como un tercio.
2,Issues,The Steam engine will not allow you to register a previously used game. The seller and I didn't know this. The seller refunded my money without hassle.
5,bpsusan,I really love this pan. it is great to cook oatmeal in the morning for breakfast.It takes a little longer but is worth it. Easy to clean
5,Great!,This was my first Le Creuset purchase and I doubt it will be my last! I love this little pot - it's perfect for warming up milk for hot cocoa or tomato sauce. It seems to be very well made - nice smooth enamel coating over the cast iron. Very easy to clean and I like how it keeps a simmer even on an electric stovetop. Hope this helps anyone thinking about buying this pot! :-)
3,They work,"Cheap. They work. You get what you pay for. Fit & finish very poor. As long as they stay air tight & don't fog up, I will be satisfied."
4,Very interesting and enjoyable.,"A wonderful book targeted at magazine editing, but great background reading for web designers. Somewhat dated, but still relevant in many areas."
5,Hot-blooded Stuff,"I agree with the other reviewers. This is every bit as good as its predecessor, The Book of Common Dread. That's rare for a sequel. A truly original take on the vampire tradition. The pace is excellent. Several nice twists don't hurt either. I'd love to see this become a movie."
5,Erotically stimulating!,"This novel was extremely excellent. It is one of the most amazing vampire stories ever written. The dark humor and blazing real-ness make this book a very entertaining piece of art! It stimulates the senses with lust and death and extreme erotic evilness. The story is one of the battle between the dark and the light, the good and evil, and the human race and the vampire race that hopes to take over the world with it's blood hungry kind. I highly recommend this novel to ANY one who enjoys a great horror story!"
3,diverting escapist fare,"This sequel to The Book of Common Dread (1993) finds Monahan's protagonists, Simon Penn and Frederika Vanderveen, once again struggling to protect the scrolls of Ahriman from the vampires and the forces of evil which they serve. This time the intrepid pair get some assistance from a policeman turned Vatican priest and a local police officer. The whole thing builds to another showdown between good and evil within the halls of Princeton's Firestone Library.Monahan has borrowed extensively from the vampiric traditions but has added enough of his own invention, including making them servants of Satan, to produce a new and exciting mythos. There is more lively fun in these books than in the entire gloom drenched, self-serious oeuvre of Anne Rice & her ilk. They make for diverting escapist fare.GRADE: C+"
4,the blood of the covenant,"While this book was interesting and kept me reading, it was not nearly as good as ""The Book of Common Dread."" I loved the characters, so I was kept interested, and we learn some new things about vampires and the scrolls. The main problem was that this book felt like it was building up to something (a third book perhaps) that never happens. Sure, there was a nice battle at the end where good triumphed over evil for the time being, but there is still so much left to tell in this story. I've read on Mr. Monahan's website that he won't be writing a third book anytime soon, but I hate that he left us hanging."
3,Good and Bad,"I am mixed in my opinion of this book, so I'll review it in the middle. There are a few problems I have though. Ms. Cohen focuses too much on Judaism in general, and doesn't talk enough about Kabbalah. I bought the book to learn about Kabbalah. I love the affirmations/meditations and have been using them, but there is no instruction on how or when to use them. Shouldn't that be explained in a beginners book? Also, it is never explained why the book is called ""10 Minute Kabbalah,"" the book is over 200 pages, you can't read it in 10 minutes.After reading the first few pages and seeing Ms. Cohen's situation is just like mine, a 40 something Reformed Jewish female wanting to connect with her religious roots, I thought this is the book for me! But, it really falls short of explaining a lot about Kabbalah. Also, there are wayyyyy too many references to her son!I read a wonderful book ""Simple Kabbalah"" by Kim Zetter. MUCH better than this one and highly recommended!!"
5,I own the whole series of Frank Mantooths books!,I am not crazy about all of the chord suggestions but it is good to have the option. I am crazy about the song choices in Frank Mantooths song books. I've purchased every one of his books because the songs are some of the best ever written and they are published on one or 2 pages and very easy to read.
4,Comments from Down Under,"There are some nice alternate chords here which work well with my own. As I use different chord progressions not all apply, but this is a good buy which I would highly recommend.Peter Foreman""Jazz Renaissance""Taupo, New Zealand"
3,A mixture of technical & understandable information,"This book is a fairly useful resource for those interested in air cooling. Although it put me to sleep, there is some pretty good information. The six chapters were each composed by a different person or group and thus each have different technical content. The first few chapters contain a lot of technical information and require a very strong mathematical background to fully comprehend. These chapters can still yield some basic helpful information with a cursory read. Some of the other chapters leave the equations out of it and convey some beneficial in a 'rule of thumb' sort of way. Overall, I found it dry but beneficial. I believe it would be even more helpful to those involved in circuit board cooling."
5,Great Commentary,"Even though John Stott doesn't consider this book and its companions as commentaries, they do the trick for laypersons. There are great explanations of scripture from a conservative theological point of view meaning the Bible is considered the inerrant word of God. He brings competing interpretations into the mix and then tells you his choice and why. Great for small group Bible study leaders for students studying on their own. Best if used with his Bible Study Guides. You can't go wrong with any of his studies or ""commentaries."""
5,Fantastic commentary,"Stott manages t give a thoughtful, clear analysis of Romans. I am really enjoying this, and would recommend it to anybody that wants to gain a little more understanding of the Word."
5,The Message of Romans,John R. W. Stott is as good as it gets in unpacking the meanings and messages of scripture. Thanks to him.
5,Well written,"Great book, understandable, clear, informative and most helpful with the study of Romans."
5,Excellent read!,"I was required to read this book in a bible class entitled Life & letters of Paul 1 in the Fall 2004 semester with the know late Dr. Barth Campbell of Simpson University. What a excellent source this book was! Stott provides much detail to the book of Romans after being exposed to his scholarship you'll want to avoid study bibles, and whole bible or testament single volume commentaries.For the scholarly minded I'd expect you to understand the problems with study bibles, single volume, and application commentaries. Build your library with commentaries, and always include a Stott work."
4,"very good, but too long","For me, this is probably one of the best written commentaries I have read in a while, however, the length of it isn't necessary, but as far as understanding and depth, and a catalyst to spur on continual thinking, it is good..."
2,Disappointed...,"I brought the SanDisk Memory Stick Pro to be used with a Sony Clie' handheld that I purchased at the same time, only to discover that the memory stick is not compatible wiith the palm computer. Needless to say I'm disappointed, and unfortunately there no way to right the wrong!"
4,Good Value,Memory stick is comparable to the Sony. Price was a factor. would recommend purchase for camera use.
1,Beware Sandisk and Sony,"I should have paid attention to the reviewers who gave this product a low rating. I purchased the SDMSV-1024-A10 for my Sony DSC-P8 digital camera based on Sandisk's compatibility chart on their website. It did not work right from the start. A call to Sandisk tech support reported no known issues. They directed me to call Sony. The tech rep at Sony stated that there were issues with Sandisk and Sony so the only way to find out was to follow the Sony procedure for formatting. The tech stepped me through the procedure with no luck - her response was to send it back and buy a Sony next time. The reseller for Amazon, Antonline, was unwilling to refund the purcahse so I appealed to Amazon which gave me a full refund - a class company. I wonder why they do business with such poor customer-service based companies? SO BEWARE OF USING SONY AND SANDISK TOGETHER!! - It's hit or miss - buyer beware."
1,"Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't","It took several times to get the camera to recognise the stick. Once it took, it worked fine. It worked in the card reader, but then I had trouble getting it to work again in the camera. Bending the stick finally made the contacts make contact, but this isn't something that should be necessary for an electronic product."
4,Shed Your Inhibitions...and STILL Be Decent,"Ron Hoff's ""Do Not Go Naked Into Your Next Presentation"" is pocket-sized inspiration and common sense when it comes to facing an audience and presenting a speech. It's an easy read--not intimidating in the least--and will set the tone. many times through humor to help make a good speech even better. I use it in my public speaking courses at a local university, and the students get alot out of this little book.Hoff's accounts are a ""must have"" if you want to improve public speaking skills. In just a few words, he is able to empower you with a ""can do"" attitude--and reap the rewards of being an effective communicator."
5,gorgeous listening,"I had heard this group on public radio over the years and finally saw them live recently. That's when I bought this CD, along with several others by E.G. This one is my favorite - really beautiful, soulful music you will still enjoy after many listenings. A wonderful mix of ancient and modern interpretation."
5,beautiful,"Sheer beauty, as a lover of English music I found this to be one of the most beautiful of all Shakespearean albums. Such harmony, such subtlety, one wishes that the gentle night will never stop."
4,snake charming music,"I bought this music CD by Ensemble Gallilei for ""The Asp"" written and performed by Jan Hagiwara. I think the piece is one of the highlights of the CD. The music is evocative and beautifully played, and I hope to hear more of her works."
4,I didn't know that you could make a guitar sound like that -,"Stand back and watch as the Minneapolis Music scene rears it's ever so tuneful head to rise from the pop rock ashes with this debut album by The Vestals!Yes, it's true, the Twin Cities music scene hasn't been quite the same since the mid-eighties, however, this gem of a record shows that not all hope has died. One part Guided by Voices, one part Strokes....one quick listen to ""Three Girls Ago"" will have you hooked and humming the chorus for WEEKS! This is power pop that is miles above the rest.Heavy rotation is highly recommended with periodical doses of live intervention....This album is better than pink lemonade!"
3,The Hungary Ocean,"I would have to say that the book ""The Hungry Ocean"" by Linda Greenlaw is the book I would like to read. I would like to read this book because it tells of the dangers, the equipment used in fishing and I would like to hear it from a woman captains perspective. I think it is cool that a woman is a captain of one of the best fishing boats on the east coast and not to mention is the sister boat to the Andrea Gail the boat that went down in the Mother of all Storms in 1991."
4,Mesmerizing...a GREAT book,"Greenlaw writes so well, I read this book in one sitting. How wonderful that someone who is so skilled as a fisherman turns out to have such a gift for prose; the combination of talents has produced a unique book...it was truly an armchair traveler's trip to sea. But the title is a bit misleading, since the focus of the book is not on the awesome power of the ocean to take, but rather the tenacity of the fishermen who take fish from it. Altogether a wonderful book."
4,An excellent primer on longline fishing and a quick read,"I enjoyed this book immensely, and perhaps a bit better than Perfect Storm. This is factual and informative and a highly enjoyable read. Give it a shot: you won't be sorry."
3,"This book was informative, and educational","Laura Greenlaw was interviewed on a NPR program in my state of NH, and I was intrigued by her story. I was also prompted to buy the book after reading ""The Perfect Storm."" I found her reading to be a little too technical, and dry in areas, pertaining to specifics that I felt the reader did not really need to know. I was interested in her perspective being the captain of a ship and being a woman, which she appeared to minimize, much to my dismay. However, I did like parts of this book that related to her adventures on the sea, her relations with her crew, the massive coordination efforts involved in maintaining a ship, and the relationship with other ships that she was competing with for swordfish. I was hoping to get more ""bang for my buck,"" but I still found the book to be informative and interesting to read."
4,"Not ""Two Years Before The Mast"", but still worthy of a read","With so much hype linking this book to ""The Perfect Storm"", it was inevitable that many reviewers would be disappointed. However, read as the journal of a fisherman who happens to be a woman, it kept me engaged from start to finish. It is an easy read, and I don't read quickly. Thus, for the more proficient reader, this can easily be read in one day or over a short weekend. I have a cousin who is the innkeeper of a B&B in a New England port town. I'm forwarding this hard-cover edition to her so she can add it to the library at the B&B. I think her visitors would enjoy reading this while visiting a New England fishing town."
4,More informative than fun,"I read this book after reading Linda's second book ""Lobster Chronicles"". I enjoyed ""The Hungry Ocean"", but did not find it to be as much fun as her second release.This book included much more technical information, rather than focusing on the characters and anecdotal incidents. However, the book was still a great read!Linda vividly illustrates life on a swordfishing boat. It's dirty, exhausting and dangerous. But, it's also easy to understand why she loves it much. She captures the thrill of the unknown, the beauty of the ocean, and the excitement of steaming home with thousands of dollars worth of fish.The life described in this book could not be more different than my own. I enjoyed taking a look!"
2,Plodder. Captures boredom at sea.,"I am not too familiar with commercial fishing. I was looking for an engaging book on the topic. What I got was a book that effortlessly captured the boredom and tedium of life at sea. Anyway, I learned some stuff (but it wasn't fun)."
5,LETS CATCH SOME SWORDFISH,This is about catching swordfish with linda greenlaw the author great book for a newbie on the subject i believe this by far is her best book. Also has a little bit about her sister boat from the perfect storm another great book (by sebastian junger).
1,do not read this book if you care about the planet,"The literary values of the book are few or non-existent. The reader that could be interested will be probably a commercial fisherman. If you do not understand why a tale of butchery, animal cruelty or brutal exploitation of a disappearing fauna gets published do not buy it or,if it is too late, do not read it."
2,"Mediocre, at best","After being encouraged to read this book by a sailing friend, I picked it up with hope. I am disappointed. It's tedious. To mention this book alongside The Perfect Storm is just wrong. But it's a great book to read when you're trying to fall asleep."
1,"A Perfect Storm it Isn't, A Perfect Bore Maybe","I really enjoyed The Perfect Storm. So, I gave Ms. Greenlaw the benefit of the doubt and started her book. I was less than impressed. I lasted till page 53 where I just ran out of patience with her plodding technique and her lack of story.This is a bad book attempting to ride on the tail of Junger's book.Sebastian Junger's blurb on the cover was ""Anyone who loves the sea will love this book"" I think not."
2,Brutal,"This book was a quick read. I grew to seriously resent the captain and her crew for their callous and inhumane handling of the freshly caught [live] fish. Most disturbing was the hanging of the ""blue dog"" (shark) from the rafters, where he was stabbed repeatedly by the crew while thrashing and then doused with lighter fluid and set afire while alive. Why? To teach the sharks a lesson because they were being caught, instead of swordfish. She had surely become desensitized to the sufferings of animals, but having said that, I do believe she never was sensitive to begin with. I'm glad she has ""retired"" from the sea and and so are the fish I'm sure."
2,Hungry Ocean-Greedy Fishermen,"This book is a direct capitalization on Jungers book.It is also a poor facsimile of his work. I kept waiting for it to grab me in the way The Perfect Storm did. However much to my dismay, it never did. It leads me to believe that if The Perfect Storm was never written, this book wouldn't have been either. Miss Greenlaw fails to explain how the Atlantic longliners are decimating the billfish population.That is,the depletion of the swordfish and other game fishes are a direct result of their lack of concern. This viewpoint of my did not however influence my opinion of this book. I was very disappointed with this read."
4,a look at the fishing industry and the characters involved,a wonderful thought provoking book into the life and lifestyles of the american fisherman along with a look at the competitive nature of the fishing industry.
4,DID NOT WANT IT TO END,LINDA MADE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WERE ON A BOAT WITH HER AND HER CREW. I ENJOYED THE FRANKNESS IN HER FEELINGS AS SHE WROTE. IT GAVE SO MUCH CREDIBILITY TO HER AS A WRITER AS WELL AS A SWORDBOAT CAPTAIN.
5,A Perfect Book,"Maybe more technical than a ""Perfect Storm"", but just as exciting, informative, and overall well written."
2,Disappointing. Where's the story?,"After reading this I wondered why a publisher saw fit to make Greenlaw's tale into a book. It would have been better suited as a long magazine article. Sebastian Junger told us all that we really need to know about swordfishing -- and he wrapped his technical details of fishing, weather, and ocenaography around a gripping tale. What Greenlaw needed was a story -- this book is little more than a fluffed up practice in expository writing. It's probably worth the 11.43 or so that Amazon is getting for it, but don't pay full list as I did."
4,"Terrific Book, Extremely Well-Written","This was a very well-written book which did a terrific job of detailing life on a month long swordfishing expedition. The relationships among the crew and between the deckhand and the female captain are vividly portrayed. There are several passages where you can literally smell the oil, fish and salt air. Highly recommended."
2,Linda stick with Fishing,"I read ""The Perfect Storm"" with great excitement. I read ""The Hungry Ocean"" with little enthusiasm. Having spent 2 years on a Coast Guard Icebreaker in the North Pacific and the Bering Sea on search and rescue I understand the demands on fishermen however Linda did a poor job of relaying this message. I think she needs to stick with fishing and leave the writing to others. This book was a real waste of money. Web"
2,I went into this book predisposed to like it. Wrong!,"I found this book interesting, especially the ""Mug-Ups"" until the author describes how crewmates on a previous trip once took revenge on a string of bad catch days. The crew was sick of catching sharks instead of swordfish, so they decided to lift morale by retailating! One offending shark who had the audacity to bite onto a baited long line hook was hung over the water by a noose, knifed and set afire while the crew cheered its thrashing and suffering. Sicko city. The author seems to have little empathy for animals or humans. It was torture to read about the crewmate who was so sick he could not get up, while the author waxes nostalgic about how it was so important to get the boss's praise by filling the hold with fish, whether the crew was sick or not!"
4,The Hungry Ocean: A Swordboat Captain's Journey,"The Hungry Ocean piqued and at many times satisfied my new found interest in the salt water fishing trade. The author personalized activity and life aboard the vessel just enough, without going overboard. The many technical aspects of the book were spelled out without being too rudementary and yet the book contained enough ""human"" element that the reader could not get bogged down in the technical information."
2,"Terrible grammar, okay story","I am listening to this book. Greenlaw has made the mistake of reading it herself. She's a terrible reader. She swallows words and stops in the middle of sentences. Plus her writing ain't the greatest. I don't mean her storytelling, which is good. I mean that her sentence structure is awful and if I hear her say ""lay"" once more when she means ""lie,"" I'll scream. Where was the editor?"
2,"Informative, but not very exciting....","This is one of those books you really want to like, but is isn't that good. It's very informative when it comes to how fishing actually is, but it comes out sounding like just another day at the office. Some illustrations would have helped because they whole leader, haulback, beeper stuff was way too confusing.If you really want a good book, stick to the Perfect Storm."
5,Page turning..,"Great book for all the ocean loving people..The amount of skill, knowledge, fortitude needed to be a fisherman. Linda Greenlaw sures wins accolades for her management style and honesty in this book."
4,A geat book from start to finish,I enjoyed the book because Linda tells the story of life a swordfishning boat and what it is really like. She doesn't try to glorify her job or the jobs of her crew. She gives the reader a great taste of what it like to work on one of these boats and how hard it really is. I felt she was very honest in the fact that to take a boat out like that for a month at a time can be very demanding. It also lets the readers know that life on one of these boats is not a party. For those of us who have thought about running off to become a fisherman on the seven seas it shows us just how tough it could be.Good luck to Linda and I'm sure whatever she decides to do in the future she will meet with great success.
5,When experience speaks...........,"Yes, I did pick up this book because of the movie. It turned out not to be a bad decision at all. Linda Greenlaw speaks of experience the majority of us can only imagine. You can smell the salt air, the fish, the diesel fumes, the crew. She has described it all perfectly and has drawn you into her world and captures your most inner curiosities of the world of swordfishing. So entrapped was I that I could not put this book down when finished, I immediately read her next book The Lobster Chronicles which was just as enthralling. Buy it, read it, cast of the lines of your imagination and ply the open ocean with Linda, you will not be disappointed."
4,Good Description of Life of a Fisherman,"an easy read, that lets land-lovers get a feeling for what it's like to be in close quarters with a small crew for 30 days and having to battle boredom, hard work, personalities, and the ocean while worrying about family, the future, and staying alive."
1,Riding Jungers coat tails,"Greenlaws book does give one a sense of what it's like on a longliner, but clearly she is not the writer Sebastian Junger is. She starts a story well, building to a climax then leaves you flat. She tells of tension building between crew members, asks one to stop tormenting another and his reply? ""ok"" and that's it! I simply expected more of a book so long on the NY Times best seller list.. The perfect Storm was what I like to call ""a ripping yarn"". This was flat and only mildly interesting."
4,Very interesting...,"Linda Greenlaw at times sounded a little 'phony' at times and the book (near the end) becomes slightly disturbing, but that would probably be my only critisism. Her obvious love of fishing is quite aparent and the lives of her crew that she intrically weaves into her story are quite interest too. The ""mug-ups"" were entertaining after 'spending a day fishing.' Overall quite a good book, and a great story to read after 'The Perfect Storm.'"
2,Equivocando el camino con eso del remaster,"Sin duda ""Los Violadores"" son un grupo muy bueno, pero las canciones en esta oportunidad no son la mejor version, muchas de ellas de un estilo lento. Trataron, sin exito, de subir una calidad musical que no corresponde.Recomiendo personalmente tratar de buscar las versiones originales, con este CD uno queda con gusto a nada."
4,RE-RECORDED OLD HITS,"That's what this cd is about.Being a foreign band,this is of no interest whatsoever for anybody except the most die-hard of argentinian Violadores' fans.The original versions of the songs are way better,but it may be interesting as a low budget comp."
4,Urban Romances VS. Mothering,"Supporting The Sky is funny, sad, bleak, hopeful, and graceful, all wrapped up in one book.Reading it is much like riding a roller coaster. You can see the big dips, hills and hair pin turns long before you get to them. However, that doesn't reduce the surprises or thrills of the ride. Griffith uses extensive foreshadowing. Yet leaves pleanty of room for guessing the who, when and where.Although, the story plays out around a few key violent crimes and their aftermath, the true focal point is the complexity of a mother - teenage daughter relationship."
3,Solid recording of short lived Basie ensemble.,"Another(!) great SAGA JAZZ disc. Excellent liner notes. This version of Basie's band is not as swinging as the Rushing Era Basie, but still swings pretty hard, although there are some quieter tracks. Great work music."
1,A Book with No Ending,"Clearly, the other reviewers have not read this book. I have read many Ralph Compton books. This was not my favorite, but I knew it would have a decent ending. But the book just stops! Right near the end of the story. Unbelievable! On page 347 (the last page of the chapter) Wes and El Lobo are preparing to go after their kidnapped wives. On the other side of the page is an advertisement for some of Ralph Compton's previous books. There is not even an advertisement for a sequel. Just more advertisements for other Penquin/Signet paperbacks. The book was printed in January 1998. It is almost as if Ralph Compton died in mid-sentence and someone forgot to finish the book."
2,Fragmented and proprietary,"Mark White can clearly upgrade the 10/22 into an interesting firearm, but not likely applicable to most 10/22 owners. Some of this book might be useful, and most might be interesting, but it lacks basics and dwells on the esoteric.White spends considerable space with barrel machining, which most of us cannot do, and suppressors, which, though interesting, are marginally legal, require federal registration, illegal in many states, and beyond the machining capabilities of most 10/22 owners.Things we CAN do are generally ignored, especially installing new barrels and stocks, which are easily within the capabilities of most 10/22 owners and given only passing mention in this ""Ultimate"" guide book. There is NO mention of procedures for checking inletting on stocks, barrel floating, or determining allowable contact points between the receiver and barrel and stock, all critical to the 10/22 owner who might purchase a ""100% drop-in"" barrel and stock combination."
2,A bit of a disappointment...,"Actually, more than a bit. I was looking for an authoritative reference manual, but I got a summary of tweaks and idealogy about silencers as a great idea for pest control.Reading this book was clearly influenced by my having read ""The Gun Digest Book of .22 Rimfire"" by James E. House. There is simply no comparison between the two books. Admittedly, the House book is more general in that it covers a wide range of rimfire firearms and does not go into great ""tweak"" detail. That focus was left to House's new book ""Customized the Ruger 10/22"" which I should be receiving from Amazon on August 25, 2006.If House's book on customizing the 10/22 is anywhere near as complete and smartly written as his "".22 Rimfire"" book turned out to be, then buying the ""Ultimate Ruger 10/22 Manual and User's Guide"" will be less valuable than it turned out to be."
1,disappointing,totally not the information I was seeking. I wanted an easy reference for building a target weapon. this is more into heavy gunsmithing and silencers?
3,Ultimate Ruger 10/22 is useful,"This manual and users guide was useful.Some of the mods will be beyond the kitchen table gunsmiths relm,such as threading the receiver for a threaded barrel.But most of the information is within the weekend gunsmiths ability.Most of the mods make using the Ruger 10/22 easier to use.I think this book is more for the person that is looking for a more compact and quiet varmit control firearm."
3,Almost great,"For the $15 and change from Amazon to your mail box, it is a reasonable value. For anyone that has not been in the middle of the Ruger 10/22 action, it is good. If it had two more pictures that I found on the internet, it would border on very good.The author's (M. White) opinions on bullet stability vs velocity are inconsistent with results I have obtained at the shooting range. He also seems bent on flaunting his class what ever it is FFL and that he can have/manufacture silencers. Unnecessary."
1,The Ultimate Ruger 10/22 Manuak And...,I am so sorry there must be a redeeming value to this Magazine size booklet. There are no pictures worth seeing PERIOD! The Manual from Ruger in PDF online for free is much Much Better. You would think that for someone who is supposed to be building silencers for the Ruger 10/22 he might show a photo of the parts of a can. Nope not one. So I called BATF No License to do this type of work is listed. hmmmmmm For a society that lives on the piece if paper such as a license is that you could find out info on said practice for the repair of firearms or the construction of silencers. NADA nope not even. Makes ya think the story is not of the whole cloth. dray
2,for fun only,"This is an adorable book with cute recipes, but it states at the outset that they are intended to be fed once a week as a change from kibble (later it says 2 or 3 times a week). There is no nutritional information and there is no attempt made to show you how to feed your dog a solely home-cooked diet, which is what I was looking for. I got a lot better guidance from ""Barker's Grub"" and Dr. Pitcairn's book in switching my dogs over from commercial food."
3,Good beginner's book. Not for the long haul,"I picked this up on a whim just after I adopted my dog. I've been feeding my cats a homemade diet using Feline Future for years now. This is a very cute book. A very fun book. But it is NOT a very healthy book. It advocates a lot of highly processed ingredients. Refined white rice and refined white bread. Corn meal. These are not good for your dog.It says nothing about whole, fresh, organic ingredients. Vitamins. Nutrients.If you're looking to get started, this book is a good one for beginners. Although some of the recipes are far too ingredient heavy."
1,Fatal Flaw - no serving sizes.,"Some good treats in here, but if you want to feed your dog from this recipe book, you'll need to prepare a meal, then burn it in a calorimeter so you can find out how many calories that meal has - then you'll need to find out how many calories a day your dog needs. The best way to find that information would be to look on the side of a bag of dog food I guess.Seriously, how can you make a cookbook for dogs and not include suggested serving sizes for the recipes based on the dog's weight and age?Ultimately, that makes this book useless for anything other than novelty treats and an occasional cooked meal. You can't put together a realistic diet for your dog from this book."
4,cookbook for dogs,"I like this book. However, I was looking for a cookbook so I could soley cook for my dog. It promotes dry kibble to mix in with the food, which defeats the purpose of it. It's a nice book though and I will use it as a reference."
5,Great Book packed with info on cooking healthy for the 'kids'.,Bought this book to provide a more varied diet for my four-footed 'kids'. Great book packed with lots of good information and well balanced recipes. So glad I bought it as I am now confident that the diet fed to my 'kids' is well balanced and healthy.
2,Real JUNK food for dogs,"The title claims that there are 50 vet approved recipes here which would lead one to believe that the recipes are healthy, right? Wrong. I don't know a single vet that would recommend these recipes to any dog owner.I'm a professional dog trainer who cooks for my own dogs. I'm very concerned about their nutritional needs and have become familiar with what's good and what's not so good for dogs. This recipe book is LOADED with not-so-good recipes for your dog. As a once in a while snack or treat, I suppose it's okay, but even then, I wouldn't feed my dog many of the recipes in this book. It's mostly junk food and the recipes call for items that aren't good for dogs, such as corn.I highly recommend The Whole Pet Diet: Eight Weeks to Great Health For Dogs and Cats by Andi Brown and Barker's Grub by Rudy Edalati over this one. Both of these books offer healthy, wholesome recipes for meals, snacks and supplements that will provide your precious pets with the nutrition they need."
5,cooking for dogs,"I bought this as a gift for a family that has a dog with allergies. Between medications and Vet visits it gets expensive to feed him. I suggested they ditch the processed food and cook what dogs can eat. Commercial pet food isn't exactly cheap. It's cheaper to get the kids to cook for him and he loves it. The book comes up with practical advise, little known facts and recipes you wouldn't think of yourself. It even has DESSERTS. Their oldest daughter does the cooking so far.She started with a dessert. It's fun for the family, and you get a chance to taste it. Who would do that with a can of (whatever?) So, what's not to like?It arrived quickly in gd shape."
1,A waste of a click on the mouse,When you have Vet approved dog meals you would think it would be something your dog would eat daily.I consider this book as something of a joke and a rip.......
3,Real dog food.,Recipies are there. It's oki if you have the time to cook for your beloved pet. Very few pages. I gave it away.
1,Vital information missing,"To feed your pet healthy food you need to know the calories and the portions. To cook a sufficient amount, you need to know the number of sized servings per recipe. This book gives none of this vital information."
2,NOT WHAT MY VET RECOMMENDS,"I bought this book because I was scared to death to buy any more dog food from the stores after the poisoned stuff showed up from CHINA...which is a bad place to get ANY food from.I showed it to my vet. He confirmed what I already felt after reading it...it is NOT a good book to feed your dog from on a regular basis. It is ok for an occasional cooked meal; but not for regular consumption. The recipes do not contain wholesome ingredients, and do contain salt and other things not good, and are too fattening. The treat section is good. I made some treats from the book and my dogs loved them. I made one of the meal recipes and only one of my dogs spit it on the floor...but she spits EVERYTHING on the floor if it isn't to her liking, and being a Shih-Tzu, NOTHING is to her liking,lol.Anyway, it is an OK book for an occasional cooked meal treat or for making your own treats, but not healthy to give your dog on a regular basis....according to a Vet with degrees lining his walls."
4,Excellent,This book is very useful which include variety recipes for dogs. Those recipes are easy to make and save time to prepare. My dog really like it.
3,"Cute, but not amazing","I like this book. I feel like a lot of the recipes could be found on the internet. I was also hoping for easy things to make using items that are commonly found in everyday houses. This was not the case for my pantry. I will need to do a whole lot of shopping to make most of the suggested food items for my pups. The illustrations are entertaining, but it is a little different than when I was expecting."
5,Puppies gone wild....,"I bought this book to give my two puppies some variety in food and because they are getting bored with certain foods. They go wild for this stuff. It's as if they know I'm cooking for them. They will patiently sit in the kitchen with me until it's finished. They even lick the bowls clean, no wasted food here."
2,Cute...,"Cute book, has some interesting recipes to 'shake it up' for your dog,however, the recipes aren't health conscious, a little more research in that direction would have made it a better book. Dr. Pitcairn's ""Complete Guide to Natural Health For Dogs & Cats"" is a far superior book on this topic. I combined recipes from both books leaning towards healthful choices."
3,Information needed,"I bought this book and began reading recipes. When an addition of bone meal was listed, it did not mention that this should be human quality, not the gardening variety.I was concerned at one of the recipes that listed 4 boullion cubes which is a great amount of salt - neither good for human or animal.I think more clarity is needed, but it did give me a start on preparing my own foods."
3,Good but....,I think a book should have dailly suggested portions based on your pets weight and breed and this one does not have that. Being that your main concern should be your friends health and weight. Other wise it has some very good info on what work.
2,unbalanced,"I was very excited to get a cook book that I could start making my own fresh dog food. But in speaking with my vet, I now understood what type of research goes into Dog Cookbooks. It was actually scary that really not much research has been done. In fact we may cook dog food, but it is not balanced. These books do not show that dogs need bone meal, or vitamins. The Dog food cooks books are more for human enjoyment than actual nutrition for our canine loves."
3,Good ideas,"This book isn't exactly what I thought it would be...its really just a cookbook. It has some basic and some complex recipes - most of which would be for special occasions or maybe doable if your only cooking for small dogs (that don't eat that much)(I have 2 big dogs and most of these recipes are not feasible on a budget.) There are a few tips about dog health and nutrition but this is not a good guide for that. I recomend you use it as a cookbook companion to ""The nature of animal healing."""
2,Disappointed,"While I think some of the recipes are good wholesome recipes. I am a little alarmed to see salt as an ingredient in many of the recipes. Also bouillon cubes are used frequently, and those have a lot of salt. Some of the recipes use premade dough as well. If you do that, you don't know what kinds of preservatives or other ingredients are in them that may not bee good for our 4 legged friends."
1,No Rice For Dogs!,"Simply stated, dogs are carnivores. They would never eat rice or wheat or cheese{!} in the wild. I advocate for home made diets but not anything with grains. You could be making your dog just as sick. Don't feed grains!From a list of poisons for dogs:""GarlicMuch like onions, Garlic contains thiosulphate, the dangerous toxin that poisons dogs. However garlic is also good for dogs in small amounts as it acts as a natural flea repellant. Use garlic in tiny portions and in strict moderation."""
1,Real Food for Dogs: 50 Vet-Approved Recipes to Please the Canine Gastronome,This book has wrong information in it and the author should really think about re-writing the book. I have returned the book to the store purchased. As I have been feeding a home cooked meals and RAW food for 4 plus years and have had no issues with raw feeding. Get your facts start.
5,Quikrete Concrete Pigment Quality,"I was amazed at how fast I got this order filled through Ace Hardware.I've found Quikcrete concrete pigment to be consistent in every bottle.There are a few things I learned about making concrete using pigment, the most important that you must keep your clean water measuring tool away from the pigment and that you must add the pigment to the water before you add it to the concrete. And don't rush with mixing it thinking that the concrete will be dry before you get a chance to use it. It doesn't happen instantaneously. If you are prepared with all you need you will enjoy the work and have a great result."
5,Beautiful.,Beignet Yisrael is truly original and a wonderful CD. I have had the priviledge of meeting these musicians and seeing them live. This CD is a must for every Jew.
5,I love this album. Why can't I find one?,"I have to repeat myself I love this album. It just takes my breath away every time I hear it. I lent it to someone who I felt had to hear it, got distracted with other events in life over a few years & don't remember who I lent it to! I miss it so much. Please make a download, something!! Thanks very much."
3,Interesting but not desktop friendly,"I have read the Sacred Path of the Warrior twice and value the book. I have tried to integrate these teachings into my daily life. That is why I wanted to get the cards, to have a daily reminder of the teachings before me, to reinforce my practice. Unfortunately, the cards are so large that it is impractical, at least for me, to have them displayed on my desk top. A smaller, sturdier set would have been more useful to me."
5,Amazing read! Keep your mind open.,"Beautifully written and easy to apply to every day life if you are willing and ready to walk a path of sacredness, compassion, respect, thoughtfulness and absolute fearlessness. The path of a Warrior. This book made me personally see that my body, mind and spirit are most often times not unified. But now, I am more aware of this so I may put effort into doing so as well as recognize those that are also living this path, whether they are conscious of it or not. This has put into words what is my heart's ultimate desire: to be a part of the movement towards Enlightened Society. And any effort towards that, big or small, makes an impact. I have come to realize there are no mundane daily tasks."
3,"not as good as his other works,","such as 'Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism', which is a very good read. His words in this book are not very concise and he never goes deep into his topics. It is much like a cliff notes for 'The Road Less Traveled' - by Scott Peck. If you want to read about how to live everyday life, go for Scott Peck. If you are looking for a book on Zen or meditation read 'Zen Mind, Beginners Mind'. Shambhala wasnt a terrible book, but it wasnt a life changing, thought inspiring one either. Hope this review helped!"
5,"R U ""one who is brave""?","this is a well written modern guide book by a buddhist master. he goes well beyond the old sectarian views of religion and brings the reader into the picture in clear focus. he challenges us to be all we can be and to understand more deeply than before the wonders and joys of being fully human. this is a wonderful research and development tool for the independent thinker. the author challenges us to do good and trust our innermost instincts and intuitions. and he provides many tools and ideas to help us be successful spiritual warriors. [warrior = ""one who is brave.""] this is timeless wisdom all wrapped up in the universal laws of harmony. anyone who reads and takes this book to heart may well walk a little taller, see a little clearer, listen more, talk less, feel joy."
3,The jury is still out,"I've read this book three times and took Shambala Training. Many years ago, I saw a young girl sitting on a park bench reading this book. I thought ""uh-oh!"" Chogyam Trungpa was considered one of the greatest meditation masters in American Buddhism. The Karmapa approved of him totally. He was a brillant man who understood the inhibitions and neurosis of Westerners possibly better than any teacher who has taught Tibetan Buddhism in the West. He helped me a great deal. I no longer became embarrassed about being a human being. His books are and were great. But sadly enough, we have to face facts. I have talked to many many people in the last twenty years who knew him. His conduct was, to say the least, deplorable. He constantly violated four out of the five Buddhist precepts. Buy the book. All of Trungpa's books and his teachings were fundamentally kind and compassionate. Just do what the Dalai Lama suggests. Be wary with any personal teacher. Best of luck."
3,Good book for what it is.,"Not one of my favorites, but I'm not a super spiritual person. Has some good insight on living simply. Could have been half the length and I would have been happy."
1,This is a waste of money!,"As a part of a cake-decorating class, my wife makes two batches of icing every week. Unfortunately, the sifting of the powdered sugar is time consuming and hard on the hands and wrists. This electric sifter seemed like the perfect solution. It works by quicly rotating a metal screen back in forth in a vibrating motion. The idea is that this vibration will encourage whatever powder you place in the top to fall through the screen, mixed and seperated. It's performance, however, was laughable. Install the single AA battery, add some powdered sugar, press the button, and watch in amazement as the device buzzes and rattles like an electric sander while one-by-one the grains of sugar drop into the waiting bowl. We gave up on it after more than a minute of the anoying sound had produced about a half a cup of sifted sugar. Please don't waste your precious time or money on this cheaply made toy of an appliance."
5,This CD Rocks!,"I don't know about you, but from time to time I find myself humming the music to DOOM, even years after I've last played it. It's always hovering there at the edge of my subconscious.DOOM was also the first game that gave me serious heebie-jeebies while playing it -- 2AM, the sub-woofer cranked, zombie guards in the next room labored breathing. Yikes!I kept thinking to myself: ""Wouldn't it be cool if I could get the music from the original game on CD."" I tried a while ago and just found some busted MIDI's. Recently I checked Amazon, thinking what the hell (no pun intended), and lo and behold ""DOOM Music"".If anything I've said rings true to you, buy this CD! Buy it now! Relive the nightmares!"
5,Should appeal to more than gaming fans,"This is one of the better instrumental albums I have, although I admit the almost totally synthesized sound of it puts me off at times. Missing some of the better songs off of Doom and Doom 2, but has enough of the greats that that isn't a problem. From spy-themed to ambient classical to spooky new age to 80s-era metal, the music on this album is varied enough that something or other on it ought to appeal to everybody."
2,Not great,"This was something of a disappointing. The music for Doom was ace - ultra-cheesy mid-80's 'hair metal' that would benefit from a thorough reworking by a real guitar band. This, on the other hand, is just a recording of the MIDI soundtrack to the game, with some added sound effects and a splash of reverb. That's it. On the one hand, it's cheap, but on the other hand it's useless as music, unless you treat it as a cheesy object d'art."
5,"awesome, a must have","Had this on my amazon wish list for 6 years. Sadly, amazon didn't come through, but I was able to finally find a mint condition one on the net.That said, it's an awesome cd. Yes, the midis are available, but they don't always sound like the cd does."
4,Takes Me Back To 1993,"Aaaah, the sounds of DOOM. Perfectly mastered especially for the DOOMer with a CD player. Bobby Prince has created music and sound effects for such games as DOOM and Duke Nukem. I believe he also did a low-budget movie called ""Squirm"" way back when. This was also one of make-up FX guru Rick Baker's (""An American Werewolf In London"") earlier movies. Anyway, I still play DOOM and I love it. Now, with this CD, I can hear it anytime I want and in rich, CD sound."
4,"Now do this to ""Rise of the Triad""","This is some great music while your playing or doing anything. Some of the great doom songs weren't actually on this cd, but it's still great. Though I still prefer Lee Jackson over Bobby Prince (which they know each other quite well)."
4,Half the Good Stuff is Missing!,"I'll admit that most of the selections on the CD rock, but some of the best tracks aren't included on the CD, specifically E1M2 (the second level of the Original Doom). When I think of Doom I think of that track, and it's not even on this CD.Disappointed!Still, the music does bring back the memories...late nights, lights turned off, playing that level just one more time, getting the bejeezits scared out of me when I least expected it, multi-player mayhem...and the unmistakable devastation of the best done double-barreled shotgun in First-Person history!Doom may be ancient in PC terms, but it changed the way we play games today, and this music couldn't be any more ingrained in my head.I want my E1M2!"
3,Not as described,"My son had been looking for HO boats for his train table. When coming upon this one we decided to get it as HO boats are hard to come by. Unfortunatley there is nothing stating that this is a die cast boat that needed to be painted and put together. Needless to say, there was one very disappointed little boy, who didn't get to place it on his train table as soon as it arrived."
4,True story of a courageous man.,"Martin Niemoller was truly one of the Righteous Gentiles. Interesting reading, even if sometimes a little dry. Either before or after reading this book, you should also read Crowns, Crosses, and Stars: My Youth in Prussia, Surviving Hitler and a Life Beyond, written by Sibylle Niemoller, his second wife."
1,CAVEAT EMPTOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this book, which i believed to be legit when I purchased it, is a right wing ,and I mean right wing[other titles, the civil war was right,the south was correct to secede Nathan bedford Forest, well you get it. It opens with a bizarre introduction talking about Whittiker Chambers,Alger hiss's boy toy and pumpkin eater and Margret Sanger founder of planned parenthood and a racist, and then talking about the left and...sigh.What is this crapola? how come this book is not listed as true by the Niemoller family?this is fiction, I reckon.I want a refund.BEWARE"
2,A weak offering - there are much better books,"This book has some snippets of good advice, so I had to at least give it 2 stars.I can't give it any more than that, though, because the material is pretty weak. Basically, one of the authors runs classes to teach parents how to better communicate with their children (though is apparently not a degreed counselor). The other author is a writer who decided that these techniques could also be useful in dealing with an uncooperative ex.I can't say they're completely wrong about this - after all, good communication comes in handy anywhere. But this makes for a very shaky premise. There's no research behind it, and they don't even bring any clinical experience with using these techniques in this situation!(Plus, don't let your kids see the title. I threw the book out, considering that there was very little value compared to the risk that the kids would see it.)For a sound book on the same topic, try ""Mom's House, Dad's House"" by Isolina Ricci."
1,Flash In The Pan,"Each piece of advice worked the first time. I think it was because I was breaking the old patterns when I responded and she was caught off guard. By the next time we communicated she had a new way to shut me down. I stuck to the plan for a month, then gave it up. I would have needed to go to counseling after every confrontation. She has the ability to mutate faster than a super virus. I was amused but not helped by Joint Custody With a Jerk."
3,Not for you if your ex really is a jerk,"If this claimed to be a primer for communication in emotionally charged situations, it would be great. If you're in a situation where neither of you really have your emotions under control, but you're open minded, and have the slightest care if the other person is upset, it might help. Ironically, it's actually really helping my husband and I whenever we have a bump. But if your ex is a jerk? No. If your ex is manipulative? Controlling? Dishonest? Well, this book generously condescends to tell you the title of the professional that you have to (and here's the catch) get them to see. That's all it offers, not even a technique to get them there."
1,I Could Never Buy This Book,"I, too, agree with ""A Reader"" who thinks that the title of this book is completely inappropriate. Who could possibly keep this book in the house and risk having a child see it? Calling the other parent a jerk is not going to help anyone. Clearly a publishing gimmick - too bad, because it overshadows what seems like potentially decent advice."
1,uhh...not sure!!,"Ok..I bought this book a month ago today. I still have not received it! Ive written to the seller about it and of course...no response. So my review on this book is....WHO KNOWS, I cant read it because I NEVER got it! No one will refund me or send this to me."
1,Title Sends Wrong Message,"I would not purchase this book, with this title. Perhahs I think the Ex is a jerk. But, I certainly would not let the children know I felt that way. Purchasing a book with this title would imply to the children I felt this way. Divorce is confusing enough for children, why set an example that name calling is appropriate in any dispute?"
4,friends with a jerk,"have not finished reading the book. wish i read this years ago, maybe i could have save myself some aggravating moments..."
1,How To Inflame The Situation. Should be the title of this book.,"One parenting acting like a jerk is bad enough. Advising the other parent to act like a jerk is not going to help the children.Be as kind to yourself, your children and your X as you can. Don't behave like a jerk or make things harder for any reason.Not recommended."
3,Great for most situations,"This book is great for most divorced couples with children. It helps you examine the motivations for the decisions you make about your child(ren) without basing those decisons on irrational emotions.However, I would not have ordered this book if I were privy to its scope beforehand because it admittedly offers little help for those dealing with abusive or deadbeat ex-spouses."
2,mixed bag,Most of the comments made are based on large assumptions about the dynamics of the relationships. I don't think it takes into account when you have an ex who isn't willing to work anything out. For such a circumstance I don't think this book really helps at all except understand your own feelings. I think I have a pretty good handle on my feelings and don't need any book to tell me how I feel or to help analyze myself for that matter. This book might help in trying to figure the ex out but in my opinion I think those are assumptions and opions as well and not neccessarily fact. If the author put in advice about legal options it might prove to be more useful.
4,"Simple, Practical, Easy Read","This book is pretty fun... especially for a not so fun situation. She doesn't make light of the issues surrounding the challenges of co-parenting, she helps you from taking yourself too seriously. She also plainly advises how to revise your communication tactics so as not to be too offensive. So, at some points you'll realize,""maybe my partner's not the only jerk amidst the circumstances."" It does take two to tango."
1,I always felt she was the jerk.,"Once I saw this book at my x-wife's apartment it became clear she was working a new program. I bought and read it and understood what she was trying to accomplish. What I found amusing was that, I always felt she was the jerk. It would have been easier on both of us if she had just been straight with me. This book would be valid if both parents had a copy. So it should only be sold in sets so both parents are headed in the same direction. Aggravating information on lying, blocking and refusing to be flexible should be removed from the text. A professional mediator could correct the problems with this book and make it really helpful. For now, it does not rate much consideration. Not recommended."
3,Joint Custody with a Jerk: Raising a Child with an Uncooperative Ex.,"The problem with this book: the uncooperative ex., aka jerk, is the one buying the book."
1,He Said She Said,"Should I rewrite your book and call it ""Joint Custody with a Bitch"" The title being inflammatory only adds to a problem that effect not only mothers but it also effects fathers. But maybe you should have thought that is effects 100% of the children prior to slapping your X because your children may not see the world through your angry eyes. Denigrating the father is punishable by law."
4,Satisfied customer,"Purchased this book, to find new ways on how to deal with an ex, regarding custody. The book was used but in very good condition. So far learned new tips and happy I made the purchase. Thank you."
2,Could have been better,They attempted to put a positive spin on the book by being cute. It did not work. It starts in the right direction but sometimes becomes more game playing. Take the good parts and ignore the rest.
3,Best to buy with Rune Haako,"If you have Rune Haako, then you need to get this toy to compliment him. But while Rune can move his arms around and is posable, Nute Gunray is covered by plastic robes that severley limit arm movement and posability. It's a great figure, but be aware that you can't do much more than display him."
3,"Typical, but good.","This is pretty much just what you would expect. A random collection of mid-90's alternative bands, some good, some ok. The bigger bands here are ""Bush"", ""Weezer"", ""Elastica"", ""Belly"", ""Sublime"", and ""Silverchair"", but most of the songs are good. The best thing though is the inserts from the movie. Most are funny, and make you recall the film pretty well. Anyone who likes this disc, should like ""Jay And Silent Bob Strike Back"" also. It's the same type of thing, with more diverse bands, and inserts as well."
2,Dead in a MALLRAT trap!,Like the movie this is not a good CD most of the songs are all lame and and the soundbites are not great! CLERKS is a much beter movie and soundtrack! If your a big fan of MALLRATS buy the CD if not Don't!
3,Typical representation of today's music...,"Typical representation of today's music...nothing great here. Best cuts are by Weezer, Elastica, Squirtgun and Sublime. Other bands doing so-so songs are Bush, Silverchair, Sponge, Wax, Belly, Girls Against Boys, All, Archers Love, and Thrush Hermit. There is also a cool cover of ""Build Me Up Buttercup"" by The Goops. Also includes lame dialogue from a lame movie."
3,Could Be Better,"As with any other computer terminology book I've browsed through, it seems that this book has terms that some others don't, and other books have some terms that this one doesn't. Also, another book will give a better definition of a certain term than this one may. Or vice versa. The solution...? If you really want to have as much of a database of comuter terms as possible, have two or more books. A book with the most definitions may not be the best, because the definitions may not be descriptive enough. so be careful! Keep in mind, new terms are coming out every day rendering the book obsolete. Finding a good website of computer terminology may be an additional method of finding what you need if it isn't in a book. The layman's language and general thouroughness of this book does make it a good choice."
2,"The idea of a computer dictionary is good,","The idea of a computer dictionary is good, but this author answers one technical term using a dozen others. This is NOT a way to clarify technical terms for beginners."
2,Not quite as erotic as I'd hoped for.,"While several of the stories were very interesting, only 2 or 3 of them were what can truly be labeled as ""erotica""."
4,Cute dolls but not the ones pictured...,The price is right and my daughter will still love this set but the dolls pictured are not the ones I received. One was the dark haired girl (pictured) and the other a blonde. Adorable faces on the dolls. As for being durable...I have not taken them out of the packaging yet as I am saving for Christmas. They look fine though especially for a girl who respects her dollies. Hope this helps.
4,Had no problems with it.,I bought this camera months ago and it works fine. I have no problem with the focusing. The picture quality is not bad either. I will insert a pic taken with this camera. The manual sucked at explaining how to work it. I had no problem with battery life. I bought rechargeable batteries with it and it works fine. I rated it four stars because of the video recording with no audio. Great cheap camera! I use it all of the time.
3,you get what you pay for,"The service from Amazon was excellent. I didn't expect the camera to be fancy and it's fine. The written instructions for using it are poor. It's perfect for someone who is not interested in taking picture after picture. It should be noted to the digital camera novice like me that it does not include a necessary storage card which though not cost-prohibitive caused me some delay. If I had noticed this absence when ordering the camera ,I would of ordered the memory from Amazon at the same time..I believe this is the manufacturer's fault but Amazon missed the opportunity to make a little more money and save the customer some time."
4,great reading,i read this book very good. she is a very good writer. need to find more books by her. cannot wait to read more of her stuff.
2,A little too explicit for my taste,"I'm not gay, so I'm for sure not into reading about gay/lesbian encounters. While I enjoyed ""Coffee Will Make You Black"" b/c I'm a sucker for coming of age stories, I did not have the same satisfaction with this sequel. I understand the point Ms. Sinclair is trying to make with how even as adults we are all trying to find ourselves in this big world and while that's all well and good I could have done without the details of the love scenes and other encounters. For example, the scene where she's finger-f***ing some other woman was a little unnecessary."
4,"Only a ""FOOL"" would pass this book up!","AIN'T GONNA BE THE SAME FOOL TWICE was a good sequel to COFFEE WILL MAKE YOU BLACK. Stevie's adventures in the land of race, the road, and her sexuality was amusing and provoking. The fact that she became honest with herself at the end make her journeys well worth the effort and worth my time reading."
4,Stevie Grows Up,"I read this book only because I had to find out what happend to our protagonist Stevie as she grew up and came out. I was left hanging at the end of ""Coffee Will Make You Black"" which forced me to read this book.This book deals with the pains and tribulations of coming out and finding oneself. Although a bit too idealistic, it still rings true here and there, and there are many interesting and diverse characters.I moderately enjoyed this book, but don't have any current plans to read any more of Ms. Sinclair's books."
2,Cliche and simplistic,"After having read ""Coffee will make you black,"" I was looking forward to this book. I found it much too cliche. The subject matter was fine, but the treatment of it just left me cold and I never managed to get into the soul of any of the characters. I felt I knew Stevie much better after the first book. I felt this book had been written in a bumper sticker factory."
1,I just couldn't identify...,I read April's first book and liked it. I just could not get into this sequel. The subject matter just did not pull me in.
1,Stinks,I found this book to be a complete let down. The book was very shallow and made no real direction. I think that April Sinclair's writing ability is good but the plot and story line of this book are a mess. Without giving away too much about this book I just want to say that no one can do it like E. Lynn Harris.
3,What Happened????,"I couldn't wait to get the follow-up to ""Coffee will make you black""When I saw ""Ain't gonna be the same fool twice"" I grabbed it.I ran home and started reading it. I kept waiting for the story plot to thicken.It never happened. I didn't even pass this one on to me sister-in-law.Too embarrased."
3,Slightly Second Rate,"Review by A'Ja Lyons""Ain't Gonna Be The Same Fool Twice"" by April Sinclair is the sequel to her novel ""Coffee Will Make You Black."" The story follows main character Jean `Stevie' Stevenson as she begins college and redefines everything she thought she knew about herself. Stevie finds herself pursuing her first lesbian relationship and truly experimenting with her feelings towards women. She encounters another lesbian of color who becomes her guide to gay politics, drugs, and love-making. Her freshman year of college in the Midwest in the 1970s also finds her having to struggle with the racism that was rampant in those states in those times.I found the book to be slightly second-rate, merely half as interesting as the previous book. Sinclair has a nice style but works little with her dramatic lesbian story line. Sinclair continues the coming-of-age plot, and writes it well, but her story is the same old same old with merely half of the flavor of the first novel."
5,"I'm definitely gonna read her next novel, she's great","I ususally don't buy hardback books because they are more expensive, but let me just say, this was well worth the price. Sinclair is a great writer and she deserves coodos for this book. I loved it and it was well worth the time it took me to read it. She does veer from the subject matter at times, but she does a great job of saving the manuscript towards the end. GREAT READ, and I would love to see one of her books made into a movie."
1,"poorly written, no explanation, do not buy this book.",I felt this book was hastily and poorly written. The provided examples are solved in a haphazardly and crude manner with little or no explanation given. I don't recommend this book to anyone wanting to prepare for this portion of the exam.
3,"Sacrilege I know, but this book is fairly boring","I read this 15 book years ago, and didn't enjoy it very much. Since it is such a classic, I decided to buy it again and re-read it, thinking maybe I was too young the first time around. I must say, after two attempts, it was boring again. The book has a few interesting moments, chief among them the evening scene in Seamus' lair, but as a whole for such a short book, it is a chore to get through. I think better mental books about golf are definitely Extraordinary Golf or any of Rotella's books. Rotella is completely different, but as far as getting in touch with the mental game of golf, they are far superior. I'd say Extraordinary golf is closer to being an ethereal match with Golf in the Kingdom, but is infinitely more enjoyable."
2,Double bogey,My son who is an avid golfer convinved me to read this book.I just bogged down about one third through. It became achore to continue and life is too short when there are so many good reads left.
2,"A little too far ""out there""!","I made it through the first half of the book, which is a narrative of the golfing adventure of the author with Shivas Irons, a pro at the Burningbush golf course in Scotland. Even this part of the book is a fairly strange read, dealing with the ultimate meaning of life as it realtes to golf, but involving way too much mysticism.The second half, which is supposed to be the author's notes about the golfing philosophy of Shivas Irons, was just not readable to me. I just had way too many other books on my reading list to spend any more time trying to fight my way through this stuff!"
1,Prepared to be bored.,"What started out as an interesting idea for a book along the lines of ""The Greatest Game Ever Played"" deteriorated into psycho babble and a severe wasted of time. If you have to buy it, don't buy it new ..."
1,Stereotypes and weak continuity,"This book is absolutely a waste of time and money. Is there one character who is not taken directly from the realm of stereotype? We think not. Looking for a good book to read, try ""the Long Walk,"" or ""The Island of Dr. Moreau,"" or ""The Book of Tao"": there are many excellent books written by excellent writers - this high-school level offering is without value."
2,Golfers Beware,"If you are a golfer, ignore this. It's probably a good read for ageing hippies into 60s/70s mysticism. Golf provides a backdrop but is not the main thesis. If you are looking for any insight into golf psychology look elsewhere 'cos it aint here."
1,Horrible simple-minded stereotyping,"I wonder how a book that exploits age-old simple-minded stereotypes of men and women fails to draw criticism. This simplistic offering deserves zero stars in that it ties in to nothing of the game of golf, nothing of the nature of humanity, and nothing of interest. Zero stars and the JACKASS award for a total and complete lack of sensitivity. Ann"
4,Best golf lesson I've had,"This book substantially changed the way I play golf. For starters, I've managed to stop abusing my equipment. And I'm less prone to overswinging. Most of all, I enjoy playing more. A great life lesson."
2,"The first half of the book rocks, then it's a triple bogey.","Like another review said, the first half of the book is excellent and classic. However, the 2nd part of the book get's disjointed and I found it quite frankly very boring. So enjoy the first part with Shivas and Seamus and skim the rest.peace out."
2,Too Deep For Me,"I may not be very bright, but this book was way over my head. I listened to it on audio cassette and had to force myself to finish it. I would recommend Miracle on the 17th Green and Missing Links before this book."
2,Seemed like it tried too hard,"I feel like I could read just about anything revolving around golf and I had heard a lot of good things about this book, so I entered with an open mind and just could not like it. There wer parts that I enjoyed, but it is important to be interested in the unusual things to enjoy this. If you are a fan of science fiction, or The Lord of the Rings or something a little off-beat spiritually, and you also like golf - then this may indeed be a very good book for you. In my opinion, the book tries too hard to put a serious discussion of the universal greatness of golf wrapped in a somewhat silly wrapper."
3,Good for some,"This book is not for everyone. It will make you look at golf in a different way, but not everyone will care all that much. If you are into looking for deeper meaning in the things you do, this is the book you are looking for."
2,Not a Golf Book!,"I had heard about this near-mythical book on the philosophy of golf and had high expectations. The book started out well enough, as the author recounted his one and only round with Shivas Irons. From there it digressed into philosophical fiddle-faddle with very little golf attached to it. The last few sections are disconnected meanderings that may or may not mention golf at all. This is an abstruse philosophy book with a golf veneer. Read a friend's copy, but do not buy this book. Go play a round instead."
1,silly,"This is a silly, pretentious book about a silly, pretentious game. In fact, this is possible the silliest book that I've ever read."
4,Well organized. A great beginners guide!,"This is a wonderful introduction to Wicca for teens. It focuses less on ""casting spells"" and more on the spirituality of Wicca. It also places a lot of emphasis on personal responsibility and the ethics of the Wiccan religion.The bulk of the book teaches the elements and the correspondences of each. It is written in a very organized, easy to follow and ""down to earth"" way. As a facilitator of a Wiccan youth group, I refer to it constantly."
5,The Best,This book is one of the best for teens wanting too learn more about what Witchcraft relly is
4,Excellet Quality for a Low Price,"I have been using this camera for about a month and a half and have not yet been disappointed. I only gave it 4 stars because I have not yet had any film developed so don't know the quality. The camera itself has many different zoom options as well as serveral selections to imporve film quality (i.e. red eye reduction, taking picures outside, taking pictures inside, etc.) An excellent camera for a good price."
2,You get what you pay for.,"It is not bad, but not great.There were a couple of pages in the first prints with dots on them.After a month or two of medium use it started to not print certain areas of the page.After a couple heavy shakes it is back to printing correctly.I don't have faith that this will last anywhere near as long as its offical conterpart."
1,Empty in 15 pages,I guess a $17 version of a $90 part is too good to be true. This high-capacity toner cartridge arrived virtually empty of toner. It ceased putting toner on paper after only a few sheets were printed. I believe this company ripped me off.
5,Good quality with nice shipment,"C7115X cartridge works well in HP1200, same quality print as previous toners bought locally from ""Cartidge World"" that were twice the price.Shipment included helpfull notes, nice touch."
2,The bad book binding,The book itself is excellent. The only problem is that from the first time of flipping through the large book the binding started to come un-done. A few days later the binding came completely undone and I now have to return it.
1,"You get what you pay for, I guess",The battery door broke the first time we attempted to use the thing... sent it back for a refund. Seems cheaply constructed.
4,Interesting look at an interesting man.,"I don't always agree with what Mr. Buckley has to say; our political tendencies, while not diametrically opposed, are certainly not aligned to any great degree. But he is always interesting, and always well-spoken and erudite. If one wants a look at the thinking behind the Conservative movement, there may be no better place to look than right here."
3,"Didn't work well, but might have been user problem.","This piece is plastic and the blades aren't sharp at all. I tried making the kaiser marks on rolls after they had risen, and about all it did is deflate the rolls so they came out pretty flat. I will try it next time before the last raise and see if it works better."
5,Hidden advantage,"I ""shopped"" this item and none of the stamps I studied included a feature I wanted in their product description. I wanted some type of depth gauge to prevent me from cutting too deeply into the dough....My first attempt at Kaiser Rolls went well but I used my dough blade and cut too deeply, which gave me something that was more like monkey bread, oops. While the description for this product does not say it, this stamp actually has an automatic depth gauge. You can not go wrong. I love it."
5,Makes your rolls look like they came from a bakery!,"This stamp is fantastic...if you're having issues with the impression, roll your dough into a small ball and then press the stamp (not all the way through) to flatten and make the kaiser impression...then turn them over to rise top side down (yes, it helps them retain their shape). After they've doubled in size or when the size is what you'd like, before baking, flip them back over and bake away! Works great!"
3,"Works as expected, but breaks easily.","I purchased this a while ago and it worked well, until I dropped it and broke of the handle. I would not purchase this again or any plastic one for that matter because of this. I did, however, glue the handle back on and have continued using it for about 2 months making 2 dozen kaisers every week. If you don't mind gluing the handle back on with food grade glue, go ahead and purchase."
5,The Courage Muscle Monique Doyle-Spencer,Monique Doyle-Spencer is an excellent writer. The Courage Muscle touches on comedy and seriousness.Recommend this for EVERYONE.
1,Legitimate product???,"I bought President Ginseng recently from Amazon. When I received it, I couldn't find the UPC symbol at all on the product. Also, there is no name or address printed on the product for manufacturer and/or distributor. I am seriously questioning whether this is a legitimate product."
4,evita :truth or dare,"this book not only shows evita life""s but also the life in argentine during her life, make us understant de quality and the customs of the argentinians society.Clearly it tries to put us in that time, and shows that her participation in the social,economical and political situation, considering that Evita was born in very low class, became to have so important role in the argentinian government, maybe more important that president Peron. She was loved by ones and hated by others, but she make her own history. It is a book that deserve to be readed not only as part of the history but also in order to see how is possible to have stron influence in the society coming from any social class."
3,Not cushy enough for me,"I admit I have tender feet. These cushions are hardly noticeable to me. They do help prevent my feet from sliding forward in peep-toe shoes, though, I'll say that for them. But I like more cushioning."
4,Salvaged some expensive shoes!,I bought a pair of shoes that became very uncomfortable after the 2nd or 3rd wear. I was about to give up on them but these pads totally eliminated the problem. I will definitely be buying these again as I tend to have issues with heels rubbing.
4,It's a mix of some very boring parts and some very interesting parts,"The book is a study in how two parties can cooperate without direct agreement using the opposing armies of World War I. For example, two armies might develop a convention of not attacking during breakfast. I found the parts that consider these spontaneous mechanisms fascinating. There are other parts that I found pretty boring but the good parts make the book well worth reading if you are interested in the topic of cooperation."
2,Disappointing,"Very disappointing as a gift to my nephews for Christmas. The cd player didn't work. Also I was under the impression that as a recorder, there would be a build-in microphone, but this item doesn't record outside of the tape to CD option. The Radio did work. In fairness, a careful read of description and questioning the functions is needed. I had to return this item for refund."
2,Coby,"We found the CD player sounds fine, not great just fine, but the radio sounds even worse. This would be a good first radio for a young child. Or if you wanted a radio that needed to be kept in a not so desireable location, in other words you wouldn't feel bad if it got ruined."
5,"very interesting, ecclectic, soulfull,","Burgo has a very rich,inviting voice. her material is different than anything i've heard in a long time. It's very refreshing...I'de love to hear more..."
4,Want to know more about nature? read this!,"The topic of this book is basically why I'm interested in science. Having studied the physics and math related to the phenomena described in the book for quite a while, I must say that this book is a 'must' for anybody who wants to know more about nature. Never mind that on a few occasions some inaccuracies occur; this is a book that will make you wonder, and not many books can say that. The only niggle is that a book this good should not have been written in the overly-casual 'I' form; this is not a narrative, but a great scientific book. The style of writing should reflect that."
5,"A challenge, but not impossible.","This game forces you outside the box when dealing with opponents. And they get a bit smarter every level. Sure it may be T & E, but learning from that readies you for what comes in the next level. Loved and hated the challenge of it for every minute."
4,strong jam from R,"this is one of R.Kelly's strong uplifting cuts about overcoming obstacles and doing better. He had Nas rapping on the track and it worked really well,but it was all about R.Kelly and His phrasing and pin point story telling that made this song really jump off. this cut is still a Banger and it has a cool groove."
3,Festus Saves the Day,"Long time fans of ""Gunsmoke"" or ""Marshall Dillon"" television shows will want to pass this book up. The characters brought from the small screen are rarely reminiscent of the long-playing show. The story itself has its ups and downs. The characters seem flat and unresponsive--all of them, that is, except for Festus. The one character that seems true to the program of the fifties and sixties is the grungy side-kick of Marshall Dillon. The fascination that causes the reader to stick with the book is the hidden intelligence and machismo of Festus Haggen. Western readers will enjoy this first installment if only to see Festus win the day more than once. McCarthy is also to be applauded for his working without overt sex scenes or extra foul language that publishers have convinced western writers is necessary. The book could possibly be a script that would make it past the censors of yesterday's TV."
3,"""Not Dick's best, or worst.""","This dizzy book never really takes off, like classic Dick; it reminds me of the stories I used to dream up as a small child: adventure after adventure after adventure, stock cardboard characters, without any overriding plan or scope, and with no set course except the enjoyment of spinning tales. Hey, the man couldn't create ""Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?"" every time out, could he"
4,"Excellent page turner, but a book of despair","Maze presents the common PKD theme of one ersatz reality, the one in which we believe we live, giving way to another. Invariably this is traumatic, such as in Ubik. In this case, however, all hope is lost as to a solution. Dick's metaphor of the doomed spaceship (being Earth) is gloomy indeed, and it is no surprise that this book was written at a time in Phil's life where he had no hope. The only hope is the mystical removal of Morley at the end, but this could be interpreted as an escape into death. This is not a happy novel.Nevertheless, as others have said, Maze is possibly the fastest PKD read you will encounter. I have read this book but once, and I was astounded at the time. I rate this extremely highly as a work of fiction, although I suspect that further reading will confirm what others have said - that is that the soul is not there, Dick no longer believes in what he is writing."
5,My first and favorite PKD book.,"This was the first PKD book I read, and it still remains my favorite, even above such incredible contenders as 3 Stigmata and Ubik. It is his most cohesive piece of work, and the ending, which may at first seem like a cop-out, in retrospect is actually an ingenious twist on an old gimmick - without giving it away, endings with this gimmick usually are ""uplifting"" and give you a ""whew!"" feeling. In A Maze of Death, however, it propels you into a place that is even worse than the previous ""place."" An updated ""...And Then There Were None (ten little indians)"" (by Agatha Christie)."
4,Pretty good book,"I couldn't put the book down once I started reading it, but when I finished, I was sorely disappointed. I wish he hadn't made it so traditional. It seemed like more of a way to end some wacky TV sit-com.Oh well."
4,A Maze-ing,"This is the first Phillip K. Dick book I have read, and based upon the experience, I intend to seek out others. This is possibly the most unique science fiction I've ever come across. It is impossible to say much about the book's ""alternate reality"" theme without giving away too much of the plot. In fact, before the plot began to turn, I wasn't sure I was enjoying it. Once it did, I was amazed because I had absolutely no idea where Dick was headed. Dick may not exactly be a household name among science fiction writers, but he has found himself a covert. My only regret is that I wish I had discovered him while he was still among the living."
4,Good not his best bet darned good,"Most of the other reviewers have mentioned everything I have to say. So the only comment I going to make is that everyone including the synopsis seems to have overlooked one of the central themes of the books. Imagine a place where you knew God existed and that he loved you. I don't mean a place where people have intense faith but somewhere where there is incontrivertible proof that God is real, if you ask him for help there is a good chane he will answer. Now imagine that suddenly your trapped on an isolated world, with a murder and God is nowhere to be found. In addition to that primary theme the book features a lot of good twists and turns, including the now sadly some what cliched ending. However no matter you have to give Dick credit for taking the above situation and then shocking you with an ending that turns that to far more hopeless."
5,Great Science Fiction,"Woody Allen is an artist whose work is based in part around philosophical musings. It's part of what makes him great. Those of us not partial to sitting around discussing the transient nature of love or the temperament of nature/God are enriched by his movies.Philip Dick is another such artist. This book is classic science-fiction, full of imaginative creations and dramatic twists and turns. It is a real ""page turner"". And underneath are musings on human existence and the nature of God. It's a great book. It's not his most likable one, but it's a real achievement."
1,Not Worth It,This software won't install on my Windows 7 Machine.It also doesn't come in a (Jewel case).I'd send it back but the cost of the postage outweighs that satisfaction.
3,ok,this did come fast and was in good shape but was disappointed in the way they shipped it but it was undamaged so i am happy about that
1,DON'T BUY,THIS IS A BAD PROGRAM. NEVER WORKED CORRECTLY AND MESSED UP MY REGISTER THAT i HAVE TO GET AN IT TO REPAIR. MY SHREDDER WORKED FINE ON THE DVD.
5,Virtual Pool 3,"Excellent! IF only I could ""plug-in"" my avatar Babe, to teach me how to avoid ""The Allure Gambit"" (aka:Sex appeal or Flasher to win ploy)"
3,interesting game,This game did not have all the features that I was looking for nor is it quite easy enough to learn to play but it is very interesting and with enough time I'm sure it will help my game.
5,Wonderful Experience,"This live concert is an Olympia masterpiece , the music, the introduction, it is a theme performance where every song has it's sense of place and time , from andalusian spanish style, passing through romantic france and vulgar meditarenian till enchanted dancing arabic music ... theatrical performance that must be experienced !"
5,Great book,Helps to explain what a derivative and denominator is in terms that you and your children can understand. More than just the number on the bottom of a fraction.
3,nothing exceptional,"i got this because i'm not very good at math and as my kids have progressed into junior and high school, i no longer understood what they were doing and am unable to help with their homework. i've tried to find a book that would take you step by step thru math problems. this book has helped some, but i can't find a book that clearly takes you thru the steps. also, it would be nice to have written rules, such as a clear and short explanation of how to do negative and positive numbers when multiplying, subtracting, etc."
1,Piece of Junk!!,"Product is very different than what was shipped.Keyboard was DOA and very ""cheaply"" made.Description was not what was shipped.Time and money to ship back was not worth it, so I guess I'll just have to ""eat it"" and chalk it up to you get what you pay for."
3,pleasant,"Fatal Attraction is a re-telling of the story of Aphrodite, and Troy, and Eros and.... Very much like its predecessor,Love Underground: Persephone's Tale: (The Goddesses #1) (The Goddessess Persephone's Tale).I enjoy the retelling of the myths, giving the gods & goddesses personalities, but there's no focus at all to this story. It just rambles on, goes off on tangents... and then stops.It's like driving around looking at fall leaves. It's a pleasant enough trip, but you don't get anywhere."
5,Growing up is hard to do..,"The book spanned a lot of time, which I think was necessary to really show the full spectrum of Aphrodite. She really didn't find true love herself until much later in life, although she went looking enough for it. I enjoyed the book, but did a lot of crying... growing up is hard to do, even for the Goddess of Love."
1,Not what they're cranked up to be.,These offer lower light output than the usual incandescent floodlight with similar wattage. Noticeably dimmer in comparison to my older ones. Seller is not at all willing to take responsibility for this and is refusing to pay return postage. I think this is misleading description of the product.
1,Dim!,"Fully agree with other reviewers. This 100W bulb gives less light output than a regular 65W bulb -- because it is rated for 130 volts, not 110 or 120. The websites (more than this one) selling this bulb do NOT make you aware of this fact."
4,The original dialect,"The beauty and splendor of Harris' work was and is its faithful representation of a culture and language of a time and place unique in USA history. ""The Complete Tales of Uncle Remus"" continues that effort."
5,The Complete Tales of Uncle Remus,A family tradition for our family. Great to have it to read to our grandchildren. Many well know stories included.
1,language warning,"The language in this book is in the vernacular of the deep south in the early 1800's. It might as well have been in old english. I couldn't follow the stories & I knew what they were! I had been hoping to share this with my grandchildren, but sent it back instead."
3,A little hard to read,"Not sure who they wrote this for. Childish for adults, difficult writing style for kids. Something more conventional would be better."
3,Complete tales completely unable to read,"Nice book and good memories of the stories. I couldn't read it to my son in any way that made sense to either of us since it's written as Uncle Remus would speak and I thought I'd be able to get the lingo for an authentic reading experience, but it ended up as mostly gibberish that I'm hoping grandpa might have better luck with the translation. Probably very entertaining if read correctly, but I couldn't do it so will be looking for a more neutral or ""vanilla"" rendition."
3,The Complete Tales of Uncle Remus - 1955 Edition,"Fair price & shipping costs. Product was very dirty, but after all, it was a library book over 50 years old!"
2,paid for nothing,This CD was a gift and it did not work. I can't get it back to return it....very disappointed.
1,Not what I expected at all - very hard to read!,"While I can appreciate the author's attept to preserve the colloquial expressions of the era, and most especially of the ""Negro Speech"" of the time, this has rendered the entire book to be virtually unreadable. It is not unlike attempting to read ""Olde Englishe"", except with fewer dialect rules. I found it to be very difficult to the point where the whole book was was pretty useless. If you are looking for readable Folk Tales, I would suggest going to ""Best Loved Folktales of the World"" by Joanna Cole. This Uncle Remus work was, sadly, a *huge* disappointment for me."
3,Great for adults,"I had gotten this book to read to a classroom of elementary children. It was not what I had expected. I had hoped for larger and more pictures that the children could enjoy and for the language of the stories to have been adapted. I was looking for something more in the line with ""Song of the South.:"
1,Racism Packaged for Kids,"It is astounding to me that no on has mentioned the overt racism depicted in this book. When Harris wrote this, he basically just wrote down African American oral folklore and repurposed it for a white audience, exaggerating the slave dialect, and most horribly of all, depicted the stereotypical ""happy slave."" Anyone with any cultural sense should raise an eyebrow when reading this, and any kid reading it should be made to understand that this is not a accurate depiction of African Americans.People can say this review is unhelpful all they want, but it doesn't make the above any less true."
5,Great book,I'd lost the copy of The Tales of Uncle Remus that I'd had for 25+ yr. It was a great surprise to find it on Amazon and be able to get back in my home again. Brand new and ready to read.
4,Pretty good,"As there are zero reviews, here's my quick .02Said sling arrived as described. Quality is on-par with (my) expectations and well worth $20. If the description matches what you're looking for, I see no reason to hesitate ordering."
4,A light little work with an ironic title ...,"The book is 140 pages an is in lagre tyye double spaced. So, if you are blind than this is the erotic bok for you ...Its a simple sensous tale done in two parts. 19th century France finds our young heroine playing the voyeur spying on her young aunt and husband enjoying their bodies hidden away in the bushes and summer houses. Although her fingers give her much wanted relief she is finally wedded to a rather rich fopish gentleman who comes from the 'slam bam thank you mam' school ...The second part of the book then deals with the utterly French custom of young ladies of leisure finding relief to their burning need in the arms of a young lieutenant ....Nothing kinky here just sweet and soft eroticism which may the perfect book for someone who may be reading Harlequin and wants more punch in the sex parts of the book....."
4,Pretty good action figure.,"This is a pretty good action figure. The figure looks like Boss Nass alright. He comes with some okay accessories. A staff and the comtech chip. The only thing I am not crazy about is his robe-a is quite odd and stiff-yeah, I know it's plastic-but isn't it supposed to look like leather, or clothe?.Okay for the collector who's going to use the figure for display, in or out of the box. Most of the other Star Wars figures are a bit better. Still, I give this guy 4 stars."
4,"Motivating, Powerful","Richard Flint is NOT larry or even close. He's a straight from the hip, been-there-done-that, get it together kinda guy. I found a couple of old VHS tapes in a basement of funeral home he made and, after watching them, wondering what kind of know-it-all sod put them down there. He's an easy read and will put back any steam you might have lost along the life's perilous journey. I consider it a modern day Napoleon Hill wihtout all the glamour of like a Tony Robbins. Nice, short stuff you can read, put it down and feel better after."
4,Great Paints,"My toddler loves to paint in the tub/shower. It's hard for her to get the paint out by herself, which means she can't pour all of the paint out at once."
1,Beware!!!,"I did not get the whole kit, my review is for the crayons. They are horrible!!!! Great idea and my kids liked it but my tub took about ten minutes of scrubbing with a scrubber sponge to get the crayon off and my daughters hands are stained pink now!! She likes to write on the walls and then rub her hands over it which she should be able to do and not come away looking like a grape!! These things are going in the trash. Maybe the paints would be better, but I don't think I will trying anytime soon."
5,Clark is my Hero...now,I always wandered what really goes on behind the scenes - when two or more important head State figures talk.I was wandering about so many other things relating to the 1999 war in my country Kosova - and thanks to the General Clark's crystal clear writing I have learned them all.You'd just love this book - It tells us all WHAT A COURAGEOUS PERSON LIKE mr.WESLEY CLARK can really achieve...not less thandefeating one whole state and so many government policies JUST TO BRING PEACE AND LOVE TO THE CIVILIZED WORLD.NO (COUNTRY)ONE IS ABOVE LAW OR BEYOND THE REACH OF THE JUSTICE thanks to people like Wesley Clark.
1,Waging the same old barbarism,"Waging Modern War is instructive in only one regard. It affords us direct insight into the Dr. Strangelove world of ego tripping generals with Ozymandias type titles like Supreme Commander. It serves up Orwellian excuses for imperial intervention and the systematic bombing of civilian targets under the guise of humanitarian intervention. Waging Modern War is ultimately only an updated version of the same old doctrines of military callousness and the dehumanizing language which refers to slain civilians as ""collateral damage.""Tacitus would have had the perfect rejoinder to this exercise in military egomania: ""They make a desert and call it peace."""
2,words of a war criminal,"Clark ordered the use of cluster bombs over civilian areas, used depleted uranium bombs and presided over the terror bombing of cities (bridges, electrical grids, power stations, TV stations, hospitals, etc.). Most people would call him a war criminal. For him to write a book about it is disgusting."
1,Diary of an Insane War Criminal.,"A friend of mine remarked that Gen Clark was a certifiable monster, I disagree. He's a certified monster and this book serves as the certificate. In this book, Clark extols the virtues of unrestricted warfare, strategic carpet bombing and the absolute, undivided power of military brassdom. In a very biased manner, he blasts NATO for not giving him full license to commit wanton slaughter. This book largely serves as an apology for his murderous strategy. A strategy so morally repugnant that the Russians had to intervene to stop it. Even then Clark tried to start an armed conflict with Russia when he ordered an airborne assault on the the airport in Pristina. Thank God his orders were refused by General Sir Jackson. Clark is a raving lunatic."
2,Meh,"Bought this book for a project I was doing on modern warfare and it's a very tough read. At times, I found myself bored or looking for something else to do, like walk a dog I don't even have."
5,MUST READ for all officers,"I'll make this short and to the point. If you are an officer in the US Army, or any branch of the armed services, you need to read this book. GEN Clark meticulously details the events surrounding the entire NATO operation in Kosovo and gives great insight into what really goes on ""echelons above God."" It certainly gives me a new perspective on the military planning process and how/why we accomplish what we do. You know what happened during the campaign, now find out why and what each key player was thinking."
5,Slow read,"General Clark has provided valuable insight into conducting modern war. His book deals almost exclusively with the political ramifications of the Kosovo War. He educates the reader into the efforts regquired to communicate with his US military superiors - the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the SecDef, NSC leadership, the president, and others. But that is only half the effort. The second requires communicating continually with NATO leadership plus the military and political leadership of NATO member countries. It is an incredible story.I read the book to get a better understanding of what happened in the Kosovo War. It provides one insider perspective. Will read other books to get other views."
1,Oops,"This card arrived today with drivers that are incompatible with Vista, despite this product's April 2006 release date. Same story at the Promise website, which seems to be crashing sort of constantly."
1,Aging rockers,"I wanted to see the stones in concert as I have been a fan since the 60s. I should have known better expecting Mick to sing like he did so many decades ago. When I view the concert I get the feeling that they are ""just doing a job"" and they are tired and bored with the whole thing. Mick gets tired running around the huge stage and can't seem to sing some the the words without straining. I guess this is the best I can expect out of ""aging rockers."""
3,False Advertising,"The sounds great, the energy is pure, but what I find disturbing is that they don't play any songs off the Voodoo Lounge Album. Whats the sense of touring and making a concert video of an album that your not going to play live."
1,Crap,"This concert sucks!! Horrible sound, boring performance and boring songs. The Stones used to be a great rock'n'roll band but this just show how much they have lost. It all ends with long and booring version of 'Satisfaction'. Who really need to that song played by grandpa?"
2,Stones bring Voodoo magic back to touring,"Those of you who were at the Thanksgiving concert will know that this concert went for a LOT longer than 95 minutes, and what a killer set list it was !!Where as the Bridges to Babylon concert was left uncut, this Voodoo Lounge performance is pretty much butchered. Great songs like ""Monkey Man"",""Beast Of Burden"",""Before they Make Me Run"",""Live With Me"" (guest vocals: Sheryl Crow !) and quite a few others deserved to be kept for this release.Hopefully the awesome HBO Madison Suare Gardens concert in January 2003(40 Licks tour) will be released uncut like the Babylon DVD.Still, what remains is a good looking concert, and shows the Stones proving they can keep up the pace post-Steel Wheels. This DVD would've gotten a higher rating if the full concert had been included with 5.1 surround sound though."
4,Like the concert ...but!,"I attended the Vodoo Lounge tour at the Oakland Colliseum and it was one of the best I've ever seen. The DVD captures the same excitement. How can you not enjoy the stage...amazing. Except for the fact that the DVD does not show the large puppets of Janis Joplin, Elvis Presley and others that bobbed up and down as the stage rocked. I don't own any other Stone's DVD's and I don't think I need too, this one makes you want to drink beers and party. Buy it."
3,Go get Bridges,"The Bridges to Babylon DVD is MUCH better, but this DVD is good as well. I guess I was just spoiled because I got the Bridges one first/"
1,Quality of 3mm tape poor!,"I cleaned the surface of my taillights before applying the covers, with in over a week the light covers started to come undone, so i had to go out and purchase glue just to keep the covers on! For what these cost I was not amused, also just to add when i applied these the temperature was around 65 degrees out and as I said I cleaned the light thoroughly. Very disappointed to say the least!"
1,too salty,"This product is way too salty. I didn't like it at all, and neither did any of my family. you can't get the taste out your mouth either after tasting one."
3,This product is fine for the job,"There's not a lot written about these products, and I had to search a little bit to be sure these blades would fit my car. I have a 2011 Chevrolet Equinox and this fits my rear window. I wish the product had come with instructions for replacement, it was a big mystery to me."
4,They work in Chicago weather,"These aren't the most comfortable things for dogs I'm sure but I love that they have a reflective strip on them and they velcro on so I can adjust how tight they are. In the Chicago winters, my dog has a hard time walking more than a block or two between the cold snow and the salt. I put these on her and she walked two miles like it was no problem! She walked through ice puddles and on top of uneven snowy surfaces and she seemed fine."
3,Wish they were sturdier,"After about 10 miles of walking on snow-covered pavement, the vinyl tops and leather bottoms are wearing through. They certainly do the job I bought them for (keeping snow from accumulating and turning into ice chunks between my dogs pads), but materials a little more durable would be welcome."
4,Pretty good,"I bought 2 different sets of dog boots. This one and the rugged dog boots. These are easy compared to most to put on and take off. There doesn't seem to be too much insulation, but for me, it does the job. My dogs aren't out for too long so these fit my purpose. If my dogs were out for an hour or more, I would go for the rugged dog boots."
2,"NOT ""ALL WEATHER BOOT""","Positive: I got the package quicker than I'd expected. The designed looks really nice. It fits right for my dogs.Negative: The Product said ""all weather boot"" NOT TRUE! first day I put these boots on my labs, it was soaked through their paws. few days of wearing them, It was tearing already. When I saw the price, I thought it was a steal. the saying, you get for what you pay for is true. If you want a real ""all weather boot"" and looking for durability, DONOT BUY THIS ONE. spend little more for better quality. Although, this boot will be fine if its not raining or snowing."
2,Not really extreme all weather,"I bought these when I moved to NYC with my little southern dog. They go on fine, but I don't like how much velcro is left after getting them on the dog. Also, they don't keep his feet warm at all. He has to walk through snow to get to his little potty area, and the cold and wet go right through the leather on the bottom. I'm going to try Woof Hoofs next."
3,I give it 3 stars for the price,"You get what you pay for and dont expect too much with these boots. My dog wore them once and that was no fun for him. They would not stay on his feet properly unless we overtightend the velcro straps. I replaced these with a set of Ruffwear griptrex boots, at $50 they are a much better buy because they fit properly and have a real protective sole. My dog loves his Ruffwear boots. I would not recommend these boots"
4,Use Psychology Agressively to be a winner,"This is really a book on Chess Psychology but not necessarily taking a scientific approach. One thing for sure, this book is fun to read. However, I would take some of the advice with a ""grain of salt"". For example, ""Play the person not the board"" is the exact opposite suggestion giving in my other book (more on training, but has a great chapter on practical chess psychology for the tournament player), ""Winning Chess Tournaments for Juniors"" that suggests you mostly focus on finding the best moves, but the a secondary degree you must keep in mind who your opponent is and give yourself some practical chances. But as mentioned ""Chess for Tigers"" is enjoyable and fun - but be careful not to take everyting suggested as ""gospel""."
5,Superb!,"Rostropovich and Guilini collaborated seemlessly in both concerti. However, the microphone picked up Cellist's breathing a few times. Yet, it's still a must-have for cello fans."
4,"Magnificent performances, not well directed","I agree that Hugo Kach did a less than stellar job of capturing this great performance. It was taped, by the way, not filmed. Kach did a somewhat better job on the filmed performance of Rostropovich playing and conducting the Haydn concerti. That said, the sound is dynamic, the video is adequate, and the combo of Rostropovich and Giulini is amazing. This is, I believe, the finest of Rostropovich's several recordings of the Dvorak, and has the magnificent tone, phrasing, and nobility this greatest of cello concerti requires. So, ten plus for performance and sound, and quite a bit less for video direction."
3,Incredible voice - Okay production,"I've only listened to the CD once so I may feel better if I listen again but the first listen didn't grab me. Don't get me wrong, Alanis' voice is incredible and her lyrics are still original and interesting. I'm a production person though and for me, unlike some of her previous work, this CD doesn't break any new ground musically. On Supposed Former.... as well other CDs of hers, the tracks grabbed me before I even heard her voice or the subject. For this CD, the voice and subject matter have to do the job by themself."
3,Deja Vu,"I am an honest fan an have to agree with some of the other reviews that Alanis' latest release is simply deja vu. I find myself subconciously trying to pick out what parts of each song were lifted from her past albums. I did not have that experience with any of her other studio albums. Song for song, ""Junkie"" is my favorite Alanis album because so many of the songs have their own feel and structure. The lyrics are deep and meaningful. I liked every song on ""Under Rug Swept"" too and found unexpected twists and turns throughout it dispite what other reviewers have had to say. But on ""Chaos"" it's just not there. I've listened to the cd three times and ""Knees of My Bees"" is the only song I can actually recall. I hope her next album explores a new king of music/genre. She has a great voice and should take some risks. This album sounds like she is trying to please radio programmers and radio sucks."
2,Alanis Had Done Better Works Before!,"I will give two stars for her effort, but this work is not great like the ones before. Her new CD seems going immature and the ones before seems to be more in the mature side. What is the matter Alanis? Go back to your good sense and great poetry."
4,Great Album !,"I find a good Album with good songs, but not so good to arrive wings 5 stars, the song that she opens the album ""Eight Easy Steps"" I find Excellent because she reminds me to the Alanis of ""Jagged Little Pill"" very to the style Rock, Apologize she Also appears an excellent song. I also Love Everything although it is not the best in her neither of the Albúm for that reason give to the Album a 4/5"
4,Whole new Alanis(not that she wasn't talented before),This Cd sums up all of her feelings from the past years I think almost everyone i know can relate to atleast one song on this cd if not more. she is such a talented and intellectual person if you listen to the entire cd you can or atleast open up to what life actually means. the songs are very catchy and the lyrics are beyond ingenious as usual
2,So Called Chaos just not the Alanis I was hoping for...,"I've played the heck out of Alanis' former CDs. This new one just doesn't have the same appeal. Alanis is happy in her personal life, and I'm happy for her, but her music was better when she was tortured."
5,So-Called Alanis,"With her first studio album in two years, singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette returns with complexity, a new found sense of peace, and a subdued ferocity with ""So-Called Chaos."" SCC is an amalgamation of all of Alanis' previous discs with ""Spineless"" and ""Everything"" belonging to ""Jagged Little Pill,"" ""So-Called Chaos"" and ""This Grudge"" tagging along with ""Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie"" and ""Doth I Protest Too Much"" and ""Excuses"" fitting in well with ""Under Rug Swept."" ""So-Called Chaos,"" while a short cd, is also one of her best and should be given the credit it deserves. I gauge an album by how many songs I skip and there is only one that has ""skippage"" potential and that is ""Not All Me.""Alanis is back, and better than ever. Some say the album is missing in the blindly fueld rage that shot Alanis to stardom back in 1995. But if they would only stop and disect her songs a little, they would see that the same Alanis is still there--only now we have more layers to love."
3,Pretty decent,"This is a decent album. You can give my review a NO on whether you found it helpful but I can't in good conscience give it 4 stars and that's for three reasons:1) Excuses sounds WAY too much like her earlier song ""precious illusions"". It's not the sound but the chorus is pretty much echoing the same thing.2) One of the songs harps on about being a weak willed yes-man woman and I found its feminist overtones simply puerile.3) Most importantly, she has two songs that use the word ""assuage"". This is not a common word in music and in fact I've not heard it in a song before. Nonetheless, she manages to fit it into two songs on the same album. As proud as I am of Alanis for picking up a dictionary I have to give a thumbs down on that pretentiousness.Those issues aside it's a good album, though :)"
2,I'm disappointed......,"I'm a big Alanis fan, believe me. It's just that this record is so sub-par. The whole stream-of-consciousness thing is nice, but now it's taken over and makes the songs totally unmusical. They've completely lost any good lyric quality; it's like reading from a psychologist's notes on a narcissistic manic-depressive patient - in a bad way. She could've made up for it, though, with good, unique melodies and such, but all the melodies are so plain and boring and predictable and poppish that even the great production work on this record can't save them. ""Spineless"" is a pretty good song, but ""Everything"", the first single, just sounds like every other song by washed-up 90's bands trying to sound cool on the radio. It's so embarrassingly typical of modern rock-pop. I really do love Alanis, but this has definitely got to be her worst work."
2,Not the Right Direction for Her,"I loved JLP, SIFJ and Unplugged. I think she stepped down a notch with URS but SCC is another step down from that album even. The album flows from one song to the next without any real change in gears. One song isn't distinguishable from the next. With her amazing voice and clever lyrics I think she can come up with something better than this. Compare this album to a Sunday drive..comfortable yet all too familiar. Get back on the highway, Alanis!!"
3,Grows on You,"I'm a huge fan of Alanis Morissette and have all her CD's (less her dance albums before ""Jagged Little Pill"" and B-sides). ""So-Called Chaos"" took a while to grow on me - two years to be exact. Not an insult (like I said, I'm a huge fan of Alanis), but it took this long for me to discover the gems here.""Eight Easy Steps"", ""Excuses"", ""So-Called Chaos"" and ""Not All Me"" are all remarkable songs that only Alanis could create.A really unique artist who will hopefully blow the world away again with a long overdue ""comeback"" (I hate to use this word, that the music industry seems to stick on artists who never really ""go away"") album."
3,Follows in the footsteps of Under Rug Swept,"To me this just sounds like Under Rug Swept Part 2, eventhough I like Rug better. It's still a good CD. It seems Alanis kindof veered from her rock roots which put her on the map in 1995. I miss that sound. Don't get me wrong there are great songs on here but a lot of ""fillers"" it seems. Standout tracks are: So-Called Chaos, 8 Easy Steps, Out Is Through & Everything. I love Alanis's voice and her writing style. I would just love to hear her go back to the ""rockin'"" days of Jagged Little Pill and Supposed Former Infatuation Junky."
4,Great album!,"This is her 2nd best album from her behind ""Jagged Little Pill"" In my Opinion!The album has great song's and Alanis sounds great!"
2,Kinda Dated Sound,Nothing really special or that will make you're jaw drop. She seems to be stuck on that same style from her older stuff.
2,We've wated over 2 years for this??,"She's one of my top artists, but this CD could have been a lot better! I mean, after over 2 years since her last release, we get this 10 song CD? Most of the songs are low, mellow, and sound the same. There's not much variety here. This could have been a lot better!"
3,Borderline,"After her brilliant 2002 release ""Under Rug Swept"", I was hoping for a part 2 of Under Rug Swept. Well I some what got my wish. This album takes a few listens to get use to. ""Excuses"" reminds me way too much of ""Precious Illusions"". But it's still good. The stand out songs are ""Out Is Through"", ""So Called Chaos"", and ""Spineless"". The only song I don't care for at all is ""This Grudge"" the beginning is great, but the chorus ruins it and it's just unorganized. So that removes a star. And the other reason why I take away another star is because there are only 10 songs! 11 was just enough for Under Rug Swept. But I wanted the same amount of songs for So Called Chaos, or more. It just seems that artists like Alanis and Madonna are getting lazy when it comes to making new albums. We want at least 12 tracks! But this album isn't all that bad. I'm still a big Alanis fan. And I can't wait for the next record."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with this cd. I preferred her edgier stuff from Jagged Little Pill. This was a little sicky sweet akin to Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, which in my opinion just sucked. I prefer Alanis after she broke up with someone music to Alanis being happy and singing about how everything is wonderful. If you like Supposed....get this but if it annoyed you too, then pass."
5,A new chapter in Alanis' life and maybe your own too...,"This is a great ""I'm finally over you"" or maybe even an ""I'm almost over you"" CD to listen to! Emotionally, Alanis has come a long way from the JLP days - she finally has closure. Poignant lyrics, as always, and a good variety of different music styles. A serene pick me up for all heart broken souls!"
4,great album,much better than Under Rug Sweptthe only problem with the album is that it's too short!and i really don't agree with Everything as the first single. there are much better songs on the album!
2,Unoriginal,"This album was a disappointment. I don't think Alanis is capable of producing a bad album, yet they keep getting worse and worse. Jagged Little Pill, of course, was her best. SFIJ was her second best. But with Under Rug Swept, you see the beginnings of what has transpired on this record: as the years go by, her music keeps getting more and more over-produced, and her brilliant lyrics are underscored by cookie-cutter music she puts them to. This album just sounds too perfect. On almost every song, the chorus overlaps with the end of the verse, and we all know that would never happen if she were in concert. I just don't like how perfect and produced it sounds. It takes away from her voice and her lyrics."
5,So-called chaos,absolutely brilliant! i can't get enough of it. i highly recommend this record. i don't believe there is a single negative thing to say about it. it is both lyrically and musically engaging...simply amazing.
5,Grabbed me from the beginning,"I am not sure what everyone has against 8 Easy Steps, but I downloaded this alubm and started listening and was grabbed by it from the first chorus and repeated the song several times before even moving on to song 2. I love how her voice trails off right before the chorus kicks in. Great song, great album."
4,"More of the same - good or bad, you decide!","I liked Under Rug Swept, and so I was eager to see what This So-Called Chaos was all about. Alanis doesn't seem to have ventured very far with her sound - this could loosely be described as ""more of the same"" - some may be pleased to hear this, others not so happy. If anything it's a little less heavier.For me, this album is an improvement on Under Rug Swept. That album had a couple of good songs, the rest was disposable filler you could forget about as soon as you finished listening. So-Called Chaos ups the ante with what is generally an enjoyable listen.A lot of it is very accessible and there are some stellar tracks in the form of Eight Easy Steps (I can't stop listening to it), Out Is Through, Excuses, Doth I Protest Too Much, Knees Of My Bees and the current single, Everything. My only gripe is that the album starts off really strong then kind of slackens off a little, before ending on Everything.Overall a solid effort. Worth the purchase."
2,Too happy?,"This is the weakest Alanis album yet. If you have listened to the previous albums, each new song will leave you with the thought ""Hmmm, haven't I heard this one before?"". There is very little new to be found here, and it seems to lack drive and inspiration. If you don't have the other 3 albums, buy them first - especially Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, which is her absolute best. Maybe she has become too happy in her life to write the really excellent music?"
2,just aight,it wasn't that long ago that Alanis Morissette ditched the Paula Abdul early Musical offerings that she first came out with.but she has been Mellowing&Mellowing more over time&while that is cool in spots something about Her Musical presentation over the years keeps falling off.she seems at a Crossroads as a Artist&can't get out of the Rut she is on.she still gives you a Moment or two here&there but truth be told unless She truly changes Her Stylings up a bit then her albums will continue to go down as Boring.
2,The Death of Rock and Roll began with Alanis Morissette,"I saw Alanis Morissette on TV performing with her band during some concert someplace. At the time, I thought she was a joke, something not to be taken seriously.At this point I've come to the conclusion that Alanis Morissette is part of a marketing effort by record companies to categorize different target audiences. Alanis Morissette has absolutely no sex appeal. Therefore, her main appeal will be to young chicks. Very few guys will even care.To be honest, this isn't a terrible album. I gave it two stars, because anything's better than listening to that b*tch Vanessa Carlton."
1,Good Music for people who don't care about Music!,"This, like the rest of her crap, is boring garbage designed to hit whatever market might be hot at the moment. When Nirvana cracked the mainstream with some vicious riffs & basically started the big ""alternative"" scene, this neverwillbe got her wimped-out aldult contemporary inoffensive snooze-a-thon played on alternative/avant garde programs, and people actually went for it. All hype.You probably aren't up to listening to anything with any balls, or really any true feeling, anyway. That's why you're checking Alanis out. So buy this. It's so light and poppy! I would rather find something for a straight man to listen to.Last piece of advice-just read this review over and over, and save your money. It's much better art than the album."
1,"Put some clothes on, Alanis!",Alanis Morissette has shown none of the class Britney Spears has in her ten-year career. Alanis is constantly flaunting herself in front of the camera to make up for her lack of talent. Listen to Britney Spears instead!!!
1,More of the same nonsense from Alanis Morissette,"Alanis Morissette seems to be in denial of her 30th birthday on June 1. Morissette continues to write lame 8th-grade-style songs about past lovers while being backed by equally lame music. Morissette has failed to offer us anything refreshing since 1995's ""Jagged Little Pill"" masterpiece, which I think is proof Morissette has grown tired and boring after just one album."
1,If this is the number one CD...,it doesn't say much for the music industry these days. I listened to a song on Real Rhapsody and thank God I did. I wouldn't pay 2 cents for this garbage. UCK!
3,"average,not long enough","Well, you`d think having just bombed with her previous release 'under rug swept', she would at least offer value for her next effort. I don`t call 10 tracks value.I personally find her self -professing lyrics and ludicrous album titles grating. Had 'supposed informer fatuation junkie ' ( another ridiculous album title ) been her first release, I doubt we would ever have heard of her again, as it itself was far from a commercial success. While this album is far from offensive, and does possess the odd good tune in the title track ' so called chaos' and also 'excuses', you could still only call it an average album. If you can deal with her annoying lyrics and nasally voice then go for it. For die hard fans only."
1,What happened to Alanis?,"Unfortunately, with Alanis, she was exposed to TOO MUCH success from the beginning, and has failed to live up to the reputation ever since. ""So Called Chaos"" is a collection of dull, boring, poetic based songs, that Alanis has sung about far too many times before. It's like she's recycling old lyrics to new music. The music is dull, no feel to it, and Alanis, while her voice still sounds good, just fails miserably at making it work this time around. This is her 4th or 5th studio release? I haven't seen good work from her since the mid 1990's."
2,I HATE THIS,"i got her CD jagged little pill when it came out years ago and it was my personal anthem... I had to replace it about three times and counting. Even still when i hear her orginal CD on the radio I drop everything and go to a standstill. with that said I cannot be the only disapointed in whats happening to this artist. This crap is solid bubblegum. Its way better then her last few CD""s IN A WAY. she seems so SELF INVOLVED to me I seriously dont understand this progression from her First CD to what "" has become of her"" in all the music released since'.I AM STILL WAITING for a REAL CD from this woman.... like everyone else. Instead of this CD purchase some cool new music by someone just starting out IN the SPIRIT of what alantis almost WAS ""ALMOST""... as i write this my 12 year old daughter just shut off this new CD ""Chaos"" saying "" UGH GAD THIS IS TOO ANNOYING"". .. and she ADORES Jagged little pill~!(...)"
2,So called rip off!,"What do you call a CD publisher who neglects to list the CD time length on the outside of the pkg, so you only find out that it's only half a CD after you open the pkg and are out the bucks, a rip off. At only 41 mins. and with only a few good songs, sorry but I feel burned. And whats with Alanis pimping AOL? Releasing this 41 min. CD seems like a giant step backwards in terms of giving value for the purchase."
2,Disappointing,"This album is definitely a disappointment. I purchased it thinking it might capture some of the past magic of Jagged Little Pill...but this album feels like it was rushed together and, other than ""Everything,"" it is very much empty. I find myself skipping through it whenever it comes on my stereo because it just sounds like a lot of noise with very little in the way of creativity or passion. What happened, Alanis?"
2,so called crap,"I bought this for my young teenager and decided to give it a listen. I own her first and second CDs (not really, but her first & second post cutesy pop CDs) and still enjoy them. Seems like she is trying to grow as an artist and performer, but it just comes off appearing self absorbed and seeking pity. Don't waste your money, evidently she has plenty already and it will probably just make her more unhappy."
2,Final Alanis purchase,"If the lyrics were removed from this album I challenge anyone to tell when one song ends and the next begins. It's very much a typical Morrisette album full of 50 cent words and plenty of ""spoken"" lyrics. Under Rug Swept was at least salvageable with a few gems to make it worth the purchase. There is nothing catchy or worth saving on this cd. It is simply boring. I think I liked her better when she was depressed."
4,Nice!,"Alanis' has yet to disappoint on the albums she has put out, and So Called Chaos continues what was started with Jagged Little Pill - and offers a collection of lyrically poignant and introspective commentary on relationships and love, to memorable hooks. Stand out tracks include 'Excuses', 'Doth I protest too much' (excellent!), 'This Grudge' and 'Spineless' (where does this woman come up with these brilliant lyrics?) This is a CD you will play over and over, in your car and in you home; you will sing along to it, laugh to it and cry to it, it is Alanis at her best."
2,so called disappointment,"I'm running into Best Buy thinking how great the new alanis album will be...and then...wham...reality check...I don't like song 1...or song 2...ok I like song 2...kinda...then so on...no, no, no, don't like, don't like, don't like. So here I am upset. What happened to the timeless hooks of Supposed Former? What happened to the massive choruses on Under Rug Swept? Sure, Under Rug was eh compared to Supposed, but it still rocked. All I wanted was one ""Hands Clean"". Just one little ""Hands Clean"". But no...I got ""Everything"" else and wasn't happy about it."
4,Alanis gets comfy,"History will recall So-Called Chaos as the album that marks the point at which Alanis Morissette found her groove. Jagged Little Pill was the energy-pumped breakthrough, Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie the rebellious angst-laden backlash, Unplugged the unjustly overlooked gem, Under Rug Swept a return to melodic pop. So-Called Chaos retrenches, and in fact underlines, all the things we have come to love and hate about Alanis. Her voice is more gorgeous than ever. Her lyrics are more cringe-inducing than ever. Her uncanny ability to write melodies is here in full glory; every chorus is unforgettable. But her songs are, yet again, all about herself. No matter. Those who like her will love this album, and those amazing choruses may win over a few converts. And those who have the patience to really listen to her sometimes-awkward and unwieldy lyrics will find some genuine insights and an ever-growing adult wisdom that's actually pretty impressive."
3,Un-Biased review of So-Called Chaos,"I consider myself an unbias reviewer. I don't hand out five stars just cuz it's my favorite artist or whatnot. This album is not great, based on any standard of any artist. But it's not bad either. Plus, Alanis has built a unique sound for herself, so the stuff that works really works for us.Her most likeable qualities are evident in songs: ""Eight Easy Steps""--catchy hook/chorus, fun lyrics, angsty and urgent. ""Out is Through"" is good for the same reasons. ""Knees of my Bees"" is a fun pop song, and ""Everything"" is the softest love ballad Alanis has ever made--almost new territory for her really. Overall, buy it if you're an Alanis fan, if not, you should just stick to her past albums. Speaking of which, this would definitely be above her 2002 album ""Under Rug Swept"" in its catchiness, but beneath JLP and SFIJ."
4,Solid rock album,"This album gets off to a rocking start with ""Eight Easy Steps"" and keeps up the pace until the last chord of ""Everything."" Alanis retains her quirky sense of humor and strong streak of independence in the lyrical content of the album, which is inspiring. Yet she seems to have left the anger and bitterness behind. We all have to move on, and Alanis does so in the song ""The Grudge"", which appears to address the same person who figured prominently in ""You Oughtta Know"" from her first album.Overall, ""So-Called Chaos"" is not as experimental as ""Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie"" nor as instantly catchy as ""Jagged Little Pill"", but it's a solid effort. You won't regret buying it."
2,"4 for the songs, 1 for the presentation","To me it's a bit of an insult that labels still manufacture and sell cds this short. 10 songs from the '50s and '60s? Come on, that's less than 30 minutes! This isn't a reissue of a classic album, is it? If it was, that would make some sense. But it's not, it's a compilation of some great holiday oldies that should be at least 30 minutes longer. I say even though this is a fairly inexpensive item, save your money for a more thoughtful and beefier compilation. That's what I always tell myself, and then I try to find one and they don't seem to exist. There ARE (at least) 3 decent DIFFERENT cds with the same title, from different labels, all with 10-12 songs of oldies/rock and roll Christmas songs. Someone should combine all 3 on to one 80 minute cd and we could have ourselves a time."
2,OK,"Not what I was expecting , but it still is better than elevator xmas music .... Was searching for rock xmas and there is some out there just not this one"
3,I kind of bland soundtrack,"I read this other guys review, and he gets into the suspicion of Carpenter and such. I will say if someone looked at all the evidence through public record (which I did) they would see there is little evidence but circumstantial and even there the motive is missing save a theory that is not proven about an alleged ""break up"". The soundtrack is good but lacks any movie tie in. Many times movie soundbites are added into soundtracks or scores, here save one score and no soundbites. Unfortuneatly the score of Cranes murder is not on here. Which I thought was very good. The soundtrack is still good but anyone who has read on Crane knows he was a jazz and big band fan, the 70's rock songs on the soundtrack don't mix with the true story of Crane. Its good, but does not mirror the man and story."
4,Just get the Tatooine Maul instead,"I got this Darth Maul first because the Jedi duel was sold out everywhere.I guess that the figure is OK. The action is good, but you have to be careful with the arms if you remove the elastic from around the lightsaber- it's like he has no bones.As for the lightsaber flicking action, well, that's kinda corny, but I suppose it appeals to the kids.Get the Tatooine Darth Maul- the best version, in my opinion"
4,A paean to what once was,"I saw her dance once, and I still dream of that night. Balanchine was at his peak, and Allegra Kent was more than his principal dancer - she was his muse, his passion, his nemesis. And her dancing was incredible. Once a Dancer, Kent's autobiography, chronicles the strange world of famous ballerinas, plagued as most of them are by anorexia, domineering stage mothers, vulnerability to dance gurus, plastic surgery, and a long, long series of self-destructive behavior. Wonderful sketches of other luminaries from her era are included, plus photos, but it's the end of the book that one remembers: the poignancy of someone of Allegra Kent's talents looking back on her life and appreciating in retrospect all that she once was, is heartbreaking."
3,Brown Face Big Master,"The autobiograpy was interesting but the language used seemed a bit stilted. Perhaps this is because the writer was raised in the West Indies during the 1940's. Nonetheless, the book provides insight into the life a West Indian immigrant in the UK."
4,Some kids like intricate stories without being pushed at all,*sigh* The assumptions others have drawn at the thought of a younger child who enjoys Shakespeare or other classics! My 5.5 year-old liked the sound of a BBC radio version of The Tempest that I was listening to and wanted more stories like it so I ordered this. She totally enjoyed this. I would like to assure our friends over the pond that she is otherwise perfectly normal and enjoys Spongebob just as much.
2,Too complex for my children,"My 9 year old son loves shakespeare, he is starting to learn shakespeare in school. I read with him he could not understand much of what was written. Would be more fun for kids if written in kids language. I give 2 stars because I actually do like it. However it was supposed to be for kids."
4,Contains concepts I will never forget!,"Pat Riley is such an effective communicator. In this book, there are great examples of what it takes to reach the top of any profession, and find success in life. He talks a great deal about ""attitude"" and how it can change everything, just like flipping a switch, a person can turn everything into something positive just by having the right attitude. He also discusses effort a lot, and molds into the reader how effort can even hide a lack of talent. It's a very good read."
4,Quality Latin Shoes,This is the second pair of these shoes I've purchased. They are comfortable right out of the box without a break in period.
4,It is uncomfortable.,"It comes bit smaller and to be honest, once you put your feet in it, it isn't too pretty. 2-3 of the front toes stick out which is not so cute. Maybe I need to break it in a little more but it is bit uncomfortable. something is pinching my feet. the shoes are leather but they are not ""soft"" high quality leather. I think this shoe is pricey for this kind of quality."
1,WRONG SHOES!,this is the first time that i have a major complaint about buying shoes on amazon. i ordered latin t-strap capezio dancing shoes and got some hideously ugly sandals instead. i spent over an hour on the phone witgh newport only tobe put through a really tedious process of having to return the shoes and waiting a while for my refund.....really annoying
1,"Very bad, I didn't get the shoes in the picture I got very cheep flat dandle","I didn't get the shoes in the picture. I got very cheep flat dandle few dollar worth. Too badI call the company and they say it was their worker mistake. But they didn't have the right shoes. They were willing to exchange it for another order but I will have to pay the shipping. Too bad, I will never buy from them!"
3,"""Acid Eaters"" is a trip.","I admit, this isn't the best ""Ramones"" disc ever, but it's something fun. I actually think half of these covers work really well, it's the other half that's just so-so. Overall I'd call this a must for the fanatic, but others could pass on it. I will say this though, most cover songs usually make me want to hear the artist covered, but in this case, I just want to hear more ""Ramones""."
3,Not the best...,"Acid Eaters is by no means a bad album, it just doesnt hold up to the Ramones standards.Releasing an entire album of 60s phycodelic cover songs doesnt seem to be a good idea for the Ramones and the results are mixed.Some songs on here are very enriched by the Ramones touch and manage to sound very punk. But other songs are a little boring.I did notice that Joey doesnt seem to be giving 100% on this album. The songs that CJ sings have alot more energy than the ones Joey does. However, the Substitute and When I was Young are excellent, excellent songs. Joeys vocals on when I was young sent chills down my spine; he managed to sound as desprate as on Needles and Pins from the Road to Ruin Album.Journey to the Center of the Mind, Shape of things to come and My back pages are all great tunes as well.Some of the other songs seem very forced though. All in all, a mixed bag. I would recomend this album to hardcore fans only."
3,Leave your cares behind,"This, of course, is the Ramones' infamous all covers album. It's actually not as bad as many people, including the Ramones themselves, seem to think. ""Journey to the Center of the Mind"" and ""Substitute"" are excellent, and the rest are at least decent. No out and out stinkers here. None of the songs here are included on any of the various Ramones compilation albums, so it is a must have for any serious Ramones fan. The casual fan may want to pass on it."
2,Poor Selection of Songs...,"I always believed you could take any catchy tune and make it sound 'punk' by singing it really really fast over a loud distorted guitar. Unfortunately the Ramones test this premise on 'Acid Eaters' with mixed results. This is a Ramones cover album of 1960s tunes. Some songs like 'Substitute' work very well, and others -- like Bob Dylan's 'My Back Pages' simply don't fit the fast and loud transition. The Ramones have always chosen their covers well (Their version of 'Needles and Pins' may be the definitive one), but the selection of songs here is a let-down. If you could choose only one Stones song for the Ramones to cover, would you have chosen 'Out of Time'..? Proceed with caution."
2,ramons could have Done better rip joey,the ramones are the Greatest punk band of all time.but this album is not one of there best but im stilla fan so i will not bash it too much hey ho lets go .
3,"WELL, it's the RAMONES...","ACID EATERS, the covers album by the RAMONES got some cool songs like SUBSTITUTE...but this must be the RAMONES album that i really don't care....sorry, guys...i love the RAMONES classic style, and i'm not a real covers album fan....but hey...it's the RAMONES, and if you enjoy their bubble gum rock punk, you may enjoy this one..."
3,Acid Burns,"This is one of the odder birds in the Ramones' discography. From a band known for its stellar covers, an album of nothing but. It's a great idea that doesn't always hit the target. For example, Jan and Dean's ""Surf City"" is the kind of beach-rock that would have fit in on any of The Ramones' early albums, and it definitely belongs here. But Bob Dylan's ""My Back Pages"" just doesn't transfer into the punk format. There are some wonderful inspirational moments here (Pete Townshend's yelping on ""Substitute"" alone is worth having this CD), just not enough. ""Acid Eaters"" serves as a reminder to who The Ramones had their radio ears plugged into during their growing years, but is otherwise for completists only.Now if we could only get a compilation CD of all the various covers from their entire career!!!!!"
1,NIce watch but broke within 3 months,The pin came out the watch on the attachment to the face. Hard to find a repair place. Happened in less than 90 days.
3,Biased,"An intimate portrait of Rhodes by one who knew him well, but very biased in his favor. Jourdan idolized Rhodes. He blames the Boers for the Boer war and demeans the black natives as ""boys"". ""The native mind moves very slowly,"" he writes. ""We were tired to death of the sight of them."" He acknowledges that Rhodes was an imperialist, but thought that was a good thing. ""We are all proud to call ourselves imperialists."" The British Empire trumped all.Jourdan knew Rhodes for only about seven years but, as his private secretary, gives unique insights into his life during that time. Interesting inside view of the siege of Kimberley. This book is not a biography of Rhodes, but a slice of his life."
1,May be a cheap MP3 player....But BEWARE!!!,I was in a search for an MP3 player much like yourself when i saw that this product appeared to be the best buy. It's sound quality is great and visually it is nice. HOWEVER...if you are on anti-shock mode don't expect your batteries to last much over 3 hours. And on regular mode you are lucky with 5 hours. It is not at all cost affective if you look at how much batteries are these days. I had mine for 6 months when all of a sudden it just stopped working. I treated this thing like my baby because being in college the money doesntcome easy. IT JUST STOPPED WORKING. I'm not the only one i heard this happened to either. It is in your best intrest to look somewhere.
5,Superior quality for less.,"I'm very proud to say that this player has been excellent. The technical support staff is responsible and very helpful. While it was being shipped I sent them an e-mail about information about the firmware upgrades and they replied within 30 mins. I myself work for technical support and we are not as efficient as these guys, kudos to Raul Montes at tech support; he really helped out. After doing all the upgrades I found there to be no problems at all. Although I did come accross something, the snake game has to be played from the remote control after performing all the upgrades. Awesome savings for a superior product."
2,kiddie player,"Yes, it has tons of features to fuss around with, but it is seriously lacking in the quality of sound. I gave it at least 2 stars because it would've been a really practical player if not for the ... sound. The sound is just sub par. I'm sending it back."
3,Not as good as expected,"When I first bought this Cd/MP3 player I thought I was getting a great deal. Little did I know, now I find myself searching for a new Cd/MP3 player. There are a lot of good things about this also. With the headphones it comes with it has a very nice sound, the LCD is also very nice which makes it easy to navigate the hundred of songs you can put on one cd. The cons about this is when you are playing regular cd's it skip pretty easy, the battery life on a regular cd is very, very short, it is also very bulky. If all you are looking to do is play mp3 cd's then this is a good choice but if you are looking to play regular cd's I would go with a cd/mp3 player with a higher anti skip."
4,MP3 Player with RICH features,"Recently bought this MP3 Player. Here is the summary of features bundled in this player.Pros:1. Auto Resume feature (Remembers upto 10 CDs, according to the manual)2. Navigation by Folder as well as navigation by track (+10 OR -10)3. ID3 Tag Support4. Car Kit5. Wired Remote6. Upgradable firmware (Download and install upgrades)7. Progressive Scan8.

Rich and User friendly Menu optionsCons:1. Slightly heavier, but that is not a problem for me.2. Wish there is a BASS Boost !!3. No AC Adapter (120V - 4.5V)4. No Built-in Charging facilityBottom Line:Really enjoy this player for the features I got with the price I paid"
1,realy bad,"I will Never ever buy another Item from this people I'm so disapointed, because when I see the word (wood)I don't understand I get a product that is not. and also is so unreal so fragil is amazing you sale some thing like that and not put acoment like this is not for real (fishing rods)this's just a toy or for decoration for some one that has realy bad taste."
1,junk,This was a piece of junk. The rods would not even stand up in it without tipping over. Real poor design and construction. I ended up throwing it away. I recommend buying something else.
1,Dissapointment,This fish rack is for kids..not the serious fisherman. I never got to use it because the flimsy pieces never worked. I had to toss this rack in the trash on the day that I recieved it.
4,Doesn't take up too much room and serves its purpose,"I read a review before I bought it. I did not think it was a bad deal for the price and any REAL fisherman could easily tell it was small from the picture. Look at the rods its holding! Also, it doesn't say its real wood so whomever bought it before me clearly reads a book by its cover. Its cute, holds up to 12 rods which is nice and has a little drawer and hooks on the sides. It is not made to last forever but if you take care of your things it should last a few years. I didn't add the wheels because it made it a little less sturdy. The packaging was ridiculous. They threw the box inside a larger box without any packing material. They threw in a large stack of advertisements and the box came very beaten up. We were afraid the pieces were going to be broken. I don't think I'd buy from this seller again mainly because of how poorly packaged it came and I didn't have time for them to send another one had it been broken because it was a gift."
3,Fishing Rod Rack Review,It looks really nice and very accessable but the poles do not stay in place. If bumped or moved the poles fall out. Attached a towel rack to it and it keeps the poles from falling. Looks good still too. Also when I ordered the rack it was 39.99. Before it was even delivered to me the price had gone down to 26.79. I inquired about getting the reduced price and told no can do. A little disappointed.Thank you!Julie Tenney
1,Sloppy,"Too Loose and sloppyTim's DVD by the same title is especially bad. The production is good but Tim's technique is quite sloppy even for quick studies.Better choices would be ""14 Formulas for Painting Fabulous Landscapes"" by Barbara Nuss and ""Painting Better Landscapes"" by Margaret Kessler other notable publications by Gregg Kreutz, David Leffel and Richard Schmid would be a wise investment."
4,True stories must be remembered...,"Swastika Over Paris recounts, as a result of research and interviews by the author, the true stories about unconnected Jewish people during the Nazis occupation in Paris, and especially about a very young French Jewish girl who was not deluded about what was going on, and a very rigid minded Jewish man who believed that if he toed the line he and his family would be spared. This book is a lesson about how fear and anger inspires our decision to rebel, or to submit, and the price of either choice."
5,A very pleasurable and interesting experience.,"During the 1998 Christmas season, I had the unexpected joy of hearing John Michael Gray live. I was taken by the lyrical complexity he accomplished with a solo piano. That album was on my CD player throughout the season and will be a regular part of my future Christmases as well. Having listend to George Winston, Liz Story and other solo pianists, it was very pleasing to find an artist who brought new and fresh interpertations to the music and the instrument. I look forward to enjoying his other albums"
1,not even a layman can use this,"A complete waste of money on my part. I have read chapter 2 over and over,thinking ""perhaps I missed something."" But alas, I can not seem to figure out the damned compass. Do not waste your hard earned money on this item. Your better off taking the classes at an R.E.I. outdoors store. The little test at the end of the book is not enough to make anyone confident anywhere. The one thing this book was good for was keeping me warm out in the wilderness when I threw it in the campfire. Perhaps invest in a more thorough navigation book, and pass on this mediocre one."
5,Get it.,"Good info. Good reference. I would buy this again. It came in excellent condition, onetime. It's always a good idea to review more then one source of information."
3,compass101,"I wanted a book on map reading and this book is heavily weighted toward compass use. Even the GPS section is compass-centric. The maps used as examples were poor resolution and really didn't do a very good job of identifying features that you'd want to recognize on the map. I'm still looking for such a book, so if you've got a recommendation, I'd love to get it."
3,"Wilderness Navigation: Finding Your Way Using Map, Compass, Altimeter & Gps (Mountaineers Outdoor Basics)","OK BOOK WORTH THE MONEY. ISSUES ARE THE BINDING IS WEAK AND PAGES ARE STARTING TO FALL OUT IF I WANT TO TAKE IT OUT ON THE TRAIL FOR REFERENCE. ALSO, IMAGES RELATIVE TO INSTRUCTION ARE ON THE SMALL SIDE. IF YOU WANT A GOOD BOOK THAT GETS TO THE POINT THIS IS THE ONE. THE PRICE IS NOT A KILLER SO WHY NOT GO FOR IT. I DID, I AM NOT DISAPPOINTED."
3,Wilderness navigation,"This book may be small enough to carry as a primer on land navigation for folks venturing into the wilds without knowledge or experience of map and compass skills.However, as a text on land navigation skills it was disappointing. Better choices would be the Land Navigation Handbook: The Sierra Club Guide to Map and Compass by W. Kals (excellent) or M. Ferguson's GPS Land Navigation: A Complete Guidebook for Backcountry Users of the NAVSTAR Satellite System (also excellent)."
3,It really is a good starter book,"The book was alright. It covered only the basics and did not serve the purpose I had in mind. It is on the Special Forces supplemental reading list, and to be honest, I don't know why. It has no information in it that is not already in the FM's for land nav. I was truely disappointed but for a layman, this is a good book to get you started. Don't get lost."
5,ATTRACTIVE MULTI USE CRUET,"Classically designed this clear glass cruet goes well with most table settings, whether a country breakfast, French lunch, informal or formal dinner.The glass shows off whatever it contains, and happily the stopper does not absorb odors or colors.Not only is it perfect for vinegar or salad dressing but also a fine pourer for maple syrup on those hot cakes o chocolate sauce for ice cream. Even does double duty as a vase!"
1,tiger,This product was not received. It does not even show up on the page of orders that I placed. It was to be a gift but the party did not receive it. I don't know where it is.
1,What The Hell Is Snoop Doing on this Joint!!!!,"I can't believe Snoop would do this. Just goes to show his a big time sell out and will do anything for money. This song is disgusting. The lyrics are awful, Pussycat Dolls can't sing and the beats are terrible. Face it people, pop is garbage threw and threw with a few exceptions. Pussycat Dolls are not one of them!!!!!!"
1,Push The STOP Button,"I thought this was going to be PCD's last so-called ""hit"" until I found out that they'll be coming out with a new album sometime next year. This is getting out of control. These chicks have no talent and Nicole can't sing. But that doesn't matter in this day and age where everything is cheaply made and mass-produced because Americans want their pop music RIGHT NOW. Anyway, I'm not even surprised Snoop Dogg is even on this song. He'll do anything for money. Other than that, I still foresee these girls being one hit wonders. Nicole will probably be the lead singer of another lackluster girl group. I'll giver her credit- the girl gets around."
4,Good Vampire Book,"I enjoyed this book very much, after having read I, Vampire and the Vampire Papers. This book focused more on Niccoleta and less on David Parker. Mr. Romkey made it a point to show just how evil and depraved she really is. If you're a David Parker fan, you'll be a little disappointed. He's not in much of the book. The David Parker in this book is a shadow of his former self. He's pretty pathetic. But, I think that just shows how powerful Niccoleta really is. Even David agrees that he's no match for her. I would love to see another book where David Parker goes up against her. That would be a hell of a fight. The whole cruise thing is kinda over the top. There are so many characters that it's a bit hard to follow at times, especially the part about the voodoo priest. What's that all about?? I really recommend the book, because you get a feel for Niccoleta. The Vampire Papers didn't go into great detail about her past."
4,"good story, wonderful style","What I really like about Smith is his style of writing; languid, somewhat indirect, his hero who almost unwillingly, and certainly unwittingly becomes involved. Some details (medical/forensic) don't ring quite true, but his Havana looks pretty good to an unknowing eye. I'll read it again."
4,Where will Renko go next?,"Renko is one of my favorite characters. Although this isn't the best book in the series, Smith's writing is so sharp and thought-provoking that it really stands apart from 98% of what's out there.A caveat: this book barely stands alone, and I'd recommend reading at least Gorky Park first."
3,Not the page turner I was hoping for,"Having read and thoroughly enjoyed the previous works by Martin Cruz Smith which featured Arkady Renko, I looked forward to Havana Bay. Unfortunately, I found the work to be lacking. Overall, the book was far from horrible, but I was hoping for something on par with Gorky Park (which I thought was fantastic) and didn't get it. Perhaps Renko's sense of melancholy and the depressing portrayal of life in Havana was simply too much for me, but there did not seem to be the usual zip here. I have Wolves Eat Dogs on the bookshelf. Hopefully it will prove to be closer to Gorky Park that this was."
5,A tangled web,"Havana Bay is a fine book. As in Smith's other novels of Russian life there is darkness, ambiguity and shadow. Much of the novel takes place in the dark, among ruins, with the central character wearing a heavy black overcoat even in the tropical heat. As Arkady Renko slides in and out of ruined buildings and the murky pollution of Havana Bay so too this novel evokes the destruction of greed and the loneliness and depravity of the soul.That this most Russian atmosphere is set in Havana, Cuba in the bright glare of the tropical sun is Martin Cruz Smith's statement of the enduring and universal nature of human depravity.But the heaviness of the novel is offset by the brilliance of detail, the writer's descriptions of Havana and its inhabitants, and of the sociology of life under the reign of Castro. The seduction of the small love story and the unravelling of motives, actions and consequences make this a most worthwhile investment of a reader's time and imagination."
3,Finding a meaning to live in a very strange place ... at the end of a baseball bat.,"This isn't Michael Chabon, but it could have been?There is existential realism in this novel.With Russia in a very ""lost"" eraone can ask :""Is Cuba a Communist Heaven or Hell?""A very strange death in an an inner tube( could be symbolic?) of a fellow who isn't so mucha friend as being as being not an enemy in a way rescues the lostArkady. Reluctant romance should be no surprise, but is.My bone with this bookis that the author has better in himand choses to write popularly."
4,"Not his best, but good fare","I absolutely adored ROSE so I wouldn't have complained should he have kept writing in that vein. That said, I'm not about to complain about another Renko. Cruz Smith is up to his usual tricks, with smooth, engaging writing and a strong plot. Several details that made GORKY PARK and POLAR STAR so absorbing are missing a bit here, though, such as secondary and supporting characters as interesting and mysterious as Renko. Still and all, Havana's a lush, dramatic setting for this and I do think if you're a fan of his work there isn't too much to be disappointed about here.And if you're divided about whether to buy this or the new LeCarre, pick this one up."
4,Good Read,"Hard to get started, but hard to put down once I got into it. Mr. Cruz is a great storyteller. Havana Bay isn't as ""dark"" as Gorky Park and not quite as good, but I enjoyed reading it."
3,I'm so confused!,"I had to shuffle back and forth when I reached the ending to get what happened finally! This is the fourth novel in the series and it is the least best. The start was very good and it went on until the end when I was expecting a more dramatic ending. If you are a fan of Arkady Renko or Martin Cruz Smith then you must read this one. The decadence of the environment is sexy (yes! I find it very sexy!) and all four books have that X factor! But the end was just not what I wanted it to be or expceted it to turn out. A letdown for me in other words. I would say that ""Gorky Park"", is the best then followed by ""Red Square"" then ""Polar Star"" and then this. But I wish that the series will not end with this one. I want more sexy decadence and depression please!"
1,"Dense Plot, Turgid Pace Make for Sloggishness","HAVANA BAY is a complete waste of time. Worse, it wastes the vitality of Smith's wonderful creation, Arkady Renko. True, Smith has never been one for pace and fluid plot mechanics, but his latest is so bogged down in uninteresting facets such as Havana's detailed history and a muder investigation with absolutely no immediacy to it that it turns banal and boring, with ridiculous, overreaching delusions of grandeur. The pits."
2,I'm Tired of Arkady,"Either Arkady is getting *extremely* tired or I'm tired of him. He seems to go down hill with every book.What really annoyed me about this book is the Spanish which is not translated for those of us who have a language ""deficiency.""Arkady may be Mr. Smith's bread winner, but ""Stallion Gate"" and ""Rose"" were much better books."
1,Totally Unhappy,I have never received this item nor have I received any communications about this item from the vendor.
2,Rather too put-downable...,"Hasn't any one noticed? This book is supposed to be a thriller. But it's slow. An interesting setting is one thing, but when it overwhelms the action, then you're not getting a thriller any more, but a travel book. I'd rather get my hard information on Cuba from a non-fiction source, thank you. In short: not enough fun in the sun."
3,A Solid Thriller,"This was a pretty reasonable book. The plot was good, although the ending was a bit anit-climatic. Like many modern novels, I found this one to have a bit of a Jekyll and Hyde character. The beginning was very interesting and kept you reading, but once characters had become established and you felt ""comfortable"" with the atmosphere, the story just kind of puddled out. There were two aspects of this book that I found very interesting. First, the main character is highly depressed (although the author kind of forgets this about half way through the story)and we get to the see the world through the eyes of a protagonist who seems ""dead"". Second, I really enjoyed seeing the interactions between the old Cold War allies. The Eastern bloc et al. has always fascinated me and it was fun to a glimpse of thier now less-than-friendly relations."
3,Plods nicely,"The fourth Arkady Renko novel. Here he travels to Havana to identify the body of a Russian found dead in Havana Bay.The facts don't add up and he persistently digs into the circumstances. Along the way he enlists the help of a Cuban Policewoman ,(never ugly,always beautiful,obviously unattractive woman are never helpful!!).After seeing William Hurt portray Renko in 'Gorky Park' he is forever this character when I read about him, his slow pedantic speech and manner was played superbly by Hurt so this book just rocks along slowly, sometimes so slowly the book treads water, but its a good story. And like most things 'follow the money'."
1,Cruz Gets Some Serious Religious Matters Wrong,"I was looking forward to reading HAVANA BAY because Havana, the musics and the many religions of Cuba matter a great deal to me and my friends.I was shocked and disappointed that not only once, but several times, it is announced in HAVANA BAY that the Abakua religion is from the Congo region of Africa, when even the most elementary book on African Diaspora religions will inform you correctly that the Abakua come from the Calabar region of what we now know as Cameroon, close to present-day Nigeria. Cruz also wrote about the religions as if they were some sort of cheap Hollywood horror venture; nor, despite putting so much of this in the novel did it actually bear upon the plot.This is not the best book that Cruz has written. It reads too much as though the author was plugging in his research to fit his plot template, rather than having the plot emerge from something he knew well, and respected, if not loved."
1,not very interesting,and couldn't identify with any of the characters. the story was weak uninteresting and irrelevant. Only made it to about the 5th chapter
3,Wish an Arkady Renko really did exist!,"I will read any book that Martin Cruz Smith stars Arkady Renko. I wish people in real life were that caring. This book is not as good as, of course, Gorky Park (I also loved Polar Star), but again I could not put it down as with the others (Red Square, also); It always made me wonder what was going to happen next; I just read and read and I hate when his books end, even though I'm dying to know the ending!I can't wait for the next Arkady Renko story, but please, Mr. Cruz Smith, promise us you will never turn our Arkady into silly putty the way Thomas Harris did to Clarice Starling in that awful book, Hannibal."
4,Not a nice place to visit -or live there,"Smith uses his elegance with the language to capture both the corruption and corrosion of today's Havana - and he does it with an intriguing story that's totally believable. Humour, too, adds to the story-telling, as does the hyperbole (the potholes on Havana streets can be seen from the moon)all of which keep you riveted until the final page. Great stuff in the tradition of Graham Green and John LeCarre."
3,Not his best,"Since reading a book review about Mr. Smith's latest book in the series, ""Stalin's Ghost,"" I decided to re-read ""Gorky Park"" and then work my way through the others in chronological order. I just finished ""Havana Bay,"" and found it lacking.My main complaint with ""Havana Bay"" is that it seemed, to me, that Mr. Smith was working just a bit too hard to make the plot complex. He succeeded at that, but at the expense of a tighter and more enjoyable narrative.That said, the character he created in ""Gorky Park,"" Arkady Renko, is delightful to follow. This series reminds me so much of Maj Sjowall and Per Wahloo's wonderful Martin Beck mystery series set in Sweden in the 60s.""Havana Bay"" was interesting, but, so far, it ranks as the weakest link in the series."
2,Tape garbled,I found it difficult to follow this book because the third tape was defective and I had to skip it. Frank Muller's excellent narration helped make up for it.
5,Patsy Cline,I wanted to hear singing. Too much documentary talking. We will never hear a great voice like this again. The makers of this film should realize we want to hear Patsy sing.
5,It's GREAT but...,"...it would be even better, if that had the unedited version of Fiesta (Remix) on it...If they're gonna put that on there, it needs to be unedited or leave it out. They didn't edit out I WISH, so why edit out Fiesta (Remix). In that case, they should have put, IF I CAN TURN BACK THE HANDS, in it's place.I hate to hear a song with edited out lyrics...that's why they have the option to buy the Explicit Version and Clean Version...Other than that...this cd is tha BOMB!Favorite Songs: ALL OF THEM with the exception of Fiesta Remix, dayum!"
5,It's That SH**!,"This is the best R&B greatest hits I've heard because for one it's by the ""Pied Piper"". There's a variety of hits he had like ""Bump N' Grind"", ""Ignition"", ""Step In The Name Of Love"", Thoia Thoing"", ""I Wish"" and my personal favorite ""When A Woman's Fed Up"". This great for any occasion (except for church). Good for slow dancing and stepping game. Get this, bump this, play it all day, UNDERSTAND ME!"
5,Great. QUICK RECEIPT!,This was a great CD! I was trying to find the song WHEN A WOMAN LOVES but this sounded great and IT IS! THANKS SO MUCH for QUICK RECEIVE.
4,R in R&B Collection 1,I am very pleased because I received this product in good condition and in a timely manner.
4,charming & HOT love story,"Got a chance to see this fun movie in Austin - I guess it was filmed in a small TX town nearby. The story is very mature, and I thought it was a fresh take on gay relationships. It is also very funny! One of my only criticisms is that the production budget seemed very low - maybe that's why the scenes sometimes look stiff and the acting feels a bit staged. Despite those flaws, I really had a great time watching this movie. Oh, and the young actor playing the lead is gorgeous - with a beautiful body and totally adorable smile!"
2,"I had never assumed that ""low budget"" would be synonymous with ""low quality"" until I watched Angora Ranch","Horrendous acting, poor cinematography, uninspired dialogue, and the list goes on. I had never assumed that ""low budget"" would be synonymous with ""low quality"" until I watched Angora Ranch. On a scale of 1 to 10 (in ascending order), I would give ""Private Romeo"" a 10 and leave Angora Ranch at 1. The theme of Angora Ranch that age is no barrier to finding true love was somewhat sweet, I will give it that. The execution, though, was, in a word, deplorable. I didn't enjoy watching it and I certainly wouldn't recommend it."
2,"Cute storyline, but the final product is poor","After I had read the summary of the story I was really happy that there was finally a gay theme movie about relationship with an age gap in the background.But then I started to watch and realized in a blink of an eye that the final product is quite miserable.The low budget factor is visible in every single minute of this film. But it is not the worst. And it is not the reason I give it only 2 stars.It is the acting.It seems as if 95% of the crew was cought in the street and set in front of the camera...The last 5% is reserved to Tim Jones who portrayed Jack's father (btw, he past away year after the film was released).Unfortunately, it is hard not to notice that he was too young to play a 60 year old pa (check out the scene where he appears chest naked - hottie).Well, I would lie if I wrote that I didn't enjoy it. But I wouldn't book for it a place in my dvdteque neither."
2,"Sweet spirit, but unwatchable","This movie's intentions are SO good that I really wanted to like it, but everything about it is SO bad that I just couldn't. The story is okay, but the dialog is maudlin and unbelievable, and the acting is painful to watch. The problem isn't lack of money, it's lack of talent. Many good movies have been made with no money, but this isn't one of them.The only good thing I can find to say about it is that both Thomas Romano and Paul Bright are attractive and likeable men. But neither of them can act, and the other two actors are just unwatchable. Angora Ranch is about as excruciating as any movie I've ever seen. Its spirit is sweet, and I wish its makers well, but I can't recommend it to anybody."
1,Prozac anyone??,"Reading over the reviews presented here makes me wonder if I had seen the same film as the other reviewers or if maybe their Prozac dosage might not have been a little on the high side.This is without a doubt one of the worst gay-themed films ever made. The acting,if one could call it that, is beyond amateurish,it's cringe inducing. The heavy handed and wink-wink, oh so cute script is truly terrible. That someone would actually provide funding for such a piece of dreck is beyond reasoning.If you want to see an excellent gay film, purchase ""Shelter"" it's flawless!!"
2,Aha. The Debut Album eh?,"It wasn't until I read these reviews that I realized Mental Jewelry was not a new release! I had been laboring under the impression that Throwing Copper was the debut album, and what a debut! I put this one on and thought, Yuck! What the Hell happened to these guys? Now the water clears a bit. I still don't like it. It takes some pretty masterful music to compensate for such inanities as ""the beauty of gray"". Mental Jewelry makes a good stab at it but doesn't come close to the later work."
2,...for 2 good songs.,"The 2 hit songs you heard on the radio are the only good songs on this album. Some of the other songs have thier moments, but are just too annoying as a whole to listen to more than twice."
5,This album is wicked,"Wicked man, i picked this album up from my mates never hearing it before and played it on his hi-fi and i loved it man. My favourite track has to be 'Beauty of Gray'. Man i am going to buy another album so hopefully that will be as good. cheers L"
5,Back before Live turned into REM,"I first heard this album through my flimsy apartment walls. I would bang on the walls to make my neighbor turn it down - but then he let me borrow the CD, and I became the one turning up my music too loud.That was 8 years ago... Mental Jewelry is, and always will be one of the smartest, lyrically intense albums out there. Musically, some of the riffs on Throwing Copper were more radio friendly, but it sounded too much like REM, and the lyrics were shallow(er). I can't comment on the subsequent albums because the songs they played on the radio did not inspire me to go out and get them.I still listen to MJ at least once a week, and have been doing so for the past 8 years. If I were ever to be stranded on a deserted island with a solar powered CD player and just one album, this would be it."
3,Shining moments proved this was a sign of things to come,"I won't say that this is a really great album,but the message of peace and love without the fluffy pompousness of Extreme's""III Sides to Every Story"" or the blatant contradictions of Guns n'Roses ""Use Your Illusion II"" is a welcome change.I guess this one will have to grow on me.The shining moments on this album such as ""Brothers Unaware"" and ""Mirror Song"" proved that this was a sign of things to come,showcased on their last two works."
5,"If you bought ""Throwing Copper"" then this is a must have!","""Throwing Copper"" is one of the best CDs released in the 1990s and so is the not-so-well-known ""Mental Jewelry."" Just as on their sophomore album ""Throwing Copper"" there is not a single bad song on ""Mental Jewelry."" The album grows on the listener more and more as they get farther into the tracks on the CD. The lyrics are very cool and the music rocks. Once you put it on, you can't help but listen to it all the way through to the end. I love this CD. It's one of my favorites (no bias there, huh?). Anyone who likes LIVE needs a copy of this CD, ""Mental Jewelry."" So click the icon already and order it!"
5,makes you think,"when i bought this cd i had just bought secret samadhi also and when i heard this cd it was a little meek compared to the harder edge of samadhi...but i kept listening and listening and this cd just grows on you...the lyrics are a bit easier to interpret in this album...Live is the sort of band that you grow attached to...why not buy all their cds? hell, they're all awesome! go! buy them now!"
4,The beginnings of a great band,"If you're a Live fan, or have just heard ""Heaven"" on the radio and are interested in Live, Mental Jewelry is a must-have album. The songwriting overall is a little less polished than Throwing Copper or Secret Samadhi in terms of imagery or poetic feel, but Ed's lyrics make some very good points about racism, the conflict between religion and spirituality, and other socially relevant topics. The only really glaring problem with this album is the rough production, but that's a minor quibble. I highly recommend Mental Jewelry."
5,Live - Solid Debut Effort,"I first became aware of live after seeing their video from this album. There was something about them that caught me and I went out and picked this album up. The band would go on to fame and fortune hitting the big time a few years later with their ""Throwing Copper"" album, but this their debut disc really paved the way for what was to come. If I could sum up this album with one work I think it would be ""passion"". There is something uniquely passionate about the performances on this album that many bands try for, but few come across as sincere. Like U2 and only a handful of other band's Live has the ability to truly make the listener believe in what they are singing and playing about. This album was recorded when the band members were all still in their teens. As other reviewers have noted the band sounds a lot ""older"" than what they actually were. I really like every song on this disc. If you are a Live fan and don't have this one you should definitely pick it up."
5,Live is Awesome,"I first fell in love with Live when i heard Dolphins Cry on TRL and heard Lightning crashes on internet radio. I wanted to get a cd, so i got Throwing Copper... IT WAS AWESOME! I wanted to hear more of the band, so i Looked up thier albums. All of them are full of soul, love, and toe tapping beats.Its a shame that this cd is ""unnoticed"".. ITS GREAT!!!!"
5,The most profound Live CD there is,"Live has been guilty of getting less and less ""deep"" with their lyrics as their CDs continue to be released. The guitar riffs get better, but the lyrics are lacking on future releases.This CD is the most pure lyrically and is a great mellow CD to listen to. Certainly a great CD to see from where the band has come."
5,Goes beyond music,"Whether you admit it or not music is more than just dancing or banging your head. You can do that to anything. So when intelligent bands with real messages come along, I listen. No band is as thought provoking as Live, their dark journeys through their souls trying to find peace is portrayed with beauty and precision from all four band members. Even after listening to this CD for 6 years I find new feelings buried deep within the meanings of the songs"
5,Proud to own it,"There's something cool about knowing about a band before most anyone else does. The members of Live put out an album under a different name before Mental Jewelry, but this disc was the first introduction I or any of my friends had to them, back in 1992. It's one of the few albums I still listen to consistently from that time.From Pain Lies on the Riverside to Operation Spirit to 10,000 Years (Peace is Now), the lyrics hooked me immediately. From a lyrical standpoint I compare Mental Jewelry to early U2--not subtle, occasionally awkward, but no less powerful for all that.It has been interesting to see Live's development through their subsequent albums, but Mental Jewelry will likely always remain at the top of my personal list from them."
5,another winner from Naxos,"This is another winning compilation from Naxos. My only comment is to provide a heads-up regarding the track list in the booklet. CD 1 puts the Leonin ""Viderunt Omnes"" on six tracks, while the booklet leaves room for only one. Thus, add five to booklet tracks five through 21 for CD1 to get them to match. (e.g., where the booklet says tracks 15 and 16 are two versions of Josquin's ""El Grillo,"" your CD player will show them to be tracks 20 and 21.) With luck this will be corrected in later printings.Also, I would have liked the booklet to include the words, but perhaps that is an inducement to get particular CDs from Naxos.As for the music itself--breadth of selection, musicianship, sound quality, all are excellent. A great collection!"
1,Same old song,"This is a very Biased book toward western medicine. All alternative therapies and herbs, vitamins are considered worthless and extremely dangerous. All research about any thing to the contrary is ignored, Like Milk thistle which has alot of medical research behind it, is considered dangerous and not to be touched unless you have a crufix handy. Good basic information about liver disease but hard to get past the Western doctor, Iam god complex."
3,Western Med,This book is PRO- Western Med and the authors bias is very clear. Continued bashing of non-traditional or eastern med is very clear. She expresses clear findings on Inerferon and indicates for the most part no conclusive data on herbal alternatives.
1,Crap!!!!! Save your money,"When bought this, I had the thought that it would be a compliation of some of her work from the ""golden years"". All this was was a collection of grainy low quality videos. Nothing that I expected, just save your money."
1,don't trust these reviewers,"i would give it 0.1 star, my friend gave it to me, i wouldn't ever buy this booklet for more than $5 myself. i read 10 pages and threw it away.it is a booklet and full of trash talk. so many fake reviews on amazon trying to promote their books these days"
3,A fast moving spy novel.,"I was not familiar with the story of Elizabeth Pack, so I was continually wondering how closely it followed history. Believability was stretched in the recruitment of Elizabeth, but overall, a good, solid read."
2,Average,"This was not the blockbuster action book I was looking for. It is just another in the crowed field of World War Two historical fiction. With so many books out there this one just does not rise to the top of the class. I do questions some of the proposed facts, that they may be closer to the author's imagination. Don't get me wrong; the story was ok and different from the normal in the class. The writing was good and the author does keep the book moving for the most part. It just did not grab the reader."
1,World War II Spy Novel meets Danielle Steel,"Ok if I didn't read Aaron's other book I wouldn't have read another one after reading this. First his over drama with the heorine gets one to the point of thinking ""Is this woman nuts?""It makes the British SIS seem like a bunch of goofballs and it's a miracle then did anything. It would have been nice to have read the book without hearing how every male wanted to sleep with Mrs. Pack or how she wanted to vice-versa. If I didn't know better I would think she's a nympho.SPOILER WARNING:She has affairs left and right and meanwhile it gives her husbanda stroke. He writes about a German Lt. who angsts over his assignment and then kills him (but of course he's got to think how beautiful the heorine is). The use of Churchill was a waste and sterotypical."
4,Non-mecury stuff seperated... very annoying but fixed now,"I was very happy when the thermometer arrived only to be frustrated that the non-mercury fluid stuff had separated and I could not shake it down. I heated it up so all of the fluid rejoined, but when I shook it down a bit still stayed at the top! I could not use this $20 device unless I could get all rejoined and down. Finally I saw another review here suggesting using a sock... hooray, it worked. The chunk at the top came down once I swung it with massive force in the sock. I am now very happy and the thermometer finally works and works well. If anyone else has this problem, follow the other reviewer's sock method."
4,Does it's job,"Item is easy to use and correctly displays the temperature if properly shook down, it does require a little shaking force.Disclaimer: My wife is a registered nurse and was taught how to use such equipment in school."
2,Great until it broke and wouldn't hold temp,"The thermometer was great for awhile. After I got pregnant, (charting on Fertility Friend really helped) I kept taking my temp to watch for miscarriage and eventually the thermometer wouldn't hold the temp anymore. It went up but soared back down as soon as I took it out of my mouth. Since I had a miscarriage, I will probably order another one, but more reluctantly. Maybe I wasn't careful enough with it.Update: bought another one, that one broke too. Stick with digital if you tend to break things easily. The digital work just as well. It's kind of a pain to have to shake the glass to get the temp back down."
4,Accurate thermometer,"This is a great thermometer, very accurate. Not super fast to read but at least it was accurate.The sock ""fan"" method to get the thermometer down worked perfectly for me too. HIghly recommend this over the digital basal thermometers. Those fluctutate within a range of 0.1-0.4F so there's really no point if you're using those to track body temperature."
1,Non-mercury Glass Basal Thermometer,I would never recommend this product. The material that is supposed to mvoe up and down did not budge (stuck at 97.3) so I threw it out. Anymore money wasted on this product (shipping) would have added insult to injury!!! Very poorly designed!I'm sticking with my digital thermometer!
5,EASIEST Way to shake down this very good thermometer!!!!,Much easier than shaking this in a sock!! All you need to do is run it (totally) under very warm water for less than a minute. Then it will shake down very easily. No need to swirl around in a sock until your arm falls off. Thermometer is very easy to read and use. Like it a lot.
1,Broken after two uses,"I thought this was my answer to a reliable thermometer. It wasn't. After two uses, it stopped working. The basal dye wouldn't come back up to read the temp."
3,"At first useless, but alas it works!!!","I first tried the thermometer in conjunction with a digital thermometer. I found both to read the same. However, I began to get suspicious of my digi, so I decided to start using the non-mercury. However, the temp was stuck! No matter how I hard I shook and flicked and did everything I could, the non-merc wouldn't move. I was so mad! I only got to use it once!!!Fast forward - for some reason i kept it. I forgot my primary therm, so I went for this one while on the road. I was able to easily shake it down and use it. I have no idea what kept it from moving last time, but it works now and is reliable.I have no problems shaking the non-merc down when its isn't stuck. I had no idea it could get stuck. Overall, its good, but i just wonder when it'll get stuck again....not ideal for a much needed temping day around O."
4,as advertised,"This thermometer does exactly what is supposed to do. We got it after getting frustrated and doubting the reliability of digitals. It works better than many reviews say. I wake up, shake it down (2-3 shakes of a slow, sleepy wrist) hand it off to my wife and in 5 minutes we've got a reliable number. I like it because I never think about whether its working or not; it always does."
3,Hard to shake down,"This is a very nice, sturdy thermometer with a handy feature of the magnifying case, which makes it easy to ready the temperature. HOWEVER, it is very hard to shake the ""mercury"" (the fake mercury) down! I have used regular mercury thermometers in the past and have never had this problem. This is a particular problem when you are charting and taking your temperature every day. Maybe there is some trick I don't know about, but i doubt that shaking a thermometer down is rocket science! I'd appreciate any tips!"
3,Quality Control Issues,"I'm in the health care business and purchased eleven of these thermometers (made by Geratherm). I ran a dozen tests on them (put them in a water bath at carefully selected different temperatures) and found that one of the eleven was consistently 0.6 degrees cold. Another one was slightly questionable.So overall I consider these thermometers to be of excellent quality, but beware of getting the odd one in ten that is defective."
5,Excellent thermometer for NFP,"I have broken countless mercury thermometers and hate digital ones because they are so variable (take your temp 5 times and get 5 different readings)and many did not keep the temperature recorded, so that at 6:00am, I'd have to turn on a light to write down my temp.This is as good and reliable as mercury without the danger and breakability."
1,Fragile!,We broke two of these before we gave up and bought a digital one. Because you have to shake it hard to get it ready to use it's very easy to drop it. And you only have to drop it once for it to shatter. The product works like it is supposed to but digital is much less of a hassel.
5,Cinderella Doll,The doll seemed very sturdy and well made. I gave it to my 3 year old granddaughter for Christmas.
2,Bring a barf bag,"After reading several great reviews on this game, I forked out the money and sat down to play. I'll admit beforehand, I did not get very far. What I want to comment on is the growing trend in games that in order to celebrate the detail in the graphics, the behind the player camera angle is so close it takes about 15 minutes of play before vertigo sets in and your checking to see if a barf bag is handy. The new Dawn of Mana game is one of the worst offenders of this. The Mana series of games have been some of the best, but I am putting this one up on Ebay and selling it. It is just unbearable.I suspect the over zealous game reviews on games like this are nothing more than the efforts of pre-game launch hype. I am dissapointed that Square Enix did not deliver. As I remember the first in the series ""Secret on Mana"", a very hard to find game I might add, I wonder why they struck out so bad on this one."
3,Not a bad game,I am enjoying playing this game. The shipment came at a reasonable time after it was purchased. Great Job !
5,Finnish Gothic Master Work of Art!!!,"This is a great song to go along with an amazing cd to match. From Wicked Game to Join me... this CD and band rocks. it's a shame they are not too known in the states, because they are not to be missed!!!~Rakkaus Ei Koskaan Kuole~Hello MIKKO!!!!!"
5,Get this now,You must get this now it is brilliant. if your collecting HIM stuff you need to get this. it is a collectors item.Owning 20 cds myself this is definetly my fav.JOIN ME/5/5 Taken from Razorblade Romance this is a mellow song and still brill.It's all Tears/5/5 Unplugged version. taken from the song it's all tears (drown in this love).Rebel Yell/5/5 HIMs interprutation of Billy Idols Rebel Yell. This song is definetly much better.Dark Sekret Love/5/5 Non album track and is still amzing like every other HIM song. Actually i think this is on 666 ways to love (out of print very very very rare).
5,Pan's Labyrinth,"Great looking video and great DTS-HD 7.1 audio track. If you have a PS3, it now decodes the DTS-HD track into a PCM for any HDMI receiver. Unfortunately, the PS3 doesn't fully decode 7.1 audio currently, but the 5.1 DTS-HD is still spectacular. I don't really care about special features, however they are good. Well worth the purchase."
5,flawless,This was honestly one of the few movies I have ever seen that I found to be completely perfect. My only regret thus far is that a coffee table book of the art and characters has yet to be released.
5,No English subs for extras disc.,"A beautifully packaged version of this spectacular film. This limited Korean version of the film has English and Korean subtitles for the movie, but only has Korean subtitles for the extras disc, which is predominantly spoken in Spanish. Other than this minor drawback, I thoroughly recommend this as a purchase for collectors."
3,pan's labyrinth,Defferent approach to reality and fantasy that is good try but not very good to concentrate on fantasy itself. The director should give more time for the fantasy sequence than the realistic story. However the image is very nice. If the movie showed more fantasy scenes it would be much much better.
3,A mixture of fairy-tale fantasy and a tough military story - but what exactly is the point?,"""Pan's Labyrinth"" combines fairy-tale fantasy with a tough story about Fascist troops fighting partisans in the Spanish countryside in 1944.The acting is excellent particularly Sergi Vidal as the nasty Fascist Captain.In its combination of fantasy and ""reality"" the film evokes comparison to the Harry Potter series and the films of Peter Jackson - so it's not as original as it might think it is - (check out the mandrakes for a start!)...and one is left wondering exactly what point the filmmakers were trying to make."
4,A Visual Poem,"While this film is spoken in Spanish (with English subtitles available), the Director gives his commentary in perfect English. And his commentary is very worthwhile, so be sure to get a DVD that includes it as bonus material.Guillermo Del Toro's remarks add to the understanding and enjoyment of the film. It's like attending a lively filmmaker's master class. Even if you aren't interested in the art of projecting story and emotion on a screen, you'll still undoubtedly find the talk-over interesting.I had missed so many cinematic nuances the first time through. Del Toro says he conceived the movie as a sort of poem, full of visual rhymes, reflections, and symbols. As he points out his interplay of imagery, the viewer sees deeper into the method and meaning of every scene. While the movie itself involves a fantastical labyrinth, the Director's commentary is a lucid look to the bottom of an enchanted pool."
1,A girl's fairy tale comes to life to maintain her sanity in war torn,Spain. In Spainsh. Artistically dark.
3,Why no English dub?,"5 stars for the film; 3 for the fact that on DVD there's no English dub. This isn't a Criterion artsy-fartsy edition. Yes, I know you're supposed to watch foreign films with subtitles, I've taken film courses. However, Crouching Tiger and Kung Fu Hustle were acclaimed, yet earned dubbing. I saw this flick at the theatre, and it's great, 'though reading all the subtitles distracts me from the VISUAL medium (right, snobs?). Can't some of us low-brows just enjoy a movie without the pretensions? In English?"
1,SUBTITLES,Who wants to read a movie.You miss all the beauty of the cinematography trying to keep up with the stupid reading.SKIP IT!
2,Very Dark Tale...,"I was very much mislead when I went to see this movie.I was at least hoping that the girl would go to the ""other realm"" where there was fairies ect. I really disliked she didn't even go into the ""other realm"" more then 3 times. Unfortunately throughout the movie there is torture and a LOT of gore. Most of the story line is about the little girl's horrible life and how she tries to cope with it. I actually hated how they ended the movie and disliked how I suffered through the whole thing WHILE paying to watch it.All in all, don't watch this if you have a weak stomach, dislike drama, and very dark tales. This is one of those I don't recommend to children under the age of 15."
2,Who knew?,"well this didn't say anywhere it was in Spanish with english sub titles.and not on the package the disk came in...Oh wait down there on the back in really fine print.Please be advised to anyone thinking of purchasing this very violent, for voilence sake movie. IT'S IN SPANISH!!Other then that the popcorn was the only good thing about the evening"
3,Very misleading,"The previews were very misleading for this movie. I was expecting a fantasy movie filled with adventure and magic, but I get to see a man's brains graphically beat in at the very beginning of the movie which immediately didn't sit right with me, and lots of war. Not what I expected at all.The film was shot beautifully though, the acting was great, but I was expecting something different from watching the previews. It was like the magic/fantasy took a back seat to the war and violence."
2,Depressing Fairy Tale,"""Pan's Labyrinth"" may have won many Oscars, but it is gory, overly detailed and just depressing to watch. It shows sadistic behavior and painful situations over and over. This is not my idea of entertainment. The setting is Spain in 1944 and a little girl's belief in fairy tales in a grim and stark time. She has lost her father, her mother is pregnant and very ill, and her stepfather is a brutal Fascist officer. He is only using her mother to have a son to pass on his name and legacy. He could care less about little ten year old Ofelia (Ivana Baquero). How she finds any happiness at all is what the story seems to focus on. It is just a sad, bad movie that tries to be deep and meaningful. It depresses and fails to strike a chord of any redeeming value.Ugh!"
2,Quite Overrated,"I suppose the director of this film thought that if he put in some magical special effects, it would make this movie something special. Unfortunately, the main story is filled with characters who are two-dimensional stereotypes (the evil man, the saintly mother, the housekeeper with a secret). Although little Ofelia's fantasies are quite amazing and wonderful, they don't make up for a film that is brutal and dull at its core. This was a great disappointment to watch."
1,Very very violent and dark,"This was advertised as a ""fairy tale"" or having aspects of one. But maybe 10% of it has to do with the imaginative fairytale aspect of the story. 90% of it is a super violent recounting of a sick sadist's experience of the Spanish Civil War. So expect lots of blood and violence (bashing someone's face in, slicing someone's cheek open, breaking all the bones in someone's hand in a torture session, shooting a child, etc.).I don't necessarily mind this per se but I do think it is a case of false advertising. If they had been honest about what the film was theywould have made less money. So they were cynical in the way they promoted the film.If you liked Saw or Hostel and wished it had more of a historical angle, you might like this movie.And by the way there is no English language audio track so there ya go."
2,Overrated,"Even if this film was meant to be an ""adult"" fairy tale--it was still way too violent. There was a lot of unnecessary violence, such as the murder of the hunters/farmers. Yes, they had to be killed for the purpose of the story, but did the son have to be killed that way? I'm sure the point still would've come through. It was just gratuitous violence. Plus, I found the characters to be one dimensional, especially ""mean"" Capt. Lopez (Ofelia's stepfather), ""obedient"" Carmen (Ofelia's mother), and even ""defiant"" Ofelia herself. The only character who had some depth was the housekeeper. In my book, this was NOT the best picture of the year as some critics are making it out to be. That would go to ""Little Children."""
1,Weak...,Weak. Very weak. This movie is such crap. The director has done some decent films and this isnt one of them....This movie isnt watchable. Its 2 hours of your life you will never get back. The cast is all unknowns. The story is such hogwash. Its just thrown together for a movie. They spent their beer budget for a few parties to make this film. Even the special effects cant save it from the storyline.
4,So where is the fantasy adventure?,"Talk about a misleading preview!! I was excited to see a young girl's journey into a mystical world where she would have to survive her way through; however, the mystical world is seen only a short time during the movie. Is the fantasy world real or not? What is really going on?"
5,A Master Class in Cinematic Myth Weaving,"Take note, Spielberg and Lucas! Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth is a master class on how to go about capturing real magic on film. In order to have true resonance, cinematic myth weaving requires soul, and this film bleeds it with each ensorcelled frame."
3,Excellent CGI but I found the story unappealing,The computer graphics definitely carried this one. I'm glad I watched it on my ROKU from the Amazon channel instead of paying theater prices for this one.
1,"Love the movie, but poor quality","I love this movie. It's 5 stars. But the video on demand quality was horrible, so let me be clear that that's what I'm rating. The audio was very low and the video quality was even worse. This was the first time I've rented a movie from Amazon. And unless I figured out what the problem was, the last. Just to make sure it wasn't the laptop, we put in a blu ray movie from redbox and it played beautifully. May have been the free hotel wifi that had something to do with it, but I don't know."
5,"Excellent movie, great service.",Saw this over the holidays when I was staying at a house with cable and remembered how much I love this movie! Arrived promptly and in great condition. Trustworthy seller - would buy from them again.
5,excellent,it arrived on time. the quelity of the image and sound it excellent and of course the movie itself is excellent
3,Very graphic,"Be aware this is in Spanish with English subtitles. The English is good, but you will miss some of the nuances if you do not speak Spanish. Especially when dealing with The Fawn (Pan).The story did not need all the graphic blood in this show. They could have portrayed the mean general without the shooting and killing... (story killer warning. don't read further if you don't want the story plot ruined) The ultimate murder of the child in the end was awful! Yes, I know she had to die for the story to consummate, but murder by the bad General was awful."
4,pans labyrinth,"Great story, ready to follow. English subtitles helped alot!! This its the first time I sat through the whole movie, and I was not disappointed."
5,Pan's Labyrinth,Awesome Fantasy story. I just saw this Movie back in late Oct. 2012and just now writing my 2cents worth. I think the director did a great job capturing the emotion of each character. I will be seeing this movie again. And I will also add this movie to my Blue Ray Collection. Classic.
4,Dark Fairytale -- Not for Kids!,"Premise: a little girl in Europe during the WW2 era who loves fairy tales is on a trip with her pregnant mom to her mom's new husband's fortress/home, where he was waging war against guerillas. It was obvious from the beginning he was bad news. But the girl keeps seeing ""fairies"" that look rather like insects, and one of them leads her into the heart of a labyrinth where a faun gives her the classic fantasy quest information -- she's the daughter of a king and has to pass 3 tests. With these (weird) tests she will be able to make everything right.This movie was very dark and disturbing in an ""artsy"" way, which a lot of viewers, including myself, enjoy. But do not think because it mentions fairy tales and fairies and magic that it is appropriate for younger children. The storytelling was clear even though it was nontraditional, so even when it was a little surreal, as a viewer I mostly knew what was going on."
1,Wow. Horrible horrible movie...,"Just watched Pan's Labyrinth. I really don't understand how anyone could enjoy this movie. It was violent. The fantasy aspect was destroyed by all the ridiculous amounts of blood and gore. It seemed really... well... gratuitous. Seeing the gore didn't advance the plot. It was just a spectacle of yuckiness.Don't understand why all my geeky fantasy-loving friends were so adamant about it being freakin' awesome. The director is so whingingly emo that I would be eager to help him cut himself while crying bitter tears of blood, poetically smudging his khol-black mascara, lipstick and nail polish. Yeah."
1,The movie is in Spanish with English subtitles,"I was so upset to find that this was spanish with english subtitles. None of the most helpful reviews tell you this, so be sure to pay close attention to the information that amazon does supply. You just have to read it for yourself. I want this movie in english sooooo bad!"
2,"No English Sound Track, ONLY SUBTITLES",Don't buy this movies unless you want to spend the entire movie watching the subtitles and not the beautiful cinematography.
2,Yikes! What a waste of 2 hours of my life!,"Was this a fantasy movie, or a drama about the Spanish Civil War? The fantasy portion of the movie was pretty good, but the sadistic fascists vs the noble revolutionaries part really sucked. Talk about stereotypical bad guys and good guys. Absolutely no character depth or meaningful plot here. And in case the producers/writers decide to make another film like this, they might do with a history refresher and not have the Spanish civil war last until 1945, when it ended in 39."
2,don't like it,"This is a morbid and pretentious film. A fairy tale that champions brutality under the guise of condemning it.I can understand del Toro has no love for the Phalange, but to cloak his politics into a morbid tale serves (at least as far as this reviewer is concerned) no purpose.i give him an extra star for sound effects, tho'. And for the sheer eeriness and unpleasantness of the film."
2,gratuitus and predictable,"As a lover of fantasy, I was disappointed in Pan's Labyrinth. The faun wasn't a faun but a cross between a faun and a minataur. No faun-like revelling here.Great special effects if you like to see graphic violence.Completely predictable plot. Of course you MUST believe in life after death to be able to consider it remotely worth the uncomfortableness of watching this movie."
1,Bleak Horror Story Masquerading As Fairy Tale,"After reading the rave reviews this film received, I was eager to see this fantasy film. What a waste of two hours. Instead of watching an inspired fable, I was subjected to scenes of graphic beatings, tortures, and shootings. This was not a dark fantasy with realistic war elements; it was a brutal story of inhumanity with small doses of fantasy thrown into the mix.I'm no prude - I can stomach violence and gore if it serves the overall story. In this case, I could find little to redeem the explicit violence and bleak storyline.Not recommended."
1,Surprisingly bad,"I freely admit that I must be missing something in this film. Really wanted to like it, but I couldn't draw much out of it. There wasn't enough fantasy and the real-world scenes were heavy-handed. Nothing epic about another cliche story of good revolutionaries versus bad facists."
3,Violent,"The story is wonderful, but I felt the amount of violence for violence sake was a bit much.It is hard to measure a forign film. One does not know the psyche of the country presenting the film."
3,can somebody pass the bottle please?,"i need a drink...yeah that scene was horrendous and way too brutal. it takes a lot to make me say ""oh my god!"". even i was squirming. be forewarned. that scene almost killed it for me. there was too much reality and not enough fantasy. also, wasn't expecting the subtitles. this movie was definitely a grim tragedy. great sets in the fantasy, but i will think twice before seeing another R rated film. do your research ahead of time before subjecting yourself. the media should really be ashamed of itself for not accurately portraying this movie for what it is. not enough fantasy, to warrant the label ""fairy tale for adults""!"
4,Chillingly Great!,"While I had visions of a childhood fairy tale, this movie is anything but suitable for children. This is the story of Pan's Labyrinth and is meant for a mature audience. The film is violent but not overly so and it truly adds to the feel of the movie without being grotesque. The film itself is fantastic, engaging, and suspenseful. Highly recommended for fans of foreign films, award winners, and fantasy."
5,Love this movie,"I really enjoyed watching this movie on DVD and viewing the special features. I loved the film when I saw it in theater, and it was definitely one I'm glad I now own."
5,Great Movie,Not for kids. Yes it's dark. It is also very good. A few very graphic images are not for everyone. It is a dose of reality for the time period it was done in. The Movie kept me focused on the story line. It is no Spiderman but you walk away with deeper items to think about.
5,Best of 07,"Brilliant! Pan's Labyrinth was my favorite film of 2007. I've been a fan of the director, Guillermo del Toro, since he blew my mind with Blade II. But that film nor his flawed but good follow-up, Hellboy, did not prepare me for the sheer excellence of this film. Visually stunning and emotionally devastating, del Toro has set a new high-water mark for himself and fairy-tale films here. The performances also transcend the language-barrier, especially the brutal and chilling Captain. The film is too intense for young viewers, but I think a new generation will grow into this film and continue to find new layers of it as they grow older. Movies this transcendent are rare, so don't miss this one."
5,Fantasy Verses Reality,"Bravo!! A well done movie! This is an excellent movie and I would highly recommend it.... Although, I wouldn't recommend this movie for children. It is for ADULTS ONLY due to the content of the film.You can read the description of this movie's storyline above, so won't rehash it here. I will however share my impressions of the movie below: The cinematography is brilliant & so was the computer graphics in this movie. I also enjoyed the acting and storyline of this movie as well. It was all so captivating. I found myself wanting to know how the story was going to unfold/end. No Hollywood ending here. This movie is anything but predictable, which is quite refreshing!"
5,Just amazing,"I've seen this about four times now and it still has more to offer with each viewing. It's just a beautifully made, emotional film that, when it ends, leaves me somewhere between a smile and tears so I never quite know what to do. I just love everything about it- the acting, the visuals, the story, and the fact that it's nothing like the BS modern-day fairy tales you usually see. Buy it and watch it... several times. I can't say anything about the bonus features on the DVD because I haven't watched them yet, but I hear they're pretty cool."
5,Fantastic,"Guillermo Del Torro outdid himself in this movie.The speacial effects were incredible as well as the plot line, it's like going back to when there were actually good movies. Such as, labrynth, and legend...it was winner of three academy awards and it totally deserved it!Pan's Labrynth draws you into it's complex universe from the beginning, sweeping us along for a story that dazzles, frighten and moves. It is falmmaking at it's most visionary and disciplines, and with Del Torro moves to the fron ranks of world cinema.This film is set against the historical backdrop of the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939). His extravagant imagination and his abiding interest in Spanish Civil War and the dangers of ideology. Tracing the fate of an innocent little girl in a landscape of man-made evil."
5,Simply beautiful; violence portrayed truthfully; heartstopping music,"It was quite a shock at the theatre, having thought it a children's movie from the poster. It was also one of the best movies I had seen in a long time. It portrays violence truthfully; while there's probably less scenes of violence than 5 minutes of Tarantino films, visceral fear and agony come thru in a way those empty films never could. The beautiful scenes of survival and hope, goodness, and haunting echos of humanity stay in your mind months after having seen the movie. Oh, and the music - it's so beautiful and wrenching in its portrayal of the princess amidst the terrible misery of those who would prevent her from returning to her true home."
3,Good Production... But what story telling ?,"I bought this DVD sight unseen. I love good story telling, specifically when there is some imagination involved. Sadly this movie is just ok.The fantastical storyline is dissapointing and unfulfilled in my opinion. The real life story is repetitive and pedestrian. The large part of the real life story is simply one man executing others with a pistol. I think that happened like 10 times through the movie. It just got boring and almost laughable. You could almost create a drinking game from it. Everytime someone gets executed with a pistol DRINK!That being said the acting was good. The visuals were well done too.This movie definately suffers from too much hype. There is no comparison between this movie and The Lord of the Rings."
3,Loved it ... and hated it,"I won't bore you with a repetition of what has been said many times in previous reviews, but I will reiterate the observation that this is really, in many ways, two separate movies.One is a dark, brooding, mysterious and excellent allegory about good and evil, innocence between corrupted by (or at any rate confused and beguiled by) evil. I was fascinated by this portion of the film, with its superb characterizations, acting and special effects.The other movie is a brutal, sadistic and overly graphic depiction of torture and killing. To linger almost lovingly over these scenes is NOT my idea of good movie making. A good film maker can deliver the same impact without the gore. This is the part of the film I hated. Unfortunately, it ruined the total effect for me and, frankly, I would never recommend this movie to anyone."
2,Disappointed,I was completely disappointed with Pan's Labyrinth. I found it extremely slow and disjointed. More hype than substance. Hardly a masterpiece.
1,"English, Please!",The reviews were great but no where did I find any idea that my DVD would be in Spanish. I thought perhaps someone made a mistake and put it on Spanish until I went to the menu and tried to change it to English but the only English availabe was the subtitles. Either someone made a mistake in packing or this should have been advertised as being in Spanish with English subtitles. Special effects were great but not everyone could keep up with the subtitles and do not like spending time trying to read and miss action in the movie. I only gave it a 1 rating because of this.
1,Language is Spanish,Sure could have been better explained. I would never have bought it had I known.
2,How I Dislike Subtitles,"The movie would have been great, if it was in English... I hate subtitles. It detracts from the essence of the plot. And it was in Spanish - a second boo-ha-ha."
2,Not that good.,"I watched this movie expecting to be blown away based on all of the 5 stars and award nominations that it is getting and I was very disappointed. It's an average movie that, while good, is not the wonderful thing that I expected. Based on all of the raves of it's ""fantasy"" nature, I expected a lot more of that side of the story. Unfortunately, the fantasy was sadly lacking. I don't want to put in a spoiler, but I will say that I definitely hated the ending. I was ok with the rest of the movie and would have given it 3 stars except that the ending knocked it down to 2 stars.Also, the DVD quality is lacking - the English subtitles stopped appearing around scene 18 and it took a bit of button pressing to get them to show again. And the directors commentary cut out around scene 19 and I again had to do a bit of button pressing to get it back.And am I the only one that was annoyed with the amount of scene transitions that the director put in? It got to be very monotonous."
1,YIKES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I knew from the start it was going to be dark. But not only was it dark it was really sadistic. The ""rabbit"" scene was so horrible that I really don't think I've ever scene anything that bad. To think this is a ""fairy tale"". I don't know who would tell this even to an adult as a fairy tale. And as Mr. Guillermo says a night time story. Yeah, if you want someone to die of a heart attack or have life long nightmares. I'd hate to see what he calls a horror story. Sorry I even had to give it one star. I give it -*****."
1,Just Say No!,"A primary purpose of reviews is to help others decide whether or not to buy a product. By all accounts, this is a dark, cruel, violent movie. Isn't there enough violence in our world without seeking to immerse ourselves in more, and calling it ""entertainment?"" Beware! Your eyes are the windows to your soul. Those who think they can participate in such violence (yes, viewing ""IS"" participating) without being negatively influenced by it are living in a TRUE fantasy world. Please, do yourself and the rest of humanity a favor: When it comes to such ""entertainment,"" just say no! Thank you."
1,scaring brutal,"I never need to see this movie again. It looks lovely, but it is beyond brutal and scaring. I'd rather watch Schindler's List again. All of the lovely beauty and fantasy is ruined by the excessive violence. This is NOT a fantasy film it's a war movie with creepy dream sequences.Try Ledgend, Labyrinth, or Mirror Mask for better fantasy with a similar look.For better war films try Bridge Over the River Kwai, Das Boot (subtitles), Mash, Glory, Midnight Clear, and Lawrence of Arabia. My navy seal father-in-law liked Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket, and Letters From Iwa Jima (subtitles)."
4,Labyrinth???,"I have to say, wasn't that bad of a movie? But the name ""Pan's Labyrinth...""?? What exactly does a Labyrinth have to do with this movie...I'm thinking..oh ok, this movie is gonna revolve around a trip thru a labyrinth...should be a very exciting journey to be taken on for a litle while..First thing that actually comes to mind is...The Labyrinth w/ Jennifer Connelly and David Bowie. Anyways...has nothing to do a labyrinth at all. I just think a movie title should at least describe what the movie ""is"" about and not what it isn't about!! A title of maybe ""the sorry father"" would have been better...hahaha..."
3,Not as echanting as I expected it to be,"After all the rave reviews I expected this movie to be really extraordinary, and I was disappointed. I'm not saying that it's a BAD movie - it isn't - only that it fell short of my expectations. Why? For several reasons. First, the story was intentionally derivative of many other myths and movies.The idea of juxtaposing the ugly reality of Fascist Spain with a fantasy world was somewhat original, but overall the movie had a ""been there, seen that"" feel to it. The acting is excellent, but production values verge on cheesy: grainy, dark, day-for-night shots, etc. A lot like the cheap movies Elvira used to host on the midnight movies of long ago. And the first half of the movie moves VERY slowly. So, while I found ""Pan's Labyrinth"" interesting, I'd rank it as only slightly above average overall."
3,WARNING!,"I already owned this movie on DVD, and I bought the Blu-ray because Amazon states that it has English Dubing. There is NO English DUB on the Blu-ray. I'm just warning people like me that hate reading sub-titles. If I'm reading, I'm not watching (and this is a movie worth watching). If I have to read, I'd rather read a book."
2,Humorless War Film,"If you're looking for a dark fantasy or horror film, you'll have to look elsewhere--""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a humorless war film marketed as a dark fairy tale. When the director pulls the rug out from under the viewer at the end of the movie, people literally walked out of the movie booing. It's quite literally the biggest disappointment since ""The Village"". If you're into movies like ""Schindler's List"" or ""Saving Private Ryan,"" however, you might enjoy this film."
3,"like it , too violent","I liked the visuals and the meaning of the story in general but too much violent for me , i wouldn't recommend it for Youngers ."
2,Not for children or adults young at heart. For cynics.,"I was disappointed in the movie. The hype, and trailers made it into a fantasy, comparable with Lord of the Rings. It does not remotely come close. The movie, is how the big bad captain, maltreats everyone in his family. He is also a terrible sadist, fighting the republican partisans still in the hills. This all happens years after the Civil war ended in Spain. The Captain is a caricature of a cold, brutal, sadist. Clearly, you see the bias of the film, if you pay attention. The big problem is that the depiction is one sided. The Republicans had terrible atrocities on their side as well. This is a war movie, war movie with a fantasy side story. This flick was bloody, humourless, biased and a real bummer with small sprinklings of fantasy. The acting was good, script was bad, and the plot was a failure. This movie is not for kids, or adults who are kids at heart."
1,DVD Quality Issues,"Note: This is not a review of the movie, but the DVD Release.One would think that as long as DVD has been out, issues with encoding would all be sorted out. Not so here, the last 25% of this movie is basically unwatchable (seriously) due to motion artifacting. Most people won't see this due to their DVD player doing automatch deinterlacing. (I use a seperate video processor)I believe the movie was half encoded in standard film (24fps progressive) DVD transfer and half as 30fps interlaced. Even if you don't notice the INT combing, your losing lots of video quality for the most important parts of the film.DON'T BUY THIS DVD"
4,Wish it wasn't in spanish,I really liked the movie except the part where it was in Spanish and you had to use subtitles to know what they were saying.
5,Excellent!!!,This is an excellent movie with very strong characters! If I lived in that time I too would've had to create an imaginary world just to cope with the harsh reality around me! This is a gem!
3,"Well done, but graphic",Just bought this movie. It is very graphic and doesn't have as much fantasy as the previews eluded. I wish they did more in the labyrinth.
5,PURE PERFECTION,"this is everything the devils backbone wanted to be.while that movie had the feel of that period,it wasnt a horror movie at all.what it was was a look at a great director,storyteller in the making.the departed won the big awards but it wasnt the best movie.i cant see giving a redo (as great as the departed was/is) such high acclaim when theres such an original movie just as good.del toro got robbed.case closed.we all know what the story is about and its a hard sell in hollywood in the sense of it being accepted (not the most child-friendly telling of a childs fantasy,is it) so i wont rehash.del toro or his reps....GET IN THE DIRECTORS CHAIR SOON !!!!!(no more ''backbone's'' though,ok?????)"
4,Truly an awesome film,"I really like the film very much. Very much in awe of it all and i've watched it more than once so far. The down side is the subtitles..thats the only thing, however, with all the special effects you forget the subtitles...just wish it was dub in english i would have gave it a five. But, of all films of 2006, this film is a true must to any DVD collection. Highly Recommended!!!"
5,Pan's Labyrinth,Stunning - one of the best movies of a year of great movies. I adore Guillermo del Torro
5,A DVD full of details that make up a beautiful film.,"I feel sorry for the folks who automatically hate a foreign language film. These are usually the same people who rent Widescreen Edition DVDs and return them to the video store and complain about the black bars at the top and bottom of their TV screen. But I digress. Pan's Labyrinth is such a great movie that even if the amount of sub titles doubled I wouldn't change my mind. The featurettes on this DVD are fascinating. Del Toro's notebook for the film is included and is, alone, worth the $$ just to see how this guy dreamt it all up. I have a hard time imagining Del Toro topping this work."
5,NOT A KIDS MOVIE,"4#$208 in other wordsWhen we were in London there was a line to see this film, but when we found out it was in another language and subtitled in English we let it pass. Later we saw it on at a local Texas theater. We had forgotten it was in Spanish.When it started I was ready to leave till my wife convinced me (she refused to get up) to stay.It was a very good movie and I'm glad we watched it.One day I was listening to a commentator on WBAP radio who said it was a very good ""childrens movie"" that ""children of all ages would enjoy. HEADS UP THIS IS NOT FOR KIDS.I don't see this as a movie worthy of multiple viewings, however I do feel it's worth it's price."
3,Adults Only,"I like when a movie is advertised for what it is actually about. I don't like gory war movies made to look like they are a fantasy movie. Although this movie is good, the ads made it look like another fantasy movie. I am giving it three stars because of the poor job of promoting the movie. Be warned it is more like ""Photographing Fairies"" than a childrens movie. I happen to like this type of movie, but I felt this was a touch more brutal than necessary. I like the Grimm fairy tales, but that doesn't mean I need to see the gore in my face to enjoy movies of them. This is rated R so that should be your first clue. The fantasy story sprinkled in amongst the horror did not appeal to the side of me that enjoys movies like ""Princess Bride"" and ""Labyrinth"". Although the story is good I don't think you need to slice someones mouth with a razor blade and brutally beat people to make it's point."
4,Different,"I gotta say that when I first watched this movie, I was taken aback. The previews led you to believe that the movie was a majority if fantasy, but in reality, it was more about a war. Very brutal scenes, so NOT a kid movie. It did, however have a great plotline and graphics."
4,From cruel reality to othwerworldly menace,"Del Toro has accomplished something quite original in the narrative framework of the fairy tale. I was impressed by this film's depiction of the brutality of postwar Spain, a topic that this Mexican filmmaker seems more comfortable exploring than most Spaniards are. My only complaint is that the film focused on too much harsh realism and hardly enough fantasy. A more even mix of the two would have made the film's narrative and themes seem more balanced, especially considering how extraordinary the fantasy visuals were."
2,Cinematagraphy nice,"Beautiful in high def, the movie was pretty cool; however, just not as imaginary as I would have thought. This review probably is a little harsher due to not meeting expectations. It was a good movie and was more to the point of the one girl's struggle in her situation rather than the 'fiction' and fantasy of her escape. The escape sequences (her imagination) were a little hoaky."
5,The best film of 2006! An inspired DVD edition!,"In my opinion, the best of 2006. Del Toro's blending of brutal reality and terrifying but redemptive imagination was by far the most original, fascinating, best crafted, and profoundly moving film of the year. And this DVD is just chock-full of features that will deepen your understanding of the director's purposes in making this beautiful film."
5,Great Movie,"The movie itself was very good. It is a very dark fairytale. I enjoyed it very much. As far as the blu-ray PQ, it looked superb. I reccomend you watch this."
4,"a beautiful film, excellent acting","This was a fairytale for adults, but not in the way most would probably think. The ""R"" rating came from some scences of graphic violence and language.I think the best films are made from common and simple themes that have been known for a very long time. What makes this film great is that it told a story in a very creative yet simple way and sent a message which has been given in countless films before it. The message I got out of it was that this is a very cruel and unforgiving world. The main character in the film, Ofelia invented her own reality in order to escape from the cruel world around us. In the end, did her ""invention"" benefit just her or anyone else as well?"
5,"A bit mature for the younger audience, but a good story nonetheless","I have this on standard DVD format and will probably get it on Blu-Ray as well. The movie is a bit long for a non speaking Spanish person, like me, but all and all, it is a good movie. I do believe it is a bit mature for the younger audience, even though the story circles around a young child. It is probably a good idea not to let the young watch the movie just yet. Wait until they can get a since of what is real and what isn't. This movie can certainly give nightmares to a small child. However, on the other hand, it is a good movie if you want to learn Spanish. I rate this movie to be a 5 for the story, but rate it low because it will not support the young children."
1,BORING AND VERY CORNY!,THE MOVIE HAS A COUPLE GOOD SCENES. 95% OF THE MOVIE IS CORNY AND BORING AND A WASTE OF TIME.
3,OVERRATED,"This movie was just ok. Maybe I got started wrong because I didn't know the movie was sub-titled. For somebody who reads a lot, I didn't like the idea of going to the theater to learn I'd have to read for 2 hours. The other part that disappointed me was the comparison to Lord of the Rings. No way. Not even close. I'm surprised this movie is being considered for Oscars."
1,hell raisor meets fairy tale world,i really dont understand all the five star ratings for this movie. I think the main charater was very crazy and altough it may be justified because of all her tramatic experences her fantasies are totally demented. The preview looked like something disney put out but the movie is absoulutely not for children. If you like sacrificial offerings to demons and an inconsistant story line check this one out otherwise you may as well watch a diffrent 1 star movie in english.
2,Overhyped,"I was truly disappointed after watching this film. Del Toro is a master storyteller, but there was no sense of urgency here, hence the film dragged on, rather than flowed. I also have to say that graphic violence in this film didn't belong. We already know, you're going to kill a man, so why do we need to see it in graphic, bloody detail? That was another thing that took away from the movie. I felt as if I was watching Apocalypto all over again, dreading extreme violence at every turn. I am sure, I would've liked the film more, had it not had all this blood, and had it been faster paced. Hopefully, Del Toro's next film will be up there with Blade II."
3,The reg DVD is better - no good extras,"The picture is better, but this has nothing really in the way of extras. If you have the original DVD just stay with that."
4,SubTitled,"I enjoyed the movie very much and would have given it 5 Stars, but like the movie it self, it is sub-titled. Too me this takes a lot away from the movie, I'm a slow reader, trying too keep up with the dialouge. I wish that they could have put an english track on it for me. Other than that, It's a great movie!"
3,Great Fairy Tale too much on screen torture,"The this is a movie about how fairy tales used to be, and that part is fantastic. My issue with this movie was the the horrific torture and sadism of the captain. Had this been toned down I could have dealt with it, and I admit I understand that in real wars folks do awful things to each other but I don't have to reward the filming of this behavior with my hard earned cash. You can horrify the audience without resorting to on screen horror. It seems that some of us have become numb to mans inhumanity and this movie is another example of it. Thus I won't be buying a copy of this for the home collection."
3,excellent film - but children and sensitve adults beware,"Pan's Labyrinth is the essence of fairy tale fantasy and real-world horror. Please be warned that this film is, in my opinion, NOT for children or anyone who is sensitive to graphic torture/violence. I found the 'fantasy' sequences to be very interesting and at times entertaining, however, the real-life scenes involving the 'Capitan' and his actions are highly disturbing. If you decide to buy this film, please watch it first before exposing it to your children."
3,Hard to Please,"The 2 CD package seemed fine to me, however it was a gift for a student of my English Language class. He opened it and immediatly wasn't happy as this set does did not include the ""souviner key"" to the ""Labyrinth"". So we are still looking. Apparently, out there somwhere, there is a special series that includes the directors notes and ""The Key"". The lastest info is it's only available in Korea??"
3,NOT in English?!?!?!?!!?,"what a rip off, I Loved this movie in the theater and wanted to share it with my slow reading friends but NOOOO they didn't dub it in English! why not? i'm sening it back, what a crock. why buy it if you can't watch it with Loved ones?"
2,"Might be good, but I will never know!","I purchased this DVD because my husband wanted to see it. We put the movie in the DVD player, and there were subtitles on the screen. I thought at first that this was only going to be at the beginning of the movie. I don't know about anyone else, but when I want to read a book, I buy a book. Anyway, we were both disappointed that this movie was only available in Spanish, and we have stubbornly refused to put the movie on again as we were so disappointed. I don't want to watch a movie that I have to read and lose some of it in translation... I tried to return it to the store we bought it from but they of course refused as it was already opened... I feel that I was misled by the packaging (all in English) and would love a refund!!!"
2,I don't get it,"Would the movie critics out there please STOP with the gushing reviews of a movie that makes no sense. If it makes no sense, do not assume that it must be really deep and meaningful - maybe it JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. OK, so she is some kind of princess - cool - how does that benefit her or make any difference in the story? She needs to complete three tasks - she messes one up - BTW what the hell was that thing? Some tiny hint or explanation about it and the food might have been nice. - BUT, she gets another chance - good for her. The rebels, the general, the maid, the brother - no clue what the heck any of it had to do with anything -The faun was cool - that does not make a good movie - really disappointing - shame on the critics and the academy - call it like it is - a confusing disjointed mess"
2,Doesn't live up to it's hype!!!!,This can't possibly be compared to Lord of the Rings. I'll give it some credit for making such a visually attractive movie with a dull story line. Even Narnia is better than this. I hate the fact that it is all in Spanish and the DVD cover doesn't make it very apparent at all. Don't let you kids watch it because my wife could hardley stand the brutality of the psycho dad in the movie.
2,Am I the only one who HATED IT?,This was the first movie I walked out of in years!!! It is wonderfully creative but it is so painfully hopeless. I just couldn't stomach it. Let's just say it is not a feel good movie.
3,Way over rated,"I like historical fiction, and enjoyed the ""real world"" part set in the Spanish Civil War. Very brutal (for me a negative), but still interesting. The fantasy parts were mediocre. Some of the concepts were interesting, but the monsters were pathetic. I called over my kids so they could laugh at the Pale Man. Boy, he was scary, and real fast and muscular. LOL. The reason he eats very young children is slightly older kids would simply out run him, or even beat him up. What a wuss monster, it reminds me of some from the worst Sci Fi monsters, like Robot Monster.Maybe I didn't like the movie as much because I had high expectations, and this is mediocre. Had I expected it to be dreadful, maybe I would have liked it more."
3,violence and fairy tales.......,"As you probably know, this movie is like 2 movie, a kinda dark fairy tale, anda very dark war story, with its dark characters.. The darkness and violencefrom one destroys the other. i viewed this movie, i admired the very nicephotography and effects of the fairy tale portion, which was slowly destroyedby the other story. Even if everyone loves this movie, i shall never view itagain,and shall not buy it....why...the world is dark enough, and i dont feeli have to be reminded with dark war characters, the world has enough of them."
3,buyer beware,"I chose this heading for my review because I originally ordered a copy from a dealer for my daughter as a gift and I never received the product. So I ordered a slightly more expensive copy directly from AMAZON with second day shipping to get the gift on time. Sometimes this is just the way to go, even if you have to spend a couple more dollars to insure that you will receive your order and it will be shipped promptly and properly.I unfortunately can not be much help with a review of the movie for I have not seen it yet. My Daughter did however say it was an entertaining picture although it has subtitles."
2,Don't Like Language.,This movie is listed in English format in all its adds. But it is actually Spanish and you have to read the subtitles in English.This should not be listed this way.
5,Outstanding,"Pan's Labyrinth is a fantastic film that is thought provoking throughout. The film is set in 1940's Spain and fluently switches between reality and fantasy in a way that makes the viewer's imagination run wild. The viewer's imagination is stimulated in the first scene where Ofelia's blood draws back into her nose. Is this the future of Ofelia or is this just her fantasy of what she imagined? It is not a children's movie, but it is a fasinating movie about many aspects of life. A must see for all!"
4,"Good, but definitely not for children!","I loved the movie, especially Ophelia's fantasy world. Her stepfather's killings, however, were pretty brutal. There are several instances where I cringed from the brutality. The subtitles are well translated, making it easy for an English speaker to watch it."
5,Imagination beyond...,Loved this movie! Totally interesting and imaginative perception on the journey of souls. i loved how the incorporated fiction with non-fiction as far as the Spanish War setting. Guillermo out did himself with this one!
4,Mace Windu..... Jedi Master,This is a great action figure. The cloak come off and his arm and hand twist. My mom bought this action figure for my 5 year old brother. My mom also bought Kui-Adi Mundu. He loves both of them !
4,"Portrays character very well with good likeness, well made!!","Jedi Master Mace Windu. Highly respected Jedi Council Member seems to be regarded as second only to Master Yoda. With the new COMMTECH chip technology, you can hear him speak phrases from the movie!!! I highly recommend this toy!!!"
4,Mace Windu - the good and bad pionts,Mace Windu the action figure is a good toy to add to a Star Wars Episode One collection. I like how his cloak comes on and off and the detail of his clothes. His light saber is one like no other. Its very unique.The bad points of this toy are the fact that when I first got it the arm fell off. Also the light saber is very fragile so I wouldn't recommend it for really rough play.
3,OK- but not durable or extreme,"We have tried a couple different dog booties for our two Bichons. We bought our first pair of these at Petco and liked them enough to order another- unfortunately we ordered them too soon- as the first pair wore through by the time the second pair arrived! They do the job to protect our boys' paws from salt, but the nylon shell wore through inside of a week so they are definitely not weather proof... Their little paws wind up wet anyway so we no longer bother to put these on them if it is just raining. If it is muddy, it would offer some protection from dirt-but I would not recommend these (or call them all weather) except for the fact that they seem to be the best available... I was not expecting Nike quality but I would hope something marketed as ""extreme all weather"" could hold up to 5 minutes of use a few times a day for more than a few low intensity potty breaks- it's not like we took the dogs camping or hiking or anything!"
2,Flies off corgis,"They are useless for my corgis, the fly off with the first paw flip. Since one of my corgis is extremely sensitive to salt, I am pretty disappointed with them and am on Amazon looking for something that will really work. I've had them for a few years and never used them since they don't stay on the dog. A few day ago one got a bad paw cut so I used one over a bandage and it stayed on, but now I have the bandage off and it flies right off."
1,Don't buy these!! Keep looking!!,"I bought these boots for my seven-month-old pitbull-terrier. It's winter time right now, so the ground is cold, wet, and people put out rock salt to melt the ice. I take my dog Jefferson out for walks and also jogging.After the 10-minute walk, I took the boots off and the red lining was falling apart on his paw. Also, his paws were wet--and wet equals cold. The packaging says, ""keeps paws warm and dry."" It does not keep paws warm and dry if your dog's paws are getting wet. I'm gonna keep looking for something better."
2,poor exchange policy,"For the price, I suppose these small boots would have been OK, although I doubt they could handle extreme conditions.The small boots were WAY too large for my medium size Boston Terrier. The company was slow to respond to my exchange request, and their policies were so ridiculous that the cost of the boots would have tripled by the time an exchange was made. I would not use them again."
1,Comes in big sizes and the seller is not cooperative w/ returns/exchanges,"I got this for my dog and though I got a ""small"" size it was still too big for my dog (it looked like a large) so I contacted the seller if I can make an exchange and they were not cooperative at all. Bad business practice. Will never buy from this seller again."
2,"Interesting, but disappointing","""Group"" just didn't cut it for me. The concept was terrific. I couldn't wait to read the book. But I found the author's writing uninspiring. and the people's stories just weren't all THAT fasinating. Several of them suffered from drug and alcohol problems so what they had to say was almost predictable, especially if you've ever been to an AA meeting. I WAS surprised by the shrink. He seemed to keep the group under control and moving forward. I actually thought he earned his fee. That HE turned out to be a drunk was stunning, especially since neither the author nor the self absorbed participants gave any indication they cared two hoots for him."
3,Mixed Bag,"I had mixed feelings about this book. I felt a little cheated when I found out the group was hand-picked by the therapist who seemed to equate being very rich (or attaching to the very rich) with being special.Having said that, I still enjoyed listening in to the sessions (as I would with any group) and being reminded of how we engage in what the therapist calls suffering conversions to avoid our pain."
4,Park Day,Park Day was an excellent movie...It kept me interested the while time. It kept me wondering what's going to happen next.
4,Park Day,Interesting movie about something we do not hear about much. Harper and Calhoun give good performances. It kind of drags a little. 4/5
1,hot.........garbage!,"[...]Hill Harper should stick to playing wannabe, halfway thugs named Breezy T in movies where LL Cool J calls himself God.This was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life.Total and Complete GARBAGE!!!"
2,Material mostly covered in previous work.,This book was not nearly as compelling as previous outings. It'd be nice if he'd write about another subject other than Vietnam for a change. I don't know how he would market that one which is why we probably won't see it. Shields needs to break some new ground in his work. As a longtime reader I am growing bored. This book bored me.
5,Very Handsome Bible!,"This Bible is very beautifully bound (nice red leather)and has a lot of cool extras. I was not familiar with the ""Holman Standard Bible"" before...it is written in layman's terms and is very easy to understand. However, if you are wanting an original translation like the King James Version than this Bible should probably be a supplemental Bible rather than your mainstay. Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase and the Bible is much better looking then the picture portrays. My husband, who is a firefighter, is really enjoying it."
3,the firefighters bible,it had writing on the inside page which i had to tear out before i gave it to my grandson.
5,Buy this for the Firefigher in your life.,Chose this for my son who is a Firefighter and EMT for Christmas. He has been dealing with the terminal illness of another F/F in his house as well as several really difficult medical calls. He was thrilled to get the bible and found the recommended passages in the back a great resource. He carries it in his station bag so it's always handy for reference and to loan to anyone.
3,Little articulation but good detail,"I'm not a hardcore collector of these figures; I prefer to pose them for shots of an action-figure based comic strip I do. The detail on Valorum is very good, although I was disappointed in how his articulation is limited - there are no knee, elbow, or wrist joints."
2,quick strut review,"I ordered the strut on 10/9, it arrived on 10/19 and It was in a taped up box and there was no paperwork in the box and no new nuts for the struts, It appeared to be an unit that had been open or used before. I installed the strut and it worked OK."
2,It works I guess,"This quick strut definitely made the job of replacing the struts on my car much quicker and easier but after less than a year the car rides the same as it did before!If I could go back and make the choice again, I would just buy seperate components that I know are good quality components. It costs more money than these struts that's for sure, but at least you have a good ride when you are done."
2,Not what I expected,I was not impressed with this book. There are a lot of resturants that I have never heard of before and it was not user friendly.
2,Shop Around!,"After not doing my homework, I just paid $4.50 each for 4 mini-whisks which have a MSPR is .89 cents. The shipping was $6.61 and came in just a padded envelope via the USPS. ($2.00?). I really thought they would be better quality than the rusty ones I have now. They were not. I paid $24.61 the buy $3.56 worth of product and to have it sent to me. Shame on me. At the end of the day, it was really my fault. Google search is now my best friend - not Amazon's search.Fox Run Mini Whisk"
3,light weight,"Not as heavy of weight as one I already own but not too flimsy, can beat one egg or some choc milk. I was a little disappointed as I looked all over for these and only found them on Amazon website and didn't think to check the weight of the steel."
3,Magnetic Chess Set,Hi.. I purchased the magnetic chess set. The game itself is very educational and helpful for kids.The piece was not that great as the magnets would slip from the bottom of the pieces themselves.I would definately recommend the game but advise the vendor to use better glue
3,Great ingredients,"Kiss My Face is one of the few brands of products that don't irritate my skin. I've been using their moisture soap for about five years now. However, I have only used the Pear scent up until I tried this Peach scent. The scent itself was pleasant but the soap was so much thinner (almost runny) compared to the Pear scent."
3,Just okay.....,Once the electrical cord is wound on to the holder it gets a little cumbersome and awkward. I would not purchase this item again.
5,Just what I had been searching for,"I'm 6'3 and 180# and I have to say that these are extremely comfortable and fit very well. I bought the Medium and they do run a bit tighter than expected, even for my 32"" waist. I do have larger legs but I did not have to adjust them and they always covered my knee, which is why I purchased them for balancing poses like crow. The wicking material works wonderful and the stretchy waist is very comfortable. Good job Verve!"
4,Perfect length and feel,"These are great pants, perfect length and feel to them. Only slight problem is they don't hug as well as they could at the waste so as not to come down. But otherwise great"
2,too small,the material is quite comfortable and the design and lenght is awesome. the only drawback is that it is way too small for a medium. that is a big problem because it blocks the blood circulation to the hips
5,Verve-tastic,"These are great yoga pants. Granted I may have only owned one pair of yoga pants in my life I'm still glad I went with these. After exploring exploring the verve website I was fine with spending the extra cash on a quality product. It's nice to know that they were made here in the USA, and not somewhere hundreds of miles from here. They fit excellent, and I don't find them too tight in any area. Talk about comfy."
3,Best yoga pants,"I own several pairs of yoga pants. I am a yoga teacher and have tried them all. These are the best by far, but the price is absurd."
4,Indoor Drum Ceiling Light,"I spent a lot of time trying to find a deco 1940's era drum light. There are not a lot of choices out there. I initially bought one from Home Depot, but it had plain glass on the bottom, so you could see the lights and fixture through the bottom, which looked ugly.With this fixture you can still see the inside, but not completely. It has more refracted light because of the ribbed pattern on the bottom...so it looks good both when on and off.I bought 2 of these fixtures, both for bathrooms, and they look good. Are they as pretty as my vintage drum lights from the 1940s? No, but they are the best I have found new."
1,brittle of a stale pretzel,"Terrible toy. Not the sellers fault though. Haha! It's probably a collector's item, but my kids liked it. It just wasn't durable."
2,One of the more boring Christmas albums I've ever heard,"First, I should say that the vocals on this CD are pretty good. David Cassidy and Shirley Jones don't lack for talent in that regard.The songs and their arrangements, on the other hand, were just plain uninteresting. I'm not the kind of guy who would knock old standards just for being old -- heck, I still love my John Denver Christmas music -- but nothing really stood out on this album."
1,Great album...get the Razor & Tie version,"If you are a fan of those great early Partridge Family albums, then you owe it to yourself to get these, the 1993 Razor & Tie versions and not the recent re-masters of 2000 and 2003. Why? Razor & Tie did not tamper with the sound quality, as a result, Razor & Tie CD's sound like the records you remember. I made the mistake of buying the re-masters thinking they would sound even greater; NOT!"
1,Shockingly bad,"This is, quite possibly, the worst Christmas album of all time. For God's shakes people AOVID!"
5,Partridge Family Christmas Card CD,"Very nice CD, I love it!! Every song on this CD is good and very heartwarming.Received it very quickly, great service."
5,"I have the album, not the CD, but it's groovy","I just bought this album on vinyl. It's great. The arrangements are unique - completely Partridge Family, but just a little bit more sensitive than the pop releases. I love Cassidy's voice and it's also great to hear Shirley solo. This album makes me smile."
5,My Favorite Christmas Album,"""My Christmas card to you"" is one of the best christmas songs I have heard. I wore out two albums and was so happy when my daughter found this CD for me last year. You will love this album I promise.Happy Holidays to All, Sandi"
3,Partridge Family Christmas Card CD,"They may have used session musicians, and it's funny listening to them after watching Ruby & The Rockits, but their music is timeless, and always enjoyable."
5,"Terrific Book on Food, Cooking, Vegetarianism and Health","True, much of the material in this book can be found elsewhere, but Fowler's book packages all the best advice on health and nutrition in a compact, easy to read and assimilate book, accompanied by fun recipes and home remedy dietary advice. His arguments for going vegetarian, even vegan, are persuasive, given that he himself gave up drinking, and lost 100 pounds, when he converted to vegetarianism. His advice on hygiene in the kitchen, and on the horrors of factory raised meats in the U.S., are enough to convert the rest of us. Fowler's no wild-eyed hippie radical, just a no-nonsense, practical, friendly guy who wants to improve your health and your enjoyment of cooking and food."
2,"Eat Right, Now!","The book is entertaining. The writing is fluid. Nothing new is revealed in healthy eating. We've all heard, seen (TV), and read about it so why spend the money on ANOTHER eat healthy book? A great way to reduce - though not a healthy way - is to spend your money on more cookbooks on the subject of healthy eating until there's no money left to purchase food. If you're interested in reading this book check it out at your local library.In all fairness, the book is an entertaining and humerous read and well written."
3,Beware of improvements!,"For years I've used the Calphalon commercial non-stick pans. They get hard use in my kitchen, but perform amazingly well. Clean up time, no matter what I've cooked, is practically non-existent. The only problem is that they need to be replaced every couple of years, as the coating begins to scratch and peel, even with very good care. So I thought the Calphalon One would be the answer. It's not. It is a nice pan, well balanced, well made, etc etc. However, the non-stick surface does not perform anywhere near that of the commercial non-stick. Food sticks and stains pretty easily, and I've found I had to use quite a bit of oil to get good results. Not at all what I wanted, and too expensive to throw away! I'm going to stock up on the commercial non-stick while I still can."
5,Excellant Cookware,This pans are very nice to cook with and clean up easily. I have finally gotten a whole set and they are worth the money.
2,Not as good as expected.,I have had other Calphalon products. This pan tends to get very hot quickly and stays hot. I am burning things. It doesn't seem to be as thick as I was expecting.
2,Disappointment in non-stick performance,This is definitely not a non-stick pan.Very disappointing given the price paid.
1,Another disappointment from Calphalon,"Calphalon states in their website that the so-called infused anodization is not supposed to wear off. After all, it's ""infused."" In fact, they go so far as to say it's ""rare."" It may be rare to them, but I've experienced it twice. The first time, they replaced this pay. Now, it's happened again. When the Calphalon tea kettle began to leak (less than a year old), I decided to be through with Calphalon. It's an expensive mistake. The quality is highly overrated. Workmanship is poor."
4,A good variety,I enjoyed this book. I am a West Tennessee resident and I liked reading the wide variety of poetry from the writers in my area. I feel anyone would enjoy reading this book wherever they are from. I liked it.
3,"This is one ""hefty"" saucepan","A great addition to your Le Creuset collection but be aware, this saucepan is rugged and heavy and requires both hands to manipulate its contents to the end destination."
3,"Not as good as ""Icefire""","Didn't enjoy this one as much as their earlier ""Icefire"". The tech is far out, the situations are unbelievable and the characters exist to only to serve the plot and to get the hots for each other at odd times. Recommended for genre buffs only."
2,Full of feminist horse MANure,"Why have all of the books I've read lately tried SO hard to show strong, emasculating women? I'm really not trying to be nasty, but I can't help wonder about the relationship between the wife-husband (notice the proper placement of the wife) authors of this book. Frankly I don't even like it when authors create male soldiers that are Rambo-esque, but Amy, our plucky, motorcycle riding mid-shipmen (shipwomen?) from the Academy has more moves than Bruce Lee.Although the story is, once again, loaded with cowering males who stick like glue to their resourceful, strongwilled, ninja-trained, death commando female counterparts, I found the plot, about the hijacking of the Pentagon, to be interesting.If the husband, of this wife-husband writing team, would put the pants back on, I think these guys could write a believeable story. The material's not bad, but I'm running out of pantyhose reading their books. Enough, already."
4,Excellent Fast Paced Read!,"This plays much like a Tom Clancy novel without having to wade through pages and pages of technical mumbo jumbo. Very hard to put down once you get into the story and it should grab you early on. About the only thing I could have done without was the romantic innuendo between several of the main characters...this would go over better in a movie but it could've been left out of the book in my opinion. Personally, if my life was on the line and I was trying to survive, how good my cohort's hair smells would probably be the last thing on my mind..."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"After reading and throughly enjoying ICEFIRE, I eagerly awaited QuickSilver. I was somewhat disappointed. This book no way matches the characters, plot, and excitement of Icefire."
1,Not what you get,The battery you get is a 900 mha not 1100 or the 1800 mha shown. But you do get 2 battery s so that must be adding it up?? It's not a good thing when you order one thing and you get something other than that. I would hope Amazon will look into this.
1,not worth the money,"I wouldn't buy this again, it's such a waste of money. One of the batteries I was sent was a used one; the sticker in the back was slightly peeled. This one wouldn't take a charge after a month but was promptly replaced. The 2nd battery quit charging after being left in the charger overnight. I guess these batteries can't be left too long in the charger but how long is too long? I shouldn't have to watch the clock to watch the time needed to fully charge these batteries. I've left the OEM battery in the charger alot longer than overnight and still works without any problems. Buy something better."
2,Long Lasting?,I have found these batteries to be ok but not great. They do not hold a charge like I had hoped. I charged the batteries and loaded both into my Canon digital rebel xt and put it back into my camera backpack. I took it out about 2 weeks later and found that the batteries are only showing about half charge and were fully charged when they were installed in the camera.
4,As advertised!,We needed a replacement battery for my wife's Cannon Rebel digital. So far the product is as advertised. We're not profession photographers but do take quite a few family photo's. The battery keeps a charge and works great so far. We've had it about a month. We would buy agaiin if ever needed.
4,Very fast delivery.,"I read that the voltage was less than noted on the add from other reviewers. When I got the batteries, the voltage is no where to be found. However the batteries are fine and super inexpensive. Very fast delivery."
4,Battery 2 Pack,"I received the batteries, charged them up and went to Country Music Expo. I shot over 300 pictures and they were still going strong."
4,Good Buy,This is a really good buy as the product works great and I have not been disappointed by poor battery life as expected. I even think the new batteries are longer lasting than the original that came with my camera.
4,So good so far.,The batteries work well so far. Not sure on the life yet as I have not used them extensively.
1,Bad purchase - doesn't hold a charge,"The batteries were inexpensive, but you get what you pay for. They don't hold a charge if you leave the camera for a week. I suspect the quality of such cheap batteries is highly variable - but you might get lucky. I definitely wouldn't recommend them. Service from the vendor was good though."
3,"Really cheap, acceptable quality",Frankly when the OEM version is over $40 and these are basically $7.50 a piece (including shipping) I figured this was worth a try. One of the batteries works about as well as an OEM battery the other one was a dud - it won't hold a charge if left sitting on the shelf for a few days and even when its fresh it will only run the camera for about two minutes.
1,900mAh!!!!,"The two batteries I bought are cleary marked ""900mAh"" on the back. I wonder why they are stating these are 1100mAh batteries......"
5,Works Great,"I bought these batteries about 4 months ago. I've used them many times and they both work great, just as well as the Canon battery for a fraction of the price."
4,Good product with a minor flaw,Received the product quickly as usual with Amazon and hooked it up. product worked as advertised and TV picture was clearer and amp sounded better so it does its job for a reasonable price.I would recommend putting a power center/surge protecter in line with expense equipment!Only flaw was the remote and as others have remarked it is worthless. I set it up and it works once if you hold it while standing by the center but may not work at all the next time and you have to reprogram it.Other then that it is a good unit and a good value.
2,Tripp Lite HT 1210isictr,I hooked this thing up and went to turn on the last 4 outlets to find the remote didnt work. I took the battery out and it looked like it had leaked something so I had no remote for the moment and just turned on the switches manually. Everything was working ok for about an hour when one of the lights went out showing the amps. It was now blank. The other issue was there was no dimmer on this thing and it was bright enough to lite up a gymnasium. That was the last straw and I returned it.
1,Lasted one time before it died,"Had this thing for a couple of days. Tried it in the pool but soon noticed I needed a lot more room because of the speed. Took it to Laguna Niguel Lake with my son it died within 5 minutes. Battery still good, motors still good once (tested using an external dc power source) radio communications seems to be the issue.Ask for a refund and was told to return it. Never found the time or effort to send it back. Will probably just trash it once I get tired of seeing it on my work bench."
1,Doesnt work directions inaccurate!,The directions were inaccurate and hard to read.The product worked for five minutes and then stopped.Very disappointed as this was a gift for my godson and it was rather embarrassing that a brand new toy didnt even work.
4,Electric Boat,Processed and delivered as expected. Does what it says. Lasts about 5 minutes before batteries fade!
1,Not a good start,"This item arrived broken and would not work. Luckily the person who received this gift has other romote control items and found the broken solder area and fixed it, otherwise we would have had to return it right away."
1,Terrible experience,"The seller didn't show enough details about this product, and didn't offer full refund. So I had to pay for shipping and return costs because of their deliberate mistakes below:1) Age 14+ (my daughter is 8)2) Don't use in swimming pools3) Don't use in salty waterHorrible shopping experience."
3,Not my first choice...,"OK. If you're like me and just need a Sonic Fix to last until the next Comic installment comes out, then this book is worth it, assuming you find it cheap. But as a landmark book in the Sonic Genre... you're better off making up your own stories or rewatching the Dic Sonic underground DVD's."
1,Very Unpleased with this product!,I had used this product in the past for years. Then I could no longer find it anywhere. Was so happy when I found it on Amazon.com. Ordered the 2 bottles it said was available. Received them and never have I been so dissapointed. This product appears to have been watered down and is not worth two cents. I wasted $19.95! Never will order anything from these vendors again!
5,Great Stuff,One of the best styling liquids I have ever used. After your hair drys you can run a brush through your hair and mist of water and your hair looks great.
4,Vacationland,"The cinematography for this film could have been made much better, however, for the budget I would say that it sufficed more than enough. The story was decent, though, the actor playing the ""str8"" role isn't quite up to par as I thought. Interestingly enough, the actors playing in the movie are hot which is probably the main selling point."
2,Horrible acting... totally low-budget..,"This movie is painful to watch. I love indie films and gay and lesbian films.. but this movie is a shade better than a home movie.. the cinematography is decent, but the acting is terrible and the audio sounds like it was recorded in a bathroom... everyone delivers their lines like they're reading them right off a cue card.. their timing and delivery is horrible... the actors have no life and their on camera presence is lifeless and boring. The dialog seems like it was written halfway and the actors were asked to improvise the rest. As I said before, the poor sound quality would be distracting if there weren't so many other bad things going on. The ""looks"" of the actors are mediocre, so there really isn't eye candy to make up for everything else bad in this movie... definitely not worth wasting money or time on."
2,AN OK MOVIE,Movie had decent looking guys. Not such an interesting story line as they made it out to be.
2,"same old story, borring, poor acting","this is a sad waist of money, move has the same old high school story line and could have been a good move, but it is drawn out and the acting made me sick."
4,victim of rejection,Ken was rejected by his father. I believe this kind of rejection is so damaging it can open one up to the kind of torment he experienced. Being reduced to such helplessness- he became a victim. This book shows what the human spirit can endure. The true character of a person/family/society is revealed in how they treat the dependant and helpless.Even though he attributed his recovery to a drug- I believe his time had come-he had become strong enough to think for himself.The pharmacuetical companies/mental health system is a (big) business. Love heals. If he had been loved in the first place he never would have had to go through what he did-and the same for every suffering person on earth.
1,Error in description,Product is fine but this item is not a 5-pack as described. I ordered expecting 5 bit holders per pack and item came with just one per pack.
2,99 Tahoe,"I purchased the GM-1 T harness to assist in the installation of a viper 560. The size of the harness, its bulk and length, does not provide for an easy installation. Tapping into the factory wiring is just as easy and will save you the price of this product. Data sheets with the location, color, and purpose of each wire needed for installation are located online and open to the public."
5,T Harness,Worked great and saved a significant amount of time on the installation. I would never put a remote starter in without. Price was super and it was on my door step in 3 days. Excellent deal.
2,Just like all the other MOPS books...,"It's okay, just not too original. We tried using it for a small group of moms and it fizzled out pretty quickly."
4,"Pretty good, light reading","This book was pretty good. There were definitely some good ideas in it for enhancing family life and starting traditions. A few of her stories did bring a tear to the eye. Not the best, but worth the read!"
5,Supreme quality for a few cents more,"I've tried Sony, TDK and Memorex minidiscs, and they're all fine, especially for downloading .mp3's or even uncompressed CD type .wav and .pcm files. However, I wouldn't dream of using anything but these professional quality HHB minidiscs for my live music recordings. They're only a quarter or two more expensive per disc, but you know you're getting archival quality. I've never had a failure, and I can't believe the fidelity of live music recorded directly onto this brand of minidisc. Sometimes the recording sounds better than the actual live performance! Give these MD's a try!"
4,I'm sure it was a good idea at the time...,"I kid. I really love this album. This is an ecclectic collection to be sure, but the selections are truly the best of. The versions by the Ventures, the Crickets and the most famous version by Ritchie Valens are great renditions. The more traditions versions by Mariachi Vargas and Conjunto Medellin de Lino Chavez are great. The Rice University Marching Owl Band is excellent. Doo-wop group Big Daddy harmonizes on an exclusive accapella version, which is about the most beautiful thing I have heard in a long time. And the album is rounded out by the song covered by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. Yes, you read that right. The Mormon Tabernacle Choir. This cover of the traditional version of La Bamba is beautiful, majestic and just hilarious."
4,pretty concise and covers enough ground,"Sure, we all have learnt algorithms back in school. We know the fundamentals, we can talk about them, no sweat. But when it comes the time to actually write out an algorithm in C, we all struggle like George W writing SAT. That's why an algorithm book with real useable sample codes is very useful. O'Reilly has a good reputation for pumping out reference books, but there are, inevitably, hits and misses in the series. This volume is a hit. It covers most frequently used everyday algorithms without going into some obscure and generally useless NP-class problems. Full example codes are given on a floopy for easy porting."
3,"Good book, bad code... it could be better...","Hi:Well, this book has a lot of very interesting programming issues, like pointers, recursion, linked lists, stacks & queues, trees, etc, etc...All of these issues are very well explained and have many code examples, but here is the big problem of this book:The comment style of the code examples is ridiculous!!!The author used five lines of code when he could use only one!!!Like this:/*********************** Absurd comment...**********************/This makes slower and really uncomfortable the lecture of the code.Anyway, having this book you'll learn a lot of advanced C programming issues."
2,Probably OK,"The book is probably OK, but there are better, much better ones on the subject. I highly recommend looking at ""The Algorithm Design Manual"", just search Amazon and you'll find it."
5,Stuff I have never seen before!,"I have read a half-dozen or more books pertaining to C Algorithms, and most of them were the same. This touched on the usual stuff - sorting, hashing, linked lists, etc. But it touched on these subjects in ways that are so general purpose that the sample code can be used with little modification! It also adds a couple of new things such as Set algorithms and an explaination of how to pass functions as paramenters to functions.There could have been a few more examples, and he could have explained some of his material in plain english, instead of engineerese.Overall the book is excellent, and I will refer to it often."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A postapocalyptic style story. In the far future, humans are no longer. Cats, dogs etc. have evolved, and are the dominant species on the planet. These aren't your average useless feline, but do have some intelligence.They have legends and mythology, especially of demons e.g. humans. So, of course, some of these come back."
1,"I've had it with ""evil humans, wonderful nature"" sf","When I was in high school, I loved this book. But then, back then, I wrote high school science fiction in which humans were evil and bad, and the Earth was better off without them. That is the whole point of this book. There's nothing at all of any interest in the mutated-Cat culture of the future other than how they deal with the evil Human race that has returned after a looooong absence - only to begin to wreak havoc and devastation yet again.I'm heartily sick of such stories, now that I'm an adult."
1,Who cares about cats? Not me,"I've read other Andre Norton books such as ""Star Man's Son"" and i thought that that book was excellent, but ""Breed to Come"" was terrible. If there's one thing i've learned after reading books where the main characters are animals, is that i don't care about them- they seem so fake. While reading this book i had to keep reminding myself that these ""people"" were mutated cats, but they were basically just human-- the author just made them cats because she has some sick fetish with cats!"
1,Fred Szabo Doesn't Deserve To Be Called An Author,"This book is useless. I bought it hoping to learn more about the actuarial profession. I returned it after the first ""chapter."" Basically the author asks a question and then obtains responses from 40 different people in the industry (students, professors, insurance companies, etc.) It is extremely boring and informative. This is nothing more then the results of a questionare give to a few hundred people. Szabo isn't an author, he's a data entry clerk. SKIP!"
3,Only worth buying if you dont have web access,This is a compilation of mainly everything you can read at the CAS and SOA websites. It's a colletions for FAQs that actuaries in the industry answered and some of the questions weren't answered well. The second half of the book discusses the examinations which is a little helpful but again you can go to the websites for that. This book was not worth the price I paid.
4,Actuaries' Survival Guide: How to Succeed in One of the Most Desirable Professions,"Pluses> Good overview of the profession> Excellent explanation of career paths - valuation, pricing, consulting, pension, financial> Lots of examples of ""a typical day in an actuary""> Explains math skills needed.> Nice example problems that actuary solvesMinus> Book is 7 years old."
5,Worth the wait and expense!,"I've read ""The Art of Walt Disney"", ""Walt Disney Imagineering"", ""Disneyland:The Inside Story"", and several other books about the Magic Kingdom, and this book is by far the most detailed and enjoyable of them all. Every store that's ever had an address on Main Street...every sponsor that's ever had an exhibit in Tommorowland...IT'S ALL HERE. My only complaint is that I wish some of the illustrations were larger so you could take in more detail...but considering that every postcard ever issued by Disneyland is included, in addition to behind-the-scenes photos and concept art, this is an understandable compromise. Absolutely the best book ever printed on Disneyland."
5,An E-Ticket literary ride,"The Nickel Tour is ostensibly a pictorial tour of Disneyland's history through a presentation of every postcard the Park has ever offered. However it is so much more. Written by Walt Disney Imagineers Bruce Gordon and David Mumford, the books gives fans a glimpse behind the scenes of both Disneyland and its development wing- Imagineering. Want to know when an attraction opened? It's in there. Want to know the history of that attraction? It's in there. How about ""what might have been""? Yup, it's in there too. If you are fan of Disneyland, or just Disney, you will love this book. The writing is fantastic, the images wonderful, and the inside info is priceless."
2,disappointing let down,"After reading and adoring Tam Lin, I rushed out to buy Juniper, Gentian, & Rosemary, but after the first few chapters I was bewildered, and finished the book out of duty, hoping it would take off. The literary references in Tam Lin inspired me to check out things I meant to read in college but never got around to, where as the references in Juniper, Gentian, & Rosemary just seemed pretentious. ( I guess one expects references from a university crowd, but not from young high school students) I kept waiting for something intriguing to happen, some element of Faerie, but when it revealed itself I was alternately relieved that I had finished the book, and disappointed that there was nothing more."
2,"Curious, but tedious, too","A passingly strange book, this. As a look into the life of a young teenage girl, her family and friends, this is an interesting tale. As a story that falls between the slats of horror and/or science fiction/fantasy, though, it leaves a lot to be desired. The story starts out compellingly enough; the author gets you interested in her characters and their quirky lives... sibling rivalry among the eponimous characters is well done and quite realistic. When it comes to resolving the mystery that she's somewhat awkardly developed through the tale, though, Dean becomes absolutely ham-handed. It's as though she could hear the music for the final credits already rolling and needed to wrap it up in a hurry. As a result, it barely makes sense. No, it makes no sense. And that's a pity, because with another 100 pages or so, she might have had a classic."
2,Frustrating.,"I adored Pamela Dean's TAM LIN, but aspects of her writing (focus on characterization, leisurely explorations of philosophy) that were strengths in that novel occur at the expense of pacing and plot in JUNIPER, GENTIAN, AND ROSEMARY. Dean doesn't seen interested at all in her own plot -- girl beguiled by demon -- and largely confines it to the last 30 pages of the novel, as well as leaving myriad loose ends (Why does Dominic move in next door? What does he hope to accomplish with his time machine? etc.) Instead, we spend lots of leisure time with Gentian and her friends. While they're charming (like Janet and her friends in TAM LIN), the plot payoff at the end doesn't counterbalance the 300 pages of indifferent setup. Finally, Dean includes stuff -- such as a near line-by-line reading of two acts of Julius Caesar -- that feels wholly self-indulgent. A frustrating, disappointing read from a writer who can do better."
1,BORING,"The headline is my teenage daughter's one word review of this book. I thought she was being unfair until I tried to read it myself. No wonder she didn't like it! There was nothing and no one in it she could relate to. My daughter and her friends are nothing like the girls in this book. Sure, it's supposed to be a fantasy, but shouldn't the characters have more than one-dimension? And shouldn't something interesting happen? I have to echo my daughter - this book was BORING."
4,A rite of passage.,"This is a terrible book that I have read four times. Some books seem to have a character that are not quantifiable by the credibility of their plot or the fickle nature of their characters. Although dealing with fantasy this story is not in essence fantastic. The warmth of friendship, both within and outside the family, is the factor that first comes to mind when thinking of this book and it is this that has provided the impetus for my repeated readings. It is not a book that sits comfortably within known genres, on my bookshelves it sits alongside ""Franny and Zoey,"" as a great book to read when you are ill."
2,got knocked unconcious from all the name-dropping.,"I think the book averaged about 2 literary references per paragraph. (like stars?) Will look for her next book, though, in hopes it gets closer to this author's obvious potential."
4,A good choice of tunes with good quality,"On this CD, you have a good choice of tunes and marches with a good quality. The orchestration is good and the quality of recording is good. So, if you like this kind of music, you may buy it."
3,Stringed Backpack,Received quickly in good condition. Package was protective. Material was a little to heavy to pull strings to the point of shutting the bag.
2,Extra-stick,"Though this griddle is clearly well constructed and highly durable, after 3 days, I had no desire to use a chemical abrasive to scrape off everything that would stick to it no matter how slowly I preheated the pan and how much oil I used. I called Calphalon and was informed that I should be ready to use ""Ajax"" to get up oil buildup and not to expect foods to release like they would with a nonstick surface. I was aware that this wasn't a nonstick griddle, but was told that the Infused Anodized process facilitated easy release. Um, no. Pancakes, polenta... everything stuck to it no matter what. I returned the griddle within a week."
1,You cannot make pancakes or eggs on this pan...,"Contrary to the description above, this is NOT a non-stick pan. I tried making eggs and pancakes on the pan. Everything stuck to the bottom. I used bacon grease on the pan before I made the eggs. They stuck. I used butter on the pan before I made the pancakes. They stuck.I could not get the pancakes off the bottom of the pan without destroying them.This might be a good pan for searing and the cleanup that comes with it, but it is definitely NOT a pan to make breakfast or any other meal that requires a non-stick pan.My 12-year-old T-Fal with a worn surface outperformed this pan making pancakes. I am definitely returning it."
4,"Not exactly the king, but it'll do","""King of the Dancehall"", Beenie Man's new single off the album, ""Back to Basics"", has a bouncy reggae-beat with Beenie Man's trademark vocals, making this a great song to dance to. The song's only major weakness is, the song drags on just a bit at times, but it's not much of a problem because Beenie Man makes the song interesting with his quirky vocals. Don't expect anything like Sean Paul here, this is a unique dance joint."
5,Haunting,"These 42 black and white photographs, taken between 1979 and 1987 with Diana cameras, are eerily beautiful. The cameras were made in the 1960s, are constructed entirely of plastic, and have a lack of focus at the edge of the image. The photographs taken by Lindbloom are all of Florence, but not a familiar Florence filled with commerce and people, Florence is strangely empty and ghostly in these photographs which feature much sculpture and architecture. The text does not go through the photographs to talk about what they are of and how they were taken, so they might make more sense if the viewer has been to Florence, though all the photographs are titled by location. There is a preface by Linda Pastan, an introduction by Ben Lifson, a ""Note on the Photographs"" by Eric Lindbloom himself, and a very informative afterword on the Diana camera by Italo Zannier."
4,The 2263rd show,"This is a CD and a video tape documenting the Ramones last concert. The CD presents the concert in it's entirety, while the video shows clips from the concert, but is really a documentary about the Ramones entire career. The Ramones already released several concert albums, so why release another one? Well, this is their last concert, so that gives it added significance. Plus, there are several guest performers at this concert, although the CD oddly doesn't say which guests are on which songs. It is a typical solid show from the group. As for the video, it does a good job of documenting the group's career, with plenty of interviews and performance clips. Ramones fans will enjoy this package."
4,Well they are out of here !,"Well, this is one of the best Ramones live CD ever, it's not good as It's Alive, but better than Loco Live, the VHS is also cool but it's not well recorded it's more an ""home video"" but it have a lot of cool stuff to see. A must buy. END"
3,half and half,"This album is ok. Four of the tracks, namely 1, 2, 5 and 9 are absolutely great, but the other tracks just don't come close. It is almost worth the money to have those ffour tracks, because they are incredible. some of the other tracks are not bad, but if you can't decide between this album and another, choose the other. however, if there is no other album you are looking forwrd to getting, this is worth the money for those 4 tracks alone."
5,Live Is the Greatest band in the world!!,I loved this album. I listen to it all of the time. It is so great. All of Live's CDs are excellent. I love them!!!! Edward Kowalczyk is the best singer/songwriter/musician I have ever seen!!
5,A different kind of album,"I disagree with the above statements that claim that the lyrics of Live's third album mean nothing. This is simply not true. From Mental Jewelry to Secret Samadhi, Live's lyrical approach has changed drastically. They have gone from spoon feeding the meanings of their songs to a freer, more independent interpretation by the listener to make the songs what he wants them to mean. It is not a crime to respect the listener's need for finding his individual meaning in the songs he loves. I'd rather have it this way. Ed provides enough stucture to give a general meaning, but has been poetic enough to allow for interpretation. I love this album and I highly recommend it, as well as Mental Jewelry and Throwing Copper. These albums are well worth your money and each song is a masterpiece. Way to go, Live! And good luck on that fourth album!"
5,perhaps my favorite album of all time,"This album is perfect. Every song is good, with crashing choruses that leave your spine tingling, and verses, sometimes slow, sometimes driving to leave you thinking. It has a dark, gothic feel without the artsy fartsy-ness and glamour. This is the epitome of mid/late 90's rock. The choruses alone, not necessarily the lyrics, but the music theories involved, make this album what it is. Secret Samadhi was poorly received when it came out, because it lacks the live feel that Live had on Throwing Copper. Every song could've been a single on this cd. I definitely recommend Secret Samadhi."
3,SECRET SAMADHIIIIIIII!!!!!!!!!,"I enjoy Secret Samadhi, Live's third album. All the songs are good, with some Live's gems like RATTLESNAKE, LAKINI'S JUICE and GHOST."
2,"Church rhymes with lurch, genius!","What Secret Samadhi proves for Live is that, yes, they can construct a good melody, Ed Kowalczyk can infue his vocals with passion, but it's difficult to care with writing this trivial and altogether bad. Really bad. The opening track, ""Rattlesnake,"" has a good chorus to grasp onto, but the versus seem thrown together on the car ride over to the studio. It makes the whole record seem rather sheisty, and unwisely self-important (the pretentiously titled ""Insomnia and the Hole in the Universe"" has a line in the chorus that goes ""angel don't you have some bagels in my oven"")."
3,The weakest Live release,"While a fan of Live shouldn't pass up their third offering, Secret Samadhi clearly lacks what made their other three CDs so appealing. Not only do the lyrics lack the potent, thoughtful commentaries that have become a staple of Live's music, but many of them are downright silly, lacking not only a message, but sense in general. While this would not be enough to kill the album, the music behind the words is also lacking. While it often does take a while to appreciate many of their songs, these tracks never seem to stick in your head like so many others by them. While the first two tracks are very, very good, they don't make up for the rest of the CD. I found myself too often reluctant to even finish a track, instead jumping around to look for something better. I never found it."
5,One of Live's finest. Extremely Underrated,"This album is one of Live's finest works. With diverse songs such as ""Rattlesnake,"" ""Insomnia and the hole in the universe,"" ""Turn My Head,"" and ""Lakina's Juice,"" this album offers a very diverse offering from such a great band. It has a deeply felt undertone, that is hard for most of the here today, gone tommorrow bands of today to immitate. Much more genuine than some of their latest work, which is still very strong. This album is the greatest overall offering from Live and is not always given the full credit that it deserves. It is a must have for all CD collections."
4,What I think of Secret Samadhi,"It seems like I am the only person in world who failed to fall in love with Throwing Copper. I admit that Lightning Crashes is a pure classic, and a few tracks like All Over You and Stage have some angst appeal to them...but overall to me Throwing Copper is way too rough and raw, kinda like Mental Jewellary only more grungy and less passionate.OK now to Secret Samadhi...it's no classic...but it's more likeable than Throwing Copper. Lakini's Juice is as awesome as Live will probably get (juding by The Distance To Here album). Graze and Ghost are slow, but both are atmospheric and have really good choruses. Freaks is funny!As for the lyrics...well havent they been SLAUGHTERED by all of you! OK so the lyrics arent passionate, emotional, thoughtful etc...but so what? Ed sings them well...thats what matters"
3,No Secret,"Secret Samadhi is the follow up to Live's breakthrough album, Throwing Copper. The band was a little uncomfortable with the massive airplay they received, so they went for a harder, less accessible sound. The album is full of droning guitars and guttural vocals and doesn't have the melodic edge of Throwing Copper. While songs like ""Freaks"", ""Ghost"", ""Lakini's Juice"" and ""Unsheathed"" are superb songs, the album as a whole is average. This didn't hurt the band at first as the album debuted at number one. But in the long run, the album sold nowhere near Throwing Copper."
2,Emptiness,"I was very dissappointed with this album. Except for likini's juice and Freaks, the songs are ho-hum. The whole album left me with a empty feeling. Not their best album."
1,Why can't I pick zero stars?,"When I first got this album, my friends and I decided that it was all a big joke. Ed was trying to write the lyrically worst album ever written. Well, if that were his goal, I think he succeeded, but I fear that, in fact, he takes himself seriously. Mental Jewelry is one of the best albums I know of, but as time goes by, Live gets worse and worse. Musically, this album is average, but the lyrics are SO bad that I have to give it 1 or fewer stars. Ugh!"
3,hhhhhhmmmmmm.......,"Does anyone out there know where Kowalczyk lost his passion? This album is amazingly sedate, which disappoints me so bad that I cannot listen to it more than once in a while. I mean, after all, the sheer passion, intensity, and intelligence of 'Throwing Copper' was pretty damn hard to follow. But at any rate, the album does actually have some worthwhile material--'Lakini's Juice,' for instance. But I've still got hope for the boys from York, PA...."
2,Dissapointing follow up to Throwing Copper,"I was dissappointed with this CD. The raw energy, lyrical depth and beautiful arrangements of 'Throwing Copper' are not there. But then, that album was a hard act to follow. If you want to hear the best of Live buy 'Throwing Copper'. Maybe they can re-invent themselves with some new themes down the track. Maybe the boys have found nirvana after 'Throwing Copper' and just aren't angry about too much anymore. Their earlier album is slightly better than this one as well."
5,A VERY good album!,"I bought this after listening to lakini's juice, rattlesnake and turn my head.I must say i love Live even though i don't have the other records. Live rocks!"
4,Lucky this is not the lastest live album,"The art work says it all. Its dark and gloomy. I mean this album cant compare, even close to the distance or throwing copper. When I got this album for the first time years ago; I relly liked it. But my music standards werent as high. The rock songs on here, rock but do not reach pincale highs like songs on there other albums do. The emontion and lryics arent there. The lryics and stupid and just like funny, but not cause the music is so lonley and hopless. I dont have mental jewlery but I look forward to getting it. This album is good though. Do not get this one before there others, cause this is one of the best bands ever. This realese is a good thing to add to your live collection, just dont expect the emotion you will find on the others. This would be better as an acoustic album, its sounds like a remake of acoustic songs."
2,MAKES ME SCRATCH MY HEAD AND WONDER,"This is one of those albums that just made me get so pissed off. Lives previous two albums were real favorites to me(especially mental jewelry). Instrumentaly, and vocally, this is a very good album. But lyrically it just plain sucks. Ed used to sing about such cool stuff. Well, i guess most of the population who dont even listen to what lyrics say, and they just want somethin that rocks, or is pretty. they'll like it. But as for me, when im reachin for a live album, my hand is gonna go right past this one."
2,Perhaps the worst yet.,"It's okay, but the song formats are a little too much like those on ""Throwing Copper"", which, at five stars by my standards, was the best album of the mid-90's, right up there with R.E.M.'s ""Monster"". The songs on this one are shorter and have less good lyricism and much less complex music than ""Copper"". The songs also sound a lot like the ones on ""Copper"", but not as good somehow. Certainly the band is capable of more than this."
5,"If I could give this 10 stars, I would","I own every +Live+ cd and count them among my top three all-time favorite bands. I listen to at least one of their cds just about every day while in my car and think all but one (V) are masterpieces. Secret Samadhi was the first Live cd I bought and remains the jewel in their crown. The first time I heard the cd I was happily stunned. It wasn't like anything I'd ever heard before. The energy and passion in lead singer Ed Kowalczyk's vocals wowed me. The lyrics were intriguing, even weird in parts (I can't believe anyone would call them 'trite' -- trite is Mariah Carey's lyrics, people, not Ed Kowalcyzk's!) and the music was balls-out rocking. This quickly became my favorite cd and remains so, eight years later. You either 'get' this kind of intensity or you don't, and frankly I feel a little bad for those who don't."
5,Second Time Around...,"Hmmm, when I originally bought this album, it didn't have the impact on me of ""Throwing Copper"". It was subsequantly put aside for quite a while. After buying and playing ""The Distance to Here"" to death, I went back to ""Secret Samadhi"" and it's made a huge impact on me. So much so, that I enjoy it more than ""TC"". Anyway, great songs, great album. A little darker (not much) than ""TC"" but better for it I think."
3,Barn Burner it's Not,"As Live's music goes, I was not impressed much by this CD. Given Kowalczyk's knack for writing very expressive and emotional lyrics, I was totally at a loss for what the heck he was doing with the tunes on this album. Ed - were you smoking some really bad weed or something? Musically, this CD is as good as any other Live album to date.To give you an idea as to why I rate this CD only 3 stars, I've heard this CD numerous times and can't remember even ONE track that really sticks out; in fact, I can't even recall the melodies of ANY of them without going back and listening to the entire CD (ugh).As a Live fan, however, you take the good with the mediocre (or bad, as many might say). I think every artist needs a bad apple in the barrel every now and then to make their fans appreciate their good stuff (and NEWER stuff) all the more.So there you have it - a positive reason to purchase this album - to put everything else that Live has produced into better perspective.Peace Out."
4,"Very good, but first impressions aren't everything.","If you've read any critic's review, they'll say that they gave it 3 out of 5 stars or so. That's how i felt about the album at first, but then I listened to it a few times and learned to like it alot. It isn't as good as ""Throwing Copper"", but it is worth your money. If you liked ""Throwing Copper"", you'll probably like this one too, even though Ed K.'s vocals and lyrics aren't as meaningful and emotional as the ones on ""Throwing Copper"" and the music is a bit darker than the music on ""Throwing Copper"". Anyway, buy this album after you buy ""Throwing Copper""."
5,Makita 18 V Tool Set,"The tools have exceeded my expectations. The circular saw sounded weak running it without a load. When I actually sawed wood, 2x4,4x4, it cut very quickly.The third battery was an unexpected plus."
3,Good book for learning the many kinds of pastels,I found this book to be full of information about the different kinds of pastels that are available and the best paper to use when using pastels. It touched on the use of techniques in achieving whatever look you want.The pictures are beautiful!But as to whether by following the instructions you can get the same result is questionable. All and all a wonderful book to have but I think difficult for begginners who are just trying Pastels to follow.
2,Needs revamp,"While this book has some good tips and techniques relating to the use of pastels, and essentially that doesn't date much, the book does need a revamp.It is quite dated in its graphics and set-out. I feel that a re-issue with updated information on pastel products and equipment, along with new graphics would bring the book into the 21st century."
4,Buggy,"There is good information in this book, if you can stand insects, not the most delectable of subjects in my opinion. I read the Spanish version to learn some new words, but the illustrations are realistic. Children would maybe have fun counting the bugs on each page. I trusted the authors. Nature-loving children would like this book, and they probably could find some of the subjects in their own backyards, giving definite relevance to the topic."
4,Really good reference,"This book is awesome for gathering reference on drawing hands and feet. It doesn't focus much on technique, but it's worth the price."
4,Very Good - Examples and Some Instruction,"Lots of very good examples and some good instruction. The only thing better would have been to see a movie of him draw the hands and feet to watch his methods, etc."
