2,Nothing but problems.,"I have only owned this for about a year and I've had nothing but problems with it. First the bracket that holds the line once it's pulled out is so flimsy the bolts holding it went right through the holes. After a couple of ""cobbling"" attempts I finally got it secured with zip ties. Then, not long after, the plastic bracket piece on the main unit, totally broke and is not repairable. In between all this, when it would stay secured, I'd have to methodically place the clothes with an even balance.I would not recommend this item to anyone! A total waste of money."
2,Worked only for 4 months - then gave out.,"Initially, I fell in love with this clothesline as it has 5 retractable lines. However, today was its last day of operation. There is a locking mechanism that locks the 5 lines in place at whatever length you install the unit at. This (plastic!!) locking mechanism broke today when I hung my regular load of laundry out to dry and will no longer hold the lines. Very disappointed. Of course, the return period has ended. Perhaps there is a replacement part???"
1,Needs metal at stress points,"Poor quality, plastic brackets, April 3, 2009By Susan Young (DENVER, CO United States) - See all my reviewsThis clothesline lasted less than one month. The idea of the design is great, but the stress points need to be metal. For some reason, the brackets that hold a huge amount of weight are plastic, and the only metal is the handle and the attaching bracket on the opposing end. We loved it for 3 weeks until the plastic brackets snapped apart in a 5mph breeze and my brand new white sheets were impaled around a rose bush.The only part of the line remaining attached to a structure was the opposing metal bracket with metal handle. I would have gladly spent more dollars for a better product. Now I am on the search again! The company would have replaced the clothesline for me, but why? The clothesline is just going to repeat failure unless the quality is improved."
4,Solar Drying The Old Fashioned Way,"Besides drying your clothes in a quarter of the time it takes an electric dryer, you don't have to iron anymore, and your clothes smell great off the line. I can't believe I've waited so long to dry clothes the way mom did-- outside, on the clothesline. This Whitney Designs unit works pretty well, though it doesn't seem very durable to me. The plastic parts look cheesy, and like they won't last long. I've only had the unit for one weekend, so it remains to be seen how long it will last. There is a one-year warranty, however.I'd give this a ""Buy"" rating. $40.00 seems about right, though I paid $45.00 at Menards in Madison, WI.Retractable Clothesline"
1,Do not buy!!!!,I concur with the person who says this dryer is a sad waste of money. I have owned 2 so far and they break almost immediately! The plastic knob on the side goes and the line can no longer be retracted. I think it might work fine if you were looking for a permanent clothes line -- but then why pay that much money? I wish there were another manufacturer who made one that worked!
1,Whitney Design 15-7 5-Line Indoor/Outdoor Retractable Clothes Dryer,"The installation of this product stinks. I worked over 4 hours trying to install it from a level play structure to an existing clothes line post. It kept popping out of the hook and would not stay in place. It may work well IF you are using it inside with straight, level, even walls and floor. Outside installation can NOT be in any area that is not prefectly even, straight and level otherwise the line bar will NOT stay in the hook provided with unit. It will retrack back and can cause injury.Whitney Design 15-7 5-Line Indoor/Outdoor Retractable Clothes Dryer"
5,More than I expected!,I have had a couple of retractable clothes lines in the past but this was was much more than I expected. It definitely looks like I should have paid double of what I paid. The quality is great & it looks great. The five lines are very handy and it was very easy to install.
5,Clothes drying the Green way,"This is the second one of these I have purchased. Retired the first one when I couldn't get the plastic line clean anymore. After 15 years of drying, it was easier to replace the whole unit rather than the clothes line. Works great, stores into it's own case but does become black and moldy with our weather. It took years for that to happen. I like being able to put it away when not in use. Good energy saver for sure.Grand daughter likes hanging things out too."
3,"Overall, OK, but quirky","This is our second retractable clothesline. Our first met with an untimely end. We purchased this one because it seemed to have all the features of the ill-fated one. The first one Whitney sent to us did not retract properly, so after contacting the company, they promptly sent a replacement. The second one retracts. It is harder to tighten the line one it's locked than on the one we ruined, and some of the heavier or larger items (sheets and towels) tend to slip down the line and not stay where I pin them. Overall, though, it's what we wanted which is something with the capacity to hold a lot of laundry that we can retract when not in use."
1,Retractable Clothes Dryer,This is at least my third one I have purchased and I will say the quality has gone down. The lines won't tigthen up either when I am hanging clothes on them and also when I am rewinding it up. Not happy with the product.
4,quality product,Item appears to be well constructed and durable... Time will tell but I'm pleased so far and the installation was quick and easy. Would definitely recommend for the price.
1,SPEND YOUR MONEY WISELY.,The plastic brackets & knobs need to be replaced with metal. Direct sunlight would make the plastic parts either melt or become brittle & crack/break making the unit useless. Great concept/design but POOR durability & substandard materials used. NOT RECOMMENDED!!!
5,Clothes line works great!!,"I purchased the Whitney Design indoor/outdoor retractable clothes line, have been using it for over 2 months and I'm very happy about the quality and ease of use. The clothes line is very sturdy, and the line extends and retracts easily. It replaced 2 wooden standing clothes drying racks. I use it indoors and it easily holds a large load of laundry, I make sure that the windows and doors are open so the air can circulate to dry the clothes faster. I might look into getting the attachment to allow you to put it on outdoor posts so that I can get better use of it during the summer."
3,holds a lot of laundry,This item holds a lot of laundry; it's hard to attach to a tree; the locking pin on ours broke after only a couple uses.
4,Just what I wanted,"I had owned one of these (or something very similar down to the paint color) years ago. The unit was exactly as I remembered it except for a few minor changes to the controls, and my memory of what they used to be like may be faulty. At any rate, the installation hardware is identical. Use of the unit is intuitive I believe. It holds line tension without any problem. I don't think you'd hang all your rugs out at one time, but it supports even a good load of wet clothes with little problem, including towels. I try to spread the heavier items around on the different lines but no issues so far. The rewind isn't a problem. In general I got exactly what I expected and I'm happy with it."
3,coming up short,this is an edited review. i give three stars to the company shop at clares as they handeled me being upset very well and contacted the manufacturer for a replacement. they have good service and are very prompt. my replacement product was exactly as specified thank goodness.this is not 34 feet.!!!! it is in fact 28 feet ten inches. do not be misled!!! overall the product seemed ok until it didnt even reach the post i cemented into the ground at 30 ft. other than that i would give it ZERO stars if i could because of how upset i am over this whole thing. i may revise this review depending on what the seller does to fix the issue.
1,Cheap...Broke in a month...DONT BUY!!!,"The brackets to attach this product to home, garage, post, etc are plastic and lasted less than 1 month. For $50 I assumed this would be a lot better quality. Do not buy this product if you plan to use more than 3 of the 5 lines for laundry. It may seem like a lot of drying space with 5 lines but the plastic bracket can hardly handle 1/2 the lines used before it broke off the wall."
4,Great Clothes Line,"We installed this line in our basement, and it works great. Fairly easy to install. We had a bit of a complication finding a stud, but other than that it was not a big problem. We also set up a post for this unit outside so it is easy to move it around. ( You will need an extra set of bolts which we purchased at our hardware store. We have yet to use it outside since it has been winter, but it nice to know we have options.) It holds a ton of clothes, and with our family size of 5, we fill it up. I like that you can tighten the clothesline to stop it drooping. Overall a good purchase- just wish it came with someone to fold and put away all those clothes!"
1,DO NOT PURCHASE!!! POOR QUALITY,"We have utilized 2 of these units in the past 3 years. Each one was susceptible to the same fault, the locking screw will work, but the plastic that attaches the screw to the line holder breaks off leaving no tension on the lines for the clothes to hang. Kind of hard to explain but I wouldn't buy another. The company could provide a better construction material or method of construction, mabye using METAL that won't break! *** DO NOT BUY ***"
1,Don't even try it !,"THIS IS A -Star(negative) as it won't let me have no stars at all.This is the worst product ever, it came with some plastic parts that just melted with the sun, there is one screw that lock and unlock the wires that thing is plastic and melted after the 2nd day of installed, the dryer was not directly exposed to the sun (it was under a shadow) and melted anyway, don't waste your money as I did, buy something else."
3,awesome...until kids pulled on it.,"This product WAS great. We used it all the time. (It did sag more than we expected when full.) Sad to say that today, with one load on it, a 4 year-old pulled on a towel and the entire thing came off the house and snapped a bracket in half!"
3,ok product,"Initially I would have given this a better review, but after about 4-5 months of using this clothesline the lines started to break while hanging up clothes. That's annoying! I havn't had any trouble with the plastic parts as some other reviewers have. I am careful to not tighten the lines while there is clothes hanging on it. But the lines themselves are not sturdy as I previously mentioned. It broke off right at the end that you pull out. It had worn off from rubbing."
4,Household Essentials dryer,"I am very pleased with my retractable clothes line; it was easy to install and is easy to use. I have only had it a short time; cannot state the durabilty of the device. The only problem I can see is that the lines sag a little too much when wet clothes are hung on them, but not enough to cause the clothes to drag on the ground."
3,the lyric police,"It's fairly catchy, and her voice is nice but - ""open up your morning light and say a little prayer for I"" - you have to admit that's a pretty bad lyric. What the devil does it mean to open up your morning light? Open your eyes? Open the newspaper? And then of course, ""say a little prayer for I"" is gramatically incorrect (object of a preposition, it should read ""for me""), which I wouldn't mind so much if ""I"" weren't a very strained attempt to rhyme with ""light."" Pretty sloppy."
1,I HATE THIS CRYBABY SONG,"I just can't stand this song. I hate it! Paula Cole sounds like a sniffly crybaby whining about not wanting to wait. Although she has quite an admirable following, I think this song is dreadful. I hate it! It is very annoying, very whiny, very self-pitying. You'd be better off listing to something else instead. This stinks."
1,Short on pages,"Chapter 13 starts on page 154, and next page is 167 -- 13 pagesare missing. Please send me a new book with all the pages.thank You."
4,"Well, it is shorter....","Kids, think of this as an ice cream sundae with only the vanilla film and a speck of fudge on the inside of the sundae glass. It'll be enough for you to report on the significant parts of the sundae in great detail to Mr. English Teacher, but you'll have none of the feeling of having eaten an ice cream sundae, perhaps the finest food on Earth, if not the finest thing. Let's call this a loan. Use old Cliff to get through the test, but promise yourself that you'll at least pull up a chair to the book when you have the chance."
3,Disappointing,A little disappointed with the 2000 version. It dumbs down the material to a high school level. Perhaps I was disappointed because the 1966 Cliff Notes on Moby Dick by James L. Roberts was outstanding. I highly recommend that one if you can find it. Robert's Cliff Notes of this classic may very well be the best Cliff Notes edition of any classic work.
4,Like the trickstick love the more genuine streetball feel,"Pros: Much better at making players than ever beforeTrick stick is coolDunk contest is nice but more could be done with itgenuine streetball feel I like the real courts like the inclusion of the dome in Baltimore and Brighton beach in EnglandLike the gameplay of steet challengeInteractive gamebreakersPhatCons: Where MJ? The greatsest player in bball history really should be includedLacks the charecter of volume 2 more storyline would be nice, Street challenge should be shorter and more challengingMore variety should be available in cort creator"
3,Weak ass game!,"I like this game but, the slam dumk contest kindna weak. Street vol.2 is the best one."
3,Liked NBA Street Vol. 2 more,"This game is fun, but as this is the 3rd installment I was a little disappointed. Maybe my expectations were too high. I recommend renting it first to make sure you like it.Pros:-Online play is fun-Dunk ContestsCons:-New Trick Stick-Poor Training mode compared to Volume 2-Online play is 1 player per Xbox (no guests)-Graphics aren't any better than Volume 2-No Michael Jordan"
4,Books,"Scott Turow's first book if I'm not mistaken, up and coming author, hope he keeps it up, really enjoyed it"
5,much more than j expected,"This novel is so much deeper and introspective than I expected. Turow shatters the usual legal thriller genre with a well-written piece that combines the foibles of being human, being a member of a family and a legal tale. Highly recommend this to anyone looking for more..."
2,Absolutely Awful,"This. Is. Terrible. After reading ""Presumed Innocent,"" which I consider one of the genre-breaking books in crime fiction during the past 20 years, I turned to this. The beginning starts off brilliantly as the first chapter is the perfect mix of pathos and plot setting. Everything, however, goes down hill from there. A self-pitying (sexist) protagonist, aimless flashbacks, odd occurrences (and re-occurrences) by weak characters, and a plot that is convoluted (and seriously dated by today's financial standards), the book grows increasingly painful until the final page. Upon completing the work, I set it down, not with satisfaction, but with disgust at having wasted so much time. I gave it two stars instead of one probably because I admired Turow's first book so much that I wished this had been a better reading experience."
4,"Slow to start, but wow!","When I first started this book, I didn't know if I would keep reading it. I am compulsive - when I start a book, it is extremely rare for me not to finish it even if I don't like it. I thought about putting this one down, but decided I need to give it more of a chance. I was very glad that I did. Once I got into the subplots, I found it hard to put down. The subplots went a little too far in my opinion, but it made for a very interesting story."
3,Average Follow Up,"I thought the author slipped a bit with this book, not as good as some of his others. He constructed a good book with a step-by-step progress to the end and he can weave in a sub plot of two. I just did not like some of the writing; I found it a bit forced or dry. Overall he always delivers a good story, I would read his work over many others. You do need to pay attention with his books, they are an easy ride - he wants to keep you involved to then need. He is good at this form of book and if you like him you will like this one."
3,Turrow's soap-opera law story burdens more than proves.,"Turrow is a master of plot twists in this drama, but his characters are less than endearing. The descriptions and interplay among lawyers and clients are exceptional, and they support the center plot throughout. In the family interactions, which are frequent and central to the story, Turrow struggles. One wants to get to the fierce competitiveness and fine secrecy of the law story, but finds himself plowing through the uneasy muck of insecure relationships and misplaced affections. It still makes for a good read, but at times you will find no trouble putting the book down and going to bed."
3,Not a Fast Read,"Stifling details are intertwined in this thriller that could use less flowery description and more thrills. The story itself is not bad, but the ending did not make this a satisfying read."
3,A worthwhile read,"This was the first Turow book I read and I found it interesting. I admit that I had to read the book for school. However, I found the story line made me want to read more. If you like Grisham books than you will probably like this book. The two seem to have similiar styles. However, with this book, you really get to understand the main character better. Sandy Stern, the protagonist, was a very interesting and believable character. The various other characters make the book even better. I would definitely recommend reading this book. It is not great, but it is still worth the time."
2,It's ok reading....but nothing spectacular,"I've heard that Scott Turow's other books are much better. The story is at times intense, but the ending provides no punch. You finsh the book with a feeling of ""Why did I even read this thing?"" I would suggest Turow's other books..."
2,Compelling story but not intriguing enough!,I was very disappointed in this book. The characters were fairly dull and the author used a narrative that lay-people may not easily follow. I think the story was compelling but not enough to keep me intrigued. I certainly will try another of Scott Turow's novels.
1,Yuck! Don't bother!,This wasn't worth reading. Scott Turow has plunged a long way from the excellence of _Presumed Innocent_. I'm bummed I spent money on this book. I gave it away to the library swap rack.
2,Keep your dictionary close at hand,"The plot is interesting and one that could have made for excellent reading. However, the writer made one fundamental mistake which every lawyer tends to make from time to time. He had to show off his knowledge of ""big words"".Unless the writer intended for this book to be read by scholars only, my advice to the average Joe is to ensure that he has a dictionary opened when he begins to read because the plot is buried in grandiloquence.I am myself an attorney and an English major and I found this book tough reading because I was basically stumbling over unnecessarily big words which made it difficult to appreciate the plot fully.A great writer is able to get his ideas across in uncomplicated language. It is after all a work of fiction, not a dissertation."
5,Incredible!,This Record is absolutely amazing. My dad bought it years ago and it has been played over and over in the household. A Lord of the Rings fanatic from a very young age my parents still tell me stories of how i cried when i realised that everyone was dying when they went to the Grey Havens. This is such an emotional story and the music written by Bo Hansson does it complete justice. I recommend it completely!
5,Absolutely fantastic!,"I am so thrilled you have this in CD format. I have the album, which I bought when it first came out. Have been dying to get it as a CD so I could listen to it again - the music is fantastic, and used to be something I listened to often. Now I can again - thanks!"
3,An interesting piece of music - but desperately dated,"When I heard this in college, I thought it was really cool - I had read the Trilogy in high school, I loved keyboards (still do), and this album was amazing. At age 52, I just listened to the LP again...and it's REALLY hokey. It's well done, and it was progressive for sure, but it's still hokey.If you want more details about the album, other reviewers have covered them well. Three stars for technical quality."
1,Hugely Disapointing,"Wow, I can't believe how cheesy the music was. I mean it is VERY 70s - pull out the lava lamps and beads. I didn't think that the music in any way was evocative of the story. Lots of synthesizers, lots of drums and symbols - very techno stuff. There is no depth, no warmth, and no charm to this music. I suppose it could remind you of Tolkien's work....if you're on drugs. Too surreal, dude."
1,crap,These songs only remind me of one thing. Bad seventies ..... music on saturday night live. It is a disgrace to J.R.R. Tolkien and should have never been written
5,Best Introduction to Real Philosophy,"This little book is the best introduction to real philosophy there is. Gilson's ""realsim"" grounds the reader firmly in reality. He disdains the philosophies that take us from reality, such as those of Descartes, Spinoza, and Kant.Read the short section at the end, ""The Realist Beginner's Handbook,"" once a month for a year and you'll see the world as it is. It's 30 paragraphs of common-sense realism applied to philosophy.For years, used copies sold for $60 or more. Now it's in print again, and on Kindle."
3,Better than the original.,"Babe is back, but I mean, who expected this? I certainly didn't expect a sequel from a film like ""Babe"" because the first one was so crap, but this one makes up for it. It is alot better.This time Babe has gone and lost himself in the big city, and he meets monkeys in pyjamas, dogs in the water and singing pigs!This film is pretty silly but enjoyable all the same. I wouldn't recommend you buy it, but if your bored like I am, rent it from your video store for a laugh."
4,entertaining for the adults and educational for the kids,"...Babe has still maintained its charming character (brave,benevolent and hopelessly friendly).My five year old really fall inlove with Babe. The story just grew more complicated since it happened in the city and you see more characters(human as well as animals)as the story developed. The movie is so full of actions and humours. My daughter laughed so hard at several scenes and she watched it several times a week and each time she discoverd something new and wonderful in this story. The movie was done in a stunning cinematic way, for the young audience it may be take some time to completely sunk in the story, but its gentle message should not be missed by anyone. There are a few scenes maybe a little frightening for kids below 8, but overall it is very entertaining. It is definitely worth seeing both for the adults and for the children. Watch it, it gets better everytime. END"
4,Babe should become a franchise--like the Bond movies.,"I like this movie as much as the first--although because of different reasons. Not as much of Ferdinand the duck as in the first one. I'm sorry I thought the scenes with Ferdinand were the best of the first. This time there's a whole new cast of animals. I especially liked the Jack Russel terrier. I can't say I thought this was the best movie of last year. the last few scenes in the ballroom were a letdown, I thought they were too long and drawn out--but everthing leading up to the end are knee-slapping hilarious."
4,A Better Babe,"I was fascinated by this movie from start to finish. There is so much to look at in every frame that one viewing just isn't enough. Mind you, I am an adult with a taste for the apocalyptic vision. (Road Warrior and Blade Runner are two of my favorite movies.) That said, my children were not taken with the the pig's urban adventure. It really is not a children's movie -- at least not for the under eight crowd."
2,A big disappointment,"After wacthing and enjoying ""babe"" with my kids more times then I could count I was looking foward to the sequel. Unfortunately I was very disappointed. This sequeal is dark and almost ugly with sexual inuendos and adult themes. Hardly the moving family movie that ""Babe"" was."
1,A Terrible Sequel to the Wonderful Movie Babe,"Hello, We really looked forward to the sequel to Babe - Babe was such a wonderful movie. This Pig in the City movie though did not have the charm the first movie did. The movie had many questionable scenes and at one point they had a dog being dunked under water and my daughter screamed in horror to turn it off - I wanted to give it a chance because the first movie was terrific. I can't believe they would follow up with a movie such as this one."
1,Disappointment,This movie was a disappointment compared to Babe. It was definitely not a classic sort of movie!
1,Sequel of Dissapointment,"I loved (and bought) Babe, the original movie. It was full of beauty, originality, a great story, and a wonderful script. Because of that I expected something similar in the sequel. What a dissapointement.I generally do not expect a lot from sequels. Most lack the actors and creativity of the original. Pig in the City is so different from the original that the producers should have named it differently and put other animals and characters in it. It is the worst sequel I have seen to this date. It has nothing of the elements that made the original a success and something worth for your collection.If you loved Babe, be prepared for a big dissapointment with Pig in the City. What the heck did they have in mind? Go buy something else."
1,This Movie is Dark!,"My 2 year old loves the first Babe movie. He is always asking for Babe. With that in mind I bought the second movie thinking he would like it as well. I put it on the top self of the closet as soon as we watched it for the first and last time. It is a poor movie, however its worst sin is that it is not for young children. A dog almost drowns hanging from a chain, another dog with a cart is dragged by a truck and tossed to the side of the road, and there is a very long sceen with the animals being rounded up by evil looking animal control people. This in not the light harted movie we were looking for and our son will never see it again. I am sorry I wasted my money on it."
1,Add me to the disappointed side,"It seems to me that the viewers of this video either loved itor hated it. Add me to the hated it side. As said many times, if ithadn't been connected to the original ""Babe"" perhaps my expectations would have been different. Had I been primed for an ""artsy"" film, perhaps I would have felt differently. Probably not though."
4,Babe as Groucho?,"Unfortunately, many of the professional reviewers and non-professional reviewers connected to strongly to the sweet ""Babe."" If this movie stood wholly on its own, it would be seen as a Marx Brothers type comedy it is. While ""In the City"" is somewhat dark, so are the Marx Brothers' movies. The zaniness in this movie reminds me of nothing more than the Marx Brothers. Kids love Groucho and they love Babe too when ""In the City"" is viewed on its own merits."
1,Babe- Pig in the City,"Dark, unsettling images of animals being mistreated, lost, and otherwise engaged in activities inappropriate for young viewers. My 2 year old loves the first Babe, but I will not allow him to watch the sequel. I would strongly urge parents to pre-screen this one."
5,Two Great Films in One!,"BABE THE GALLANT PIGA touching fable abuout a pig who wants to be a sheep dog.BABE, PIG IN THE CITYAn imaginative, funny and moving film that completely lives up to the original.The ''character animation'' in both movies is excellent, the animal's mouthes move seamlessly and smoothly, their voices are perfectly suited to their parts, and their personalities are colorful and engaging. Too bad they didn't make a Babe three."
1,Horrible waste of time and money,My daughter is on day five of stomach flu and we thought we could pass the time by trying out the instant video feature through amazon and our ti-vo hook up. I can't believe that so many people gave this movie five stars. It is wrong in so many ways - from stereotypes - to scary scenes - to animal neglect and inappropriate humor for children. My daughter is seven and even had the sense to tell me that she thought the movie was terrible. What a big waste of time and money. I can't believe there are people out there who actually wasted there time making such a senseless movie. It could have been done better in a number of ways. AVOID!
2,Not that funny nor that entertaining,"Few sequels live up to the original, and I consider that the case here. Picking up where the first movie left of, the action quickly moves as Farmer Hoggett falls into a well and hurts himself, the wife fails at farming, so she and Babe go to the city to find help. Horror is what they find, and Babe has to rise to the occasion to save the day. The themes and moods of this movie are much different than the first one. Whereas the original Babe was very lighthearted, with occasional scenes of suspense and thorror, this movie is the opposite. Here there are mostly scenes of suspense, with only some lighthearted scenes. The comedy is not that good, but the special effects are a lot better. The overall look of the movie is darker too; instead of a city with bright greens under a blue sky, we have concrete, roads, and building walls. This reviewer did not like this movie that much, and was disappointed."
4,Are you sure this isn't directed by Terry Gilliam?,"Whoa, WIERD!!! Man this movie is dark and weird, and it reminds me of Terry Gilliam, specifically his movie ""Brazil"". The movie has this weird, dark city setting, and this sort of totalitarian feel to the society, especially the Police in it. But, it is good for the way it's interesting. Not for little kids, trust me."
1,Not even close to the original,"After watching this movie, I was very disappointed with the producers. Dark, maybe. That wasn't my concern, there was a dog almost hung, another dog almost crushed by a car, among the few mistreated animals. The lessons learned were much to small compared to the outlandish details they supplied. Why do we need children to see black leather and studded gang members, giant lacey bloomers or large sized bras to ""show them a touch of reality"". The first movie was a cute story made for kids. I think this one was a big mistake."
1,Shocking!,"Whoever likes this movie, feel free to like it. But really!! I heard in my local newspaper how they were going to rate it PG-13, with every curse word imaginable except that one - and they squeezed everything down to ""darn"". Seeing this, I was a little freaked that two year olds were watching this with their older siblings who were really 4 years older... it's shocking!"
3,Scarier for kids than the original Babe,"After being completely charmed by the original BABE, especially the little mice singing Blue Moon, my three year old and five year old were frightened by the mean talking dogs in BABE IN THE CITY, and we had to turn it off. Too bad, disappointed, after eagerly waiting for it to be delivered, but great for older kids and adults"
1,Not for young viewers (zero stars),The freshness and wholesomeness of the first movie is noticeably lacking in the sequel. It is a very dark and depressing movie; almost the flipside of the original. Placing the primates and other animals in human clothing and having them perform 'tricks' is one of the lowest forms of entertainment. Totally degrading the animal and the viewer. The only good point in the movie is at the end when the chimps are allowed to 'act like chimps'. The first movie was unique and quite enjoyable for young and old alike. The second is a severe disapointment.
1,I would rather watch a SEAL HUNT,"BE WARNED... there is NOTHING in Pig in the City that makes this experience worthwhile for anyone who appreciated the original! There is senseless hurt, suffering and death of animals in this movie.It may sound petty to say ""Hey, animals suffer in this movie!"" but in the light that Babe is shone, it is WAY OUT OF CONTEXT... this is NOT a movie for your kids... or anyone for that matter.It is about as entertaining as watching a seal hunt. (you have been warned)"
2,NOT VERY GOOD,THIS IS SOME WHAT CHARMING BUT THE MOVIES SEEMS TO BE ONE BIG TRAGEDY AFTER THE NEXT.THE THE LAST MINS ARE TOTALY UNFUNNY SLAPSTICK.ALSO WAS WAS JAMES CROWELL NOT IN THE MOVIE MORE HE WAS PART OF THE MAGIC OF THE FRIST ONE.I WAS VERY DISSAPIONTED WITH THIS.
2,A let down,"Not as good as ""Babe"" by a long shot. Still the characters we continue to follow act as we would expect. Frankly I'm not sure why the film creators felt the need to go to a city to further Babe's adventures. I'd recommend strongly that you watch it on television or rent it with some others before investing your money in it."
1,One of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen,"Do not show this movie to your children unless you want to give them nightmares. It almost gave ME nightmares, and I'm an 18-year-old who just saw ""Gladiator"" for the second time.The tone of the film is dark, brooding, depressing, and invariably scary. Truly awful things happen to just about everyone. The nice farmer is horribly injured in a frightening accident. Animals die (or almost die) in gruesome ways. The farmer's wife is strip-searched in a scene reminiscent of rape. It's disgusting and frightening. This is rated PG?The film does look good, but what on earth were the filmmakers thinking? This is NOT a movie for children--or anyone else who even vaguely likes animals. There's a difference between a film with a dark side and a film that is simply sadistic. If you must satisfy your curiosity, please, please watch it by yourself before showing it to your children."
5,Babe Double Feature,"Babe Double Feature is about a farmer and his animals that touch the hearts of young and old alike. The animation is fantastic and the story plot warms your heart. The second feature, 'Pig Goes to the City' takes the newly found fame of Babe to a new level. It's a classic and a must for all ages."
5,Dark and Wonderfull,"Magnificent. Can't bring to mind another movie with such a grasp of the duality of man, maybe The city of lost children. DON'T MISS IT."
4,We love the Babe movies,"We loved the first Babe movie, so of course we wanted to see more of Babe. This movie is great too, but maybe not quite as great as the first one, this usually happens with sequels. But I certainly would recommend it, very funny, full of action."
5,Now here is a great family film,Ever since it was first in the theaters I loved Babe. Especially the singing mouse trio. Ok in 2 Ferdinand got rather tiresome. He wasn't comic relief just annoying & self absorbed. the story could have done even better without him.However a 3rd no thank you I'm glad they had the sence to quit while they're ahead. Some keep slapping on sequal after sequal & only manage to tire the whole thing out.I admit I only have these on VHS but this is on my wishlist. It should be on anyones wishlist who is young at heart. Enjoy.
4,Great,"Although it is very dark, not for children, and shouldn't be rated ""G,"" this movie has got it all. I still think the original Babe is better though because of it's lightheartedness but Babe: Pig in the City is indeed a great technical achievement. The special effects and cinematography are by far more advanced than the original."
1,Don't Watch This Movie If You Are Depressed,"The first movie Babe was dark and sad at times but had many high notes, however, this movie was sad and depressing for the most part. The animation and special effects were great. The mice made the show as well as Ferdinand the duck. I feel this movie is too scary for the little ones. Talk about a bad hair day for the Pig. At least the Pig prevails. Although we all know how cruel people treat animals, I don't think children are ready for this one. As a animal lover, I found the movie heartrending even though things worked out. In the real world, they usually don't. If anything comes out of this sad movie, is perhaps a child who may show more compassion to animals. Leave the moral lessons to me. Glad I saw it before I took the young 'ens."
3,Stinky Mattress,"The bed seems rather comfortable, but I can not yet give an accurate review as the smell is so irritating that I can not bear to lay on it for more than a few minutes. We have had three fans running for 5 days now with all windows open and it still stinks. Our eyes water, noses burn and a headache starts within minutes. It is quite disappointing as we have a new mattress that we are not able to sleep on. We have been camping out in the kids' rooms."
2,Too soft to be happy,"I was happy first as i received the mattress, very fast shipment, great communication with the seller. But unfortunately this mattress wasn't the best choice for my back as it gets softer after couple of days of sleeping on it, even that I weight 159lb, its still going deeper and deeper. To return it, not so easy, once you unpacked it from vacuum sealed bag, you will never get the same thin shape of it, to send it back will cost you the price of the mattress."
4,Love it!,"My husband and I absolutely love this bed. We were a little worried after reading some reviews, but tried it anyway.It did have a slight latex odor the first couple of nights, but we were able to sleep on it the first night without any problems.We also woke up a couple of times the first few nights sweating, but that is better now. I have had 3 back surgeries and withOur old pillow top, would wake up stiff and painful. Now I am much less stiff and feel more rested. I also don't toss and turnLike I used to."
5,Trim-Maxx Tea,"We have been purchasing this product from our local Vitamin Shoppe for the past year. Just this week when I went to purchase, I was informed they were no longer stocking it in their stores. It has been a very reliable product in aiding mild colon disorder's from irritable bowel syndrome. Has been far more superior than any prescription agent or alternative supplement's on the market. No cramping, abdominal discomfort or bowel urgency associated with this product. 1 tea bag at night before bedtime is how we use it."
1,Awful,This product gave me Awful stomach cramps. Seller has a no return policy. Read the entire ad before buying. Did not work for me. Not what I thought.
4,easy to learn Burmese,The book is good but it makes it much easier to understand and help with the pronounciation when you have the CD's to go with it.
1,Not good,"It was over price and stale. I threw them all away. Very, very disappointed. It didn't even taste like this cereal."
5,The best cereal you won't find on your grocer's shelf,"I absolutely love this cereal. It's really for adults - not too sweet and just right out-of-the box. It stays crunchy in milk, and has five grams of fiber per serving. It's not Captain Crunch and I guess that's why it's so hard to find."
1,"Seriously, 8.25 per box?","Please oh please folks, start protesting they are charging 8 $ a box. Yes this is hard to find perhaps that is because no one is willing to pay $8 a box. the same box int he store costs an outrageous 5.25. Forever cereal companies have been making a huge profit on our desire for quick and easy breakfast but these prices have to come down and that will only happen if we demand it. I mean seriously what do you think the COGS are on this box. less than a pound of organic material plus processing, packaging, and shipping. This product does not even spend a penny on marketing so no cost there... Sell it for 3 a box and I make this a regular staple in my family."
2,DO NOT TOUCH!!!!,"I happen to be a fan of Fred Olen Ray's movies, but you must fight all urges to buy this one, folks. First of all, the picture quality wasn't that great. I've seen worse, but it is poor quality and very grainy (which suprises me given the good quality of other Retro Media titles). Next, the acting is atrocious. I can usually deal with bad actors and actresses (as I said earlier, I'm a fan of Fred Olen Ray's movies) if the plot is decent enough or if the story is at least entertaining enough. But this is absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen! There are no, I repeat, no redeeming qualities in this movie. So, why did I give it two stars you ask? The extra materials, that's why. There are some pretty neat things on the rest of the DVD (such as Nite Owl Theater bloopers, outtakes of the movie, and, of course, a new episode of Nite Owl Theater). But believe me, it is not worth the price of the DVD. STAY AWAY!!!!"
1,Wish I could have seen it,"I'd like to be able to write a review of this, but the widescreen DVD version didn't work in my home player or in my PC. After trying two copies with the same result, I gave up on it and picked up something else. There appears to be a problem with the widescreen release, buyer beware. This was very disappointing, as I'm a big fan of Nite Owl Theater and was looking forward to seeing this one. Maybe next time . . ."
3,A very weird movie,It has a good message but it is kinda hard to follow. The writer had a differant way of looking at heaven and hell. The graphics and special effects are fun though.
5,Great movie,"I love love this movie. Robin williams is my favorite. I have streamed to by tablet, as well as purchased this for a friend."
3,What dreams May Come,"This was a good Movie,a little over my head but it don't take a whole lot.But I did get what they were getting at. All and all I would order again.It's about killing yourself,and where it will get you."
5,Very Unusual and Thought provoking,This movie takes you on an unforgettable trip into the next life beyond the physical world.Well done with great actors and story line.
3,Where Do You Go After You Die?,"Few movies deal with what happens after death, and this is an interesting one, with great visuals. I got quite involved in the beginning, but quite detached after the main character dies and becomes a spirit... Have I been subject to too many intense movies lately? See it and see for yourself...If you are a romantic, the idea of a man literally going down to hell to save his wife will surely appeal to you."
3,Metaphysical film,"I bought this film because the story was originally written by Richard Matheson who also wrote the story which lead up to the Somewhere In Time"" film. I found the film somewhat hard to follow at times and feel it is simply not in the same league as ""Somewhere in Time"", my favorite film of all time!"
3,Good film,"This film is a ""bigger picture"" film; it is a pick-me-up to when the ""turkeys got you down""! I liken this film to Grand Canyon; stranger than fiction....The type of film that points out there is more to life than what you see...I prefer the alternate ending as to the film's ending."
4,A near great film,"I really enjoyed this film. The acting, particularly from Williams and Sciorra was fabulous. The visuals were incredible. The thing that ruined it for me was the idiotic bible-thumping subtext of a heaven and hell in the afterlife and of suicide being a ""sin"" that must be ""punished""; this is totally wrong as to everything reliable that I have learned about the afterlife. The image of the wicked having their faces walked upon as punishment is laughable at best. If you can get past the nauseating christian theological interpolations, the romance and the love of the characters for each other, and their loyalty to each other is uplifting."
2,Awesome movie but.....,"The movie was really awesome but the only thing I was very disappointed was that it was not closed caption. I had no way if I was buying a movie that has already closed caption or having subtitles. Neither were on it. But I do love the movie and I had someone interpreting to me the whole movie. I would like to see in the future that there is a symbol that shows ""CC"" so that any hearing impaired will be willing to buy without worry! Please!!"
2,Great Depression,"I recommend people watching this movie with their TV set on 'mute', just look at the colors on the screen."
4,I can recommend this,"As far as HD goes, the colors in the movie are quite amazing. They were bright to begin with on SD, and shine very bright in the HD version. Few specks or EE here and there, but nothing to write home about. This is a disc you can show friends. They will say ""Whoa"" freaky bright colors. In the ""Hell"" scenes it is very dreary and dark, and does a pretty good job with black levels. The only part the disc suffers is in Audio. Perhaps they dont do lossless sound because it's mainly a talky movie I dont know, I just wish the audio had more oomph. So, dont expect a WOW factor with audio.Now as for the movie, you will either love it, or hate it. It's a head trip, and challenges your notions about God,heaven,hell, etc. If you dont want a ""thinking cap"" movie with a taste for the dreary at times, this is not for you. If you like ""Different weird"" movies, this is for you."
5,"No matter your beliefs, this movie will make you think","What Dreams May Come (a line from the famous 'To be or not to be' speech from Hamlet) is ranked among my all time favorite movies. I personally believe in a life after death, and my own views vary from those presented in the movie a bit, but that didn't stop me from enjoying this movie thoroughly. What makes this one of my favorite movies is perhaps the attention to detail that they put into feelings and human emotions, particularly the concepts of regret and what it means to have true love. Ever since I lost my own true love, this movie makes me cry, but I love it all the same. It also helps to remind me that I need to always strive to be a better father."
3,"It was good when it first came out, but.....","We saw this movie when it first came out and loved it. So when time went by, we thought we would get the blu-ray version for our 65"" flat screen and audio system and sit back and enjoy it. But we didn't. Things change over time, maybe our thinking or the way we re-act to something, but to us, this movie lost it's appeal. It's still an interesting story line done by a very creative writer, but for us what fit then doesn't fit now. Still. first time viewers may love it. People I've talked to either 'got' this movie and think it's the movie popcorn was invented for; or people didn't 'get it' and hated it. To each his own."
1,blarrggh,"sadistic and mawkish tripe in which williams' fulsome brow crease travels through heaven and hell to realize saccharine prophecy involving breathless, noisome cuba gooding and max von sydow's stern glare. torpid fun for the whole family."
1,"Out of pity, I award this movie a star","Ugh, another example of Hollywood's ineptitude at capturing the soul of a beautiful story...Even if not compared to the book this movie is supposed to be based on (by the way, the movie seems only to have borrowed the title and names of the characters from the book, nothing else), this film lacks ANY oomph. Once again, Hollywood compensates for a poor story line by over doing the special effects. The characters remain two-dimensional throughought the film...the only thing mezmerizing about it is the fact that Williams was able to stay awake to play his role.Contrived, shallow and thoroughly disappointing, whether you compare it to the novel or not."
1,this movie really sux,"if i could, i would give this 0 stars. thankfully robin williams played in it or it would suck even more then does. my dad said he saw the coming attractions for this movie and it looked pretty good, so my family went to see it in the theaters. well, in about the 20 minutes the whole family dies. then, the rest is just so confusing and very hard to follow. i think the movie had really good graphics, but the whole storie line was horrible. sorry but this is not a have-to-see movie."
1,Boring movie,"Visually the movie had its moments, but other than that this movie was pretty lame. After the first half hour I was knocked out cold. Skip this one."
1,"flat, unoriginal, and over-done","This is pretty bad: a guy dies and lives on in some bizarre afterworld, where he rights certain wrongs and gets an idiotically sentimental philosophical perspective on his life and love. Then, of course, he takes a dare and changes the destiny of his great love, etc.The film totally failed to sweep me into some believable fastasy, but just came off as pretentious and emotionally flaccid. It is a total bore and there is nothing new whatsoever.It seems that this is not a general opinion, given the other reviews, but this is how I saw iy and I cannot change that if I want to be honest. Not recommended."
1,Get the Pepto Bismol!,"Yes, that revolting color of pink Pepto Bismol coordinates nicely with this nauseating movie. I can't believe I watched the whole thing! I kept waiting for it to get better. To live up to the rave reviews on the box. Instead, it kept getting more and more ridiculous. The story is hackneyed and dumb, the special effects looks like a horrible starving artist painting. Robin Williams looks embarrassed to be in this movie, as well he should. Don't waste your time."
1,Never bought it for a second,"OK, let me get this straight--the afterlife is a sticky, icky mess of paint blobs; the heavenly city is a Fellini movie; and angels who take all kinds of confusing physical shapes say things like ""When you do, you will."" Huh? Oh, and hell looks like a collection of old ""Waterworld"" sets, with all those ""Titanic"" extras still floating in the water. Sorry, but this one missed the mark. When will Hollywood make a real film about real spirituality?"
1,Williams can't save this movie,"I myself am a big fan of Robin Williams. But this movie is the worst in his career. He does a good job with his role but the movie itself is slow, boring and could have been done in under an hour and a half easlily. If you are looking for a Robin Williams movie that is worth the while, see Mrs. Doubtfire or The world According to Garp. If serious drama is more your style, see One Hour Photo."
1,unsatisfied,"i ordered this in novemeber and was sent an email saying it was shipped on nov 21 i still have not recieved, have contacted seller 5 times and recieved no contact from them, buyer beware i wouldnt suggest anyone order from them."
4,Affirmation of love and hope,"Before entiring the movie theater to see What Dreams May Come, I purchased the book, so that I could read all the details of this experience. I'm glad I did, see my book review. The movie is daring, breathtaking, believable, heartwarming, real but most of all soul searching. To love and be loved for all eternity, to believe that love can transcend to the next life makes one want to live and love the moment. The art of loving is not magical, not easy but worth the risk, death does not take love away, death magnifies love."
5,"Special effects, music, story. All MAGNIFICENT!!!!!!","This film is one of the greatest, if not the greatest, film that has ever seen the special effects realm. The rich detail in special effects makes this film alone worth watching. Williams, Gooding Jr., and Sciorra all play fine roles in this heart-warming tale. The music and sound effects are also top-notch. If you have not seen this movie, don't wait another minute and head to your local video store and get this movie."
2,almost did it for me....,"i thought the movie was pushed to the end too fast. they should have made it alot slower... i mean, one second, their in heaven enjoying the the beautiful surroundings, the next, their in hell trying to save robin william's wife! it was some-what far fetched.... also i could tell that they intended to make it an emotional rollercoaster. but it just wasnt. that was a major minus! the plus of this movie is the special effects. they were fenominal! the way they portrayed heaven was great!!! makes you wanna die and be there already!!! im glad they won the oscar for special effects..if you wanna be amazed by great eye-candy, dont miss this film! but if your in the mood for a tear-jerker, stay away from WHAT DREAMS MAY COME!!"
5,My favorite love story,"This movie has incredible effects, wonderful acting and a beautiful story. It's a nice change from all those sappy, been-there-done-that romances. This is a beautiful and original movie about love conquering all. And it doesn't just involve the love between the husband and wife, but also the love between the parents and the children, and even the family dog. It uses wonderful images of both heaven and hell, and will make you wonder what each would be like for you. Two thumbs up."
1,One Star Might Be a Generous Review,"My wife and I finally rented this. The preview looked cool, but looks can be deceiving. With a prior knowledge of the storyline, we figured we would still enjoy the movie. But it was, in fact, pretty bad. The colors and visuals are great, but the story is weak, convuluted and confusing. Wait for it to come out on T.V."
1,"Robin, Please Go Away!","Even through this was poorly reviewed upon its theatrical release, I rented it thinking that the special effects could redeem the film. Wrong! Once again, Robin Williams proves he's the most affected and cloying performer in film. Cuba Gooding's excitable persona continues to irritate. Worse, the whole thing sinks into a misama of images that have no discernible relationship to the actors and the story. And to think, matters only get worse when Robin goes OTT in the smarmy ""Patch Adams."""
1,"For a Christian, this stuff is offensive, Garbage","I saw the movie on an American airline flight to Vancouver form Dallas. I was not impressed. The basis for the story line/plot gave me real problems and I am not a Christian Fundamentalist.Once the movie lost me on the setting, everything else was downhill."
1,This movie made me want to throw things at the screen!!!,"I absolutely hated this film, it's on my worst 5 of all time. I can't exactly say what made it such a frustrating experience but I walked out of the theater thinking that I would rather be run over by a semi than be forced to sit through another screening of this film. I love Williams, Cuba was amazing in Boys in the Hood, and the visuals were spectacular, but the film was so bad that even the great FX didn't allow me to give it more than 1 star. Probably the hardest movie to sit through of 1998, (and Armageddon came out the same year!)"
4,excellent view of religion,"I have never found a more concise, accurate view of what I believe to be true about life/life after death. I say this having talked to many people (my clients) about their near-death experiences and such people as Dannion Brinkley. An excellent film."
2,"hey, at least its more fun than ""patch adams""","robin williams was carving out a strong career for himself. then came movies like this: mush about being a family man. i guess he still hasnt gotten over the guilt pangs about dumping his wife and running off with the governess, because he keeps making this movie over & over again. cool special effects tho, it might be fun to watch on acid."
1,Spare Me!,"Painfully boring! Ten minutes into this movie and I could care less where Robin's character was, what he did, where he went, what he thought! Boring! Boring! Boring!"
1,Awful!,"This movie is among the worst movies I've ever seen. It lacks a coherent plot. The story wanders all over the place without ever getting anywhere. The movie relies on maudlin scenes between the characters. Unfortunately, the characters are so weak that you don't really care what happens to them. Save your money. This movie isn't worth your time."
1,Unhappy Customer,I wasnt happy with product i received as I was unable to use it in this country.... and part from that it looked like a copy DVD .... it was a cstly exercise for me and but I have learned not to make this mistake again
3,The use of classical symbols,"I bought the film so I could see again the interpretation of Heaven, Hell and Purgatory as based on Dante and a collection of classical paintings from the Renaisance and 19th century France. Robin Williams is the best I've ever seen him in a difficult role."
2,Sumptuous visual feast as filling as a cracker.,"I was hoping to come away from this movie with more than the empty feeling than I did. Even though the visual presentation was intriguing and beautiful, why the Vail's? No one appeared as they were until some prerequisite had been met on the part of the newly deceased. Williams sucked in this quasi-emotional serious piece. I was unable to feel any empathy for his self absorbed wife, the piece meal way we learned why she took her life her left much to be desired. I had no pity for her character, and thought she should have been left in hell where she belongs. I guess I am blaming the wrong people, the screenwriter and the director share equally for bringing such crap to the screen."
2,Very Creative but lacked something,"I saw this movie and I really didnt think it was funny, touching, and to me it really didnt make much sense. I love Robin Williams but felt this film just didnt cut it. I cannot explain why but I couldnt sit through it again if I tried!"
4,this is a pretty interesting movie,this movie is really awesome to watch.it has some great special effects and williams is a great actor. it was a lot of fun.
4,ART and movie satire reign,"Scenery and effects are worth the view. When our daughter was four, we visited Italy, including a museum in Napoli which had a small room full of one vast Nativity Scene which included everybody and everything, entire village and then some. Our daughter sat on her father's shoulders and, as she entered this room, she cried ""Oh! It's the whole world!"". That delight mirrors mine in seeing these wonderful effects. In addition, it tickled me to find Max Von Sydow, THE (Ingmar)Bergman actor, leading Chris to a Bergman ""hell"" of black and white. It's a great ""in"" joke and everyone should NOW see Bergman's films! Williams can never resist a one-line throw-away and his play on "" a sea of faces"" is irresistable. As well, it's refreshing to consider ""beliefs"" from others' points of view, maybe causing us to ponder our own. To some,the story-line may not be ""gripping"", but the view is wonderful and worth it."
3,Alternative Ending is Better!!,"The Acting is Solid - The Special Effects truly inspiring, well done, tied together RIVALS Brazil for inspiration of effects! - The Story Line is Basic, but entertaining and possibly even thought provoking BUT the ending is a MAJOR let down! As soon as the movie ends - go to the special features and select the alternative ending, it reflects a more solid ending, an ending that goes with this movie - - - whoever made the changes to the ending, must have done it for commercial reasons, and I consider that to be a major sell-out!! There is SO much ART in this film, that to let the integrity of the original ending be changed for whatever reason, is criminal."
5,I fell in love with it,"Robin Willaim's two sons die in a car a car crash,then he gets killed in a car crash.His wife can't stand being alone,she kills herself and goes to hell.Robin Willaims finds his wife is in hell and goes to save her. this movie is so touching yet,sad it make you think,is life going to be this bad? I cried throughout the movie.I recomend before you see this movie get a stackload of klenek."
5,makes you wonder,Wow! I thought that the imagination that it took to make this movie was incredible. It really makes you wonder about afterlife and how everything that you do here on Earth greatly profounds every aspect of yours.
4,Amazing,This movie had me lost & found at the same time. Makes you think about your own life & your deaths? Can life after death make you think now? I think so.
4,Visual delight with ethical dilemmas,I enjoy Robin William's in off beat non comedic roles and this is certainly one of them. The artistry and visual tools used are very intriguing yet the reason I purchased this was for the heaven/hell/suicide/power of love conflict. Film brought out many interesting dilemmas. And Cuba's performance is always solid.
2,Read the book,I agree with those who were disappointed with poor film of a great book. Stars are for visuals only.Plot changed a lot from book. Guess getting rid of the kids cut down on salaries.Think the only movie I've ever seen that was as good as the book was TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. Every would-be adaptive screen writer should be required to study both book and film BEFORE beomg allowed to attempt the same.
3,it had some positive effects,"This movie is very saccharine. Some of the visuals are nice to look at.This is a VERY, VERY comforting and totalizing view of life/death/morality.Robin Williams dramas tend to be...heavy-handed.But I went to sleep before the film ended the last time I watched it. I was woken up by my wife kissing and hugging me, asking me ""are you my soul mate?""""Yes!""So it made for a nice moment between us. For that, I'll give the film three stars."
4,visual awe and moving plot,"There are already so many reviews describing the movie so i'll skip the synopsis and just get to what i think. I'd give the visuals a 4.5 out of 5 (based on the year this was filmed it was amazing and still holds up for the most part besides a few scenes here and there) and the colors and set designs are amazing. I'd give the plot a 3.5. Just take it all in as someone's view of the afterlife and of love and it makes for a pretty heartfelt, moving and unique story."
4,Poignant,Anyone who has lost their child or their mate can identify with this movie if they let themselves.
3,"A tearwet ""far too much""-drama...","...that indeed deserved its' Academy-award for the amazing special-effects that dominates the movie. Yes, visually it is fantastic, it is facinating and ""dreamy"" to watch (and becomes this way anything but boring) but the story however -well, the image of the life after death becomes chaos, the theory on hell (I realize this is no ""religious""-movie, just imagination vaguely based on the faith in God) -but here in the afterlife everything is just as confusing as it is in the life on earth. The story offers no beliavable ""attempts"" of giving any answers, even in ""Heaven"" there is pain -and frustrations. The topic is real love. But real love does not save the couple (or the family) What Dreams May Come introduce us to. And frankly, the drama is nearly embarrassing -tragic after tragic, too much. And the ending, isn't ""Heaven"" a place worth staying? ""No, let's do it all again -life after all was so fantastic!""Silly story, fantastic picture! Recommended!"
2,Talk about killing a perfectly good book!,"It's not like I hated this movie. I thought Robin Williams did a good job and visually, it was very unique. Of course, I had to be one of those people who reads the book before seeing the movie. And I think we've all seen good books get slaughtered on film. So, although a good movie, it severely lacked everything that made the book so great. Actually, it was practically a completely different story taking place in the same settings (Ala ""Jurassic Park""). Of course, there were other things to. The kids die, and when he gets to heaven, he doesn't really seem to care. The camera work when he first dies was poorly edited. The entrance to Hell looked like the stage at a Kiss concert. Little things like that. But in short and without going into a much longer speech, I just want to say that for once, if you are really curious about the story of a man in heaven who goes to hell to save his wife, then just read the book."
4,Cinematically Gorgeous and Philosophically Intriguing,"What Dreams May Come is a beautiful and haunting metaphysical tale of life after death.Neurologist Chris (played by Robin Williams) and his artist wife Annie (played by Annabella Sciorra) had a fairy-tale life until they lost their children in an auto accident. No sooner do they begin to recover when Chris meets his own untimely death.Chris meets up with an angel named Albert (played by Cuba Gooding Jr.) who gives him a tour of his afterlife. The images are stunning--with Chris cavorting through vibrantly colorful, impressionistic, oil-painted terrain.Meanwhile, Annie becomes depressed and takes her own life. Chris must then traverse heaven and hell to save Annie from an eternity of despair. The mystical themes that I enjoyed in this movie are that of redemption, the power of love even beyond the grave, and life after death."
2,"Surrelistic, but....","A Critic once said that this movie is like walking through sand dunes with led boots. It's very easy to agree with that. There are so many plot holes in this movie, I don't know where to begin. The writers try to cover up these plot holes with random occurences that we are supposed to believe just because we are in a fantasy world. Miracles can be fun, but watching a magical event, one after another for 2 hours, is ridiculous. I love fantasy movies, but this just does fantasy and science fiction all wrong, and gives it a bad name. I'm not very religious, but what I notice is that people who are not religious hate this movie for it's views. Funny thing is, most people who are religious hate it even more.This movie is hard to stomach, the only thing that is worth watching are the absolutely beautiful computer rendered scenery.Not Reccomended."
3,"It is a living painting, a visual masterpiece!","The theme of What Dreams May Come is everything except original: one more time there is more after life with a touch of romanticism. All the stereotypes concerning the after life, including those about heaven and hell, are present; and the performances are far from convincing. What really attracts attention in this motion picture are the astonishing visual effects, never seen before: as an impressionist painting, the paradise is an explosion of colors, a painted dream brougth to life by imagination; and the other worlds are completely surrealist. It is a living painting, a visual masterpiece, it is What Dreams May Come!"
1,Bored me to death,"This movie had me in tears.. from so much yawning! It presents someone's view of what comes after death; If you're good, then you make your own fantastic reality, even being being able to fly. If you're bad, then you make your own hell, based on your fears. It's like being in one big, childish dream. The visual effects are pleasant, but only for a short time. I couldn't stomach Robin William. I kept hoping for him to come up with one of his wise cracks, like on his roll of the ""Geenie"" in Aladin. Save your money, don't go see this dud."
1,Closed Captions/Subtitles unavailable in English,"This DVD is marked as closed captioned, but what's missing is that there are no closed captions or subtitles in English, only in French and Spanish. I don't know French or Spanish, and need English closed captions. Luckily I got this DVD from the local public library rather than bought it before I found out I have no access to the movie through lack of English-language closed captions. There's no way to add this information near the top when the specific features of the DVD are given, it only says that a movie is closed captioned or subtitled or not, so I can only give this information down here in the comment section.Amazon.com, please allow for the ability to say whether closed captioning means English or not. It's not meaningful to say a movie is closed captioned if it turns out none of the closed captioned languages are in English.I wish I could give zero stars rather than one star, because this movie wasn't even accessible to me at all."
1,A complete and utter disappointment....,"My British Literature teacher assigned this movie because it deals with theology and we read poets who express their theology in their poetry. I can honestly say I will never watch this movie again, unless forced to. (And yes, I even told that to my professor!) This movie was such a disappointment after about the first 45 minutes or so, especially when it got to the hell part. I even had to quit watching at that particular part because of boredom. I was also disappointed because of Robin Williams' character giving up HEAVEN to be with his SUICIDAL wife. Now how lame is that??? Yes, the scenery was nice to watch, but the plot was, and I am being nice, HORRIBLE. If you want to watch a movie, I recommend NOT watching this, unless you want to watch a horrible movie. Sorry Robin Williams, you had better luck with Mrs. Doubtfire."
2,Disappointing judgement on suicide,"Just saw this at a friend's home. I always like Robin Williams. I did not know the whole story but liked that its about the afterlife. I did not expect anyone to ""go to hell"" for suicide after loosing their children and then later their spouse. It was a turnoff. I dont believe those in deep despair are to be jugdged totally by this desperate single action. Its as if their whole life counted for zero and a horrid few months or years of unbearable grief makes them horrible enough to burn forever. How mean and how silly for US to come to that belief. I think when outside horrors kill one's spirit and ability to go on, that many suicides are not thought out in any way. And they are very personal..not meant to harm anyone else. PTSD comes to mind.. loosing all one's family is another. (and the Bible was written by man btw) Suprised Robin would do this movie."
1,blecch!,"This film is visually ambitious and sometimes spectacular, but that, in my opinion, is where the quality ends. An apalling mawkish screenplay and an embarassingly unctuous insipid performance by Robin Williams made me squirm through much of this film. He can be so phenomenal with the right material, and this simply wasn't it. Also wasted in this lurching mess is the estimable Max Von Sydow. Don't waste your time or your money on this bomb."
1,DVD transfer process a disaster.,Reviewing DVD only. Largely out of focus amazingly poor quality film - to digital transfer.Movie itself almost as bad. Very disjointed.
1,"Maudlin, preachy, excruciatingly boring fantasy","The two long reviews on this page are very well done - one for, one against the film. To sum it up though, it's a very maudlin, depressing, boring and pointless treatise on metaphysics, emotionally unengaging and a waste of time. The visuals (both Art Direction and Visual Effects) are, however, brilliant and stunning and will probably win (deservedly) Oscars this year!"
3,Emotional rollercoaster,"I agree with others that movie is visually stunning, but it is way off-base from Richard Matheson's book (which I enjoyed very much). It has been glossed over with a Hollywood happy ending which was a huge disappointment. Some of the scenes were borderline cartoon-y and unnecessary to the story (especially where the kids died first, sending Ann into her downward spiral). Annabella Sciorra was amazing though, she was happy, smart, sad and tortured, sometimes at the same time. Her performance was just enough to keep me interested until the end, but for the most part I still have a bad taste in my mouth."
3,Love and Death,"This is a story about death. Chris and Anne meet and get children. The children die in a car crash, and their mom never forgives herself for not bringing them to school themselves. Chris (played by Robin Williams) dies himself in a freak accident when he wants to help someone. She herself kills herself later.Chris ends up in heaven, which looks like the paintings his wife makes. Their he meets a sort of guardian angel played by Cuba Gooding. But he is still not happy, he loves his wife and wants her back but unfortunately: suicides go to hell. But through undying love he gets her back to heaven.The colors and the settings are beautiful, the artwork is amazing and therefore alone worth watching. The ending is however a little too cheasy. The DVD has a different and sadder ending, it would have made the movie better but Hollywood probably thought it a bad idea.If you like dreamy movies about what is and what is not real: this movie is for you."
4,What Dreams May Come,"An outstanding movie, but one you need to watch several times to understand the subtlities of the characters. The cinematography was outstanding."
5,Not for the faint-hearted!,"You must be prepared to watch this movie. This movie will stretch you. This movie will challenge your beliefs. This movie is very ""artsy."" Robin Williams is fabulous as usual. The visual effects are staggering. This movie has left a lasting impression on me, and it is a work of art."
4,Its like a 2 hour Trip,"This movie, though depressing its one that makes you think about life and opens your mind to things you werent thinking about before it started. The special effects are so amazing its like real actors in a cartoon type world.. very differnt than any movie I have ever seen. I say, watch this movie if you want to think intensely about life"
2,Boring and typical Robin Williams facial expressions,"I got the DVD version because I wanted to see this beautiful movie in better resolution and sound which they are really good. But I agree with the other viewers who said this movie is depressing and boring. I just have to add to those comment about Robin Williams acting. He is a good actor but when it comes to dramatic roles, he only has same few choices of facial expression in every movie. It was good the first time but it got really annoying. Good jobs for the special effects though."
2,"Effects on eyes nice, effects on mood horrible",You better be in a great mood to watch this movie. Otherwise you will be thrown into instant depression. I could barely watch this movie it was so depressing. I guess it makes you think but unless you want your mood to be brought WAY down dont watch this movie. The end does nothing to make it better either.
3,Strange... Maybe Genius.,"I love it when Robin Williams goes away from the norm and makes a movie that many can appreciate for its creativity, kind of like One Hour Photo. This movie, as original as it is, is a very strange, strange movie. Amazingly though, Williams craft grows, and continues too. His acting in this movie is superb, and even believable, even though it's totally unbelievable. Which makes it even better. What's also great about this movie is that anyone who has had a soul mate, maybe to the point of obsession, can appreciate this movie. It's a desire to keep your love, even if it means crossing over Hell to do it.So, overall interesting. Maybe see it, but with caution."
4,Smiles when he CRIES.......Bravo!!!,robin williams cry when he smiles and smiles when he cry....not too many can do that but i can't tell the difference so it looks kinda funny but nevertheless mork from ork knows how to give out an emotional performance on cue but its something to get use to if u never seen him act before. the movie is visually fantastic with all the bells and whistles to give one a sense of what heaven and hell could look like. i did cry a little in the end but not cry a river like some might. it has a good ending but gets depressing before that.
4,Beautiful and insightful,"I loved this movie, especially the paint scenes. It is certainly a thinker movie. By the end when the wife gets so depressed and he tries to rescue her, it really brings you down and made me not want to watch much more. If you have been depressed, you can really relate, and it is sad. I think if you don't buy this movie, you should at least rent it once to see it."
4,This tears you apart...until the end.,"This movie rips into you (if you are one of those people that cries easily). I loved the artistic qualities (her paintings coming to life). This movie had all the makings of being perfect, until the end. I think someone got confused about how it should end. Or maybe they decided to lighten it up and give it a happier ending. The main character was meant to be a tragic person. It didn't make sense that she should try life again. Overall, the movie was pretty good and I recommend owning it."
3,Depends on your mood!,"This movie has some very interesting concepts and a few interesting cinematic effects. I guess that I'd characterize it more in the category of ""chick flick"" than anything else. It shows emotion and relationships. If you're in the mood for something like that, it's worth the view! Don't come to it with expectation of anything intellectual or action-oriented. Anyone with strong religious convictions will likely find it unsuitable--it doesn't really meet any church dogma that I'm familiar with. Just sit back and watch it for fun and for the utterly unique storyline."
4,Great Buy.,Love this movie. I was glad it was shipped fast and was in great condition. Nothing wrong and it was a good price.
5,Made me wonder ...,"It made me wonder if my husband would cross hell for me or more specifically, if I would have the strength to cross it for him."
5,One of the best movies of this decade!,"This movies is, perhaps, Robin Williams' greatest performance to date. Annabella Sciorra also turns in a classic, Natalie Woods-like, performance. Though I seldom watch movies more than once, this movie, like the Wizard of Oz, should be seen more than once over time."
4,"Very, Very Different",The cinematography and special effects are totally different than I had seen before. How did they do that? This movie keeps you guessing. Robin crosses the boundary between life and death for the love of his life and finds a life and death struggle. I believe you will either LOVE it or come away neutral towards it because of how different it is.
1,Godawful...,"I thought that anything was better than watching that *sshole Steve Martin until I saw Robin Williams. If there were any justice in the United States, Williams would be banned from making films in America and banished to a remote island off the coast of Greenland - where he could live out the rest of his life picking his nose and eating kelp.I watched ""What Dreams May Come"" from beginning to end and I thought that Williams was about as entertaing as a crutch. The other actors in the film were equally as forgettable.Forget about renting this dvd. You'd be better off watching your television with both the sound and the picture turned off. That way, any program you could imagine would be better than this..."
3,A Visiual Study of Love and Life,"Although the majority of this film deals with the death of the main characters, its' true message is one of love and the value of life. Visually, it is an incredible feast of color and light descending into the black and dark depths of hell. I felt it portrayed Dante's Inferno with vivid terror! The character's were real and well acted and it is a film I would reccommend only to those removed from a recent lose of a loved one. The message in the end is of hope and renewal however the content may be difficult for someone that has recently experienced death in their lives."
2,Rent This Movie To Help You Sleep...,I was bored to tears by this movie. I usually like this kind of movie...I don't know what happened with this one.
2,check out vincent ward's other movies,"great dvd, loaded with extras-pity about most of the movie...a mawkish, almost embarrassing storyline saved only by director ward's imagination and visual flair.he's a great director and deserves better material than this.watch ""vigil"", ""the navigator"" and ""map of the human heart"", all available on vhs. all are brilliant. so what's next mr ward?"
3,Strange movie,Not what I expected. Lots of sensationalism. Not the spiritual movie I had been led to believe it was.
3,Sure is pretty,"Plainly, this movie still sucks narratively, but boy does it look pretty in High Def. The premise is way more interesting than the actual direction, and I knew this going in. I'd already seen this film in the theaters years ago and I remember not liking it much then either.The reason to get this film is as a showcase of my 50"" Kuro. The afterlife sequences are simply dazzling. The color reproduction is better than I remember it looking at the cinema. Well worth the price. Look out for the Hell sequence with it's sooty textures. In the dark, and with a great television, you fail to tell where the rooms blackness ends and the picture begins.Jaws will drop. Is that reason enough to pick this film up? You decide."
4,"Incredible imagery, plot line sometimes hard to follow thoug","Although the use of colour and images is phenomenal in this movie, the plot seemed a bit hard to follow at times. The character of Cuba G. Jr. was difficult to follow until closer to the end. Parts of the movie made me cry, others made me laugh. It's definately a feel good movie."
5,"A good, touching movie","I found this movie to be a very touching and moving experience. While I don't necessarily agree with some of the religious conclusions in it, it is still a very good and worthwhile movie. The effects were incredible, the music was good, and the casting and dialogue was right on the money. Also, I LOVED the ending. While some others found the ending to be incomplete, I found it to be understated, and as a result, more poignant and powerful than it would have been otherwise.I'm not the sort of person to cry while watching a movie. In fact, I could probably count those experiences on one hand. However, there were SEVERAL points in this movie where I got a little teary-eyed. As a result, I HIGHLY recommend this movie, and gladly give it 5 Stars."
4,Intriguing story,I personally was not that taken by the cinematography as others were. It was actually the story that grabbed my attention. This is somewhat surprising because I don't consider myself religious in the least. But ultimately I found this story to be more about self-realization and improvement based on the realization and that is something that engages me. I found the performances extremely well done and the dialogue still seems fresh upon every viewing.
3,"Crap script, amazing spectacle","This story is cliche ridden garbage. What saves this movie are the amazing visuals that manage to create this fantastic world. For that reason alone, it is worth a look. It takes you somewhere you've never been before."
1,Visually stunning?,"I waited for this movie to transcend the pretentious, derivitive visuals especially the awful artwork but it ended up being just as bad. I read some of the reviews and the comments are consistently favorable of the visuals even if they did not like the movie. The only way I can understand this is by also seeing that somehow the awful art of Thomas Kinkade is so popular. It is so marketed and fake, served to you as great art. That is exactly how this movie has been served to you, don't accept it find something real."
1,Garbage,"This movie was garbage. It was obviously written by a politically correct, left wing, Hollywood elitist. When Robin Williams dies, his son comes to him in the form of a black man, and his daughter comes to him in the form of an Asian woman. Give me a break! Annabella Sciorra did a great acting job, but that's about it. This had the potential to be fantastic, but it missed the mark terribly."
1,AWFUL,"Seriously, got the movie OVER a month later. don't buy from this seller. freaking SUCKS. i could have freaking got it and mailed it to mySELF faster, and they don't return emails. Awful, awful, awful."
1,"Potential ""Deep Meaning"" was totally overshadowed by chaos","All right, I understand that this movie had very deep and meaningful intentions, but, being the Williams' lover that I am I thought I would check it out. I was very disappointed with the outcome. It seemed that the whole movie was chaos and tried to pass only by its amazing visuals. I didn't believe that he loved her enough to go to Hell for her, and I thought that the whole picture was just a wierd dream that one of the scriptwriters dreamed up one afternoon. The movie definitely didn't come close to it's potential. I thought it a waste of money."
2,"Delivery fine - Product, not so much.","Delivery was timely, and product was received in good condition, with what appeared to be original sealed plastic cover. Video portion was fine, but audio is extremely uneven and required constant adjustment during playing. I have not complained to the seller and probably won't - this is probably part of the risk in ordering DVD products."
5,Received promptly,Theatrics and philosophy rolled into one. Strong performances from Robin Williams and Annabella Sciorra. Tries to give a personal side to death and life after death..... and of course Love triumphs all.
3,Provocative Consideration of This World and the Next,"I had a lot of trouble with the imagery and cinematography of this film which often distracts from and competes with the story and the profound philosophical and spiritual issues the story explores. Nevertheless the views on love, the afterlife and the transcendence of love explored in the film invite ongoing reflection. It has an ongoing subliminal influence that overcomes the gimmicky and sometimes off putting images. Anyone who has suffered loss of a loved one to suicide or to a tragic accident will find a lot of comfort here, I think. I love the idea that here on earth and in our afterlife, we are responsible for our own destiny and I love the idea that we can continue to help and celebrate our loved ones"
4,some day my dreams may come,"What Dreams May Come is one of those films that you'll either love or hate. Anyone expecting a comedy from Robin Williams will be disappointed. Robin Williams, I feel, gives his best performances in roles that are not in the comedy genre such as in Good Will Hunting. Again he brings a commanding performance and this holds the film together. This is a film filled with emotion and the visuals of the film depict this. The overall feel of the film makes you want to slit your throat however this film does grow on you after watching it a couple of times (if you can stand it that long). Overall a good movie but not his best. For those wanting to see a ok film of epic proportions then this will be for you."
2,"Odd, interesting Adventure","Robin Williams dies and goes to heaven, or something of that sort. This is the story of him trying to get back to his wife. The special effects are amazing. And of course Robin Williams is good as always. But it was just too long, a little boring, and there wasn't that much there to work with. Some of the points I didn't agree with, that is being a Catholic. But I'm not saying it was a bad movie, it was okay. I just probably won't watch it again."
2,Depressing and draining,"I didn't think this movie was nearly as visually stunning as everyone seemed to rave about. It was very depressing and energy draining. The acting, in particular, was sullen and depressing with sporadic manic episodes, displayed mostly by Robin Williams. Robin Williams should stick to what he does very well--comedy. He's pitiful at drama."
2,What were they thinking?,"Sure, the artistic design and special effects are great, but were the screenwriters drunk when they spewed out the script? The unusual premise aside, the characters are not believable and the plot is choppy and contrived. People think this movie is ""deep""? Come on! A film isn't deeply philosophical just because it is about death and the afterlife. It has to make sense too!"
4,Overview of several couple therapies,"This is a collection of chapters written about couple and marital therapy. The chapters are authored by recognized experts in the different therapies, and contain theoretical background, techniques, and case examples. It provides a general overview of the therapies, without going in great detail about any of them."
3,very boring read,"This book exposes you to a lot of types of therapy, but the chapters arevery dry and boring. Unless youa re used to reading APA style i would not recomend it."
2,THE BOTTLING IS POOR,i HATE THE PACKAGING AS I TOP DOESNT SECURE THE PRODUCT PROPERLY AND IF THE BOTTLE FALLS EVERYTHING IS THROWN AWAY. ITS NOT ORIGINAL ITS LIKE A REFILL BOTTLE
2,It evaporates quickly,"I bought this after really liking it several years ago. For some reason, I can't get the scent to last on me like it used to. It evaporates quickly. The metal part of the perfume bottle came off within a couple weeks, so I wasn't very happy with the quality of the bottle that I got. Kind of bummed that it didn't end up being what I wanted."
1,Shipping Problem,"Don't buy these if you expect to get a pristine product. What I got were big boxes with ""heavy"" caution labels. Inside were shards of nail sticks and a shredded box that looked like it was dropped off a roof. Of course the air cushions was all deflated. What Amazon needs to do is: strap the box so it doesn't burst; use an appropriate size box; and use resilient padding material--not air sacks that fail when the box is moved."
1,Glimpses of Hildegard under a heavy overlay of Fox.,"This book claims to be ""Text by Hildegard of Bingen with commentary by Mathew Fox."" In fact, it is nearly all Fox with only occasional brief quotes from Hildegard. Confusingly, Fox uses ""illuminations"" to mean what Hildegard and everyone else calls ""visions"" rather than the pictures in manuscripts which are properly called ""illuminations."" This book contains, however, twenty-five reproductions of these pictures. To judge from other reproductions of the same pictures, the quality of the reproduction seems mediocre. Here you can learn only what Matherw Fox, a Domican, thinks about these visions. To find out what Hildegard said about them visions -- which is far fresher and more stunning that what Fox has to say -- one will have to look elsewhere. As an introduction to Hildegard, I would suggest ""Hildegard of Bingen, A Visionary Life"" and ""Secrets of God: Writings of Hildegard of Bingen,"" both by Sabina Flanagan."
2,"Abysmal commentary, OK pictures","Fox's commentary paints Hildegard as a rather mushy New Age spiritualist. (Which she was NOT!) The book's only redeeming quality is it's large, full-color reproductions of her illuminated manuscripts."
1,I hope there's more to be awakened....,"I wonder if I read the same book as the other reviewers. This collection of generally religious thoughts on various relevant midlife topics such as loss of parents, surgery, friends, and continued growth, didn't go beyond the suface and the obvious. While its brevity makes it easy to pick up, I feel it comes up short on depth and stimulation. The Chicken Soup for the Soul book series is so much more real, thought-provoking, motivating and inspiring."
4,"""i gotta tell ya, I don't swallow""","Real nice B-grader, Lambert has a real flair for the comedy, if only the people behind the camera could make up their mind whether it's a action comedy, or action thriller.Because it's certainly not the latter, but the laughs dry up a bit after the hilarious first half hour.Leary always entertains as the bad guy as well."
1,For the CineVu disc,"Starting with the packaging, the outer artwork looks like low-quality inkjet output, streaks and all. The physical disc is labeled ""Compact Disc"" with CineVu's label overprinted as ""DVD Video"".Cheap and cheesy, and I could accept that...IF the disc had actually contained a widescreen, Dolby 5.1 presentation of GUNMEN as advertised. IT DID NOT. Instead, the disc contained a program titled ""Amalia Rodrigues 50th Anniversary Concert - Live in New York"".I adore GUNMEN, I've long awaited a widescreen DVD. I can't express the depth of my disappointment with CineVu, or with Amazon for selling this dreck. I'm sending the disc back post haste. Buyer beware."
3,typical action movie,"This movie is really pretty lame. It's a typical action movie with typical characters. I enjoyed it just because I like Christopher Lambert, which is why I'm giving it 3 stars. Otherwise, I wouldn't have liked it. But it does make for decent entertainment if you're into this type of movie."
1,Journal Of An Exploring Tour Beyond The Rocky Mountains,poor quality zerox copy. Maps advertised in the first few pagesare not there. Print too small.
2,Extremely weak - 2 good cuts,"I like really smooth jazz - the kind that you can listen to while cruising down the boulevard in a convertible on a cool night and only 2 tracks fit the bill: Noodle Soup and to a lesser extent, En Route. The rest is either too abstract or funky for me. What a shame - it took 5 years to make a really bad album. You're better off buying the few good individual songs via download than paying for an entire CD of stuff you won't want to listen to and make your own CD with other cool artists such as Down To The Bone, The Rippingtons, Wayman Tisdale, etc."
5,Great driving music,I discovered Four80East through a recommendation and have purchased all four of their albums. Great driving music!
3,Good for the money,"First of all, I like that these come pre-sharpened and ready to go straight out of the box. Quality is better than Crayola or Rose-Art (my least favorite). Color is pretty good, but my main complaint is the texture. These are not as smooth as I would like, and the tips do tend to snap off. Overall, it's a good intermediate set for any budding artist, just don't expect professional quality."
1,Horrible,"Don't Buy This.If you are looking for the real Phantom Of The Opera,you have not found it.This is just some small 50 page book that leaves all that is great about Leroux's book out.First off,it is told from Erik's point of view and gives all the major plot points out at the begining and that takes away from the whole mystery that the original novel was based on.Go and search again for the ACTUAL novel!"
5,Easy to understand,"This version of The Phantom of the Opera is an excellent one for beginning readers and adults as well. For beginners, it is an easy-to-understand way to introduce the classic work. But this is also true for older readers. The unabridged version is an excellent book, but it might be hard to follow or just plain intimidating for many readers. Reading the Stepping Stone version first will give a clear understanding of the book. For instance, time jumps around in the regular version - and the history of the Phantom isn't even given until the very end. The Stepping Stone version proceeds from start to finish with the normal time frame. Readers who enjoy the book, will find the transition to reading the ""real"" book much easier. Stepping Stones are a great way to ease kids and adults into classic reads."
4,Clever,"Told from Erik's point of view this adaption tells more of the story then you would think, in less then 100 pages."
1,johnny suede,"wanted to see this first movie of his, but the disc arrived cracked, the plastic box was fine but when opened, the disc was damaged..... maybe next time....."
4,Finally!,It's about time. I always wondered when the extremely unlikely and brilliant pairing of Brad Pitt and Nick Cave would see the light of day on dvd. Freak Storm! Need I say more?
1,Not to mention the hair,"This was really quite a deplorable little movie. The awfulness of the acting, with one exception, eclipsed even the painfulness of the concept. Brad Pitt, never very gifted as an actor, here hit rock bottom, fortunately early in his career. When I say fortunately I mean for him, not for the rest of us, who have had to endure his later somnolent roles whose dreadfulness is said, by some, to be compensated for by his abs and pretty face.I am sure this movie would have sucked out my life and left me a vegetable, except for the performance of Catherine Keener, whose brilliance as an actress has, alas, never been rewarded with the success that she deserves."
4,Suede is groovy man,"filled with great direction and sparkled together with the likable performance of Brad Pitt as Johnny Suede. Suede wants to make a band and he does but then things fall apart as he spirals into relationships and conflicts. Catherine Keener is also great. Samuel L. Jackson and Calvin Levels also star, though Jackson has a small roll as Pitt's band bass player. a great movie"
4,Good collection of Dance Music,This is a well-rounded collection of songs that are fun to dance to. Each one of the songs works well for dancing the Rhumba---the tempos are neither too slow or too fast. The songs also have a beat that is easy to feel.
4,Rumba Winner,This is a winner... with some considerable thought having gone into selecting music with the right tempo for dancing. The Peres Blanca Band isn't bad either... La Golondrina is one very nice instrumental. New ballroom dancers should have this CD.
3,Rhumba,Fair to good product. The dance selections are somewhat slow and plodding and not as suitable for a fast paced rhumba. Also each selection has been truncated at the last chord which is unsettling
3,"yes, you can dance to it","My own halting advance into the world of Latin Ballroom Dance has led me to dance-themed CDs of each of the dances my long-suffering instructor is trying to get into my movement-resistant body and soul. Though the Rhumba is my favorite dance so far, this Strictly Dancing album is the least preferred of the five or six CDs I've accumulated.Don't get me wrong. It's a perfectly serviceable project and you *can* dance to it. It won't disappoint at the leve of functionality.Neither will it light your fire. It's just not great music. But you probably aren't looking for that. If not, don't hesitate to learn Rhumba to the melodious tunes of the Peres Blanca Band. If you want a bit more aesthetic pop to your music, you might look elsewhere."
3,Decent buy for the money,"These have a clearly heard bass line, and so they are good for beginners as they struggle to hear the ""slow, quick, quick"" beat of the rumba. The last two tracks are too fast according to current competition standards.All tracks are played by the Peres Blanca Band. Judged for musicality, these rate two and a half to three stars, with the exception of the second track. This is a very danceable recording of ""Strangers in Paradise.""Here are the titles, durations, and tempos:1. Bali Ha'I, 2:24 (25 bpm)2. Stranger In Paradise, 2:43 (26 bpm)3. How Deep Is Your Love, 3:17, (27 bpm)4. Perfidia, 2:25 (28 bpm)5. Sweet Dreams, 2:04 (28 bpm)6. I Just Called To Say I Love You, 3:46 (28 bpm)7. Venus, 2:51 (28 bpm)8. Night And Day, 2:41 (29 bpm)9. Amor Do Verano, 1:53 (29 bpm)10. Yellow Bird, 2:13 (29 bpm)11. La Golondrina, 2:49 (30 bpm)12. Song For Guy, 3:50 (31 bpm)"
5,My best CD,"This is larry Willis Masterpiece. Perfect solos, perfect music. I'm very happy, that now released on CD."
3,Underrated Alice!,Alice's performance is nothing short of powerful--it's seriously sick rock at its best. Alice manages to imprint his nightmarish signature mark in an album that is clearly underrated. He absolutely ROCKS in this album!
3,Missed opportunity,Not having all the tracks of the MCA years I wonder why it has been released. MCA should have put Constrictor and Raise Your Fist And Yell and The Billion Dollar Live Track (all together only 70 minutes) on this cd. Then it has been really worth buying. But if you want 40 minutes of straight hard rock this is the album to buy.
4,A solid album,This album is fairly good and a worthwhile buy. It has several good songs and is definitely worth this online price.
2,"Unlike any other Alice, and not in a good way.","Fans of either the ""classic"" Alice Cooper (Billion Dollar Babies, School's Out) or the newer stuff (Trash, Last Temptation) should consider leaving this selection on the shelf. It's watered-down, overproduced (lots of sythnesizers and electronic drums), and lacking much of the edge and wit present on just about any other Alice album."
5,A wonderful collaboration for the soul...,"This CD with its wide variety of muscians, ranging from Tibet, to Douglas P. have put together a most memorable experience for the wandering ear. You are eloquently broadcasted into a sea of blissful insomnia while listening to this CD. I would recommend it to any and all...."
5,A must have,"This is a wonderful Current 93 album (technically a side project but it's it's all the same artists doing to same style). I'd actually say it's my favorite released from their acoustic years, and a few of the songs on here truly are gems, actually every track David Tibet sings on is golden. Bonewhiteglory is my favorite Current 93 song of all time. Any Current 93 fan who doesn't get this album is missing out, and even at the rarity and high price this album has now become, is still a worthy buy."
5,great wreck divers guide,"This book has a ton of info on hundereds of dive sites in the great lakes! Primarily focuses on the fascinating wrecks that can be found in the lakes.Major sites have a small blurb about the history of the wreck and a small black/white picture or map/drawing. LORAN location and lats and lons. Suggested dive profiles.All sites have a depth and suggested experience level for the dive and a brief discription. Sites are grouped together by location and international borders are ignored - great for both US and Canadian divers! Some info about dive operators and accomodations to certain areas.Overall, an excellent resource! I'll never be able to dive all the interesting sites in one lifetime. Provides enough info to spark a desire to explore the site but doesn't give too much away."
4,Harry Bosch doing his thing.,"MC is a great storyteller. He knows how to build the plot in aWay that the reader can follow and he keeps it interesting without letting it get too complicated. He ties everything together well and does not introduce a lot of unimportant characters for the reader to try to keep track of. Harry Bosch is a believable, fully developed character, and he lives by a highly developed code of conduct. I have read every Harry Bosch novel that I could find and will continue to do so."
5,City of Bones,"I love anything Michael Connelly writes, but especially like the Harry Bosch mysteries.. a product of the 60's and a bit of a rebel myself, he is a man after my own heart. The mysteries are well written and keep you on your toes. My only problem; I have read so many of the Harry Bosch novels, I am beginning to figure out who done it!!"
4,"Good, But Not His Best","In this ninth outing for Harry Bosch, the Los Angeles detective finds himself investigating the discovery of a child's skeleton in the hills of Hollywood.In true Connelly fashion, things aren't always what they seem, and one set of clues doesn't necessarily lead to another. I love this character, and found the most interesting aspect of this particular book how the case affected him. However I didn't find it to be the taut, tension driven narrative that I think is so prevalent in his first five books. To me nothing since has topped them for their sheer heart pounding plots. Still it's definitely worth reading especially if you're a fan of Harry."
1,"Disappointing, utterly disappointing","I've generally liked the Bosch series, having read 3 earliers ones. This one, however, is forced and very unbelievable. What is it about a middle-aged detective that makes a beautful young police woman throw herself at him? And then of course she gets killed on the job right before Bosch's eyes. Total crap. Lazy work here. Try the earlier ones."
2,Feh!,"What are you people raving about? Pedestrian, lazy writing, dictated on the run to the next story conference."
3,Why do it to yourself?,"I am astonished at early enthusiasm for this book. Granted it's well plotted and very well written. Michael Connelly is an established author, and for good reason. But THIS book is a dreadful downer. Terrible things have happened in the case Harry Bosch is investigating. Terrible things happen in the course of the investigation. The future looks bleak indeed.I'm not one to avoid all unpleasantness in my reading, but this unmitigated pessimism does not constitute recreational reading in my view. Consider yourself warned!"
4,Michael Connelly: Licensed to Thrill !,"Mr Connelly simply doesn't know how to write a bad book. I've read 'em all and his latest is up to his usual lofty standards.The things I like about this book are pretty much the same as what I like about all his books: tight writing - no wasted passages, unbeatable procedural authenticity, steadily escalating tension and excitement, and REAL characters.I gave this 4 stars simply because I would have to leave the 5 star ratings for Concrete Blond and Blood Work - his two finest books in my opinion.Anyone who is checking out these reviews and wondering if they should try a Michael Connelly novel for the first time, listen up: I've read all of the current crop of crime writers work and Mr Connelly is the subtle master at the head of the class. Do yourself a favour and read his novels in sequence starting with the Black Echo. You will not regret it !"
2,victim of success?,"i am a great fan of michael connelly and have read all his books. this one was very disappointing. he must be getting bored with the harry bosch character, or more to the point: connelly and other writers have so mined this vein of the rogue homicide cop that nothing is left--without making some imaginative leaps that connelly is not willing or able to make, in this book at least.and why should he since the majority of readers are so uncritical, and just want more of the same?i guess this is what happens when authors become so rich and so successful, and still have contracts for four or five more novels with the same characters.by all means read any, and all, of connelly's earlier works. but not this one, or any newer ones that may come out, until we see if he really intends to return to his earlier form and make a bit of an effort."
2,"Connelly is great, Cariou not so much...","This reflects the highest rating for Connelly's brilliant plotting, deft characterizations, and fine writing, and unfortunately, the lowest rating for the reader, Len Cariou. I have read and listened to many Connelly books featuring Harry Bosch. Up til now, I have heard Dick Hill as the narrator, and he is matchless in his interpretation of Harry Bosch and all other characters on Connelly's books. I'm sure Cariou is a fine actor, but with the voice of Harry Bosch so firmly entrenched with Dick Hill, I was distracted while listening to this audio. Cariou doesn't even seem to realize that both of Harry's partners (Kiz and Edgar) are African American and instead made Edgar sound like a nasal voiced whiner. I see that most of the rest of the series (I'm following them in order) feature Cariou's voice - so I will have to think hard about continuing to listen. Very, very disappointing!"
2,L. A. in Profile,"This is a good addition to the Bosch series. Although it is not the best one of Connelly's novels, it is entertaining and captures the city of Los Angeles quite well."
3,"A good Harry Bosch novel, but not his best....","I love the characters, but this was just not quite as good as the previous ones. I still love the series and will continue to read them all."
5,HARRY BOSCH NUMBER EIGHT,"CITY OF BONES by Michael Connelly is the eighth book in the Harry Bosch series. Harry works for LAPD and is one hell of a detective. Read the books in order for a far better set of stories. Harry Bosch is a detectives detective with enough years in to walk away if he chooses. This story is about a child's murder, twenty years ago, a cols case. It is a well done story and Harry has a rookie cop as a love interest. I really enjoyed this one, hope you do. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
3,Unfinished,"I looked forward to reading Connelly's latest but was quite disappointed. I didn't buy the fact that Julia Brasher commited suicide just so that she would go down in history as a ""HERO"". I kept looking forward to the ending for the real reason she was shot. Interesting reading but could have been better."
4,I remember Harry,"I have to agree with other reviews that this is not one of Michael Connelly's tighter story lines. It felt very disjointed to me at several places. However, Harry, is as always, Harry... and has an incredible way of making the reader feel his moods and emotions. A good read though, and definitely recommended for Michael Connelly fans."
5,"hands down, awesome book.","...michael connelly writes so well, it flows very quickly, and is a great book. i couldn't stop myself from reading further and further into the book. i completely recommend this book to anyone at all. ..."
3,A serviceable detective novel. Realistic and well-written,"Like much of what Connelly writes, this novel is a realistic look at how detective work actually takes place. The plot is almost too authentic in that pointless tragedies occur, and the whole storyline is very downbeat and depressing--just like real police work. In Connolly's LAPD there are departmental politics, professional rivalries, and infighting--just like any real city police force. This is not an uplifting novel or story. Quite the contrary. The ending is realistic and plausible--not the clever ""tie all the pieces together"" ending that many detective stories culminate with. In this one, there are loose ends and dead ends. The ending is less than satisfying albeit believable.The strengths of this novel are its realism and, of course, Connelly's writing, which is always pretty good."
3,Good but not great,"I think this is the 5th Connelly book I've read. I have liked them because they have been a little bit more than just detective books to me, what I've liked is that you get a little bit more about the history of Harry Bosch every time and it keeps me going back for more.This book lacked that, it was pretty much straight detective novel for me and did little to piece together the main character.Had this been the first Michael Connelly book I've read, I would have liked it, but I don't know if I would have liked it enough to read more. Good story, nice twist, but nothing really special about it.Not his best"
4,I enjoyed it but expected more,"I agree that this book is a good story. It did keep me interested through the whole thing but it was a not so thrilling ride. I guess I was just too shocked that the end wasn't what I wanted it to be. I was let down with the ending. I'm glad I read it, but doubt I would recommend it as a *thriller* but more of a police mystery. Kind of a monotone storyline that is somewhat predictable. I felt that Bosch ran up a few too many trees for the result he got, which made it all not seem worth it. But still well written and researched."
4,Connelly is chilling!,"Against the grain and toughened by time describes Michael Connelly's detective character, Harry Bosch. Hard hit by the discovery of a young boy's skeleton in the Hollywood Hills, ""Dirty Harry"" Bosch silently sets his sights on uncovering the child's identity and tracking the cold lead of the murderer. ""City of Bones"" is a chilling story, which outlines an eerie parallel between the brutal abuse that the boy suffered during his short life and the engulfing evil that Bosch doggedly tries to purge from his beloved city.Connelly has a knack for capturing the steady pressure of a determined detective and for conveying the misery of a tragic life, cut short, never given the chance for happiness. A gripping depth of despair is revealed through Connelly's detailed narrative, which serves as a sober reminder to be grateful for a decent and happy life.Excellent writing for a haunting novel."
2,Bosch left me hanging!!,"This is my 6th or 7th Michael Connelly book since becoming ""addicted"" to his easy reads & twisted plot endings. The only one worse than City of Bones was Chasing The Dime which I left on P. 192 a couple months ago. City of Bones is, generally, the same good read but the person finally pegged as the killer in the end wss never proven to me---the most incomplete villain ever!! At the risk of invading a writer's mind, I think Detective Edgewood should have been the killer of the boy as well as the eventual ""killer"". It would have made for a more intriguing subplot with the two of them connected in a sinister, perverse way!!! lol. Chasing The Dime, a non-Bosch story, was bogged down in way too many pages of boring technological details of nanochips and patents. It did not seem to be Connelly's forte. That said, every other Connelly book has been a fun, entertaining page-turner."
5,Great Story,MIchael Connely never disappoints. I've read most of his books and Iliked all of them. Can't wait for the next one.
3,bosched again,"Not the strongest of the Harry Bosch series, but a good read nonetheless. One can't help liking the Harry Bosch character, taciturn but driven, and very fallible in his personal life. Once again the personal and the professional clash in Bosch's life. Strange that he can remain so detached and perceptive in his detective work, but such a disaster in his personal dealings. An interesting murder over 20 years old is the center of this story and Bosch has his eyes only on solving it, no matter the cost."
2,"Blah, Blah, Blah","and we're not talking about boring conversation, either. this is the first book i have read by connelly and i found it as dull and flat as a butter knife. The story was unimaginative, the characters unspired, the plot was plodding and uncaptivating and as about as suspensful as watching a game of golf.Is the publisher sure this wasn't a rejected teleplay for Matlock or Murder, She Wrote? If you want a spine tingling, look-under-the -covers story, read Truman Capote's short story (based on true facts), ""Hand Carved Coffins"" in the book, MUSIC FOR CHAMELEONS.A game of CLUE with my 5 year old nephew would have been more mysterious than this yawnfest."
2,Pointless,I had high expectations for this book but I was disappointed after reading it. The story moves at snail's pace for about half the book and then different events happen unexpectedly and rather suddenly. The ending is disappointing and leaves questions unanswered instead of clearing them up. Maybe this is the 2nd or 3rd book in the series and the author just milked the popularity and put out a soul less work instead of infusing it with a real story of substance.
3,Fizzles,"This book gets off to a really dynamic start, and sucks you in. Unfortunatly, the ending doesn't deliver as promised. I was very disappointed. There is also a sub-plot that adds nothing to the story, other than length. If you want a Michael Connelly book, pick something else, unless you have already read all his other books. At least you'll enjoy the beginning."
5,Excellent,"I loved it. Second only to Concrete Blonde. Plenty of twists, great diologue, plot and a character that gets better and better with every book."
5,Longtime Connelly fan,"It goes without saying that Harry Bosch is one of the most interesting characters to come along in a long time. Just when you think maybe you have a handle on him-surprise.I particularly liked this book because of the psychological aspect,we see more of who Harry is and what drives him.Of course, it goes without saying that the story is never dull or plodding. From the first discovery if never stops-you can't quit reading it."
1,This deserves '0' stars,"Let me start by saying that I am/was a big MC fan. I really tried to like this book and read on in the hope that the limp storyline would pick-up pace or that there would be a new twist. Unfortunately there was no revival, it just never happened. The plot drudged on to the sorry, sad and predictable ending, that inched towards towards me uncontrollably.If you are a MC fan you will read the book anyway for the same reasons that I did and also the inexplicable reviews above. Make your own mind up. For those new to MC, looking for a good read- keep on looking because it is not here.I really hope MC gets his touch back as I and am sure others are loosing interest. Where have the talents of the author of 'The Poet' gone? This latest effort is mediocre at best. Would it have gotten published if it were an unknown author? - I think not.Time to find a new read. Sorry but that's how I see it. if you don't believe me buy the book and make your own mind up..."
2,Weak story development,"This is the first book I've read in this series and will be my last. It was very interesting until the end. There were a lot of storyline off-shoots that just weren't followed through on. I read the end feeling I must have missed something. A lot of questions were left unanswered, at least in my mind. There were interesting twists in the story but they fizzled out in the end."
2,Boooorrriiinnng.,"I've read every book Connelly has written and I hate to say it, but I think he is getting VERY lazy. This book is a quick easy read, but completely unengaging. I can't believe it is getting such good reviews here. The plot ""twists"" are easy to see and not surpising. The list of suspects are completely non-threatening and don't get me started on the [less than satisfying] ending. If you want a lot better novel in the same vein, pick up Dennis Lehane (except for mystic river) or even Robert Crais (LA Requim is a masterpiece)."
2,What happened?!?,"As one who'd been waiting for the next Connelly novel with great enthusiasm, I *have* to share my disappointment. I wish I'd never read this book... it soured the taste of the whole Bosch series for me.In short, this reads like the procedural history of an authentic police case, but it's just not a case that's ""bookworthy."" No cliffhanger moments, no truly suspensful life & death struggles... there is just nothing compelling about this dusty old case, no credible justification given for the investigation's urgency or for the media frenzy, and no real sympathy created for the victim.BTW, ""The Last Coyote"" did a *much* better job of bringing an old case to life and making the pursuit of its solution truly exciting than did ""City of Bones.""Connelly's a great author, so the book is not rife with cliches... that and the fact that at least *one* character (Bosch) was well developed made it worth two stars instead of one."
3,What Might Have Been...,"While there was a lot to like about this book, the real disappointment was what might have been. It would have been so much more interesting for Harry to have to deal with the lunatic Julia was turning out to be. And the ending(s) seemed slapped on rather than thought out. If you haven't read a Harry Bosch book before, read the early ones. If you've read them all - wait for the next one."
3,city of bones,"This is one of my least favorite books with Harry Bosch as the main character. I read all of Michael connely's books and I do like Bosch, but this one is just o.k.I found it pretty repetitive and in some places I was bored with the plot. If I compare this to Nine Dragons or The last Coyote if falls short. It was an easy read so I did finish it and I do like the Harry Bosch character just not as much in this book! He seemed weak to me....he usually comes across quietly strong, he lost that in City of Bones."
4,good book,Typical Harry Bosch novel. Fast pace and easy to read. good old fashion murder mystery. I will probably read all Michael Connelly books.
2,Michael Connelly needs to take a break,"I've been following Michael Connelly since Black Echo and I'm pretty impressed with his detailed plots, fleshed-out characters and crisp writing. However, he seems to be losing his touch with City of Bones. The story started out well but faltered 2/3 of the way. You'll know who is the killer when he is introduced, so there's no surprise at the end. Harry Bosch, despite all the back cover blurbs saying it would change him forever, is still the same, the ending notwithstanding. Maybe we're getting numbed by the current CSI, The Shield, Boomtown, Law & Order assault, but then again, that's just me."
2,"City of Bones is weak, void moon is too",I have enjoyed all of Michael Connelly's books but his two most recent have been let downs. They lack the gritty excitment and kinky twists that made the Concrete Blonde or Blood Work so exciting. Is he running out of original ideas for his work? It certainly seems so as these don't compare to his first works.
2,Make no bones about it ...,"City of Bones has been put together like a skeleton - only there seems to be a few bones missing. Michael Connelly's eighth Harry Bosch title is disjointed and disappointing - a letdown from his usual brilliance evidenced in A Darkness More Than Night, Void Moon, Angels Flight, Blood Work, and The Poet. The plot sees LAPD veteran Bosch investigating the discovery of a child's skeleton, buried for 20 years. However a storyline that starts with so much promise also become buried. The characters are flimsy and the investigation, a facile victory.It seems even the usual brilliant Connelly became bored and rather than deliver his usual twists and turns, sent this story down a deadend street."
4,City of Bones,"Excellant mystery. Written by a knowledgeable man who's walked the walk. Couldn't put it down. One complaint, the author spends too much time giving street directions. Other than that I can't wait for the next book.T W Morse"
3,"Actually, 3 and a half stars","I picked this book up at the library while waiting for my wife. She was more than an hour late, so I managed to get well into this book. It's a good story, and this author, whom I had never read before, seems to handle police procedure well. At least it seems realistic to me. This story has enough twists to keep the reader interested, so I managed to finish it. It's well written. Not quite a four star job, but very good."
4,consistent creativity,"Harry Bosch and company. They will never let you down. Michael Connelly has done it again. A ""cant put down exciting read"". Plot twists, familiar characters, tough yet compassionate feelings of sincere prose that hits home. I, for one, will read Mr. Connelly's consistent creations as fast as he writes them. I have asked Amazon to flag me when ever the next offering is available."
4,"Brilliant acting in solid, but not deep, Hollywood bio-pic","An interesting and well acted mainstream bio-pic.Sissy Spacek is amazing as Loretta Lynn - all the moreso for doing her own singing (as did Beverly D'Angeloas Patsy Cline). Tommy Lee Jones shows more charmthan he's almost ever been allowed to since.But in the end, it is indeed a Hollywood bio-pic, withoutany great overriding themes or ideas, except to tell thestory of a fascinating woman's life one episode at a time.A solid film, but not a great one."
5,It's Something Special...,"It really is a special movie... one of my favorites!*Great movie- great acting- great over all!*(& not only for ""country western"" lovers...but for everyone*)"
4,Incomplete Story,"I don't know what happened, but the VHS had an incomplete story. Loretta was confiding with Patsy Cline, when the tape all of a sudden ended and rewound."
5,Stellar performances from all.,"This movie was wonderful from all aspects. Not only did it tell the story of one of Country Music's greatest stars, but it did it honestly. Sissy Spacek and Tommy Jee Jones were perfectly casted in this movie as Loretta and her husband Doolittle. Beverly D'Angelo was good as Patsy Cline as well. It was refreshing that she and Sissy sang their own songs on this film, and that there weren't dubbed over voices. Sissy Spacek is one of the best actresses to come along in my lifetime and certainly Coal Miner's Daughter was one of her finest performances. A must have for any serious film collector."
1,Wrong formatting,The DVD is not formatted to be run at a Playstation 3 here in Norway. I cannot watch the movie!
3,changshow,An interesting take on a historical subject. Well acted and scripted. Good movie for country music fans.
4,The First Lady of Country Music...,"An AMAZING performance by Sissy Spacek, solid direction by Michael Apt and great supporting performances by Tommy Lee Jones and Beverly D'Angelo make this film a modern classic. Spacek and D'Angelo sing in their own voices and bring their characters to life. A well earned oscar went to Spacek, but lets not forget the earnest performance by a then unknown Tommy Lee Jones as Dolittle Lynn. He has the modivation and mindset of his character and drives this movie from the sidelines, I am very partial to this movie mainly because my grandmas house is briefly in the movie. Also, the music is awesome, a history of country music. Great cameos by Grand Ole Opry legends just add to the honesty and earnestness of this film. This movie introduced me to country music and was country when country wasn't cool."
3,For lovers of Country,"Perhaps just for those for whom Country is their musical soul. Sissy Spacek does a great job portaying the career of one of CM's legends, Lorretta Lynn. Probably leaving out some of more difficult parts of Lynn's life, the movie concentrates on an historical overview making it more predictable than necessary. Notwithstanding I found it entertaining and nostalgic. I had seen the movie before but only realised during this viewing that spacek does all the singing. Such a fantastic job that made me wonder why she didn't make CM her career."
5,Video Tape of Coal Miner's Daughter,"The video got here really fast, in like-new condition. This is my favorite movie, and my husband got it for me for Mother's Day! Very Happy! Thanks!"
5,stupendous,Had it in VHS and decided I needed to upgrade. There is nothing about this movie that I don't love.
5,"An entry worthy of immortality, ignored by Western Critics","We have lingered too long on the so-called, and now closed, canon of Western literature. Reading this one gets, curiously, reminded of Joyce and the Dos Passos of USA, with the bewildering set of references. This is brlliant; a must read that puts many of our western classics in the shade."
4,Great starter set,"I bought this set to try model railroading as a hobby. It was inexpensive and small making it perfect for my needs. When I received it I took it out of the box and had it up and running within 10 minutes, no problems at all. Nothing has fallen apart, I've moved the train and track countless times knocking them over and nothing has been damaged. I went ahead and weathered the train with charcoal and matte clear coat and now it looks like a real used locomotive. I'm now working on my carved-foam 30""x30"" layout, and since this little bachmann set has done so well I'm thinking of purchasing another small set from them to do another little model.note: I personally would not suggest this for a kid under the age of 10-12. The super tiny scale makes it hard to work with and not so pretty to look at. I would suggest HO scale or even O scale."
4,Great Starter Set,"Pros:1. Great set to start with2. Easy to set up3. Comes with a good length train4. Everything is scaled perfectly5. The E-Z track is great for new model railroaders6. The power supply is even throughout the whole track, and with more track added on7. The engine works perfectlyCons:1. The caboose coupling is not attached to the wheel truck, and therefore comes out easily on winding track2. The coal carrier did not come with a coupling attached. I had to take the coupling from the back of the caboose and put it on the coal carrier3. The engines couplings are higher than the rest of the carsOverall, I think this is a good set, especially if you get more track with it. If you are planning to get more track with it, you should know that the E-Z track is perfectly compatible with standard N-scale track. Have fun railroading!"
1,"doesn't work,no warrantee service.","had it 10 plus days, been trying since day 1 to get a responce from bachman about bad power track , no luck. calls and e-mail no responce . buy this train for kids xmas , they can always play with the box.guess i can disassemble their EZ track and solder the connections to track as problem seems to be the connection from spades on track to the rails. just what i needed more things to do with the time i just don't have."
2,it was broken when i got it,it was broken when i got it the transforn is too week and i can only use it for show.
2,"Doesn't fit a 12"" mattress, never mind 17""","I have a 9-year old mattress that's around 9"" thick, topped with a 3"" memory foam topper. I bought this mattress pad because it was advertised as fittign up to 17"" mattress. This is a crock. Every morning I have to re-seat the corners of the pad because they've slipped out from the bottom of the mattress just due to normal tossing and turning at night. Putting the thing on after a washing is a struggle, and there's always at least one corner ready to pop loose.This pad is cheap for a reason. Shop elsewhere if you have an extra-thick mattress and need a pad that will fit it well."
1,Doesn't Fit as Advertized,"While this looks to be a good quality product, this pad does not fit our mattress. According to Amazon.com, this pad will fit mattresses up to 17"" deep. It won't. In fact, the packaging claims only to fit ""any mattress up to 15 inches"" deep."
2,SRC fades away with psychedelic era,"As the psychedelic era faded away at the dawn of the '70s, SRC was a band without a sound. Traveler's Tale, their third album, was not quite psychedelic, not quite progressive, not quite commercial...it's a tepid album in search of a musical personality. It also suffers from the absence of Gary Quackenbush on lead guitar, who left after two albums and was replaced by less-talented guitarist Ray Goodman.The album was also poorly produced, with a muddy sound further clouding the murky musical waters. This was their final shot on a major label (Capitol). Their two previous albums (SRC and Milestones) are much preferred over this one."
3,Perhaps I should've asked for the MUSICtrack!,"I must say that if I want to hear the dialog of the movie, I rent the movie!If I want to hear the music in the movie, I buy the soundtrack! Unfortunately, that's not what David Holmes had in mind, and there is way too much of the actual script laid over the songs on this soundtrack. Not that it's bad dialog...this is an excellent movie. But if you just want to get into the music, don't get this soundtrack. In fact, the songs and the dialog don't even match the chronology of the movie. For example, ""It's your Thing"" did NOT play during the robbery scene.Great music, though....I think I'll go look for the Isley Brothers on CD now."
3,Great mix of funk and retro sounds with oldies,"True, the use of dialog is fascinating at first, but gets old. But the music in this soundtrack! Great! Makes you wanna dance in the car. Upon repeated listens, I see that there are several musical styles here, but they ALL compliment each other very well. Some great instrumentals that you have never heard before, but which grow on ya."
2,Dialogue ruins this CD,"A great movie with a wonderful score is sold short with this dialogue riddled fiasco. Whoever made the decision to have talking, and radio tuning at the head of various tracks owes a heartfelt apology to David Holmes (Composer). Mr. Holmes inspired score is humiliated by chatter, and various creative tinkerings by, I suspect, the pasty fingers of a musical fool."
4,Black Beauty - An Exceptional Tale,"I really loved this book because it teaches many good lessons, like patience and willingness to work hard. This horse's life is filled with good times and bad, kind masters and cruel masters. The way Black Beauty loves and tries to do his best for all his masters shows his humble spirit and his need to be loved. He goes through whatever hardship comes his way and his trust in his grooms and his masters is lovely. To hear him speak of how he must do his best in everything and always be good and patient is really heart-warming, and though he is a horse, a very timid and human spirit lives within him. He often speaks of how silly and stupid things like check-reigns and blinkers are and how ignorant certain foolish people can be. He knows that not all people are like that and tries to not show his despair when an amateur is in control. He is truly pious soul and in him I saw the qualities that make a creature beautiful, not only on the outside but on the inside too."
4,A delightful version of the best horse story of all time,"This version of Black Beauty is full of whimsical illustrations in color and drawings throughout the chapters. The little pony, Merrylegs, is a delight.Black Beauty's human aquaintances are created with character and personality. I have 17different copies of Black Beauty. And this one is high on my list. By Claire."
1,Black Beauty,"This ""collector"" version is far too small. Looks like a dime novel. I'm in the process of locating a full-sized version for my 7 year old granddaughter.Would not recommend purchase of this book."
2,Quit Less than a Third of the Way Through,"Every third page is a sermon on how to treat animals with respect. I got the point by the fifth time time around. The 10th through the 20th sermons were tad bit tiresome. Not sure how this book ever became known as a classic. I've never seen the movie, but it must be better than this book. Time to read more E.B. White, C.S. Lewis, Astrid Lindgren, Roald Dahl, etc. for bedtime stories. I quit reading this less than a third of the way through."
3,This Classic lost a lot on the recorded version!,"Having read the book, ""Black Beauty"" seemed to lose a lot of charm and warmth when told on the audio version.Still the same, great horse with incredible feelings and sensitivity, -- still the same first person narrative, -- but somehow I felt I was losing the tremendous input that pictures can provide.Always the children's classic, always a great story, Black Beauty on tape was not my favorite forum for this timeless story. If I had the choice, I would definitely read the book and show the pictures to children for their fullest enjoyment and appreciation of a wonderful, black horse...Black Beauty."
1,Wrong ISBN,We needed a certain ISBN book number to replace worn books from a classroom set. The cover and ISBN number didn't match what was shown on the site.
3,Literary Analysis of Black Beauty by: Anna Sewell,"Literary Analysis of Black Beauty by: Anna Sewell In this classic story about a beautiful thoroughbred horse Black Beauty goes through good and bad times, good and bad masters.{Sewell uses many sentences about the story , to make it more interesting. She also uses literary devices to understand exactly what the story was about.} The story was a major part in this story."
4,Black beauty,This book was a very good book! I rated it a four out of five because I think it needed more action. I recommend it to horse lovers!
4,Black Beauty Review,"I'm not done reading it yet, but this was my absolute favorite childhood book. I agree with another reviewer who said that because some of the words have been changed, the story is not quite like I remembered, and thus a bit less enjoyable, than if it had been the original. However, it is close enough to the original that I do give it a 4 star rating."
4,Neat,I really love this book. But in the end I am really sad because ginger dies. And for merrylegs. But overall a fantastic book.
5,Black Beauty,"This story is told from the perspective of the horse, and is enlightening about how it must feel to have to pull a cart that is too heavy, or to have a painful bit in one's mouth. Things that people take for granted are approached from Beauty's point of view. This is a good book for readers of all ages."
1,Do Not Buy This Book!,"This book is just plain boring and useless. it lacks any kind of climax and its ""action"" scenes are still boring and serve no real purpose. Save your money for a real novell! Anyone who likes horses might partially care about the main character, but otherwise you'll find yourself wishing he was dead so you could stop reading it! The character has no flare of personality and is your basic stupid goody-two-shoes.Any real book the characters have flaws. Of course, this book is lousy and the characters are just boring. I have consulted several others and we all agree on one point: its a total waste of money, time, and effort. This book somehow managed to become a classic, proboble just because it has to do with horses. It has no plot! There really must be better ways to spend your time than read this book! This so-called novel deserves a -999999999 rating."
3,Black Beauty,"This book is brill it made me cry laugh and somtimes even jump up and down! It's about a horse that has a number of adventures and it discribes all his friends on the way. If you are looking for a book that makes you laugh and cry, this has to be it!"
4,A book forever,"I read this book for the first time when I was 12. I still love it, and I still cry when I read it. No, it is not the best crafted book I have ever read. But it still teaches us great things about love, and caring, and fate and suffering. I can't wait my daughter to grow up for us to read ""Black Beauty"" together."
3,Know what you're in for,"This is a classic and I wouldn't dissuade anyone from reading it if they want. This review is just a warning that this is not a happy book! As a kid I saw the movie, and all I remembered was a scene where Black Beauty was happy and running free. Apparently that was just at the beginning of the book! It's beautifully written and really grabs you as a reader, but if you're a compassionate animal lover and expecting a happy book a beautiful animal and his happy life, you'll want to put this book down."
4,A WELL-RECEIVED GIFT,"This was one of my favorite books when I was a child & my 8-year-old cousin was delighted when I gave it to her. However, though a wonderful story, I was a little disappointed that there were no illustrations. For young children, I think they're almost necessary."
4,An amazing classic!,"This book was great! I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants a classic tale, with a really original idea. It was really amazing to read about the different hardships Black Beauty had to face during his lifetime, and to realise the cruel treatment that a lot of horses had to endure during the times when everyone used horse and carriage to get around. I thought this was a very powerful novel, and you don't have to be a horse-lover to enjoy it. There wasn't a single boring bit in it! An amazing read!"
5,this book teaches you a good way to horse back ride,This book is a good classic and it tells you about how a horse would like you to ride it. And it gives you a bit of history. It was written by Anna Seawell who had been crippled in a riding accident. She didn't let this scare her and decided to help other learn to ride properly.
1,A nice book,"I really like this book , it is very sweet and I love the story and it is narrated by the horse"
5,My favorite book!,This book is a very good book! I enjoyed it very much. And horse lover or non-horse lover would love this book. I've read this book and seen the movie-they are both great. I would recommend this book to you. If you wanna know more-just read this book. And I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did.
5,WOW,this book is just stunning and anyone who rates this book below five stars is just wrong. It teaches people of all ages multiple lessons.
4,Black Beauty,It has yet to arrive.I read it as a child and was astonished at its educational features: of the times it was written in; it also appears to be THE foundation book for the many current views of animals. It encourages every reader to perceive animals are also living beings who suffer a good deal.Anna Sewell died before her work was published. I wish she knew how much it would change the world.
1,childs book,"was not aware of who the author was. but i remeber this book from my childhood, and many others recommended reading it. but it was too childish for my tastes in literature. i didnt even finish reading it."
5,WOW!! What a great book,Black Beauty by Anna Sewell is a story written from a horse's point of view and it is an excellent story. The main character of the book is a beautiful black horse named Black Beauty who tells his life story. At different points in the book it was quite sad...but it was mostly happy. The reader is able to see what the life of a horse is like. I strongly recommend this book to readers of all ages because it is a heart-warming tale. Thank you for taking the time to read my review.
1,Terrible Purchase,"I got it for $14.93 with shipping and gift wrap. I'm pissed at Amazon for ripping me off. This book is only 3"" x 5"". The price of $7.95 is printed on the inside cover. The wrapping was cheap paper with a machine ribbon, no bow. The gift card was glued flat to the ribbon. This is a sham. The owners and managers of Amazon should be punished. Me too for being so stupid. That's what Amazon takes me for, stupid. I deserve this crappy book. Oh yeah, I can return it. Yeah pay more money and waste more time. I'll take my loss. I was gonna save me a real life trip to the bricks and mortar Barnes & Noble store...Amazon not anymore. At least on Ebay you expect to be ripped off. On EBAY you take your chances and hope. You count on EBAY's ratings being a lie. Amazon you lost my business. Send me a $50 no strings gift card and I'll forgive you."
3,free kindle version - Black Beauty,"Being a classic there is no need to review the story, I think.Like so many of the Amazon free classics, this book is not really optimised for an ereader. The table of contents does not link to the chapters, each new chapter begins in mid page and the chapter heading is in plain text so the whole thing feels like one massive block of text. Granted, it is free, so one should not complain, but it seems like Amazon is missing out on an opportunity here.However, in the end I opted for the Project Gutenberg version [gutenberg.org] which is also free and much more attractive in layout and formatting."
2,Very few Illustrations can make this a tough read for youngsters,I was disappointed in this edition of the classic for children. It's a story from another time and very hard for some children to visualize. Illustrations would help mightily in reading this worthwhile classic.
5,Great book!,This is the unabriged version of Black Beauty. Beauty is born to a kind farmer in England. He is sold to a rich family. He is sold frequently for a few years and meets many new horses. He is finally bought by a kind cabbie and lives happily for a few years. He is sold again and is nearly killed . he is bought again by his first owners and lives the rest of his life peacefully.
4,a nice classic,"I love horses, and I saw the movie and liked it. The book is fine, but it has no climax, and the main character, Black Beauty seems to be slightly ignorant of the world around him."
5,The best book to teach Love & Compation!!!!!!,"This book was very good and at times sad.It was quite moving as well.If you are looking for a classic for kids,you have hit the jackpot!!!!!:)"
5,"THIS IS A GREAT BOOK , A DEFINATE MUST BUY!",This is a compelling book about a hores life a must reed for any animal lover. This book allows you to see an animals perspective of life.
2,Black Beauty,I wasn't impressed. I guess I started to read it when I was younger and didn't finish. I felt like I was reading a manual on how to treat or not to treat a horse. But maybe it's just that I don't care for animals much.
5,classic story for all ages.,"I first read this book when I was about ten. Now 52 I have just read it for the third time, never get fed up of the story. Well written, sad in places with a happy ending."
5,"Captivating story of experiences, knowledge and triumph...","This is an expanded edition of the book first published in 1935, in which the author re-counts his desert experiences in pursuit of knowledge of the Arabian horse. He later used what he learned to become a principal agent in building up the breed in the United States and Europe in the 20th century. Traveling in the Arabian Peninsula shortly before the founding of Saudi Arabia in 1932, Raswan was renowned among the tribes for his deep respect of Bedouin ways, especially horsemanship and horse breed-ing. Born in Dresden in 1893, he emigrated to the United States in 1921, where he as-sisted in the historic Davenport importation and with the establishment of the country's earliest Arabian stud farms. This edition contains 100 pages of photographs. DD"
4,Truth often greater than fiction,"Some fiction writers are dying for the structure that will set them apart from the others. Their books are crafted around an outline, a chronology, or an intuition. A story must evolve, a character must draw the reader in. If in structure only, this narrative changes the way you will read fiction. The stories, the chronology, and the manner of which they are used, create an atmosphere that engulfs the reader, teaches the reading mind that life, when witnessed and retold well, is more beautiful than fiction; a new mythology of truth is born. This book is a keystone to perceiving life, and living, as each day is a myth being told, and that all travels will bring us to tales of morality, love, and the sweet heart-ache of departure and return."
2,No wonder the third world is a wreck...,"...if this is what passes for entertainment. The premise has been adapted from the same source material as 'Man on Fire.' It maintains a modest connection to that source but goes into moments of silliness, i.e. playing 'kung fu fighting,' during a fight scene. I fell asleep on this thing. Thought it would never end.Read the book."
5,"The best ""Carl"" book","If you're going to get one ""Carl"" book, make it this one! We had originally borrowed this from the library and it was such a favorite of our 18-month old girl that we bought it. We have since given way to buying more Carl, but this one is the best.As usual, there are very few words, but the pictures are particularly beautiful in this book as Carl takes baby to a masquerade party. The expressions on the baby's face (and the dog's, for that matter!) are captured magnificently. This would make my top 5 of books I've read to my daughter."
3,Not up to Carl's standards!,"We loved our first Carl books, ""Good Dog, Carl!"" and ""Carl's Afternoon in the Park."" So, I bought several more Carl books from Amazon without previewing them. Imagine my disappointment that these books did not maintain the excellent quality provided by the first two. This book does not flow as smoothly as those forementioned. The artwork is a little more sketchy (still better than most children's books). There are some clever ideas in the book, but it is too busy to maintain a child's interest. I definitely recommend the two other books mentioned, but use caution and preview any other Carl books before purchasing them."
1,UltraLast 2CR5 Battery,Very poor quality. Each battery only lasted for about 5 pictures. I will never buy from this supplier.Pat Landers
1,zero stars for UltraLast 2CR5 lithium battery,"As soon as I opened the package, I tested the battery's charge on my home tester, which indicated a weakly charged battery; I then took it to a camera store for testing, and found that this brand new battery had only about a 40% charge - not what you want in your camera when out in the field."
1,easy to break boom and ear connector,"Having owned two of the Body Glove Earglove Headsets, I would not purchase another one. Both of mine broke after a few weeks of use. Either the boom snapped off or the ear connector broke off where the boom connects to the headset. I'm very careful with my cell phone and related items, handling each with care. Poor design."
2,"Great for listening, not for talking","I found the earpiece, which is adjustable, to be comfortable and clear sounding. However, in conversations with others on the phone (and test messages to myself), I was barely audible at a normal conversational volume to both the other party on the line and voicemail.It seems to me that the microphone (which supposedly features noise canceling) is either too short for its intended purpose or is not sensative enough. I recommend another product that allows you to hear and to be heard."
2,This thing sucks,"I don't like this thing at all. It's painful to wear -- the speaker is like a big round hard knob which doesn't squeeze well into my un-knoblike ear. Maybe if they made the speaker have a more comfortable shape it would work well, but it kills me right now. I also spend forever trying to get it on. At any rate, I prefer the Ericsson hands-free where it's just a soft earpiece you can just stick in your ear without any fumbling."
3,Uncomfortable,"Easy to use, hasn't broken on me yet. The one thing that bothered me is that it's uncomfortable in the ear after more than a 5 minute conversation. The sound and clarity is pretty good, but I would go with something else next time."
5,Best one I have used,"I love this headset ... it works great, have not had any major problems with it, or people complaining that they cannot hear me. The only problem is that when you are driving, the wind from the open windows does hamper it somewhat, but other than that, no complaints!"
2,"Good looks, poor performance","I bought this item because of it's looks and also because I have several Body Glove items. BUT, the earpiece do not fit right in my ear, it constantly drops out, the so called button to answer/end calls won't work on my Motorola Vulcan. The only thing I think it's OK is in the sound subject, I can clearly hear and they can clearly hear me."
2,Poor construction,This product was the best I've owned when it comes to staying in the ear and sound quality but the earpiece came apart after a few weeks. I was going to buy another but this has happened to too many people.
2,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!,There's got to be a better solution. The earpiece is fine. The microphone is awful. Period.
2,not very durrable,"out of the box it worked great, but within 60 days of use the microphone no longer worked. so now its on to another brand.."
1,Disappointing,This headset is designed for infants. The microphone is so short that it sounds like you are speaking from miles away (only an infant's face is small enough to talk directly into this microphone). I had to talk to the side of my face for the other side to hear what I was saying. Don't waste your money!!!!
2,Not really worth it...,I really wouldn't buy this product unless you like the pretty colors.It really is worthless unless you plan to use them in church to speak to your priest in the next confessional.Not for high performance business use...but if you need something that will perform and can get knocked around at the beach its worth it.
2,A Painful Experience!,"I puchased this for the reason that; it hooked around your ear and, it had a small boom microphone which, I though would perform better than my Jabra earset. Unfortuately, I was wrong.Sound quality was pretty good but, in order to achieve that quality you have to get the earpiece firmly in your ear. This is where my pain came in! The hard earpiece had to be lodged in my ear in such a way that, after about five to ten minutes, I had to take it out because of discomfort. While I did use it I tested the microphone by leaving myself voice mail messages both at home and on my cell phone. The sound quality was poor. If I couldn't even understand the message I left myself, that's pretty poor.Overall, I could not recomend this for the reasons mentioned above. Save your money and, look elsewhere and, let me know if you find someting good!"
2,flawed design & quality,"The design was flawed at best. It fell apart within 45 days, the ear piece came apart, the wiring became exposed at the earpiece, and the sound was lost soon after. The sound was mediocre. The only positive thing about it was the fact that it didn't fall off your ear. It really was a waste of my $$$$."
5,FINALLY! A COMFORTABLE headset that DOESN'T FALL OUT!!,"So far, I have bought 5 different kinds of headsets to use with cell/cordless phones. The BODY GLOVE EARGLOVE is fantastic! At first I was doubtful because of the brightcolored interchangable ""neosleeve"" covers..( I assumed it was a product geared towards kids & therefore COMFORT was probably low on the list) Was I surprised! Earphone and mic has better quality sound than my other fav plantronics. It truely ""fits like a glove"" is extremely liteweight & COMFORTABLE and most important of all: IT DOESNT FALL OUT WHEN YOU TURN YOUR HEAD! Highly RECOMMENDED. [Now, if only they would design headset that fits my siemens cordless....] only works with 2.5 jacks...NOKIA 5190 etc."
1,Not for Nokia 8260,"Do not buy this particular product if you have a Nokia 8260. The jack fits mechanically, but not electrically. The result is that the volume to the earpiece is so low it is unusable. Body Glove makes a version specifically for the Nokia 8260, but it is not yet offered by .... ... is now aware of this and no longer recommends this model for the Nokia 8260."
1,Where's The Irish Music?,"This group is from Ireland but they aren't singing any Irish music, just""New Age"" music that gets quite boring."
2,"Average,Low-Budget B-Movie","The 4th chapter deals with Leprechaun in space and he kills soldiers on a spaceship and wants his bride.The special effects are cheap and old-fashioned,the acting is so dreadful that this makes the Plan 9 from Outer Space actors look professional,the production values are so thin that TV commercials look like they have higher production values,and the dialogue is so laughable that it looks like a 5 year-old wrote their lines,but this is an average B-Movie that you and others can laugh at and make fun of.Just rent this and don't buy it just buy part 2 and 3."
1,Awful,"This is quite possibly the worst movie in the history of film making. I began thinking to myself, ""No way could this get ANY worse"", but to my suprise, it did. I'm not quite sure how this movie was funded, seeing that the 3rd Leprechaun movie would surly be enough to drive the producers into bankruptcy, but somehow, a few dollars were scrapped up to pay for horrible effects and no name actors. I have just been informed a 5th Leprechaun movie was also made...why? If you are looking to waste an hour and a half of your time, please do something other than watch this movie."
5,The Pinnacle of the Leprechaun Series - 10 stars off the Chart!,"This the best Leprechaun Show ever and unfortunately the last good Lep flick. Lep in the Hood is just plain stupid. None of the Leprechaun movies were ever scary except perhaps the very first one. I think when the producers realized the comedy potential of the Leprechaun Series they just kept making each movie funnier until they exhausted the idea with the totally flat ""Leprechaun in the Hood"". I laughed so hard I couldn't breath when the space marine took a leak on the Leprechauns body only to later give birth to to the wise cracking Leprechaun via his own urethra! That's comedic genius to tenth power! It just keeps getting better. I tell everyone about this movie. The two best Lep movies are w/o a doubt Leprechaun in Las Vegas and Leprechaun in Space."
2,Damnit it's leprechaun..... not star wars!,"Ok... when i first rent the movie.... i tought: Oh god, this is going to suck! And i was right! They dont even call him a leprechaun, they call him an alien! If you hated What they did to Jason in ""Jason X"" you will hate that movie too!Worst Leprechaun ever!"
2,Aliens for everybody,"In the future of man kind, the leprechaun has become something of a threat to human existence. He hijacks a space craft to catch a spoiled princess and kill some dumb jocks with guns. Their only hope is the ship's female doctor and any member of the crew with a brain. Starts off well for a space movie with a refreshingly calm performance by the leprechaun. But the whole film goes to hell fast as it fails to use anything new to keep our attention focused. The viewer is left pretty happy to see it end."
2,Warwick Davis,"Having turned into a horror franchise, this fourth offering in outer space has little to offer other than a brief nude scene. I would not recommend it."
2,Mindless and Low-Budget,"In all honesty, I love the leprechaun movies. The first was so funny and Jennifer Aniston was a riot. But this movie was terrible. It probobly had the lowest budget of the 5. The sets were stupid and unrealistic and the acting was terrible. Especially be Rebecca Carlton, the princess. This movie was also really not well written and had no clever death scenes at all. The movie was simply pointless and oh yeh, the special effects... were even worse. Avoid this movie at all costs..."
3,Funny as usual,"Oh, come.. You can't expect much from the Leprechaun but.. he's in space. That's gotta be funny! I mean, the whole's not that great but watching his antics and his haikus is always worth the money. He's like Chucky but talks more."
1,THIS IS JUST SHAMEFUL,"THIS IS WHERE THINGS STARTED TO GET REALLY BAD. THIS TIME, THE LEPRECHAUN CAUSES TERROR ABOARD A SPACE SHIP. THE PLOT ISN'T TOO GOOD, MOST OF THE KILLINGS IS BORING, AND THE MOVIE BORDERS ON BEING UNWATCHABLE. VERY STUPID AND VERY UNNECCESARY. YOU MIGHT WANNA SKIP THIS ONE IF YOU WANNA SEE A GOOD LEPRECAHUN MOVIE."
1,WORST MOVIE I HAD EVER SEEN,"The worst movie I have ever seen is Caress of the Vampire, which may not even qualify as movie, more like attempted vampire porn. However, before I saw that crap, my worst movie spot was definitely this one. I loved Leprechaun 1 and 2, didn't like 3, and HATED this one. It's so bad, but it's not funny bad, it's just... bad. The horrible production is the only thing even slightly entertaining. The space planet looks like cardboard and you can see the duct tape hanging off the space suits. It's so stupid, not funny, and just plain horrible. But if you want to see the whole series, this is one of them... so you are forced to watch this one too. Hopefully ""Hood"" will be better."
1,ohhhhhhhhhh,"ohhhhhhh, now the frickin leprechaun is in space. oh, ok. how the crap did he get there. with no good acting and a surprisingly funny bit involving a lightsaber, which is the only good thing, this one is a total flop of a movie in a floppy franchise. you also get to see the leprechaun grow enormous then he checks out his huge sausauge. what a waste."
1,"Arguably worse than ""Plan 9""","Not really, but it's close. This time, Willow the Leprachuan lands in space. The movie doesn't tell you why or how (and frankly, no one cares) and proceeds to be a low-budget horror which isn't scary, but funny, sometimes unintentionally but not often enough unintentionally enough to make it worth a bad movie fan's time. Most pathetic moment: the nude scene. Basically an alien takes her top off; ""Look upon them as you ponder the remainders of your worthless little lives."" or something to that effect. Justification: ""When (this alien race) shows you their breasts, it's a death sentence."" ugh. Watch for the Leprachuan (noted for being tiny) balloon up to about 50 feet at the climactic end. Hopefully this ended the series."
3,Where is the CD?,"After reading the job description, I assumed that this book came with a CD loaded with sample policies. Yet when I received it, it was only a book. So beware - if you want some sample policies on a CD, this is not the book for you."
3,sticky post it,"I bought these for my daugther school teacher, just for appreciation and I will say it is ok because when she sticks notes on my daughter books she still used tape to stick the sticky pads."
2,Hungarian Folk : 50s-60s Style,"In spite of the fetching picture of the Bulgarian ladies on the cover, this CD contains traditional Hungarian Folk music by the group Maros.The style tend more towards the restaurant-operetta rather than the later raw peasant-y emphasis of the Tanchaz movement of the 70s. Vocalists are backed by an orchestra that includes a cimbalom. Overall the songs are pleasantly produced and the vocals easily discernable. Songs include ""Piros Kancso, Piros Bor"", ""Repulj Madar"" and ""Egy Szem Buza, Egy Szem Rosz"" among others."
5,Knows his stuff,"This Dr really knows the body! He truly understands the blending of Eastern and Western medicine, philosophy and long term benefits of yoga practice. I use this book as a constant reference as a certified yoga teacher.Thank you for such a wonderful resource!"
2,"One great segment, but that's it","There is only one reason to buy this film--the second vignette, ""Anger."" It is the funniest twenty minutes of film I have ever seen. Andrew ""Dice"" Clay is at his ranting raunchy best, getting off some of the best one-liners I've heard in ages. I've shown this to people who despise Dice, and they've howled. The rest of the film droops in comparison, despite excellent casting. The powers that be should have saved me some wear and tear on my VCR and put ""Anger"" first, because it's the only segment worth watching, believe me."
4,Wowiee!!! I'm #1!!!,"I'm the first person to review this! Am I the only one who saw it before? Favorite Deadly Sins is one of the funniest Lampoon movies, and definetely one of the best Lampoon made-for-cable movies. Divided into 3 segments Greed, Anger, and Lust, it features a HUGE celebrity cast: Joe Mantegna, Andrew ""Dice"" Clay, Denis Leary, Robert Culp, Brian Keith (Uncle Bill!), Ed Marinaro, Pia Zadora, William Ragsdale (Manniquien 2), Charlene Tilton, and one of my favorite actors, Gerrit Graham. Greed is the longest, starring Joe Mantegna as a TV producer who gets a waitress to kill her abusing family so he can turn it into a TV movie and ending with a great musical number. Anger stars Andrew ""Dice"" Clay as a man who has to go buy tampons for his wife, and ends up being killed. Lust stars Denis Leary as a security guard who falls in love with the babe who's in the window across from him. Very funny; I recommend it."
3,Neither good or bad but mildly entertaining,"As my title indicates, this movie doesn't leave a large impression either way. It wasn't a complete flop but didn't make it to the must have category either. The movie did contain a few mildly amusing comical situations. However, nothing that will have anyone with an IQ higher than a squid rolling on the floor laughing. If you have nearly completed your dark comedy section and are looking to add one more then by all means consider purchasing this. However, there are several other more impressive movies available."
5,These two women ROCK!,"First off, ""Bill Challenger"" has got to be one of the best instrumentals since ""Pipeline"". Just listen to it and it'll blow you away! The whole album kicks! Some of the songs are a bit more mellower but that's more of a balance than anything else. This band was the original Seatle band, way before Mudhoney and way way before Nirvana. I was fortunate enough to stumble upon the ""Gone to the Moon"" CD-4 CD single, and was treated to more awesome music. So, even their ""throw away"" songs are great. Get this CD. You won't be let down."
2,This shaver rattles the jaw bones,"My $100+ Norelco razor died after nearly 7 years so I decided to give this mid-range panasonic razor a try since it uses different blades. The thing vibrates like crazy and it gave me razor burn. The separate adapter only works on 120V which means you can't use it in Europe or Asia - Norelco's voltage converter was integrated and could be used seamlessly with 120V and 220V and the cord was coiled for easy storage. Its also made in China, which usually means ""low-end"" today. In short this razor falls short of my expectations and I hope to be able to return it and get my $50+ money back."
5,Excellent shaver for me.,"I have had this, my 3rd Panasonic shaver, for several days. (It only cost $10 more than my last one that is over 5 years old.) So far it has given me excellent smooth shaves with no irritation, and has not had to be recharged yet! I don't know where the other two reviewers are coming from, but I like it. I especially like being able to use it cordless or with the cord. That way, if it runs completely down, then I can just plug it in and don't have to wait for it to charge. I can't guarantee that other buyers will like it, but I give it 5 stars."
1,"Bad, bad deal !!",Just five months and it is gone. Simply stopped running. Water seems to have reached the internal parts.
2,Panasonic ES7024 shaver,"Does an effective use but I regret the purchase because:- the charger weighs more than the normal rechargeable shaver and thus difficult to carry on trips, and- it does not have a universal charger/adaper that can work on 110-220 volts as rechargeable shavers normally do. So it is useless if you travel to Europe as I do.From now on, I will stick to Braun, Philips etc."
5,PROMPT!,I got exactly what I ordered and it came so fast I couldn't believe it. I was extremely impressed.
3,"Confusing, many times over.","I'm still not sure what to think of this movie. I have seen it quite a few times and yet it still doesn't make sense to me.When mental patient James Cole (Bruce Willis) is sent back in time to find information on a lethal virus has wiped out five billion people in 1996. Mistakenly, he arrives in 1990. After explaining his plea to Dr. Kathryn Railly, (Madeleine Stowe) he is placed in a mental institution. In 1996, he kidnaps Railly, using her to find the 12 Monkeys, a group of revolutionists that are planning to release the virus into select cities. But he is wanted by the authorities for murder and kidnapping, plus he refuses to return to the future."
4,Really good,This movie is really good. Pitt plays one of his best roles and Bruce Willis is actually good! The scenario of this movie is excellent some will find it complicated but most will find it easy to follow. The reason I did NOT give this movie 5 stars is because Madeline Stow get in love with Willis way too quickly. It is a really good movie though after 2-3 times you've watched it it becomes boring.
3,Disappointed,After reading rave reviews I was excited to see this film. I found it confusing. It was like a jigsaw puzzle and it was up to me to figure it all out. I guess I need the dumb downed version. :)
4,12 Monkeys review,It was a very good movie - I have seen it before and it was nice to just be able to watch it again!
5,Monkey around with time,"Action, lots of action, violence and a taste for spiders. This is more intricate than the mindless ""Die Hard"" series. You have a solid plot and a rather good mystery. There is a great cast of supporting actors. Add that to a little time travel and a deadly virus and you have a decent movie.Bruce Willis is tasked to travel back from 2035 to today (1996) to brig back a pure strain of a deadly virus that was released into the world and wiping out most of mankind.The are the ""what if's"" of time and if you look close you may see your self. He gets more than he bargained for and so do we (a movie that will hold your attention.)"
4,A frigthening insight into a possible future,"an incredible movie, The story and plot are very interesting and change through out the movie. Action filled but still requires thinking"
5,Better each viewing,This movie is a classic and absolutely worth multiple viewings. It gets better each time you watch it as you find another piece of the puzzle you missed the last viewing. I recommend this movie to everyone I know (however I wouldn't recommend it for small children; probably a little scary for them and requires a decent amount of thought - they might just get too confused) and they always come back thanking me for the recommendation. So let me recommend this movie to you.
4,What a rip-off! There were NO monkeys in this film!!!,"Actually, I thought of this one as kind of a weird ""Back to the Future"" clone. Still, nobody does weirdness as well as Terry Gilliam, who is one of the most innovative directors out there! An interesting movie, despite the strangeness."
5,Must see,This is the best movie i have seen in my entire life i give it 5/5 stars every body MUST see it! It was not a box office hit because the majority of the people who saw it are to dumb to understand this master piece of a movie!
3,12 Monkeys Blu-ray,"It is a Blu-ray, a German Blu-ray. To watch the movie in English, you need to know a bit of German to go into the menu which is in German and switch to English and turn off the German subtitles. Otherwise, it is good disc."
5,"We Did It: 5,000,000,000 people will die.","The film 12 monkeys is something that must be seen by all right citizens. Resistors are expected to steal a VHS version of this film from the local Half Priced Books and watch it every quarter.The film is about a deadly virus that is released in 1996 and kills 5 billion people. The survivors must live underground, leaving only the animals on the surface of the earth. James Cole, a prisoner in 2035, is chosen to collect information about the virus. A group of scientists then send Cole to 1990 in an effort to find the Army of the 12 Monkeys and information about the virus. Will he find the virus and stop it?Michaelmatician commands us to obtain this film and learn specific dialog from Brad Pitt's character. This will enable all Resistors to deceive Doom Riders.We will learn to see the Michrotron. We will learn to see the Michrotron.2.342jeremyshingles .wordpress .com"
5,The way I see it...,"Any movie Bruce Willis is in, and he doesn't save the world, deserves 5 stars in my book."
4,"Another time travel but well done, interesting.","Another time travel movie but decently crafted plot (some mystery to it so not totally predictable) and even better scenery. Several good actors with Brad Pitt playing a great role and even Bruce Willis is good in this one. If a lover of SYFY, recommended but not a must see. Audience? SYFY lovers. Not a date movie."
4,Interesting,"A bruce willis role that goes a beyond what you normally see bruce willis do. Madeleine Stowe is amazing and Brad pitt is beyond cool. great directing job by Terry Gilliam and defintely worth owning. Whenever you want to see something interesting and a little less run of the mill,...this is definitely for you"
5,"GILLIAM, GILLIAM, GILLIAM........","What a movie! I like the fact that a lot of people i've talked don't like this movie. It makes it more of MY favorite movie. Well, i don't know if it is my favorite but it's close! Terry Gilliam is the one of the most creative minds in film. This also has the best performance by Brad Pitt that you'll see!"
4,Good Sci-fi,"I was finally able to see this via streaming, and it was surprisingly good. Brad Pitt's performance was outstanding. There was plenty of twists and turns, that kept me guessing until the very end. The film has held up well to the test of time, and is worth a couple of viewings to pick up on all the subtle plot twists."
2,Brad Pitts Character Too Over the Top,"I felt the movie had potential (especially after reading the reviews) until the director introduces Brad Pitts’ character. This overly manic character went on for too long for my taste. It was exhausting and distracting. From this point through another 30 minutes, 12 Monkeys no longer held my interest and pressed the eject button."
3,Not a block buster,It doesn't really make sense but science fiction is science fiction. Acting was okay but the subject was crumbly. Won't bother with it a second time
5,"""Do you think you're living in the future, James?""","Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt) is a paranoid schizophrenic, he's crazy. Catherine Railly (Madeline Stowe) is a psychiatrist, she's not crazy. James Cole (Bruce Willis) is a 'volunteer' who is sent to the 1990s from the year 2035 to find out why 99% of the human race was wiped out, he's not crazy either - of course no one in the 1990s knows that. Terry Gilliam is the director of this film. It's not really a science fiction, it's a fantasy of the kind only Gilliam can produce. David Peoples (Co-writer of Blade Runner) and his wife Janet Peoples wrote the script. If you ignore the excellent performances and the outstanding direction you'll find that the plot is as brilliant as it is complex. Watch this film!"
5,12 Monkeys Brilliant on BluRay!!!,"One of the great modern cinematic classics, 12 Monkeys looks beautiful and gracious on BluRay, It is very nice to see a film such as this get the treatment it deserves. Cheers!"
4,12 Monkeys (1995),"Terry Gilliam resists many of his comedic tendencies in this mostly serious, increasingly intense thriller, which, despite adopting a morose storyline, manages some mordant moments of humor. In 2035, a man named James Cole (Bruce Willis), a prisoner of an underground penitentiary, is sent back in time to investigate the cause of a viral pandemic that caused five billion deaths in 1997. After explaining his task to those of the ""past"" world ('97), Cole is put in an insane asylum, where he meets the eccentric and extremely unstable Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), who he believes may have the answer to the catastrophic riddle. Madeleine Stowe co-stars as James' psychiatrist and eventual collaborator in his search for any clues, and Christopher Plummer plays Goines' virologist father. Brilliant for its mounting of suspense, 12 Monkeys commands engagement, then rips any understanding one may have mustered from under them through hefty, shocking twists, making it an unforgettable watch."
4,Gripping Sci-Fi Intrique!,"Science Fiction with time travel and deadly world of germs actually keeps your attention. This is a film that features Bruce Willis (as time traveler from the year 2035) and Brad Pitt (an insane son of a rich influential scientist).The movie works on all fronts despite a bizarre plot. Terry Cole (Bruce Willis) is a prisoner in the year 2035, where all earthlings must live underground to escape a deadly plague on the earth's surface. Terry is asked to travel back in time to the month before the germs were released and try to change the future. He ends up in a insane asylum in 1990 the first trip. His psychiatrist, Katherine Railly and a friendly inmate Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt) are his main contacts and he feels that they may help him find the clues to the epidemic that killed 5 billion people in 1997.Original intrigue keeps the audience interested and involved with the surprise ending. Food for thought in our time of worry about pandemics."
4,A Splendid Horror Film,"This is one of the most intense visual experiences of the '90's, with Gilliam fusing medieval and futuristic imagery to form a frightening vision of all time merged into one terrifying present. This is one of Willis' best performances, one that should be well noted before some critic dismisses him yet again as just another action-movie hero. Willis practically bleeds humanity as the unwilling prophet of doom. He captures that rarest quality, one that most actors can't do--humility. David Morse is quietly chilling as the angel of death. If the film has one flaw, it's the lack of comedy that infuses most Gilliam films. As I get older, I need a little humor to accompany my apocalyptic despair. This one *will* give you nightmares."
5,Amazing,Yikes. A very thoughtful science fiction movie/horror movie/comedy/drama/action from acclaimed director Terry Gilliam. Bruce Willis turns in his best performance as does Brad Pitt. I haven't tried it...but I think this must be what watching movies while high is like.
5,hampster factors,After buying the criterion collection of Brazil i waited no longer to buy 12 monkeys DVD collectors edition.The making of documentary which runs almost 90 minutes is one the best making of a movie accounts I've ever seen. The only 2 that i have seen that have surpassed this was hearts of darkness (the making of apocolypse now) and under pressure (the making of the abyss).The audio commentary only adds to the genius and madness of terry gilliam.A true gilliam masterpiece made even better.A must own DVD for any collector.
1,worst movie,"This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time... It is terribly boring... I kept trying to stay awake through the whole movie.. About on half hour before it was over, I just couldn't handle it anymore... What a waste of time and life... BORING, BORING, BORING...."
2,Less than it seems,"Can't touch the actor performances, but the story is more a competing morass of themes that leave the ending dead. There is no real convergence of meaning because the themes never come together. The psychiatric world is characterized accurately, especially in Dr. Railly's self-affirming statement to her supervisor.Cole never figures out what his flashbacks are all about, and at the last minute takes an about face to change the future he knows can't be done. What the time travel, psy-world, and animals rights activists have in common is unknown from start to end. Each of these themes aren't explored and converged to produce anything stimulating.Rent it if you're bored. A much better story and drama is The Fifth Element."
4,Confusing,"What is it with Bruce Willis, he seems to like movies with numbers in: 5th element, 12 monkeys, 6th sense. Anyway, there were no moneys in this movie, so don't be mislead."
1,stunned with how bad this was,I am amazed at anyone who thought this was a good movie. It was shallow and boring. There was nothing of any intellectual or thought provoking nature. I am always amazed at how people can be so enamored with pure drivel and then be totally bored when an in depth movie comes along. I would give it zero stars if I could.
1,Warning!! Not a happy ending!,"If you are the type that likes happy endings, avoid this movie! Bruce Willis dies and he doesn't save the world, and the journey to this depressing conclusion is no fun at all. It reminded me of Arlington Road, where the terrorist uses the good guy to blow up the building at the end of the movie. Also, in this movie, the repetitive flashbacks to Bruce's airport dream were overdone. By the 3rd time, I was saying ""I got it already"", and by the 5th or 6th flashback I was ready to throw something at the screen. In the featurette, Terry Gilliam said that he thought he had managed to snooker the major studios into producing a ""European art movie"". He did, and I hate European art movies. On the other hand, if you like such things, you'll probably like the film. It was well acted."
3,Great cast... not so great movie...,"This simple movie had of course, a great cast. But I thought that the plot was pretty complicated at first but it became simple in the end. There was a lot of chaotic things going on and the movie lost my focus. I tried to stick with this movie but I just lost interest while I was watching it, and I was just sitting through this movie. I sighed with relief once it was over and I don't think I will be watching it again. This movie was a waste of money to me but I do recommend renting it off the shelves first before you buy."
5,"To watch not once, not twice....maybe more than a few times","Really great....this is one of those several-times-watched movies of mine (and there's not many of those). This is the type of movie you watch, and then invite your friends over to watch, simply to see and hear their reaction, and then discuss it with them. A whole new respect for Brad Pitt's acting and adaptability to roles emerged after this movie, as well as thorough appreciation for both Willis and Stowe and the way they carry they carry thier roles out, and infuse the film with their presence. See this."
1,Don't even bother,"This movie bites.There were not 12 kung fu masters like the title implied. After watching Iron Monkey, Mad Monkey Kung Fu, and Iron Monkey 2, I had high expectations for 12Monkeys. Total disappointment. Don't even bother watching it."
1,avoid this movie,"I was searching through Amazon for some different kind of movies to watch - saw this had almost 5 stars - WHY ?! The acting is fine and Brad Pitt plays a great insane person, but the movie itself is HORRENDOUS. And I wasted 2 hour of my life (2:05 to be exact) to watch Bruce Willis time jump a bunch of times to build up a somewhat complicated plot spoiler alert!!!) just to see him FAIL TO STOP THE VIRUS IN THE END ?! So what was the point of making the movie ? This was worse than just having the bad guy win, the entire plot for the first 2 hours of the movie was to build up on how they were going to stop it, just to see in the end - they don't ?! AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COST."
3,a mixed bag,"There is much to like in this movie; and much to dislike, unfortunately. Great visuals - everything is run down (the past) or bizarely technical (the future). Many viewers apparently like Brad Pitts portrayal of an insane person, but I found it tedious. Speaking of tedious, there's a seemingly endless scene in a mental hospital. I think the story would have been better paced had that been reduced. The story is interesting, but can be hard to follow in detail, which makes the DVD a good choice. I enjoyed the movie a lot more via the scene selections - but tedious when viewed from start to finish."
3,Is the past history?,"This is an outstanding film, a perfect mix of comedy (provided by Bradd Pitt) Romance, Drama, Trgedy, and action. This is definatley a must have, Its very confusing at first. However, by the end it all fits together"
3,JUST A MATTER OF TIME,"12 MONKEYS is certainly one of the most innovative scifi films of the nineties, with a complex performance from Bruce Willis and a showy Oscar nominated turn from Brad Pitt. Terry Gilliam directs with a fierce impending sense of doom, and the supporting cast features a particularly effective Madeleine Stowe. Time travel movies are often hard to construct, and Gilliam tries novel approaches to the theme. I found myself getting confused at various times, not sure of what Willis' role was in stopping the virus, and just who the people were that were manipulating him. Willis gives a fierce performance and Stowe is very good as the psychiatrist who finds herself Willis' soulmate. The movie's cryptic ending left me wondering what had happened and what would happen in the future. Technically a good film, but somehow it left me wanting more."
2,Just a mishmash of hype,"12 Monkeys is a very tedious film. Even once you realize whats really going on, you don't care. It's like one of the movies you might see at a hotel (actually where I saw it), cheap and made for cable. The only thing good about the film is Bruce Willis."
5,Twelve Monkeys rates a 12 on a scale of 1 to 10,"If you want a great objective review, visit the Amazon.com site and get their editorial review.If you want a quick, strictly subjective opinion about this movie, here it is:Twelve Monkeys is an entrancing movie that keeps you guessing throughout. It's way out there on the very edge of believability. It WILL make you think about time and reality in ways you probably have never thought before. It's definitely one of the ten best movies of all time. Bruce Willis, Madelline Stowe, and Brad Pitt are at their very best, and probably all deserved Oscars for their performances (Pitt was nominated).Buy it or rent it! Watch it! Love it!"
5,A stunner,"I saw this twice in the theatre, both times in theatres with lousy projection and terrible sound. Finally it came out on video, and I could see it for the splendid work that it is. A dark and twisty ride through several shifting time planes, it rewards repeated viewings like few movies of the 90s. Bruce Willis gives the best performance of his career,but even a wizard like Terry Gilliam can't get blood out of the stone named Brad Pitt. A great movie. Haunting, funny, thrilling, ultimately moving."
5,conspiracy theory,"This is a fascinating sci-fi movie with lots of twists and turns. The movie is very complex and almost haunting in it's surrealism. Bruce Willis gave one of his best dramatic performances ever as James Cole, a man sent back in time to save the world. I enjoyed the character of Kathryn Railly (played by b-movie queen, Madeleine Stowe) very much, as well, because she added both a sense of realism and continuity. Brad Pitt as the resident kook, Jeffrey Goines, was just all over the place. The guy was a little nutty but it was pretty hot when he pulled his pants down. ""12 Monkeys"" is the type of movie that will invoke thought and discussion. I don't want to give it away but this is also not the type of movie that is all tied up once you finish it. The 2005 DVD includes the original trailer as well as a featurette."
5,Good Documentary in the DVD,"What makes this film so great is in the details. The cartoons that comes on in the background. The ingenious meshing of Hitchcock dialog in the theater scene. Just to mention a very few. And the intelligent premise that someone actually coming to us from the future would very likely be treated as insane and institutionalized in our present, rather than hailed as a hero.I always considered Brad Pitt as a just a ""face,"" but this movie proves otherwise. His performance eclipses that of Bruce Willis, even though this is considered the start of Willis' more serious acting endeavors.Worth mentioning: Included in the DVD, there's a significant documentary entitled ""The Hamster Factor and Other Tales of Twelve Monkeys."" It's more than the usual ""Making Of. . ."" press-kit documentaries that are thrown in with other movie DVD's, and worth watching/sitting-through. It shows the agonizing process of film making in general, even for someone like Gilliam."
4,.,"Interesting, intricately constructed, and generally enjoyable Terry Gilliam film suffers only from the occasional gimmicky tonality and general unevenness that seem to plague most Gilliam films. Still, this is a strikingly unique movie that has a lot going for it, including oodles of detail and nuance, evocative, surreal visuals, and lots of imagination. The performances aren't as universally excellent as they've been said to be, but they're certainly interesting, and the last five minutes of this film provide a riveting and challenging climax. Recommended."
4,"Great movie, lackluster HD DVD.","I've always loved the movie, and while it looks great in HD, it's very reminiscent of the first few DVDs that came out. It has quite a few defects just during normal playback, and the additional content is exactly the same as it is on the DVD... which looked bad on the original, and looks TERRIBLE now.Unfortunately, there aren't many HD DVDs to choose from yet, but having your expectations set at a reasonable level can't hurt. :/ I suspect this one will be like the first Tron DVD release, and coming out a ways down the road (assuming the format survives) to compare against newer releases."
4,This was an interesting tell all book.,I thought this book was as good as any other Deathlands book. I enjoyed reading about Ryan and J.B. in the early years. I was really surprised about Doc being in the book. But it answered the question about why Doc always carries those two balls with him. It also explains how Trader received his rad poisoning. For anyone that read Pilgramage From Hell they would now know what happened with Trader. I have read every book by James Axler and there has not been one book I've been disappointed with. The only disappointment with this book was it being to short of a story. I hope to read more books on the Trader in the future.
3,Almost but not quite...,"I'm a long time reader of the Deathlands series and, as stated by others, this book falls a little short. I'd love to see a series of Ryan and Trader and the back story of how they met and what Ryan did to earn has mentor's respect. Not a best effort but a good foundation for something bigger and better."
2,A let down,"After waiting for well over a year to read this novel, and being hyped about it, I found that it was a serious let down. The story was sub-standard and poorly written. The villians were stereotypical card board cut outs. The situation was just another standard back stabbing fight for survival. But the worst thing is that there were two major mistakes in the first 60 pages. I won't tell you what they are but suffice to say I almost put the book down and couldn't continue. However, the last part of the book, the section dealing with the birth of the series was just incredible. That section gets a five out of five from me. And after 12 years we finally get a chance to see what Trader looks like."
2,A missed opportunity,"What could have been a great chance to tell the story of Trader and the war-wag days has been squandered, resulting in a decidedly sub-par Deathlands novel. Serious inaccuracies, some poor writing and a pretty lame plot threaten to make this book almost not worth buying. The bit that really does make it worth buying has nothing to do with the story at all. Right at the end of the book there are essays on the birth and evolution of the Deathlands saga. They really should have made the entire book like this, it's totally fascinating stuff.Treat the story as nothing more than a folk tale and not part of the Deathlands canon and you might be able to put up with its failings. All I hope is that if someone tries something similar in the future, and I hope they do, that they put a bit more effort and thought into it."
3,This is a pretty good story for Deathlands fans.,"This is the first in what I hope is a series about Trader and Ryan before Ryan met Krysty et all. The writing is a little below par, but the story is interesting enough. It ain't Shakespeare but it ain't bad."
2,Much ado about nothing.,"We the loyal fans of the Deathlands saga, were let down. The story was only about 200 pages, the story was rushed. Axler or whomever should read their books.The way we know the trader, was not the way he was depicted in this story. Where was his infamous quotes, none were present in this story. Plus he gets poisoned, just like a ""rube."" The story should have been 348 pages then do the history of Deathlands and Outlanders.I enjoyed the extras, but the story was bad. they fit everything into 348 pages. So we the loyal and diehard fans of this series were sold a bill of goods.James Axler and Gold Eagle books owe us an apology for this abbreviated story, this poor excuse of a ""special, collector's edition book""How can you do this to us?"
3,I hope never to encounter another ENCOUNTER!,"Yeah, the story was too short, and, yeah, the characters were too two-dimensional (sad that our Casper the ghost author didn't develop the characters more -- which is what I thought the whole point of this book was about). And, yeah, there are two major mistakes in the first sixty pages. But my chief complaint was this: who cares about this psychotic character, Trader? What makes the Publisher think the average fan out there is eager to follow the antics of a character who frequently crosses the border into that of a murderous psycho? Not me, Baby! Hoo-Ha! The treatment renders the story into a disagreeable yarn, wherein nobody wants to follow the main character, known as Trader, around much at all, if not totally avoid the sucker completely. (Then again, some subsurface rock dwellers are fascinated with reading about Hitler.) As Confucius might once have penned the reader's experience, ""Living with Trader like athlete's foot -- soon becomes irritating."""
4,For my husband,I purchased this book for my husband. He really needed it and he has blessed his friends with it. This would be great for a men's group.
4,Author of Mama and Us & Suicide-The Explosion Within,"I enjoyed this book so much I had to buy another copy for my son! This is a great book for anyone, but especially a young adult male."
1,Broken Silence,"Entertaining for awhile, but when Tex mentions cruising with his girlfriend in 1963 and her singing along with the Beatles ""She Loves You"" on the radio, this kind of blows it since the Beatles did not hit major airwaves until 1964."
4,I Won't Order More of These,"These arrived promptly but I was a little disappointed. I wanted crew socks; couldn't find any and settled for these. They're VERY long, and tight at the top."
3,"Weight lighter than expected for ""Medium Weight Socks""","These socks were thinner feeling than I expected for ""medium weight"" socks. Havent had games yet to use them, so we will see how well they hold up."
5,great socks,"Great quality, long lasting sock. My husband loves the bright colors and gets lots of compliments in the office"
3,Strange,"Upon listening to PM Dawn's follow up to The Bliss Album, ""Jesus Wept,"" I was amazed. No longer just thinking man's rappers, this group brought innovation that has yet to be equalled in the world of r&b/hip-hop/rap. Their music really defies description, with grinding guitar-driven songs, Al B. Sure take-offs, and catchy, rhythmic melodies that can be considered true pop. I was hoping for more of the same with ""Dearest Christian,"" but instead got a bunch of songs that seemed like Jesus Wept rejects. There are two notable exceptions: Yang as Private I's is outstanding. Getting back to more of their roots. Psychadelic rap with strong r&b influences, making for an utterly unique sound. The untitled final track, much like the final track on Jesus Wept (Fantasia's Confidential Ghetto) is incredible. Beatle-esque to be sure, it is an epic of a recording. Unfortunately, besides those two, the other tracks are utterly forgettable. Still unsure whether those two good songs were worth the [$] ..."
4,you'll be sorry for not hearing this album sooner,PM Dawn explodes the slew of vocal bands out there for what they are- a bunch of boys. PM Dawn follows in the stem of Steveland and this album does not disappoint. Do not be turned off by the religious character of the album title. The first four tracks will have you on your knees thanking the almighty for the beauty of it all and this album.
4,Adventure,Like it well enough to seek other books in the series! Found this while looking for another group of books. Who knew?
5,SIIMPLY MARVELOUS,This book was awesome. It taught me alot as to what it is to really and truly be dedicated to the Lord.
2,Readable but not enjoyable,"As an avid reader, this book was readable- a one day read. It had potential but I feel like I was rushed into knowing the characters (NO character development). Maybe she should have just started the story with Zakia as an adult rather than rushing us through her life...The second half is way better than the first."
3,Pretty Good,"Pretty good so far. Not done yet. It does seem too ""sweet""...like everything works out so perfect. I did not like this book."
1,Utterly disappointing,"I have picked up this book four times in an attempt to ""give it another chance."" I still haven't finished it! I wanted to like it so much. I love Christian fiction, I read it regularly. This however, was amateur at best. There was little to no character development. The story line is rushed an underdeveloped. It was like on one side of the page she was in high school, on the next; in college, on the next; graduating, on the next; getting married. I'm exaggerating a little, but there was little effort to develop the story lines in between, that it really feels that way. If the main character was experiencing something difficult, we barefly ""felt it."" There were just surface words that alluded to a tough time. This story lacked the agony, the emotion, the writing talent, the energy and excitement of a good book. And...I haven't even started in on the gospel yet. Don't buy it!"
2,Amateur writing,"This was one of those I just wanted to finish. Good thing because the author had a great story going then, all of a sudden, everything wrapped up nice and tidy in a paragraph. I never felt like I got to know the characters.I was disappointed as I enjoy Christ-based authors and their characters. This was not an interesting book."
5,You Have to Read This Book!!!!!!!!!,This is an Awesome book.I was searching for a book for our book club and then this book showed up.I had read it before many years ago it is a quick read everyone finished this book quickly.The end is so surprising it makes you read it again because you say wait a minute what just happened here.Don't read ahead.This book is worth reading it is so hard to find really good Christian Fiction but Thanks to Amazon.com I have found many good books.
2,Not the SeatShield I was looking for,"I bought this seat cover because I thought it was the Waterproof SeatShield that is advertised in Runners World, but it turns out that product is only sold in stores and at the manufacturer website. I returned this product because it's is a coated nylon that doesn't feel good if I'm sweaty and in my shorts after running or tennis and bought the other one which is waterproof and feels a lot better."
4,sport seat shield,"Grants sport seat shield ,Efficient, affordable ,keeps upholstry from daily wear & tear& accidents.They are also washable ! Works for me!"
5,"Seal Child, a truly enchanting book","i love this book soo very much. it has an un-ending glimmer of magic that captivates you and makes you want to keep reading. it has a quality many books don't have, re-read-ability. i have read this book un-countable times and i love it more and more, it doesn't get dull, it keeps on shining, i recommend this book to anyone who can read, your SURE to love it. {i apologize for the miss spelled words :) }"
5,"beautiful story, beautifully written","This is one of those rare childrens books that doesn't fade when you go back to it. I read this book for the first time when I was 10 years old, I'm in my twenties now and it still holds up. Each of Peck's characters has amazing depth -especially for a childrens book- and they become your friend upon reading. All the scenes are described so clearly I have memories from this book as if I lived it myself. Reading the book again is like returning home after a trip.The book also gives a good message. It gently teaches about humans being responsible for nature and the world around us, as well as teaching important lessons about friendship that we can all use hearing again.I would recommend this book highly. It's out of print but there are plenty of used copies around to be bought."
1,Dont Bother,"Too, too small. I wear a 6.5 and these are very small and tight, i sent them back.dont bother they are not corretly labeled"
4,Decent practice shoes,"These things won't last forever, but they're a good deal considering the price. They also fitted fine, I normally wear a 7, and I didn't have any problems with sizing. The only real downfall is that they are lined in white. I have dirty feet and after two hours of dancing the shoes are already showing their age."
4,Capezio Cobra Ballet Shoe,"I danced for years as a kid, and these split sole capezios were one of my favorite types. They don't shape to your feet as well as leather shoes, but they hold up a little longer (and because my toes are on a slant/angle, the shape looks better anyway). I ordered a 10.5 as other buyers complained they ran small, but they ended up being true to size - I am a street shoe size 10 and needed size 10 for these shoes. I had to exchange them, and the exchange process was hassle free and quick - had the new shoes within a few days."
4,Runs a bit small,Came on time. They are still good but just a bit small (some people prefer it more snug) I've only been using them for a short while but so far I'm pretty happy with them.
3,ok,"This isn't the best ballet shoe I've ever had, but it's not the worst either. It's just pretty average. I wear a size 7.5 street shoe so I ordered a 7.5 for this shoe. The length is just a little short, but my ballet shoes always stretch after a while, so I think this will be fine. However, they're way too wide for my feet even with the strings tied as tight as I can get them. Also, the elastics are already sewn on even though the picture doesn't show them that way. I wish they weren't, because they're not exactly in the right place for me. The shoes are made in Thailand for those interested in country of origin. They're an ok shoe, but I won't get them again when these wear out because the sizing is too awkward and the elastics are pre-sewn."

1,Norton Uninstall Deluxe,"Norton no longer supports this product and with good reason. It was great in windows 98. Got rid of anything you want to get rid of in your puter. It does not work in xp AND you cannot get rid of it. (yes I have gone to Control panel, add/remove etc. And I have tried the uninstall in the product itself.) Just being there taking up space is bad enough but periodically it interfers with other programs. At this point in time I would say DONT USE IT."
2,Was Disappointed,"When I received this watch (Festina 160793), I immediately noticed that it had a few very small (but noticeable) scratches on the crystal and silver rim. At first, I thought is was a second that was sent to me by mistake. Also, the dual time dial was not working. The customer service agent explained that the dual time dial battery was out of power. He advised me to take the watch to any watch repair store to replace the battery! For a brand new, never been used, expensive watch!! Also, it took me a bit of time to set the flip-over metal clasp mechanism on the leather band. In addition, due to the heavy weight of this watch, the turning knob was very uncomfortable against the top of my wrist. Finally, the watch comes with no booklet to explain how to set the time, set the dual time dial, and use the clasp mechanism. The design, packaging, and quality control of this watch needs work!!"
1,The BEST movie of all time!!,"Just kidding. Now that I've got your attention, forget about this movie. I could have given better direction myself, and as for the charcters...what characters? If there is any TCM fan out there who has not seen this film, don't worry about it. It totally cahges your view on Leatherface and leaves you with a nautious feeling at the film's climax. If the goal of the screenwriters and director was to bore the audience- then they achieved greatly as no one has done before in regards to a sequal...."
1,"ANOTHER TERRIBLE, BUT LAUGHABLE MASSACRE MOVIE!","LIKE THE ORIGINAL ""HORROR MOVIE"", THIS SEQUEL WILL HAVE YOU LAUGHING YOURSELF TO TEARS BECAUSE OF HOW STUPID IT IS. ONCE AGAIN, DO NOT LOOK FOR A SERIOUS HORROR MOVIE, INSTEAD GET READY TO SIT DOWN, RELAX, AND WATCH A REALLY FUNNY MOVIE!"
2,Disgrace to Leatherface Fans!!!!!!!!,I can't believe how stupid this movie is. I did find it to be hilarious though.
3,Hard to recomment...,"The 4th movie in the serie. Loved by some, hated by many. Is it really bad? Booth yes and no. If you'd changed the title, and throwen anything out that is recemblend to the serie; then NO. Otherwise; YES. The writer/director of this movies probably tought they was able to create a good Texas movie by throwing in Leatherface and a couple of chainsaw scenes, but unfortantly for them: Thats not enough. The movie isent good, but it isent bad either. Personally i think it was a so-so movie. It is hard to recomment this movie."
1,We've Seen This Before.,"I wasn't originally going to write a review for this film, but I might as well be heard.Summary: Lost teenagers get slaughtered my maniacal family of cannibals.If you've seen the original (and the only good) Texas Chainsaw Massacre film, you need not see this one. It's a virtual remake of the first one (not that parts 2 and 3 weren't), and brings no amount of originality to the series. Even appearances by Matthew McConaughey and Renee Zellweger can't save this turkey from getting tossed to garbage pile. An over amount of campy humor doesn't help any either.If you haven't seen any of the TCM films, and you want to, just stick with the first one. None of the sequels even come close to comparing with the original."
1,Waste of time,At first glance this looks like a modern day remake of the horror classic. But those who last to the end will find out that its nothing more than a cheap rip off. Despite the title there is no chainsaw massacring which with no doubt will leave fans disappointed. Do not be fooled be a few stars who appear in this movie because the acting cannot save this instantly forgettable flick that will leave TCM fans screaming for the blood of the cast and crew.
1,Leatherface's demise!,"Why oh why did they bother? This is perhaps one of the worst horror films(if you can call it horror) ever to disgrace my video collection. The first was brilliant, the second was good, the third was ok but this 4th installment is garbage. I am a big fan of horror but I failed to enjoy this film, a dull bland story, stupid acting and what happened to Leatherface? He was unthreatening and stupid. I hope there is a 5th film that tries to salvage what this rubbish destroyed of THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE."
1,Leatherface is a tranny?,"This movie sucks so bad that it is unbelievable. Mathew McConaughey is so over the top and so horrible that it makes you want to spew vomit out of your nose and every orafice. Renee' Zellwegger is just as cute as can be but she is in this turd and it is so bad that if it had Brando, Deniro, Ingrid Bergman and John Wayne in it it would still suck. Leatherface is... I guess a tranny. Letherface is a tranny? What the hell? This is just stupid. WHo cares. Don't watch it. Don't buy it. It is awful."
2,"Highly Over-the-Top black comedy, Could have been better","Outrageous black-humored remake of Tobe Hooper's 1974 horror movie features four teens in a car crash visiting a house where Leatherface and his insane family live,but all four die but it isn't Leatherface killing them it's Leatherface's crazy brother Vilmer killing only 2 teens while Leatherface kills one with a sledgehammer. The black-humor is the movie's redeeming value and this movie does feature some hilarious scenes like where Vilmer uses a remote control for his robotic leg,Leatherface yelling and screaming non-stop,and instead of eating people they have a pizza for dinner. A way,way over-the-top black comedy is watchable and a whole lot better than part 3 but only worth a rental but do not buy unless you seen it first."
1,Incomprehensibly horrible,"As a fan of the first three films (for different reasons), I have to say that I am literally angry for having wasted 45 minutes of my life (I watched it at 2X after the first 15 minutes) with this horrible, horrible film.There isn't a single worthwhile moment here. The acting is beyond awful, there is NOTHING funny about it (and this coming from somebody who thinks Part 2 is the greatest black comedy ever), there is nothing scary about it, and they DECIMATE characters like Leatherface (who is reduced to a moaning transvestite that is incapable of murdering anybody) and GRANDPA. HOW DARE YOU B*ASTARDS EVEN HAVE GRANDPA IN A SCENE AND THEN HAVE HIM DO NOTHING?!?!?!?!I'm so angry I don't know where to begin. See #1 if you want to see a scary movie; see #2 if you want a black comedy (and the low point of Denis Hopper's career); see #3 if you just want to laugh at the crazy character Alfredo. This one is an abject disaster."
3,good but not great,i am a huge tcm fan but this 1 didn't have any wow like the rest. i must say mathew did a great job but whats going on with leatherface is he a transvestite or something. he just isn't scary. mathew was the only good actor in this . ohhh 1 more thing whats with the girl who is she?
2,A Decent Plot but a Bad Movie,"First of all, I have not seen any of the other TCM movies, but with Renee Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey I figured I would watch it. Of course there were the typical horror movie moments...group of friends get stranded, many chase/fight scenes, the girl running (Renee Zellweger) trips and falls alot, she runs up the stairs instead of out the door, ect. Although I expected some of this, I think this movie tried so hard to be scary that it just wasn't. This movie also had bad acting, although Matthew McConaughey was very good. However, I am giving two stars because it was fun to see Renee and Matthew in this movie together, and I thought the story line was okay, but maybe if they had different actors or a different director it would have been better."
1,What happend to you Leatherface you used to be beautiful?,This movie is an insult to the TCM series.First off their is on good acting in this movie.Also their is no suspence what so ever.And the most important thing is they made Leatherface a cross dressing freak whos afraid of his own family.Dont be tricked by the cover the killer is not a women. Last note this is just a ... remake of the first one right down to the end.Just see the first and theird ones in the seires there the best.
1,Horrible movie!,Please listen everybody this movie is terrible-don't bother ok!It is just dumb not scary!
1,What was Matthew and Renée thinking?,This piece of trash was completely unwatchable. I can't believe Matthew and Renée read this script and said yeah lets do it. Absolutely dreadful!
3,Don't listen to all the crap!,"This 1995 'remake' to the classic mid 70's flick TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE is genuinely entertaining. The acting is fairly good and the movie is actually kind of funny at points (in a good way). The dark humor and ferocious horror/suspense is pretty thrilling. The movie is a re-make so it's basically the same thing as the first one except the teens (although they look 30) are coming home from prom when they get stuck out in the woods. Eventually they come toward the demented family and the 'fun' really starts. I really found it scary BECAUSE you don't know in the beginning whether that lady is one of them or she realy wants to help out... the last 20 minutes were fairly weak compared to the original but this was a pretty decent movie all in all. I thought it was creepy and had some funny moments. Not the strong point in the series, I think part 3 was better then this one, but it is worth a watch.GRADE: C+"
2,THIS WAS A FUNNI ONE,"ok lets cut to the chase this movie sucked...BAD!!The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars was because that guy wilmer or vilmer or w.e who was played by matthew mconaughey was madd funni!!And me and my friends enjoyed laughing at leatherface who was the biggest baby u could possibly imagine!!I just wantyed to punch the telivision screen because for two things...1.I couldnt bare to comprehend that a excellent slasher as TCM was ruined by this dumb movie and 2.BECAUSE LEATHERFACE WOULDNT STOP SCREAMING CAUSE HE IS A LOSER!!!!!!!And ur supposed to be afraid of this loser?I have seen the first,third and the remake all i thought were excellent movies and i am hoping to see TCM2 which i have heard good things about.Only see this movie for a good laugh!"
1,Worst TCM film PERIOD!,"By far this is the WORST TCM film to date! The only thing that kept this film afloat were Renne and Mathew, though Mathew did overplay the role a bit trying to act too psychotic. And what is with Mathew's hydrolic leg? I mean come on that is SO stupid.. using TV remotes to operate the damn thing Pathetic!In the end this movie is just a disgrace to the other 3 films.I hope the TCM Remake does better but very doubtful considering what the makers of the film have commented on how they want to portrait it ""It will focus less on the gore and more on the thriller aspect of the story"". Hello?! As Gunner Hanson put it ""Did you even watch the Original TCM?"".. well put Gunner. If this is what is to be expected, then expect to see another Scream movie :\"
4,great horror comedy,The major reason that the rep of this Chainsaw has been massacred is it's high comedic content. There's far more weird humor in this one than anyone could have expected. It's shockingly funny and contains gags (pardon the pun) that only Chainsaw fans would appreciate. The pizza gag is a funny follow-up to a line from part 3. The spoken word intro is a great commentary on parts 2 and 3. Leatherface even resumes his cross-dressing from the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. There are some great cameos too. All of this means that this wouldn't be the best Chainsaw for newbies to start with. Those expecting straight serious horror also may not appreciate it at first. Next Generation is a playful parody of the Chainsaw movies that's obviously not intended to be taken too seriously.
2,I'm sorry but huh?,A family of backwoods hillbilly a-holes terrorize a group of prom kids and one of them chases the kids around with a chainsaw. The ending makes no sense. This rich guy comes out of nowhere and starts berating the hillbillys and then leaves. Who the heck was he? The editor and the director must be potheads.
1,Leatherface as a transvestite,Only one star because zero stars is unavailable. ... This movie is so bad its damaging to the series part 1 and 3 were good I didnt like part 2 but this movie is worse than Valentine and Urban Legend combined. ...
1,A pale shadow of its predecessors,"Very boring and lame. None of the humor, wacky characters, great acting and special effects of Saw 2."
2,What in the world?,"Okay... It seemed all right. Good even, until the last fifteen minutes. It was kind of neat, having so many scenes re-made from the original, though that made it very predictable. But then it totally lost me. And I still don't know, who was that in the hospital? I wonder if anyone knows!"
1,Plan 9 from Outerspace it maybe time to hand over your crown,"Parts 2 & 3 are Citizen Kane-caliber classics compared to this dross. Uses same plot of demented chainsaw family terrorizing a hapless group (this time teens on prom night). More like a remake than a sequel, unpleasent instead of scary, and a surprising lack of chainsaw action (once or twice i think, i dare not watch again to find out). But all of that is nothing compared to the ludicrous government conspiracy (which is the closet thing to a merit that this film has). Forget fearing the original this is the movie to be afraid of; avoid at ALL costs. What do you expect for a flick that collected dust on the selves for 4 yrs. before seeing video release? This version (original called The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre), unfortunately, restores about 10 min. of cut footage. A travesty to the original, that surprising was written & directed by Kim Henkel co-writer & producer of the 1st film!! WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Different... very primal,"Weird, but this movie reminded me of what animals we were not so long ago. I'm sure that's how we acted.... how the hell did we become so civilized??I actually thought the sexually between Matthew and his women was kinda hot.. raw... rough. Something brutally honest about it.. if I may turn a cheek to PC for just a moment.Sorry I'm in a abnormal state of mind after watching this so i hope I haven't offended you.. C i am already heading back home to my compassionate concerned self. booo!"
1,Life is just too short for this,"Imagine a horror movie made by 13 year old boys with a limited budget who've been eating chocolate and drinking coca cola all morning. No actually, that would probably be much better. This was utter, utter nonsensical trash. Some may try to pass off the fact that it was so bad as some kind of post modern parody, but lets be honest here.. it's just bad... and not so bad it's good. It's so bad it's really bad. It never ceases to amaze me that given large amounts of money and input Hollywood can come up with so much trash. Seriously folks... 3 score years and ten..life isn't long enough.. don't waste 2 hours of it on this."
3,Surprisingly not bad,"This installment happens to be the most realistic, scary and imaginary of the pack. This movie's so called disturbing points were funny more then scary. Renee Zelwegger and Mathew McCaugnahey star in this flick which makes it all the more watchable. Very entertaining and scary with some very good acting. I saw this movie for the first time on HBO, seeing this was only in select theatres (practically straight to video) it was pretty good. The DVD has a great cover art as well. The DVD is pretty week, only cast bios and scene selection, presented in fullscreen. But the movie is a low budget straight to cable sequel so i guess it is the best they could do. Not bad at all for a TCM sequel.Rated R/1997/95 MIN."
4,too cleverly sly for it's own good,"Kim Henkel: What were you thinking? Did you think people would ""get"" what you were doing and enjoy this black comedy for what it was? Right off the bat you hit us with your clever comedic nods the other sequels (very funny by the way) and the movie is filled with great little comedic gems. Then you ask your viewers to spot the ""easter eggs"" you included in this one and have fun with them. The final scene is especially filled with that sort of thing. But you know how fans can be. The original Chainsaw has plenty of die hard fans since it's now become 'art' and 'fans' is short for fanatics and I don't know too many fanatics with a good sense of humor. You tried though - and you even hit the mark most of the time. This is very fun and very funny. Thanks!"
1,Crap,"Pure crap.A very massive disgrace to the texas chainsaw series.No plot,no interesting characters,leatherface is god awful,just portayed horribly.Avoid at ALL costs"
1,A slap in the face to the horror genre,Leatherface is a crossdresser who gets b!**hslapped around constantly and kills nobody. Do I need to say anything else about why this film is a worthless piece of crap? Nothing but mainstream trash that disrespects the franchise.
1,Pure crap,"I'm already wasting time writing this. But, this movie is a discrace to horror movies everywhere. A negative 5 !!!!!!"
1,This is just sad...,"Can you give a movie negative stars? How about -5 stars?This movie should not have been released...It is such a pathetic attempt to recreate the origional TCM movie. I rewatched # 1 a couple of weeks ago and decided to try some of the other ones because it was so good. That was a mistake. This movie is just plain bad. Bad acting (Now I understand why Matthew McConaughey tried to stop its release). Very bad writing, and bad direction. Leather Face was just stupid. There was no suspence, no sitting on the edge of your seat, no anything. Some movies are so bad that you just laugh at them...this went beyond that, I wanted to cry. One more thing. This was obviosly made before Renee Zellweger had taken an actiing lessons, she does a terrable job. Although I thought Matthew McConaughey did a good job with what he had to work with. To sum it up...DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!"
1,Why can't i give this 0,"This is the worst piece of crap i've ever watched, as far as im concerned this movie doesen't exist and TCM goes from 1-3, i actually burned this after paying 3 bucks for it, i would't even accept this for free it's that bad. The Remake is the return of Leatherface, screw this sequal it's to bad to even be acknowleged."
1,The most stupidest horror movie of all,THIS MOVIE IS GOD AWFUL. I MEAN POOR RENE ZELLWEGGER. BEING CAST IN THIS MOVIE. WHAT DID SHE TURN DOWN IF THIS IS WHAT SHE PICKED. DON'T GET THIS MOVIE SEE IT ON TV. DON'T EVEN RENT IT. DON'T GET IT PLEASE. I'M SAVING YOU 12 BUCKS.
3,Well..,"I guess this was supposed to be a remake of the original and not a sequal. You can see alot of resemblances of the original, but that doesn;t mean it's as good. The first 45 minutes of the movie is actually very good, but after the ""family dinner"" scene, which it seems every TCM sequal has-- got very boring and dull.If you are a TCM fan, definitely get this. You won't be dissapointed, but then agn you won't be very excited. (unless you like to see Rene Zellweger running and scraming)"
5,why the bad reviews?,This is actually my favorite of the franchise. And its actually funny. It has a great cast like renee zellweger or mathew mconahay(can't spell it haha) I give this a 5 stars.
2,Inferior compare to others,"This movie is watchable, but barely. Its not on the same level of the other chainsaw versions....and see leatherface as a....never mind, youllhave to see for yourselves. We have a yound Renee Zellweger in this one."
2,"""Welcome... to myyyyy world!""","...And it isn't pretty. ""The Next Generation"" is a stain on the legacy of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. ""The Next Generation"" is a campy attempt to emulate Tobe Hooper's masterpiece , only ""The Next Generation"" has virtually no gore, creepiness, realness, grittiness, and hardly enough entertainment to keep one from falling asleep during the duration of the film. The only thing worth watching in ""The Next Generation"" is Matthew McConaughy's tongue in cheek acting as a psychopathic, sadistic, and wife beating hick. Otherwise, this poor and increasingly bizarre adaptation of TCM tries too hard to shock its audience while disintegrating into pure incomprehensible nonsense.Stick with the TCM films directed by Tobe Hooper as well as the remake and leave this one to rot in the garbage bin where it belongs."
1,wanna know why sequels get a bad name? just watch this film!,"i have to give credit to this T.C.M, at least you could see what was going on in this movie. although that's the only thing this film had going for it! the acting just wasn't there, i mean i could shoot a home video with better acting then that! and the ""stunts"", where do i even begin? all i want to know is, why the hell are we suppose to believe that hitting a teenager three times with a stupid little twig- that didn't even have enough force to knock out a mouse- was suppose to knock the teenage chick out cold? i'd tell you to go out and rent the original if you're looking for a scare, but the truth is the first isn't any better!"
1,As Bad As You Think It Will Be,I thought this movie would be a good ending to this series... i was wrong. This movie left out important facts from all of the other three movies. It was aa embarrassment to Renee and Mathew and must have been a low budjet spoof or something. It isn't worth the money to see it and it shouldn't have been made. I hope they put out another one that makes more since and is more like the first one. If you want a good rental then go rent part one or one of its two better sequels.
1,The lowest moment in cinematic history.,"It's amazing that anyone involved with such an awful film actually ""made it"" in Hollywood. This fourth installment in the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" series is the worst yet. The first was a classic. The second was a failed attempt at dark comedy. The third was a boring mess. The fourth is COMPLETE TRASH. It is boring, lame, poorly acted, incompetent, and most unforgivenly: NOT SCARY. In fact little blood is even shown on screen. No wonder studios didn't want to release it."
1,AVOID AT ALL COSTS,"This is awful. The producers should have burned the negatives and collected the insurance money. It even repeats some of the same scenes from the first movie, [...]This was a movie that did not need to be made. Watch the original and avoid this like the plague. Possibly one of the worst movies ever made. I have to give props to Matthew and Rene for going on to successful careers after this garbage. That is a miracle!"
1,CAUTION: KEEP CLEAR,THIS IS WITHOUT DOUBT THE WORST FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY WHOLE LIFE IT GIVES ME PAIN IN MY HEAD JUST THINKING ABOUT IT I HATE WRITING THIS REVIEW BECAUSE IT REMINDS ME OF WHAT I SAT THROUGH ALMOST THROWING UP IT WAS SO BAD. I CANT DESCRIBE IN A BILLION TRILLION YEARS JUST HOW BAD IT IS DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE PLEASE STAY AWAY.
4,"Way Better Than Part 2 & 3, But Can't Beat The Classic!","The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation is way better than Part 2 & 3. However it isn't better than the original nor the remake! This one I believe was written by the co-writer of the original! The writer has brought some scenes from the original to this version which I loved! I especially liked the fact that Renee Zellewegger & Matthew McConaughy were in it! This was one of McConaughy's best performances, and this was I believe Zellewegger's break out film! They were great in it! It was hilarious having the fact of Leatherface as a cross-dresser! I enjoyed this film from beginning to end!"
4,"A SCARY MOVIE, BUT WERE'S THE MASSACRE","It was a scary movie about being trapped with Psychos and had a nice menecing tone, but the title sucked. There was no massacre, with or without a chainsaw. A bought this thinking it was going to be a good blood bath movie, but what I got was still interesting."
1,What is this?,"Plot-impared, badly acted, bad scrpit and timing make up this really bad scary movie that really has no real point. I really thought it was a waste of time sequel to something that wasn't that good anyway. You would have to be as sick as the family featured to enjoy this. One star is too high of a rating. A give it a BOMB."
1,"Pure Garbage, A disgrace to the series","I have never been so dissapointed with a movie in my life. To start with it made absolutely no sense whatsoever. Who was that guy in the limo and what did it have to do with the movie??? Who knows. I enjoyed parts 1,2 and 3 and consider them to be some of the best horror movies ever made. Part 4 is a piece of garbage. I know they hadn't done blockbuster movies like ""A time to Kill"" or ""Jerry Maguire"" yet, but why on earth would two accomplished good actors like Matthew McConaughey and Renne Zellweger agree to this trash? I agree with the other guy, Plan 9 from Outer Space is no longer the worst movie ever made."
2,not good,"this is a decent movie but just is predicable, uneven performances, and lost its effect that the earlier ones had of this series."
1,very silly,very silly movie..I thought it just like the TCM I II III but I was wrong there is no point at all with this film
3,Booger sure picked this one apart,"I have a completely different view than that of the infamous Booger. He sure picks and picks at this movie. He's mad there is not enough blood and gore in it. Booger has a problem. As a fledgling mass murderer, of course Booger wants more blood and gore. I say kudos to these film makers who decided to do a horror movie without a bunch of killing, blood and gore. This is like a Hallmark movie. So take that Booger, and quit picking at this one until your nostrils are raw."
2,Lest we forget...,"Yes, this movie is poo-poo. There's no denying that. But to all the people who are outraged that Leatherface dresses as a woman, I feel that they should be reminded of a few facts. The inspiration for Leatherface, Ed Gein, cut the skin off of dead women and made a whole suit that he wore on a regular basis. Just like Buffalo Bill (Silence of the Lambs) and Norman Bates (Psycho), were crossdressers, and also based on Gein.And the fact that in the original, Leatherface had his ""pretty lady"" mask with lipsick and other make-up on when he was cooking supper.I wonder if the picture on the DVD cover of Renée Zellweger was taken when she realized she still had a career after being in this turd of a movie."
1,Oh My God!,"This was the absolute WORST horror movie I have EVER seen! I swear I laughed in the last half part of this movie because it was so freaking ridiculous. I also seriously expected the scenes to be cut and have some remark made that this was just a joke and that this was exactly a horror movie should not be made. Well, I'll never rent it again... unless I want a really good laugh. But hey, I have to give props to Leatherface for making me laugh when he applied lipstick and acted extremely feminine to the point of hilariousness."
3,Get the other dvd edition!,"This is the one you either love or hate. Most appear to hate it.I, however, 'get' this film and actually love it. However, don't buy this reissue as several scenes that were in the original ""Return Of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" version were cut from the 1997 ""Next Generation"" release; and this is the edited '97 version. The out-of-print Canadian import on Maple (but around on the internet) edition includes the deleted scenes. Other differences--this reissue is set in 1996, the other in 1994, an alternate opening credit sequence, etc. All in all, if you're a diehard TCM fan you'll want both dvd editions, but the complete version is obviously better."
1,"Tobe Hooper, are you listening?","Director Kim Henkel claims that this is the ""official"" sequel to the 1974 classic - but this stinker doesn't do the original justice. It sat unreleased for over four years, then was let out of the can to capitalize on the latter-day success of Matthew McConaughey and Renee Zellweger. They needn't have bothered. Again, young folks are attacked by a backwoods family of bizarros. Henkel updates the story from 1974, and throws in some new elements, but this mess never gets off the ground. I was fooled by the trailer, which looked great. But you can skillfully edit a trailer to make the movie look really good. At least Mr. Henkel can take a bow for that."
1,"Why, Matthew? Why?","Oh, it's a sad day for all Matthew McConaughey fans who watch this sorry excuse for a thriller. I was expecting something decent, you know? That's all I asked for. I figured, ""Hey, it's got his name on it. He wouldn't agree to a project that would shame his career, would he?"" Apparently my darling Matty has no qualms about making a fool out of himself in front of the eyes of the public. Oh, I'm crying even thinking about it. I suppose you might enjoy this one, if you relish the sight of psychotic tow truck drivers w/ mechanical prosthetic legs throwing around helpless teenage girls, followed by a lot of whooping, barking, and screaming. Call me crazy, just not my kind of thing. So do yourself a favor. Keep away. Any existing good opinions you may have will surely be diminished by the exciting (sarcasm) finale of this painfully pathetic film.P.S. I would've given this a rating of zero stars if that were a possibility. A single star is far too generous."
5,Awesome figure!,This is very good figure as he has great sculpting and a incredible likeness as its pretty movie accurate. I recommend Marvel Movie/Marvel Legends/Spider-Man figures for age 10 and up due to the fragileness nature of the figures. Bottom line this is a must have figure if you are a big Fantastic Four fan! I strongly recommend this figure!
2,"Not the best, but not all bad","My spouse and I bought this CD to practice dancing the fox-trot. Only tracks 7-10 work for the ""slow-slow, quick-quick"" fox-trot. The CD sleeve also discusses the faster ""one-step"" fox-trot, which the majority of the CD is more suited for. People who are just learning fox-trot may find the songs with the faster tempos too difficult to dance to. Overall, though, it's an ok dance CD."
3,"OK CD, but songs differ from those described","The surprising thing about this CD is that the list of music included (same list here on Amazon.com and in the packaging) does not correspond to the music on the CD. I do not know all the pieces listed, but there are 14 items instead of 11. For certain, none of the following appear: Tie a Yellow Ribbon, Mack the Knife, It's Delovely. There is a catchy little number at #13 which seems to be related to the bumblebee tuna advertsing jingle."
3,Decent foxtrots for the money,"Bertone's Ballroom Orchestra is pretty decent. This disc is better for listening than for dancing. Current competition standards encourage a range of about 28-33 bpm for foxtrot, and none of this falls into a useful practice range.If you have a big floor, and people don't mind a faster tempo, this could be fun for parties. The ninth track is a fast (38 bpm) and very danceable recording of ""Its delovely.""Here is the title, duration, and beats per minute:1. It's All Right With Me, 2:28 (23 bpm)2. Top Hat, White Tie And Tails, 2:24 (24 bpm)3. Eyi Wala Dong (That Happy Feeling), 2:58 (24 bpm)4. Tie A Yellow Ribbon 'Round The Old Oak Tree, 2:54 (26 bpm)5. So What's New, 2:35 (26 bpm)6. Swing With Me, 3:30 (27 bpm)7. Mack The Knife, 2:55 (35 bpm)8. Let's Face The Music And Dance, 3:05 (38 bpm)9. It's De-Lovely, 2:15 (38 bpm)10. Rose Marie, 2:35 (40 bpm)11. Fascinating Rhythm, 2:30 (43 bpm)"
5,A good introductory manual,"Skip the manual and read this book instead. Text is appropriately detailed and clear. Many illustrations and examples. Overall, the book is a great introduction to the program and a good reference. However, this is not a step-by-step project guide or tutorial. Don't be fooled by the beautiful color illustrations in the middle of the book...this book won't make you an expert, only an advanced beginner."
4,Good Documentary on the British International Brigade's Role in the Spanish Civil War,"If you're expecting a full history of the Spanish Civil War, this is not for you. This documentary talks about the SCW from the sole perspective of the British International Brigade. You get firsthand accounts from both scholars and veteran British International Brigaders. The IB was made of of between 33,000-35,000 volunteers from about 52 different nations who traveled to Spain to fight on the side of the Republic (against Franco and the Nationalists) in the SCW. With this pointed focus in mind, this is a very good documentary, that also calls upon the art and many artists who participated in, died in, and/or created art inspired by the SCW."
1,Terrible view of the English Civil War,"I bought 2 copies of this program accidently because I thought they were both different. One on amazon.co.uk and the other on amazon.com. They haven't yet made a decent program of this war, not that it's a very interesting war, but it's odd that no one is prepared to make a docmentary about the only republican government in England and the only civil war if you don't count the war of the roses, which was more a dynastic struggle. Please someone in England I know it's a banned subject, but can you make a program about this war worth watching."
3,Product oriented Art,"I agree that this book is good in some ways. I like that it ties in children's books, but the projects tend to be oriented to ""one right answer."" I believe in projects that allow children to be artists, not imitators. I have used some of the ideas, but I have loosened them up so that kids get to make the creative choices and express themselves, rather than ending up with products that all look very similar. More art, less craft!"
5,A must-have,"Written by the editor of the Secrets of Paris newsletter, this book offers great advice on how to experience Paris and the Ile-de-France ""like the natives do."" Thorough coverage of travel practicalities placed in a well-written context make this a must-have for repeat visitors and new arrivals.ParisVoice Magazine"
4,Mind Opening,"I grew up in the anti-war vietnam era and always wondered how people could willingly go to war. This is the first book to help me understand the relationship between childhood games, pro-war movies/media fantasies and the harsh reality of ""waking up"" in a battlefield. The author's childhood romatic ideals of his father's war is shattered by his own experience in the damp jungles of vietnam. This as a must read for all young people and especially important in today's era of uncertain war."
1,terrible,"These nails didn't come in the original box, the box was double size and the nails were in a big plastic bag, literaly in a heap. I might get to use 20% of them, the rest are a mess. Some cartriges are in three pieces or more, some are missing nails in various places of the cartrige, and some have nails sticking up out of the cartrige. I think I received a bag of rejects. The time spent sorting out the good ones has been atrocious."
5,"This is a great toy,but you are only getting the Bull Rex",This has no picture.When I bought it said it came with a King Kong-it does not.It is the Bull V-Rex which is very cool.It eats the little people!Still a great value.
3,sounds weird,I would buy this toy but it just sounds so weird.Who ever said this toy sounds cool is a fool.But I rate it 5 stars because who doesn't like a toy dinosauar that eats people.
4,Kong Rules!!!,"This toy is awesome! I got it for Christmas and was amazed at the details! It is so cool how it eats the people, then you can get them out of its stomach. The roar is nice and loud and sounds cool. I would recommend this toy for anyone who likes the new king kong movie!"
3,Barbie Lunch kit,"I have always liked the lunch bags with a bottom zip compartment and seperate top zip compartment so that I can keep cold and room temp items seperate.I ordered the Barbie lunch bag for my upcoming kindergardener, assuming I was receiving the same color/design as in the picture. WRONG! Very disappointed to find that the lunch bag I received was that of a different Barbie design and color(s).I rarely have time to sit down at my computer, let alone read any reviews. However, had I done that, I would have seen one individual post that commented on the bag being different then the one shown.I am keeping the lunch bag only because I dont want to deal with the hassle that comes from returning items when purchased on Amazon.Note to Amazon....merchants need to display the correct picture of the item(s) to which they are actually advertising/selling."
4,Barbie Lunch Box Switch,"My daughter insisted on this lunchbox for kindergarten. Her lunchbox arrived, but she was devasted that it was the pink and limegreen lunchbox she had last year. I contacted multiple Amazon vendors prior to re-purchasing only to find that the one pictured is no longer available and the other one has replaced it. I give the lunch box in general 4 stars because of space and organizational ability."
2,Thermos Barbie Insulated Lunch kit,This lunch box was exactly what I was looking for but I was dissapointed when I opened it and it smelled of cigarettes. It smells so bad I will probably return it. I can't imagine putting my daughter's food in it.I've bought many things from Amazon including another lunch box and this has never happened before.
5,Blast from the past!,"Talk about a blast from the past, in this case, Toya's past as he encounters a girl who was with him before he lost his memory... of course, this can only lead to problems between Aya and Toya... definitely not a volume to miss! Be forewarned, the last few pages are intense, and you will WANT to have the next volume on hand before you finish this otherwise you will be screaming from the cliffhanger!"
3,Hmmm,"Ceres volume 8 is too... everything. This crazy volume is a pivotal one (well, they all are) in which we meet Miori, Toya's `girlfriend' from before he had amnesia. An OK read, this volume loads a little too much on sex and not enough on the Ceres-Progenitor factor.If you're a Ceres fan, it's a buy, but not a must buy."
3,Best but not the Best,"I love Ceres Celestial Legend. In fact, I love all of Yu Watase's work. This book was a little intense though. If your a Ceres Celestial Legend fan, its going to be upsetting to read. It also has so many things happening in it that its hard to grasp everything the first time you read it. Even if i knew the what would happen in this book before i read it, i would still buy it. Its a good book...just intense. So even though its intense, upsetting, and has a lot of info crammed into it--- I still recommend buying it. If you skip this book and then read the next one, you might be completely lost..."
4,Good work on a difficult subject,"Good work by the author.The author gives a good account on a very difficult time specially with everything that was involved in it like religion, nationalism and German liberties.The author describes with efficiency the main characters in this conflict with great insight as to what they think, what they want to accomplish and how to do it. The only flaw that i saw in this book was that that the author sometimes add to many details and too many non related stories that sometimes i found myself reading a little faster to get to the interesting parts.But overall is a good book even tough it was written several decades ago"
4,recommended but with one intolerable flaw,"This book provides a fine overview of the subject and I recommend it. However, it is burdened with the infuriating weakness of presenting untranslated French, German, and Latin phrases within a book that is published for English-speaking readers. If I were an editor I would not tolerate it. First, the author is not justified in assuming that English-speaking readers have her command of foreign languages. For example, those of us who study science tend to know less in this area than those in the humanities. Two languages, maybe, but we seldom speak or write a third. Second, it is an inappropriate demand on the reader's time to translate these blocks of text for themselves. I did so, but I was as mad as Hell for having to take the time to overcome the author's carelessness."
4,Machiavellian machinations,"This is the best single-volume account of the Thirty Years War(1618-1648). The war was very complex but Wedgwood provides singularclarity. Other interpretations are possible, but her vision is strongand memorable. The Machiavellian machinations are head-spinning, one hasto read carefully, the reward is a solid understanding of not only17th C dynastic politics but how Medieval politics operatedbefore the rise of the nation state.Wedgwood is an old-fashioned historian like Gibbon, retelling the eventsin highly-readable prose, focused on the ""great men"". This can beproblematic, the Thirty Years War was more than just the decisions madeby a few elites - social, economic and other forces were at work. Hersources are almost all 19th century. There are no new insights on thewar, it is a retelling of established views. As a political narrative itis not only a great work of history but also literature."
4,Excellent General History but Slightly out of Date,"I want to first agree with what the other reviewers have said regarding the readability of the book, and Wedgwood's beautiful writing. I would like to add that for those interested in a general history that gives decent accounts of the battles, this is the book to get. Parker's book, while probably more up to date andthoroughly researched is not up to the task when it comes to detailing the fighting.I can't give it five stars as it is a bit outdated and so much new research has been published since. Still an solid general history and great choice for a first book on the subject."
4,Good watch for the money,"I've owned this watch for many years and keep replacing it when it dies. Typically the compass dial pops off, but a couple of times the electronics fried when the battery ran down. Once the watch died when I swam in salt water. In any case, I usually get several years of use before it poops out. For the money you certainly get a lot of features; I've been pretty happy but I think I might trade up after my current one bites the dust..."
1,Not sufficiently durable,"Good features, very accurate, but . . .Crown is not screwdown, occasionally came up and analog time would stop. I would have to reset.Even worse, the crown fell off or was torn off. No longer possible to set analog time. No crown means water resistance probably compromised."
3,timex men's t45181expeditions analog and digital combo watch,i bought it at amazonTimex Men's T45181 Expedition Analog and Digital Combo WatchGAMO Red Fire .177 Caliber Pellets (Tin of 150)thanks
3,Timex Expedition,"Good product. Only use some of the features. This is my second Expedition. The first one stopped running and now I will use it for the battery and maybe the strap. This watch has several colors, black, brown and the face color. My previous one had only brown and the face color. I use this as my daily watch."
4,Tried and True,"I just bought the third of this particular model in the past 12 years. I am a soldier, and the features of this watch have served me well in that time. The band has been changed a bit, and not for the better in my opinion. That is the reason I give this model 4 stars instead of 5. This is an excellent timepiece for use in the elements. It will not disappoint, and I highly recommend."
4,nice large face that is easy to read,"Well made and easy to read. Both with standard dial hands and digital time. nice metal case and back. Easy to program and set. I thought the strap was Velcro, which I prefer, because it is easier to get on and off, but, it is buckle type. strap is well made and looks like it is water proof.but, I'd prefer it to be Velcro. overall, nice camping and hiking watch, witch is what I use it for. I have found it to keep accurate time and it is good in water up to 100M."
3,"Good quality, but too small","I do like the bramd, nut thought thos watch was bigger. It's for someby tinny or a trekker woman. Its purposevis just not to damahe other nicer wathes when you go trekking."
3,"light weight, easy wearing","Nice device for the price. Very light on your wrist, which we hope doesn't mean fragile.Setting directions are only slightly convoluted, and the four buttons seem reliable. The band is some sort of robot-punchedfabric, and the clasp actually bends where the holes in the band are too tight. I took a leather band from a defunctTimex to use here instead, and am happy wearing this lightweight daily on the work floor."
5,Excellent and resisted clock..,"I have been using this Watch in a Hard Weather, and it has resisted fully.The color combination it's great.I recommend this watch."
2,Timex T45181,"This is a cool looking watch, but it has too many useless features that you will never use. To make matters worse, the instructions are totally, utterly and completely worthless. I am a college educated professional, and after one hour screwing around with this watch, I finally threw up my hands in frustration and returned the damn thing to Wal Mart where I bought it. Nobody can understand the directions, and it's impossible to figure it all out because the instructions that came with the watch are so poorly written. Nobody, not even my watch repair guy, can figure out how to set this stupid piece of crap. Furthermore, the icons in the digital window are so tiny you will need a very good magnifying glass just to see them and try to figure it out. I do not recommend this watch to anybody. Find something else."
1,Poor quality and design.,It's my second Timex combo watch and surely the last one. They do not last more than 3-4 seasons of light outdoors. I used the Expedition Combo for canoe camping for no more than 60-70 days altogether and already 3 out of 4 control buttons stopped responding. Besides the procedure for setting up the alarm is so complicated that I have to bring a manual on every trip.
3,does not last long,the button that you use to set adjust the time fell off after about 2 years. I've never had that happen to any other watch before.
4,Looks good and runs great,"Can see time in analog with date/day in digital, or other choices. Also nice to have basic compass if hiking."
2,unbelievable,"I have been wearing the Timex Expedition for years now. I like the dual display (hands and digital) and they seem to hold up quite well through all of my extreme activities. However, the price has gone up and up and is now almost out of control. I found this watch and the price seemed fair and I got it. I couldn't wait to receive the watch but when I did, it's all plastic now... They used to be made of metal and I'm doubtfull this will hold up. not much for the money"
1,Dead after three years,"I bought a Timex Expedition about three years ago. The buttons no longer work, the watch runs about five minutes slow, and the dial has corroded and leaves sores where it scratches against my arm. I paid nearly $200 for this thing, and I only wear it to the office, so it is very bizarre that it is in such horrible shape. I bought it here in France, but the store only gives a one-year warranty and it doesn't do repair work. I have a 30-year-old Seiko that still keeps perfect time, and I've got this three-year-old Timex that I might as well throw away. That's pretty bad."
2,too difficult to set,I wanted an analog watch with an alarm. the digital setting was too difficult to set for the person i was giving the watch to. the buttons on the side were very small.
4,"Economical, accurate, fully featured, but ...","This is my second watch of this kind. The first stopped working after a couple of years. I came back to it because it is economical, phenomenally accurate, and has all the features that I want in a watch.On the down side, as mentioned, the watch may break after a couple of years. In addition, the strap provided is not the advertised velcro strap but rather a conventional strap with a buckle. The strap guide broke on my last watch after a 18 months, and I had to replace the strap."
3,so so,well i found the instructions to set the time on this watch were way over my head so i had my bro set it for me and finally he got it set right. I like the looks of the watch and everything but i noticed the band on it makes my arm sweat and it really stinks after awhile.
3,It's Ok,I bought this watch for my son so he would have a good watch for boot camp....sad... it started falling apart in the first month
4,Working watches,I decide to purchase that watches because I receive a promo and they satisfy me Timex is a good brand.
4,Best Adventure Gear Watch for the price,"The features in this watch are exactly what is required if you travel globally like me. The 3 time zones which can be set in this watch is a nice feature. The backlight is adequate and the alarm is loud enough to wake you up. The only reason i didnt give this watch a 5 is beacuse of the strap. Though a nylon strap feels good, its not my preferred choice.But you can always replace the strap to any material you want afterwards, which i intend to do. Timex watches are always known for their long battery life and this watch doesnt dissapoint. I recommend this watch to anyone who likes adventure gear."
1,Disappointing!,"The first Timex Expedition Analog and Digital Combo was defective. The light stopped working almost immediately followed by two of the digital controls. The replacement watch was a little better, but the digital controls, again, only worked a couple of days. Local watch and Jewelry shops could not correct the problem. The instructions for the watch are poor at best. To Amazon's credit their return procedures are excellent and credit and replacement is handled efficiently and quickly."
3,"Mediocre for class, not bad for a reference","I actually taught a junior level class from this book. I didn't like it for teaching. It felt like I was doing Electric Machinery Details, not Fundamentals. Curiously, my copy of this book has been floating around work for awhile now, and gets used quite often...mostly because it does have lots of details. Between this book and the Shaum's outline for electric power systems, it seems to get almost everything done.In short, if you could pick this book up for cheap (say below $40-$50), then I'd consider it. Otherwise I think you can collect a few other books out there out of the used sections and get the same job done.Just as a matter of record, I think more than $100 for any book is just plain outrageous (and I won't pay it). So you can use that as a gauge for how much this book is worth to you."
2,I don't like it.,This book is very poor in content. To understand it you should have some knowledge of electric machinery and then this could be considered as a complement to that. For introducing anybody to the behavior and functioning of electric machines this isn't the right book to choose. Its drafting leaves much to be desired. For me it's boring and not-well explained.
5,Best re-recordings of original 78's I have ever run across!,"We hear many re-recordings of swing era music which are taken from film sound tracks or radio outtakes, which are similar to the original 78RPM recordings. These tracks, however, had to come from original material. Every note is the same as I grew up with in the 30s and 40s, even the sour notes, which you will hear if you really listen.My hat's off to whomever recorded these tracks. All of the 78's hiss and scratch is gone, the screech of the brass is almost nonexistant and the bass has been brought up beautifully. You have to have listened to the original 78's to appreciate the job that has been done.If you like swing era big band jazz, you will not find a better place to spend $25."
3,Nice Compilation-Mini Box Set,"This is a fairly decent mini-box set of some swing artists, but it is by no means a large collection or an indepth overview of the Swing Era. It is, however, a nice little collection of some of the main showman groups of the Swing Era. The crackle sounds from the original vinyls are a nice touch and the quality of the mastering is pretty good. There's some really nice highlights like Ellington's ""Caravan"" and Shaw's ""Stardust"". It's a great intro set to anyone who is just getting interested in Swing."
2,Not what I was hoping for,"At the time of writing this review, I am the only one (out of 7 reviewers) who has not raved about this book. I was very much looking forward to receiving the book, largely based on the other reviews. But when I got it, I was disappointed enough that I actually returned it. Already a believer in the importance of fantasy play, I felt Gussin Paley was preaching to the choir, and I wasn't interested in only reading transcripts from children's fantasy play. The book is very thin to begin with, but without the transcripts there wouldn't be enough to form a book. I was hoping for more insights into how to encourage group fantasy play for the children in my care and how I might direct them most efficiently. Perhaps I would be better off ordering the Tools of the Mind book."
4,Thinking like children,"This books offers a valuable examination of children's thinking and learning and should be at the top of every educator's ""to read"" list."
2,Looks good and falls apart about as well,"Okay, I'll be nice, the thing does look good and the sound is exceptional (transmission and reception), but the comfort level, which was what I thought would be great coming from Body Glove, was horrible. I twisted and bent the arm that goes behind your ear to perfection and I still never felt like it was going to stay in place. The thing is VERY light, which should be a good thing but I felt it moving every time I did. Finally the darn thing just fell apart. One minute I am talking...I get home, tell my friend I will call him back, I disconect it from my phone and go to take it off my ear to find that the receiver bit is still in my ear!!! To the trash it went. Buy the. Yes it looks wierd but it fits, sounds great and the rubbery ear thing rarely comes off. It does come off but not enough to bug. Either way avoid this product."
2,hard to wear with eye-glass or sun-glass,"(+2) plug to phone securely, not loose like cheap models.(+2) ear-bud hears clearly, and mic speaks clearly.(-1) mic is a little too sensitive and pick up noise.(-1) comfortable w/o glasses, but hard to wear with glasses."
1,I'm disapointed.,I expected a working quality product that lived up to its advertising. The sound quality was poor both to the wearer and to the person I called. The phone plug is too thick and prevents the cover from being pull down. I would say that it is not compatible with the Nokia 7000 series phones. I am returning it for a refund.
2,"Looks cool, sounds great, hard for others to hear","The Earglove is a cool looking hands free gadget, no doubt. The little neoprene dealies are purely aesthetic but I suppose style counts for something. And it is comfortable to wear, also giving you good audio quality on your end. People on the other end of the line tell me that it's hard for them to hear, however, making it pretty much worthless to me."
2,too cool,"the unit fits me quite well, the incoming sound is clear and loud, and the on/off feature is cute. But, according to almost everyone that I have called using this accessory, it is very diffcult to hear me. i cant figure out what the problem is...maybe they cut down its mike sensitivity to eliminate extraneous sounds...anyway, they need to figure out what many others have suceeded in, that being to get the mike to be sensitive enough to pick up voices efficiently.the styling is nice, and have had no quality problems. but, I just cant make myself heard."
3,"Worked great, when it stayed plugged in","When I bought this, I thought that it was really cool. I could change the faceplates on my phone and the colors on my hands-free device. Well, it started to come unplugged in the middle of conversations, which was very annoying. Then, one of my covers split down the side.If you get this, I would suggest picking a cover and sticking with it. If you mess with it too much, it might tear."
5,The kind of homemade rock that memories stick to,"...and that you end up wincing to hear the words to, and maybe get a little too caught up in the biographical drama of it all than is healthy...or maybe that's just me ;)...if you've never been to Stereo Mountain, though, this one's as good a guide as any...think of it as the ""Rumours"" of Moncton or something ;)"
4,Mariachi from Mexico,"super clasic traditional music of Mexico - best music for my restaurant""Hacienda"""
4,Mariachi from Mexico,"I wanted to give Mariachi music a try after hearing some in a film recently and found this CD on Amazon. It is a pretty good album with a fine selection of tracks and apart from the odd 'cheesy' one here and there they are all very listenable and upbeat. Overall this album conjures up the atmosphere of Mexico and Mariachi and leaves you with a grin on your face, I don't know why but this music has the ability to lift my spirits every time I hear it. A good selection of music at an unbeatable price and well worth a try if this music intrigues you, you won't be disappointed.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
4,Ola ce pasa?,"You know what I love about this kind of music?I'm glad you asked! It's so uplifting and happy and the musicianship is fantastic.These guys have played this kind of music from a very early age so you can understand why they are so good at it.The tempo on some of the songs can be quite tricky when you have a close listen, but hey I digress just sit back and enjoy it for what it is, great music for the heart."
3,Engaging but...,"Yes it was engaging but still strangely unsatisfying. Mary Wesley's novels always intrigue but the characters in this one annoyed me. I much prefered Harnessing Peacocks, the Vacillations of Poppy Carew and the Camomile Lawn."
3,"Deeply anticipated, deeply disappointing","I looked forward tremendously to this book because of my interest in the history of the evolution of the idea of the ""big bang"". Surely, the ""big bang"" was as great an event intellectually as it was physically.There is much to commend in Farrell's collection of innocent facts in this book, but it is seriously marred by the sloppiest scholarship I have ever encountered. Viz., on p. 69 Farrell knowingly speaks of ""Alfred North"" Russell, whom he later describes as codeveloper of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Words fail.Again,on page 76 he gives the EFE and claims that the terms are summed over indices, which they are clearly not."
3,"A start, but by no means definitive","I checked this book out from the library in hopes of learning more about Lemaitre, and up to a point I was satisfied. Certainly, there is more biographical information about the man than I have seen elsewhere, and there were interesting sidelights about Eddington and Gamow. However, this is in no way a definitive biography, and as mentioned by at least one other reviewer, the explanations of cosmological models given are quite inadequate and downright confusing at times. This whets the appetite but does not satisfy."
5,George IV Comes to Life!,"George, Prince of Wales (later George IV), rebels against his puritanical father as soon as he is able. He takes mistresses, eats and drinks to excess, gambles, and joins forces with his father, the King's, enemies, the Whigs. Soon, Charles James Fox and William Brinsley Sheridan are running his life. Then, one night at a performance of Shakespeare's ""A Winter's Tale"", he sees Mary Robinson playing Perdita. She becomes George's first official mistress, among several in his lifetime.This book gives an accurate portrayal of aristocratic life in the eighteenth century. It also gives you an inside look to the lives of some of England's most celebrated personalities. Although many of the characters could hardly be called admirable, this book is an excellent choice for anyone interested in the time period or English history in general."
3,walmart special,i have this little sign and i actually found it at walmart! it was only a few dollars too... certainly not worth the money being asked for by the seller. sorry!
1,"Fat, greedy man.","Thirteen bucks for 2 songs, one of which appears on the main album. I guess Gilmour does have a lot to ""Smile"" about... the foolish, gullible fanboys who continue to support his mediocre garbage.Roger Waters is the only man responsible for PF's themes, lyrics, albums, concepts, melodies... and Gilmour's career. It's Roger's pig. It's Gilmour's fog machine."
3,Love on the Run,"LOVE ON THE RUN started off as a good book. I enjoyed Bree Hart's character because she did things just fo the excitment of it. The part that bothered me was when Graham and Bree started to fall in love. It got REALLY corny after that. I'm not saying this to down anyone, but thing don't always end up in marriage. In my opinion the story was a little unrealistic. Like I said before, it was a good book, but I expected more from it."
5,"Exellent retro rockabilly, that sounds vintage!","This music is great, because it sounds as if it were recorded in 1956, and yet you get todays great sound quality, and a singer whose style and voice sound right out of 1954! He really sounds authentic and looks it too. This cd is a classic for it also matches Gordon with 50's r&r guitarist Link Wray, adding to the authenticity of the original rockabilly comback man, Mr. Gordon. It's a shame Gordan doesn't start singing again, the way Setzer recently has, it would be a real treat. Well in any case treat yourself to some really good Elvis(& I mean the ""sun"" Elvis) inspired(but not copied) singing, and some awesome rockabilly."
1,This is one sad movie,"This movie is little more than a parody of the espionage genre. Ridiculous and extremely confusing plot, stereotypical characters, pitiful screenplay, poorly filmed ... I could go on and on but what would be the use? An example of the pathetic story: Michael Caine and Jason Connery are tossed off a train in the middle of Siberia. After five minutes of walking along the train track they suddenly find themselves in an airport outside a teeming city, where they get the last two seats on an airplane. Then, the airplane runs out of gas and serenely lands in a cow pasture where all the passengers grumpily exit the plane. This was just one of a series of scenes that were not only mindless but unexciting.This movie was so bad it defies belief! Spend your money elsewhere!"
4,"beside some of the rauncy lyrics, the CD is excellent","This is the best Cd from R. Kelly yet. Though some of the songs could need a R-rating before listening to them (""Dollar Bill""), most of the songs are easy to groove to. R shows all of his musical styles from the gospel-inspired ""I Believe I Can Fly"" to the West-Coast flavored ""Ghetto Queen"". This is heis best work yet, but I believe the best is yet to come. He has really grown as an artist and I can't wait for his tour to come to a town near me."
2,creative flow,"i am not an r.kelly fan. i don't have posters of him up on my wall. i don't know every little of trivia about it, but i respect him as an artist, and i love him for his persistence to be a COMPLETE ARTIST!. his last 3 albums have taken me down avenues i've never thought of venturing into. his last album should be considered a landmark in modern day 'soul/r&b/funk'. he is a writer, composer and a vocalist. very rare in this day and age. with all that in mind, i have to say R is possibly the worst album i've heard this year. i was expecting so much, i got so little. when the beats are strong, the lyrics are weak and vice versa. he's matured as a songwriter, but the album shows his lust for money. he basically sold out. changed the style, and didn't look back. r.kelly fans, don't hate me. maybe next time he'll remember where his roots are, and where he came from. think about it objectively."
5,Double the listening excitment!!!,"This CD is offf tha hook! Kelly is the man. This CD really is better than the last one. Not to say that the last one wasen't good, but this one is 5 times better overall. He has hip-hop tracks, ballad tracks, and some soulful r+b tracks that will suprise anyone that has been keeping up to date with R.Kelly's music. Out of the 28 songs on this album at least 17 of them are real solid. It is worth it. Some tracks like ""sucide"" and ""one man"" tell a story of someone going through certain things in a relationship and make you wonder if it's about kelly. Over all, every one of these songs are dope! Favorite songs are: One Man, Home Alone with Kelly Price and Murray, sucide, When a woman is fed up , eccetra and others. Too many to name!!"
4,2 many songs...,"This album is great. ""I believe I Can Fly,"" ""Home Alone,"" ""I'm Your Angel,"" and ""if I'm with you"" are the best songs on the album, however, ""We Ride,"" is the tightest track. I think R Kell did a great job on this cd. Only thing is there are to many songs on this CD. In some songs, he repeats the chorus continuously, but on whole it's a good CD. Worth having in your collection."
3,3 stars for the three good songs on the album!,"The three songs on the album that are any good are either too long or not enough rapping, he just sits there and like moans. Whats that about? This album is a joke that needs to be improved. He needs to get away from other people and make up his own songs."
2,"some well-crafted jams, but we've heard this before","the new r. kelly double c.d. chock full of guest rap and r. and b. stars packs a few moments of funk, but honestly, mr. kelly. you did all this before AND better with public announcement, plus the earlier solo cds. and by constantly reiterating about his bank account stupidly justifies the reason why he made this a double cd. it may be platinum on the studio wall, but is it platinum in the mind, body, and soul? we don't need r. kelly rapping without any poetic style and shamelessly brag about your womanizing. sadly, we have the puff daddy to do that. at least he copies off other people, but self-parody? you're much more gifted than that."
5,Good Music,"I would rate this song with the cd a great album. Of what he done like Looking for Love, I believe I could fly, and more. About he shouldn't do anything bad things like he has done, he was doing well he should keep it up. I'm not telling what do at all of my life, just what is right. Keep Man a lot of girls might still love you. I'm 16"
5,This CD Is Da Bomb,"I'm not a real fan of R Kelly, but this CD, is really something. With it's booty shakin' dance tracks, and mellow ballads this double CD set is well worth the $20!"
1,R. Kelly,I DIDN'T GET TO ENJOY THE C D BECAUSE IT WAS STRATCHED WHEN I GOT IT. I HAD TO SEND IT BACK TO THE SENDER.
1,Bad,"The 2nd CD for this disc had R.Kelly's logo and album info on it, but when played, it was actually a kid's Christmas album???!!!"
5,Rated R. for ...realness..tight!,"This cd from R.Kelly is good. Iknow some people say they heard it already but ...if u listen a couple times u will hear how fresh some of these beats and songs r. I think he really did it with this one. He is already 5 Xplatnium and counting. I heard he also has a new cd coming out soon. Since he made this he been busy making hits for others..so it should be good to see whta he's coming with next. The first disc caught me first ..the second has a couple but took a while to catch on to me. Some songs might sound like he's bragging..but I think he was just trying t to ""Keep it real""...but songs like ""If I could turn"" show how much he can get into with his songs. Don't sleep on kelly.......listen for yourself and u be the judge.Get it!!"
2,WHAT'S UP R.KELLY?,"I was shocked when I heard your latest CD. Why must you exploit women? I would like to know are you going to do any more duets. I think you should sing a song with the girl Miracle, the one that was on your tour a couple of years ago. I like your voice and I think that you too could make great music together, or would Sparkle get jealous. It's just business and besides, there's nothing like a good love song."
5,mind-boggling,A friend of mine has turned me onto R & B and gave me this CD to listen to and it totally blew me away- I am a diehard rock fan but this CD has shown me that there is other music out there!
1,R-SURE WENT TO F- IN THIS C.D.,"R-KELLY HAD IT ALL...THAT IS UNTIL HE SOLD OUT AND IS TRYING TO PLAY BOTH FIELDS(old school,remember howLUTHER used to be??)IF U WANT A GOOD C.D.THAT TOOK R-KELLY TO THE TOP AND THEN HE DROPED...GO BUY THE ''PUBLIC ANNONCEMENT"""" C.D. THERE U WILL FINDWERE R-KELLY SHOULD OF KEEP WITH!!!AND U WILLHAVE MONEY LEFT OVER TO BUY HIS EARLYER C.D.s WITH THEM...."
1,"Buy the single, not the album","If I had to do it all again, I would have bought the single for 'Home Alone' and skipped the CD. Most of the songs on this album are not enjoyable for listeners over the age of 20. 'Only the Loot Can Make Me Happy' is a rediculous remake of Surface's 'Only You Can Make Me Happy'. At least the Surface version was based on emotion, not materialism."
4,"Secular or nonsecular, that is the question!","R. Kelly's sound has evolved. He has grown musically and has proven that he can consistenly drop the hits. If you like 12 play, you will love the 2 cd joint. I just want to know if R. is trying to be down with the bump and grind or kick it with Kirk? Most fan are confused. Whatever the case, just be real."
4,IT'S SO SMOOTH,"We have waited for so long, but finally here it is: one fine piece of art. This music makes you really go down. I don't mind waiting another so many years for he brings his next cd out, I garantee it will be worth waiting, if it become as good as this."
3,"liked it, but not as much as previous albums","mr. ""r"" has shown that he has versatility but the album doesnt move me like his otherones did..there are a lot of songs on this, but i only really like a few of them...peace"
2,Everything sounded the same,"I listened to this CD expecting some nice beats and straight lyrics because R. Kelly has always seemed to put out some decent stuff, but not this time. Out of the 2 CD's, I could only get into like 4 songs. Everything sounded like everything else."
2,PLEASE!!!!!,"I have total disrespect for someone who swears that God is in their lives, do an article (Ebony) about the change in their life and then turn around and do a CD that describe their lust for money. I will give him props for ""When a Woman is Fed Up"" and the duet with Celine Dion. Other than that, he should have left the ""I'm Changed"" lie alone and stuck with his wild lifestyle. I had much more respect for him as a person then."
5,chapeau !,"This is what we say in french when deeply impressed! This CD is a jewelry, my english is poor so I can't express What I really feel inside. could anybody give me the true R.Kelly website or fanpage I'd be pleased.If R. or anyone of his sorrround see my message please tell him: MERCI ! Yrs steph."
2,would have been stronger single,"though r kelly is a talented song-writer,arranger and producer this two disc set is one to many.home alone,if i could turn back the hands of time and a few more songs make the cut.but it becomes more excess than substance.and way to many guests."
4,A very Good Effort from R.,"I am an Alternative music fan,but I have always been a big R.Kelly fan.I have had this album since February and I still like listening to it every once in a while.Some songs like Dollar Bill with Foxy Brown seems a little bit to edgy and not R.'s style.Its still a good album with good mix,my two favorite songs are the 2 kind of songs on the album,If I could turn back the hands of time,the slowest song on the album and Home Alone,the head bopping track with Keith Murray.Its a good buy"
2,He could've done a much better job!!!!,"To make a DOUBLE cd is one thing, but to make a MEDIOCRE double cd is sad!!! The only songs I really listen to are ""If I Could Turn Back the Hands of Time"" (the best song on the album) and ""Get Up on a Room."" Most of the other songs are fast-forward material. And please R. Kelly, STOP TRYING TO RAP ON YOUR SONGS!!! Leave that to the real rappers!!! I hope your next album is better."
2,R. Kelly,This album is another example of how artists want to go platinum easily by double CDing their album. There are songs that sound good and others that don't. He should have just made one CD. But I give him props because he is talented in what he is doing.
4,"R Kelly has a great album, but there are 2 many songs,","R Kelly has always been able to come up with well-crafted songs and it shows up even more on his latest album. ""If I Could Turn Back The Hands In Time"" will always be on my play list as long as I am alive. It is clearly the best song on this CD. R Kelly's new album is very diverse he goes from having a slow song with Celine Dion to singing the chorus on a song with Cam'ron, Noreaga and Jay-Z,(""We Ride""). Continuing R Kelly's tradition of well crafted songs is ""When A Woman's Fed Up"", which summarizes what's going on in a relationship when it's about to end. If R Kelly would have made this a single CD, I would have given him 5 stars, but you have to admit there are about 5-10 songs he could have left off this CD. ""If I Could Turn Back..."", ""Spendin' Money"", ""When A Woman's Fed Up"", and ""One Man"" make up for any failures. You make em, I buy em. You produce em, I buy em. The Sparkle album is also tight. Get Yours!"
4,Awesome......But not better than TP-2.Com...!,"This Album by the King of R&B;, R.Kelly, is definitive a Awesome One. He shows the world his range of all kind of music that he can do, Especially R&B.; For the most part of The Double CD its full of classic gems here. The Second CD is lil`less emotional because of the tracks: 4,6,7,8 and 10. The First 1 is CLASSIC, with the except of the track #11 which I didn`t like it.For the most part of the Whole ""R"" Album is great.But this album can`t be compare to HIS MASTERPIECE BLAZIN CLASSIC,TP-2.COM. But this Album is Also Very worth your money. If you don`t believe me check it out,""R"" Album has sold more than 7 millon copies inUSA alone. So go and Buy ""R"", ""TP-2.COM"" and all of his Albums."
4,"good music, but the worst packing i have ever seen","This is pretty good cd and most of the jams are tight and all, But why did they have to put it in such a awful case, The booklet is glued down and the there is goo all over the place, I was lucky I was able to salvage the discs before they were ruined, But I choose to listen to them in my old cd player rather then my new one that I had wanted to listen to them in.Has anybody else had this problem , Regerdless this a cheap and lowdown way to package a two cd set.The price is far too high, But It's got some good jams as stated above particuilly I belive i can fly Home Alone with Keith Murray and my all time favorite a Woman fed up. Buy this, but be prepared to be very dispointed in the packing and most likely never put the discs back in the case.This would have been five stars if it were not for the packing."
2,Why 2 CDs?,"First of all, everything ran together, I felt like I was listening to the same song over and over. He got down on When a Woman's fed up and the cut with Keith Murray, but other than that, straight garbage!"
3,One Man,"I think the overall Album was really good. I really identified with the song ""One Man."" Women world wide can truly feel that song, and it sincerely touched me that R/kelly sang it, also ""when A Womens Fed up"". These songs touched my soul."
2,When the songs were 5 minutes back in the 90's,"This album is da bomb,but why are the songs 3 minutes now in 2005.It is just hard to understand i hope r kelly makes his tracks five minutes next time. Good album though."
1,Not really widescreen,"One star just because the manufacturer can't get the facts right.I like this movie and wanted the widescreen version. After reading other reviews, I carefully checked the Amazon description. Yep, it said ""widescreen."" So I ordered it.When it arrived, I checked the package before opening it. Yep. It said ""widescreen,"" right there on the box.When I played the movie, I saw that dreadful message telling me that the movie was ""modified to fit my screen."" It was a pan-and-scan full-screen version. I even took out the DVD to make sure I wasn't playing the wrong side of a two-sided disc. Nope. It had only one playable side.I returned it to Amazon."
3,Video Set,"As often is the case, the sequels do not measure up to the original. This is especially true of Sniper 3. But you gotta love Berenger's portrayal of the main character. If you like Sniper, you will probably want Sniper 2 & 3."
1,This movie didn't work,"This movie didnt work when i got it, the sound was completly out and the picture faded in and out."
5,"One Shot, One Kill, One Awsome Movie",This movie is awsome.Tom Berenger is a great sniper who takes a rookie(Billy Zane) sniper to kill a drug lord. The end is great I LOVE THIS MOVIE!
5,This is the best damn movie I have ever seen!,"What can I say, it has great sound effects, great actors, and it really shows how a ""real"" sniper acts. Get the movie, you won't regret it!"
3,The best of the worst,"If you're reading these reviews and not getting why there are so many different opinions about this movie it's because of this:If there was a list of the best bad movies to watch, Sniper would be #1.The movie is loved by Sniper-lover-types because its the only one of its kind that tries to delve into what it's like to be a Sniper. Patience, Timing, Accuracy etc are all very well portrayed in this movie. And let's face it, there's not much Sniper-lover stuff out there.The movie is both loved and hated by regular everyday movie goers because it's story is wacky and the one liners are just as wacky. The overacting is hilarious and the insanity of it is too funny.I've watched it twice because I thought it was hilarious. It's the type of movie a bunch of pals would get together and watch and make fun of: no drama, no thought, just Sniper! The movie [...]in and kept me watching, which by my definitions makes it entertaining."
2,Better than Lord of the Rings?,"Well...I guess there really is ""no accounting for taste.""But, as they say, on to the movies. In a nutshell, I've seen Sniper I & II (please don't tell anyone), and even though I was foolishly naive enough to try it a second time, I'm really not dumb enough to waste money, or worse---time!---on Sniper III.But, in all fairness, if ridiculously contrived plots, canned comic-book dialogue, dubiously stereotyped characters, not to mention two hours of Tom Beringer's seething, rabid hatred of......uh, well, just about everyone (his standard MO evidently).......well.....nuff said?And, oh, if you're like me, i.e. assuming you'll get to see some actual long range tactical stuff (mil-dots, stalking/crawling, doping, ammo, sniper rifles, etc.)...think again. And go elsewhere.On the other hand, if you're a Tom B fan, and enjoy all the aforementioned contrivances and badass attitudes, well then...you're in luck. These movies won't disappoint."
2,WRONG ATTITUDE,"""Sniper"" could have been a good movie, but because the lack of details like; You need equipment and supplies which results in heavy backpacks if your mission is lasting for some days or weeks. Your infiltration might have to be done by foot, and that demands a lot, especially in high snow wintertime. You get tired, wet and cold(in my area) from time to time. You might have to lay still, waiting for your target for several hours or days. Since details like that are kept away from the story, my experience is that the movie has resulted a lot of people signing up for selection without understanding the hard work it is. This results 90% ""cowboys"" signing up, and only 10% with the right qualities So it might be considered as good entertainment, but nothing else."
3,New or Used ??,All three DVD's appear to have been repackaged. I do hope that these are not used items being sold as new
3,Seems like parts are missing,I believe that some of the movie has been edited out from the original release. I have watched this multiple times and it is a good movie.
2,Should have bought only the first one.,"Sniper ""one"" is a good entertaining movie. But the sequels are unnecessary.Tom Berenger gives his best, but the stories on Sniper 2 and 3 are weak.If you want to buy, do not buy the whole package."
1,No dolby digital?,"Last year when I rented Sniper from the movie store, I was excited about the movie because of its extraordinary sound. The dolby digital produced an ambience of jungle sounds that drew me into the movie's setting; much like the rain in Matrix. But be careful: this version has only dolby surround sound. Perhaps the best thing about the movie was not part of this deal. I was snookered, but only because I did not look closely enough at what I was buying. Watch out."
3,Sniper - Not the version I was looking for!!!,"The Picture Quality of this DVD is great!BUT:the back of the DVD Cover says the aspect ratio is: 1.85:1 WidescreenWrong!The Movie has only the aspect ratio of 4:3Too Bad, but i found the Dutch Release on eBay, containing the right aspect ratio."
5,Superb film,"I just recently viewed it again, and it remains one of the best war movies I've come across. Berenger and Zane are great in their roles, with an outstanding support cast. Director Llosa deserves just as much praise as anyone involved; he certainly knows how to make a thoughtful and very stylish flick."
4,Easily Digestible History,This is an easy read and gives you (in the background) a decent view of some historical events. I would have preferred more history and less romance novel stuff but it is a product of it's time.
3,Redit,Parts of this book were well written but most was written on a low literacy level more for older children rather than adults.
4,Through Russian Snows,"I read ""Mother"" by Maxim Gorky and was in the process of reading ""Through Russian Snows"" when my first Kindle locked up and had to be replaced.I give both novels high marks.Strangely, my account shows no record of these books and so I was unable to transfer them to my new Kindle.I'll have to check to see if I downloaded them as e-books through my laptop.Linus"
5,Very Helpful,This book is very helpful in studying the book that it goes with. If you honestly complete this workbook then there is no reason why you should get less than a 90 on any EMT-B exam.
2,brand new copy available. never opened,"I tried not to be too hard on the textbook version of this, but the workbook seems like a waste of money. If you can't pass the class without this workbook, you might consider another line of work. People's lives might depend on you being able to think for yourself."
5,Great book,This book was not required for class but helped me with all my exams. I highly recommend it for anyone going through an EMT program.
3,Satisfactory,"I am satisfied with this product. Seeing as this is a workbook, it would have been nice to know that all of the answers were going to be marked in the book. But overall I'm happy with the product. Thank you."
2,Answers aren't always correct,On multiple accounts so far through 13 chapters I've found the answers from the back to be incorrect. Be careful and read thoroughly!!
2,Not necessary,Did nothing to help me for the registry exam. Read the book and answer questions in the book and that is all you will need. The questions are too general and basic.
4,Purchased for class,"Got this book for EMT class, worked very well. A little expensive, but like most College grade class books, it seems they are always like this."
4,Great help in my studies,"I had a different edition of the actual textbook that my school required but that didn't matter so much. I used this book as a study tool and it made a huge difference in my comprehension and retention on the subjects. The chapters were in a different order (as I said, my textbook was a different edition) but with no difficulty at all I was able to locate the section I needed. I recommended it to some of my classmates and they were very pleased with the results and info in the studyguide. Answers and explanations are in the back of the book so when I went to check my answers, if I had the wrong thing down, there were in-depth explanations in the back. I would recommend this studyguide to anyone studying to be an EMT-B, even if your textbook is a different edition."
2,One of the worst of the Flashman series,"Fraser is at his best when Flashman is woven into intricate plots involving detailed historic events. Less interesting, boring, when involved in general history. This and ""...Angel of the Lord"" I find to be his two worst books."
5,Brilliant brilliant brilliant!,"Flash for Freedom is my second favorite Flashman book after the original Flashman. Set in the deep south before the end of slavery, it is an education about that part of the world before the Civil War, and also allows Flashman's casual brutality, cowardice, and cunning to really come to the fore.Read something recently that reminded me of Flashman,Hong Kong 97, A Corporate Satire. This book is set in Hong Kong in the 1990s, but the main character is a manager working for an American company. Hilarious."
5,my wedding songs,"Back in 1990, I received the CD as a gift from a friend. I liked the songs so much that I played the songs in my wedding banquet. Up until now I could not find a replacement for the friend. Being confused by the descriptions, I just now ordered two replacements, just in case:1. Tranquil Moods: Drift AwayVarious Artists2. Drift AwayHadley Hockensmith"
2,Dissapointing. I expected better from Kaplan.,This book is a glorified version of the downloaded preparation guide found on the NYSTCE web site. It is almost literally the same thing. I found that Barron's LAST/ATS-W NYSTCE book (0764123068) is a lot better. The only thing that this book is good for is that it has a practice test. Save your money and buy the Barron's book instead. Two stars is being very generous.
3,This is EASIER than the real exam,"I just took the exam. I believe that the sample exams in this book for LAST is actually easier than those questions in the real exam. This is not what I expected, I thought it should be at least the same difficulty level or harder. I was a little disappointed and I think I failed the exam. It was hard and I will go buy some other books to try it again."
4,Not a strong ending,I think the conclusion isn't as strong as it could have been but it was still a satisfying read.
3,Sour Ending,"Oh, I loved the sereies, but the ending left a lot to be desired. It seemed the story was actually very romantic, but they seem to shoot it all down at the end...can't really say how without giving the story away, but it was frustrating. It all seems to come down to Hideki being able to love Chi, not the other way around."
4,Excellent shoes!,"I've been searching everywhere for a ""plain"" shoe without too many ""lines"" on it as well as with a rubber sole. I came across a pair of black ones (or red?) and bought them but couldn't find the other color. I was very happy when I found them on Amazon. The shoe looks great and I use it at work (business casual) or when going out/dates/events. It is VERY comfortable. The only minor downside is that it is slightly expensive - when I ordered it, it was around $150. If it was $100 I would definitely give it the fifth star. Still, it is worth it - it is the most comfortable non sports shoes I ever had."
5,Good British cop drama!,"Detective Frost is a a little eclectic, prickly, rebellious, clever and smarter than the average bear. He digs until he finds the right answer."
2,Too bad! Gotta have subtitles or closed caption,"Please don't misunderstand - this is not a review.I would buy this series right away IF it had either closed captions or subtitles. And I am sure that there are many more like me who must have the ""writing"" to make up for poor hearing.Pity that so many of the top-notch shows from the UK have no writing."
4,I'm Hooked,"I'm now a fully envolved Frost fan. I've already pre-ordered season four. If you enjoy british mystery, this series does not dissapoint."
5,"Excellent Quality, Excellent Price!","Needed this extended flange to install our new Waste King 9940 Legend Series 3/4 HP Continuous Feed Operation Waste Disposer, due to the thickness of our fireclay farm sink. The fit and finish are exceptional; no stamped name or logo on the exposed flange rim, just smooth stainless steel! This flange sells for more than double this price elsewhere (as do extended flanges for most other disposer manufacturers). Installation of both the Waste King flange and disposer were a breeze, and we are thrilled with both the quality or value."
3,It fits barely,I had to purchase this because the one that came standard with the disposal was too short for my old cast iron sink. This one was almost too long given the screws that came with it. The screws are just long enough to hold everything in place with not a millimeter to spare.
5,Good service,"It turned out that this part was not required for my job, but it was delievered fast and I received a prompt refund."
1,Snap ring not included?,Lost the snap ring to this Disposer and needed a new one. I ordered a new flange just to get the snap ring. The Item pictured clearly shows the snap ring attached. I was very disappointed when I received the part without the snap ring.
2,does not come with cord,Be sure that you realize that this product does not come with the cord. I should have been more observant.
2,"good food, but a little pricey","The store where i used to buy this had discontinued it, but now I've found it in another store for half the price of the online price."
5,Solid...Wonderful Art,"Ireland's history is excellent. It covers all of the major points, and gives good insight into topics that rarely make a basic history. His commentary on the major battles, tactics, and personalities is excellent. His background chapter on the Royal Navy provides important instruction on sailing and naval vocabulary. However, wonderful art and illustrations really make the book special. All too often, excellent histories are undone because readers can't picture the events. Ireland solves that problem for us. Every page includes relevant illustrations. We see the ships; we see the men; our minds can build an accurate and detailed picture of the events. Given that, the absence of maps in strange and dissappointing. But that's about the only criticism I can level at this otherwise outstanding volume."
3,Thumpa thumpa thumpa thumpa thumpa thumpa thump clap clap clap,"After the success of 1982's HEY RICKY and the Grammy winning smash ""You Should Hear How She Talks About You"", Melissa Manchester and producer Arif Mardin decided to continue on the ""Flashdance"" tip for EMERGENCY. Manchester wraps her golden throat around quirky Fairlight synths, screaming guitar solos and thundering Linn Drum programming on such mid to uptempo raves as the title track, the minor hit ""No One Can Love You More Than Me"", the cute, girl group-like ""That Boy"", and the 80's video-ready ""City Nights"". Things slow down a bit towards the end of the album with the beautiful ballads ""White Rose"" and ""Time"". On these smoothies, the drum machines and scorching guitar leads take a break to allow Melissa's voice to really shine. EMERGENCY is not Manchester's best, but it's an interesting 80's timepiece."
1,PEICE OF CRAP DO NOT BUY,Ok now the first day i got this i was really excited. I took it out immedieatly and started playing with it. At first it seemed awesome and the shooting was pretty good. But when i layed it on the ground it just..SNAPPED!I was Like WTH. Well most of the outside was all open and stuff but somehow it could still shoot. So i was like ok... and played with it some more then it just stopped working... I definetly do NOT! Reccomend this gun. And its cheap so i guess you get what you pay for but ya still DONT BE STUPID AND BUYTHIS PRODUCT! DONT GET IT..!
1,Chesterton Poems,"Although this costs nothing, it is not worth downloading. I am familiar enough with GKC's poems to shudder when words and even whole lines are missing: e.g. in ""The House of Christmas""."
5,Best Boingo ever,Truly a studio masterpiece. Being a Boingo fan for over twenty years and seeing them live fifteen times has given me quite an appreciation for Danny and company. This CD is so completely involving you just get goosebumps every time you listen to it. The rhthyms are grand and the lyrics take on new meanings every time you listen. I am a DJ and have heard few albums that compare to this on a whole. Even a non Boingo lover would enjoy this one. Wonder what Danny thinks is his best album? I bet he would choose this one! I used to think that Good for your Soul was the bands finest hour (great horns) but upon repeated auditions Dark at the End of the Tunnel won out even though the use of horns is spare. This is music at its finest hour. Peace!
2,Boingo's worst,"Listening to Oingo Boingo you can tell that they are not a normal band, or would they have been considered that during their time. However when listening to this CD you get a feeling that for one reason or another they decided to give in to the popular music of the day. The result was disasterous. I think really the only song I liked on this album was ""Glory Be"". the rest of the songs are just your typical 80s style songs. and the last song on this CD drives me crazy, I can't stand to listen to it. The lyrics are mindless, the tune is like nails on a chalkboard. if you have never heard Oingo Boingo prior to this, PLEASE find a different CD to start with, They have MUCH better ones."
1,The worst Oingo Boingo album,"The album cover sucks. The songs are absolutely pointless from the angle of both melody and lyric. Try To Believe, Right To Know, Run Away, Long Breakdown - these all repeat lyrics over and over and over and over...you get the idea. The only things worth anything on this album are Skin and Out of Control."
4,acceptable flashlight,"This is a good flashlight. The rubber coating which serves to protect the flashlight does make it a little bulky for a AA flashlight. The beam is fairly narrow and that seems to limit its overall brightness. I picked up a couple of these discounted at Target, so I feel like I got a reasonable value, but if you would be paying the full price, the average person might do better looking at the products in the Energizer ""weather ready"" line."
5,Hard Case Flash Light,Item is a very durable LED flash light. I ordered one for the home and liked it so much I purchased this latest one for my truck.
2,I beg to differ,"We were treated to some outright classics in the seventies but we also got served up our fair share of lame pretenders. I didn't hear Flash the first time round but bought this on the strength of the reviews they were getting on Amazon.I have not heard other Flash albums so I do not know if this CD truly represents the band , but if you give this four or five stars then I guess ""Close to the Edge"" by Yes has to get 20.Flash are definately progressive and that they sound like the first two ""Yes"" albums is self evident but is that enough. ""Yes"" improved well past these fledgling steps.Flash seems second division to me and the singer is less than convincing. Sometimes the lyrics are clumsy and really pretentious. With so much great music out there to discover I don't know why you would tether yourself to this. Let's see, I could put on some early Genesis or Gentle Giant, maybe some Floyd or Groundhogs. No, I know, I'll get out me ole Flash album, I think not."
2,Flash should have called this one In The Pan.,"Sporting another politically incorrect cover to make your average feminist cringe, Peter Banks and Flash released their sophomore effort minus Tony Kaye's Hammond organ in tow. Banks' flashy guitar work fills much of the void in tunes like Lifetime and Black And White, but it's downhill all the way from there. After a promising debut, Flash falls flat on this one."
1,wild side,"It wasn't the version I thought it was. The love scene with Ann and Joan in the bed was cut out.Two weeks after ever seeing the movie was when Ann came out about her relationship with Ellen.I thought the movie would have been a nice collector item, for me anyway. Sorry!"
3,Jewlers Rouge,"The stick is very hard and you have to use a knife to scrap off small pieces to work with, but once it is broken up it does a good job of polishing."
4,One of Dean's Best.,"Shep is such a complex character. His seemingly effortless mode of closing out the world and yet be more in the world than anyone else around, made him very hard to forget."
1,This was the worst Koontz book! EVER!!!,"I have never thrown away a Dean Koontz book but last night I could not take it anymore! By Chapter 12 they were still riding around in Dylan's SUV, being chased by an invisible nobody and Jilly was still being an annoying, very dislikeable character.I knew I was not going to like this book when she was introduced with her plant ""Fred."" Her pointless chattering drove me crazy. I was thinking to myself ""Is Koontz for real?"" And then after she meets Dylan, she continously tries to bait him into arguements and they talk about nothing for over half of the first 100 pages!!!!Please, if this was your first time reading one of his books, this was one of his worst, give him another chance. Try Fase Memory or my all time favorite, Intensity."
3,Ending was somewhat disappointing,"I liked the whole premise of this book. It had a pretty good foundation. But I was very disappointed in the ending! The whole idea of forming a 'club' seemed childish, in my opinion."
3,So-So Koontz,"The first couple of chapters are hard to deal with. Unecessary character development and detail almost made me stop reading this book.But, hold on, it gets good. Dylan and his autistic brother Shep are injected with a mystery substance that unleashes some pretty amazing powers. At the same time, in the same place, comedienne Jillian is attacked and injected with the same substance. The three band together and share their individual experiences caused by the injection. Visions, teleportations and psychic warnings plague the trio throughout a harrowing 24-hour period. Most of the story revolves around them being chased by men-in-black type characters who have one agenda: kill the three of them as quickly as possible.The end was a bit of a let down, but for the most part, the book was exciting and kept me interested."
3,"""Slow moving plot--dismal characters--not scary""","This book along with One Door Away From Heaven lacked the urgency and helpless fear factor so needed in a horror story. I like happy endings, don't get me wrong, just not mushy endings like this and the former book had.The villain in this book, although a very bad man, was not scary enough, compared to the deviates in books such as: Intensity, or From the Corner of His Eye. The method the bad guy (Dr. Proctor) vandalized his victims was somewhat spooky, but the effects were dismal. I guess I've read too many of his better books, as well as books by S.K. to get to excited by such a mellow thriller. Keep writing Dean, but please try to scare me."
2,Major disappointment,"In ""By the Light of the Moon"", Dean Koontz violates Elmore Leonard's rule of writing #10---""Try to leave out the part that readers tend to skip."" There is a lot that can easily be skipped.Once you strip away the redundancies and verboseness, you will find a pretty suspenseful cat and mouse thriller. However, you must abandon 100% of your disbelief.The plot is at its most interesting when the focus is on the nanotechnology computers.Two of the three protagonists are almost interesting, but the autistic brother is truly tedious. The villains are evil and easy to dislike.For true Koontz fans only---and some of them may have a problem with this one."
2,Not like his usual,"I have attempted to read By the Light of the Moon several times on my commute to work. I have read many of Koontz's novels and this one is very hard to get into. I find the characters annoying and their constant bickering is very tedious. I have only read 100 pages, but I don't think I will waste my time reading more."
4,Great!,"There are three books I've read recently that I thoroughly enjoyed: THE DA VINCI CODE, BARK OF THE DOGWOOD, and BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON. While I did like ODD THOMAS better than BY THE LIGHT, I nevertheless enjoyed it! I thought the characters were particularly well developed and the premise was fascinating.Also recommended: The Da vinci Code, Bark of the Dogwood, In this Mountain"
2,Not the best Dean Koontz,I usually can't put his books down but this one I kept leaving. The lead characters weren't nearly as compelling as many of his others. For anyone who has never read Dean Koontz - please don't let this be your first! He is a terrific writer but this story just isn't as good as his other stuff. I trudged through this book wondering when would it end. Thankfully it wasn't very long.
3,By the Light of the Moon,"""By the Light of the Moon"" takes a while before it gets really interesting. At times, Koontz tries too hard to be funny, which results in some rather awkward dialogue. Some parts of the book are overwritten, with far fetched metaphores, which slows down the pace. Koontz's books are usually real page turners that I can finish in a day or two. This took a while longer because it wasn't quite as gripping as his best works. The ending, however, is spectacular. Some of Koontz's books ends rather abruptly, but I liked the ending of this one very much.""By the Light of the Moon"" is a bit uneven. It doesn't rank among Koontz's best works, but it's much better than his bad ones (One Door Away from Heaven, The Taking). Recommended to Koontz fans. Those new to Koontz may want to read some of his other books first."
2,No Thanks!,"Simple review Not even close to one of Koontz's great,good or even readable novels. Love the author but as usual he didnt tie the ending to the book or even give the ending any time to develop. Also that Jilly charachter not only does she have big issues, she carries around a plant for company that she holds conversation with but i hate her apperance everytime shes in the book i had to skip over her dialouge if she wasnt arguing with Dylan she was saying something that just made me dislike her more. Ive never had a charachter in a book where everytime it was their turn with dialouge i cringed. Koontz what the hell is going on?"
5,Each Koontz book is better than the last,"Another fantastic thriller from Dean Koontz with more than a little humour injected into it by way of the eccentric comedian Jillian and her pet plant.Unlike most books that try to combine chilling suspence and laugh-out-loud humour, this book succeed and really makes the cross-genre work. This is a brilliant novel that will have you laughing one moment and ducking under the covers the next.I would reccomend this book to all fans of Dean Koontz or of the thriller/horror genre especially if you like books to be scary but still manage to have a nice, lighthearted feel to them."
3,Good escapist chiller,"Good page-turner. I hadn't read a Koontz book in years and it lived up to what I expected, which was something escapist and a little bit chilling. Don't expect a hard-core fright fest here, just a mystery with a supernatural edge. Don't think too hard about the plot or you'll probably snag a loose end and unravel it! Oh, and speaking of metaphors, Koontz does tend to employ some really terrible extended metaphors in his writing -- but that's ok -- we don't read Dean Koontz to experience literary finesse!"
5,Simply Excellent,Outstanding book....a real page turner. You will not want to or be able to put the book down. A very enjoyable read. Highly recommended!
2,Worst Koontz yet,"As usual, Dean Koontz starts out strong, gets far-out ridiculous, and then ends it with the most dull, sappy ending. The characters in this story are also unremarkable and flat. To sum up, it stinks."
1,A BIG YAWN!,"Koontz's typical silly amalgam of anti-government paranoia and right wing propaganda (the good guys are warm and kind to everyone and hate Alec Baldwin, the non-governmental bad guys take drugs and believe in global warming). Simplistic fiction with nothing redeeming nor exciting.A plant crossing over the USA? C'mon guys, there are several better authors than Mr Koontz in all over the USA. Give them a chance instead of praising this rubbish pot."
1,Disappointed...,"I am a big Koontz fan having read all of his books. By the Light of the Moon was a big disappointment. The story's well written, and its initial premise was very interesting. However, as it developed it became very cartoon like and seemed to better fit a comic book (X-Men to be specific) than a Koontz novel. It would have been much better had it followed the suspense angle of having been injected by something and trying to determine who, why and what than turn into a fantasy involving people that were really not very interesting. I'll continue to be a Koontz fan because I typically find his stories to be very interesting and well written. By the Light of the Moon is, however, not going to be one of my favorites. I was so looking forward to the next Koontz book too!"
1,Desperately seeking plotline...,"Well, it has finally happened. Dean Koontz has actually strangled himself on metaphor, adjective, simile, etc etc etc. I paid full price for this turgid paperback and even with the leisure reading time of a cross-country flight, found myself skimming and flipping over pages to find the storyline. You can practically see him typing away, sighing with delight over every flowery, ornate turn of phrase that further obscures the plot. His lumbering try for humor reminds me of a simliar tragic attempt by Robert Ludlum some years back.I bought this book on the basis of some of Koontz's early works (Watchers, Twilight Eyes) and if this is what he is passing off as literature now, I'm finished.""By the Light of the Moon"" is not even worth a trip to the used bookstore - it went straight into the recycle."
3,Good but could be more,Dean Koontz's by the light of the moon fell short in my book. It had good suspense and action but just lacked overall depth and storyline. I will read more of his books for now i give this one a 3 out of 5 on the star scale. If you like Dean Koontz you might have a different opinion of this book.
2,Strange Change for Koontz...,"Although I was very taken w/characters and plot I was constantly distracted and pulled out of the story by this inexplicable change in Koontz's writing style- embarrassingly over descriptive, with use of entire paragraphs when a few words would have been much better. Awkward, inappropriately archaic or formal adjectives as if Koontz constantly referred to his Thesauraus. Hackneyed cliches and flowery outpourings slathered on everywhere- made what should have been an excellent read a painful one"
1,Major disappointment,"After having read app. 40 books written by Dean Koontz, I am getting more and more critical and apprehensive of his increasingly flowery style. Just 140 pages into By the Light of the Moon I found myself skipping pages and finally putting it aside with disgust. From now on, Koontz is taken from my buy-on-sight list and I'll never again buy one of his books that involves an intelligent canine or autistic brother, where the action takes place in just 24 hours (and thus begging for the disgusting extended prose and flowerly writing style) or is about a couple of people on the run for unknown persons and unknown reasons. Let alone, novels that include all of the above!!!"
2,Skip this one,"The is my first book by Dean Koontz, and I am not rushing to buy another. The plot read like a bad TV movie. The overall concept was interesting, but the way it was carried out was a little hard to swallow. The science should have been researched and explained more. Also, I'm not sure if I'm supposed to take the ending seriously or not. Koontz's depiction of an autistic character, however, was comical and poignant. (As a footnote, I was led to believe that this was a horror novel, but it is not. I am not letting that affect my review, though.)"
3,Familiar territory,"This one will be more enjoyable for new readers of Dean Koontz than longtime fans. While it's suspenseful from the very start, the story never seems to develop into more than a conglomeration of parts from other Koontz novels-one sensitive guy with one autistic brother, one spunky independent woman, dozens of those unstoppable government agents and an evil scientist.(Of Koontz's last four novels, only ""The Face"" has been truly memorable. Skip this one and get a copy of ""The Face."")"
2,By the Light of the Moon,I love Koontz! I have read all of his books but this one was just a huge disappointment. It dragged on and on and I was so glad to reach the end. This is not an example of the Koontz I remember.
3,Vacation?,"As a Koontz fan for several years, I eagerly await his new books. Although better than One Door Away From Heaven, in which I was very disappointed, By the Light of the Moon still does not have the same sharp horror and intrigue as many of his earlier books. Koontz has a great sense of humor, one that I appreciate. However, he has been over using it at times taking you out of the action of the book as you become too aware that you are reading a book, if that makes sense. Certainly not a bad read, and thankfully not as long as some other recent novels, I give this book 3 1/2, if Amazon would let me. Perhaps Koontz needs a vacation to rework his brilliant mind."
3,probably not his best but ok,"I hadn't read him before. Probably not his best book but you get a sense of his style. Parts of it seem written off the top of his head almost like a beat poet. The overall plot and characters didn't amount to much. The main ones were realistic but not that exciting. The bad guys were not realistic at all and the way they connected was like a cliche. Still there was enough to make it interesting. I'm sure I'll read another of his books again, and try and pick one with better reviews."
4,Very cool concept that needs a follow up book,"I agree that this is not Koontz's best story but it is a very good one. I love the themes of power, the past, and memories explored in this book. He has some great characters and the book is perfectly set up for a sequel. Please Mr. Koontz write us a sequel to continue the story!"
3,A decent read but nowhere close to the author's best,"This novel may suffer more by comparison to the other works by Koontz than it does on it's own merits. Having read most of Koontz's book this one seems routine and formulaic, as though the author were going through the motions and is somewhat impatient about getting the thing over with. While many of Koontz's book use a very similar formula they nevertheless succeed in maintaining the attention of the reader and creating sympathy with well drawn characters. One character in this novel is a female stand up comedian who drives around a plant that she talks to. She is never quite as endearing as the author intends. There are many tense and amusing moments as there always are in a Koontz novel but overall this is not one of his best."
1,Autisim,I thought that the book was on the boring side which is unusual for Koontz but I really thought that Koontz knows nothing about autism. He made the autistic character act like he knew nothing and had characters say stupid things about the autistic character. People that have autistic children do not even compare the autistic character to their children. I dont even understand why Koontz even made this character autistic.Dorothy Ham
1,"Annoying Characters, unrealistic plot","I am normally a fan of Dean Koontz, but not since his annoying character Christopher Snow, has Koontz come up with a more tiring cast of characters. Literally pages of text are devoted to monosyllabic exchanges between the hero and his autistic brother. Cute the first time, tiring thereafter. The plot of the entire novel is acceptable, but it never builds any depth and actually ends with the heroes discussing themselves as super-heros, capes, tights and all. This is so far from his best work that I almost believe it was written by a ghost writer with his name attached to attract sales. This is one where I would have to say to not just wait for the paperback, but wait for the paperback in the used bookstore."
3,Terrible ending,"This book started out really well, and I liked most of the characters. But the last 100 pages of this book are just absurd. granted, it is a science fiction suspense thriller, so a little bit of imagination is needed to make it work. But even the genre has expectations of somesort of realism, and this book falls short.I will however, applaud Koontz for doing a great job with Shep, the autistic character. I thought that he showed what families with autistic children go through in their care of an autistic family member.I do agree that by the end, Jilly gets real annoying. You could tell from her one-liners why she still worked second rate comedy club jobs.Not one of Koontz's best by any means. That honor still goes to Fear Nothing."
2,Not very good...,"I was really suprised by this book. I am a Koontz fan, but this was a complete let down. The dialogue between the characters was boring. It was very frustrating how the characters seemed to show little reaction to the things that were happening to them. ""Oh, my car blew up"" Koontz did a horrible job of making this book believeable. The only reason I am giving it two stars is because it passed the time"
1,No More Koontz for Me,"While searching for new books to read, I picked up about 5 books, 2 of which were from Koontz. I had never read anything from him but I was willing to give it a try since I had read an excerpt from 'Odd Thomas' and it seemed kind of good. I picked up 'By the Light of the Moon' and 'Tic Toc'. The former starts of pretty good and quite intriguing, but as the story unfolds it turns to crap. I'm not going to say what the book's about 'cause quite frankly, it's not memorable and so, I don't remember much.As for 'Tic Toc', it's far, far worse. Here's the premise: An alien hides in a doll and tries to hunt its master and manages to kill a whole bunch of people in the process, except of course, the master. It's a comedy. I admire the fact that he played with fire trying to mix horror and comedy but I'm sorry, Koontz got toast 'cause it's just not good. I should say though that the main character's mom rocks, but she's barely in it so..."
1,No more Dean Koontz for me,"I tolerated Odd Thomas, and I made it through that book. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for By the Light of the Moon.Someone gave this book to me for Christmas; otherwise I wouldn't have even picked it up. I attempted to read it, and was completely bored. Fact it - it's dull.There are a lot of Dean Koontz fans out there, but I am not one of them. I won't be making the mistake of reading another one.If I could have given this book 0 stars, I would have done that."
2,Diisappointing,"I liked Dylan, Jilly and Shep. I liked the early part of the story.As I got deeper into it the more disappointed I got.I'm not a fan of far fetched stories and for me, this story got entirely too far fetched.It's too long and too tedious and for me, too disappointing."
1,A total waste.,"I got a copy of this book a few years back as a Christmas gift, and the title and cover immediately put me off (and I'm really not the type that judges a book by it's cover). It wasn't until recently that I started reading this novel. Big mistake on my part. The novel began well enough, but then began a downward spiral. It had one of the oddest plots I've ever seen, and that alone normally wouldn't put me off a book. But in addition to the bizarre story line, it seemed as if Koontz had wrote the book, and then went back and looked up every word he had written in the thesaurus and replaced it with a synonym. Simple sentences were unneccesarily drawn out, and some of his figurative language (especially that which involved Middle Eastern conflict) was flat and boring. Truly one of the worst reads I've ever had the displeasure of enduring."
1,I'm Sad,"i dont really like opinionated reviews cause everyone has thier own tastes, until now.....this is just ""bad, taking advantage of the public"" writing,I would like the world to know how bad this book is. I wish i could shout it from the rooftops of every library and book store in the world, declaring how bad this guys writing is and how trite his characters conversations are. Ive only tried one other Koontz book (""the face"" i think its called) and although that was better, it was still filled to the brim with endless, focusless conversations that are extremely unrealistic. He is very longwinded in his descriptions, and that is in no way a good thing at all cause they seem to be long just to fill space. Honestly this book could have been 50% less, although i wish it was 100%"
4,Great book,This book is one of Dean Koontz's best. Great characters. Moving and interesting story with a very fast pace. Add in some humor to lighten it up a bit and you've got a fantastic book. A+!!
1,Very plainly..........,"In my humble opinion, it is the worst, or should I write least favorite book I've ever read. Shep this, and Shep that. The novel was extremely irritating to the point I just wanted to pull out the pages and sling it across the room. This is my second Koontz book I've read. The first was ""From the Corner of His Eye"", which was wonderful. It is on my list of top novels. This book, by my opinion, is garbage. Find out for yourself if you like it or not. I would strongly recommend getting and reading ""From the Corner of His Eye"" though."
1,a disappointment,"Koontz is one of my favorite authors, but this is a disappointment. I thought it would never end."
2,BORING!,"I was happy it was a library book and I didn't waste money on it. Went nowhere fast. I just couldn't get into it - too much superfluous discription that was really boring. After reading 95 pages, I just gave up. Don't get me wrong, I love Dean Koontz, and can't wait for the next book, but I was very disappointed with this one. Maybe he was trying something new, but it didn't work for me - wish he would write another Christopher Snow book. They were the best, but then, so was the Watchers and Lightning!"
5,A really fantastic book,"I really enjoyed this book, the mystery, the fast pace, and the endless action!! Great discriptive ability! amazing. I found this book very interesting and theatrical and magical"
2,"Shame on you, Mr. Koontz...","Wow! I can't quite describe my feelings after fighting to finish this book. I was so tempted to put it down many times throughout; yet, came back, hoping I would finally understand...NOPE! Just a lame attempt (from an otherwise great other) to fill some pages and make a buck. Shame on you, Mr. Koontz, for using the autistic Shep (who I really wanted to like as a character)to fill your pages by repeating the same phrases OVER and OVER and OVER...we get the picture! We saw Rain Man!!! Simply put, it just wasn't a novel I can rank as a favorite - the whole injection, nanorobot, theme could've went somewhere, but it just didn't happen in this one. Sorry guys, I hope I enjoy The Face and his newer ones more."
2,not that good,"I've read books from Dean Koontz before and always enjoyed them, but ""By the Light of the Moon"" was a disappointment. I couldn't even finish this book. The 2 main characters(Dylan and Jillian) were annoying, there was too much describing of things and the action took too long to unfold."
1,Boooring!!!!,"I decided to give up after 150 pages of this extremely boring book. If you are looking for fast moving suspense you're out of luck. Characters are engaged in pages upon pages of mindless conversation having nothing to do with the so-called ""suspense"" theme. On the other hand, if you have trouble sleeping this is better than any sleeping pill. Pure psycho-babble.Don't be fooled by the ""reviews"" on the first two pages and don't waste your money on this nonsense."
1,Very sad,"Being a Dean Koontz fan for over 20 years I was very sad to find that I couldn't even get half way though this book!! He has such a great gift for story telling and creating great characters and I liked the characters in this book. There was just too much fluff. The fact that it took Jilly over 5 pages to get her seatbelt on...I could have done it for her!! Very frustrating, very boring and very, very, sad because I doubt I'll ever look forward to reading a Koontz book again."
1,by the light of the moon,long...very long ..Koontz streches this book to the limit stupidwaste of time ..took everything I had to finish the book if I had not been bored at work would not have bothered.
3,"Pretty good, many errors, questions are too easy","I purchased this book because I found myself having to take the GMAT with only about two weeks to prepare. Reading the book gives you a false sense of confidence as the questions on the GMAT are much more difficult than the examples. In addition, there were many errors in the book with formulas and answers which makes it difficult to study if you are starting from square one.It is a good book to get your feet wet if you have not studied GMAT material in a while but follow it up with the Official GMAT guide. The book also had some good ideas (like the process of elimination method).Worth the cheap price, but don't expect much."
2,"Good tips, but too many errors!","This book is a good crash course with a lot of helpful tips and rules to remember, BUT when it comes to examples or practice test, author makes a lot of mistakes. What's more, author does not explain well why this answers better over others. And most of the time, when she tries to explain, she basically says ""it's right - just because it is right!"" Does it make sense? No? Well, get used to this kind of explanations because this is author's tactic."
4,Polaris Superwinch Mount,"The quality of the mount was very good. There were a lot of bolt holes...too many. The product had about 16 bolt holes, but were missing ones that lined up with the bolt holes that mounted the roller fairlead plate to the mounting plate. I would have liked to run bolts right through both plates to the winch, but compromised by using washers. It turned out great, and am pleased with how easy everything mounted together, but I wish they had drilled two more holes in the mounting bracket. It is a heavy, solid piece of metal that will hold up to anything."
4,Great Corn/milk free formula...,"... came just when I needed it. My son showed signs of dairy, corn, and potato intolerance. Our daughter had the same issues and we used Alimentum Ready-to-feed. It was just to expensive. This is a great alternative. Only drawback is he might get slightly backed up with it. I just added some pear juice."
5,excellent product,This product came on time. It is a very good product and my grandbaby loves it.I would always order it from this company. Excellent product!
4,Undetectable amounts of arsenic,Check out baby's only website. The dartmouth study was irresponsible at best. And then you have the henny pennys like justbooking. We are going to try the soy version. The dairy one caused horrific constipation when he was 4 weeks old. He is now 5 months. We just found out our ds has a milk and egg allergy. And the ingredients in prosobee which we are using make me cringe. Plus it's causing intermittent constipation.
3,Decent map,Best considered a road map for individual islands. Isn't as helpful for understanding relative positions of islands or an overview of the South Pacific.
5,no worries,"people who know great music will know that this is an incredible album...there are a lot of people that buy s>u>b p<o<p for the sake of buying it and some will recognize the sheer brilliance of this cd...i lucked into it while working at a little mom and pop cd store and getting the pre-release...damn, i love free cd's when they are good...jake starr"
2,What The???????????,"Wow....What a price jump anyone who would pay $400.00 for a very good condition cd is crazy unless your a millionaire, and have nothing else to do with your money.I will wait for the re-issue version thank you.Otherwise great album Visage is one of my favorite new wave groups from the 80's. Good Luck to the sellers"
3,Not worth the money,"Maybe I got a lemon... The light shows a crack-shaped shallow when shining on a flat surface. After some cleaning and inspection I didn't see any crack at all so I'm not sure where it comes from. I thought LED light usually gives off white color light but this one I got also has patches of yellow... On the plus side, it is pretty bright for a little guy. I would have kept it if it cost only $5 but it is definitely not worth $23!"
3,Almost Great,"It lights your way as advertized.It feels great in the hand and when both are busy, it fits between my front teeth just fine.I manage a country lodge and have been keeping my Impact in my left front pocket,hooked to the top, all the time so it's handy when a thing needs a fix in the shadows and, as it turns dark sooner, it's there as the night falls and my animals need to be tucked in or a guest needs a light.This is the Impact's WEAKNESS=the nice clasp, tab, hook thing has broken rather soon with no clear reason. I have asked Princeton if their warranty will cover the problem; but no response. So it goes."
1,Shame on Linksys,"Very disappointed with this product. The documentation is poor, making even the slightest config change requires a two minute reboot and their DNS feature is hosed. It acts as authoritative DNS for whatever domain it obtains from the ISP and then fails to resolve addresses for that domain. Example: router becomes router.ispname.com When trying to resolve mail.ispname.com the Router acts as authoritative DNS and does not relay that request so the request fails. I saw in the config where you can change the domain...but it doesn't work. This really hampers the usefulness of the DHCP feature, which again does not allow customization of DNS Servers. Add the poor VPN support, horrible docs and I've experienced occassional wireless outages that I never had with my 3 year old DLink and I have to say Linksys really blew it with this product. Is this what we can expect now that Cisco bought them?"
2,M ost features work,"The product was easy to set up and was in operation in our small office in under an hour. However, the VPN functionality is unusable. I spent countless hours on the phone with LINKSYS tech support and was never able to set up a user based VPN session either using PPT or the QuickLink software that comes with the router. The buzz on the internet is that a windows machine that has at some point or another run any type of VPN software will never be able to connect. I don't know if that is true, but I returned one of these already and plan to return the other as soon as I replace it with a competing product. So, if you don't plan to use the VPN functionality this is a great box. If you do, buy something else."
1,Useless VPN feature,"I already have 2 Linksys wireless routers and they work great (a no-brainer, like every electronic should be on its basic funtionality).With this unit I can't make it even FIND the device when trying to configure it for the VPN feature (which is the only reason I bought it for).I suggest Linksys to have JUST ONE of their engineers to post a troubleshooting guide (a serious one) for this product.I don't mind spending on a good product, but I also don't like spending a lot of money for a product that gives you the same as a cheaper one (happens all the time).I hope I find a VPN Router that satisfies my needs. This one goes to the trash!"
1,I hope this isn't a vision of what Linksys has in the future,"The WRV56G router & wireless features perform much like every other Linksys product that I have been happy with. However I purchased this item to setup a VPN and it has been nothing but problems. It was much easier to setup a VPN using Windows Server at my office then to do it with this ""simple"" router at home. Even using Linksys' QuickVPN is a waste of time since it is such a flaky and featureless program. Sometimes it connects sometimes it doesn't, no rhyme or reason. I will be returning this router. Linksys should pull this item from the market to prevent further damage to their otherwise good reputation. Come on Cisco (Linksys' parent company) you are the worlds leading manufacturer of networking how did you let this product out of QA? I am extremely disappointed."
1,Who designed this??,"Linksys has a well-deserved reputation for solid inexpensive equipment, but this router is a breathtakingly inept piece of junk. The person who tried to install it at my office was a certified IT hardware consultant with over 30 years' experience; after nine billable hours he conceded that he couldn't configure the VPN side, even with the help of Linksys technical support. Between his time, and pulling my office network down for a day, this misbegotten experiment cost me over $2,000. Don't go near it, IT DOESN'T WORK."
2,Good if you like to reboot,"I have had the wrv54g for about a month, and it worked fine until I needed to web into the router or use the wireless. The box locks out the ability to web in to the management interface, not the external interface (WAN) but the internal interface. And the wireless access dies at the same time.All the wired connections still function, as far as I can tell, and the firewall still functions while the management interface is locked-up. I have the latest code for the router, but I have had to reboot this thing almost once a day. This is a fairly pricey box for a home user, and Linksys has had some good products, but I would recommend staying away from the wrv54g.The reliability, or lack of, has really been disappointing. Save your money, this product is not worth half the current price."
2,Only barely does what you would expect,"I have a high opinion of Linksys products, but this is a huge dissapointment. I installed this on a customers site, and we have had only a few weeks of no trouble since November 2003. If you are looking for a good 802.11g wireless router, go with the WRT54G. Seriously, save yourself a lot of headaches and get the WRT54G. You have been warned. If you don't beleive me, look at all the firmware updates Linksys have had to put out since they launched this product. 2.10 was a disaster for the wireless side of things."
1,Stunningly Craptactular,"Unable to establish VPN connection with perfectly good IPSEC-compatible remote firewall. Have had to RMA TWO of these units. Linksys Phone support is clueless regarding VPNs or even the product configuration interface. Requires software syslog viewer to view router log. Linksys-provided syslog viewer crashes constantly making it impossible to view the router log. Settings not saved when router is turned off. Unable to use external DNS servers when using DHCP functionality, must use router for DNS (see electronics fan review). A real piece of crap from a company that normally makes reliable rock-solid products. Update as of 04.04.04: this review is with the most recent firmware (2.21 - 02/23/04) A Linksys rep informed me today that they are aware of issues with this unit and expect further firmware revisions to address them."
5,fantastic,"I recently purchased the LINKSYS WRV54G out of blind rage when the second Microsoft MN-500 Wireless Base Station I had, died on me much the same way as the first. I had heard nothing but good remarks about LINKSYS, although I was aware of an Internet connection drop-off with their other wireless products if the firmware wasn't upgraded from the factory default.Thus far I have not had a single problem with this router, despite the bad remarks. It is fast and I do not suffer from any connection drop-offs. I use port forwarding for a web, ftp, and ssh server and they all work flawlessly. I also use the DDNS function for hosting my personal web site and have no problems with that, either. However, I have not used the VPN function yet, so I cannot comment on its abilities."
1,BUYER BEWARE...CISCO JUNK,"This MAY be a good product for the occasional user. However, if your small business depends on this, you are dead. This baby will crash, crash, crash on you...even with the latest firmware. Nice idea to build a wireless router that supports VPN tunnels, but in reality, it just does not work. Look at the other reviews and think. Why does everybody say stay away? There must be something wrong if this many people complain. I live in Japan, and the Japanese retailers have already pulled it from the shelves due to the number of complaints. This is the SECOND time mine has locked up today. It WILL be replaced."
1,"Unreliable, slow and flaky","I purchased two of these routers - and have had nothing but problems.The second unit was dead on arrival. It's first replacement failed after 3 days. The third unit basically worked - except the VPN functionality. The routers couldn't hold a VPN tunnel for more than 4 minutes.Linksys technical support was unable to assist in resolving this matter and stopped responding to e-mail requests.The setup screens don't work properly with Netscape or Mozilla-based products, whcih makes admin using Linux painful."
1,"DO NOT BUY, Horrible product and Support","I have never been so disappointed in a networking product and I do this for a living. I ignored the reviews and give this product a chance. I waited on-hold for support on average 45 mins. Never again will I buy another Linksys product. I went back to my never failed 3com office connect product. VPN never worked, wireless was constantly plagued with disconnects, DHCP requested were slow, even after a firmware upgrade. Just a terrible product all around. I guess Cisco has brought to Linksys it's terrible Quality and lack of testing."
1,Poor excuse for a router,"The first one I bought dropped connections to all my PCs at random times. The only way to reconnect was to reboot the router. After I replaced it, I discovered the new one would not allow PCs on the network to ping each other. I called Linksys, made it finally to 2nd tier support, and they said it must have been damaged on the boat in shipping. I asked them if they wanted the serial number to identify a ""bad batch"" and they said it was a manufacturing problem, not tech support. Ridiculous. Don't buy it. I did not try the VPN hosting functionality."
1,Not a Boingo HotSpot Router,I only bought this because it was advertised as the preferred router for setting up a Boingo HotSpot in a Box.Boingo no longer offers that system to new providers so don't waste your money!There are many other wireless routers that do a better job for a lower price. I am returning mine to Amazon. They shouldn't advertise it for a service that is no longer provided.
3,A lot of extremes from Linksys,"We have been using this router for 1-1/2 years now and the hardware is flawless.The setup requires someone with and IT background.We could not upgrade the firmware above version 2.38.6 or the Quickvpn software would not function.As for the Quickvpn software, Linksys needs to support it better.The windows ""hosts"" file needs to be updated and security firewall settings must be set correctly.Once done, the system works well."
1,"Unreliable, Constant Rebooting Total Nightmare","I've always had good luck with Linksys, however the Wireless WRV54G is one product to stay away from.This is the second one, the first one I returned because it could not maintain a wireless connectivity for more than 1-2 hours. I'm using 3 laptops one with a Cisco 350 card, an Orinoco Gold card and a Proxim A/B card...all these cards work fine with other access points and wireless routers but not with the WRV54G. I am 100% sure it's the WRV54G router.The first one was shipped with 2.01 firmware the second one had 2.21 on it...nevertheless it had no improvements in the wireless connectivity area. The wireless is completely down after a day or so. A reboot is the only resolution.I haven't even tried the other features yet, what the hell, the basic functions aren't even reliable enough to function properly why bother trying the bells and whistles.Bottom line, don't waste your time...very disappointing!!!"
1,"Listen to the reviews, spare yourself the nightmare.","This product does not work. If you are buying this product for the VPN then find something else. It flat doesn't work. Linksys support just wants to push you away, because they know it doesn't work. If you have doubts, go to www.thegreenbow.com and read the faq's about their vpn client software. There is an faq about how their people were never able to establish a tunnel with the wrv54g router. The only advice Linksys had for me was to put my server in the dmz. If I wanted to open my computer up to the whole world I wouldn't need their stupid router. Save yourself the headache, and pass on this one. Trust the reviews you read. I wish I had. Mine's being picked up by fedex today, after wasting two weeks trying to get this piece of you-know-what working."
1,WRV54G Not Ready for PrimeTime,"This unit is the worst Linksys product that I have ever encountered. The ISP assigned IP does not renew except when rebooted (must do once a day). The VPN quit working after a week. Linksys' support is even worse. They say ""yeah we know but we can't do squat right now"". So I say why the hell did you release that to the public. Haven't you heard of testing.... what a concept. I guess that's what happens when you get too big."
1,Please don't buy this product - High priced Junk,"I bought this router from Frys store(not Amazon) hoping that it would be better than the Belkin router that I already have. Alas! What an utter disappointment.Pros: Can't really think of any. I'm going to return it anyway, and hoping to get the refund asap :)Cons:1) This router needs constant human supervision to power restart every now and then. Did Cisco/Linksys even bother to do an internal QA on this product?2) Routing functionality doesn't seem to be good either. Just average.To top it all, they advertise on the cover to run your own wifi-spot with this junk ;) Yea right!"
1,Has to be one of the worst products on the market!,"This router has to be one of the worst made products on the market, and has the poor customer service. This router was defective out of the box, took 3 weeks of communication with Linksys's customer service before I finally just returned it and build my own router with the same functions."
1,Wireless VPN Router,Could not use this product. Parts missing and the seller send it in a broken box. Do not buy anything from the seller. Buyer be aware.
1,Poor VPN Support,"I upgrade a customer to this device to add the wireless capability. The were using a Linksys BEFVP41 successfully with SSH Sentinel VPN Client software. I am unable to connect with SSH Sentinel and am told by Linksys support that it does not support the SSH Sentinel software, yet, to keep checking their web site for update firmware.This is aweful that they replace a product and remove functionality."
5,"Excellent Fantasy, New Authors","This is a great book, several excellent fantasy stories. I particularly love Reunion by Lucinda Siverling. I almost felt as if I were Khedrine as she loved and lost her love and fought to save a village from a viscious beast!"
5,The Wraith's Forest,"Judith Leger wrote a terrific story. It holds your attention from the first word to the last word. You feel drawn in to the characters, you can feel for them and the conflicts they are going through."
3,Torn Between 3,"When singers come & go these days, it always seems to be a misunderstanding. That absolutely came with Genesis during their era. At first, it was the departure of Peter Gabriel, then the surprising of Phil Collins and his announcement of leaving Genesis, and it seemed like it came and went a third time with Genesis. After the entry of Ray Wilson as the lead, Genesis really seemed to be lost. Their only song as a hit with Ray Wilson, Congo, from their lackluster 1997 record Calling All Stations is a very upbeat and dark song. Although Ray did have song growth to go through, it just didn't seem to be altogether. The song is pretty nice, but not for die hard Genesis fans. Still, it does sound more enjoyable than Britney Spears anyday."
3,a good start,"The single ""Congo"" definitely is a different Genesis, but worth trying. The two extra tracks are of b-side quality, but worth it to collectors."
3,very cute but not much padding,"I bought this for the baby I am expecting in a couple weeks and it arrived today, it's even cuter in person, I love the fabric but I was very surprised at how rough it was, it's not soft at all. The mattress also isn't very thick, the blanket that comes with it feels more like a changing pad than something I'd wrap the baby in. I'll just be using my own blankets to pad the basket and make it softer before I put her in it."
3,Disappointing,"The reviews for this book, and its sequels, were so outstanding that perhaps my expectations were too high. The reviews that the books were 'meticulously researched' and full of period detail might make you think that there is a strong historical component to these books, but in fact these are really period novels, rather than historical fiction. The history that is there is fine- it's just that there isn't very much of it. As for the fiction part, it certainly reads well enough, keeps you moving forward, and (as another reviewer points out) is not full of predictable happy endings. In fact, it is not at all cheery- there are very few characters that you particularly like, and all of them come to a sad or bad end. The concept is tremendous, and the execution is fine, but not as amazing as the other reviews would suggest."
3,an ok flick!,"ahhh,this movie is ok, the plot does kinda suck but oh well it has pamela in it! and what more can you ask for pamela will definitely keep your attenion!! and they show some very nice steamy scenes! as well. but if you want more of pamela and a little my exposure of her, check out raw justice you won't be dissapointed!!!..."
1,what is this world coming to????????????,"saying that a film is worse than Barb Wire is VERY scary, but this is. I don't get why this was made. Pamela Anderson does pornos for just as much money, but since society doesn't deem themj as ""films"" I don't have to watch them(being the movie buff that i am)"
2,i *wanted* to love it,"suffice to say, i read this book last year (I was 29 and hoping it held all the answers), but I had to look it up to remember it.I do remember being entertained by it, but it's not some great, life changing novel.It was a decent, quick, light read, if a little fluffy and/or girly.Good for a day on the beach (or waiting for the subway), I guess, but nothing life changing."
1,barely worth finishing,"sorry, but boring characters and boring story. which would be ok if the prose was good or the insight acute. neither is true."
5,The Big 3-0,"Mike Gayle is big in the UK, but for some reason he hasn't caught on to the same extent over here. I don't quite know why, because Gayle can write some blissfully (and sometimes wistfully) funny stuff. Plus his characters are endearing, sympathetic and human -- even if sometimes they act rude, egotistical or boorish. Turning Thirty is just as humourous and absorbing as Gayle's previous work, which means it's operating at a pretty high standard indeed."
5,turning thirty reviewed by minxemoo book review,"OMG................This book is soooooo brilliant.It was as though I had stole my brothers diary and was reading it.Mike is an amazing Author. I am defiantly going to read more of his books.The characters he uses are like so many people I know.This is a must read for any male or female of any age.I don't want to write anything about the story line as I don't want to spoil it, all I can say is, ""If you need a good read this will not disappoint you.Thank the lord for Authors like Mike!MINXEMOO'S BOOK REVIEW.......................10/10"
1,"MAGLITE 108-612 NVG Lens with Holder, Green (C or D Cell) MAGLITE","I Can't rate this because it was ordered accidentally, I was merely viewing it and evidently hit ""One Click Ordering"" by accident, so I returned it unopened. I had to give it a star rating in order to print a review. (The One Star Rating has nothing to do with the products quality.)"
4,Kind of a throwback......,"....to the days when they were ""pickin' up the pieces."" The songs are shorter and the melodies brighter; no major epics like ""Crazy Eyes"" or ""You've Got Your Reasons."" That's not a slam, though. ""Keep On Tryin'"" is a sweet harmony song with just an acoustic guitbox for back-up. ""Makin' Love"" could've been a real hot single for the band back in '75 if MCA had gotten behind it; as it is, it's a great Poco rocker, similar to ""A Good Feelin' To Know."" ""Sittin' On A Fence"" has a wonderful West Indies feel to it with, once again, those harmonies! This album is one of the best Poco did and serves to remind those who listen that ""country-rock"" (or whatever) isn't the bland, Californy granola it's detractors keep painting it as. Head over heels indeed!"
4,Eclectic Poco,"Though a tad uneven at times, this album is probably one of the better examples of how versatile Poco could be. The acoustic ""Keep on Tryin"" features Poco's harmonic sound at its best and was one of the best songs bassist Tim Schmit contributed during his time in the band. ""Makin Love"" and ""Georgia, Bind My Ties"" highlight the band's ability to rock and their cover of the obscure Steely Dan song ""Dallas"" and ""Lovin' Arms"" pay homage to the band's country-rock roots. This album has some really great moments, but also a couple of weaker spots. All together it stands up as a very nice collection of music, even if it isn't up to the level of some of the other releases by the band during this period."
1,a stero-type baathist,"very well expected, the son of his father. read more about Adnan Janabi, under Saddam Oil Bribes."
4,This book inspired me to blog!,"I'm not sure where the original copy I bought went to, but I realized I had lost it and had to order a new one. Salaam Pax and I would probably not agree on everything, but he's a passionate writer and this book offers a perspective on the lead up and early days of the Iraq war that no American audience was privy to. The blog was great, but the book is timeless."
5,"Perfect, but I didn't measure...","This is exactly the model I wanted, but was too small for my dog. My fault, should have measured my dog's neck. This brand is out of stock and I've had a very hard time trying to find retailers who have any left. I sincerely hope Coastal starts making more, soon!"
2,not what i expected,"I expected the item shown, instead I got the regular looking ones, that instead of having 3 things sticking out on the sides, it had 5. It also had about 3 scratches that looked like it could have been glued together. I bought this for about $9 and it was the same as one I could've bought for $5, and used.I would've returned it, but i was desperate. The picture of the blender part looks more durable than the other cheaper-priced ones, but it's not.not too happy."
2,Not as pictured,"Like the Oster blender caps sold by everyone else, these are no longer the heavy duty ones pictured. They are now much thinner and cheesier. They work, but don't last long in my experience."
1,Bad purchase,"While the picture and the description were a perfect match for the replacement part I needed, it turned out to be a horribly cheap plastic piece of junk. It didn't last two weeks."
3,Yep - That's the one,I cracked my other bottom cap. Was worried I wouldn't find the right fit - but this one worked perfect!
1,so bad it's almost good,"This is probably the worst music ever. It's somewhat enjoyable how bad it is. It's just so unbelievably bad that it keeps hitting you every few seconds and you can't help but enjoy the pure awfulness it. This music fails in every way. It is completely synthesized, there are no real drums, no real horns, no real guitar and no real piano. Maybe Domingo's ""big band"" was out to lunch and he was running out of studio time. This music fails in every way."
4,Give it a whirl,"I saw this movie late one night on HBO and decided to give it a whirl...but it gave ME a whirl! I enjoyed it far more than I expected! Tobey McGuire is sooo adorable as the young boy who's just enjoying life while drinking a few beers. The suspense, the scandal, the sexual tension, and the part where the bullies get their a**** beat all combine with much more to make a truly enjoyable film for our generation!"
2,4.5 STARS? REALLY???,"I GUESS IF YOU ARE A FILM STUDENT/FAN OF ADAM WEST/HOT FOR TOBEY MAGUIRE/AMY HATHAWAY/HAVE SEEN EVERY OTHER MOVIE OUT THERE/ETC/ETC/ETC...THEN JUST MAYBE YOU COULD GIVE THIS MOVIE ANY MORE THAN 3 STARS. I DON'T THINK THE MOVIE WAS BAD - THERE WAS 20 MIN OR SO OF MILDLY ENTERTAINING CLIPS ALTOGETHER - BUT THE WAY SOME OF YOU (REVIEWERS) MAKE SOME OF THESE MEDIOCRE FILMS SEEM LIKE THIS ""INTERESTING JOURNEY THROUGH THE EARLY CAREER OR SO AND SO, BLAH BLAH BLAH"". . . PLEASE. HAVE SOME BALLS AND TRY TO BE A BIT MORE HONEST. SOME OF US ACTUALLY LIKE TO READ THE REVIEWS AND IT SEEMS LIKE SOME OF YOU ARE AFRAID TO BE HONEST ABOUT A FILM BEING BOOOOORING - OR MAYBE YOU COULD AT LEAST GIVE A HINT ABOUT HOW THE MOVIE IS SLOW OR HOW INCONSISTENT THE ACTING IS. YOU WOULD THINK SOME OF YOU WORKED ON THESE FILMS THAT YOU'RE REVIEWING, AS IF BEING CRITICAL ABOUT ENTERTAINMENT IS EVIL."
2,Wish I could have the last hour and a half of my life back,"I had thought this was going to be the well-regarded Steve Zahn/Paul Walker JOYRIDE film. Alas, I decided to watch when I saw Tobey McGuire was going to be in this version.Yeesh.There is a lot of bad acting in this film. ""Smith"" is a joke. An over-the-top mess. McGuire begins as likable but loses all credibility after a discovery in the trunk of a stolen car. The ""gay"" character was really the only character whose actions made much sense from that point in the story forward.I kept watching for some payoff. The only payoff that came was that this bizarre dud is over, and I now have the chance to spare someone from making the same mistake I did.Skip it. You'd be better off watching weeds grow in your backyard or something."
4,Let's go for a ride.,"A kid working in his Dad's motel decides to take one of the guests car for a drive with his friends. The problem is, there is a dead body in the trunk and the kids soon find out that the woman that owns the car is a proefessional killer. Enjoyable."
3,Over Bright!,Great content but it is a shame that the recording is so overly bright and tinny that it makes it very hard to enjoy the music. I remember the originals when they were first released and was hoping to re-capture some of the flavour of that time.
2,Hard to screw up a tank top,I am a medium... I have been a medium for about 20 years. This medium fits me as if it wree a large or even an extra large. I also wish that the tag was non-existent (as other moisture wicking t-shirts have evolved towards). Good price... Yet you might want to keep looking.
5,Awesome,these are awesome....i can't stand wearing cotton to the gym and it's difficult to find non-cotton tank tops in the stores in my area. These fit really well and are very comfortable. i definitly recommend them.
3,An extra star because of Mark,"If it wasn't for Mark Dacasco's finely chisled physique and screen presence I would have given this movie a 2 star rating. The story is extremely chliched and offers nothing to capture your attention beyond the limited action. A low budget movie, although it does well with what it has. I'm trying to find more positive to say about it, but it all comes back to seeing Mark be ripped and ripping apart the alien."
5,great,"I purchased this dvd to replace my vhs, it is a great movie, worth watching over and over, a must buy."
3,Slightly Above Average,"I bought this movie very cheap and figured that it would be your run-of-the-mill, low budget, terrible B movie. It was not. This movie has suprisingly well-done special effects (for 1997). The script is very typical and the acting is OK. This movie borrows quite a bit from ""Predator"" as the waterfall scene at the end and the ""Creature"" resembles those of predator. Overall, this movie is worth a look.SCORE 80/100 B-OVERALL:PLOT: 15/20 CCAST: 15/20 CSPECIAL EFFECTS 17/20 BDIRECTION 16/20 B-FUN: 17/20 BCONTENT:VIOLENCE: 7SEX: 1LANGUAGE: 4"
1,It could have been better,"I found this movie very poor. The story was nothing unusual and also the action wasn't too great. The special effects were outdated, even for 1997 and the acting was nothing that the actors should be proud of. I'm sure that the producers could have done a better job since many movies which are much older than this one have better special effects and better action (Aliens 1,2 and 3, terminator,...)This is one of the worst movies i've seen (and i've seen MANY movies) and i don't recommend it."
3,Decent Resource,"While this book has some information that is very useful, the organization of information makes it difficult to pull resources or information quickly. Rather than being able to open up to multiple sections in order to find 1 or 2 pieces of information, I found that I was having to read entire chapters. Even then, the information glossed the surface and did not provide me with thorough enough ideas that I could apply. Still, for a general reference that you can use to pull 1 or 2 paragraphs from for parents, this is a useful resource."
4,A POP ROCK CONFECTION WITH A BITING EDGE TO IT,Songs are introspective and moody about life and relationships yet melodious with Beatle-esque harmonies and a rocking beat. Includes a wondrous Pink Floydian aural soundscape bonus track at the end of track 5. Musicianship is solid and the singing is first rate. Great debut record for a promising band with a lot of potential.
2,A TRIBUTE TO THE DOORS,"I picked this up for a couple bucks in a bargain bin somewhere as the titles that One Way choose to reissue are usually of some worth, even if only for the crackpot value. The lead singer sounds like Jim Morrison (anyone remember Orion?) and the sound is not disimilar to the Doors. Klaatu anyone? Absolutely no liner notes. Next."
5,Elegantly awesome book!,"""Dreamhunter"", wow it sounds so mysterious. Elizabeth Knox has really outdone herself. She wrote a 365 page book (hardcover), and made it sound like a fairytale written in perfect english.Laura Hame's father, Tziga Hame, is a famous dreamhunter. He takes dreams from a magical place called the ""Place"" and performs them to people to either entertain them, or heal them. There are very few dreamhunters, each with their own special talents. However, not all is as it seems. Laura must learn the truth about her father when he disappears, and what she learns could change the course of the future.Through magic, fiction, and politics, Elizabeth Knox writes an elegant fantasy that keeps READERS ENTERTAINED! READ IT!"
4,Fantastic novel,I had a feeling I was going to love this book when it was suggested for my book club. I'm a big fantasy and YA junkie so this seemed like the perfect fit for me. This is unlike any book I've ever read before. I was drawn into Laura's world of the dreamhunters. This takes place in the early twentieth century and has a steampunk feel; an alternate history since the dreamhunters entered the world. I enjoyed the struggle Laura felt as she has to grow up once she realizes she is also a dreamhunter like her father. Her cousin is not and she has to do things on her own in order to find out why her father disappeared and what The Place actually is.The relationship between Laura and her cousin is beautiful. Even though Rose couldn't go with Laura into The Place she was still there for Laura. Their relationship is one I wish I could have with my own sisters.It's a unique and interesting story; I loved it!
1,Take a pass on this one.,"I bought this book on the strength of fantastic reviews and was sorely disappointed. Although the story was interesting enough to have gotten a 3 stars from me, I am giving it a 1 star because I feel that putting unnecessary sexual innuendos (however slight) in a book for young readers is inappropriate. I would not mind if these comments added to the story, but they were all completely superfluous. I am glad I read this first before giving it to my 12 year old daughter,but I am upset that I wasted my money on a book that I can't have my daughter read. This is too dark a tale for young readers, but is too simple a tale for adults."
3,Don't know what it was...,"Maybe it was because I developed an indifference after the first few chapters, but I couldn't get into this book at all. I didn't care enough for any of the characters, and many times the prose just fell flat for me. I found it difficult to sympathize with Laura Hame, and although Tziga was quite interesting at times, unexpected inconsistencies in his behavior turned me off.That said, the underlying plot is rather intriguing, and quite original. I'll give it some leeway and three stars, since it might possibly have been me and not the book."
2,I just couldn't get into this one,"Dreamhunter was recommended to me, but I found myself disappointed. I couldn't get invested in any of the characters and felt that the plot dragged on. I moved on to the next book before finishing, I just got to a point where I didn't want to pick it up anymore."
2,Can't get into it at all...,"I'm very surprised to see so many positive reviews on this book because I've only just hit chapter 4 and I'm ready to return it to the library. I can not get into this book at all. I'm finding it very hard to follow and the writing style has no flow. Its a very slow, choppy read so far and I've grown bored."
5,Amazing book,So easy to understand and nicely written. Very useful examples clarified with pictures.It really takes you deep inside the world of Feng Shui.
4,my favorite F.S. book so far,"I have read 5 or 6 feng shui books so far and this is probably my favorite. It does not go deeply into numerology, directions, etc, but it is more of a general read. It is very readable and not too dry. About halfway through the book it starts having chapters on each room, with tips and suggestions room by room."
5,Natalie Reviews Feng Shui Your Life By Jayme Barrett,"The Doorway to a new way of being youI am new to Feng Shui I bought Jayme's book Feng Shui your life. What I found, in the book, far exceeded my expectations as a new comer to Feng Shui. Jayme has found a way, in her book, to demonstrate the mindset of Feng Shui. She brings it to life and makes it easy for you to bring Feng Shui into your life. It's as if she is reaching out from the book to touch you. The book is very attractively put together, it is done with style and grace in the Feng Shui methodology. I recommend this book to beginner or veteran, it has an energy of it's own that reaches out and touches you. Every page unfolds to reveal a world that has been waiting for you.Natalie - A Feng Shui're for Life thanks to Jayme and her wonderful book. Spreading Pink Light to all."
2,Feng Shui your life,"I bought this book because it has a 5 star rating. However this book does not even include the basic knowledge about Feng Shui. The author talks about how to make your life happier, how to help people around you. She also mentioned about painting your front door with red color is always good for everyone. It is not true. I found this book is misleading Feng Shui beginners."
4,Great Reference,I have been using this book to help paint and decorate our new home. The layout of the material in the book makes it easy to use. I would highly recommend this book to folks who want to create balance in their homes.
2,Disappointing,"The photos are beautiful and the author offers nice tips on improving your life through things like relaxation and letting go of the past, but if you're buying this book to help with home design you'll be disappointed. This is more a lifestyle book and I didn't find the principles of Feng Shui practically explained. I also found much of it superstitious nonsense - this book would have you hang crystals in doorways, hallways and 'a wind chime over your head while you stand at the stove to call in prosperity energy' (P219). On the other hand, maybe I should stop being so harsh, because knowing my two boys implementing many of these ideas would certainly introduce a lot of laughter into the house...."
3,"Practical tips, but didnt really work.","This book is written fine. I made some changes in my home. It felt somewhat better, but not really much change. I think it may be an old system that perhaps we have moved beyond or works better with ancient religions. Nice book, good details. But not much change."
3,Feng Shui difficult,I purchased two feng shui books and this is the hardest of the two to use. It is not as interesting as the other and is a little more difficult to put to use.
1,Buyer Beware,"We bought this RAM after first checking the simpletech website to be sure it was compatible with our E-Machines. Since it said it was compatible we ordered it. Well, it didn't work in the E-Machine even after speaking with E-Machines tech support. They said ""It just isn't going to work.""I would recommend buyers be absolutely sure the RAM works in their machine by checking with the manufacture of the computer before purchasing.After arguing with the vendor, Antonline, about returning it we had to stop payment on the credit card to get the matter resolved."
5,Incredibly Useful!,"I found this little book an incredible resource. I always get the Lasser tax guide when I file, but with all the changes in the tax laws I also wanted a simple, short, easy to understand explanation of everything and this is it--It tells you the new law, explains it in language you can understand, then gives examples of how it is applied, with tips on using it. I am not an accountant, and have always dreaded the thought of wading through tax books to find extra deductions but this was easy to do, and maybe because it was written by the same people, but I found this and the Lasser Your Income Tax complemented each other well--it made for easy reference back and forth."
2,Poorly bound books,"I bought 10 of these books and they all fell apart within 1 month of gentle use. POS. The content is ok, but the quality is absent entirely."
5,i love this book,"i am learning spanish as an adult. i have seen a lot of spanish books that are marginally useful. this one is packed with grammar and is presented in a useful and interesting way. it is too advanced for a complete beginner, but once you have mastered the basics this book will take you to the next few levels.i highly recommend it."
4,Great for bright beginners!,"This is not an introductory book, but it can be used if you have really bright students. It breaks down the language into usuable parts. If you find it too advanced, just go at a slower pace, and spend more time on each exercise."
4,Almost the Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice,"Although this book is 'cheap and cheerful' and covers all the grammatical issues that intermediate students of Spanish need to absorb it falls down in it's presentation: no photos, no color, no illustrations hardly. Also I do not like the answer key at the back of the book as I cannot assign exercises for homework.I use this book over 3 semesters: 2 of intermediate Spanish and one advanced Spanish grammar and because of it's cost I will continue to use it."
2,Watch the computer requirements,"The book looks just fine, but be sure to notice that the CD is MS Windows-only. Oops."
1,The Ultimate Spanish Review,"I have never received this book. I emailed Amazon & Hungrybookworm last week but have not received a response. This item was charged to my credit card on April 14, 2009.Please advise me of what I should do....Sharon Schaap"
3,Important Review and Information,"This book has the exact same content as another book that I own called Repaso. However this book is in a smaller size format and does not have the space for the exercises. I would recommend purchasing Repaso and the answer key unless you need a smaller format for reference only. In addition, Repaso has some reference material that is omitted from this book."
5,Great grammar book,This is one book that no Spanish student should be without. It's a great book to have for learning grammar or even to keep as a reference.
5,Good Practice,Great practice and instruction. The excercises are most helpful-iqual que la tarea en la escuela español en Nicaragua.
4,Great review,Excellent resource to review or learn Spanish grammar. Lots of examples and lessons to practice on. Best part is the answers are in the back.
5,Bought this for my mom....,"...who was studying for her Praxis exam. Not only did it help her pass, it came within 48 hours! This is a great book!"
5,Superb review material,"I'm using ""The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice"" as an overall brush-up, having recently completed the Pimsleur courses, the two ""Spanish Now!"" books and Dorothy Devney Richmond's two ""Practice Makes Perfect"" books. This book is doing an excellent job of tying everything together, particularly with its extensive exercises. Like any good review book, each chapter builds on the ones before it as opposed to introducing a topic, reviewing it, and dropping it for good. And several of the exercises will give your brain a good workout.I'd quicky recommend this book for someone with a solid basic grasp of the language -- perhaps a second-year student. It may prove to be too advanced for early students of the language, as some concepts (such as commands) appear in exercises several chapters before they're actually reviewed.All-in-all, an excellent resource"
3,"Good collection, disappointing sound quality","This collection has some great cuts I haven't heard before, but about every other track sounds like it was taken directly from old 78's (noisy, hissy, pops), and the others sound good. The shame of it is that a friend of mine has an LP collection from the '60's, 'The Best of the Ink Spots', alas, out of print, with many of the same cuts having much superior fidelity. I'm hoping that collection gets reissued."
2,disappointing sound quality. stick with your old vinyl,"all the great songs are here,but most tracks are so full of background ""scratch & pop"" you'll think you're listening to old 78s!"
4,"Long awaited, overall very good","I wrote the liner notes, and selected the tracks. Track choices weren't totally mine, but wanted to put on some rarities new to CD. Sources could have been better- many taken from 78 to CEDAR, again not my choice. Project took over a year. Photos were mainly from me also."
3,Great songs........awful sound.......,"I waited a long time for an Ink Spots ""Anthology"".....was this one worth the wait? hmmmmmmmmmmm.......I was happy to see the song selection....overall....it was pretty good......but like others who have reviewed this CD.....the sound is awful....some songs the hiss and crackle is louder than the music....there are much better compilations out there!"
3,Excellent compilation but sound quality is poor,"This long-awaited anthology of the Ink Spots is thorough -- with several notable omissions -- and comes with excellent liner notes. It presents a very good overview of the career of this group, which had 46 chart hits between 1939 and 1951. There were a couple of puzzling omissions -- ""Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall,"" a 1944 #1 in which the Ink Spots collaborated with Ella Fitzgerald, is left out, as are several other excellent chart hits, such as ""Someday I'll Meet You Again"" and ""You Can't See the Sun When You're Crying."" Most disappointing, however, is the sound quality. There is evident groove noise on many tracks; in some cases it is so bad that the track is almost unlistenable. With current technology, it seems much more could have been done to improve the sound."
5,A very funny movie,"This movie was a very good movie, I can not belive anyone would give it a bad review, but then again some people in this world must not have a since of humor, I belive that evey time you have Feldman and Haim paired together you are in for a very entertaning movie, and this movies proves that to be true, I would tell eveyone reading this that you to should watch this movie!"
1,Horrible Movie,THis was a absolutely stinky movie...Made no sense..had no plot...don't waste your time on this movie.
2,"Very, very bad.","This is one of the worst National Lampoon movies ever, other than Golf Punks. I bought the Canadian video version for $5.99 at Nobody Beats The Wiz, and I still felt ripped off. Don't pay so much for this movie. That said, this really isn't all that bad. There are some funny moments, like the talking rock that says ""Read the National Lampoon."" But the bad editing and confusing script is what gives this movie 2 stars."
1,"I love you Coreys, but this movie is terrible","Wow, what can I say about this movie?! Cheesy, awful, ridiculous, awful, terrible, awful. But I still love you Corey Feldman and Corey Haim!!"
1,Perfect Title for a HORRIBLE Movie!,"Corey Haim probably will go down in history as the Worst actor who ever had potential..His performance in 'Lucas' was amazing..and his later roles like this one are amazangly bad! This film has no plot whatsoever and I think they are making up all the lines as they go along. Last Resort may truly be the worst film ever made..I'll probably eventually own it, as I collect these kinds of films. Oh, not to leave out Corey Feldman (the second worst actor with potential)...he was absolutly revolting as well."
5,Voices of Mexico,"""Not only has it [The Shadow of Ulysses] found the strands of the dilemma that must be woven into a coherent whole. Not only does it propose alternatives for creating and strengthening communication that go beyond the barriers of language and combat 'the isolation and narrow-mindedness that has congealed down through the years'. Most of all, it inspires or should inspire researchers, academics and intellectuals from both sides to abandon their ivory towers and understand that it will be possible to build bridges only when 'we recognize that the river is both the Rio Grande and the Rio Bravo'.""--Voices of Mexico"
3,Was great... for a while,"I thought this product was wonderful, until it stopped working! It is the most comfortable earpiece I've tried yet, and seemed to pick up my voice sufficiently. However, after just a couple of months, something broke inside it, and although I could hear my callers, no one could hear me! Some broken/loose connection? Who knows?I am tempted to buy it again, and hope for the best. No other earpiece was as cool as this one *was*."
2,"Fits like a glove, I hear everybody, nobody hears me","Sigh... I bought this product after having read the first review on this page. I WAS a happy customer. The earpiece was comfortable like no other, I could hear all of my calls, crystal clear. I loved it. But to my dismay, all of the people I called complained that it was very difficult to hear me. I would call from my car or in a room and all complained of a ""windy and static"" noise. A noise so loud that most of them didn't want to continue that conversation. 'nuff said?Too bad I'll be returning this one. None of the other pieces have been this comfortable."
1,Better than Ericsson hands-free (updated),"I wrote a review before, It WAS great. how things change the ear piece fell apart and now the headset is useless. I adjusted the rating downward. Beware.*****ORIGINAL REVIEW FOLLOWS******This model is far superior to the Ericsson hand-free model. I used the Ericsson hands-free and I was always straining to hear. With the Body Glove model I have no problem hearing or others hearing me.Also the Ericsson model has nothing to hold the earpiece you must shove it down your ear canal. Not good hygiene.Must have especially now as it is illegal to drive with a cellular phone in hand in NY"
5,Can't say enought about Moleskines.,"Sturdy construction. Easy to remove a section of pages if you decide you want to dedicate the journal to another purpose. And the wonderful, sturdy pocket in the back. I buy lots of these things."
3,Not As Good as expected,Maybe its the passing of time or just not as complete as some of the other bands of the day. The music just does not seem the to have the continuity from one tracl to the next.
2,Absolutely Useless Except for Video,"Unless you buy it only for the video, don't expect anything new here. The title track is exactly the same as on ""Calling All Stations"" (not a radio edit or anything) and the b-side (though the word isn't really appropriate anymore), ""Second Home By The Sea,"" is simply an edit from the eponymous album (""Genesis"" a.k.a. Mama or Shapes). The CD-ROM part is a little more interesting, but isn't worth the price: it features the Congo music video and video comments by the new band."
2,dance(do what you want to do),as a painter this is the song which portrays the essence ofmy life. read henry millers 'the wisdom of the heart' after 20 years i got a CDcopy of 'sunburn' and i listen to this tunereligiously. why hasn't anyone else caught up? -rene' (LA)
5,Great forgotten funk gem!,I read some reviews about this band and took the plunge blindly without listening to their music and I was not disappointed. Great funk band that deserves way more attention than they've gotten. Many highlights on this release but the one jam I typically turn up in my car is Radiation Level.
4,Come flick my bic...,"In '76, I danced to ""Wanna make love (come flick my bic)"" as a 17-year-old. Twenty-five years later (2001), I got lucky and scored a copy. Sun was a good band with a tight sound. Get a copy at a good price and check them out for yourself! Four stars!"
4,Missing their best tune!,"Dance (Do what ya wanna do) is their silkiest, smoothest song. It would be popular today if it got the air it deserved. Does anyone know where I can find it?"
5,hot as hell,"this version of hot rod lincoln cant be beat,buy it and play it 2000 timesthen go try and buy you a hot rod lincoln <amen>"
1,Waste Of Money,Save your money. Go to WalMart and buy a $3 flashlight. It will produce just as much light. The beam is very weak and full of blind spots. This light is not worth what it is being sold for. I returned mine and requested a refund.
2,Dorcy Failsafe rechargeable flashlight - Beware,"This is an ill-conceived product. Years ago I had a rechargeable light where the actual flashlight was kept in a cradle that attached to the wall and was easy to enter back into the cradle for recharging. I tried hard to find a similar light when I bought this one but couldn't. This Dorcy light has the plugin prongs mounted on the light itself and are swiveling which makes it very difficult the hit the wall receptacle without folding the prongs back into the unit. So you have to dig them back out of the little recessed area they fold into and try again. It's aggravating to say the least.BUT, the worst thing about this light is that is has a very WIMPY beam of light. It's pretty useless outside, barely illuminating an object 50 feet from you. It's only a little better than no light at all.I consider that I wasted money on this light. Do yourself a favor and get something else."
3,"okay movie, but not one of Michael Dudikoff's better movies.","Michael Dudikoff's acting was alot less 'stiff' than his earlier movies; showed more humor, but the character ""BB"" could have been played by someone better."
5,Until the Final Hour - Hitlers Secretary,"Being a WW2 History Buff, it was a book well worth waiting for to read. The last days of Hitler as told by his secretary is both fasinating and gives the reader an inside look at the insane Hitler in those last days. Recommend this book to all."
4,fascinating,"The author was not a genius in any way, but she did live in the thick of a defining moment in history, and her story is fascinating. As is usually the case with villains, Hitler was more complicated than people like to think."
1,Limp!,"I read the other reviews and was very excited. We are big fans of ""The Jazz Fly"" and jazz in general. This was very disappointing."
4,A classic,"Richard Reti shows the evolution of chess by analyzing games from great players from the past. In doing so, he also provides the reader with basic ideas on how to handle the opening, approach the development of pieces and confidently enter the middlegame. The contrast between the hypermoderns and classicists is also of interest and, in my opinion, a landmark in chess is represented by this book.The biographical notes are also interesting from the chess culture point of view. I love this book and consider worth having it in my personal library. Why 4 stars instead of 5? Because of the descriptive notation..."
2,The ninth wave,"Just couldn't get into it. Certainly not the type of book I'd expect from theauthor of ""Fail Safe"" which I thought was very good. Sorry."
3,Cute,"Grin and Bear It! is a short joke book featuring bears. All the jokes in this book are in the same format. There is a question and there is an answer. The jokes are simple and more often than not, a play on words. An example would be ""Q: What Kind of hat did the French teddy bear wear? A: A bear-et (beret)."" Most of the jokes are obvious enough that younger readers should be able to understand them but not all of them are going to be understood. Children who don't know who Abraham Lincoln are obviously won't get the joke. The jokes presented here though are ones that are similar to jokes that children tell each other all the time. None of them are negative about people or bears. They are positive, fun filled simple to tell jokes."
2,Bad quality discs and casing,"Discs played ok but the pictures on the disc were completely smudged, also all of the plastic protective rings were smashed."
1,couldn't deliver,"DVD's release date on Netflix is unknown.The original films produced by the filmmaking industry are theater version.The file size is huge.To create a (smaller file-size) version for DVD, all the compression parameters have to be individually tuned.Existing films were entirely created by incompetent humans.According to ghost, competent people couldn't even tune the compression parameters at all.Every clean shooting scene was added various layers to as sound effects and visual effects.All the compression parameters have to be individually tuned for every episode and every release version.Competent people couldn't do that at all. Not even for documentaries."
4,Undercover,"This episode was really good! I enjoyed it alot. It had a lot of twists and turns like most of the episodes do but, it was still interesting yet suspenseful! I definitely recommend this episode to others!!"
5,Review of Law & Order Special Victims Unit,"When the item arrived, I was so excited that it had come so fast. Unfortunately, one of the discs had fallen out by the thing that holds it in. Otherwise, the item was in pretty good condition."
2,SVU 9th,"SVU is interested but even some of the best episodes are easy to see through. The story tellers are fairly interesting creatively, but there are so many gaps in the story. It is now on Netflix streaming, so I would not have bought it if I had known."
2,"Not that great, but well written.","This book was bought for a family member of mine, so I read it before hand, and I was not impressed. Hope is great, but false hope for someone dealing with trama, is not. This book cannot answer the questions as to why a person in mentally sick and so forth. It instills a false sense of relating to the world. Im a therapist, so my opinion should account for something."
5,Powerful book,This is one of the most beautiful books I have ever read. A friend passed this onto me and I remember reading the first 20 pages on a bus and not being able to stop crying. It was so beautiful and it made me look at myself and others differently. The one thing that we are all searching for is Love. That is the fundamental purpose of life. Absolutely amazing book in it's simplicity and beauty.
5,"Deeply contemplative, not an easy read but worth it","I actually bought this book because I thought it would help me open up to *romantic* love, as in, to meeting my potential partner/soul mate/twin flame. It was none of that, but it did help me open up to Love -- the greater love for life, for people, and especially for myself and God.This book was not an easy read, but it was worth it. While reading, little light bulbs went on in my mind as several realizations became clear and obvious. I've read a great deal of spiritual material before, and had become almost against the word 'God' because it connotes a judgmental creature looking down upon us. This book does not go into ""defining"" God, but refers to the term a lot. As a result, I was able to return to being okay with the word and really feel what Gerald May was talking about.It was really worth the money, and it's one of those books that you read 2 years later and realize how much deeper is becomes the next time around."
5,Loved it,Gerald May is a very good author. He will bring a tear to your eyes. He has since passed away. What a terrible loss.
4,Definitely worth the bargain basement price,"This is early Dave Mason, so no track will be found from ""Let It Flow"", what I consider his best album. But this CD itself is a treat, and definitely worth the price."
3,"""TASTY"" but less ""TOASTY""","Neil Merryweather/WORD OF MOUTH - a fine collection of tunes to fill your home entertainment center! Although less interesting than the ""SPACE RANGERS"" and ""KRYTONITE"" recordings, this selection has some memorable highlights."
4,"Interesting, Thought-Provoking Collection of Essays","This is a slim book (approximately 124 pages) that contains essays by different writers who each examine a major factor that contributed to the South losing the Civil War. Although in hindsight it appears that the South was doomed to lose, in reality, it was a close contest that literally could have been won by either side. Although the North had significant material advantages, the authors point out internal factors and decisions made (or not made) by the South that contributed greatly to it's eventual defeat. This book, although originally published nearly 50 years ago, remains surprisingly relevant and thought-provoking today.As an interesting aside, the forward to the book was written by retired Major General U. S. Grant III, the grandson of Union General (and later President) U. S. Grant."
3,Review,"The book is good for anyone who wants a quick understanding of certain possibilities of why the North won. However, some of the essays(this is no reflection of the actual book) are not that well justified in my opinion."
2,good but,The speed in which the item came was very good. The content of the DVD was very good. But the quality of the recording was poor in some places to the point where we could not watch it.
5,Superb Presentation - IT HAS CHANGED OUR CHURCH!!!,"Our Sunday school teacher purchased this DVD and has been showing it in our class for the last four weeks. The results have been nothing short of astounding. We have been energized with a desire to evangelize like never before, taking confidence in knowing that God is sovereign and He has guaranteed our success. I have purchased a copy for myself, as well as my father in law (who is a Baptist minister.) This video is never boring and is chalked full of great commentary, vignettes, and interviews (not to mention the music is a great blessing. I find myself humming Amazing Grace throughout the day!) I beg you, no, I implore you get a copy of this for those friends and family who are Arminians (even if they do not know that word) and for your church library. You have everything to gain..."
4,Cisco delivers!!,"The third in the series of The Cisco Kid Collections is another winner. These are the best prints of this series I've ever seen. While they are not crystal clear, they are certainly better than the worn syndicated prints which turn up on local TV stations. Very enjoyable and highly recommended to all vintage TV westerns fans.Volume 4 is rumored to be slated for February, 2005 release. I certainly hope so."
2,Too fragile! During installation mistaken slipped off from my hand to wood floor & it broke in half!,"My electrician tried to install and one speaker slipped off from his hand & was dropped on the wood floor, but the speaker broke in half. It is just too fragile."
4,Good Deal Ceiling Speaker,"Many people said that ""sound just OK"". I agree! However, you should know how much money you have spent on this Ceiling Speaker. What I can say that it is great sound for this ceiling speaker price.Of course, you can spend double or triple price to get little bit better sound quanlity."
4,Great sound and bang for the buck,"Sound quality is not equal to an overpriced one but is good for home users. If you want theater quality then chances are you are not looking at this. But for those that want a good quality speaker for a good price this is it.Also the quality of the sound is related to the speaker wire (use at least 14ga or thicker), install, and your power source. Set all those up correct and this will work great.I did a 7 speaker setup with the Pyle speakers here from Amazon and they sound great. I used 12ga wire, installed them to direct the sound correctly, and used a good amp/receiver to power them with.I used the 6.5's for the rear and the 8's for the front as I have larger room. If you have a smaller room then just use the 6.5's and skip the eights."
5,great value for the price,This is the second set of ceiling speakers I have installed in the past 2 weeks. The first (NXG) lasted 1 day before 1 of them failed. These have survived the holidays and lots of loud music and still sound great!
3,Fair,"They are fair for the money. I rec. one speaker that was damaged and fixed it myself. Since I have these in garage, no big deal."
2,this cd also have dvd,hello I want to know if that CD includes dvd where this video devuelveme la vida davis bustamante thanks
3,Poor Quality,I have had this item for about 30 months and the out side has bubbies from the road salt. They will probably need to be replaced with in the next year. For the price I would have to rate them as poor at best for anyone who lives in an area where road salt is used. They are fair weather lights only.
5,Coach: Lessons on the Game of Life,"I bought this book for my husband. It was so very impressed with the story he finished it in a day. He really enjoys Michael Lewis' style of writing and has read several of his books. I would recommend it as a Christmas stuffer for any coaches, parents or baseball fans."
4,Short Inspirational Read,"I believe this was a nice, short read. I wasn't expecting miracles from this tiny book but I do believe it was a nice, heart-warming story with some good life ""reminders"" in it."
2,Coach,"Michael Lewis has captured the lessons that many of us learned a long time ago with the old style of Coach. The kind of Coach who cared a great deal about his players but never showed it . Todays youth and their Parents cant take the 'Coaches' style anymore because it doesnt cater to their self esteem and constantly being told everything they do is ok even if it isn't! Old coaches demonstrated tough love all the time and you lived with it or you moved on! Basically you learned to grow up! Richard Farnham, former Director of Athletics at the University of Vermont 1973-2003"
5,Every Parent need to read this.,"GREAT!!! This book focuses on not just about playing a sport. But, alot about real life. Every coach should have his parents and kids read this book."
1,Blog Post - Not a Book,"Bought the Kindle version for $8.99. ""Coach"" is the length of a large blog post and while well-crafted, should have been sold as a packaged magazine article, not a book. Don't buy it."
2,Should've Been Marketed As An Essay,"This one got way too much attention from NPR. I loved the interview there with the author, but, quite frankly, his entire story was told in that very sitting. This ""book"" is really an ""essay"" that doesn't deserve all the paper it's printed on; I would've been much more appreciative of this author's sentiments had it been marketed more appropriately."
3,Good ideas - A little short and undeveloped,"I liked Mike Lewis' basic premise in the book, but I just thought the book was awfully short. It was more like a magazine article than a book. It was only 100 (very small) pages and a bunch of those pages were photographs. But I did agree with the basic sentiment of the importance of ""battling one's way through all the easy excuses life offered for giving up"" and that now we bestow self-esteem on children at birth rather than have them earn it through accomplishments attained with hard work and sacrifice. I hope that parents everywhere take an hour and read this short book."
3,Could have been so much more,"Moneyball was a genius book in my opinion - an examination of baseball statistics that challenges the historical significance of sacred stats such as RBI and batting average. However, it appears that Mr. Lewis was banking on the success of that book when he hurriedly put together this short memoir of a high school baseball coach that seemingly impacted his life in great ways. Mr. Lewis manages to package that nice story up in barley 70 pages.The thought was nice, however, it very much lacked any kind of character development and real substance. Just as we get to meet his ""Coach"" the book is almost over.This is a nice little read that you could get through in an hour or less, however, if you have a hearty appetite and want to sink your teeth into a meaty book, this is not for you. Skip it and read Tuesday's With Morrie."
3,Not sure this was the best medium...,"I'm a little confused by this book.It's the third one I've read by Mr. Lewis (and I've seen movie adaptations of two others), but even considering the subject matter and what it meant to him, it just doesn't have the usual 'oomph'.This book is about his beloved high school coach, 'Fitz', but it's more a truncated polemic about misplaced societal values, how 'entitlement' has taken us away from those values, and about parenting that's not quite rooted correctly and clearly not executed in the best way imaginable.While well-intentioned, I believe that what the author set out to do could have been better accomplished either in a long-form essay...or a book using 'Fitz' as the touchstone and go-to reference throughout, but incorporating much more from modern American life that illustrates what he's maintaining.As a final stab, I really don't think that the message was relayed as poetically as it deserved."
2,"What's Here is Good, There's Just Too Little of It","One does wonder why Mr. Lewis allowed a great article to be transformed into a razor thin volume, augmented with a few pictures. Hopefully his superb article on the California recall election in 2003 won't be packaged as a hardcover in the near future. Then again, pictures of Arnold Schwarzenegger will surely move many copies.The profile of Coach Fitz feels rather incomplete, relying almost solely on the author's own memory and its conflict with the current win-at-all-costs mentality of today's parents. If there is a real story to be had here it is the increasing social acceptability of parents as hyper-advocates for their children in school, sports, and pretty much any artistic or creative endeavor. That is a subject that deserves book-length treatment (and not just a hardcover pamphlet, either).Assuming that readers of ""Moneyball"" haven't yet done so, they would do well to pick up ""Liar's Poker"" instead of this book."
2,"An Essay, Not A Book","As has been noted, this ""book"" is basically a New York Times Magazine article. Though the story of a coach now having to deal with spoiled players is interesting, don't bother with this one if you are looking for a long read. The claimed 93 pages is for a 7"" by 5"" book that's double spaced and includes 25 pages of pictures leaving 68 pages of text.The story was interesting, but ended without any real conclusion or resolution. I enjoyed Moneyball, but in the end thought Coach should have been a web posting rather than a book."
5,A wonderful book!,"While the parents of the children being coached by Fitz want something else, I hope my kids have a coach like Fitz as they grow up. I know from personal experience how as a kid I often hated my coaches. Now that I am an adult, I look back on the important lessons they taught me, and the abilities I learned from them. I feel sorry for the kids that are coddled by their parents. They do them more harm than good."
3,Don't Buy This (But Not For The Obvious Reason),"How in the world could I give ""Coach"" a three star rating but suggest, ""don't buy it?""It's a fun, quick read with a few nuggets -- definitely worth a read.But... you can finish it in 20 minutes. Of the 93 pages, at least 12 are photos. (I've read longer newspaper columns.)I suggest you go to Borders or Barnes and Noble and buy a medium coffee. Before your coffee gets cold, you'll be done with this book.Then if you really like Lewis' writing, purchase, ""Moneyball."" It's a tremendous look at the business side of baseball."
1,Just the NYT Magazine Piece,"This book is just a word-for-word repackaging of Lewis' NYT Magazine piece. It is a wonderful story with important themes, but I wanted more than a hardcover version of a magazine article.Michael, please tell us how Coach Fitz is doing today!"
1,Don't bother,Save your money. This book(?)is a random collection of thoughts and recollections of a youth that no longer exists. Someone should have told the author that sometimes the world changes and not always for the better.
4,Don't be afraid...give Proust a try!,"This is Volume 2 in Proust's In Search of Lost Time series.In this volume, the narrator gets close to and then loses his first love, travels to Balbec, makes new friends, and starts to fall in love again. That's all that happens.But again, as in Swann's Way, Proust tells the reader every detail in beautiful prose - what the ocean looked like, why she acted that way, what the narrator is thinking, etc, etc.I found the first third of the book to be a little tiresome, since I was sick of the behavior of certain characters. But once we got a change of scene in the narrators travels to Balbec, I started to really enjoy Proust again.I have to say this once again - if anyone is curious yet intimidated by Proust (as I was), just try the first hundred pages of Swann's Way. You might be surprised."
2,Nice idea but instructions not helpful.,"We played this for about half an hour, then we were bored and quit. The instructions are too brief, and do not explain well enough how you play. The game provides ""factories"" and ""chunks"" in only one color each, so how do you know who bought a property? And what is the rent? It doesn't say. How do you use the Satisfaction cards? The instructions don't say. How do you buy a mortgage and why would you want to? It doesn't say. How do you buy chocolate chunks and why would you? It doesn't say. Once you have four chunks on a property, you can buy a factory, but how do you get four chunks on a property? It doesn't say. Finally, we quit. This game is very pretty but without decent instructions, we can't play it. It's going to Goodwill."
5,"""It's our pick to make you sick!""","This album was actually released in 1967, but the original RCA copies are pretty hard-to-find (my Dad's had his copy ever since it first came out), so the 1972 reissue on Pickwick/Camden with a drawing of a bearded George is more common and easier to find. The absolute classic is obviously ""Wonderful WINO"". George also appeared on ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" many times around this time, and he did some of the routines found on this album.I have the promo-label copy of the single of this--can you imagine that this was actually played on the radio atthe time? Then again, I can't imagine George putting out a routine out as a single now, but it would be very amusing to see his new single: ""Farting in Public""."
1,horrible,"Why did i waste my time reading this book? The author didn't even put any effort into the story. Definitely lame and poor choice. Lower than a one star, please."
5,great retelling!,"I came across her books at my library. This is the second goddess book I have read. I have always loved fairy tales and beauty and the beast. This was an awesome way to redo it. The way she writes, it sucks you in, and can't stop reading it."
5,Really liked the end,"Could a woman really love a beast? Great retelling of beauty n the beast. I have always loved the beast, and felt empathy for him. This story spun his history and had my heart wrenching for him. Bravo for that alone :) ! I found myself skipping over a lot of rose descriptions. I get that it's the realm of the roses, and her name is a rose. And there's this garden, and that garden all with lots of roses. But honestly, I spent so much time reading about roses, I don't care to ever hear or read of them again. I think the flower was a little over done. Loved the love story though, wish there was more of it."
4,Great,Love pc cast and this is a great read. Curl up and indulge with this great novel with glass of wine.
5,Romantic,"Every time I read another of P.C cast goddesses books I always say to myself, ""This is my favorite Goddess book."" Of course Im claiming this to be my favorite Goddess book. It was beauty and the beast all over again but with great sex scenes and lessons to be learned....you cant help but fall in love with the Gaurdian."
1,Boring,This has got to be one of most boring books I have ever read. Or I should say half read. I can't believe with all of really great reads out there that someone would find this book good. I am going to dump this one on the book shelves at my gym. Maybe for free it makes a better read. However I doubt that.
1,"I can't rate the item because I never received my book from the jerks as ZP Books, NEVER ORDER FROM THEM!!!","I contacted ZP books several time to see where my order was since it was late. I did not receive any answer back from those jerks!!! I ended up getting a refund from Amazon, but I would have much rather had my book. I will never order off of Amazon.com again!"
1,Is it good or just hear say?,"The tremendous success of hear say in the UK can mean only one thing. Long term PAIN for my ear drums. But before all you Americans start laughin this band has a lot of sorry $$$ backing them and world wide domination is on the cards. With any look they will last less time than the Spice Girls did on their brief but unforgetable reign of terror. Callin the album ""Popstars"" is arrogant, I'd have called it ""Popstars?"" or ""Flopstars"" or even ""Who the F*** do ya think your kiddin"".The album is the usual assorted junk that you get with all manufactured bands, desperatly switching genres in a vain attempt to find one their good at. Before I become over critical I must admit that there first single Pure and Simple is not the worst song (it's second to Spice world). The rest of album is on the same level so if for som inane reason you liked it this album should be right up your demented little street"
1,not again,"another manufactured pop band, another pop band for that matter and just more and more [stuff], repetitive and annoying music. This era of pop music has got to end and more bands like hear 'say, westlife etc are just giving music a bad name. DO NOT BUY THIS PLEASE."
4,Popstars UK. A Manufactured band that can sing!,"This album is incredible, even more so by the fact it was compiled in 4 months, rather than what can be years. Hear'say have taken the British charts by storm, and are bound to do the same round the rest of the world. There first hit, Pure and Simple is a catchy tune that u don't mind singing in the streets. This is by far the best POPSTARS album released anywhere in the world (I have listened to most of them!!!) Just remember... Wherever you go, I wanna be there. Whatever you do, I know I'm gonna be there, It's pure and simple I'll be there for you"
1,Should be called BEEN'SAID...,"Bootleg All Saints or what? The single ""Pure and Simple"" is so ""All Sainteque"" I had to do a double take when I first heard it. As for the other songs, does the word mediocrity mean anything to anyone????? I'm sorry but I watched this atrocious phenomenon of Popstars take place in the UK and though I hoped something good would come out of it all I have admit my disappointment gene went into acute overdrive. It suffered major cardiac arrest I might add when their single ""Pure and Simple"" hit the UK charts and proceeded to end up in the Number One position, well there is no accounting for British taste, which is peculiar to say the least. Maybe I am being too harsh but even the Spice Girls who were as manufactured as they came had a distinct sound of their own. This group should have been called ""BEEN'SAID"" because it has, and that makes is all the more cringeworthy...."
4,caliente,"So my boss hooked me up with this album (points up^) by Plastilina Mosh- a group I've never heard of before. They're great hot summer cruising music. I think they are what would happen if the Beastie Boys and the Gorillaz had a Latin baby that had Smashmouth for a nanny. My favorite song is Track 05, ""Monster Truck"". Give a listen if you want something new. Its almost like a mix tape rather than a cohesive album... a nice palate cleanser if you will."
5,In Los Angeles they can't believe they are mexicans!,"They are complex -from ""complexity"" the latest theory on thinking which in a few words means: using different systems creating a new system - a complex system -(for more info read something from Baudrillard- or other authors). They are so good and there's so much prejudice against Mexico here in LA thatT people just refuses to believe they are mexicans. so fellows open up that mind! Plastilina MOsh It's good for you."
3,"Good, but Molotov even better","I really like the Plastilina Mosh album - especially tracks like ""Nino Bomba"" and ""Afroman"". However, the rest of the album leaves something to be desired. If you're looking for really funky Latin hip-hop, check out Molotov's first record ""Donde Jugaran Las Ninas""."
4,Bring on the mosh!,"Sometimes I'm grateful for fate. Without it, I never would have picked this rad album off the shelves. Now before listening to this I had no clue there was such a thing as ""Spanish lounge/hip hop"". These guys sure know how to start a party, I love their slide guitar on ""Monster Truck"". And people at the parties I Dj dig ""Nino Bomba"". It doesn't bother me that half the songs I can't understand cuz there in Spanish (I think). Now I wish I didn't drop my Spanish class in High School."
3,Decent for practice,"Surprisingly good for a few dollars. None of these will really grip you and make you have to dance. But they will help educate you about the range of music included in paso doble. All tracks are played by the Manuelo Montez Orchestra. These are not ""strict tempo."" They range in tempo from 55 -64 beats per measure. (This is still available in the boxed set: ""Strictly Dancing."")Here is the title, duration, and tempo:1. Sobre Verde, El 3:22 (55 bpm)2. Beso, El 3:15 (56 bpm)3. Te Quiero Y, Olé 3:14 (57 bpm)4. A La Reja Andaluza 3:41 (57 bpm)5. Nardos, Los 2:26 (57 bpm)6. En ""Er"" Mundo 4:13 (57 bpm)7. Gito 2:55 (59 bpm)8. Soldadito Español 2:46 (59 bpm)9. Paso Al Fandanguillo 2:35 (61 bpm)10. Gato Montes, El 2:36 (63 bpm)11. Cordoba 2:06 (63 bpm)12. Islas Canarias 2:16 (64 bpm)"
1,why waste your time,I am thinking a worded review would be wasting more time on a book that was terrible. That is all
4,very good for a first novel,"I have read a lot of new authors works, this is one of the better ones I have seen. It has action, adventure, and a touch of romance. While not perfect, it hads an excellent story-line, with weel developed charaters. the action moves fast enough to keep the reader interested and is not overly bogged down with technical details. I found the book refreshing and not full of useless dribble."
3,It's this authors FIRST book and it's pretty good,"I felt this book was a pretty good book for a ""First"" time book writer. It was a good story. All writers seem to get better with each book they write and I think this writer is off to a good start. I myself am looking forward to future books by this author and I wish him much success.By the way, this book is not written at a childs level so most children under 16 probably would not understand it or get much out of it. So if you are thinking of buying this book I would suggest you buy it for a 16 year old or older person.This book is for someone who enjoys all kinds of sci-fi."
1,Earthforce,"This is one of the few books that I couldn't finish. It was long and drawn out. If you like boring over worded books, this one is for you. I noticed the author is making a trilogy, I think he should have just taken out some of the stuff in this book and added what he wanted for the other books and made one."
4,Very good rock`n roll album from Victory,"This is a Great album from Victory, relised in 1989 with Fernando De Luca on vocals, their new singer. He has a great voice that fits this band just great. Pure glam Rock like it was back in the 80`s. With great guitar riffs, synth and harmonic clear sound. The album is full of energy, powerfull and good produced. Great songs on this record is: More and more, power strikes the earth, on the loose, so they run, standing on the edge of the time, but the hole album is great. Easy listening, straight 80`s rock`n roll."
5,Song List - Killer Hard Rock,Track Listing:1. More and More2. Never Satisfied3. Don't Tell No Lies4. Always The Same5. Power Strikes The Earth6. Lost In The Night7. On The Loose8. Let It Rock On9. So They Run10. Standing On The Edge Of Time11. The Warning12. Into The Darkness
4,"German Rockers,'80's style","This CD is full of GREAT late '80's rock...not a bad song on this recording. Saw them at The Basement in Dallas,small crowd,mostly girls. These guys RIPPED it live. Top-notch musicians,awesome vocalist. If you liked the hair band days, this CD will surprise and thrill you. Get a copy any way you can! VICTORY!"
1,looking for metal band victory- cultured killed the native,"looking for metal band victory- cultured killed the native is it the same band .there is no reviews or list of song . hunting for the cd .is it the same cd.heared couple tracks love the cd. please inform me if this is the same cd. some of the songs should be- always the same, on the loose.want to buy but dont know if same."
5,"Advanced Financial Accounting, 8th EditionAdvanced Financial Accounting, 8th Edition",I bought this book for school. The delivery was awesome. The price was great. I would recommend any college student to check out this site for cheap textbooks.
1,THIS IS NOT THE TEXT BOOK,I bought this item thinking it was the actual book but it is actually just a study guide which is meant to be used with the book. Buyers beware of what you are purchasing! THIS IS NOT THE TEXT BOOK.
4,Sterling adaptation of EM Forster's novel,"In what must surely be a great milestone in the history of homosexuality and mainstream cinema, Maurice (James Wilby) is a young man coming to terms with being gay in Edwardian society. The rest of the excellent cast includes Hugh Grant, Rupert Graves, Denholm Elliot and Ben Kingsley.Beautifully shot, with exactly the production values we have come to expect of a Merchant-Ivory production, Maurice is an engaging film that touches on themes of sexuality, class and religion frankly, convincingly and with much poignancy. The central romance is handled movingly.DVD extras are pretty good: About half an hour of unused footage with an admittedly rather sparse commentary by director James Ivory; and a fairly interesting documentary featuring interviews with cast and crew."
5,Maurice is real!,"I have never been so moved by a film about love. Maurice may have been set before the war but the story and truthfulness of it is happening today. Once in one's lifetime you see a film act out your life...Maurice acted out mine. Choices in life oftentimes require sacrifice and oftentimes painful decisions. This in one movie worth seeing, not for its gayness, but for its reality. And made me mighty proud that like Maurice, I chose what will make me happy, and I am!"
5,"True, uninhibited love that conquers","A really good movie taking place in in a society that shows love, even between men, is often struggled for. The acting is really good as are the wonderful sets and scenes. There is some male nudity, which often occurs in the older films, strangely enough. This helps the story though as it takes you on this mans journey from a love that was very limited and hidden to a totally uninhibited love that conquers all barriers. Loved the movie and can watch it over and over. Highly recommended"
3,Hugh Grant is not suave he just has a good agent,"It always interesting to hear british actors being described as classy and proper even though England has the most bloody, dirty, inbred (Royal family), horrific, degrading, barbaric, inhumane history since there has been written history. Hugh is no exception, he's slimy, a good con man. He does play gay rather well which makes you wonder. No wonder the world thinks Americans are stupid."
5,Good Movie,This movie is interesting in that it depicts a theme in the edwardian period. The exploration of this particular theme in that time period is educational.
5,Maurice from the Merchant Ivory collection,"I first read Maurice years and years ago, as someone struggling to come to terms with my sexuality. It's a beautiful tender tale of young love. Two men destined for two different paths told brilliantly with amazing actors giving life to their characters. One man finds true love in the arms of antoher man. The other finds his own way. Any viewer, gay or not, would come to understand the time period and the consequences of being a homosexual then. It's a must see in my opionion not only for the subject matter but also for the rich backdrops of old England, English countrysides and more. It's a stunning film."
5,A true classic.,This is a most beautiful movie. I can`t imagine anyone not enjoying it. The two disc package is brilliant and I will be heirlooming mine to stay in the family long after I have gone.
5,Finally on dvd!!!,"Some of the best films by the creative team of Merchant/Ivory were adapted from works of E. M. Foster. This beautifully filmed movie is a story about a young man who struggles with his sexual orientation and his status in society. James Wilby plays the title character honestly and with dignity as he searches for love, falling for a good friend ,Clive, (played by a young Hugh Grant) and eventually following his heart and falling for a young man of a lower class. ""Maurice"" and ""A Room With a View"" are great companion films and well worth an addition to your personal library. As a bonus, this new version of the film offers a second disc with extra features, but the real gift is that this film has finally been released on dvd. A classic film with a classic theme---the search for love and acceptance. I highly recommend this movie!!!!"
5,In the grand tradition of filmmaking,"Lush, with score, cinematography, acting, costumes that are all top drawer. Two young men meet while attending college and fall in love. At first, it is all very platonic but soon things change..A very realistic account of gay life in turn of the century England with all its laberynthine hypocrisy. Hugh Grant gives and excellent portrayal of someone who would rather not buck the system, despite the cost. James Wilby as Maurice is radiant, beautiful and quixotic in a very 1920's way. Rupert Graves, as his street-savvy gamekeper-lover draws Wilby out of his sexual hell. All is done with a degree of realism which is extraordinarily romantic. A great ensemble cast. Watch it with your finger on the rewind button. You won't want to miss anything!"
4,Brilliant,"The scene opens on Maurice, at a young age, with a rather eccentric, yet wise, teacher on the beach. The teacher, in an attempt to be operate in place of a Father, stresses that important ""sacred"" love between and man and woman. The movie pushes forward to years later- where Maurice is learning to identify with a growing passion for his room mate, which he find is reciprocated in beautifully dramatic manner. The movie then twists from hidden love to classes of men where one must face the fall of what he has become for the love he feels. The movies are long- but make no mistake- the time fly's by as you become enveloped in a tale of love between the two most unlikely people. I highly recommend this movie."
5,Lushly beautiful and based on Forster's personal experience,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Everything about MAURICE is beautiful. This film resonates as a fictionalized depiction of an unhappy early relationship in E.M. Forster's own life in which his love was set aside by another man for empty social acceptability. Maurice's relationship with Alec is a healing one. Some of the best scenes take place when they are maneuvering around the people in their lives to find themselves, ultimately, together and in love. They seemed to speak a secret language to each other, without speaking. This movie opened my eyes in many ways and changed my life. It is one of a kind and brilliant."
3,"Bronson Shows Off His New ""Ready To Kill"" Fashion Line","And so endeth the greatest series in the history of revenge flicks, this being the only DW since #1 to take a half-hearted stab at ""Artistic Quality of Production"". Which makes it far less enjoyable than ""DW3"" and ""DW4:TC"", though I really dig the homages to the Three Stooges' ""Sing a Song of Six Pants""."
1,What the heck was this?!!!!!!!!,"I have seen many Bronson movies like Chino, The Great Escape, and The Magnificent Seven, and The Death Wish Series. Death Wish 5 was the WORST movie that I have seen that starred Bronson in a minor or major role. Nothing in this movie was believable, especially the acting. The death scenes and gun shots were extremely exaggerated. If this movie was a comedy, I would have given it a 5."
2,The last Death Wish,Sticks to the same plot style of the previous 4 with Bronson going out for revenge. The only problem I have with this one is Bronson looks far too old to be chasing bad guys and it all seems a little silly. In Death Wish 4 he still looked the part.
1,Haven't been able to view it,"This DVD is a good movie BUT I have not been able to watch it BECAUSE I have ordered it 2 times,and both times it only comes with French and Spanish Subtitles to me. I want it with English subtitles.They refuned back my money when I wanted the DVD in English. The big Question is ,IS it made with english Subtitles?Willie Reese Miller"
3,Kersey's final bow,"There's not a lot to say about this, the fifth and final ""Death Wish"". It's not too out of the ordinary for the series except that it's quite obviously very low budget, resulting in an odd fading-out visual quality. Story-wise it's what we expect and Bronson is his usual grand old self. It's difficult to be too harsh on this one because it would be the last time we'd see the character and the last time Charles Bronson would appear in a theatrical feature. All he would do for the remainder of his life would be TV films.The last scene is very memorable and a few kills are unique. This is good entertainment, nothing more or less than that."
2,Parody on itself.,"How sad that a great series should come to such a pathetic end. Why Charlie agreed to do this one is a mystery. But if they had to make it, couldn't they at least have made it ""business as usual""(Bloody & action-packed)?. -It's so tame; the preview-audience must have been grannies, telling them to go back and change a few things(""wouldn't an exploding soccer-ball be fun ?"", ""or how about a poisonous pancake ?"".) No doubt the filmmakers feared the cencors here, or maybe they thought too explicit violence is a thing of the past. -How right they were; a hitman with dandruff is just what we wanted !. It's a parody, not on something else, but on itself."
4,A good sequel,"My 10 and 6 year old boys loved this series. (This is a middle-grade reading level book, but my husband read it to my boys so they could both enjoy the story.)"
2,No.,I do not like this sequel. The Return of the Indian ruins the innocence of The Indian in the Cupboard.
4,Return of the Indian by Lynne Reid Banks,"""The Return of the Indian"" is a very good and probably better sequel to ""Indian in the Cupboard"".I loved the intense suspense in this book and the creative storyline, but I think the author rushes certain parts that are some of the main points. The summary on the back gives too much away, so don't read it. The story is about a boy with a magical key. When he uses it on a cupboard he found in a street garbage can, the cupboard makes any plastic figure inside the cupboard alive as a mini figure of the real person in time. The people that come alive are really people in time. When something happens to Little Bear, Omri has to call even more figures like a nice nurse, a marine squad with tons of firepower , and a load of angry Iroquois Mohawks who want revenge on the English for burning their homes down. If you have read the first book you'll love the second one to this magical series!by James Lutz"
3,Daniel Bernhardt needs to work on his upper thighs,"I'm not gay but Yeah, the plot was okay. However, Daniel Bernhardt was far too lanky and his upper thighs were very weak especially for his long legs. He can't keep his legs up in the air very long.FURTHER, his chest muscles hardly rippled. They were big chest muscles, but he never flexed them (if he could)."
3,Decent Sequel to Blood Sport.,"When I got this out I wasn't expecting much at all. But I was pleasantly surprised at what I got. It is well structured film (like a real 80's style with a distinct beginning, middle and end not like crappy shallow 90's films which just meander along and feel really empty) Daniel Bernhardt is really charming, a good fighter and looks strikingly similar to Van Damme in some shots. It has one of the best chessy training scenes like the one in kickboxer. The fight scenes are well edited and well shot, so they are easy to watch and not to close-up. For fans of 80's cheese (even if this is a 90's film) and lots of mano a mano fight scenes this should fit nicely in your collection."
4,"Most likely good, read review","This is the second of the two books I purchased for my niece who lives in the Philippines. I have not read it, but being recommended as material for her work, I would say that it is something very useful for children with special needs. I'll say I can also give it a ""4-star"" like I did the other."
3,"Too ""defending the dissertation"" for me....","I ""buy"" it, but the author seems to be trying to defend her point the entire book. I want more current approaches to helping my child. This seems to be more of a dissertation, not a book to help parents."
5,Sensory Integration and the Child,"As an Early Childhood Educator I found this book a solid and easy to read reference tool - for both sharing information with families, clarifying concerns and considering the wide range of diverse principles around working with the challenges of sensory integration issues. Highly recommended for any persons working with families, particularly of young children that are looking for a sensible, highly useful tool to assist in developing knowledge about sensory processing with easily considered checklists. I liked how the book was broken into sections to give overviews about the different areas that could be influenced by sensory dysfunction, how to develop strategies and share with parents/families. The ideas shared are backed up by strong theory based research and language is used that enables the reader to truly engage with shared information Loved it! Lynette"
1,unusable & noisy,"i bought this double cd for ONE song, so i could have it in 320k mp3 format, BUT the cd is copy-protected. so, i can not even exercise my legal right of fair use to make a copy (for listening on mp3 player, etc.). so, it was a total waste of money. most of the songs are really noisy too. ugh."
5,Worth the search!,"I hunted this album down after reading a review in CD Review magazine, and it was definitely worth the search. A true gem, this is one of those rare finds where each listen is just a little better than the last. A great mix of styles, with a fantastic lineup of players lending a hand, and Ms. Vigard's voice is simply flawless. ""Paint My Head"" and ""Slave To My Emotion"" by themselves make this CD worth the cost. I will never part with this CD - it's just too important a part of my collection."
2,Disappointment,"The singer has a beautiful voice but her selection of music was not to my liking.i loved her voice in the video ""Grace of My Heart"" but this CD fell short of my expectations."
4,Good cd,"I absolutely love her voice! I found her through the movie ""Grace of My Heart"", and purchased another cd by her off iTunes called ""Gods, Loves & Angels"", which is amazing! This cd is pretty good, it's a little more jazzy than the other, but it's definitely growing on me with each listen. And did I mention that I love her voice? :-)"
5,kristen vigard,"Good Music. I originally heard one of the songs ""Slave to my emotions"" and it stopped me in my tracks. I looked for the album justs for the song. The rest of the music is good too."
4,Child Actor with Real Musical Talent,"She used to be on a soap opera and was good friends with my God-Sister which is the only reason I had the album, but it blew me away. The music is unique and only seems precocious because of who she is. I'm sorry she never made another one."
1,Don't buy Acurite,I also have 2 Acurite thermometers with remote sensors. Neither one works. Don't buy these!!!!
4,Typical economical tarp.,These tarps are your standard run-of-the-mill tarps you might see at the stores. The camouflage pattern is a nice feature for outdoor / hunting use. The underside is olive drab.
1,Why do the most of reviews of this book appear to be written by the same person?,"If one scans these reviews, with one exception, there is a similarity in tone and style to each review. All of these are written by ""A reader"". A number of them refer to other writers words."
5,An Invaluable Book,"I discovered this book via the video of the same name and when I found out that there was a book, I couldn't wait to read it. I was not disappointed. EXPERIENCING THE SOUL is one of the most valuable works I've ever read (or seen). It spoke to my soul on so many levels, and gave me a much deeper understanding of death - and life.Eliot Rosen speaks from his heart and his own experience, as do a long list of authors and teachers who have dedicated their lives to spiritual development and understanding, from Ram Dass to Stephen Levine to Louise Hay, Gerald Jampolsky, Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, to Sant Rajinder Singh and many more.I will count this book, and the companion video, as essentials in my library, to be reread and rewatched regularly."
2,meh.,"This was dissapointing to me, i was looking for an nyc style yoga/pilates burn.this dvd is instructional and very slow.It would be good for someone older, and out of shape, or maybe for parents and children.His voice is very soothing and pleasant which is nice, all and all its more of a relaxing gentle experience. if thats what you're into... go for it."
5,Yogilates is one of the best workouts and the instructor in this video is excellent!,"The instructor who hosts the video, Jonathon Urla, is by far one of the best instructors I've ever seen on a workout video. And, Yogilates is a phenomenal way to get your yoga, stretches, & Pilates done all at once. I always feel like I've done a serious workout after, while also feeling relaxed & renewed. I highly recommend it!"
5,Intermediate is challenging!,"Definitely not for a beginner. Challenging moves for people with some yoga experience. Negative is that he doesn't know his right from left. 90% of the time, he would get it wrong. Not confusing, but kind of comical. Nice and long (1 hour) with 2 breaks so you don't have to do the whole video at once. Seems a little more yoga oriented than pilates. Doesn't have the super long holds which I find so boring. More constant motion."
4,Yogilates 2 - Intermediate,"This DVD provides an excellent workout, just a little more difficult than Yogilates 1 - Beginners. (Again, my only gripe would be that there is no indication of which moves are Pilates moves, Yoga moves or a combination of both. So, as far as breathing goes, it is always inhale or exhale ONLY. I have been taking Yogilates from an instructor who teaches the difference between Pilates and Yoga breathing techniques and when to use them.)"
2,Yogapilates,Video was really cheesy and only had one sequence that was mildly challenging for someone of intermediate skill.
1,dont bother,"This dvd was like the narrators home movie of his trip. Although, he does give some historical backgrounds to the sights it is definitely not worth what you pay. I was bored with it and it didnt even excite me to want to go on my trip!"
5,Requires at least two readings in a sitting!,"This delightfully illustrated story will appeal to children aged two to five. The first time we read it together, my daughter and I giggled at the clever rhymes, frenzied pace, and sudden ending. The animals get together for a feast, and all the foods they bring are vegetarian. ""Moose bring juice and mice bring rice. Fleas bring peas and flies bring pies."" The story goes faster and faster, the rhyme almost becoming a tongue twister and the food flying around the table. Finally, at the end, the animals collapse into a pile to take a nap! This fun book requires at least two readings in a sitting. Enjoy! -Reviewed by Melanie Wilson"
1,hawthorne,"could not watch as it was not the correct AREA Code for Australia. i did however get a refund, but very disappointed, the first series was wonderful."
4,Love it,This was a great soap opera. The stories where a little short and fast but if you get the entire series and watch it from beginning to end it is a great Weekend watch. lol
2,Performance is good but I hate video touch.,"I chose this DVD based on the name of the quartet. The performance was good to excellent, but I really hate the video part of production. The stage is sometimes completely dark, intentionally. Sometimes it shows only small stream of light to certain player's face. Sometimes the screen shows all the side of players,etc. I guess the producer tried to make his own stage drama based on this music.I was not able to concentrate the music itself because the screen images change through the intention of producer's mind. And also I can not follow through the composer's score by watching players playing. It was really sad that I stopped to watch this DVD as it was too much distract me to watch."
2,Read it before,"I've been enjoying listening to the unabridged book on tape of ""A World Lit Only by Fire"". Desiring to know more about the era, I turned to my copy of Will Durand's (Durant?) tome on the history of civilization. Surprisingly, in his volume ""The Reformation"" I found myself reading almost the exact phrasing found in Manchester's book, same information, same anecdote's. While Manchester does frequently cite Durand, I don't think the citations cover the extent to which Manchester esentially imported Durand into his work. If this were Manchester's solo work, I'd give it five stars..as it is, I don't know how to rate it."
3,"A good read, but how accurate?","I read this book quite a while ago, and recall it as good, if not always light, reading. Seeing the customer reviews here, however, makes it seem that the more a reader already knows about the era, the more likely he or she is to pan Manchester's book. I am reading ""The Year 1000"" right now, and was just thinking this morning that the Manchester book was better, but now I'm not so sure."
5,Masterful Work,"A World Lit Only by Fire, is a succinct, fast paced history of Europe from the fall of the Roman Empire and concluding with Magellan's famous voyage around the world. The life styles, politics and religions of Europeans of the Middle Ages, Renaissance and Luther's Reformation come to life as Manchester skillfully draws a clear, literary picture in slightly less than 300 pages. This is a fast read and recommended for anyone interest (or even slightly curious) about the conditions in which people worked and lived during these periods."
1,Stay away,"William Manchester is an historian capable of excellent scholarship and astute analysis, but you wouldn't know it by reading this book.Manchester commits the all too frequent mistake of viewing history from the present backward rather than from the past forward. This leads him to make simplistic and erroneous statements about the ""Medieval Mind,"" view the Rennaissance as being detached from the Middle Ages, and claim that the ""voyages of discovery"" created the modern world. The book reads more like a bad high school essay than a work by a distinguished historian and author.Indeed, aside from the first thirty pages, the book isn't even about the medieval period. In fact, much of it is not about the Rennaissance, either. The book, which he admits, is mostly about Ferdinand Magellan.So please, stay away from this book. There is nothing to learn from it, and it may give you a bad idea of the kind of historian William Manchester really is."
1,"Ignorance, well-written.","A poorly informed book, written and packaged in an entertaining way. Very unfortunate that a good writer would do so little research before constructing his argument. Please see ""Legends, Lies and Cherished Myths of World History"" by Richard Shenkman for further debunking of old cliches. And this is NOT a ""new"" take on medieval history- it's the same propaganda the renaissance authors pushed centuries ago. Popular history can be great, but only if it also has the facts straight."
5,Amazing Read!,A World Lit Only By Fire is a very interesting and well written book. I usually don't like history books but this book is so well written that I enjoy every minute of it. This book doesn't even have a main story line it's just a ton of interesting historical facts cleverly written to interest you. This book is amazing from start to finish. I suggest that you order this book right away because it is the most interesting and amazing book that I have ever read.
2,With All the Best Intentions...but...,"I respect Mr. Manchester's efforts....He starts out very strong. I was very optimistic with his strong entrance into the era. But it seemed almost like he turned a strong fan on his notes which scattered across the room into utter disorder, and he got very bored when he wasn't talking about Mr. Magellan. I hear it's quite innacurate, and I noticed a great deal of prejudice towards the pagan religions.His erratic writing in certain areas (it seems only when he's bored that he writes this way), he seems almost to be speaking a foreign language."
2,Cliched Pseudo-history,"While, as many other reviewers have noted, Manchester's biography of Magellan at the conclusion of this work is certainly scholarly and insightful, the rest of this text, especially the rather pathetic thirty-page rant against the Church entitled ""The Medieval Mind,"" is consistently shallow and cliched. That the author truly believes that 1,000 years of European history can possibly be summarized accurately in so few words should disqualify this book as a serious, scholarly ""portrait of an age."" In short, Manchester's view of the Medieval millenium as a time of unending brutishness, depravity, and intellectual stagnancy is as thoroughly unenlightened and pseudo-intellectual as the false ""Middle Ages"" which he describes."
5,A Great way to be introduced to the Middle Ages,"Toynbee it is'nt but I really enjoyed it! If one wants to get a great overview of how our ancestors went from what was basically a slum to making Europe the premiere continent for several centuries. Then heres is a great place to start off from. The Authors cast of Characters from Attilla, The various Popes, Henry VIII, Luther, Magellion et al is well chosen and covered. Like the fact the so called two pillars of the Protestant Reformation Henry VIII and Luthor really hated each other with a passion. A real good to go!"
2,Poor condition,"Book was thoroughly marked up, with distracting strike-throughs and underlines. Book was in a much poorer condition than anticipated from description."
1,Old fashioned anti-theism,"Selective scholarship to support his anti-catholic, anti-christian thesis. Not balanced and not enjoyable."
4,Enlightening for the layperson.,"While Manchester acknowledges that he's not an expert in the era, I found the book to be excellent popular history that gave me a much greater feel for the era than weightier tomes ever would have done (since I never would have read them). His intoductory chapter on what it was really like to be a medieval peasant was a real revelation to me (I've seen far too many Hollywood versions of Robin Hood). Life was truly ""nasty, brutish and short."" When I tire of the pain and agony of modern life I only have to read the first 80 pages of this book to realize that we are now living in the best of times (all of our teeth, antibiotics, and hot water). I would recommend the book to any general reader interested in a feel for a far-gone era who isn't interested in becoming an expert."
1,The Most Boring Book I Have Ever Read!,"I was forced to read this book for my AP European History class, and if I wasn't this book would have gone in the trash by the time I had gone through 10 pages. I have read and enjoyed several historical non-fiction books in the past, but this was so much like a history text book that reading it was pure pain. The book focuses so much on the sexual encounters of the people during this age that it is enough to make one sick. It solely talks about the Christian religion as opposed to the actions and ideas of the pagan, Jewish or Muslim reigions. It very rarely talks about anything other than religion, such as the inventions and art and literature that defined the age. In short, don't read this book unless you have a serious sleeping disorder."
4,"easy reading, entertaining, information questionable","although i am not one to read historical nonfiction frequently, manchester's discriptive language (almost too discriptive) encaptures the reader. divided into three sections: the medieval mind (dark ages reflected ignorance, brutality, and prmitiveness prevailed in europe for several centuries) the shattering (characterization of the hypocritical papacy during the high middle ages and early renaissance. he supplements this corruption with illustrative occurences of seduction and lust) one man alone (ferdinand magellan as the epitamy of heroism and exploration, as he circumnavigated the earth he western civilization from ""a world lit only by fire""). a good read; though, how much is true?"
1,"Not a history book, but a 300ish page chip on someone's shoulders",Someone doesn't like the Catholic church and wants you to know it. Contains a bounty of factual errors. I'm glad that I had gotten this from my public library and didn't waste any money on it. Save your money for a real history book.
3,"Entertaining, but not history","The book gives an entertaining and easy reading overview of the Renaissance and Reformation. It is not a serious history book as Manchester admits in his introduction. He borrowed heavily from Durant and other authors for his material with little original research. I found the book confusing as he jumped back and forth over the years to make a point, which left me wondering just what happened when. Often I was left questioning the basis for what were, to me, unbelievable statements. Nonetheless, the book is worth reading."
5,A Good Read,"I enjoyed this book and believe the book is a great read. Some may question its ""facts"" but I noted that some of the accusations are not correct.For example, he never states that Copernicus was burned as a heretic (at least in my hardcopy editon, pages 89-91)and that it was indeed Giordano Bruno who was convicted of being an heretic and burned at the stake.Still, it is not a book for scholors. But for the general reader, it is a good introduction and will make you think about life back then."
2,"Semi-Factual, but unreadable","This was required summer reading for my daughter's 10th grade AP European History class. The assignment also included an essay and a few sheets of fill in the blank questions. For weeks she and her friends struggled with the assignment because of the dry and uninteresting nature of the writing. The time period covered was, in fact, quite interesting, and many writers have covered the material better.I don't recommend this book. I'm an avid reader and medieval history fan, and while I helped her with her questions, reading passages of this book was nearly painful."
4,For School...,Bought this book for my nephew because he needed it for summer reading for high school. He reviews it as very dry with little humor and painful. But he is 17 and he HAS to read this book. It this is something that you are interested in then it is a good read! I read though a lot of it and it isn't my kind of book but it was a decent written book and I would recommend it to history buffs.
1,Chock-full of incorrect or misleading information,"The only thing decent about this book is the treatment of Ferdinand Magellan-- but then, I understand the book is an expansion of an article on Magellan that Manchester wrote earlier. He should have stuck with the article, or written a book just on Magellan.Generally, the book is full of historical views that are outdated, discredited, or just plain without any basis in fact at all. The history of the period has been lumped together into one giant chaotic mass, with little attempt to show change over time. It appears that his main sources for his research were children's history books written before 1950 and Victorian ""historical"" porno novels.It was an enjoyable read, in the sense that such novels as ""Princess Daisy"" are enjoyable, but it is worthless and misleading as a source of actual historical information.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE!"
1,Manchester's Medieval Mistake,"Possibly one of the worst history books ever written. Manchester does not at all stress relevant points. He tries his best to discredit any accomplishments the Medieval Ages have brought. He praises Magellan's colonial efforts, and absoulutely nothing else."
1,Not an honest book,"This book, 'A World Lit Only By Fire', by William Manchester, is an appalling book. Written in a sensationalist, purple prose, and with only a passing swipe at scholarship, Manchester gives such a dystopian vision of medieval and renaissance times that one is forced to approach the book as fiction. I cannot recommend this book to anyone, expert, scholar, or junior high reader. It is false."
1,Oh Dear god,"This book is really bad. It plays on every sterotype possible.I can see why people like it because the author is a good writer. BUT, there is so much wrong with this book its absurd. I literally wanted to rip some of the pages out of this book."
1,So inaccurate as to be a staight lie!,"Just because it is well written, it doesn't mean it's a good book. Full of misconceptions and inaccuracies this book will mislead anyone who does not know something about the subject already. STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK! and more importantly, get it OUT of our schools and universities!How can anyone claim this book is good when the whole point of it is to inform on history and yet it fails to do this in every possible way..."
5,History that shaped the modern world,"A blockbuster of a story about the roots of Western Civilization. Manchester is an entertaining writer with amazing depth and intellectual range. Anyone with interest in history, especially the dark and sordid history of medieval religion should read this one."
1,The worst book on Medieval history I've ever read.,I own upwards of 5000 books. This is the only book I've ever thrown away. The only possible redeaming feature of this book is that it is a catalog of every existing medieval history cliche.
5,This Content Restored My Hope in History,"This is the first history book I have ever found interesting. I don't have a lazy brain, being a technically active person, however, history content has always been so dull I gave up on it starting in fifth grade. That is until I encountered William Manchester's work. I am on my second reading of A World Lit Only By Fire because the topics and style are vastly interesting. Here you will read the truth about pilgrimages, popes and punishment; the brave, the brazen and the blunders that propelled earthlings forward despite the incredible follies of the times. Remove the veil - it's not much different than current times."
3,Catalyst to learn more,"I am not a historian, so I hesitate from passing judgement on the accuracy and completeness of fact, or the integrity of Manchester's interpretations. I am skeptical by nature, so as much of this book might be provacative to some, it has sparked my curiosity.I did find the book an easy, interesting, and at times amusing read, and a catalyst for my additional reading on the era."
2,"Above Average Writing, Below Average (Distorted) History","As an AP World History teacher I had to take a look at this to consider for required reading, and I have to say that I was pretty shocked after reading it that this is used as much as it is in the classroom. Manchester's writing is lively, but his use of sources shows no critical examination. He takes the nobility's appraisal of peasant life at face value, Catholics' characterization of Martin Luther without much balance, and in general overstates the figurative 'darkness' of the Medieval Age.The book is not without legitimate insights, but personally I found it way too much of a mixed bag to endorse, especially for high school readers."
4,"Very Entertaining, But It Ain't History","Manchester's account of the medieval mind is eminently readable and entertaining, but as he himself notes in his introduction, ""this is a slight work, with no pretensions to scholarship"". He is at his best when he expounds on the medieval mindset at the eve of the Reformation, the most solid aspect of the book. But his scholarship is weak in spots, and he has a curious flaw: there is a prurient quality to his commentary on the sexual aspects of history, a jarring note in this most WASP-y of writers. Still, he delivers on the title: reflections on the medieval mind. It's not his best effort by a long shot, but as History Lite, it's highly enjoyable reading."
2,Careless History but a Good Yarn,"The book is a good yarn, I argue, because it brings human scandal (esp. sex, cruelty, pride) into historical narratives, which can sometimes be dry. However, there no serious treatment of the history, no annotation, which is a terrible disappointment. Usually, when you read a history book, you can say ""Oh, that's interesting, I'd like to learn more"" and find further reading in the endnotes or bibliographical essay. None is provided here; so when Manchester says, ""As one historian writes..."" there is no way to see who that person was or continue with the thread."
3,"a good read, in two parts","I was so engrossed in reading that I forgot about Magellan altogether, until suddenly, there he was. It felt like a rude jolt. Once I started reading the part about Magellan, it felt even more like a rude jolt. I've read so many dry history books that reading a flowing narrative was a treat. I found it relaxing, eye opening. I saw the players as people, where as before I'd viewed them as popes, kings, peasants and lumped them into some kind of category. I almost wish he'd gone on longer, spent more time developing the narrative, and left Magellan off completely. Put Magellan in another book, the contrast was too rough."
5,An excellent and entertaining portrait of a time,"I have to say that as I read some of the reviews that I am amazed at some of the arrogance of the reviewers. The fact is that no matter if you are an expert in the period or just someone looking for a good read, an entertaining read, this book does the job well! Prof. Manchester is brilliant in his literal portrait of this period, and as a working historian, I found it enthralling, even if it isn't a so called scholarly work! Popular history is a term used, in my opinion, to describe a book that has color, as opposed to dry fact. Prof. manchester makes some very provocative statements, and presumptions, and I for one found that there WAS merit in his work. Who says you have to be an expert in a given area in order to write an excellent and entertaining work? I highly recommend it."
2,Disappointing,"In his introduction Manchester admits that he is not an expert in the history of the period and goes on to prove it in the rest of the book. He is getting older and it shows with his fascination with the more seedy aspects of 15th century sexuality (some of his sources are less than reliable). He also does not give a balanced picture of the belief system of the common people. His understanding of the Catholoic church of the period is shallow: as in other areas, he only views things from the perspective of an late 20th century American, with all the assumptions and baggage that that entails, rather than understanding his subject from the inside out and in its own time and place. He does try to enliven his subject with well-crafted prose, and seems to have a genuine regard for some of his subjects. If you want a book on this period, you would do better to go elsewhere."
2,I was bored,"I had to buy this book for a summer assignment my sophomore year of high school, and I spent a lot of time reading it and taking notes on it because we were supposed to be tested on it at the beginning of the school year. However, my AP Euro teacher didn't like this book at all, so he didn't test us on it, and we just went over what we were supposed to learn after reading it. I definitely wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, especially when my teacher didn't even think the book was that useful."
4,Positive Reading - not for Catholics,I think many of the negative reviews you see here are from Catholics who are trying to stop you from reading this book. It does not praise the Church during this its worst period of abuses and excess. Many of the errors cited (in these reviews) are those of the reviewers who didn't read very carefully (and didn't want to read very carefully).
2,Hardback Binding Review,"This is a review of the Hardback binding of this book. Don't waste your money - you may as well get the Paperback! This is not a properly printed and bound hardback version of William Manchester's book. It looks like a ""Print-on-Demand"" book i.e. a scanned version of the original that is quickly run off when ordered. Because of the scanning, the illustrations are awful - dark, high-contrast images, lacking detail. The actual binding of the pages is like a paperback ie. individual sheets stuck into a thick wad of glue. They will fall out! Add to that 2 end-boards + an inflexible spine-board and you've got yourself a hardback book (supposedly). For this kind of money, you can get a real (2nd-hand) one from Abe Books."
4,An enlightened commentary on the Middle Ages.,"Manchester's account of the Middle Ages is sweeping and insightful. He covers a vast amount of real estate in a readable, interesting style. The Catholic Church receives the worst reports of an age characterized by worst reports. Clearly, very little of what represented itself as Christian was loving, charitable and forgiving. It was an age best reflected in the quote: ""Life was brutal, hard and mercifully short."""
1,Full of errors and cliches; not a serious history.,"Manchester doesn't even bother to distinguish between the ""Dark Ages"" and the ""Middle Ages"", and it's downhill from there. All the hoary cliches about the benighted filthy peasants and vicious nobles and clergy revived. Some new and interesting stuff about sex in the Middle Ages, however."
2,"Hoo, boy.","I suppose the biggest problem I have with this book is that it does all of its entertaining by repeating partial facts, half-truths, and theories as though they were engraved in stone. It is a fun read, to be sure...if you are into juicy sex and salacious gossip...but people who read it come away with ""facts"" that are often not true at all. Read it, but don't make it your sole source of information, and try to ignore the author's concept that before the Renaissance, it was ALL BAD with NOTHING GOOD at all. Puh-lease."
1,Bleah,"I picked this book up at an airport bookstore, hoping for something interesting and informative to read on my trip to Italy. What I found instead was a historian's version of the National Enquirer - lurid, overly sensational, and thin. I'm just as fond of a good Pope orgy story as the next person, but I object to shoddy research in pursuit of one. My knowledge of the timeperiod covered is slightly better than that of the average person, but I'm no expert, which means that when I start finding factual errors in a history text, something went very wrong."
3,Entertaining but it ain't history,"Manchester's account of the medieval mind is eminently readable and entertaining, but as he himself notes in his introduction, ""this is a slight work, with no pretensions to scholarship"". He is at his best when he expounds on the medieval mindset at the eve of the Reformation, the most solid aspect of the book. But his scholarship is weak in spots, and he has a curious flaw: there is a prurient quality to his commentary on the sexual aspects of history, a jarring note in this most WASP-y of writers.Still, he delivers on the title: reflections on the medieval mind. It's not his best effort by a long shot, but as History Lite, it's highly enjoyable reading."
1,Did only the Catholics light the fire?,"Honest to goodness, I have never read a book that tried so hard, literally page after page, to blame everything negative about the middles ages on the Roman Catholic Church. Everything. More exactly, I think the author occassionally went three pages before he blamed something new on the Catholics. But, at least he was balanced. Mr. Manchester pointed out that anything positive was in spite of the Roman Catholics.I can not recommend this book, or any book, written to prove a presupposition rather than to arrive fairly at a conclusion. Terrible. It offended me not only as Catholic but also as a reader of history."
5,A great way to learn about the medieval era,"This is a wonderful book. I read a borrowed copy 4 years ago and I am buying one now to re-read and to give to my wife. The style of the writing seems very natural to me and makes the many fascinating facts that I had never learned before very easy and enjoyable to digest. I love reading about the medieval era and have read many books about the subject, both historical novels and scholarly. This book is my favorite. ""A Distant Mirror"" was a wonderful book but difficult, I felt, to plow through. One reviewer felt William Manchester was a bit arrogant and derogatory in his dealing with the so called ""dark ages"". I never felt as though he had this attitude, but rather that he gave the details as an impartial observer with a complete command of the subject. I would recommend this book unhesitatingly to anyone interrested in the middle ages, especially those new to the subject, as it is both packed with interresting facts yet not pedantic."
1,An author with an axe to grind,"Mr Manchester has made up his mind and is not to be swayed: Everything bad that happened during the Medieval & Renaissance periods happend because of the Church, and everything good that happened was in spite of the Church. When an author's predjudice is this flagrent, and his research is less than thorough (e.g. he claims that the Medieval Church taught that procreation was evil) it makes it very hard to believe a word he writes."
2,All I have to ask him is ....WHAT?!,"It was mandatory for our class to read A World Lit Only By Fire. I think if the instructor would have read the book first she'd notice that it is filled with confusing babble and unorganized details that don't make sense. I must say that he does have some interesting sides of the stories, but i can't be quite sure if all the information is totally correct."
1,Ridiculous,"Outlandishly silly, full of factual errors and misrepresentations, and poorly organized and written. I find it astonishing that this fellow had an academic appointment (but nowadays perhaps that's not so surprising). Comic relief at best."
1,Waste of paper.,"This book is atrocious. It is almost willfully ignorant about its supposed subject matter, and does little more than repeat long-debunked stereotypes about the ""dark ages."" I have an MA degree in medieval history, and have taught western civ and world history for eight years. Only mentioned to show that I have some actual qualifications for this opinion."
4,"Flawed,but worth reading","The beauty of this book is that is highly accessible,well written and entertaining,makes reading about history fun, and will probably encourage the reader to do a more detailed research on some historical figures within.And yes, it is sometimes incorrect,it should not be the only book read about the medieval ages,because there is a lot missing, and what is in there is sometimes too kinky,too gossip like to be considered as real information.It is so controversial, some people hate it,others love it,if You don't take it too serious it can be fun,and a good start to get You interested in this part of History."
1,"But it's wrong! Wrong, wrong, wrong!","Manchester's style may be entertaining (though not all readers seem to agree even on that), but what he says is flat-out wrong. He admits in the introduction that he doesn't know anything about the Middle Ages and didn't bother to find out; it goes downhill from there.Some previous reviews allege that Manchester didn't mean to write a ""scholarly"" (by which they seem to mean ""boring"") book. That may be so; but even popular history has to get the basic facts right. If you're off by a hundred years in important dates (like the writing of ""The Canterbury Tales""), if you fail to read any of the past century of scholarship on your subject, if you misrepresent reality, that is not ""fun"" history; it's simply a crock."
1,trite,"this book is to history what Maxim magazine is to journalism. Cheezy, trite, sensational. Author has zero understanding of the Renaissance mind (or the medieval one)... reads like a 10th-grader's book report."
3,Very Juicy,This book certainly is juicy- full of all the sort of sex news and human corruption you'd find in the paparazzi pulp literature of the impulse-buy section near the check-out register at your local major grocery store. Fortunately for Manchester (and the reader) the last chapter on Magellan's great voyage around the world is so fascinating that it almost redeems the first 200 pages of this true sleaze 'literature'. This book should be subtitled 'Sex Sells'.
1,Awful,"This book came highly reccommended, so I was expecting something at least factually accurate - but it was abysmal. His analysis of the just-post-Roman Christian Church in particular was PAINFUL to read. It was quite clear from his writing that he had not bothered to return to the source documents themselves but had simply stuck with others' interpretation of Christianity. He perpetuated several urban myths about the history of Christianity, and his interpretations of medieval life seemed to assume, frequently, that medieval people not just thought about the world differently than we do (a valid assumption) but that they were substantially dumber than we are (invalid).A student who turned in a paper to me citing this book as fact would probably get points off automatically for lack of ability to adequately analyze sources for factual accuracy. I only finished it out of morbid curiosity."
2,ENTERTAINING BUT HARDLY SCHOLARSHIP,"I HAVE READ MOST OF MANCHESTER'S WORKS AND FOUND THIS ONE TO ENTERTAINING READING BUT HARDLY SCHOLARLY. THE SEX LIVES OF POPES, CARDINALS AND NUNS WOULD MAKE A GOOD PLAYBOY SHORT. IN FACT AT TIMES THE BOOK SEEMS LIKE AN ANTI CATHOLIC POLEMIC. IF YOU NEED TO GET INFORMATION ABOUT THE ERA GO BACK TO HUIZINGA AND TAKE A TRIP TO FLORENCE. IF YOU WANT A BOOK TO TAKE ON VACATION THIS ONES OK"
3,Fair,"This book is fairly well written and the plot is mildy interesting. But I never really sensed that much chemistry between the heroine and hero. The heroine was way too juvenile and guileless for my taste, and I felt that the abrupt ending lacked dramatic tension.In short, not bad, but hardly a page turner."
3,Might be a Nice Read for Some,"I agree with the other reviewer that the romance and plot kind of fizziled out a little over half way through the book. However, if you just think of the book as ending at this point, it is a nice read."
4,Wacky inspired fun,"This is nice..Why is it so rare that a game, a format that we literally can put as much stuff into as our imagination can hold, so often falls flat in the creativity department, relying on tired old familiarities instead of pushing the envelope? Toonstruck is a rallying cry against this..The developers manage to pack more cartoon/human puch then cool world could ever muster up..Christopfher Lloyd has got to be one of the best video game actors ever, and is perfect in the role of the troubled artist who is transported to a cartoon world in which he has to figure his way out of..Get it to be reminded of the creativity and imagination lying dormant in this genre.."
