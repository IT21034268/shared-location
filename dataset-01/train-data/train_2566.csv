5,Seiko quality.,"I sit in the quasi-dark watching TV and I can't see our clock over the fireplace. So, with the touch of a button I can light up the display and quickly see the time on my Seiko on my table by the sofa -- the display is large and the unit is small. Seiko quality and I love the Atomic time. The alarm is very easy to set up.I have no need to set up this unit for international time, but I suspect that if one were to read the directions thoroughly, one would be able to have the time set automatically."
4,Nice clock,"This is a great little alarm clock. It has nice large numbers that are easy to read. I especially like that it will automatically set it self, keeping the time correct. It tells you the day and date which keeps even us forgetful folks on the right date. At first I didn't really think I needed the tempature feature, but it is really a very nice feature--you know if you will need that extra blanket. The alarm starts out low and then increases in volumn, it doesn't blast you out of bed, or give you a heart attack, but it will ensure you hear it. The only negative that I see, is that when used as a travel alarm it does not have a cover over the screen. I fixed this by just making a little padded pouch to put it in, before putting into the suitcase. I give it 4 stars, and would recommend it."
1,Horrible,"I love Seiko watches, so I had high hopes for this clock. It malfunctions constantly, the atomic portion doesn't work, and it's very cheaply built. Terrible product, boo Seiko"
4,"Nice, but should be easier to set","I would give this travel alarm five stars but for how difficult it is to set US time zones. I've owned other self-setting alarms, and setting the time zone has always been easy. With this alarm, the first setting took me forever, with little help from the incomprehensible printed instructions. But for that, the clock is great, with automatic setting for all US time zones (including Alaska and Hawaii), Japan, and much of Europe.The alarm is easy to set and easy to put on snooze.This is not the travel alarm for those who want a very small and light model, but it has all of the features I like, including temperature in Fahrenheit of Celsius, and the buttons are well protected while the clock is packed."
2,can't see the clock in the dark,We already sent it back. We need a clock that stays lit all the time and this one does not.
4,Travel alarm,This clock seems to be a good one. Small enough to pack and large enough to see at night.Have only had it a couple weeks.
3,OK but mildly frustrating,"We must not be in range for the atomic function to work - since it never has in the 5 or so years we've owned this. So, without that function, it's OK. It keeps time well but the alarm is quite shrill and loud - more than we need since we're not deep sleepers. I echo someone else's comments that settings are not intuitive so every year (twice) I spend a few minutes trying to work out how to apply or remove the DST function. I often end up settling for a neighboring time zone instead. Are all atomic alarm clocks like this?"
4,Masterful !,"Amazing, wild, story lines. A rip roaring ride through the years of better living through chemistry. The characters are complex, alive and humorous. Throughout this literary journey I felt a deep down suspicion that I had met a few of these people somewhere before and been to some of the places. As a kid I dreamed of being a writer someday and if that ever happens I would love to be this witty, creative and entertaining. Coming of age in the 60's was both glorious and horrifying. Richards poetry and prose combined with flowing sarcasm helped me survive those times."
5,its good to be a loser,"ok- this book is pretty brilliant... despite the fact that the artwork included is a catalogue of some of the most important, interesting and (previously- time will tell??) underground /fringe dwelling artists and contemporary contributors in the last 25 or so years and that in itself is reason enough to love this book, you would be CRAZY not to read the essays... they are insane- so brilliant and you are not even touching the surface of this book unless you read them..if you have any interest in graf/ skating/ contempory artists / beautiful things / whats going down then youll love beautiful losers and regret very badly that you didnt get to see the exhibition...like i am now."
2,shoddy,"Wood not cut very good. Big cracks in floor. Makes terrible lot of racket when pulled with 4 wheeler. Had to put in different floor, and rebrace sides so it didn't make so much racket. Tires cheap. I will upgrade tires at some point. Wheels run on shaft(not bearings) Did not sit level when hooked up. Had to cut part of tongue off and re-position hitch."
4,Jataka tale rewritten for children,"Jataka tales are similar but not identical in structure to the animal fables of the West. One difference is that the characters are less ""black and white"" - the crocodile is clever, the monkey is cleverer. Neither is foolish.Jataka tales are stories of previous births of the Buddha i.e. similar to the more complex avadanas that are translated from the Sanskrit or Tibetan traditions. While the children's books of them are fun and well worth reading, at some point reading a more comprehensive selection should be on the agenda. This book is just a fun introduction for a young child."
3,Educational,This book is quite educational...but is a STUDY about 24 women. Make sure you realize that before buying it! It is very bogged down with psychology and quoting Erickson and those guys...so be ready to put your thinking cap on for this one. It is not a story...it is a study. Filled with quotes from the 24 women who were RESEARCHED. As long as you know that...then go for it.
3,"Would have liked more indepth information about the ""process"" of the transformation of the women","I would have liked more information about the ""process"" these women took to leave their lives with husbands, to fully become ""lesbian"". Otherwise the book was smart with the questions and answers from those interviewed. It would seem all the women interviewed always knew their orientation, but didn't act upon it. I was looking for a good ""process"" book for female clients in their early stages of ""coming out"".A three star rating. from Judy, Family Therapist"
2,Title?,"Judging from the title, you would expect this book to be about all kinds of women (including singles) who have lesbian epiphanies in later life. The book is overfocused on married (or formerly married)women to the exclusion of single-never-marrieds. This approach biases the general discussion as well as the handling of research findings. A big disappointment."
2,Could benefit from recent scholarship and more,"Reads great--I enjoyed it much like the DaVinci Code, but with a great deal of informed skepticism.Plus it needs to be proofread for textual errors. Page 206 refers to a ""Nazarite Sect"" and I think it was supposed to say ""Nazarene."" There are other problems like that."
3,It's really about the Covenant,"After thinking about it, I think Kinall is in fact the villain that his society makes him out to be. His behaviour is the image of the drug addict--he deludes himself, destroys his family and every single person who loves and tries to help him, engages in increasingly self-destructive acts, and goes out in a blaze of messianic self-glorification. I kept waiting for a dramatic breakthrough, and I was thoroughly taken in. This is not a manifesto in favor of self. It's a satire on the pitiable drug culture that destroys people."
2,Incomplete and waste of time,"This cd is not the true Bryan Adams greatest hits album. The true Bryan Adams greatest hits album remains ""So Far So Good"". This cd is missing several of his biggest hits, including ""Heaven"". The cd lags at times and just doesn't have the same fire as ""So Far So Good"". Pass on this cd, it just isn't worth it if you're a casual fan. This is only for hardcore Bryan Adams fans."
3,Best of Me,"I like Bryan Adams' music but I must say, this CD was a bit slow paced even for me. I was nearly put to sleep by most of the songs. It left me wanting for more, which I know he is capable of delivering. Not your typical Bryan Adams you're used to. This one is not one of my favorite Bryan Adams CD."
4,Bryan is still the Best,"I was browsing the music store when I stumbled upon this. I've always been a Bryan Adams fan, but I only owned 'So Far, So Good'. I saw this, saw that it had some of the same tracks...but other Bryan Adams songs that I've heard on the radio...I had to get it. I wasn't disappointed. I love the first track, 'Best of Me'! Was glad to get 'Have You Ever Really Loved A Woman?' AND 'All For Love' without having to buy the movie soundtracks. But where was 'I've Finally Found Someone'? The only major drag. Fell in love with 'Inside Out' and 'Cloud Number Nine'. I had been wondering what had happened to Bryan Adams. After listening to this album, I went to Zia's Record Exchange and bought all of the Bryan Adams albums that I could find - I didn't even know about 'On A Day Like Today', & it's my favorite with '18 Till I Die' and 'Waking Up The Neighbors'. Of course, I have the 'Spirit' soundtrack. Can't wait for a new album by Bryan."
4,"well, could have been a bit better but good anyway","The Best of Me is my first Bryan Adams cd. I absolutely fell in love with the songs ""The Best of Me"" and ""Cloud Number nine."" Otherwise none of the other songs were exactly bad. They are good for listening to when you are bored but are not the best stuff I have listened to. The Spirit: stallion of the Cimarron soundtrack is much better; when you want really good music then listen to that. Also the cover art is not so great."
5,Een pracht van een cd,"Heb de cd gekocht nadat ik TW classic bezocht heb...Ik kwam thuis, en zag dat ik geen enkel nummer had van Bryan Adams. Dit kon ik niet zo laten..."
1,Has Bryann Lost the Plot?,"I used to be a big Bryan Adams fan but me and me mates went to see him last night and i was upfront dancin away with Anne and Joanne and we were really happy and we wus shouting 'spit on me Bryan, spit on me Bryan' and i swear to God during Back to You he gobbed right on me. Jesus i swear to God, never again will i listen to him"
3,Best of...not quite,"This was released 2 1/2 years ago in the UK with pretty much the same track listing. If it were to be a companion 'hits' package to SO FAR SO GOOD, it should have included songs not on that and then the newer hits. Missing from it is his last top-ten hit I FINALLY FOUND SOMEONE with Barbra Streisand, THOUGHT I'D DIED AND GONE TO HEAVEN, ON A DAY LIKE TODAY, THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER TONIGHT, DON""T GIVE UP and others. The 'new' song BEST OF ME was also released a couple years ago and really isn't that great. Too bad, this could have been better. (the artwork is really bad too.)"
4,Great CD,I bought this CD because I wanted some of Bryan Adams' best songs to play at my wedding. CD came very fast; I only wish that he would let his music be sold on Itunes. Frustrating! Now I have a CD that can sit in my car forever.
1,Bryan Adams Must Be Stopped,"If you're not convinced that Bryan Adams must be stopped after lisenting to this album, you probably are beyond help. Adams is the worst of incencere radio pop, and if rock and roll is really dead someone had better check Bryan for the smoking gun. It's a rare artist whose can add artistic legimacy to his career by doing a song with a Spice Girl."
1,Why Must we suffer?,"I am sitting here in an office being forced by my colleague to listen to this CD and what can i say but- Is he the male Celiene Dion? I just cannot get over how bland and truly awful the music is. If there were a Comission for Crimes Against Music he would be suspect number one. Everytime i hear his music my skin simply crawls.Please tell me i am not the only one?Back to the album- what i can i say but truly, truly appalling."
4,more of the best from Canada's Best BRYAN ADAMS,"Part 2 of Adams hits are feautred here. Hits from ""WAKING UP THE NEIGHBORS""(1991) ""RECKLESS""(1994) AND ""ON A DAY LIKE TODAY""(1998) All of these songs are very good and reminds the listener that Bryan Adams hasne't slowed down even if the ill-fated ""18 TILL I DIE"" Realase was considered by many to be a weak point. But if you want to listen to Adams's classic tracks as well as the new hits then this is the complation worth getting."
4,The best of ...part 2,"No doubt, their is many hits on this cd, but there is as much songs missing, This cd is a good addition to ""So far, So good"". If you want all the best, then you must own twose two cd. ""The best of me"" contains more recents hits but has too many songs ommited, you will find these on ""So far, So good""."
5,great book,will make a great gift for any aspiring poker player a great text tips and strategies a great read for all ages .learning poker has never been so easy to understand be the best player you can be get this book !!
1,bad bad bad,"This product will constantly do pop-up ads on your desktop telling you to buy their email protection product, etc. There is no way to disable these. It seems they aren't happy to get my money, they want more and more and have no respect for my privacy."
1,I'm a believer,I was considering buying this Version 8. I have Version 7.0 and have had no problems. But where there is smoke there is fire. I wonder if it has to do with the new Windows Upgrade from Microsoft. I THINK I WILL PASS ON THIS ONE. THANKS FOR THE ADVICE CUSTOMERS.
1,The worst $250 I have ever spent,"I thought McAfee was a reputable company before purchasing this software.When I first installed the software, I had also changed several other items on my computer. I noticed soon after I couldn't log onto the internet. There were also little problems with Windows. About a month later, our hard drive died. We figured it was a few years old and maybe we had contracted some sort of virus.Within a week we had a new clean hard drive and I began to install all of our programs one by one. After installing this software, I was immediately unable to access the web because my DSL line was busy. It turns out when I had installed the software it established it's own way of connecting to the internet. It also screwed up my Internet Explorer configuration and I am still trying to figure out how to reconfigure Windows so I can do simple things such as move items on my desktop.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
1,They can have it back,"Rather than flog a dead horse, I'll just say my experience was similar to others who have given this software 'one star': frustrating to install and try to get working, impossible to get rid of easily, and tech support was absolutely no help. I returned mine even though opened software qualifies for only a partial refund. I wouldn't use this if they were giving it away."
2,boring,i tried to read it but it is soooo boring and the things it is talking about are things i have never heard of.ingredients it suggests to use are not easy to find.didnt like it
5,Excellent Resource,"This book is amazing, it is so undersold by the title, ""Natural Baby and Childcare""! It is The Bible for taking care of your child naturally, without having to go to the Doctor. Dr. Feder is a pediatrician and it's clear that she believes that the parent knows best and really encourages parents to do their own research. Well done, an essential for all parents!!"
2,Not helpful when I needed it,"One of the few times I needed a baby reference book, this one was not helpful. My son had Coxsackie Virus, which is very common among babies and children. The book offered a very short, general paragraph on the illness that did not provide any insight in addition to what I was witnessing firsthand. A friend had lent me Dr Sears' book and it was much more descriptive and informative."
5,Great book for adults too!,"Natural Baby and Childcare is a great book for treating conditions in adults as well as children. While I was visiting my daughter and grandchildren, I came down with a cold, and used Dr. Feder's book to treat my symptoms. The A to Z section on treating illnesses was easy to navigate and understand. I appreciated the guidelines on home treatments and found the right homeopathic medicine for my symptoms. I feel that the treatments allowed me to heal quicker and enjoy my time with my family. I would recommend this book to adults too!"
5,The very best rolls,"Cooking from Quilt Country is one of my favorite cookbooks. The Overnight Butter Rolls are my family's absolute favorite rolls. This year was my fourth in a row to serve them for Thanksgiving dinner. They are always a hit. Several of my relatives eat so many rolls they don't want anything else. Other favorites: Homade Noodles, Amish Brown Sugar Pie and Apple Cake with Hot Carmel Sauce (incredible!!!). I like the fact that most of the recipes are made with things you already have on hand."
5,Best basic amish book,Marsha Adams has written the best book on the subject ever. I am a professional chef but enjoy looking to our heritage. The pat in the pan pie crust is the best. It is one of my most used books; one can tell by how dirty the pages and hand written notes. It is a must for any one. All of Marsha's books are a must. I tell every one about them.
2,"If you loved math class, this is the Duke book for you.","Well, truthfully, I didn't love math class in school so I found this approach to understanding the Duke phenomenon - with all its charts and statistics - to be difficult to endure. What good are the statistics when you're dealing with a candidate who wins by flying under the radar anyway? But hey, to each his own side of the brain. More artistic types should read the review on Michael Zatarain's ""David Duke - Evolution of a Klansman."" That's the one to buy."
3,Not their best...,"This album isn't their best. It's hard to understand what they're singing half the time, whereas their albums you can hear it smoothly. I don't like the sound of this one. I'm glad they got better with time. ""So Much For The Afterglow"" is much better - if you're interested in Everclear, check out that album."
4,Better than some of her other tapes,"This was a pretty good tape--I was actually more interested in the audiotape that came with it. It is exactly what is on the video. The second side of the audiotape has just music, and it would have been nice to have the pieces flow into each other, and not have breaks between them.Denise is not the best to watch for technique--she wobbles on just about all of the standing positions--and the beautiful desert scenery, while nice to look at, kind of distracts you from what you're supposed to be doing.She is not as chatty as on some of her other tapes, but for a Yoga tape, she is still too loud. Borrow before you buy. Her Pilates tape is better."
1,save your money,Yoga essentials best describes what happens when someone who is a novice in Yoga like Denise Austin tries to pass herself off as a Yoga Teacher. Her peppy antics may work well for her on her morning show but is completely distracting in its translation to Yoga instruction. The production looks as thrown together as the the workout. She should stick to what she does best and leave Yoga videos to real teachers.
3,great but unnecessary,"Let me make clear that I love the Buzzcocks. They are probably still in my ten-favorite-bands-ever list. But this expensive single disc is in fact available as half of the double-disc set ""Beating Hearts"" which costs way less than this! Makes no sense at all.So, I suggest you buy ""Beating Hearts"" which has ths whole show, plus a different show from the Manchester Apollo, Dec. 14th 1978. Although be forwarned, the tape speed on the Manchester show is noticably fast, resulting in everything sounding speeded-up and higher pitched - it's too bad unfortunate that nobody bothered to fix that in the CD transfer.In any case, this show from 1979 captures the band in top form, with great song selection. It's a first-rate live punk album from the best punk/power pop band ever. But buy ""Beating Hearts"" and save some money."
3,Rats in the Grain,"If you are looking for an account with the readability of a Michael Lewis book or perhaps the Jonathon Harr legal drama ""A Civil Action,"" this is not the book. It's an important work and higlights critical market information which most of us should understand better -- namely global commodities trading and market ""efficiencies."" However, the lengthy trial descriptions were -- in my opinion -- too detailed and quickly became tedious. By the end of the book, I suspect most will think twice about turning state's evidence at any trial. Moreover, the book raises the question of how much any of us can believe in ""free markets."" In its most downbeat take-away, ""Rats in the Grain"" illuminates how, for a few bad actor corporations, customers are the enemies and competitors are friends."
3,This story has been told,"I have not read this book, but it seems that the publisher's statement here at Amazon should include some mention of what this book can tell us that Kurt Eichenwald's exhaustive, prizewinning book, _The Informant_, does not. Eichenwald's book covers exactly the same material, and Eichenwald (the _New York Times_ reporter who covered the case) had the same access to Whitacre and other sources that Lieber had.For obvious reasons, I would prefer not to give a ""number-of-stars"" rating to a book I haven't read. But Amazon demands it, so I've chosen a neutral ""three."""
5,Lieber nails the truth on the head,"Anyone interested in knowing the truth about the dangerous extent to which our U.S. Judicial System has beeen compromised by corporate influence must read ""Rats In The Grain"". Mr. Lieber's research is thorough and his writing style is very readable. Archer Daniels Midland is an outlaw organization acting with near impunity. The real tragedy, however, is that our U.S. Justice Department has been a party to covering up thier crimes. I strongly recommend this read."
5,Legal Thriller!,"An intriguing story on the price fixing scandal at ADM in 1995. Also, the book highlights the pervasive web of influence of ADM's and Dwayne Andreas' in political circles through special interest groups, on both a national and international level. Throughout the years, ADM has very effectively managed to drive demand for corn fructose syrup by keeping sugar prices artificially high. Also, how ""green"" is the sometimes controversial ethanol(fuel additive derived from corn)? To ADM, very ""green."" Does the already profitable ADM really need the $430 million government grant for ethanol production? Very well-written and documented by the author, a labor and civil rights attorney."
2,Wish I would have done more research,"These cameras work great in well-lit conditions. However, these are worthless as ""Securicams"" as the package labels them, since they can't even see my front porch from my front window (3 feet away) with the porch light on at night. I bought two of these and I regret it. Look for at least one of them on eBay soon. Also, they don't support WPA."
3,Wireless mode not working,"The camera worked fine with wired configuration. For some reason the wireless mode is not working for me. After talking to the D-Link tech guy, he recommanded return the product as defective item. I don't know if just my luck of getting a bad one or not. Thinking to re-order it again and see what happen."
1,DOA,"This camera failed to work from the moment I plugged it in. The lights flashed virtually at random... the power light would sometimes blink on and off, sometimes it would stay solid. The ethernet light would blink once every minute or so at some times, and at others, even when it wasn't plugged into anything, it would stay solid. After a brief conversation with their technical support staff, it was determined that my product was defective. I tried two separate routers, and neither detected it. The reset button didn't appear to work, either.I was really excited about this, but now I'm not so sure. I'll certainly be leery of purchasing a D-Link product in the future. I guess we'll see how well the replacement works.Edit: The wireless capability is broken on the replacement unit. D-Link has earned my life-long enmity."
1,I swore I would never buy a D-Link product again...,"And I was right....I should have passed on this. It was a pain to configure, and then none of the settings would stick. Whenever I changed the default password, it would never let me log back into the camera without having to do a reset. That kind of defeats the point. Returning this item so I can get something decent. The money saved is NOT worth it!"
4,BIEN,"ESTA CAMARA ESTA BIEN, NO TIENE MUCHA NITIDEZ PERO ESTA BIEN. AUNQUE ME VINO UNA DEFECTUOSA Y ESTOY ESPERANDO QUE ME LA REINTEGREN."
1,Received a defective camera - Dlink bad decision,"I bought this camera and just when I am out of the country installing it I get the tech support guys tell me to send it back, lost my money, never again buy dlink. This was my first and last dlink product."
3,Adequate. Just adequate.,"This is a wireless internet camera, which means that it can send images, without a direct wired connection, live over the internet using a built-in web browser. It's about half the price of the Toshiba IK-WB01A, and that's about right. I own both. The DCS-900W has far better wireless range, which is what you would expect from D-Link. But the visual quality is very poor in anything less than direct sunlight (it requires 2.5 lux!), even in bright light it's not very good or vibrant, there's no remote pan-and-scan, no audio, and the camera CPU seems quite slow. The software is fine though, perhaps better than Toshibas, except that you must load a CD to set it up initially.So for the money it's fantastic. Since I bought it to aim at the puppy's kennel, it will be fine. We'll be able to see him in there. But you really do get what you pay for."
1,Discontinued -- Year 2001 technology,"This camera has been discontinued by D-Link. It will not work with Silverlight, XP service pack 2, or Vista. Mine wouldn't even be recognized by my router (but I think that mine was defective). Unless you have legacy hardware (Pentium III, Windows 98SE, etc) I wouldn't buy this camera. And the D-Link tech support is free, but I waited two hours to talk to someone, who got my model # and then the phone disconnected."
2,Disappointing,"It took 45 minutes and two different tech support guys to set the camera up to talk with our Linksys router, and then it turned out that if the camera is more than 15 feet from the router, it can't pick up the signal. In afternoon light, and close to the router, the picture is quite good. However, it's useless to us!"
5,pingel,they have done a good description of the object and they sent it very quickly.I tried to buy this article on ebay and I was impossible.
5,Not for the average techno fan,"This CD is excellent. Aparently, some guy wrote a review on this CD thinking that it would be some goofy ... death metal CD. Guess what, It's not. This is straight forward Hardcore Gabber Speedcore. If you are expecting techno or death metal, look elsewhere. This CD is a masterpiece and bound to be a classic."
2,Too much time spent watchin' movies,"I read the reviews and heard about the whole scene and speed of the music and i was really looking foward too this album. This was the first speedcore/ gabba album i'd ever heard and i was ... exicted.Let me tell you something.... There is a constant, pretty boring and formulaic beat which is fast but not that fast which is evident in every single song. This is an instant turnoff, i mean one or two songs containing that beat is cool but every ... song!There are few variations and minute snippets of techno, gitaurs and drums. This album however does have potential, you just have to add some mental drumming, gitaurs and death metal vocals and alot of bass.Reviewers say its hardcore but i think Slayer is much more intense (and i think Slayer is semi-hardcore). D.O.A however does include some great samples from top films like Goodfella's.PS. Is this album representitive of the scene?"
5,DOA Defines Hardcore,"Disciples of Annihilation's album ""New York City Speedcore"" is truly a monumental CD. Audio horror of this caliber is not easy, but great, to come by. The only thing I disliked about this CD is... wait, there's nothing I dislike =P If you don't already have this disc, BUY IT. But you can find it cheaper than twenty-eight bucks, trust me. Try ordering from Earache themselves- they sell it for nine."
1,Disappointing,"Unlike some of the other Adobe Classroom in a book guides, this one was a great disappointment. Most of the lessons leave out half of the steps required to get to the ""final"" result, which is pretty frustrating if you are a beginner to the program, like I was. Buyer beware."
2,New users....beware!!!,"Speaking for a novice user, I really do not recommend this book. Constantly reference to the User's Guide makes this Classroom in a Book a bad option for beginners and all of us, new users. Trying to take the learning more seriously and our money well spent should simply warn us from buying this book!"
1,Lame Tutorial - Worst of the series,"The first half of this book is an exact duplicate of the tutorials that come with the program. Only useful if you are a pirate, as if you purchased the program you already have it. The second half is filled with fairly lame overview tutorials that don't do much as far as real-world, professional techniques. Instead of the project oriented approach of the other Adobe Classroom In a Book titles (which are typically very good) this one just shows what a few of the tools do by letting you complete a half-way done task. This is definitely the worst of all the Classroom-In-A-Book titles. Save your money and buy The Illustrator Wow Book which provides a much more complete and professional treatment of this subject."
1,"Meets minimum requirements, first part of book is OK","In lesson 18 pages 246,247 the picture of the file (isometr1.ai)one is supposed to use for doing the lesson is not in the cd-rom, so the lesson cannot be performed. Additionally, when one draws the rectangles(doing exactly as instructed)for doing item 8, the instructions do not work. Lesson 16 is poorly written."
3,"Nice way to learn the basics, but that's about it",No one book is going to teach you all you need to know about Illustrator. Nice starting point for beginners. Not suited for anyone with intermediate and above knowledge. Crucial steps are left out of some of the tutorials. Writers assume too much of the readers (like they read the user manual cover to cover).
1,Very Frustrating,"I am a college student majoring in Multimedia Publishing. This book was used as the Pagemaker textbook for my digital publishing class, and I found it very frustrating. The step by step instructions were very unclear on some parts and hard to follow. I felt as if steps were being skipped, and things just weren't explained well enough for me. Also, the fact that some of the needed fonts were missing from the disc did not help matters. If not for my class instructor, I'm not sure I would have learned anything with this book alone. I know this is supposed to be one of the better books out there, and it may be good for tips for those who are more experienced, but if you are a beginner like me, I STRONGLY suggest that you find another book!"
1,Very limited and lacking in instruction,Not good for the beginner or any user. Lessons only half complete with frequent references to the User Guide and Web Site for more information on topics presented.
2,Not Impressed,"I'm not impressed with this book at all. Seems to be aimed at people with a low education. I'll recommend it to anyone who didn't graduate pass the sixth grade. If you want good fantasy read Terry Brooks.Characters with names like Marrow(skeleton), everyone in a certain raced names like Chex, Cherie, Chet, Chester and it goes on and on. Grow up Mr. Anthony this is sixth grade reading."
2,Not what I thought,"I was recommended this by a friend but sadly it's not the story of a small water mammal who, in the throes of existential crisis, rescues his tiny community on the banks of the Thame from a series of rapacious raids by mink led by the evil Bliar.I suppose it's all very well for those who like this sort of thing, but it's not really reading as such, is it?"
2,Fancy names - little information,"if you are confused about cytokines, have free time on hands time and do not know what to do with it- read this book, it will make you mind even more confused. Sorry!"
1,Defective Product,"After about 200 pages, this toner cartridge started printing gray stripes down the center of each page. Since more than 30 days have passed since I received the order, I'm not sure I can return it. Think twice about buying a toner cartridge or similar product..."
3,It's OK for a battery radio,"FOr the price and convience of having a portable emergency battery radio, its OK.The AM/FM tuner is OK. It's not great. It's not very precise and you need to fiddle with the tuner to get your station locked in.The shortwave is hit or miss.The light works.The hand-crank broke after 3 times using it. It seems it was glued. It was easily fixed using plastic crazy-glue, but somewhat disappointing.I really wanted a FreePlay radio, but I couldn't justify the price. This radio is OK if you have a fresh supply of AA batteries and some crazy glue :)Peace"
2,The dynamo died young,"The Grundig FR200 Emergency Radio has the right features except no Solar aollector. It's radio section worked OK, Nothing special, but it did work. The Flashlight feature might be a life saver in some situation, but I am not sure I need that integrated into my radio. What did not last was the dynamo as a power source. the Dynamo still makes power but very early, it stopped being available to the radio for some reason, I took it apart and traced it. the rechargeable battery was easily charged by cranking for five minutes but nothing would get that electricity to the radio or light. Basically what befell it is a cheap switch and poor quality control at the factory. If an emergency product is going to be this expensive, you need to make it better."
2,Good Little Radio,"It got low stars because the antenna they spec on it is very fragile, which is not what you want in an emergency radio.The fine tune nob works great and we were able to listen to music and games in the backcountry while rafting."
3,Great radio if it worked,"I got this radio because I like that all my appliances are now battery or crank powered.Unfortunately, out of the box, the radio failed to store a charge and the built in light is broken. The NiMH battery connector was bad - so I resoldered it. I'm not sure why the light doesn't work and I don't have an easy way to replace it."
5,"""Just what I wanted in a radio""","The Grundig FR 200 was just the small type of camping / emergency radio that I was looking for to carry on short camping trips etc.It is lite weight and has a smooth band search with a good sound.The light is an extra touch for those times in the tent when you need it.Its just what it says it is ""An emergency radio,constructed well"".I'm listening to the Baseball game now as I send this message."
1,Grumpy-2,"I had the same experience as reported by Grumpy, so I don't think the attitude is grumpy at all. I have had two of these (also not from Amazon), and I was pleased to have a found a good way to listen to radio in the garden while I work.Mine (both) worked well initially, but both gave it up quite soon. After a few hours, each of them only worked on the wind-up generator for a few minutes. Each minute of winding might only yield five minutes of play now, regardless of volume.The solar power option still works. Oh well."
1,"Stay away, Grundig FR200 is useless junk",I did not purchase this from Amazon. I had my FR200 radio for a while and was pretty pleased with myself when the power went out... until I tried to actually use it. Cranking it for ten minutes yielded me about two minutes of radio time. I would have been much better off with a cheap transistor radio and some batteries in a drawer. Both the website and the phone number on the box are no longer valid and no one will work on this thing. Like other reviewers I relied on the Grundig name but this turns out to be some Chinese-made junk. Stay away.
2,"Good AM/FM reception, but it fails as an ""emergency"" radio.","I've owned this radio for approximately three years now. Its primary purpose for me is to allow me to listen to radio in an emergency situation, when I don't have power. I played with it a few times over the last three years, and put it away for an emergency. Fortunately, I never had one. I moved about a year ago, and played with it again when I was unpacking, and all was well. When I heard others talking about emergency radios recently, I pulled it out of its drawer again, and found out that some time in the last 10 months, its dynamo system quit working. It will power the light while I'm cranking, but not the radio (or maybe I just can't crank hard enough to get any volume). And neither the light nor the radio will work off of the rechargeable battery. May be an easy fix, I don't know. I haven't taken it apart yet, but for anything billed for ""emergency"" use, I shouldn't have to."
3,Don't count on the light,"I bought the radio in case of an emergency at home. I appreciate the radio reception but have not been able to use the light feature. The light worked when I first took it out of the box but stopped working shortly after. I called Eton customer service, who sent me a new light bulb. It was the wrong light bulb so I called again. They sent me the correct light bulb but replacing the old was complicated. There is no instructions for bulb replacement included with the radio. After managing to replace the bulb, it still did not work. Without instructions I can't know if the problem is with me, the bulb, or the radio."
1,Rechargable batteries gave out,I bought this product a few years ago and kept it in my closet for an emergency.I took it out the other day to test it out and found that the rechargeable batteries would no longer hold a charge after cranking the handle. It doesn't even work for 2 seconds after 30-50 cranks of the handle.The only way to make it work is to install 3 AA batteries.This clearly defeats the purpose of having a hand crank radio.
1,short battery life,"I agree with other reviewers. the radio works fine , but you are constantly cranking this thing to keep it running, ESPECIALLY if you try using the flashlight feature.Perhaps I need new battery, but the crank problem has been present since I bought it."
3,Tippy radio spills its batteries,"I use my Grundig FR200 around the house to listen to AM talk radio. It works fine for that. I've had it 2-3 years now.The pot (potentiometer) is awful -- you have to really play with the knob to get the volume where you want it.It is very ""tippy"". I must knock it over weekly. This always causes the battery cover to fall off and the 3 AA batteries and the built-in rechargeable battery pack to fall out. It's a very tight squeeze; difficult to get them all back in and the cover closed. I'm considering duct-taping it shut.Cranking the radio, instead of using batteries, is fun for about 2 days. Too much work for too little listening. I no longer bother and just buy AA batteries, which last a good long time.I like the strap on top for carrying it around. I like that the radio is durable (especially since it *will* be knocked over often).The light works OK, but there are better emergency lights (such as the fantastic Panasonic SQT555W601 Automatic Power-Failure Light)."
3,"Great power source, bad tuner","I would give this five stars for its hand-crank charging, which lasts for about an hour of ordinary radio listening. The charging mechanism is easy, not tiring, and, unlike other products in this category, not flimsy.I give it only three stars because the radio tuner is of low quality; in downtown NYC the FM dial only gets a few stations clearly and without interference."
5,A Must for your Emergency Preparedness Kit,This little gem will light your way and keep you in touch with news sources in the outside world during power outages or camping trips. Small and lightweight it is very easy to crank for a few moments and enjoy the reward of light & radio. Great gift for family & friends
5,"Emergency Preparedness - 3 Important Needs, One Small Radio","Though upon arrival, I had expected a larger Emergency Radio The Grundig FR200 did not disappoint for it's relatively moderate price the little lightweight radio contains some great features: A tiny built-in flashlight that sheds a fairly decent illumnation to find the kids; the pets a fuse or breaker box and find your shoes. 4 billion radio stations (Imagine, I could even listen to my AM news station with great clarity); a manual power crank to use alone or to charge an Ni-MH rechargable battery. Purchase the 4.5 V AC adapter, for this model or use 3 AA batteries. ((eton) Grundig has many models to suit your needs). FR 200 has an earphone jack, carrying case, instructions and limited warranty. Buy a few, or many for family, friends, keep in car basement, bedrooms, garage, bathroom, anywhere you may need a little extra security."
2,Hand cranked battery wears out WAY too soon,"I purchased mine directly from Grundig about two years ago (no Amazon connection.)As the last two reviewers note, the hand cranked battery worked well for awhile, but gave out after several months. ""Gave out"" now means a 1:1 ratio between hand crank time and listening time.I don't know about you, but only the ninth inning of a tight ball game can make me crank that much for so little airtime."
3,"Flawed, but decent value","A decent, but not great little shortwave radio for emergency or travel use.Good: Decent sensitivity. Accepts three sources of power - hand generation, AA batteries, or external power adapter. Has a built-in flashlight. Inexpensive.Bad: Annoying tendency to drift, no external antenna jack, you have to be careful where you put your fingers while tuning - it's very easy to touch the antenna and block the signal while cranking the generator.Bought mine used from a co-worker for $20 - I'd say that's about the right price."
2,Disappointed with performance,"No, the FR200 is not an expensive radio, but I expected more from any product Grundig was willing to put its brand name on. I bought this radio to have with me when I was working in the yard, fishing, etc. The problem is that it drifts off frequency so badly and in such a short period of time that I have to keep it nearby to keep adjusting it. I guess there is a lot of truth to the adage that you get what you pay for."
2,Not for emergency use,"The first time I used, or tried to use, this radio in a real emergency was Hurricane Irene. Oops... the rechargeable battery was dead, so the hand crank generator wouldn't charge the radio. Putting it away today, a brittle bit of metal broke and the antenna snapped off. This radio is not rugged or reliable enough for emergency use."
4,Good for the price,a very handy little radio that has all the basics. Takes up little space and has a very handy carrying case. A good buy!
2,"Mediocre quality, at best","I purchased an identical unit at Radio Shack a few years ago. It hasn't been more than 2-3 years and recently my husband was cranking up the handle and it literally broke off in his hands. The antenna end snapped off about six months ago, and the reception is adequate but not great. He went back to Radio Shack looking for a similar product and looked at a higher-end Grundig, asking the saleswoman about the quality of the product. As they were talking, a knob came off the radio, to her embarrassment. Needless to say, we will not be purchasing another Grundig shortwave radio."
2,crank handle broke off after 3 months!,"I was pretty happy with this radio for the last 3 months(i recently moved to Liberia, West Africa and needed something that didn't require electricity) until today, when the crank handle cracked off in my hand while i was cranking it! I wish i could post a photo here. They didn't design this device to withstand normal use! They should have made the handle out of metal or at least some kind of plastic that wouldn't break!"
2,Not Very happy with Purchase,"The sound from the radio is really harsh, even on FM! I'd expect harsh sound from shortwave. Used it during extensive power outage (Couple of days) and could not stand listening for more than a minute. Gave it up in favor of a RadioShack clock radio with a 9volt transitor battery backup. The self charging hand crank is a great idea, but why not marry it to something one can actually listen too? Would be appropriate for a doomsday emergency kit for Hurricane Katrina type disasters; but only if something better sounding can't be found."
3,Pretty basic info,"I've lived in the Tampa Bay for about 5 years and this book didn't have any suggestions that I hadn't already discovered on my own. I consider myself a pretty average individual, so if I didn't learn anything new then the information in this book is pretty easily discovered by anyone. I wouldn't give it as a gift which is my ultimate test of whether a purchase is worth the money."
3,Banbarra in the House!,"Many of these tracks can be found on many other soul/funk compilations, but...this CD is worth it just for the ORIGINAL version of SHACK UP by the mighty BANBARRA - of course, this song was later covered by A CERTAIN RATIO and BIS and others, but no one can touch the sheer downlow funk of the original, which could be the funkiest song ever recorded. Thing I'm wrong? Check, check, check Banbarra OUT!"
4,"Good pictures, sturdy, resource for homeschooling","I give this book a 4 star for being sturdy for kids and having good photos. It has a lot of labeling of parts. Hoping my kids grow into this one more. Using it as another book to reference and for the kids to hold along with homeschooling curriculae, Anatomy, Apologia Science."
5,Great pictures,I bought this book for my five year old to give her a reference about the human body. She loves the pictures and asks about everything she sees. This is a great way to educate your child about his/her body and answer some questions (where does food go after we eat it?).
1,"Parents, Be Aware",I would have given this book 5 stars but it has full female nude photographs in the sections about the circulatory systems and nervous systems. There are also reproductive diagrams in the back of the book but they are not actual photographs. Other than those issues it is an excellent book but use with caution.
5,educative,"I learned a lot about the mormonry. It taught us that for us that truth cannot ever be where there was blood and crime, wheather in the mormons or the catholics. They cannot be the truth."
3,Informative but slanted,"An easy-to-read tome of information, but not the most balanced, and certainly not the most objective. Especially disappointing is a later chapter which ""shows"" how Mormonism is not Christian, by presenting a chart that compares ""proper"" (ie. Fundamentalist Protestant) Christian beliefs with Mormon ones. An unfortunately antagonistic addition to an otherwise scholarly and informative work."
3,This is a non-fiction History book,"I purchased this book for lead-up writing material to the November 2012 election. I had purchased and studied it once before and was shocked and appalled by the possibility of a Mormon occuppying the White House. When there was one nominated, I was intent on documenting the main ideals of the cult-like belief system to readers. A hand injury in the important time leading up to the election. With the exception of some teasers in my blog, I was unable to satisfy the larger markets I was pursuing.I will not sell the book to another this time. It is an important reference piece for my bookshelf!"
2,AntiMormonism At its Worst,I have studied Mormonism over the past three years and was unfortunately disgruntled by this book. It is another book written to discourage people from exploring the great history of this Church. It list several documentations that are misinterpreted and misunderstood. This is not a new tool in the war on Mormonism. The documents found in this book are not virgin to me or any other member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. However it is a great book for Portestants who want to shun the Church and plant the seed of contention. However we do use this book in a Mormons Young Single Adults group to show the inconsitancies of what people think we really believe based on misinterpreted and misundersted verses that our Church believes.
2,Full of inaccuracies,"Authors use footnotes to to demonstrate their attention to detail and scholarship. In this case, the author gives his readers not only lots of footnotes, but also misquotes, and quotations out of context. Apparently he hopes that the readers will not ""check him out"".The book deals with a very controversial subject - the history of Mormonism, and this author is unabashed in taking one side, and no pretense at objectivity.There are better books out there. Save your money."
4,Well Done,"I think Richard Abanes did a good job on this book.He doesn't actually attack the LDS church,he simply presents some history,some facts and lets the reader draw their own conclusion.(well,maybe a little)Yes,he does bend away from being 'pro-Mormon',but I don't believe he is anti-Mormon either.I notice that some LDS will consider anything less than flattering to their to be anti-Mormon.The problem with this is that so few of them ever bother to do the research themselves to see if there is truth to what these writers are saying.When a writer indexes their sources in the bibliography,they do this in part so that any reader may check these resources for validation.Those who think that this or any other book is less than truthful should take the time to investigate.This is doubly important when it comes to things of a spiritual nature.I believe that LDs members would do well to look into his sources and not just pronounce it to be all lies.The truth will bear investigation."
1,"""One Nation Under Gods...""","Much of his so-called historical references (by a non-historian) are opinions of either non-members or, in the earliest journalistic references, people with axes to grind and probably even those associated with the murder of Joseph Smith and his brother Hyram. All I have to say is this is the same kind of criticism Jesus Christ himself took in a modern-day version. I'm sorry I had to even give this book one star."
1,Not Biased?,"This book is filled with half-truths and malphorisms (meaning the opposite of a euphemism). If anyone would actually like to learn about the Mormon Church from a non-biased point of view, I'd look for a different book. Perhaps the articles in US News and World Report or Time. Those are some good, non-biased articles and this is nothing like those."
1,Interesting Reading by a person that just joined the church,"Hello. I just joined the church and I preformed alot of reading both on books and the net for over 5 years. The book has truth to it. The intresting thing about ""history"" is that there is alot of ""mixed up"" media out there. Take for example the fact that Joseph Smith had been sealed to many wives. One source will say that the wives were married when another will say were not married. Alot of that kind of mixed information got me too look even closer into the church.If you look on page 171, epigraph it gives you the look of one quote but if you look back...its from three different sources and he compresses the quotes to make it look...interesting in his eye."
1,You might want to check the sources used...,"After reading the glowing reviews, I decided to do research into some of the material quoted by the author. I can only conclude that I am the only one on these pages to do so! Rarely will you find a book that takes so much liberty with history. Self-righteous Evangelical Christians with an axe to grind against the LDS Church will certainly embrace this work, but reasonable readers who do their own research will shake their heads in disgust. To understand where many ""Facts"" in the book collapse, I suggest doing your own research. Every reader should carefully evaluate the material in this book by checking the sources in full context."
5,Leaving the Church,"I am a Mormon, but I don't think I will be one for very long. I have been doing my own research into the history of the LDS church for several years now, and can assure readers that everything Abanes says in this volume is true. I have personally looked through many of the documents he used, although certainly not all of them by any means, and he accurately represents their contents.And despite my own investigation, which has been very deep, Abanes was still able to furnish several bits of data I never knew-- those missing pieces I could not find on my own.My heart is heavy, but my mind and soul have been enlightened. It's time to move on, and I encourage other Latter-day Saints to do the same thing. Abanes' book is a great place to start learning the truth. It contains no sarcasm, no anti-Mormon comments, no nasty tone so often present in books about the church. The tone is respectful, fair, and true.I quote one of my favorite shows: ""The truth is out there."""
3,"So, so book--better if taken as part of the trilogy.","Battlemechs CANNOT knock each other over by doing a running forward handstand into a flip. Nor can they roll around on the ground clenching each other like lovers.Delrio obviously didn't research his topic.Other than the glaring lack of knowledge of the game universe that this series is based on, I felt that the book was okay. It worked as part of the larger trilogy. Let the buyer decide whether or not they can suspend their disbelief."
1,I wish I'd skipped this one.,"'Mechs do not function the way the author describes them. They can't wrestle. Warfare in general in the Mechwarrior universe is very different than described within the pages of this book. The author clearly has little knowledge of the subject, or chooses to ignore it.The plot was terrible, the betrayal was contrived to the point of not being believable.There are two main characters as well as a primary location, all with the same name: Tara. Either this was dictated by the toy manufacturer that the series is based upon, or this is the single worst bit of writing/editing I've ever seen.This book left me with a very sour taste for more of the Mechwarrior stories. I do hope this writer will not be allowed to hurt this liscense any further."
2,CHEAP...CHEAP...CHEAP!,These earrings look just like you bought them at the dollar store...or even worse! I can't even impagine paying full price.
5,The best cd I've got. And I've got 522...,"this cd has stayed on my cdplayer for tow weeks now without leaving it. it has played over and over again, like 5 times a day and instead of getting boring it gets better every time."
5,Good lyrics and a great sound,I am a personal fan of Weezer which made it especially easy to like The Rentals. They are a great combination of good lyrics and a sweet sound. Get this CD!!!!!!!!!!
4,Wow,"Like most others, I am a Weezer fan. However, despite Rivers obvious dominance and prominence in that band; I keyed in on Matt Sharp. He's just the coolest bass player.. even if he never really does anything impressive.Besides his standout role in Weezer, what makes Matt even more incredible is that he can make an album like this. While there is certainly some Weezer influence, overall, Return of the Rentals is unlike any other album I've ever heard. Maybe I'm not cultured enough, but it's such a unique sound to me. Alt-Rock with crazy Moogs, it's cool, who'd a thunk it!?The only downside of this CD, as with all of Matt's other efforts is the fact that he's just not that great a singer. With Cheri (or Rivers) backing him up, he sounds good; but when it comes down to it, he'd get laughed out of American Idol, and probably most singer auditions too. Nevertheless, this first out-of-Weezer experience is awesome, and still stands as his best such effort to date."
5,Just like I rember!,"This CD died on me a few years ago, and I can say that these catchy tunes keep running through my mind. I am VERY glad I bought it again."
5,Brilliant!!,"This record is great!! If you are a fan of Weezer's first two records, you will love this record. The moogs and Petra Haden take this 4 star very good collection of songs into a 5 star masterpiece."
3,Weezette,3 1/2Endearing side project debut which benefited from the unique moog/male-female/rock dynamic quickly sputtered out after they initially returned.
5,#1 all-time,Out of all the albums I've ever heard this is by far the greatest album I've ever heard. It's a personal preference but I can think of no album where eight years later I am still playing it as if it were brand new. The 2nd album was a HUGE letdown but this album will always stand the test of time. SIMPLY AMAZING!!!
3,i'm giving this a 3 cuz everyone else is being too nice,"so...what is this? it is insubstantial-yet-fun music. it is way better than (now) weezer, it is way worse than (then) weezer. it is for listening to in cars with people who liked it back when it was released. it is a memory jog. it is fun for the first month, ecstatically so. it is very low-scoring in the category of sustained listening. it is the blue album sans genius, plus moogs. that's what it is."
2,Review for Ave Maria Album (Schubert),Didnt really get what i was looking for. Was hoping I would hear the version from Mozart. Had a whole lot of Ave Maria versions but Mozart wasn't included. Not so impressed.
5,Deep and Holy Divine Mother,One of the best I have heard a variation of Ave Maria. I had been looking for and Ave Maria Album. This filled all my need the different vertions. Deep and Holy Divine Mother. Thank you Great.Sincerely.A Friend
3,Ave Maria,"Some very good renditions of various versions, but some were rerecordings and not remastered, so were grainy and sounded like old 33.3 RPM recordings. I was disapppointed in those, but most were excellent for my purpose in becoming familiar with the music."
5,Superb,"There is a fifty page short summery of the journal that is very good. Next follows the journal which I understand is very close to the original manuscript. If you do not spell bears - 'bairs' - you do not know what you are missing. I wrote a Marine Corps slogan in the vocabulary of the journals. The feiw, The prowd, The mareens! Actually more phoenetically correct."
5,good support from Lynco,HAVE USE THEM FOR SEVERAL YEARS and have several pairs to change between the different pairs of shoes I have.
3,Okay product.,"Product is much more flimsy and shorter than I imagined. Serves its purpose. Overall, a fair product, but a little pricey for what you get."
4,gets the job done,"No surprises -- works great for satellite speakers. Note the 7 pound recommended maximum speaker weight. Package came with all the necessary parts and setup was a breeze. Nice that it comes with two types of mounting brackets: flat plate and L-shape. Only reasons these stands don't get 5 stars are that the shaft will only fit high gauge / low thickness wire, and I'm not a total fan of the adjustable mechanism that maintains the height even though it works fine. Again, they'll work great as long as your speakers are small satellites."
2,"Lot's of thinking, no actual romance","Where was the romance? The characters didn't even really know each other. Don't get me wrong, there was action but little romance. There was little communicating, just a lot of thinking. By the end, one has to wonder how the two of them fell in love when they barely knew each other. I gave it 2 stars because it wasn't boring but had action. There wasn't much of a romance in the story."
2,"And it went on, and on and on............. ugh!!!","This book had an interesting enough story line, but I found that the way it was delivered was lacking. I found the writing boring and it did not quite grip me. I found the characters where lacking and that some of their relationships where a bit far fetched and unbelievable.I give it two stars only because the concept of the story was interesting and some of the action scenes where good allowing me to actually finish the book. I won't be rushing out to pick up another book by Lisa Jackson any time soon."
2,2.5 stars,"The heroine helps the hero escape from her father who's just killed the hero's father--they're both young. She asks him to take her with him. He doesn't, but he does take a sapphire ring that's said to be cursed.Years later, they meet again when she stows away on his ship, running away because she killed her husband on their wedding night.There's a lot going on--an evil stepmother, hidden parentage, feuding families, but it's a lot of busy-ness without much point.And the heroine is the type for which idiotic defiance is confused with strength. I really started hating her when she was ""asserting her independence"" by insisting she could wander around freely on a ship full of men of questionable backgrounds who hadn't seen a woman in months. It's just tedious."
1,dark sapphire,"Lisa Jackson writes about characters and relasionships and thoughts and feelings that are so out of the story. These characters never even have time to get to know one another, and their emotions are all bouncing off the walls in such corny ways. Using too many describing words even for the littlest quiet scenes. I call this OVERKILL in the biggest way."
5,Brilliant and useful,Siblings is a brilliant psychoanalytic study of lateral relationships and sibling dynamics. I've found it to be very useful as a writer and critic interested in the workings of aggression. Even groundbreaking.
1,"This is not GIT, the great 80's rock band from Argentina !","Well, as many other Latinamerican Amazon buyers will find, this is not the band originally formed by Pablo Guyot, Willy Iturri and Alfredo Toth. According to Wikipedia, there are 5 discs from GIT:G.I.T. (1984)G.I.T. (El Album Negro) (1985)G.I.T. 3 (1986)Primera Sangre (1988)Distorsión (1992)Also there are compilations like Aire de Todos, Oro or Clasico that you can find on Amazon."
4,Lexar Digital Film Reader,"I bought this product because my Boss has a Canon Power Shot A50, and I bought for my wife a Fuji Fine pix 1400. The serial connection for digital cameras are very slow and consume batteries.I wanted a USB digital film reader and this one worked perfect out of the box. I plug it in the USB port (it comes with it's own USB cable)and ran the setup program on the Product's CD and after 2 reboots, one for the USB device on the mother board and one for the Lexar digital film reader it work fine. It shows up in Explorer as a removable Disk (F:) and Removable Disk (G:). The device has two slots for different type of digital film. The top slot has a PC Card Adapter which I use for the Canon Digital Film. The bottom slot I use for Smart media film for the Fuji Camera.Just click and drag the images off the digital film as if it was another drive on the computer. Could not be any easier."
1,Forget it.,"Following the purchase of a digital camera I went and picked up this sorry excuse of a card reader for my Macintosh Computer (an upgraded Beige G3 using system 9.x). While it did display the first few test shots on the camera with a 64mb Compact Flash card, it would not see any further than #83 (out of 106 shots!) and proclaimed the card was damaged. It wasn't- I had to get the pictures off via the camera's port. Combined with the PCMIA card you have to stick the Compact Flash Card into for it to read the pictures off of, it is a poorly executed design for such a pricey gadget.Needless to say I returned it promptly.If you are a new Mac user, go and get the VST Tri-Media reader- it works fine and gets you a floppy disk drive in the deal."
1,Product and Support Lacking Deeply,"I purchased this reader in hopes of reading my CompactFlash cards. I installed it and was able to read the card, however my computer would not restart. ""kebugcheckex...System Halted"" is not a good thing. After using Lexar's live support system I decided to download a new driver. Unfortunately the system was halted again. Another round with their unknowledgeable live support didn't solve the problem. Their solution is always the driver. However, when the driver is at fault, there's really not much you can do except return the item.I purchased a SanDisk ImageMate and love it. No problems, no lockups, and no conflicts. It works flawlessly."
1,Can not read Smart Media,"Recently, I Purchased a Lexar Digital Film Reader Model # GS-UFD-20SA-TP........ RW007-001. I had a conversation with Lexar Technical Support about my readers inability to read Smart Media Digital Film Cards and Crash my PC. This conversation resulted in the following E-mail from him to me.This solution did not work -- even after trying muliple times and returning the Digital Film Reader for another one and trying again. Since then I have replyed with two e-mail asking for help -- see below. There has not been a reply for 3 weeks."
4,Good enough but [costs some money],I bought this product one year ago and it didn`t bring any Windows xp drivers. I couldn`t find it on the lexar website so I contacted their support service wich promptly sent me the link for download. After downloading and installing the new drivers it worked fine ever since in 4 different machines with Cf of 16 and 64mb and a 16mb smartmedia.
3,"Decent, but not without problems.","I bought this reader a few months ago to transfer images from a 128 MB SmartMedia card. I picked this one specifically because I expected to need support for both SmartMedia and CompactFlash. I was disappointed by the lack of Linux support, but I managed to find a Windows 2000 machine and transfer the images from the SmartMedia card, and it worked fine.Jump ahead a few months. I tried to use it last night with a 16 MB CompactFlash card, the one that came with my new Canon S40. It failed miserably. Not one single image was transferred correctly. The only good to come of the experience was that I learned that there is native Linux support for the Canon S40, so I have no need of a separate reader.I still have several friends and relatives who use SmartMedia cameras, so I may keep this reader around for when I'm working with their memory cards, but I'm rather irritated with it at the moment."
2,Bait & Switch!!,"Product ad states 64 pods but they only shipped 16! When I called all they would refund was shipping, then I complained and they said $8 refund. So I asked for a return shipping lable and FULL refund. The CSR Amy was kind but her options from J&R were unacceptable."
1,"History of HONDA, not NSX","In this 50 minute video, the word Acura is not mentioned until 40 minutes into it and the NSX comes up when there are less than 7 minutes left! It's really the history of Honda. It starts when Mr. Honda was an auto mechanic and goes through the history of him starting with creating motorized bicycles through the introduction of the Honda Civic. It's only in the last few minutes that there is any mention of the NSX. I was amazed that they had the nerve to include NSX in the title of this video. If you want the history of honda, then it's not a bad video, if you want inside NSX info, you will be very disappointed."
5,THE QUEEN OF POP NEVER DISAPPOINTS,MADONNA MADONNA I love her and her Music this is a great album great compilation of sweet and mellow songs if you like Madonna you should own this album.
4,Really Worth Remembering,"Madonna is best known for her catchy dance tunes, but to dismiss her ballads is to dismiss a great portion of her career. ""Live to Tell,"" ""You'll See,"" ""Take a Bow,"" and ""This Used to Be My Playground"" are only a few examples of songs that showcase Madonna at her most powerful and most vulnerable (a juxtaposition that no one plays as well as Madonna). As an album (and unlike other Madonna compilations such as GHV2) this project works beautifully. The songs are pulled from all across Madonna's sprawling career, and yet the end result is a touching and unobtrusive reminder of the power of Madonna's softer side. This one really is something worth remembering."
5,Madonna does more than dance!,"This collection of sweet ballads shows Madonna's versatility as an artist with a refreshing change from her great dance pieces. From the timeless ""Take a Bow"" to the richness of ""Rain"", this CD is sure to please Madonna's most hardcore fan."
4,The Ballads,"This is a collection of Madonna's best ballads. There are 10 of her ballad hits, and some new tracks. I think that her version of Marvin Gaye's ""I Want You"" is the best cover song she's ever done. The video clip is good too, very rarely seen but it's beautiful. She also updates ""Love Don't Live Here Anymore"", which was originally from her 1984 album LIKE A VIRGIN. The new version is nice I guess. The other new song is a David Foster ballad, the acoustic ""One More Chance"", which shows off her vocals a little more. This album obviously was released to try to recoup some of her fans she lost over the EROTICA and Sex Book projects, perhaps reminding people why they loved Madonna. ""You'll See"" is an excellent ballad, another new song. Then you have other ballads like ""Oh Father"", ""Rain"", ""This Used To Be My Playground"", ""Live To Tell"", ""I'll Remember"", ""Forbidden Love"", ""Something To Remember"" and more. Overall a nice collection of ballads from Madonna."
4,Heliotropism,"A strong collection of Madonna's ballads and film songs. A re-make of Marvin Gaye's I Want You, with Massive Attack, is a good mix of beats and whispers. I'll Remember, Take a Bow, You'll See and Live to Tell are my favorites. Pretty Versnatchy dress on the cover."
3,Mixed Bag,"There are some real gems in this collection (""One More Chance"" and ""This Used to be My Playground""), but there are some songs that just don't fit within the overall theme (the first remix of ""I Want You""). Overall, it's worth it, but I'm still looking for the definitive collection of Madonna Louise Ciccone's music."
4,"Good, but could have been better","Great collection of songs but ""Bad Girl"" and ""Justify My Love"" should have definitely been included. I could have done without ""Crazy for You"" and ""Oh Father"". I don't think they really fit and other choices would have been better. Otherwise, ""I Want You"" and ""Love Don't Live Here Anymore"", as well as ""You'll See"" are great. I personally like a lot of the Erotica album songs such as Fever, Erotica and Bad Girl."
5,Madonna's 3rd best album.,"Only Madonna's Immaculate Collection and Ray of Light surpassed this album. I liked the song ""You'll see."""
4,Very Good!,I just thought that this Cd is one of the best combinations of Madonna's work. Keep up the good work!
2,"Boring, Yawn-Inducing","This album is a collection of ballads, and Madonna's ballads have always been very boring. This album has absolutely no energy at all. ""Take a Bow,"" ""I'll Remember,"" and ""Crazy for You"" are the only ones I thought were any good. You can find those on other albums, so this one was unnecessary for me."
2,this is a yawn of an album,"If you are a true Madonna fan, then DON'T buy this album. It includes all of the ballads that she released ever since her debut in 1982. The only songs that are listenable are the ballads that she released as singles in the 1980's (Crazy For You and Live To Tell). ""This Used To Be My Playground"" is also a great song. However, the album mostly has songs that are from the mid 1990s, which I thought was a very slow time for Madonna's music.I prefer Madonna's dance music. If you really like Madonna, then I recommend either ""Music"" or ""The Immaculate Collection""."
5,NOT TO BE SNIFFED AT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Madonna has come from singing in back street dives to major mega stardom, she knows what she wants and she's not afraid to pursue it no matter who tries to stand in her way. Listening to this CD shows that there is a softer gentler side to this woman and I personally love this album, it's the kind of album you listen to when you want to relax and put your feet up. So come on Maddie lets see more of this side of you."
5,good ballad collection,I'm not a huge fan of Madonna but I do love her ballads. This album - Something To Remember - contains her most popular ballads from the late 80s and early 90s. Definitely worth purchasing.Tag: greatest hits
4,All the best ballads,"... Her pop savvy is illustrated by a sixth sense when it comes to working with the best people - especially songwriters. I wouldn't call myself a Madonna fan, but she always does great ballads, and the best ones are all here. 'This Used to be my Playground', 'I Remember' and 'Live to Tell' are examples of classy, sophisticated songwriting and a crisp production. With the exception of her cover version of 'Love Don't Live Here Anymore', 'Something to Remember' is a great compilation of sophisticated ballads spanning the whole of Madonna's career from the mid-80s to today. A great gift for just about anyone."
5,Realistic View of the Inside,This book is a realistic portrayal of what an inmate experiences. One is taken inside Alcatraz and you feel as though you are there. A gripping read that is hard to put down.
5,Excellant Book.,"Whitey Thompson does an excellant job of taking you through his life and the time he spent on ""The Rock"". This book is a must read for anyone with the least bit of interest in Alcatraz."
4,I couldn't put it down.,"The book has been published in a raw style, with little editing. It is truly in the words of the writer, and it is a fascinating account of a unique life. He guides the reader through the abusive household he grew up in to the petty crimes that led him to become a ""career criminal"" and on through his days in lesser prisons prior to discussing Alcatraz. I highly recommend it. It's a real page-turner."
2,Poorly written and fairly unaccomplished memoirs.,"Educated readers should not be fooled by the above reviews.What looked to be a promising read soon turned out to be far from it. Appart from being very poorly written and repetative one actually learns very little about Alcatraz or indeed the men that were incarcerated there. Basically nothing of any real interest is recounted, and what is, is retold so badly as to be barely worth reading. A very poor book that in no way lives up to the billing that the above reviews suggest."
4,good enough,"I really like this pond heater. It does exactly what it said it would. We have a small pond (about 50 gallons) and this is the perfect sized heater to keep a hole in the ice. The only drawback is that during extremely heavy snows, the heater gets covered completely so you have to go out and dig a hole in the snow above it. Otherwise, its a great product for a small pond."
3,Haven't Read the Book Yet,"Question (with A Bit of Background) After reading through 1000 PLateaus and such and Delanda's interpretation Of Deleuze and Guattari, do you folks ever get ""scared"" that The BwO is just some reified Geist made to do perverse sodomite things and that Deleuze is on his way to becoming the 21 century Hegel? MY GOD!! What will Deleuze's Marx Be Like!?I will check this book out, bad Reviews or no"
3,"Elton takes on Earth's ecological meltdown, with mixed results","'Stark' is one of Ben Elton's earlier, and weaker, literary efforts. While his staunch pro-environmental/anti-establishment beliefs are commendable, he seems to force feed these ideals into a slapstick novel that manages only to be mildly humorous and ultimately rather ordinary. In 'Stark' planet Earth is a mess, on the verge of total ecological meltdown due to human mismanagement. Mankind's mega-rich elite have realized this for some time and have decided to build rockets to the moon to start human civilization all over again. Yet there is an improbable bunch of characters out to divulge and halt this plot. Silly? Yes. But slivers of dialogue are quite funny, and the wacky Australian characters are certainly memorable (..the rocket launch site is in the Western Australian boonies).Bottom line: a so-so early effort by Elton. I suggest reading his later works, starting with 'Popcorn'."
5,Stark was made into a movie!,Directed by the wonderful Nadia Tass & filmed by her talented husband David Parker this fabulous book was made into a major television series in Australia!Having seen Popcorn on the stage and listened to the hilarious Gridlock and masochistic Inconceivable on tape I couldn't wait to read STARK - from the start it was exciting and easy to read. The plot almost believable (I had to check some facts via Google whilst reading it to convince myself it was only fiction). The description of Western Australia's outback is very realistic. I can't wait to check out his other work. Ben Elton has a knack for making one investigate the ordinary and discover the other sometimes darker humourous side. Contrary to other reviews the number of characters is appropriate to the story. Its very clever and perfectly contained.
4,Quite humourous.,"Occasionally, the thrill of expressive poetic literature gets old, and I simply long to pick up the most illogical book, just because.And so, I was recommended this piece by the King of Illogical book fans, and so embarked on my first journey into the world of Ben Elton, which shall more than likely be followed by many more such journeys.I am grateful for my friend, however if there is one book which has a statement, it is this seemingly funny novel. It's message; money doesn't buy everything, particularly the world, and the environment is distingrating at an alarming rate. Also, that using camels to save the world is no simple task.It is not perfect, spans on way along the same line and ends in a bad way, yet it is well worth reading because it balances the important and the absurd, the riduculously humourous."
2,GREAT STORY BUT THE WORST ENDING EVER!!,"I Remember reading this in the summer of 1990 and loved it and the character in it... Until the end. Without a doubt one of the most horrible, worst written endings in the history of literature. Elton possitively RUINS this book with the most pandering self-righteous preachy ending in modern time. Talk about giving your reader/audience ZERO credit for understanding underlying sub-text. Elton takes his fans for morons with this one at the expense of an otherwise well written novel.Take my advice and stick to His Black Adder & Red Dwarf work, because this book will make you want to go out and beat some small british man with glasses to a pulp for insulting your intelligence."
4,Great boat toy for retriever,This is a fantastic little floatie toy but I do wish it held up better to hard chewing. We have the black extreme kongs for regular chewing but they don't float.
4,Endless Fun by Land or Water,"Pros: This is a great toy. Our golden retriever could chase it forever. It's great in a lake, pond, beach (be careful of waves) or also in a field. It never had a problem floating. The rope allows you to throw it a good distance.Cons: Our dog chews through the rope if unsupervised. It doesn't last long if she gets to it and chews it. So...we put it away when we're not using it. Problem solved.Beat dog toy ever! This is her favorite toy by far!"
2,Not for the water loving pit bull,"I had high hopes for this item as my two pits love the pool and jumping in after a floater ball or toy. Having multiple kong toys I figured this might last a while compared to the 3 minutes a tennis ball or similar lasts, well that's a yes and no. It lasted a whole 2 days, the rope minutes. :(They took the first rung off the aqua kong the first day, and the second day they got to the foam and the kong died.In full disclosure the offending pit loves to get to the middle of all his toys. And I believe the foam was too tempting a prize.I would still recommend this toy, but if your dog loves to chew toys and is large be ware. Not even the mighty Kong can stand to Conan the librarian.GG."
3,KONG Aqua Dog Toy,"Great toy - lab loved it, til it got lost in the lake. Didn't float that great, only got to play with it for a few fetches. Disappointing."
2,Fluff,"I'm not sure what to say about this book other than ""look elsewhere for knowledge"". The author really wanted the reader to know how great the new ASP.NET 2.0 platform is but there weren't any details in his explanations. It's like reading a really long advertisement for ASP.NET 2.0 that never pays off. Dino seemed very infatuated with his understanding of the platform and it's capabilities but somehow failed to curtail his ego long enough to do any real technical writing. I've read terse and boring tech stuff and this is the complete opposite, just fluff. It's just one long promise with no follow through.I'm sticking with O'Reilly publications."
3,a communion rite,"I read Euripides' original The Bakkhai, and I found Soyinka's version to be a pretty faithful adaptation of it. Soyinka's Bacchae was written as an African-influence stage play, and though I never saw it performed I think it would work wonderfully. I would recommend this play for anyone interested in either the Classics, or just Greek/Roman tragedies in general."
2,Poor Graphics and Illustrations.,The book did not have enough illustrations typical of the Grimm Brothers stories. I also thought that most of the illustrations did not capture the excitement of the story.
4,Another Vogt,"This novel has some totally bogus description on the back about aliens controlling humans, which isn't what happens in this book at all. This book is actually about people who can regrow limbs and come back to life, but at the price of their memory. I can't tell any more without ruining the story."
2,only hit: my love is the sh...,"Unfortunately ""My love is the Sh..."" is the only outstanding song for SFP. The rest is in the same style - even the earlier stuff - but not with as much hit potential"
4,"An Excellent Book, even if you're not into anthropology","This is an excellent ethnography about the Wayapi people who live in the Amazon rainforest. It is full of detail and eye-opening insight into their way of life and the effect deforestation and modern industry are having on them.For me, its main strength was the way in which it was written. Unlike many ethnographies, it never became dry or long-winded, but Cambell's descriptions are evocative and the characters are very real. This not only makes it a pleasure to read, but means you are actually caught up in their lives rather than scientifically observing; after all, these people are living and dying in Brazil right now."
5,SIMPLE RECIPES,"Jay Solomon's 150 Vegan favourites is an easy to follow recipe book with recipes that taste amazing!I would advise to lower the amount of either curry paste ( whew hot!) or the amount of chiles required.... a little too spicy for us. The recipes are flavourful and you do not require ""never to be found"" ingredients. I am so happy I have this recipe book in my collection as I know I can rely on it for great tasting vegan recipes."
5,Also good for allergies,"I am not a vegan, but I am nursing my 7-month-old who is allergic to dairy, soy, eggs and nuts. This cookbook is full of nutricious, tasty and exciting meals I can actually eat. I would recommend this book to anyone--independent of their dietary needs."
5,Vegan cooking for everyone,"This is the perfect cookbook for anyone who has limited time to cook and wants to cut back on the meat in their diet. The recipes have enough ingredients to be interesting--most taste really good--but are simple enough to make in a short time from start to finish. The cooking time for almost all the recipes is just a few minutes, so they are perfect for weekday evenings. For those who still want meat, these dishes make great, filling, and nutritious side dishes. With only two people, we always have enough leftovers for another meal."
3,simple,"These recipes are fairly simple, but may not be detailed enough if you're brand new to the kitchen. The ingredients are common and easy to find. This simplifies your shopping, but does lead to some repetition among the recipes. The dishes I have tried have been tasty and satisfying. Unfortunately, there is no nutrition information given.A cookbook I use a lot more is ""The Mediterranean Vegan Kitchen"" by Donna Klein."
3,"150 Vegan Favorites: Fresh, Easy, and Incredibly Delicious Recipes You...",When will someone rite a cookbook that will have ingredients that you can purchase in a grocery store and not have to go to a health food store?
2,Deedee,I collect vegan cookbooks and like to read them for fun. This is one that I wish was not a part of my collection. The recipes sound unappealing and taste as they sound. There are much better cookbooks.
1,bland,"If you want a good vegan book that has interesting and tasty, easy recipies, try HOW IT ALL VEGAN. If you want a good vegan book with amazing and mouth watering but often somewhat complicated recipies, try THE VOLUPTUOUS VEGAN. 150 Vegan Favorites, on the other hand is not worth buying. Most recipies in it taste the same; they are bland and boring. They seem to be for people who want to eat healthy but don't care if their food is flavorful."
2,Bland and Boring,"If you like your food bland and boring this is the book for you! Seriously, it might be of value to someone who is a beginning cook and wants very simple recipes. I don't want to be harsh but I'd call this cafeteria vegan cooking."
2,Better vegan cookbooks available,"I recommend this cookbook in my book ""Creationist Diet."" I do as my book includes a chapter on ""The Benefits of a Vegan Diet."" But since following a vegan diet can be rather ""strange"" to many people, those desiring to follow such a diet need ideas on just what to eat and how to prepare it.However, as I tried using this cookbook more after my book was published, I didn't find it as helpful as I thought it would be. The recipes simply are not that appealing. I've made a few of the beans recipes, but that's about it. I've found other vegan cookbooks to be more helpful, such as ""Simply Vegan"" and ""20 Minutes to Dinner.""So if I ever publish a new edition of my ""Creationist Diet"" book, I'll probably omit the recommendation for this cookbook and substitute both of these other ones."
5,Does everything it said it does.,"Had the recorder for a couple of months now and it works great. I have tried using Maxwell DVD-RW and TDK DVD-R (8X) and didn't have any problems. The DVD-R works in all of my other DVD players including the one in my car. Love the fact that it has a feature to automatically figures out the best quality to record a movie over 2hrs into one DVD. Using the time recorder with my DirecTv programmable receiver, it works like a charm.Manual is somewhat useless and you will need a lot of trial and error to get it working to your liking. The dubbing process is somewhat slow ever at the high speed option. It took approx. 5 minutes to copy a two hour recording to a DVD. I was expecting it to be faster for a machine dedicated for this kind of process. Another drawback I found was I couldn't create more chapters or edit the content if I recorded it directly on the DVD instead of the HDD. Otherwise it is a great machine for the price (under $400) I paid for."
2,Changed my mind.,"After reading the review from ""T. Phoenix, decided that I do not want to purchase this unit due to it's black level bug issue.I also want to be able to play the discs from other players in my home.H. MORGANZA"
1,This could have been a great product,"I agree with the previous poster (jh_chen) about the black-level bug. This recorder would have been incredible, but with the black-level bug it is just not good. Yes, if you only play the DVDs you made in the same machine you will not have a problem. But what if you will want to replace the recorder in the future or want to share your recordings with others? The picture will look washed out, unless the DVD player has appropriate IRE adjustment options (not all do) and your friends of family know how to do that. With this Toshiba model you will be creating DVDs that you know will be ""off"". I can't believe Toshiba did this. Hopefully the next model will fix this. Once fixed, I would give this recorder 5 stars."
3,um.. 80 MEGABYTES??,"i think the webmaster or whoever wrote the description of this dvd recorder need to know a little about the difference between MB and GB... there is no way in world that you can record 109 hours on 80MB.. this site needs to go on the back page of pcmagazine bluffs =) well. anyways, considering this DVD recorder has 80.. GB! it's not a bad recorder and although it's a little pricey, i'm still gonna go ahead and give it a 3 stars. Hopefully, soon, they are gonna change that 80MB to 80GB.. Goodluck!!"
2,Torch it!,I am a big fan of Pattie Lupone but as a torch singer she has a long way to go to catch up to the likes of fellow singers Linda Eder and others. I was very disappointed in this CD.
1,Why oh why?,"I am still waiting for someone to explain to me how this woman, who can't act, can't sing, and can't even consistently hit the right notes is such a big deal. Really. The album is no better than her on stage performances in ""Sweeney Todd"" (in NY) or ""Anyone Can Whistle"" (at Ravinia) - and they were embarassing. There are so many gifted singers - why can't we celebrate them, instead?"
5,Natmama is a mess!,"Do NOT listen to Natmama's review. This CD is wondeful! It is easy to tell by the tone and phrasing of Natmama's review that this is simply a sad and bitter person, with little to no true knowledge of acting and singing talent/ability. Patti rocks!"
4,Just like real life,Spanish interns at radio station raise hellEscapades galoreNot bad + learn Spanish;)
5,Oshima makes Godzilla sound big,"Godzilla has had some really good theme music (I would be hard pressed to pick a favorite), but Oshima's is the one that most makes me think of the size of Godzilla. This is fit music for a giant monster! I do think this is the best Mechagodzilla theme music I have ever heard.If nothing else, the cover art is sweet."
4,"beautiful music, we love it",we had one before but we lost it or someone borrowed it. so we bought it again.
2,as far from the real thng as it gets,"I have seen other things written by Mr. Mortimer, and I would rate them somewhere between adequate and good. This book is niether. You have to hold your nose and swallow hard to say that a bryce user is much better off with the manual than with this book--which demonstrates hardly anything with it's amatuerish exmples and near useless lessons. I really flelt ripped-off in buying this book. It showed no insight into or mastery of the great product that Bryce is. It was if Mr. Mortimer played with Bryce for a couple of days and said to himself: ""I have a great idea, why not write a book."" In that respect it failed too. It was little more than a grotesque collection of pictures, and paint by the numbers. Please Mr. Mortimer, we don't mind you making a living, but next time earn it. Save your money."
1,"Sloppy, poorly edited, poorly written...","I'm quite disappointed, to say the least. I was expecting a book similar to Susan Kitchen's excellent book on Bryce 2, but this frankly doesn't deliver. The text has some- if few- useful ideas, but the rest of the book shows nothing new, and worse, nothing worth the excessive price. The CD itself is sloppily designed. The Materials folder had to be copied to my hard drive and the resources fixed so Bryce 3 would even recognize them; furthermore, there's a folder of very large pictures that are in the book anyway. Why weren't these made into smaller, untiled pictures? There's also a folder of peculiarly useless information on a video program where the documents are in a combination of Pagemaker and other formats. The whole project shows last minute frantic work, and the CD-Rom seems to be added just to raise the price. The best word to sum up this fiasco: disappointing."
2,Bate and Switch,"Despite the claims this was being sold as new, this book was used and missing the included CD. When purchased the dealer claimed this was a new book, yet upon receipt the book showed it was being used as a library book with notations throughout the book. The CD, which was supposed to be included, had been removed so access to additional resources is unavailable.The book itself is valuable, but the dealer lied by claiming this was a new book. It was used and as such should have been sold at a reduced price, which should have been reduced even further since the included CD had been removed.Sorry, but I cannot recommend this particular dealer and Amazon should reconsider their association with them.Again, I do view the book as a valuable resource. However, the dealer should have been honest in their description and appropriately reduced the price as a used book, without the CD resoruces."
1,The material in this book does not justify its excessive $$$,"If you are a Bryce fan then STAY AWAY from this book. R. Shamms Mortier is at best a mediocre artist and an even worse author. If you truly want a good Bryce book read ""Real World Bryce 2"" by Susan Kitchens. Most of the ideas discussed in that book can be carried over to Bryce 3D. Little to no info in the R. Shamms Mortier book is included on the deep texture editor so I would just avoid this book at all costs."
1,not a good bet...,"I have to start my review by saying that I'm not the biggest fan of Kai Krause programs. The non-standard interface and the ""just explore"" atitude of Metacreations irritates me so I have a bias. I was disappointed with this book because it provides no great insight beyond the so-so manual Metacreations includes with Bryce 3d. Examples in this books don't provide little insight into ""natural"" effects(or even stuff from Planetary Traveller) but instead spend a lot of time making levitating silver balls reflecting the environment. Cool effects in '85 on an Amiga 1000 but not now. I don't think it is worth the money."
4,Flop or Favourite,A very well thought out album with very good lyrics. Every song seems to tell a story. A treat for any Damage fan = )
4,5 years strong,"I've had my heater for 5 years now. I love it. In fact, I'm thinking about getting another one for the other end of the house. I purchased this heater to replace a 5 burner radiant heater from the same maker that went bad. I installed this model around 5 years ago in my living room and I haven't touched it since. I turn off the gas (Propane) for spring and summer and turn it back on come the fall. It starts and runs great every time.I like the digital thermostat compared to a number system on other stoves. My thermometer on the other side room stays close to the stoves digital read out.I don't use the timer feature because I can't keep the clock set right. I believe I have lost the ability to set the clock without unplugging it at 12:00 and plugging it back in. But it keeps great heat, kicking on and off for me with no problems. I love it."
3,Not as good as the first,"Of all the books Don Aslett has written about clutter, this one disappointed me the most. I was waiting for something that would inspire me to dejunk my life the way Clutter's Last Stand did. This was not the book. Lose 200 Pounds This Weekend is a kind of catalog of clutter. It divides clutter into various categories, sports clutter, paper clutter, etc, and suggests ways to get rid of them. It lists reasons to get rid of clutter, how it affects your life, and when to do it. If you are still wading through clutter, and need one more boost of energy, this might do it. However, I think rereading Clutter's Last Stand might be just as helpful."
2,Disappointing,"When I bought this book, I expected it to contain solid, well-planned-out instructions for spending a weekend decluttering my house. It doesn't. The book itself is a clutter of words strung together to fill up the book. As another reviewer said, it's a catalog of junk. There's this kind of junk and that kind of junk, and it's all bad, so get rid of it. Clutterbugs more than anyone else need specific, step-by-step advice for finding a pathway through the clutter. This book doesn't provide it."
2,It's just not the real thing,"Beautiful book, great recipes...except for one: the pizza dough recipe is nothing like what they use at the Chez Panisse Cafe. After several frustrating attempts to try and duplicate the pizzas that I have eaten so many times, I called the restaurant, and they admitted that the recipe in the book was not the real McCoy. Without it, what's the point? Side note: there is a pizza dough recipe in Rogers and Gray's The Cafe Cookbook that is much closer to the original..."
1,Unbiblical Trash,"Wake up people, read your bible if you want to know how to live. Don't waste your money on this nonsense. This kind of teaching ruins people and families. And they make all kinds of cash teaching their own brand of Christianity."
2,Fine If Man is a True Follower of Christ,"Christian men and women are to submit to the Lordship of Christ. When each does, sublimating their sinful desires to Christ's holy and pure will, the outcome is excellent.But only when each does.Otherwise, much abuse takes place under the guise of following a Biblical mandate."
1,Inadequate,"Although the authors of this little book promote an elegant and sheltered way of life for women, they do subtle damage to their own Christian presupposition that every creature is made for God; the operative and disturbing premise which these authors have embraced is that women are made for men.Furthermore, the authors allow little space or honor for daughters who seek to honor, follow, and obey femminist fathers and husbands."
1,good for the laughs,"Well-they are good writers, I'll give them that. But, sadly, they twist scripture to make God look like a sexist tyrant who created women to be slaves. This book's attitude harkens back to ancient Greece. If you happen to purchase it, it makes a good laugh for a dull day!"
5,Defending Noble Daughterhood!,"When you pick up this book and open up the pages, hold on to your seats! So Much More is full of controversial subjects for the Christian world today. Sadly this is true. One subject covered indeepth by Miss Anna Sophia and Elizabeth is that of the attack on womanhood and consequetnly daughterhood, feminism. Is there room for feminisim in the life of a Chritstian? If you have questions, the Botkin sisters have biblicaly sound answers. They defend what I believe to be the ture, God fearing meaning of daughterhood. Don't take my word for it you must buy, read and see for yourself if the Bible supports So Much More's given solutions."
5,tight,This album has amazing chord changes It wasnt heavy enough though for the day 1984.These guys were all accomplished jazz musicians which many people dont know.So its got good hooks but the players are better than what was recorded they thought they could get signed to a major label by writing toned down stuff.
3,"Has potential, but...","This has the potential to be a much-needed alternative to the classic introduction to Asian art by Lee, but the text is quite sketchy - it almost seems a write-up of LaPlante's lecture notes - and the illustrations are dreadful, certainly not anywhere close to the standards of contemporary art publishing. There are surprising gaps; there is no mention of Tori Busshi as the sculptor of the Shaka Triad at Horyu-ji, for example. Some line drawings are gawd-awful. With better editing and good pictures, this would be an excellent text."
3,Could be better,"To be honest for an art book to not contain color photographs is pretty weak. You're probably going to purchase this as a textbook - so just get it, otherwise I would look elsewhere."
3,"Great for DVD,CD labeling!!",Works great with the Casio Disc Title Printer buy tape does not last very long! Very expensive to use!!
2,average psychological study on a great topic,"In this psychological dissertation, a gay Latino researcher interviews ten Latinos about their process toward their acceptance of being gay. Garcia will be a great therapist for gay Latino men with concerns about their sexuality or race. Nevertheless, this text says nothing that Diaz, Anzaldua, and Almaguer haven't said before or better. The book divides into a review of the literature and then long quotes from the research subjects with not much else. Garcia posits that psychologists have not studied race and sexual orientation simultaneously enough; in that way this book is a good intervention. Otherwise, it is a little thin."
5,The Best Kind Of Mom,"I hope that you will be offering this book soon. I picked it up at a local book store because I liked the title. I just finished reading it last night. I have to tell you that of all the self help books and all the articles I have read on how to raise children, this little book changed my life. I can't believe there is so much information on how to be ""The Best Kind Of Mom"" in 38 pages. I can't wait to give this book to every Mom that I know. Thank You Joni for your wisdom and your insight. I know if you read this book you will feel the very same way. The guilt that I have felt over the years is slowing melting away. I actually feel lighter!!"
1,Translator's English knowledge makes it impossible to read,"I purchased the book as the contents promised a great overview of SAP SD processes.Unfortunately, the book was written in German and translated by somebody who does not speak good English nor knows SAP.This makes it virtually impossible to read it. Do not buy it!Just some examples:"" The data determined by the system however can for the concrete individual case be changed or supplemented""""In the scope of the scenario sale from stock to consignment taker the following R/3 components are to be integrated the best:SAP terminology knowledge gaps:""Sales path"" = Distribution Channel???""Sector"" = Division?Again, do not buy it!"
3,Two Great Tracks,"Not a great record, but not a bad one either. Nothing new on the arraingements with two standout exceptions- a beautiful string version of ""Kid"" and a revved up ""Brass In Pocket"". Worth it for those two."
3,cleaning comb broke within a week..,"I liked the fact that the bristles on the brush are all natural and that is why I bought it, I appreciate that sort of thing. It says it is large but I don't consider 2 1/4 inches wide to be large for a brush, perhaps that is just me though. The part on the cleaning comb that holds it in the brush broke within a week so now the cleaning comb falls out of the handle if I am not careful."
2,Does not stay on the gun,"I own a Beretta Xtrema 2 shotgun. I unscrewed the front bead, removed it from the shotgun and used the screws that came with the product to screw the product into the bead threads. The problem is the screw is too short. I had to use Loktite and Superglue to keep the product from loosening or coming off. After two hunting trips, the screw came loose and fell out. Eventually, the product just fell apart & had to be replaced. Although I really liked the sight picture, I was constantly wondering if it was getting loose or if I would lose it. I would not recommend this product!"
1,Pass on this one.,"I have read some wonderful Scottish stories, but this is not one of them. I wouldn't waste my time grinding through this one. The characters are wonderful but the story is poorly edited or written - very choppy. I would choose anything by Karen Marie Moning instead or My Scottish Summer. Save your money and your time -- pass on this one, I wish I would have."
1,"Looks Like a Moen, Doesn't Fit","The inserts are a perfect match replacement for the Moen Chateau one-lever show handle insert, but they are too loose and will not stay in the knob without application of cement or caulk which means that when it is time to clean the knob, the inserts must be pried out and thrown away. Good design for Danco, bad design for the consumer."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,"Anyone who says this book is good (although entitled to opinion) seems not to be a true rock and roll fan. Rolling Stone leaves out many important bands that made huge influences in Rock and Roll and include ones that are not even categorized as rock such as rapper Notorious B.I.G. or Tupac, Eminem and pop ""princesses"" like Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Destiny's Child and other similar entertainers. If you want a true idea of how un-rock and roll this book is just read the inside sleeve. It overloads you with pop bands and intersperses this list with two or three rock bands. It's a pretty accurate overview of the whole book: loaded with pop and short on the rock. This book is not worth a buck. It's also seriously outdated, about 5 years. It does not include pertinent information such as Layne Staley's (Alice in Chains) death or Dimebag's (Pantera) death, let alone his band- either of them (Pantera and Damageplan). It's a waste of your money. I would give it a zero if I could."
2,What would you expect?,Never took more than 5 minutes to get through a rolling stones magazine. So wasn't surprised when it took 15 minutes to go through this magazine. Rolling Stone always tried to over load us with B.S. Can see they're still going strong. Always good for under the cat box.
2,FAR from complete.,"I got this book for Christmas last year. Good resource for a lot of bands and musicians. So what's wrong?Where's Pantera?Where's Dream Theater?Those are the only two I can think of offhand. There is way, WAY too much vital stuff missing."
1,Not as good as its competitors,"This is a huge book with lots of bands and solo artists inside but many are not here. Where is Weird Al Yankovic, Ben Folds and others? This book does have some basic information on the bands contained such as when and where they formed, were signed etc, but nothing you probably don't know if you're already a fan. It is also missing albums such as for example Bon Jovi's One Wild Night Live album. This book is good maybe for school assignments if you are researching bands that you have no knowledge of but this book's competitors have much better information. There's also no index or contents page which makes finding who you're after take a bit longer. The paper the pages are written on is also fairly cheap ... feeling yellow looking white paper. If you want a book on this sort of thing try Q Rock Stars Encyclopedia and others. They're much better."
2,A disappointment,"This is clearly not the success they would like it to be. it is very incomplete and patchy. Some artists are covered too succintly and some should not be included in a rock encyclopedia. If you need one reference work, this is clearly not it. This is probably due to the direction that RS magazine has taken over the last decade or so. While it was indispensable reading it has become hopeless and out of touch. I really used to read it but the quality of the writing has gone down the drain and this is reflected here. It is surprising since the early editions of their album guide were quite fantastic."
1,Crappy as the new editions roll out,"I had to do a report for my music appreciation class and chose my most fav band in the world, White Lion. Luckily, the college library had the first edition because White Lion was deleted in the second edition (or revised edition). As a big music nerd (and liking to read rock bios), I rather have each edition they update to keep the old band's listing as musical reference, but they don't. There are other rock and roll reference books (some may be out of print already, especially if you're looking for a band that's obscure), and I got more info from other books than Rolling Stone."
3,Average read,"I think the RS Encyclopedia is a good overal reference, when it does indeed cover ROCK artists.As a glaring example,Its a shame RS deleted Material Issue from this last edition of the RollingStone Rock & Roll Encyclopedia in favor of such memorable ""rock"" actsas: Tony Orlando and Dawn, Amy Grant, Kid n Play, and Swamp Dogg (manwho could forget them??). Material Issue was a unique band and apioneer of modern pop-y rock or power pop music. Please, editors,listen to the new Millennium Collection or any ofMI's cd's and try to get a clue. I understand you must slim down yourvolume from time to time, but don't delete real (and legendary)rockbands in favor of schlock. I know Material Issue has not had anyalbums out recently, but the lead singer killed himself in 1996. RIPjim."
4,"Huge, huge book with every band you can think of listed!","I learned a lot about music history by browsing through this monster book. It helps to read the bios which include the top songs/albums of bands from the 60s which were before my time but still get a lot of coverage in the baby boomer press. Also, it's really fun to reminisce about one-hit wonders from the 80s that were played on MTV constantly. Good for anyone who is really into rock music. Few country artists are included, but some jazz/soul/R+B greats do make it in."
3,Informative but unbalanced,A good read with plenty of information. Unfortunately the information is unbalanced in terms of amount of print dedicated to certain artists. Ex: Eric Clapton gets only a few paragraphs while The Clash gets several pages ? Are you kidding me ? It should be just the opposite. As I said unbalanced.
4,Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll,"cool book with a lot of information!! ....like many things, everything in a ""book"" form can easily be out-dated but, for the information with the dates provided, GREAT BOOK!"
4,"Interesting, but not exactly what I expected","It was very informative, but did not include the updated info from the 1st Edition."
4,Not Dishwasher Safe!,Packaging says 'handwash' not dishwasher safe! Description needs to be updated. The knife is sharp and feels easy to work with though. It did stain a little after it sat in the sink overnight (accident!) but it appears that it is a decent purchase for the price. I've yet to find a decent knife that is dishwasher safe so it does not surprise me that this one is not either.
2,gross,"Cheap, flimsy, shiny crap. I'm sure it cuts but the feel is horrible, the blade looks like something you'd buy at Disney. Not happy. Light , weak, lame."
5,Handy knife,"I use this knife almost daily. Great for cutting and chopping veggies. I like the size better than a larger knife, it's easier to work with. This is a quality product, made in the USA! I have several other Rada knives and spreaders and I plan to buy more."
1,WRONG PICTURE! Rocky Point is a lighthouse kit!!!,"Please do not order this kit if you want the winter forest scene. ""Rocky Point"" is actually a lighthouse on a shore. Click on the customer provided photo to see what the actual kit looks like. I made the mistake of ordering this kit, thinking I was ordering the winter forest scene and was very disappointed to get the lighthouse, and am now trying to get a full refund and had to return the kit. Then I was told by Supermart that they did not have the winter scene kit in stock. I found it at Joanne's Fabrics and ordered from them instead. The winter scene kit is called ""All is calm"". I am also disappointed that although I brought it to the attention of Supermart that the wrong picture is displayed with this kit, they have not changed it yet."
1,"Bad battery, or just OLD camera?","I cannot say whether the problem was with these ""comparable"" replacement batteries, or with my 16 year old cam-corder. All I know is that, despite mutiple attempts, at charges, this battery did NOT provide power, to my cam-corder, and I mean AT ALL! My camera had NOT been turned on since 1998, and these batteries did NOT turn it on, even for a second. Was it my worn-out cam-corder? Or, was it the battery? No way to be certain. I threw it all out, not wanting to mess with it more than I had to."
5,Great!,"I was a little afraid to buy this battery, because it was cheap and I feared that it would not work. However, I have had no problems with this battery and I have used it a lot this Christmas season. This is a great battery at a great price."
4,happy,I received this very quick and so happy that i can now use my camera. thank you for your quickness.
1,Save Your Money-Won't hold charge,Purchased but did not use immediately. Went to use a couple of weeks later and will not hold charge. Only lasts about one minute and then dies. Contacted company said I had to return within 30 days and it was past the 30 days.
5,Very Pleased,Very pleased with the battery. I just charged it and works just as good as the first battery that came with the video camera. Fast delivery also. Great price.
2,not that good,"I bought this book on the other reviews, however this book is not that great. First of all it mentions all the obvious travel tips that every body knows. Then it just list a whole bunch websites where you can find cheap deals. I did that myself at home. If you want to save time surfing the internet for travel sites then this is the book for you."
2,"These are restaurants, not Bars!","Did they just steal their own restaurant reviews? MOst of the places in here are not really bars, they are restaurants. They must have been in a hurry to put this out. Zagat's top choices are pretty bad if you want go out and drink. Great if you want to eat at a top 10 restaurant though. Stick to what they know. Food surveys."
1,Save your money,This book could not have been very well researched. It looks more like an attempt to take your money from the money grubbing Zagats. How could this posible be published for New Yorkers.....
1,not worth it,"Very disappointed to find that this $20.00 chopper works no better (on onions, anyway, which is primarily what I use it for) than the $3.00 one I purchased at a chain dollar store. I was counting on the Oneida name, but this item was a bust."
1,Buy it if you want smooshed onions,it does not chop...it smooshes everything into a paste. it is a horribly designed product and should not be sold on amazon.
3,oneida chopper - so so,It chops nuts lickety split - fine on some veggies too - but how are you supposed to clean this sucker??
1,awful,"doesn't chop well, hard to clean, and you can't get the thing back together, You end up spending more time triing to get the thing to work than it would take to chop the stuff yourself."
2,Outdated,"I never did end up studying the whole book, only parts of if. Although first published in 1938, it obviously draws on much older material, from the time of the two British wars in Afghanistan in the mid-1800's.The phrase list at the end of the book thus had some wonderfully outdated, and now quite useless sentences such as ""My servant has the plague"" or ""Wrap your turban around your gun""."
5,Great read for bedtime!,My son is 1 yr old and we've been reading this together every night right before he goes to sleep since he was 2 months old. I dim the lights just enough to see the book and the little lights are very relaxing. I think he knows by just looking at the book that it's bedtime. I would recommend it and plan on buying Beetle Bugs Party by the same author....it also lights up!
5,Colorful and sturdy; educational fun,"I bought this book for my grandson, but it's a very popular book in my gallery, as well. It's a colorful, sturdy, and educational celebration of the season. Who could ask for more?"
1,Rip off,"I was under the impression this was a tire and rim combo, especially for the price. I can go to the boat shop down the road and get the tire and rim combo for $100. On the invoice they sent me it says the cost is $60.34 but for some reason I got charged $107."
3,An insightful call to moderation,"Fr Seraphim Rose's short text on Blessed Augustine is an insightful charge for Orthodox to embrace the tenets of moderation and understanding in an approach to the often controversial views of Augustine. While not an 'academic work' in the sense that it holds up to a great deal of critical scrutiny in all its points, Fr Rose's text nonetheless provides a much needed alternative to the frequent 'Augustine-bashing' found in certain circles, drawing out both the negative and the positive in the author's thought."
1,Picture is not what you get,"This is a single formed vent hose, not the overflow hose pictured. I did not do my homework to confirm that part number was what I need. It is exactly Motorcraft KM4566 water outlet hose but it looks nothing like what is pictured. Go to a Ford replacement parts website and type in this part number to see what you are really getting. The hoses for the 3.9L are complex with many different hoses and part numbers. Just do your homework before you spend your money and you will be fine."
3,Not bad,"This works fairly well and does not get gooey or sticky. Another thing I was impressed by is it doesn't really have a taste to it at all. However it also dries up very fast, and uses a very simple formula. That would be acceptable if it were cheaper than it is, but at the price there are better options."
2,not that good,"Expected more from this product. Was really disappointed that it did not last very long, had to keep reapplying. Even though it's supposed to be tasteless, you can definitely taste it. Will not buy this product again. Could have gone to the local drugstore and purchased a better product at a better price."
2,Not for me,"This lub is not for us, it is really not good for sexual play night, nor good for me when I'm alone. We have had much better and will not purchase this product again"
1,MAJOR LEAKS!!!,"I was so excited to find a coffee maker with the cup-at-a-time feature. My husband just loves the convenience. We had tried the Cuisinart, but it died in less than a year, and the Hamilton Beach looks cheesy for the price....I decided on this one and received it today. I tried 3 different brews and they all resulted in coffee or water all over my counter. It will be returned asap with replacement not an option!! I may have just received a lemon, but I can't recommend this coffee maker."
5,Best Book On The Counter Culture,"At 60 years of age, I came up through the whole phenomenon of the 60's/70's and it was a hoot. One of my hobbies is reading books about the era, partly from nostalgia, but also to gain a better perspective on a very important part of my life. Coyote's book is the best that I have read on the subject. He was in the very epicenter of what was happening and gives a riveting account of the scene. If you are interested in the subject, start here and after you have read a number of books on this topic, I think that you will agree with me. If there is a better book on the 60's, and I doubt that there is, I want to know about it."
4,An amazingly rational account of a very irrational time.,"""Sleeping Where I Fall"" is actor Peter Coyote's personal memoirs of the San Francisco hippie/commune scene of the late 60s and early 70s. I found this to be a very interesting and well written book. It seems Coyote took advantage of being in the right place at the right time and became a cutting edge member of the emerging counterculture. His detailed account recreates the era; from the newness and exuberance of the concept of ""free"" - to the interminable chaos and outrageousness of trying to live it. I think it would be of great interest to people who are sympathetic to the ideals that blossomed during this era."
5,It Wasn't Me,"I lived through the '60's, but on a different, more acceptable level....married to a student. I did, however, live in Vancouver's ""hippie district"", and had a half-hearted admiration for those who thumbed their noses at society's norms. This book gives me a better insight to the ideals and the guts to live those ideals the hippie culture evoked. Peter Coyote's book was honest, insightful and informative. He creates a feeling in the reader of having been in San Francisco and in the communes. I couldn't help but being impressed by his knowledge, abilities and his joy at being what he had been."
4,"well written, but an embarrasment to communardss everywhere","This was a well written book of an interesting time. Coyote's honesty was apparent but there is obviously a glamorous, boastful side to it that is not appealing to me. I lived through that time and had parallel adventures. His groups with their dependance on welfare and unemployment checks, their use of heroin and methamphetamines, and their absurd and adolescent macho posturing with guns gave the rest of us honest , hardworking counterculture types a bad name. It is no wonder there are so many victims strewn through the book and it is no wonder that they had so much trouble with neighbors. It was reassuring that he seemed to have learned some lessons from those times."
2,Too self-absorbed and showoffy.,"If he had written more about the world outside his little group of friends and lovers, Coyote could have had an interesting book. As it is, it's mainly a chronicle of living dirt poor and having as much sex as possible, while being surprised that your gorgeous blonde deer-hide tanning girlfriend somehow always catches you cheating. He makes the common mistake that the rest of us care how many women he slept with and under what circumstances. Memoirists be warned: What was most important to you is not what is most important to your readers. He spends relatively little time on much more interesting events such as the prosecution of the San Francisco mime troupe, and the famous people who came to their aid. In fact, he spends very little time on anyone else at all, except to point out that he knew or met them or somehow locate himself there. Disappointing book."
1,"A Boring Life, Yawns Included At No Extra Charge","This book is almost completely unreadable, a puff piece, really, navel-gazing by yet another grown child, raised in wealth and privilege, who turned his back on his family in order to drop out of society during the turbulence of the late 1960's.Peter Coyote's personal life story is nauseatingly boring, a life without any particular real angst or pain, a life in which one must import and manufacture angst and pain. One is reminded of Candice Bergen's autobiography Knock Wood, in which she admits that as a very young actress, a director tried to elicit some kind of sense memory within her, one of grief and loss, and she had nothing in her past upon which to draw upon the needed emotions. Coyote's life and self-realization in Standing Where I Fall just isn't very interesting, and beyond being some kind of catharsis for him as the author, there isn't much here to interest any reader."
5,awesome,All I have to say is what a stunning picture.I love this player.I have it connected to my Toshiba cinema series tvand what a pair.I had to get an hdmi to dvi cable (hdcp)and thats all.I am real impressed with the detail.Not HD but almost if you know what I mean.The remote is just ok
5,Another excellent work by F.F. Bruce,"Excellent commentary. Clear writing. The overall theme and the details are both well expounded throughout. The only small drawback is the occasions when Greek words or phrases are used without definitions, but that should not stop someone from buying this book. Bruce is an excellent author."
5,Great resource for exegetical Greek syntax and background,FF Bruce is one of the most gifted Greek scholars I have ever read. He treats the Scriptures with great respect and is complete with the studies that are brought forth in this commentary. A great resource for Greek scholars.
3,Dated Commentary,This is a dated expositional commentary by F.F. Bruce. The amount of depth and level of detail is lacking for anyone looking for more scholarly dialog on Galatians. I would not recommend this book to someone other than a beginner in biblical studies.
4,Handy,what we were looking for to sharpen up letters etc as I am currently a Dutch speaker and still converse in it
5,An invaluable tool for today,"Scholarly and straight-shooting, Thomas Aquinas and the Liturgy ably and succinctly demonstrates from the life and teaching of the Angelic Doctor his profound grasp of the nature of the Liturgy--the active, bodily contemplation of Christ's redeeming work and its renewal in our very midst--something which the Church of our day needs urgently to rediscover. This book is an invaluable tool for that crucial task."
4,"Hypnotic, confusing but intriguing","If your intention is to parrot back the storyline perfectly, concentrate. But if you can take a stunning visual journey with ambiguities, watch this mesmerizing film. Like a rich dark chocolate it must be relished."
4,Twists & Turns,"Such a wonderful story. Twists and turns go on and on... but not in a complicated manner. Definitely keeps you wanting for more!The ending was a bit disappointing... that's all I will say. Perhaps they didn't know where to go with the story... or, they just wanted an ""artistic"" finish.The ""journey"" watching the film was great. The final two minutes... the ""destination""... was disappointing, but the acting and production were excellent!"
3,not as engaging as I had hoped...,"This is not a time waster, but I had no care or concern for the outcome. I had no connection to the characters. The costumes and scenery are delightful so if you are a fan of period films you will be visually stimulated."
3,"Putting together a puzzle, but missing some pieces","A well made movie piecing together the linking puzzle pieces of various lives (mostly aristocratic) in 19th Century Europe. It's lovely, often dark (in mood, not in luminescence), well acted, with subtle dynamism to the cinematography. The unremarked-upon device of on screen observers watching the primary players through doorways and windows and listening from around corners is intriguing.Unfortunately, it's too easy to lose track of the players and I was left with too many puzzle pieces missing. At four and a half hours a movie really needs to be more than the sum of its parts and ""Mysteries of Lisbon"", as good as the parts were, did not assemble those parts into a superior whole."
5,Teenage Son can get himself up now!,"What was once a lost cause has now turned into self-discipline and little nagging from parents. This alarm clock uses a variety of methods that change until it is turned off. There are a variety of buzzer sounds, lights flash, and the ingenious mattress jiggler that all combine to get our son out of bed on his own most of the time. We still do a run-by to see if has ignored it, since we are so used to having to shake him to wake him. We have been pleasantly surprised to see such an improvement!! I think the other half of the equation is his desire to wake up, and we're still working on that, but at least he hears and feels this one!!"
4,Father Time,"My intention with this clock was to startle my deaf 9 yr. old son enough so by the time I get there he'll be expecting me and get up a little easier. It worked once. I know he feels the vibrator and he just doesn't move. The clock is awesome. It has the vibrator, loud and obnoxious alarm that can change to different tones to suit your needs and very, very bright and colorful lights that flash and go haywire. It seems like something would wake him up since I can hear and wake up to it at the other end of the house."
1,Arrived broken-felt fragile,"The clock worked but the alarm didn't. The buttons and dials to select what kind of alarm you want felt fragile and did not feel like they could stand up to much use. The concept is great and I bet the original engineer's model was great but this clock feels like it was redesigned to conserve every penny in production. The clock face is quite bright but can be turned down a setting or turned off. It still seemed a bit bright on low but I never saw it at night so I am not sure if that is correct.I never heard the alarm and I never felt the vibrator. Even though I prefer analog clocks, I wouldn't recommend this one. Perhaps the digital versions from this company are better. The vibrator was nice and heavy and did feel like it could take some abuse."
1,Not the best,Did not like this - not the best quality and this was awkward to use. I would recommend looking around for a vibrating clock and research before buying one.
1,Do you really want analog?,"Bought this for my college son to stop missing morning classes. I got it out of the box & set the alarm to go off in 3 minutes. Well, it came & went & never went off. The instructions were not detailed or helpful at all in setting the alarm. I put it right back in the box & sent it back. I'm ordering another one but it will be digital for sure. I guess it would be ok if you set the alarm every night before bed, but I rather set it once & forget about it until the weekend when it is time to turn it off."
2,unpredictable - does not always go off,"This alarm is loud, and does a great job of waking anyone up. However, sometimes the alarm would not go off, especially after setting a new alarm time or if you hit the snooze button too hard and knock it off your bedstand. I'm not sure if it's a QC issue or if it's due to the analog mechanism, but I went through reviews of SonicAlert products, and it seems that quite a few of them mention time-keeping problems."
3,Sonic Alarm Clock,I bought this for my deaf mom & it shakes the house but not her :o( The alarm would wake the dead but again not her. :o( I had high hopes for this product.
1,Worthless garbage,This solutions manual is absolutely worthless. It contains solutions to maybe 10 percent of the problems. Don't buy it! I recommend Physics as a Second Language (Stuart Loucks) plus whatever text you are forced to purchase.
2,Not what I had expected...,"This book contains answers to only some of the odd numbered problems. All of the even-numbered problems are already in the accompanying text book. While this student manual contains actual explanations of the solutions, the actual amount of explanations leaves much to be desired. Only every 4-6 odd questions are actually given. For those expecting a consistent homework helper, this is probably not a decent investment. If all you want are decent examples of how to tackle certain types of problems, this is probably for you."
4,it okay,the book is old and not many solutions are in the book. The solutions that were in the book helped a lot.
1,You get what you pay for...,The bag is extremely flimsy. It does not zip but rather buckles closed and the strap that holds one of the buckles on broke and fell off within the first week I used it.
3,Great bag,"but tripod is not going to hold up. Not very sturdy. However the bag is great, padded, well constructed, love the dividing pockets."
3,Very nice camera bag,I find the bag to be just what I wanted. Large enough for my camera and lenses and a few extras. The tripod is very light but very sturdy. A great buy.
3,"Great, but flawed","I have the silver version of this camera. (It uses the same 600 film so I assume they are the similiar (if not the same), just different colors). I think Polaroid instant cameras are great, but there are a few niggling problems. 1) Photos often lack sharpness and can look slightly out of focus, 2) For some reason an occasional photo will come out as if it has already been half-exposed, and 3) There is no counter to tell you how many pictures you have left! This is the most annoying aspect b/c you only get 10 photos per pack (and they're kind of spendy). There is little more frustrating than to press the button and have nothing happen. I believe there is a counter on the Joycam, but I prefer the traditional Polaroid size and shape. Otherwise, I still think this is a quality, fun camera and there is nothing better than not having to drop off your film for development."
3,Mediocre,"I got this camera as a hand me down. It works great for instant gratification, but it is hard to get a quality picture. They can be blurry, or the person's head will end up really small and not in the place I wanted it to be in the picture."
2,The quintessential one-hit wonder.,"Sacred Cow is an album you've all heard before. One dynamic single, ""whoever you are"", two very good songs, ""Sacred Cow & Las Vegas with the Lights Out"", and a truckload of mediocre, directionless material. The mixtures of pop, funk, and jazz is pleasant to listen to, but also very frustrating, as the album's tracks are wildly incosistent. This is hardly essential listening. Wait til' ""whoever you are"" is on a 90's alternative compilation. Geggy Tah's Sacred Cow offers very little to the listener."
1,"Whoever you are, don't buy this","This band is a half hit wonder with their song ""Whoever you are."" The rest of their songs don't sound like like their half hit song ""Whoever you are."" If you find it used, then listen to it and see if you like it."
4,Great CD that will never get the respect it deserves,"I have owned this CD for about 3 years and I still love it.""Don't Close the Door,"" is one of the best songs on the disc, with great lyrics. If you are in the mood ""Sacred Cow"" is great, but if you are not it doesn't work. Buy it!!"
3,Nerd-Funk on a par with Cake or Soul Coughing.,"I first heard Geggy Tah as the opening act for Rusted Root several years back, and they were one of the best openers I've ever seen. I got this album the day afterward. Several weeks later they came back and played a full show, which was equally entertaining. Their energy and humor live doesn't really come across on the cd, but it's still a very enjoyable album. Apart from the perfect pop of ""Whoever You Are,"" standouts include the room-cleaning anthem ""Lotta Stuff,"" the melodic funk trips ""Don't Close the Door"" and ""Las Vegas with the Lights Out"" and ""Gina"" one of the finest ballads ever written about a dog (she's on the cover.) Several of the songs are rather monotonous, but they generally have a good vibe. Also the album notes are very clever. This is not a classic album by any means, but it was a neglected solid piece of work from the mid-nineties."
3,Odd Sounding Rock Band,"This CD had 2 good songs that I listen to off of it. Whoever You Are and Gina. But mainly Whoever You Are, which is a good reason to buy this CD if you can find it real cheap. You may like the CD more than I do. But if you are looking for some odd sounding bands, then pick this up. And try to get the Space CD Spiders. Which is another odd sounding band that is better than this."
1,Worst Memory Foam Pillow out there,"I would never recommend this pillow to anyone ---> Emson Pleasure Pedic Memory Foam Pillow.I bought mine on eBay, but I have to tell you it's not like any memory foam product I've ever had. I love all my memory foam products except for this brand. I am not sure I how to explain this, but it's as if the pillow is compressed and hard as a rock. There is no press and bounce back like other memory foam products."
1,not firm enough!,"I love memory foam pillows and have had great experience with them... This pillow, however, is to flat, it looks plenty big until you actually use it and realize it sinks in way to much. Because of it's flat shape it does not support the neck the way other memory foam pillows do. Keep searching, there are far better memory foam pillows out there!"
3,"well wrought, but the vein's close to mined out","Enya does more of the same--which she does very well indeed, but it's time to move on. The one exception, sad to say, is ""Anywhere Is,"" which were it not for the chord changes could be argued to be an attempt at minimalism. Listening to ""Anywhere Is"" is much like listening to blackboards being scratched. Aside from this one track, good job, but I hope she takes a break and finds some new inspiration."
1,So so so Boring and uninspired,"I love Watermarket and Shepperd Moons but this record is just pure boredom, I am very disappointed, I cannot listen to it without getting this feeling of stupidity due to the constant repetition of the musical lines. That's not music, its boredom. Get Watermark instead."
3,Lulls one to sleep,"At first listening to this CD, the music sounds a lot like that on the Watermark album. But upon a second listening, the music sounds different, though of the same style. The tone and pace of the music on this album is similar to that of other albums, but the melodies are different. This album has both instrumental and singing, and both are enjoyable. This album makes for great background music, whether over dinner, eating, or napping."
5,Beautiful,"Enya weaves her voice and words into a beautiful tapestry of pure spirit and wonder. Her voice paints pictures in your mind, it lets your heart and soul soar. Enya is truly a wonderful artist with talent brimming out of her."
4,Enya WILL Remove You From This Earth...,"In Memory of Trees is yet another great effort from this exquisite lady. Take this one with you as you hike through the forest during a misty sunrise. Trust me, I've tried it. My favorite track is ""Athair Ar Neamh"" whatever that means. This is a must for all Enya fans. Her voice gently sooths the soul after a hectic day."
5,A gorgeous and interesting compilation of songs,"I'm an Enya fan, to be sure, and this CD offers a nice ""mix"",(for lack of a better word) of styles. ""Pax Deorum"" with it's chilling Latin refrains. ""La Sonadora"" having a Spanish torreador ballad feeling, and the absolutely beautiful refrains in ""Athair Ar Seamh"" display her vocal and writing talents. And who can deny that ""China Roses"" is one of the most smooth,sweet vocal pieces to grace a CD?? The Memory of Trees is a stellar Enya disc!"
4,"Maybe not the best, but good","Well, all I can say is that if you like Enya, you're probably going to like this one too, but I did not like it *as much as* other CDs of hers. Surprisingly, I liked ""Anywhere Is"", even though it has a very simple theme and although it is on the verge of becoming boring, it doesn't... It is probably one of the few songs I can listen to while I do other things. Well, if you're looking for relaxing, easy-listening music, you might want to try this one (as well as other Enya CDs)."
4,"Okay, but not her best album","Enya is one of those odd categories of music that neatly crosses the ""new age/ethereal"" line into ""popular"" on more than one occassion, yet without compromising its original artistic integrity. This album is not as solid as ""Watermark"", but contains several good tracks. It has a brighter, more whimsical bent than ""Shepherd Moons"", but isn't the best choice for first time Enya listeners."
4,In a little slum.....,"I must say that while I truly love Enya's music, this album is my least favorite of all of hers. It is good, don't get me wrong, but I do not feel as engrossed in the music on this one as I am in the other ones. Ok, so maybe, Enya has bored me a bit this time, but some of the tunes are awfully good, such as, ""The Memory of Trees"" and ""Anywhere Is."" So, I would never dismiss it as a poor pick, and I do feel that it is a valid Enya album. It is full of beautiful songs (as is the case with all of her records), and the vocals are ethereal as always. I would recommend it, though if I were you, I would let this be my first Enya experience, for the rest in the line, and those before it, are, to me, a little better."
4,Enjoyable,"I only recently discovered this album by Enya, as for years I only knew it through her ""Paint the Sky with Stars"" CD. It is a nice CD, and it shows Enya experimenting more with synthetic orchestral sounds like ""Anywhere Is"" and with a more pop atmosphere on songs like ""On My Way Home"", though not as overdone like she did on her recent ""Amarantine"".The low points are ""From Where I Am"", which sounds like a new version of ""No Holly for Miss Quinn"", and ""Tea House Moon"", which sounds like something off of a quirky sci-fi soundtrack and not like the peace and beauty it was supposed to represent. Otherwise, the album is nice and has a good variety, ranging from the hushed ""Athair Ar Neamh"" to the lively ""On My Way Home"". I do have to agree, though, with other reviews that some of these pieces are not exactly unique. I believe it was with this album that Enya began to be caught in the web of sameness and sadly has not gotten out yet."
4,Almost her best.,"Her first three CDs: The Celts (aka Enya), Watermark, and Shepherd Moons are truly inspired. You simply don't want to miss a single song on any of them.More recent are The Memory of Trees and A Day without Rain, which are also very good.You could buy Paint the Sky with Stars, which contains music from her first four CDs. It is longer and therefore better than any one of them, but you would then realize that you have to go out and buy all four anyway.Her music is often ethereal, but I think its real secret is that even her most joyous songs tend to have a dark element. For example, if you like music by U2, REM, Rush, Pink Floyd, Supertramp, etc., then you will like Enya."
5,sex machine review,Classic James Brown high energy entertainment. A true entertainer with no equal.His music has and always will reach a wide spectrum.
5,Great and functional device,"This adapter allows printers w/ regular serial connections to be hooked up via/ usb to an imac, b&w G3, g4 or cube. It comes w/ all necessary drivers but you must order the proper Serial cable if you do not have one. On keyspan.com their is a great list of supported printers. Other then the print deskjetdirect for networks this is the best solution for hooking up older printers or non usb printers to new apple computers."
1,Bad C/S support makes adapter worthless,"I have the original serial adapter. Keyspan has never updated their software so that it works with MacOS (9.0 - 9.2). Software conflicts with all peripherals, creates networking problems. I've tried contacting Keyspan to find a solution, but they don't respond to customer emails."
2,"Good, but does not work in OSX with an old printer...","I mistakenly purchased this product to use with an ibook for printing in OSX AND CLASSIC with an old Apple Laserwriter 300. Bad news: because the old printer does not have software for OSX, I cannot use the adapter with OSX! This adapter works easily with my old printer in the ""classic"" mac OS on my ibook; however, printing is very slow. So if you want to use an old printer with both OSX and Classic OS, forget about this product."
4,Battery for Palm IIIc,I had to make some changes. but it works well.The battery arrives on time and it's good.I think that I made a good deal.
5,"Perfect for long, quiet evenings - evocative and lovely.","I grew up with my mother's Frank Sinatra records. Somehow, they were the only ones that survived all of our moves from country to country and became a link with home. Even now, after being on my own for over twenty years, hearing Sinatra's rich baritone transports me to evenings at home when I was younger. Quiet evenings, no TV available, filled with Sinatra's voice and, often Nelson Riddle's arrangements. Conducive to thinking, and feeling, and remembering. This album is no exception. It's a later release than some of his other ballad albums - like Only the Lonely, and has some newer pieces, such as McCartney's ""Yesterday."" But it's a gem, beguiling, warming, lyrical and haunting. There's nothing like Sinatra for a long, quiet evening at home, alone or with friends, and complete with a friendly glass of amber liquid."
4,"A Terrific Group of Songs,but let's face it,mainly repeats..","Just about every song here was already a classic, even in the versions here. Still, if you want a nice set of top ballads from Reprise condensed on one disc, go no further.Also, some of them are fairly hard to get elsewhere, and are not on other Reprise collections. The title song,about a loser with a sense of humor,is just the first among all the first rate numbers here.Plus this CD gives a 25 year look at Frank ballads. My main beef is that perhaps they should have been arranged in order of when they were recorded,like many of FS's compilations. This is very highly recommended for the slightly older prospective fan,who really does not know where to go in picking Frank's vast material.So yes, it is a must buy for that individual!"
5,Wonderful collection from the later years...,"Sinatra's Reprise recordings are usually held to be lesser than the Capitol sets, but this album has some of the most affecting songs from the later library. The best part is that these are not all the standards that appear on every other Sinatra collection, making it a wonderful collection to listen to at night.Some tracks -- ""All My Tomorrows"", ""Summer Wind"", ""The Gal Who Got Away"" -- are remarkable. Sinatra sounds uncertain on ""Yesterday"", but the great far outweighs the ""almost great"".Recommended!"
5,Blood Pressure Cuff,"My doctor asked me to purchase this particular monitor about 6 weeks ago because he was worried that I might be developing high blood pressure. I started checking my BP twice a day and found the cuff very easy to use. My BP did seem to fluctuate a lot so after a few weeks I decided to clean up my act and cut out a lot junk food (expecially sugar). Within a week I was amazed to see my BP had returned to a normal range. I am definitely obese, so this is a great discovery for me and has really led to a major change in my outlook. This might have just been the best purchase I have made in a long time."
5,Very easy to use!,"I have had this monitor for nearly nine months and it has worked great. My blood pressure was getting close to the hypertension range and I was getting very concerned that at 48, I would require blood pressure medicine before I was 50. I wanted a monitor, but I wanted something that was easy to use and checked both blood pressure and pulse. This works great for both blood pressure and pulse and the LCD screen was very easy to see and allows you to you can save all of your readings and graph them if you want.I initially checked my blood pressure every morning and every evening, now I just check it periodically. My recommendation is to try different methods to lower your blood pressure and check it constantly until you figure out what works best. Running proved to have the most positive effect on me, but I also recommend a good glass of Pinot Noir every night. :)"
4,Reliable and accurate,"I owned this product for about two years now. I find it to be reliable and accurate. After recently questioning a reading from the blood mobile, I took a reading at home just moments later. My reading was 20 point below that from the blood mobile. I printed out my last years readings and took it to my doctor who compared his readings with mine. The readings seem to be in the same range as were our readings for this particular day.When the batteries get low, it takes a long time to get a reading. It may even fail. If this happens, try changing the battery. I intend to try raising my arm without bending it as was suggested by another reviewer."
4,Easy to use,This cuff is so easy to use and the way it graphs your history is helpful too. Sucks battery juice pretty fast though so would be nice to have an AC option. Seems to be a good buy for the price.
5,Excellent Product!,"This is my second purchase for my cousin, after he saw me using it at my home.I really like this product and like the interface and accuracy.Wish the price was lower than 65$..Other than that, its excellent!"
5,Blood Pressure Cuff,I am over the wellness program at my work place. I purchased this product for use of employees (300). I am very pleased with this product it has been a great tool for our wellness program.
1,Inaccurate readings,"I bought this as a possible replacement for an old Lumiscope 1090 with an LCD starting to burn out and thought I'd give this one a try. The Lumiscope has matched my doctor's reading every time we've tested, so it provides me a gold standard for comparing against -- the Omron was 10-20 points off over several readings. Returned to Amazon."
4,Wrist Blood Pressure monitor,Omron HEM-637 wrist Blood Pressure Monitor is a useful small blood pressure monitor. It is very easy to use and consistantly reproducible.
3,More difficult to get a reading than described,Took too much time to fing the right spot to get a reading. Didn't always get an accurate reading. Exchanged it for a cuff monitor.
5,Great!,I bought for my mom. I want to buy one for myself too. It's good for no medical background people.
3,Follow up comment,"Though I don't own this unit, I was interested in the comments about the lack of software and an interface cable. I found the European version mentioned by another reviewer, but at Weston's, the British health equipment store, the Omron 637 with USB cable and software sold for US$243.36 (plus shipping). That's quite a premium for a cable and some software! I think pad and paper might work just as well."
2,Can't get it to turn in,"It works great when you can get it to turn on, but the start/stop button is extremely finicky."
2,HEM 637 Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor,The product was delivered promptly and I just couldn't get an accurate reading... it read way low. So I returned it and was promptly given my refund. I would definitely deal with this seller again.
5,blood pressure monitor,"Happy to say I am very pleased with this product. It gives excellent details, and is easy to follow instructions. Thank you and I will be looking for other products to purchase. I would recommend this product to other individuals."
1,Not ok for people who are hypertensive,"I tryed to use this many times and became frustrated with inacurate readings and finally read the box, it is not accuarte for people with high blood proessure. The same day I went to the doctor it was 30 points off."
4,Easy to use...,This is the first blood pressure monitor I have had...I was a bit leary that I would have a hard time with it...It works great - the Advanced Positioning Sensor takes the guess work out of the location of your arm when taking your pressure.The only thing I have a difficult time with is the history graph - but that could just be a learning curve for me.
1,stinky,The blood pressure cuff smelled bad when I took it out of the box; it had no batteries either.
1,Inaccurate info,"I got this unit for my mom for x-mas and am planning to return it. It is inaccurate. My mom measured her blood pressure twice daily since x-mas and it was fluctuating. Then a couple of days ago she checked her blood pressure several times in a row. Each time there were widely different readings. How is it possible? So it is unreliable unit for we can't tell which readings are accurate. Since it doesn't do what it is supposed to do I wasn't gonna give it any stars, but I gave one star because it's compact and easy to use. Although it's useless."
4,fuel constrained flights,"The early sections of the book furnish a good introduction to the basics of celestial mechanics. Newtonian gravitation, two body problem, and motions of celestial bodies. Where it starts to get interesting is in explaining how to find the orbit of such a body, based on a minimum number of observations. Clearly aimed at the astronomer in you. Then the theory is developed further into the n-body problem, with the 3 body problem being an important special case.But the truly modern material is in the discussion of interplanetary flights. Takes some time in the book to actually get to its ostensible topic. Hohmann trajectories are given wide coverage, because in our current level of technology, our spacecrafts are fuel constrained, more than anything else. Hence we make trajectories that minimise to the utmost fuel consumption.The book then recaps several missions. Notably the Grand Tour by the two Voyagers to the outer solar system. Wonderfully successful."
3,Just like an Inkjet. You pay for it in the cartridges.,"Good product but only prints on ""shiny"" DVD/CD's not those made for printers. Much better deal when you buy 3 at a time."
2,Okay ..........,"Okay, I love your printer, but Casio, can't you give us more for our money on the ribbons?"
3,Picture Confusion,Please be careful ordering this. The pictures led me to believe I was buying a 3-pak. It's for one ribbon only!!!
2,Bad Investment...,"Looking to print on CDs? These worked decent but in the long run, it is better to invest in a Canon Printer that will print on CDs. Yes! Unfortunately due to Epson's patent, Canon disabled their printing tray in the U.S. Market. But you can easily purchase a printing tray off ebay and get it to work. I own a Canon MP500 with print tray D and it works great. Pictures/Text/Full Color... the result looks amazing. The Casio ribbons will print about 20 Discs or so before it runs out of tape! That is very short... The Canon printer will do atleast 500 Discs before it runs out of ink. The ratio is 7:20 (35 cents per disc print w/ text only) vs. 50:500 (10 cents per disc print w/ full color text/pictures)."
1,buy a magnifying glass with it,this book looks adorable online but it's teeny tiny. check the size closely...i obviously missed the fine print. pun intended. doesn't make much sense to me that a grandfather book is so small even someone with perfect vision would have trouble reading it.
3,Not for overclocking even though it says it is...,"Good matx board, though not what I expected for overclocking. Has a few OC'ing features but very limited ones.If you're not planning to use it for gaming go ahead, it's a fine choice."
2,PCA Skin pHaze 13 Pigment Gel Dyschromia Controller,"I've tried several products that promise to reduce pigmentation on the face. Alas, one more product that I have been disappointed with. I did not experience the burning or redness that other reviews spoke about, but I have neither seen a reduction in my level of pigmentation on my face or neck.To be fair, I am only about a third of the way through the bottle, but I'm not convinced that this product will work for me in the way I hoped it would. Perhaps it will work for other skin types, it does not appear to be working so well on mine. I am fair skinned, with a little sallowness, but the dark spots do stand out and I'd like to find a product that really reduces the pigment on those target areas of my face and neck.Any suggestions out there?"
2,"Promising start, but really nothing new or different","Renee Halvorsen, winner of Dorchester Publishing's Historical Voice Contest, shows promising talent, but unfortunately this novel doesn't quite succeed as a romance novel. Ms. Halverson gives us an exciting opening - Faith, the heroine, is discovered cheating at cards and it's revealed that she's making a desperate and heroic effort at supporting orphaned/abandoned children, many of them the illegitimate babies of prostitutes. Unfortunately the excitement fades from there.Initial sexual tension between the hero and heroine fizzles out and their ""consummation"" completely lacks sensuality. I hoped for a sizzling, sexy love scene but the author describes it so clinically that the passion doesn't leak off the pages at all, as fans of romance expect.This is a nice effort from a new writer, though, and congratulations to Ms. Halvorson. Two stars"
2,Incredibly Boring Romance - Same Old Thing,"This book started out great. The heroine is cheating during a poker game. She is caught and manages to escape by outwitting her captors. What a refreshing change from the normal boring virginal do-gooder heroines that I always read about. Then the book goes downhill. It turns out the heroine is a normal boring virgin who takes in orphans. She cheats at cards to support them. After she escapes in the beginning of the book, her IQ drops dramatically. After she loses her virginity, it becomes non-existent. Just pass on this one. I am sure you have read it before many, many times."
3,Not as sharp as I'd hoped for.,The lens is nice and light weight but kind of slow to focus and the focus isn't as sharp as I would've thought. I have trouble with my eyesight so I really rely on on my autofocus. What looks great through the lens doesn't always look so hot in production on my computer. I'm sure there's a bit of a leaning curve and I'll probably get used to it and compensate for it. Can't beat the price.
5,Marvellous Erotica,"I love these Best lesbian Erotica selections, and this one is a goodie! Full marks to the editors for selecting tales both well written and arousing!"
5,Curl up with this book instead of your longtime companion,"Ever wondered what to do next? This book will tell you what, where, and how. The collective experience of a dozen feminist erotic writers will guide you in the ways of giving - and receiving the ultimate pleasure known to womyn. From analingus to zooastery, you'll love every page"
2,"Cute idea, bad performance","I was so excited about getting this product. I couldn't wait for snowflakes to be dancing across my house; however, this was not to be. Assembly was very, very difficult. When I finaly got it done I tried to shine it on a wall inside the house. We had to turn off every single light in the whole house for it to even be visible. Then we couldn't get it to focus. When we put outside you coudln't even tell they were snowflakes that were falling. I really wish this product would have worked."
4,So cool and so 50's!,"I loved this item. Our neighbor had one when I was growning up, and I just had to have it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that I didn't think the projection was as bright as it could have been, but it might just have been the shape of my house. It was very spooky at Halloween, but I couldn't show it at Christmas because my outside lighting dimmed the reindeer so much that you couldn't see them very well."
1,THIS IS JUNK,THIS IS A PIECE OF JUNK. I HAVE TO WONDER IF THE OTHER COMMENTS ARE NOT RIGGED. I BOUGHT IT LAST SEASON AND TRY TO USE IT. HALF UNFOCUSED IMAGES. NOT WORKTH IT. TRIED TO RETURN IT BUT IT WAS PAST 30 DAYS. SAVE YOUR MONEY.
3,Not Enough Padding,"Was disappointed in the amount of padding in this dog bed. I bought it for our disabled German Shepherd and needed to buy some foam padding to insert inside. Like the fact that I can unzip it to wash it, though."
2,Dog bed flat,"Was pleased with the size, but not the substance. Very little filling and provides little to no padding for dog. I got the biggest size for my dog that has displasia in his elbows, he only lays on it if there is no where else to lay down."
2,Lasted Almost A Week,"I am very surprised that Coleman would put out crap like this. There is hardly any padding, the cloth material ripped to shreds just by my dobbie walking on it. I think Coleman is a terrific company, but they missed the mark on this thing."
2,Padding is too thin.,"The bed has a nice, durable nylon base material. The top plaid material is soft. The bed is easy to clean using a vacuum cleaner. However, the padding is too thin. I had the model smaller than this one, but it got torn apart in a fit of rage by my shephard/lab. When I was looking for a replacement bed, I read a review that said these beds have padding that is too thin, and that two pads for a single bed is needed. That gave me an idea. I bought a new bed, and put the pad from the torn-apart bed into it. I pinned the pads together, and the bed is now really soft and plush. My dog loves it. Keep in mind that I was forced to get another bed since my dog shredded the first one. It really does need more padding. I was fortunate in that I had padding from my first bed I could still use to supplement the new one I just bought. If I knew how thin the padding was, I wouldn't have bought the first bed. If this is the scenario you are in, avoid this bed."
1,Flat,"This dog bed is very flat! The pad comes in a vaccume sealed bag which did fill out after opening, but not alot. The cover is nice but after the first wash it started falling apart. Not a good dog bed!"
2,Not my kind,Didn't care for this movie. Didn't keep me interested and I didn't finish watching it. It's not often I don't finish a movie.
4,Songs in The Key Of Greatness,"A great album for a great show. ''Songs In...'' also shows the soft side of Filter, the eerie side of Sheryl Crow, and the ambient side of Elvis Costello. All in all, a good CD."
4,TV Rockers,"Even though track 5 wasn't needed, the rest of the songs fit the show. The producers of the film should've used this as their soundtrack. While the movie CD was good, it wasn't as dark and as wierd as the show itself."
5,A great combination of artists,"I loved every song, with the exception of the one by Rob Zombie and Alice Cooper. It is as deep, dark, entertaining, and (at times) oddly amusing as the real show is. This CD is a success, and I would recommend it to just about everyone."
4,songs,"There's lots of cool songs and an extra bit of something before the first track. They're all cool songs except the one that says f*!# me kitten in it. That one is weird. Other than that, it's GREAT. Foo fighters. Sheryl Crow. Etc. And a cool revised version of the X-Files theme song."
4,Grows on you like an alien spore fungus.,A first I thought I'd bought an album so bad it was funny (I still feel that way about parts like 'Star Me Kitten'.) However it grew on me like some alien fungus and now its my favorite road trip album. I'd recommend it to any weird music or X-Files fan. 'Red Right Hand' is Great! And Zero is also a number.
1,Not an aerobic video.,"If you want a video of women wearing black leather vests, this might be for you. If you were looking for an exercise video, this isn't it. It's a waste of money and time.The only reason I gave it one star is that there is no lesser category."
1,Aweful!!!,The content and quality of this tape is just simply aweful! Don't waste your money. Enough said.
1,This video teaches you nothing about Salsa dancing,"They teach you nothing about salsa, not even enough to do the basics with a partner or on your own. I do not recommend this video at all."
5,SUPERB,EXTREMELY VALUABLE BOOK FOR THE LEATHERCRAFTER INTERESTED IN TOOLS OF THE CRAFT.A MUST FOR YOUR LIBRARY AND HAS HELPED ME LOCATE SEVERAL ANTIQUE TOOLS THAT HAS ALLOWED ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE TOOLS OF OUR FOREFATHERS.
5,Easy Spirit Women's Velcro Sneakers,"We just received these today and they fit well, look nice, and are very comfortable! Excellent buy!! Thank-you!"
1,Wait a minute whats going on here????,The book is scrambled I dont know what is wrong here it is unreadable. i love this book and have used the workouts for several years My advice is to buy the paper copy till they get the bugs out of the e-book edition.
5,Love this product!,"I have used this product for over 25 years on all of my dogs. In Florida, we had a horrific flea problem and this worked exceptionally well. I live in North Carolina now, and we dont have the flea problem like we did in Florida, but still I use it in the Summer as a preventative. The dogs coats are beautiful and silky when they dry, and they smell like heaven!"
1,don't bother,I've tried ordering this shampoo several times and the order is always cancelled. Why doesn't the seller or amazon remove stuff that is no longer in stock or discontinued?
3,Expected more from George Forty,"Not a bad book, but having read some of George Forty's earlier books on armour this one simply does not live up to expectations. The book is refreshing insofar as it also covers the rarely discussed exploits of Indian & Pakistani tank commanders in the Indo-Pak wars rather than serving up the same old WWII & Arab-Israeli fare. Unfortunately the overall impression is that of reading a compilation of already published material rather than new research or cross verification done by the author. Otherwise a good read with plenty of rare photographs."
5,Fun Game!,"My 6yo and 4yo love to play this game! I think it's fun too- I enjoy playing with them because they enjoy it so much. Yes, I had to read the rules twice, and then kinda figure it out as we played the first time, but as another reviewer said- after that, it was simple. My 6yo grasped it immediately and my 4yo is able to play with some assistance. I don't think it would be as fun for the 8+ age group as stated on the packaging, however."
5,Moose lovers,"The game says ages 8+ but we play with our 4 & 6 year olds every night. We also played with our 13 year old niece who also loved it. Like many of Gamewright's products, it takes many readings of the instructions and trial runs to understand the game, but once the rules are understood, it is simple."
3,Just OK For Us,"We went on a game buying binge a while back, purchasing several of Gamewright's games. This had great reviews, but wasn't a huge hit at our home. The $8 price seems a little high for basically just a deck of cards. I'm not sure why it comes in such a big box (it takes up more storage space ... this holds true for several of the Gamewright games). It isn't as simple as some (Wig Out, Hiss) but not as difficult as others (Sleeping Queens or Frog Juice, which require several readings of the istructions). It is kind of cute, but not laugh-out-loud funny ... pretty mellow actually. There is a little bit of strategy when you have several cards you could choose to play, but often there are just not many options. The kids don't mind playing it, but it isn't on their top ten list. I probably would have passed on buying this game if I had played it first."
1,Teacher and Parent from NY,"This game is silly and could be fun for kids 5 and under. There is nothing to it- no logic, no thinking, no fun- for older kids and adults. There are so many great choices that I was surprised this game got such good reviews. I will give ours away to a family with a young child."
1,Couldn't figure out the game...,Three adults with advance degrees couldn't figure out how to play this game...we are probably over thinking it. This game definitely premotes patience and determination. Good luck in understanding it.
5,A wonderful adventure by a very brave man.,"I owned a copy of this book,years ago, but can not find it. A thrilling story about his circumnavigaton of Antartica, alone, in a small steel hulled sailing vessel. Foolhardy or brave? I never could say, for sure. If memory serves, he did not take a transmitting radio, only a receiver for news and weather reports. He said that anyone foolish enough to undertake such a journey, should not be able to broadcast a distress. He sailed '' the wrong way'' (against the winds or currents, of the roaring forties. His story underlines the problems and solutions such a feat produces. Well worth the time and effort to obtain this book! (whether you believe his undertaking was foolish or not). A must read. (By: W.R.Bell, '' Squadcar54@aol.com '' 4-7-1999, St.Pete, FL. *end"
2,This is not how to go to Antarctica,"This book is almost a reminder of howNOT to sail around Antarctica. I read his second book which was even worse,since it had a group of ill-assortedpeople picked at the last moment."
2,"Poor reproduction, incomplete","I own a copy of a later edition (1902) of the same book. The print quality of the reprint compared to the original is poor. Some of the pictures, displaying machines are blurred compared with my original. Also, there are many references in the book to figures which in the original version were delivered in an additional booklet. I realized this only after I bought my 1902 copy. I hoped that the reprint would contain these additional figures, which unfortunately is not the case."
1,Boring! Slow streaming,"I am fairly certain I wont be ""renting"" movies this way very often. First of all I chose the movie for a class and after seeing it I am so glad I did not buy it! It was long, boring and did I mention boring....The streaming was poor and on several occasions the movie did not play for quite some time. Not my top Amazon pick."
4,VERY GOOD DEBUT,"VERY GOOD DEBUT BY THE FORMER LEAD GUITARIST OF ONE OF THE GREATEST HARD ROCK BANDS EVER, UFO. EXCELLENT BAND INCLUDING GARY BARDEN ON LEAD VOCALS AND SIMON PHILLIPS ON DRUMS.PRODUCTION WAS HANDLED BY ORIGINAL DEEP PURPLE BASSIST ROGER GLOVER. OPENER ARMED AND READY AND INTO THE ARENA ARE CLASSICS AND THE OTHER SONGS ARE VERY GOOD AS WELL. RECCOMMENDED FOR ALL SCHENKER AND UFO FANS."
5,Schenker at his peak,"I just re-purchased this album - I first bought it on tape back in the 80s and wore it out. Schenker's second solo album, MSG, was almost as good, but this first album is Schenker at his finest. Rapier sharp playing, distinctive flying V sound, great songs, even Gary Barden performing well. It was a pleasure to listen to again."
2,Nicer looking online.,"Unfortunately, these look much cuter online than in real life. The design is wonderful, but the quality is definitely cheap, with the ""stones"" appearing plastic."
5,Awsome Band...Whatever happened to them?,"I saw these guys open for Matchbox 20 In Oklahoma City around 1997-1998. In addition, I also saw them at a concert the KATT (radio station here in Oklahoma City) threw. These guys were awsome. I had never heard of them until I saw them play. I guess these guys just didn't get the publicity they deserved. If you like Matchbox 20, you will like this CD."
5,MIA,"What happened to this wonderful band? Its hard to believe that these guys have nothing more to say. It'd be a shame if its so. If a CD can be worn out, this is the one."
5,saw them live!,I saw them live in a tiny little hole in the wall bar in Cincinnati in 1997 or 1998 and had them all sign my cd cover. It was an awesome show and this cd remains one of my absolute favorites after all these years. (They were the opening act for a little known band called Matchbox 20 at that show.)
2,Argument Starter,"We played this game with my husband and 3 children that are 9, 10 and 11. It was frustrating for the kids because their minds try to put the cards together logically. Where my husband and I think so outside of the box that it just didn't work well. I agree with other reviews that I read that it ends up causing arguments and is not a good family game for the age range. It may have been better for the kids to play among themselves or a group of adults. Certainly not all together though."
2,Wish they would have chosen all tangible items,It started off like a great game and then the cards were dealt. The problem with this game is they use non tangible or quantifiable objects. For example: can a girafee fit in a wish? How about a reflection? Can a parking lot fit in Danger- can Power fit in a the past? These are actual examples of things written on the cards.It just made for an anything goes game where I just wanted it to end- so I could take it back to the store.
1,Buy this only if you enjoy arguing,"I bought this thinking it would be a fun family game over the holidays. Our kids range in age from 11 to 21, and all of them love games. Despite our best efforts, no one liked ""In a Pickle."" We argued about too many of the plays. Perhaps we are all too literal in our thinking, or just too competitive. We've played it twice, and I suspect never will again. Better family game suggestions: Mexican train dominos, Skippo, and Battleship... which are good for all ages."
2,Game caused a lot of arguments,"I got this game and had high hopes for it with my Wednesday gaming group. But the rules leave room for interpretation and we had several disagreements with each other as to what goes in or on something else. We did the democratic thing and voted to solve disputes, but still this game left a bad taste in some peoples' mouths. As a result, I stopped bringing this game and gave it away at a Christmas raffle. It's intended to be fun, but be prepared for some disagreements among players."
1,"End this game, please","This game made absolutely no sense. We played it once and my older son let his younger brother win, simply to end the boredom."
2,Yawn,"Yes. It's good at first, almost the perfect game. But soon it gets boaring. If you are considering to buy it for a preasent start to rethink. It gets boring REAL easily. Please take in my warning; don't waste your money. I may be the only one who says it is boaring but just listen to me. DO NOT BUY IN A PICKLE!!!"
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,This is a very boring game. I find that the rules leave so much to the imagination that there really is very little boundaries or structure. I do not recommend this game.
4,maximizing the educational value,"Not only does this game help kids with spatial awareness, comparison and proportion, but each playing card contains one word---a great boon to young spellers. Lots of giggles as kids present arguments about how one object can fit inside another one. Encourages creative thinking!"
5,"Excellent Game For All, Especially Campers","While camping in PA this past summer I came across this game in Target. I was looking for a game that seemed simple to play and did not have alot of pieces, and this was it. Its easy, the row is started with one noun card and you just go bigger. My cousins and I (ages 21-25) played this game all the time. But any age can play this game and have fun its that easy. And funny when you try to get people to give a thumbs up for your combination. Its so simple after many plays we started making up our own lingo and names for certain moves in the game. Bottom line if your looking for a simple, funny, pass the time game this is it! Enjoy."
2,an interesting concept that is ultimately bogged down by self interest.,"The concept of the game is easy enough, players attempt to place cards in order of either greater or smaller sizes depending on a particular stack. One could argue that the concept of the word ""love"" is bigger than a parking lot, so a parking lot could fit within the scope of love. The point is anyone is capable of arguing their case, but when it's put to a vote, unless it's an extremely solid argument, players vote on whatever benefits themselves. where this game fails is in it's lack of anonymity. When something is put to a vote that could tip the game one way or another players will always vote for whats best for them. ""In a Pickle"" attempts to be both competitive and engaging. It's overambitious which leaves it wanting in every aspect."
4,Great Game,"In A Pickle is a really fun game and can be quite amusing to play. My family, friends and I enjoy it quite a lot. It can be a little confusing once and a while but it's pretty simple usually once you get the hang of it. It's easy for people to get mixed up once and a while and try to do things backwards on accident though. (Try to play something smaller instead of bigger.) but someone always realizes it & corrects them and we have a laugh and continue the game as usual. Give this game a try -- You won't regret it."
3,Fun for older kids & adults,The instructions are a tad confusing and ambiguous. We (12yo child) ended up setting our own guidelines and rules. Regardless of the rough start we enjoy playing the game.
5,Fantastic quality,"As I've purchased a wonderful circus play tent by bazoongi and love it I wanted to by an additional play tent after we've had the circus tent for 2 years and 2 wild kids been playing roughly in it and it's still in new condition. I don't think these tents can be compared to other play tents. They are a class of their own, very sturdy, beautifully colourful and great size.I bought the bug house tent for my 3 and 5 year old quite tall kids having seen how well they both fit in the circus tent, still with plenty of playroom, I assumed this was also roomy and now that I've put it together it's even larger than I expected.It's easy to assambleThey look great, I actually prefer to keep them in the living room cause they look great.Great sizeBright colorsGreat qualityI only leave reviews when I'm extremely happy with a product and I'm very picky.I wholeheartedly recommend this and also the circus tent made by bazoongi!"
1,BEWARE Nonstick material get's into your food!,"I bought this pan at Walmart about 2 months ago. I've only used it maybe 5 times. The nonstick material is falling off into my food. I tried to contact Wearever customer service in the time they said thier hours are available, and I keep getting a recording telling me that they are closed due to the holiday. I wasn't aware of a national holiday on April 16, 2007. I've had to throw out a very expensive prime rib roast because of this defect. I wouldn't encourage anyone to buy this product.If you found this review helpful, please click yes. Thanks!"
2,You get what you pay for,I bought this roaster pan and used it only a couple of times before the coating started to chip off the bottom. It looks and feels like a nice pan at first but just doesn't hold up well.
4,ROASTER,This is the second roaster I have had like this. It does a nice job browning and cleans up easily. The non-stick finish becomes hard to clean after a couple of years of use. I like this one because it has the handles that fold down flat; takes up less cupboard space.
5,Inexpensive quality clasp,This is an inexpensive quality clasp. So far they are holding up very well on various projects. I will order them again.
2,Felt ripped off,"I thought I was buying a paperback book. (That's how its listed) But for $1.96 plus $3.95 shipping, I received a pamphlet, just a few pages long. The info was ok, but not worth nearly $6.00!!"
4,Satisfied with BUSLink,I have been using BUSLink USB hard drive for over a year without any problems/incidents. I have moved it back and forth between laptop and desktop and different OS's without incident.
4,Does what you need,"I have one word for you with this product. Backup. This hard drive is specifically for backup. I have backed up my hard drive many times with it. If there is something wrong with it or it crashes, its your computer, not the device. Amen."
5,Perceptive study of the psychology of discipline,"This perceptive study of the psychology of discipline is written by a member of an Aristasian community. Aristasia is a fantasy world of femininity and glamour, and discipline, where there are no men. In an era when discipline is performed only for fun and games, this manual on the psychological effects of different disciplinary methods gives a startlingly new perspective. Anyone who is seriously interested in understanding the dynamic of discipline will be fascinated by this work."
2,Mine Just Died Too,"Probably got about 3-4 years of pretty infrequent use out of this machine. Worked well enough until just recently, now I have the H07 error."
4,Interesting and informative,"If you are looking for a well-executed brief history of the Porsche company this is a great video. The production is first rate. If you have seen other videos in the ""Automobiles"" series you will recognize many of the car sounds. The video uses recorded car sound bites and not the actual sounds that the car shown would be making. It doesn't seem to detract from the overall quality of the video, though. There is no in-car racing footage and nothing that I would call exciting in this video, but it covers the history of Porsche road cars from 356-1 into the 356 series and on to the 911 in as much detail as you would expect in a fifty-minute program. A keeper for any Porsche enthusiast and definitely a great tool for a wanna-be Porsche owner that needs to sell a spouse on the idea of buying a Porsche."
3,"Call it ""Sara Paretsky, lite""","Overall, this is not an okay book. It pulls you in enough tht you want to keep reading, but I was distracted by the seeming copycat nature of the book. A single, female detective with a nozy older neighbor who calls her dollface,a troubled family, an inherited dog, and a prickly impatience for those who care and worry about her...where have we seen this before? Kat Colorado could be V.I. Warshawski's twin. However, her character isn't as well developed as Warshawski. Not a bad read, but I'd stick to the original."
3,A slow start,"This is the second book in the series and it is a little slow. It keeps you pulled in and wanting more, though almost not enough. The character is still finding some background and who she is. A good read though the first one and the next one were more exciting."
4,Katapult,The Kat Colorado Mysteries series is clever and funny with interesting character development along with a good mystery story line. Katapult helps to introduce the continuing characters in the series as well as give a good mystery story to read and try to solve. I enjoy how each chapter has a theme around it that helps guide you in comments and thoughts. I look forward to reading and laughing with more stories about Kat Colorado.
4,A good product,"This is a great product. If you can high does it you are much better off. I fyou are like me, and care about your health, Black Rasperry is essential. Dr. oz talked about how it fights free radicals which can lead to lower risk of cancer and other diseases. I take mine in conjunction withBlack Raspberry, Highest Quality, Natural Antioxidant and Illness fight Cure, 120 capsules, 250mg per pill"
2,black raspberry capsules,I am trying this product and cannot tell if I am getting any benefit from taking it. I am taking it along with other vitamins also.
4,Good Quality,It worked well for me..I like the it is freeze dried.. You can smell the raspberries.. the size of the pill is small and easy to swallow..
4,Looked good,"Looked good but never actually got to install thanks to the seller sending me a busted one. Incomplete review because I never actually listened to it, but it looked nice. Beware of Discount Jungles though."
3,"Basic zoom lens, for cheap","What can you say? I bought this as a cheap back up lens. This is a basic, no-frills, inexpensive lens. It is well-made, but picture sharpness is hit or miss, it seems. I am an amateur, so I can't tell if there is any distortion at either end of the zoom range, or in the middle. I haven't seen any significant chromatic aberration yet, but I expect there to be some considering how cheap this is. The auto-focus has difficulty in dim light and bright (sun) light. I wouldn't say it is better or worse than the kit lens that came with my XSi (450D)...but, that lens has the benefit of IS (image stabilization), which the Sigma 18-50 mm f/3.5-5.6 DC does not. If you are on a tight budget, this may be for you, otherwise, steer clear. There are other, better lenses out there (but they will cost you more). By the way, it does come with a small lens hood."
2,Inexpensive Sigma Lens,I purchased this lens because of is low price. I recently purchased a Canon 7D and wanted a wide angle lens but really couldnt afford good glass. This lens gets the wide shots but it's not the sharpest.(nor is it close.) I am happy witht he lens based on my current need for a wide angle and it's super low price.As soon as I get the funds I will be upgrading. Good for now.
3,not very useful,"It has a few styles of screens, I guess for the particular style of investing this could be a useful book, I did not find any use for it."
2,"don't buy it, failure very common","I had this monitor for four years and liked it until it failed one year out of warranty. Flashing on and off at start up until eventually failing to come on at all. I thought it was a problem with the computer, never suspected the monitor. Now reading online I find this is very common due to failing capacitors. Can be fixed by soldering new capacitors on the circuit board if you are a techie. A real shame that this type of equipment doesn't last longer."
5,A very nice and realistic story.....,This book is short but full of emotions and situations. Every single men or women that is thinking in adoption should read it. This book will gave a little notion corcening the adoption process and the adapting process of new son or dougther.... It's also a very light but interesting reading.....
5,Everyone's a Martian,"Although I think this thinly-disguised autobiography is quite amazing, and I had tears in my eyes more than once as I read it, I also think the author ""cleaned up"" the relationship between himself and his adopted son for the sake of narrative. However, if this tender and touching book doesn't make you want to adopt, nothing will. Well worth the short time it takes to read it."
4,Good Read of the Martian Child,"I happened to see part of this movie and wanted to read the book.Its a simple but sweet story, and I enjoyed it a lot. I will passthis on to my daughters to read."
2,weak,"Very readable but ultimately unsatisfying. Based on a true adoption but fictionalized poorly. It doesn't have a dramatic storyline and climax as you would expect a real novel to have. What is presented as a climax is just a statement near the end of the book of ""Of course he isn't really a Martian."" Thud. So why in the world was this written as fiction, building up the child's extraterrestrial abilities, which are completely unbelievable as real autobiography? This novel is also marred by the very self-congratulatory voice of the author. The ""I am so great"" attitude becomes tiresome quickly."
1,A real dissapointment as a novel as on the subject,"I was really looking forward to reading this after reading other reviews on here. What I got out of the book was a sappy story that often went on silly and self-referential tangents that weren't funny or interesting.I'm not a sucker for hallmark stories so I really didn't appreciate when he talk about crying every two seconds. Secondly the complexities that come with adopting an older child with a traumatic background are also brushed over in favor or the positive ""touching"" parts.This is a sappy, unrealistic book. Good for those who appreciate Hallmark type stories and like watching Touched by an Angel."
2,Author of interesting book sells out for cash?,"An interesting book that follows the trials and tribulations of a gay man attempting to adopt a ""problem"" child within the California Adoption System. A Fascinating read and I had actually just finished the book when I noticed that the movie version was playing on ""Dish"". So I thought I'd give it a look-see. This very enjoyable book has been ruined by the changes made by the producers and I assume the author to the extent that the movie has nothing to do with the book. A cast of ""B"" actors including (ooooh won't it be cute if we cast a REAL brother and sister John and Joan Cusack PLAYING a brother and sister in the movie---GAG! Too bad they couldn't find a ""real"" brother and sister who could also act. Well I hope the author made a nice pot of cash and it will make up for the fact that for the rest of his life people will think of the movie rather than the book when they see the title ""The Martian Child""."
5,SO much better than the movie!,"The movie left out so much of what makes this book special. David Gerrold gives the reader a moving view both into his young son's mind, and into his own. One is left wondering where truth leaves off and fiction begins, but then, the point of the book is to convey the feeling behind the experience, and the very slipperiness of reality seems to be an integral part of that experience.That said, I really have got to comment on the Booklist review shown above. ""Ten years ago, sf and fantasy writer Gerrold, a single, gay man, saw a photo of a towheaded kid bursting with life and fell in love. It wasn't what small minds might think..."" Oh, for God's sake. News flash, Ray Olson: only a small mind would even go there. I know it goes on to be a positive review, but to start out that way was unnecessary, tacky, and reeking of the very bigotry you pretend to reject. Poor form, Mr. Olson."
5,"Amazing Father, Amazing Son","This was an amazing story about a middle-aged man in need of a child and a little boy in need of a father. In what would have turned out to be yet another horror story of the U.S. foster care system, came a wonderful relationship and a wonderful life for this little boy. The love, kindness, nurturing and understanding given the Dennis (Sean) by David (the author) is something all children need and deserve, especially children lost in ""the system"". The world would be a much better place with others like David Gerrold would step up and help a child in need with such compassion. I definitely recommend this book. It's also an easy and fast read. I read it in two days and could have read it faster had I not taken breaks."
1,Good for 2 minutes!!,"Maybe my dog's tongue is too long or something, but this just doesn't last her long at all, maybe 2 minutes! I have a smart dog that requires a lot of stimulation to entertain, this just doesn't cut it. I use the Kong Wobbler and that lasts much longer. I also have a Nina Ottosan puzzle and that too is better."
1,Kong Products Are Not Worth It,Every Kong product is not worth the price. My 2 year old black lab can rip them apart in 5 minutes or less. They are just a cheap rubber product. I have learned my lesson. Go with Nylar products.
4,My dog wasn't interested,"Nothing was wrong with this toy, but my miniature dachshund has never shown any interest in it. Although it is small, it's still too big for him to get his mouth around comfortably and I think that's why he avoids it."
5,My dog love it!,Very high quality product! The first one my dog used for over three years now we bought this one to replace the old one.
5,Benjamin loves this toy.,This is a cool toy. It is shaped weird and it bounces funny on the floor. He goes crazy trying to get the treats I stuff inside. So far so good. The toy still looks new. I think it will last a while before it shows some wear.
5,great product,my dog loves this. She knows she will get peanut butter and dog treats before I leave the house when she sees it. Helpful hint: put it in the freezer for an hour before you give it to your dog. makes the prize more difficult to get to (if you use peanut butter or cream cheese) and more challenging for fido.
3,nice,This is the first kong I have purchased for my dog and she doesn't seem to have any interest in it at all.
1,Disappointed,"We had two old Kongs this size, (large) that lasted for years. It was a toy I felt could be left available to the dogs because it was so sturdy. Well, one went missing so I got a new one. I could not believe my eyes. The young dog who had made no headway on the old Kong chewed the new Kong up in a matter of minutes. Shame on the Kong company for cheaping out on materials. They had a good reputation for many years. Maybe it is still made in the USA, but it could have as easily been made of Chinese rubber."
4,Our dogs love their kongs!,"The kongs is great for occupying dogs, especially if you need to kennel all day. The extra large is a bit big for our greyhounds, except for some of the larger males. The large size would probably work fine for most medium to large dogs. They last quite a while. I've finally had to replace two recently after several years of abuse."
2,terrible chemical scent/taste,"Yes, I licked this. Why? because it smelled so terrible, like something from a gas station. It has the strongest and worst acidic ""bite"" to it, I don't know how any creature could tolerate putting it in their mouth. I had used peanut butter in previously purchased Kong's with my dog before, which is inexpensive, natural and my dog loves it, but not with this recent purchase. One snif, and he ignores it permanently. The smell/taste did not wash or wear away after several months, but did start to decompose inside. Anyone with a Kong for a longer duration can tell you how the rubber starts to melt. This one started to do that in under 6 months of NO USE. ""Fill"" a natural hollow cow bone with peanut butter, and give that to your dog. That's my recommendation, anyway. I would consider buying a kong again if they reformulated the material to not have a toxic smell or taste."
4,Dog seems to like it once in awhile.,"I bought this because it seemed that so many people said their dog loved this toy. Well, my dog does like to play with it once in awhile but it has to have a treat inside. After some time he figured out that by dropping the toy a bunch of times the treat will break apart and fall out of the hole. Once the treat is gone, he's done playing with it."
5,Legendary For A Reason,"I'm quite sure that my dog - a large Border Collie mix - loves his Kong more than he loves me. I fill it with peanut butter and let him spend a happy hour slurping it out; I stuff a large treat inside and watch him puzzle over how to free it; I simply throw and bounce it around for him to chase. It's funny looking and a little hard to clean (though it does go in the dishwasher!), but it's pure doggie joy, and at a great price. If my dog ever manages to chew this one up, he'll get another."
4,Nice treat toy,This is a nice chew toy for small dog breeds...perfect for mine. He loves playing with it to find his hidden treasure.
2,"Won't hold kibble, only squirt can stuff","It might work well with moist dog food that would stick to the sides but not for dry as it simply all falls out. The opening for the small size dog is large enough for large dog kibble even though the product wouldn't be able to hold more than a few pieces that size. Since we have a small dog, we tried small dog kibble. Fail. The packaging specifically says insert treats (plural) but the picture shows squirting stuff. If you get it, stick with squirting stuff."
5,best dog toy ever,"My dog chewed everything, including my sofa, camera, husbands glasses, three remote controls, nothing worked until the director of our local no kill shelter Friends for Animals told me about kongs, she has not chewed anything since and she always has a kong in her mouth"
5,Pet chews and food dispenser,Excellent for new puppies. Recommended by a leading dog trainer. I would definately order these again before I brought a new puppy home. They not only dispense food but it is a good toy expecially for chewing.
5,Kong,My dogs love their kongs...but what dog wouldn't love something that has a treat inside for them to eat. I would recommend this to anyone who owns a dog or dogs.
5,Indestructable!,I have a pit bull that has torn through every pit bull proof and super strong toy I have provided except this one. He loves it when I fill it with Peanut Butter (keeps him busy for a while). Great toy though 2 thumbs up!
4,Treats got stuck in,"It is a good product,and my dog liked it from the first moment,but the sample treat that came with it,went into the hole,and we couldn't get it out"
5,My Pug's Addiction,"I ordered the Kong for my daughter's dog for Christmas and she loves it so I decided to order one for our pug and she is crazy about the thing. Even though she is three years old, I can't believe how much she chews on the toy even without peanut butter in it. I bought the Kong peanut butter to start with but now am using regular peanut butter. Whatever room she is in, she brings the Kong with her. This would have been a great toy when she was a puppy and chewing constantly."
5,Great to keep dogs busy,These keep the dogs busy and out of trouble in the critical first few minutes after we leave the house. They sometimes last for as many as 12 hours depending how skillyfully you stuff them. They are easy to wash although the inside part is difficult to reach completely.
4,Lab likes it,"I have a 5 mo-old lab mix. He has a number of toys and enjoys playing with the Kong Classic, especially when there is some sort of treat inside. He has chewed up a number of other toys, but the Classic is still holding strong! The odd shape keeps him entertained while he is swatting and chasing it. My lab is a strong chewer and this product has stood up to all my dog can dish out.I would definitely recommend this product to a friend, especially for someone with a strong chewer. I gave it 4 out of 5 because the treats sold by Kong to put in the Classic do not stay in very well. My dog had the treat out within minutes."
4,Strong but not a favorite,"I have this toy in a few sizes and colors. It's not my dog's favorite toy but when I smear a teaspoon of peanut butter or cream cheese in it, he loves it to pieces.He is a very aggressive chewer and the Kongs hold up to his King Kong jaws but I don't think he's a big hard rubber fan. He likes soft things that squeak when bitten...like my toes. ;) Still, the Kong is a good distraction while the humans eat dinner or when he has to sit in his crate or in the car.I definitely recommend stuffing it with something to hold the appeal for finicky pups."
4,Not too shabby,"I purchased this toy for my Rottweiler puppy 7 months ago when he was about 3 months old. He is now a year old and finally managed to destroy this toy. However, it did say on the product that it was for average chewers. My puppy is not an average chewer, he is an extremely powerful chewer...so at least it lasted for a few months. It actually lasted longer than I thought it would. I will now be purchasing the extreme version of this toy for strong chewers and see how it holds up."
3,KONG CLASSIC DOG TOY - LARGE,The hole is very large so very difficult to find anything that doesn't fall out easily. Other than that it is a very strong rubber type dog toy that would be fairly indestructible.
1,This toy hurt my dog,"My poor Lab is still recovering from her bad experience with this toy. I bought a Kong just like this and filled it with treats for my sweet 3 year old rescue Lab. I followed all the instructions, but still, within minutes, her nose was bleeding and all the skin on the top part of her nose had been scraped off. I guess she stuck her nose in there to investigate, just like a dog would, and then all the skin on her nose got scraped off. I took the toy away from her as soon as I noticed. There was blood all over her dog bed. That was over 2 months ago, and her sweet little nose still hasn't healed properly.I mentioned this whole fiasco to my sister-in-law, and she said that her dog cut up his nose, too, on this exact same toy in the exact same way. Buyer beware--what seems like something nice for your doggie may actually really hurt him."
4,Favorite dog brand,"My dog has lost (or possibly buried) the original Kong I bought her, so this was purchased as a replacement. She absolutely adores it."
3,"It""s just ok","I was hoping my Spitz would like it, but he doesn't he barely plays with it. I even tried putting peanut butter in it. he gets the peanut butter out and that's it."
5,Keeps the pup busy while I'm away,I love this product. It helps keep my puppy busy while I'm away at work. Every pet owner should own one of these.
1,Beware - Extremely Dangerous,My boykin spaniel (45 lbs.) chewed the top off (size large) and swallowed it. Cost $1000 to have the pieces surgically removed from her intestines and stomach. Vet said this was the 3rd dog she had to operate on for removal of this toy. That's just one vet. Would have rated it zero if that was an option.
1,Bad choice for big dog.,We have black kongs and love them but constantly step on them and roll our ankles. So we thought the red ones would be easier to see. We just assumed they were all indistructible. They are not. Our pit bull had chewed the red ones completely up in a matter of hours. Our bad. But we really didn't know there was a difference.
5,I Love Kong!,I love the Classic Kong Dog toy. My new dog that suffers from Separation Anxiety and seems nervous most of the time loves to get the treats out of the Kong! It is great! I can't wait to get the Kong Bone I just ordered.. because he LOVES to nibble/chew on things.. I am hoping that he will love the bone as much as he does the Classic Kong Toy!
3,Loved it initially.,"I was so excited when I first got this toy and my dogs would be entertained for hours. However, once they found out the trick to get the treat out,they did so instantly and abandoned the kong completely. I rarely use it anymore as they are just too smart for it."
5,Best dog toy,"This is the best of a raft of toys I've bought for our two dogs. They love playing with it and it keeps them occupied for an hour or more at a time. And it's completely durable and easy to wash.One warning - the ""small"" toy is very, very small, meant more for a toy dog than a regular small dog. Even our 15-pound dog plays fine with the medium, so I recommend that one for most small-to-medium dogs."
1,Not Puppy proof,"This lasted all of 2 minutes with my puppy. I would never buy this again. They say this is for an average chewer. If that's the case then I must have a ""chewer"" that is off the charts! I'm looking for advice on what really is a durable dog toy that will hold up to a puppy."
2,Disappearing Kong,My 12-pound MinPin ate the top part off of a small Kong. Swallowed it whole from the looks of it... And all within 10 minutes. Not too thrilled right now since I did not think she would be able to chew this up so quickly. :( Also worried about her considering the amount she ingested at once.
2,Border Collie/German Shepard destruction,"My dog loved the Kong toy a little too much, and ended up ripping it to pieces. I always thought the kong toys were so durable, but apparently not for my puppy Border Collie/German Shep. she chewed right through it. Never leave them alone with the toy, and do not allow them to chew on it like a bone."
3,Big Chewer doesn't choose Kong!,My dog is an anbitious chewer...but he doesn't care for the Kong toy. Maybe he just wants something that is more easily destroyed...lol!
5,Awesome,"Great product, great price. Fill this toy with peanut butter and you have a happy dog for half an hour. It is great. Can't beat the price on here either."
2,"Love anything that keeps my Husky busy, even if it is only for a few minutes","Love the concept! Brilliant, who would have thought toy+peanut butter= happy dog. My active little Husky enjoyed this toy but it was too small for him :( He is on the small side for his breed so I thought medium would suffice this toy was way too small, I should have purchased an extra large. I was so excited to give it to him that I didn't want to waste the time on a return. He loved it the first couple times but he hasn't been into it since. I am really considering purchasing the large!"
3,Two weeks later and nothing,"I'm sure this is a great product, however, it's been two weeks and my dogs haven't chewed on it or played with it. There was even a treat smothered with peanut butter stuck inside. One of my dogs just licked all the peanut butter out, left the treat inside, and neither dog has touched it since. It sits there all alone and unused. My dogs seem to prefer rawhides over anything else. I bought it to see if they would like something different but I guess I was wrong. It does have a weird, chemical, gas kind of smell to it so maybe that's one reason they don't care for it? Guess I'll stick to rawhides and other chew toys. I really hoped they would like it. Oh well!"
5,My dog loves them,I freeze various things inside and I know my dog loves them when he is in his kennel if I'm gone.
4,Good toys,"My two dogs like these, but they're a little big for my pugs - they can't quite reach the end. Easy to clean out though. I started freezing them, and they seem to like it - especially in the summer."
2,Small Kong Dog toy,This product did not hold up to the puppy teeth. Perhaps I should have purchased the medium Kong. I am disappointed.
5,I wouldn't have a dog without having a few of these.,"All four (yes, four) of my dogs love these. My two little dogs get their entire breakfast in one and my bigger dogs get a portion of their breakfast in their Kongs. My dogs are crate-trained, so I like having something for them to work on while we're away at work. It stimulates them and makes them work, which makes your dog happy. Don't hesitate for a second to get one of these. I use Natural Balance dog food rolls (great for training--dogs love it) to stuff the Kongs with, or sometimes, I will fill them with their dry food and a couple of treats, seal it off with peanut butter and freeze overnight. There are also recipes on the Kong website, I believe."
2,Not what I expected...,"My 10 year old Weimaraner has recently been diagnosed with Mast Cell Tumors, he has undergone surgery twice and luckily all have been Grade 1 (least likely to be malignant). My vet wanted to start him on Prednisone and Tagament in an effort to keep additional tumors from forming. The Prednisone has caused some loss of muscle mass on the top of his head and around the jaw line. I was hoping this toy would encourage him to exercise those muscles, but his quickly looses interest in it (even when it is stuffed full of treats). He gets out what he can, but he couldn't have done much to this toy when he was younger. It is very tough, I'll give it that, in fact I believe it is too strong. Once the treats are in it, it is almost impossible to get them out unless you can manage to squeeze the toy together, which was what I was hoping he could do.Perhaps I expected too much."
3,Not a big fan of Kong,"My dog rarely plays with this and doesn't find it interesting...at all.I feel like Kong over promises and under delivers. They say all the time that their toys are ""indestructible."" My dog has destroyed some of their products in short times, like less than a day.They claim their products challenge dogs but I find that they routinely create products with holes that are too small to accept treats easily and are too large to use for kibble.They have a huge reputation but I think it's hype. Don't believe it!"
1,not worth the money,"I bought this as a toy to entertain my medium sized dog. It took her all of 20 seconds to clean it out and then look at me like ""now what"". She is not really a chewer but I thought maybe if she had to work for a treat it would break up the boredom of being home alone while I work. Even with the paste it was no challenge at all."
1,Lasted 30 minutes.,"After searching the shelves for a strong dog toy, I came across this KONG with a picture of a cute Lab on it. I bought the Kong for my 1yr old Lab who instinctively loves to chew. After about 30 minutes she managed to chew off the smaller end into tiny chunks of rubber just big enough for my son to choke on.I think I'll try a crowbar for the next dog toy."
2,doesn't live up to the hype,My dog (80 lbs.) liked this toy when it contained a treat but within a week it was beginning to come apart so I threw it away. Maybe she needed the black kong.
5,Great durable toy!,We got this for our big dog. She's a real chewer and we were concerned if this toy would really last for her. These Kong toys are great and REALLY durable. She's been chewing hard on this for a long time now and hasn't been able to begin to tear it yet!
4,Nice toy for snacks!,Dog loves her snacks in it and food too! She will play for a long time with it. Great item!
4,good price,have these in my local pet store for a bit more cost so was pleased to find this one for my son's dog who had outgrown the smaller size.
2,Javon can do so much better.,"It makes me sad to hear a great musician like Javon Jackson producing music like this. I just saw Javon in concert last night with Benny Green and Carl Allen and he can tear it up! Unfortunately, that's not what's happening on this disk. I understand that he is trying to reach a larger audience and I know it's difficult to make money playing jazz, but I really don't think playing this smooth R&B stuff is the answer. He would really be better off producing funk-fusion albums in the category of Freddie Hubbard's Red Clay."
2,Where's Pete Rivera (Hoorbleke)?,"If you loved the sound of the original Rare Earth as much as I have, don't waste your money on this. Sounds like a group of knock-offs trying to pass themselves off as Rare Earth, WITHOUT Pete. They need to get him back on drums, or at least on vocals, and record a concert for DVD. THAT I would buy. Not bad audio and video, but not the Rare Earth I saw at Portland's Memorial Coliseum with the Doobie Brothers in the winter of 1972-73... I too miss Guzman, as a previous reviewer mentioned. Any way of talking Pete to make a one-time concert appearance with the rest of the surviving members of the band?"
2,Not the Real Thing-where are the Original players?,The video has a good picture and sound quality but it does not sound like Rare Earth to me--not without the original players--especially the original drummer who was also the lead singer--now that is Rare Earth--no mistaking Peter's voice--without him or any other original players (from what I can see) this is just an average copy band----take your chances.
3,Too thin for painting -- paint seeps through,"These are two thin for use as a painting dropcloth. If you don't double it over, the pain seeps through to the floor. I subsequently purchased on dropcloth from my local paint shop, and it was many times thicker -- allowing for its intended use."
2,too thin,"too thin, paint goes right through,was using it on the floor. It's pretty long but if you buy this you'd have to get more than one"
5,Great book!,"This book really intrigued me when I read it at only ten years old. It tells the story of three brothers, two of which build the sand castle, and one who thinks deeper than the sand. Claudelle goes and finds seashells to look up the names of in his books in his room when he gets back from the beach. Then Mary Stolz (the author) describes the sea life living around them. It is very interesting and teaches you a lot for a book with less than 50 pages. It has great illustrations by Susan Gallagher that help tell the story. Overall a great book for a fifth-sixth grader. And even now, at 16, 6 years later, I can still read it and be affected. Great book."
2,Garbage,- Caused my system to lock up frequently.- Security Center is nothing more than a tool to try to get you to buy more software.- Internet Explorer integration is buggy.
2,Trash,- Locks up system.- Security Center is nothing more than a marketing tool to try to get you to buy more software.- Buggy integration with IE.- Cannot view blocked e-mails in e-mail program. Even at lowest setting it incorrectly identifies too many e-mails as spam.
1,Very disappointed,"We bought this to ""protect"" ourselves on the internet. After we download according to the easy to follow directions, we found out that we could not even log on to our internet server. We did not have another computer to access the ""internet technical support."" When we wanted to call for phone support, they wanted to charge us $39 for their service or $2.95 per minute of service. We were extremely disappointed. We'll buy Norton next time."
1,Worse than any virus ever created!,"This product nearly destroyed my computer. Even basic desktop functions disappeared--no icons, no taskbar. Blue screens...name your worst nightmare...this product is it.McAfee website Help is No Help. I tried the $2.95 a minute route, and couldn't get through.McAfee's Uninstall program failed mid-way, and wouldn't re-run.Ultimately, I paid a computer consultant $270 to remove this trash from my computer.I was testing this crashware because I approve software purchases for my company. Believe me, no McAfee product will EVER be purchased by my company again."
1,STAY AWAY,This software came installed on my new pc. Almost everytime I went on the internet my pc crashed completely. The error message I got clearly said that the problem was in McAfee. I called Dell Support and they told me that they get many calls from people experiencing the same problem. They told me my pc was crashing because I needed to download the upgrade. I did this. Everything was okay for the next few times I got on the internet. Within a week my pc crashed again with the same error. I finally had to remove the software from my pc. It has been working fine every since. I'm now going to buy Norton.
1,Popups and then some,"The last thing I want from a product is more popups containing ""partner advertisements."" This is not the biggest complaint...the product is too difficult to use...and then I come back to the thing about mcafee partner advertisement popupwindows. give me a break. It's very similar to having Quicktime in the system tray - how do you get rid of that?!!?"
1,Don't Buy Yet,Too many bugs. Slows machine -- even running XP with Cable Internet & 384MB RAM. The Spam Killer does not effectively integrate with Outlook. Had to frequently shut down the privacy service to access anything. Had to do multiple installs to get product initially running with all features. Very disappointing.
1,Avoid This,"Signed up for cable internet and installed this product for protection on my WIN98SE machine. Install went fine but multiple fatal errors, freezes and shutdowns everyday since. Seems to be major conflicts with the Privacy Service component, especially when I try to run Musicmatch Jukebox. Crashes almost everytime unless I disable Privacy Service. Also, you have to log in everytime you restart your system and takes at least three times as long to load up when the system starts. I actually went ahead and bought a new computer and I plan on using Norton products on that system!"
3,"Some problems, but better than Norton","The problems:(1) Outlook Express cannot successfully download email from a POP3 account unless SpamKiller and Privacy Service are disabled.(2) Privacy service flags pages based on ""keywords"" and so gets lots of false positives.(3) The firewall doesn't listen when you tell it ""don't ask me about this program again.""The plusses:(1) It installed OK. I couldn't get Norton Internet Security to install at all.(2) AntiVirus works great."
1,Do not buy this software,"When I first installed McAfee, I had problems with it already. The program will not install in my computer. So I contacted their Tech Support via their webpage. One out four Technical Chat Support I contacted, only one of them was able to help me. (They charge to speak to Tech Support via phone). I've only had the software for one week, but it always has some issues popping up, i.e. One of the four programs not installed or updated, computer crashes, etc. After I've finally updated all the program then another problem came up, The Spamkiller and Firewall that is included on this software had conflicted with my outlook express which caused me to not be able to receive e-mails from outlook. This software is a waste of time and money. I'am now uninstalling it from my computer. Please do some research first before buying anything especially computer software."
2,Startup Error,"I am currently running Mcafee Security suite on my laptop. It is a/has Dell, P4, 3.2g, 768MB RAM, 60G, XP Home. When I log into windows I have to enter my mcafee admin password. When I click login it takes me thru the register/setup form. When I complete the setup it tells me that I am already registered and then starts the whole register process over. It does this each time I start my computer. Also, if I try to update the product it starts the redundant register process all over. The tech support from Mcafee has been marginal at best, while the Dell support tech said ""you might need to call somebody"". The product does an excellent job of managing cookies and in and outgoing connections. The Security Suite has a lot of potential if they could just work the bugs out OR hire better support personel."
1,Totally Disappointed,I upgraded from viruscan pro 7 to this and it was nothing but headaches for me. I did clean installs several times as per technical support but privacy service and spam killer would slow my system to a crawl then I'd watch my cpu temps climb as it just sat there and got slower and slower. I can't reccomend this product.. and I was always a big fan of Mcafee. looks like I'm going back to my old version until they get some issues resolved. The forums on their site are bubbling with complaints
1,Requires constant subscription verification,"This software needs to ""phone home"" often. When it does you need to enter your username and password. It disables itself until it has verified your subscription. Their anti-piracy measures interfere with paying customers. I'm not happy with this program and when my subscription expires I'll be looking for a different solution. Their website is terrible. It's full of ""partner pop-up ads"", and the customer feedback doesn't work. Use something (anything) else..."
1,"Garbage, just garbage!","McAfee must like losing customers who put down their hard earned cash buying their products. After all, they've burned so many of us! Perhaps this is their version of a financial ""Wham, bam, thank you ma'am?""While I could go into a plethora of gory details as to how their software and lack of meaningful support wasted many hours of my time, patience, and money, I will simply say that after exhausting every other possibility as to what could be causing my Hotmail and Microsoft Office Update problems (which were bizarre, to say the least) were all attributed to this piece of garbage from McAfee - Internet Security Suite 2004. After removing this Typhoid Mary from both my new computers, all my other programs worked perfectly.Shame on you McAfee, you've lost the trust of many of your former customers who've now taken their business elsewhere."
1,Ditto to the other reviews--DON'T buy this defective product,"I have never written a review for any other product. I have never had problems and lack of service like this for any other product. The only reason I gave it one star rating is there is no option for zero stars.I am used to occasional problems from software. I have experienced a bug at times from others. Never anything like this.I'll save you the time by not repeating all the complaints others have written. Just believe me, they are true."
1,Do Not Buy This Product!!!!,"Do not buy this product if you expect to receive any support for problems that may arise. I purchased the product and tried to install it on my computer, however, the VirusScan component would not install. To speak with a represenative costs $2.95 a minute. Additionally, you have to really search their website to find the phone numbers or email addresses. I emailed my problem (the only choice available for free support on their malfunctioning product)and received incomplete directions (days later) on how to solve it which caused me to have to uninstall and reinstall XP. I would have given this product no stars had the option been available."
1,"Horrible product, DO NOT BUY.","I should have listened to the other reviews, but I didn't. I installed this junk, and now it has messed everything up. I can't get onto the internet (i'm using a friends right now). It won't let me fully un-intall it. Tried Tech support over the phone, to talk to someone live is 2.50 a minute, and they're no help what so ever. It has been a nightmare since I installed it, I wish I never did. My internet techs tried everything to help me, but have failed. They're final suggestion is to re-boot computer, looks like that's my next step. Thanks Mcafee for a complete disaster. Never again. This junk doesn't deserve 1 star, but that's the lowest I could give. This product is NOT recommended what-so-ever."
1,MacAfiasco 2006 V8,"I thought I was alone with having trouble with MacAfee . I have just tried MacAfee Internet Security Suite 2006 V8 which I assumed would have removed the previous problems. Oh how wrong can you be. After installation I rebooted and Generic Host failed, resulting in all sorts of things going wrong including inability to access webpages and email. So, to get MacAfee's help I had to uninstall.I spent 13 hours and 11 long-winded sessions with tech Chat resulting in back to square one i.e. uninstall. Even their two promised e-mailed resolutions never turned up. And every tech help session required me to reboot resulting in being chopped off , so there was no continuity.I concluded that if 11 MacAfee trained Techies couldn't sort it out in 11 hours, then fat chance that I could.But, perhaps on some PCs it will sail through and work perfectly, perhaps you'll be lucky. And if you are, you'll read this and say 'what are you on about - its great'.Suggestion: Look for an alternative."
1,Plain and Simple - Stinks,"I was reluctant when I purchased this. however, since there aren't too many alternatives I decided to buy it. You should believe every negative comment you read about this McAfee product. I installed it on my Dell with windows xp. pROBLEMS TOO NUMEROUS TO EVEN GET INTO. I emailed customer support over a week ago and have still not received a response. I tried calling but its expensive. My computer keeps crashing and freezing up, something which never happened before. I think the only reason why this product might sell is because there isnt too much competition. HOwever, I would recommend seriously checking out the Micro Trend product or Norton's before jumping at this. IT really does STINK!!!!!"
1,Very disappointed,"If you don't want to access Google or check your e-mail, then this is what you want. Hint: Use the custom install and forget the spamkiller and the privacy service if you want Google and Outlook Express to work. It can't find the server!The virus scan and the firewall are all you need. The rest is a waste of time and money.I'm going back to Norton next year, maybe sooner."
1,Nothing But TROUBLE!!!!,I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this product. I've had nothing but trouble with my computer since the installation. My computer wouldn't shut down properly. It crashes several times a day with the blue screen of death. I finally uninstalled Internet Security Suite. I'm still getting the blue screen of death. I never had any problems with my computer before this. I think I would have been better off getting a virus!!
1,Last time going to use a McAfee product,"After experiencing many hangups, crashes, and overall slower computer speed, I removed this product from my computer. After removing AcAfee from my computer I still experienced problems. I needed to remove a ton a MaAfee lines from my registry that the uninstall program failed to remove and swore to never fall victim to MeAfee (3 time using a variation of a security suite). My son's computer had similar problems until I removed and cleaned McAfee from his computer."
4,"good overall product, best major marketed AV product avail.","Overall very good product for personal AV productA safer bet than TM or Symantec, which seem to have fumbled, as much as I like Trend Micro...(refer to my other 2 reviews of AV 50ph7\/\/4|23)it's been great btchng @ the world...thanksZ"
3,Surfing on a brick,"Hi, I've been trying IS6 now for 2 months, and have found it very hard work. It works well as a Firewall, antivirus, but the Security Center & Spamkiller are c**p. The security center has to keepbeing turned off all the time and thats going to safe, decent sites, the spamkiller works on rules, which are not the hardest thing for spammers to break, so 90% gets through. I dont know whether its my configuration but I have had to uninstall Privacy Center, and use Cloudmark Spamnet for anti-spam.One example is security center doesnt work with remote desktop, so you have to go to the remote dektop and switch of SC before connecting.I wish I had gone for Norton Security"
1,DO NOT WORK,"I tried to install this product on a dell computer which came with a trial version. I uninstalled the trial version which had been expired before I install this new one. This product is total confused with the dell trial version and refused to allow me to update anything.Called and emailed McAfee and their rep acknowledged that my receipt and I have a new version of legal copy. However, their web site still shows my registration is expired and no updates are allowed. Their rep told me to register using different email address. The problem is no matter how many time I try to install and uninstall it, it never asks me to register again. Since the virus definition are not updated, this product is virtuall useless at all.Do not ""UPGRADE"" this product from previous version. You will waste your time and money because they want you to renew it online so they can make more money from you."
1,Very poor product at best,Don not buy this product. It is a nightmare to install and maintain. I had to uninstall it twice and then 3 days after finally getting it to work it says the privacy component has expired! Theres no support unless you pay $2.95 a minute or you email them you life history to get email support. I just gave up and crossed McAfee off my product 'buy' list for home and work.I have now reinstalled older alternative product I was using for the past two years that has free virus updates forever and the bets bit....it works!If you use this product the DAT files are only good for one year and it secures you PC so you can't get into it if it screws up.In short don't waste you money on this useless product. Bad move by a greedy McAfee.
3,Extractors,I only use one of the tools and it works. I have no idea how to properly use the others since there were not detailed directions.
2,It came but with 2 and 1 Incomplete..,"the ""Body Toolz Facial Skin Care Set"" item package, it looks like it was opened and it had some of the items displayed in the image missing. Had a total of 6 in the image display but it gave me 2 and 1 incomplete one. I don't know if it was Amazon's fault or the person who gave it to them.. I'm thinking it's the people who made the items since all these reviews are giving the bad feedback, Be lucky people you got all the tools (that you don't know how to use lol) when they gave me only 2 and a 3rd one without the lace or anything on it.. Literally. I haven't used it yet but just putting that out there, you could probably search at Walgreens or somewhere to get these products altogether for probably cheaper. You ATLEAST SEE what you're buying there.I don't know how to upload the images so I did it this way - [...]"
2,Not so sure about the quality,I can only use one of them.Quality is very poor...I would recommend to invest little more money and get a better quality so you can actually use them and keep them for a long time.
1,low in quality,"This is a set of low quality tool. The surfaces of the tools are rough and scratched my skin. I will not use it on anyone's skin again. Most people only need the one with loop on both ends, which can be found in general store for less than $2 with high quality."
4,Exactly what's on the picture.,"I can't tell how good or bad these compared to other comedone extractors, but I can say that they're very sturdy, you get exactly what's on the picture and they work well. When you get the one that has removable heads, they heads IN the handle, you have just unscrew them and flip them. I got what I paid for, and I like them."
5,"""A must READ!!"",""Why did I wait? I can't put it down!""","Where do I begin to praise this book? It is a great asset to my aviation Library & like cream it rises to the top of my aviation collection!! I'am X-Navy Vietnam who spent many months on & around aircraft carriers, Enterprise CVn-65.

Isby for your shared passion of mine & Amazon.Com for ease & confort to increase my passion ""Military Aviation""!!Rodney K. AKA HotRod"
4,Great Book For Young Enthusiasts,"The targeted audience for this book was a little below my interest level. But this would be an excellent book for a child or young teen interested in the Hornet. It has lots of photos, illustrations, even details the Hornet Pilot's flight gear."
3,"Basically good, but could have used better proofreading","Overall, this is a pretty good read. Lots of good pictures, especially of USMC Hornets, which don't always get coverage. However, the author (or maybe the editor) mis-labels a few pictures,there are several noticeable typos, & a couple of places where the info is questionable (do you REALLY want to arm the ejection seat before you strap in?) These problems wouldn't be worth mentioning if it weren't for the fact that for the most part this is an excellent book, especially for the layman aviation enthusiast!"
3,Impressive solo debut,"The 2006 release Demented Honour is the debut solo album from singer/guitarist Erol Sora, who had previously worked with Uriah Heep's John Lawton. With Demented Honour, Sora delivers a solid helping of melodic rock songs, similar in nature (and quality) to bands like Lost Weekend and Crown of Thorns. It's a fairly straightforward melodic rock album with some bluesier elements. This is Sora's first outing as a vocalist, and he gives a surprisingly good performance.Demented Honor may not make anyone's top 10 lists, but it is still a very solid album, and one that few AOR fans will regret buying (though perhaps not at Amazon's high import price). If you're the kind of person who often buys albums on the Frontiers, AOR Heaven, or MTM labels (and you probably are if you're checking out this album listing), chances are you'll like what you hear on Demented Honor."
3,A Perfect Disappointment,"I like a special type of book when I'm commuting. The plot should have plenty of action, the sillier and more predictable the better. The characters should be easily identifiable and two-dimensional (one-dimensionable is even better). In short, the book should distract me without really keeping me from paying attention to the road. This book was perfect.So why was I disappointed? The description of the novel on the back of the case said that after her husband's death, Nell begins to suspect ""fowl play."" There were no chickens in the book. I felt cheated."
5,Absolutely chilling--and Rove is just one of the hit-men,"Reading about Rove's contempt for fair play from the beginning of his career is absolutely chilling. The book is even-handed and meticulous, but presents so many cases where he damaged lives, careers and democracy with his political ruthlessness.What's frightening is how much influence he has on Bush today, and the fact that he isn't the only Lee Atwater disciple wielding power in the current Republican Party. Read David Brock's Blinded By the Light for a complementary tale of manipulation and dissembling.This book was obviously completed before the Republican ads that defeated Senator Max Cleland by calling him unpatriotic, even though Cleland had lost two legs and an arm in Vietnam--but that approach only buttresses the core points I take from this powerful book: The bullying tactics of people like Rove need to themselves become a political issue, because they represent a direct attack on our democracy.Paul LoebAuthor Soul of a Citizen"
1,Bush's Brain,I didn't realize that they would put a more appropriate title on a book of blank pages.
1,"They made me give them a star, when the truth was zero","What a bunch of typical negative, unsupported liberal hogwash. If you guys come up with ANY ideas that might be useful to deal with the country's issues, please let us know. It might be good that the ideas do not include the old ones: soak the rich, income distribution disguised as being nice to people (that is giving away my money, not yours, to someone that I do not know nor have any responsibility for), world government where we have to ask the freakin' French ""Mother May-I"" each time, etc..Do you have any idea how out of touch you are?? Does it matter to you??Go to****"
1,Another typical Hit Job on Bush,"You might as well save time and watch Keith Olberman than read this book. It is a typical hit job by the press. Don't waste your time or money, there are much better books out there that are far more balanced in the coverage."
1,Bush's Brain No More,Looks like Turd Blossom is going to jail for outing a covert CIA operative. See ya Karl!
3,Almost Good: Stop after 15!!!!!!,"The first 15 chapters of this book are well documented and well-written. The book flows well and gives an incredible inside look into the political landscape of Texas. That is until the last 2 chapters. It becomes obvious, that the liberal authors get more and more frustrated by the fact of the conclusions before them, that they have to reveal their true contempt for 2 men (Rove and Bush). They go so far as to predict the death of tens of thousands of US soldiers in Iraq--good call boys!! Instead of using the picture of a leader of character to sell your next book, why don't you first admit you were wrong, give credit where it is due, and give me my $...back. I let you keep the change for the first 15 chapters. You loathe these leaders because by definition a leader has character and strategy. They exemplify both, and you can't handle that"
2,Frightening if True!,"Well written and presents a frightening thought that our current President could be as easily manipulated as he is, and between the lines there is a clear picture that ""Dubya"" really is as dumb, or God help us, dumber than we think he is. That Karl Rove has any power and a place in the West Wing should scare the bejeepers out of anyone who really cares what goes on behind closed doors."
3,he's too much of an insider to talk about bush,"This book does a really job detailing Karl Rove's character and the scandals that he has been involved in. If you want information about bush, read another book. The author goes ridiculously easy on bush, most likely because he does not want to jeopardize his access to the president."
2,undeserved praise,"I strongly dislike Mr. Rove, and was hoping for even more evidence to bolster my opinion.The book opens with a hymn of praise for Mr. Rove's skill at dirty tricks. No details, just endlessly repeated generalisations and evaluations. It is creepy. Is this tongue in cheek, or do the authors really dig corruption?The authors beat around the Bush, and can't seem to get on with it. I am tempted to give up on it. However, I will slog through a few more chapters to see if the pace picks up."
4,The ghost in the machine,"Given the fact that a very large number of people seem to regard George W. Bush as 'brainless' - this book really ought to be listed under fiction - or perhaps, horror stories."
2,Interesting but biased,"I enjoyed this book. It's entertaining and worth reading. At times the book is repetitious. (I kept saying, ""OK, you've already written that 3 times. Who is editing this?"") The lowest point in the book is when the authors, after exposing Rove's faults, praise (of all people) Tareq Aziz for making an anti-Israel and anti-Bush statement, thus revealing their own bias. This one outrageous comment, along with the authors' dire predicitons for Iraq, makes me wonder how slanted the rest of the book is. We know Rove has an agenda; it's too bad we have to read more than 200 pages before we discover this book's real agenda: get Bush by trashing Rove. Still, the book is an addition to the debate over the role of political consultants in the Presidency."
4,The Beginning Of Starfleet,"This novel by veteran Star Trek writer Diane Carey is based upon the first 'Star Trek: Enterprise' episode, Broken Bow. It lays the foundation for the formation of Starfleet, which of course came before 'The United Federation Of Planets', and includes some events leading up to the aquisition of warp technology (this book is more detailed than the television version) including a bit more about Zephran Cochran, the inventor of warp drive on earth. This is really fascinating stuff. The plot and storyline are good, as is character development, required reading for any serious Star Trek fan. This book also goes into some detail concerning the start of Vulcan-Terran cooperation and mutual trust and respect, very interesting coverage here. This is great science fiction on any standard, well worth reading, written in an easy to read, flowing style."
4,Broken Bow a MUST for Star Trek fans,"This book is basically the pilot novelized, with just a bit more. As usual, it doesn't wander too much from what was on TV, but it adds enough to be a great read for fans! From attitudes towards the Vulcans to 'insider' information on the origins of Star Fleet, this bring enough to the table to be a great book! If you're a fan of Star Trek, or just beginning with Enterprise on UPN, this is worth the price of a hard cover book! Highly Recommended!!"
5,Enterprise Broken Bow,"Enterprise: Broken BowThis book is not unlike the Season Premeire Movie Broken Bow, however there is a bit more detail and the characters seem to come alive in a much better form within its pages.We also get a glimpse into what the writers and producers were and are expecting with the Enterprise series in the Concept Log that has been bound with the story."
1,Don't think it's Japanese,"I bought this video because as a Japanese, I want to know something about Karate in my workout. But this video was total disappointment to me. The studio is decorated in some misterious oriental taste unnecessarily, but don't think it's Japanese style! The moves are too quick to follow and not like Karate I know of."
5,Awesome way to stay in shape,"Good exercise program, and Lisa Gaylord is a gorgeous instructor who knows her stuff."
4,Gotta Love this game!,I am hoping to find a reasonable Spin Doctor Package & if not I am willing to try one that is priced right. Just learned this game and everything is so high to play but I really enjoy it. I'd just love to see that reverse spin that you see on T.V. and my short game is getting better. I also would pick up a Taylor Made Superfast Burner TP if there is one priced right. Hope someone can help. Thanks and Happy New Year to all!
5,The Real Deal,"Oden has captured the beauty, the incredibly hard work and the deep fear that all roils together to make boxing, especially white collar boxing, the great experience and sport it is. If you've ever been in a white collar match, you know he's caught the whole thing: the physicality, the love, the pain, the joy. If you've never fought, Oden will be your inspiration. Great book."
4,Very Nice,"When I was little, my great aunt had been traveling somewhere (can't remember where), and someone gave her a tin of violet mints. I'm not sure if these are the same brand, but she offered me a few and I've always remembered them. They did come in a little tin and they were round and smooth, as these are.The taste is slightly violet and a little sweet. In the middle there is a very tiny bit of licorice. It takes a while to get there though. Unless you have teeth like rocks, do not crunch down on these. You have to be patient.I'm glad I found them."
5,Vincent meets a woman whose book has strengthened him.,"On Halloween (Samhain) the one night a year when Vincent can walk ""our"" world in relative safety, he attends a party, hoping to meet Bridgit O'Donnell, a writer whom he admires. There, Catherine sees him, and follows he and Bridgit when they leave, which sets in motion a chain of events both despairing and enheartening."
2,Really Good...But....,"Yes this book has some really good info on the subject, but, its written for citizens of the UK or Australia! All numbers and references are for pounds and British agencys and such. Any ideas of a similar book focusing on US travelers? I can not really use this book, as such it is up for sale."
2,This book could be better organised.,"This book could do with better organisation. Same topics should be grouped together instead of mentioning them at different chapters. I also expected to see more information and suggestions on where to go. ""The Gap Year Book, 2Ed"" also published by Lonely Planet is a much better written book. You may be wiser to wait for the second edition."
4,Dreamboy,"I really enjoyed this Cd. I'm looking for the the two Cd's that ""Dreamboy"" put out. One was called ""Dreamboy"",and the other was called ""Contact""."
5,TAWATHA,"I HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR A ARTIST BY THE NAME OF TAWATHA. SHE WAS A PART OF THE R&B GROUP MTUME. THE NAME OF THE ALBUM IS ""WELCOME TO MY DREAM"" ALSO I AM LOOKING FOR A GROUP BY THE NAME OF DREAMBOY. CAN YOU HELP? THANK YOU"
5,Excellence!!!!,"First, of all I would like to say that this is an excellend compilation cd of love jams it contains some powerful classic ballads such as Superwoman, Hold Me, Love Don't Live Here Anymore, Throught The Fire, Can't Get Over You, I want To Be Your Man, Baby I'm For real, Dinner For Two, and I Promise I Do Love You, one of my all time classic favorites by(Dreamboy) you never really hear his name but he had some real nice songs and I liked them and enjoyed them I enjoy this whole cd the whole album is great and I would reccommend this album to anyone who likes classic slow jams!!!!"
3,"Not Bad, Unless You Want Quality","This works really well for video conferencing, interviews, and random webcam activity, but if you're looking for quality, save your money. The rating is inflated because of how cheap this product is. It's an incredible price for a camera, but you get what you pay for."
4,book review,"havent' had a chance to read it yet, but i have listened to the audiobook, and it is very enjoyable, i really got a lot out of it, and i highly recommend."
4,"If you like patriotic, tough as nails military guys with a sensitive side, you should read this.","I found this story to be gripping from page one, which is important to me. I've put down many a book that didn't grab me early on. The characters were strong even in an untenable situation. They were necessarily drawn to each other. I loved that his military training kicked when needed. I like this author and have downloaded several more of her books. Looking forward to reading them."
4,Loved the book,"I got this book as a free download and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It had everything you would want in a romance, a dangerous situation, interesting characters, longing, steamy love making and of course mistakes, and if we are lucky a happy ending. I practically devoured the book in one day and I am looking forward to reading many more books by Laura Taylor. I definitely would recommend this book."
4,Desert rose,I read this book quickly. It was very romantic considering the situation. The sex scenes are very nice and steamy.
3,Desert Rose,It started well but degenerated into a very ordinary romance that wasn't really worth spending the time on. Somebody might enjoy it I suppose.
3,Heart-wrenchingly poignant.,"It was an accident of fate...In a war torn Middle East country, U.S. Marine Officer David Winslow was shot down and imprisoned. Nearly two months later, Emma Hamilton, a volunteer worker for a suborganization of the U.N., was thrown into the cell next to him. Separated by the prison wall, they never saw each other face-to-face. But each gave the other hope, courage & sanity to survive in a world gone mad. When the opportunity came for them to escape, they dared to believe that their love could last a lifetime."
1,Disappointed in content,II was disappointed in the content of the book. The beginning story line was good and held my interest however as the theme continued when the woman prison was later introduced it became a bit too intense and not believable that such a love could develop that quickly. It may appeal to others but it is not one I would recommend for light reading.II did not care for the sexual parts of the book. The story line was interesting as to how and why they were in prison but focus too much on their physical attachment. It is not my preference in reading material.
3,awesome,Omg it a page turner from beginning to end. it fast pace. never a slow moment. action packed. can't wait to read the next book
5,Book 3 of the series Best One Yet!,"The compassion and deep friendship from just a touch of the hand.That is just the begining.The love scenes are very steamy, but this book is so much more than that.This is so far my favorite of the series.I usually read the free ebook then move on to the next free ebook.Laura's writing captured me from book one. I decided to buy the series.So far I am not disappointed.I have noticed that in Laura's writing she does not drone on in describing thescenery. You see it, you get it. These books are a comfortable read, not too longand not too short..Thank you Laura"
5,Enjoyable!,"This is my 2nd book I have read written by Laura Taylor, and this book surely didn't disappoint me either! I read ""Intimate Strangers"" and I became a fan of Laura Taylor.In the Desert Rose Emma and David begin as strangers. They don't remain strangers for long as they NEED each other to survive the prison they have both been thrown into. l think Fate must have brought them together! But is this what David and Emma think? Or do they believe they are only friends because they're needing each other for support, courage and the strength to hold on if they are ever released?I recommend this book to anyone who loves a good romance!! It is not too long, nor too short...just enough to enjoy the story and not needing more!!!!"
4,good read,"Very good book, well written. Would certainly buy other books from this author. Great writing style and kept you interested.."
3,"Beware, these things fall apart!","I love my Cuisinart Mini and have used them for years. I find that the blades fall apart after about 1 year-18 months of use. I have even tried only hand-washing, but it is inevitable. No glue can put them back together that I have yet found...all that said, I will continue to buy the blades periodically. The low intial cost of the unit gets multiplied over the years each time I need a new blade. If you can find the mini on sale to begin with, buy 2, because the entire unit is cheaper than the replacement blade."
3,it's a blade...,What is to say...mine broke...its a sharp blade and if you have one of these grinders you need it.
2,inaccurate description.,"This lift support is OK for the cars it fits, but it does not fit '83 Escort as claimed because it has clips at both ends whereas the '83 has a bolt hole at one end. Probably it only fits the 1986-90 models."
4,It was a good CD but not as good as his others.,"Like i said it was okay, but it could have been better. His Songs are very good but are in some cases vulger when unecessary. Some other parts though are very hilarious i crack up most everytime i listen to it."
5,Great Album,THis album is hilarious. I would say that this one and THEYRE ALL GONNA LAUGH AT YOU are his best. I was listening to SHHHH....DONT TELL recently and it has its high points but isnt as complete an album as this one. If you've never heard it and you like adam sandlers movies then you need to get this. Its a classic.
3,"Much of it is ""R"" rated (in my opinion)","I bought this CD solely to listen to the ""Hypnotist"" and share the laughs with friends--it is funny and clean. However, much of the CD is a little raunchy and not for youngsters, and possibly not for mixed company. ""To each his own (taste)..."""
4,There's Some Great Comedy,"I liked this album. My friends liked this album, too. In fact, one friend has been borrowing it since December 31, 1999. I liked a lot of the comedy. There is some pretty funny material in it. Tracks 3,5,6, and 19 are the fuuniest, but they are all funny. Even the songs are funny. If you like Sandler, Chris Rock, or any comedy buy this. Trust me, it's funny."
2,2 1/2 stars because only half is good,"I like Adam Sandler. I think he is funny. So I am not an Adam Sandler basher when I say his albums aren't that good. Take every movie Adam has made and cut the number in half and you get the number of good movies he's done. The same goes with his albums. For every one classically funny skit/song there is one that is just mind-numbingly unfunny or executed poorly and slip shod. However, this is a lot better average than most of the comics out there."
3,Worth it just for the Chanukah Song,"If you are Jewish, it's worth getting just for the Chanukah song. Let's face it, Jewish holidays just aren't known for their fun easy to sing along with songs. Other than the drediel(sp) song, most people don't know any. It may not be the most tasteful song in the world but if you laughed when Jerry Seinfeld played Elijah, the prophet, on SNL, you'll love it."
3,Eh......,"This CD has its good points but does have some weak spots too. The ""Excited Southerner"" tracks sounded like filler to me. They consist of rambling that is barely understandable, something I didn't find to amusing.The opener, ""Joining the Cult,"" is an amusing track and is an okay choice to open. The next track, ""Respect"" is hillarious account of a five-year-old describing his first day of school to his grandfather.""Ode to my Car"" is another standout. To a reggae tune, Adam Sandler describes the decrepit condition of his car.Perhaps the best track is ""The Chanukah Song."" In a clever way, Mr. Sandler creates a Chanukah song that pay tribute to famous Jewish people.Overall, it was an okay CD. There were plenty of amusing tracks, but some were just filler to take up space--namely ""Exicited Southerner"" tracks."
4,Not Enough Songs,"Don't get me wrong...I'm a big Adam Sandler fan. The coolest skits are ""Do it for Mama,"" ""The Goat,"" ""Sex or Weightlifting,"" and ""The Hypnotist."" The best songs were the classics- ""Ode to my Car,"" ""The Chanakuh Song,"" and ""Steve Polychronopolous."" The Excited Southerner series was a bit hard to understand and I don't like the song ""What the hell happened to me,"" but other than that, it was cool. Also, check out ""Memory Lane."""
3,Cut out the excited Southerner cr*p and I'll give it 4.5,I really like Adam Sandler but I agree that the sterotypical southerner is not very funny. People can make fun of us and we can enjoy it if it is well done...this was not. In contrast such pieces as the farting hypnotist was by contrast ROTFL funny.
1,An Apt Title,"I thought I was a fan of Adam Sandler until I bought this CD andlistened to all of it. Adam Sandler is a great comedic actor infilms, as he was on SNL, but he is NOT George Carlin or Bill Cosby!The ONLY good thing on this disc is ""The Chanukah Song"". Track #18,""Mr. Bake-O"" is about a guy getting massively stoned. One wondersif this was recorded first as a ""live"" event, as only someone underthe influence of marijuana could find the rest of this stuff funny!The ""Excited Southerner"" character does not sound like anyone fromthe south I've met. Tracks 3,4,5,7,9,10,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,and 20are disappointingly unfunny, while track 11, ""Do it for your Mama"",is sick, gross, and just plain wrong!Recommendation: go to a legal download site and pay a buck todownload ""The Chanukah Song"" and skip the rest!"
1,Sad,"If Adam Sandler is the ""Funniest Man in America,"" then America's sense of humor (not to mention its dignity) has gone down the sewer.Buy this only if you still think that non-stop four-letter words is brilliant comedy.As for me, I bought it because I thought that ""Ode To My Car"" was sort of amusing when I heard it on the radio (in edited form, of course). I admit I knew little else about Adam Sandler. Now I know way too much. Refuse this refuse."
2,This is not Adam's best work,"I did not think this is his best. It'll make you smile, not laugh like his most recent CD. You'll smile, shocked at the use of all those cuss words (which I did not mind) but the effect will run out quickly. By the 3rd track you'll just get used to it and think you could have used a better word than that repetitive F... to make it funnier. The songs were really not that funny, some of the skits are somehat entertaining but you'll end up smiling and thinking that they are either Grossfunny, Stupid-funny or just Weird-Funny. Mediocre really !"
1,adam sandler [sick],"Do you think jokes about a mom making her sons masticate by the pool is funnY? No, I dont either!! But this is all my friends play!! For humor I prefer Woody Allen!1 Go seee Scoop with Scarlett!!!"
5,very very funny but inapropriate for some young people,"this cd is a hilarious array of songs and dialougoues which are very innapropriate for young adults but can be funny for matuer teens and adults. this cd contains the popular songs like the ""chanukah"" song and the ""goat"" song. I strongly suggest you here this cd before letting your children or yourself get it. I have this cd and i like it a lot. WARNING: BEFORE YOU BUY THIS CD I STRONGLY SUGGEST YOU LOOK AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CD CASE AT THE HUGE SIGN WITH EXPLICIT LYRICS!!!"
4,all about crazy love,"My fiancee and I almost died when we first heard ""Crazy Love"". We think it fits us so well, that we plan to surprise our wedding guests and perform this song as a duet at our reception! Does anyone know how we might be able to get an instrumental version of the song that we could sing along with? Adam has actually inspired future ""Wedding Singers""!"
1,No Good For Me,"Rhodiola didn't do much for me. Then again, no natural remedies have yet. I've tried valerian root and passion flower and have not had much of an effect with them, either. This might work for you, but it didn't work for me."
4,good read,book came on time and is a good read.no markings or bends in the book. great shape and exactly what i wanted
4,"Great content, few difficulties on kindle","Paul Ekman gives a very useful and comprehensive instruction on how to read emotions from facial expressions. I probably would have given five stars for the printed edition. But having downloaded it on my kindle I can't use chapter ten properly, where the reader is invited to cut out the pictures for practise. In my opinion that's a real disadvantage one should know before deciding which edition to buy."
5,Amazing,"This book provides the basic tools for beginning to understand the body language of the face.(Note: do not buy this for a Kindle, because it is graphics intensive and the Kindle has extremely poor image functionality.)Like any book on body language, the skill is acquired through careful observation of people in the real world. But this book tells you where to look and what to look for. Having read it and just started playing with the flash cards, I find myself suddenly more observant of people's eyebrows, the wrinkles in their forehead, and their naso-labial wrinkles. Especially while watching movies, where there are lots of closeups and no taboo against staring closely at someone's face."
3,More of the same,"If you like the topic, this is more of the same. Some repeat and repackaging of the same material"
3,Works OK not as good as I'd like!!!,This is a great little remote if you don't mind sitting fairly close to the ir receiver.Maybe the battery's weren't as fresh as they could be and I haven't had the time to investigate it further.I downloaded the beta driver (2.4) from keyspan so now I can control Frontrow.So if your expectations aren't too high you won't get dissapointed.
3,Good but not Great,"I purchased this item since most of my music is now MP3s on my home PC which is piped into my home audio system.At first with 10 mins of setup it worked flawlessly. It controlled WinAmp to a T after a very short session with the map editor. It also worked fine with Windows Media Player. After a couple of weeks however my maps seem to have gotten removed. No problem, I set them back up again in about 10 minutes.Now its 3 more weeks later and the remote refuses to work properly if at all. I now must open the map editor and re-program the remote for winamp for it to work properly. Frankly Id rather just use the mouse. Ughh."
3,Painful Setup,"When first setting up the program it took me nearly 1-2 hours of tinkering with the map program to figure out that the mapping program can't recognise programs which have spaces in the name (for example: ""Media Jukebox.exe""), so these must be changed to something like ""Media_Jukebox.exe"". It would've been helpful and saved me some time if they had included this information. Once I cleared up that problem, it seems to be working so far, but getting the remote operational took far longer than it should've. It is a good product when working, but if they've overlooked such a major issue, I can only imagine what other software problems they haven't mentioned."
3,Okay product,Had difficulty using this remote with the system at my school. Never had full use of all the buttons. When I started using it regularly in my classrooom the button labels wore off and I had to figure out which was which again. Since then I have found several other similar products on the market that I'd like to replace it with.
2,Works OK,This worked well for the application but the batteries just kept on dieing in the remote. If they had a larger remote with AAA batteries I would have given it a 4.
1,This will NOT work with the Airport Express.,Be advised that this will NOT work with the airport express and you need the newer (and more expensive :( ) version of this product in order to use it with the airport express. It cannot be updated to work with it either. Because of this I had to return it.
4,Exelent product,"The remote works great! I can control all my DVDs with it from across the room. At first I had a little trouble configguring the remote, but now it is configgured and it works great. I would note that there is a newer version of the software for the remote out than what came on my CD. As of today (3/26/06), the latest version of the software is 2.2, and can be found at [...]"
2,Disappointing if you've seen him live,Robert Stewart is the finest sax player to see live in San Francisco if you ask me. His live shows are awesome. Unfortunately this CD is way overproduced and has that horrible Kenny-G soft jazz sound to it that lesser saxaphonists use to cover up the fact that they aren't very good. You really can't even tell it's him on the sax. I'd pay twice the price just for a good DAT recording of some of his shows...Robert you are great. Please put out a minimally produced album that captures those licks you lay down at Bruno's. This soft super produced sound has got to go!
2,A far departure from Season One in every sense,"The Second Season of Hex was a great disappointment to this viewer. I really liked the first series and was looking forward to the next. By the fourth episode, I lost all hope of it getting any better.A demon hunter is introduced in this season and becomes the main focus. In fact, most of the secondary characters now move center stage and not even the evil spawn taking over the school can save the dullness. I had to force myself to keep watching in spots - NEVER a good sign.Season Two is almost a stand alone series with little in common with the great First Season. Not even having Thelma stick around can save it. Maybe this was due to having the extremely loyal Thelma (we are talking friendship to the death kind of loyality) switch alliances.Maybe the first series set up a higher expectation that this series just did not meet. Or maybe, it was just the unbelievably crappy ending."
4,Loved and completely disappointed...,"I have been watching this series on dish and bought the first season because I absolutely fell in love with it. I am completely upset to find out it was canceled. This show had potential. These shows and movies that the States produce are not as steamy and daring as this show was and like one of the reviewers said, it made Buffy the Vampire Slayer look cute at times.I am hoping to get the second season on discs. I have most of them recorded from watching them on TV. But to own them would be so much better. I will miss this show, so I guess I'll have to find something else to entertain me on Sunday nights. Oh well.Hurry US and get season two on DVD."
2,Great Game But Not Durable,I purchased this plug-n-play game at a local Wal-Mart for my 7 year-old. I brought it home and tried playing it but it did not work properly. (Got sound but no video). I returned it back to the store for a second one and it worked fine . . .for about 6 months. Then I noticed that the sound would start going out intermittently -because the cord/wire guage used was so thin w/poor strain relief that wire inside was actually bending/breaking after many times of being plugged in & put away. (My son would unplug & wrap it up (loosely) to put away each time.) I would recommend this game is JAKKS would re-do their cable/wires to be more durable.
4,"Great game, but controller broke after a month","Our family loved playing this game and played daily after Christmas. However, the joy stick broke before it was a month old. Still, for the price it is a great deal. The games are fun and challenging for the young kids and the adults. We are already considering buying a second one."
5,Tito's all time great,This is Tito's all-time favorite song. Although made popular by Santana - this has Tito written all over it! You can't go wrong with any of Tito's albums - but this one is a must buy!
5,Works great,"As mentioned in other posts, make sure you boot into Windows, install the driver from the CD, turn off the computer, insert card and connect your Windows drive and make sure you can boot into Windows. Did all that and its been working for months now without any issues."
1,POS,"My BIOS sees the card fine, but no matter what I did, Windows 7 will not properly install the drivers.I wanted to use this card just as a controller for a CDRW drive and not for RAID. The manufacturer's web site instructs to flash the BIOS on the card to use without RAID. However they fail to provide the instructions on how to do that. After a Google search I found the process and flashed the BIOS on the card.Still will not install the drivers in device manager, even though it now shows as a SATALink instead of RAID controller.Downloaded the latest drivers for Windows 7 from the manuf web site and get an error that the driver isn't for the device.At this point I surrendered and returned the card."
5,Perfect for adding a Blu-Ray drive,My older PC only has two SATA ports and those are filled with hard drives. I wanted to add a Blu-Ray drive and this card allowed me to do so. I just popped the case open and dropped the card in along with my new drive and I was all set!
5,Very Pleased,I got exactly what I wanted for the price I needed. The dress is so cute and is just as it was described. The shipping price was affordable and the product came very quickly. My daughter just loves it.
4,A decent book for the beginner,"I used this book for a networking class I took at a local community college. I actually thought the book was pretty good. The author does a good job of making the topics easy to read and understand. In addition, he uses a lot of ""real world"" examples. While the book doesn't go overly in-depth, it does cover quite a bit of information. I give it 4 stars."
4,A must have,This is one of the must have book for a professional web programmer.Dino write clear how ASP.NET works specifing the deep details.
1,Worst book ever buy,"I have read this author's [..] book ed 2003. It is good, since it contains a lot of useful examples. But his current two books for 2005 are very bad. There is a few of very short useless examples in the books. He just talks about ""theory"" and lists the spec and a few of web snapshots which are useless for any level readers.I have read almost all [..] books in libraries. His two books are worst. I do not think that he wrote those books with care. The core book is not core; the advanced is useless.his two books are totally garbage for me. I never say anything like that in anytime and anywhere else."
4,Written by somebody who knows what he is talking about,Basics of .net framework is presented in a clear and lucid style. This book is a joy to read and . by the way there is not much difference in content wise between applied .Net framework programming and this book. My only worry is the speed at which microsoft is pushing .net versions as if there is no tommorrow! [Subsequently the catch up I have to do on reading all this!]
5,My son... now me.,Case Close is the best anime i've ever seen... next to inuyasha... it's a high quality cartoon... gives me alot more than the typical thriller.
5,case closed is my favorite show on adult swim,"ok, ive been watching this show since i got out of school and i have to say, its my favorite show on tv rite now. i havent missed a single episode since i started watching. sure its anime but i like anime. who cares if giant beads of sweat run down their heads or their eyes get different sizes or they laugh and their tongue sticks out like a foot or their head gets huge and the mouth is enormous (see ""murder at the television studio""). this show is very interesting. it may not be for little kids, but this show is very fun to watch. i like the ending song and the music on the show. its always the least suspected person that turns out to be the killer. i hate it on weekends wen its not on. i cant wait til monday though. if you havent seen an episode yet... TUNE IN TO IT AT 1:00 EASTERN 12:00 CENTRAL ETC. thanks for taking the time to read my review! remember...ONE TRUTH WILL PREVAIL!"
2,Could use some improvements,"Not wide enough for the shoulders of a 6 month old when in recline position. The wheels have a mind of their own. The handles make it hard to go up curbs. Hard to close up, need both hands and foot.But can fit a Graco infant car seat, compact fold, and light."
2,Disappointing,"There were only a few tracks that I liked: ""Avenue"", ""Cardiac Motion"", ""The Swimmer"" and ""Kiss the Sound"", the rest I thought was fairly boring stuff."
1,Cheaply made. Does not work as advertised!,"This product is VERY cheaply made. Does not work as advertised (even after buying new and expensive replacement batteries (and YES, they were the right type of batteries!). Plain and simple, this product does not work as advertised. Avoid."
5,Christmas light tester that works,"After trying several other testers, this is one great little product that really works and I can troubleshoot lights much easier, now."
4,Looks good & feels good,"I bought these boots 5 months ago to wear for work and play. I am on my feet for 8+ hours a day on hard surfaces. At first they were very uncomfortable and I thought I had made a mistake buying them. After about a week or so they were ""broke in"". Now they are incredibly comfortable and my feet feel great even after a long day at work. They are very sharp looking and seem to be of high quality. I am very pleased with Wolverine and I plan on purchasing more of their product in the future."
4,Expensive but excellent,"Greetings! These Woverines are diesel. Though a bit pricey, they are well-made and fairly comfortable. Even though I bought the Extra-Wide size, they still feel a bit too narrow for my sasquatch feet; if you have wide feet, think two sizes up in terms of width."
5,Comfortable right out of the box,"These boots fit great, look great, and are extremely comfortable right out of the box! Hopefully, they will be durable!"
5,Great hiking boot for a great price,"I bought these to replace my Timberland boots that recently fell apart. So far, these seem comfortable, rugged, and durable with great traction."
3,Fit could be better,"The shoes are okay; but not a really great fit. Unfortunately, the seller will not take back worn shoes like Online Shoes or Zappos.com."
5,Another Great Record From The Yanks,"DON'T TREAD is another great record, including such songs as the stay-out-of-my-backyard anthem title track and the reflective ballads ""Where You Goin' Now"" and ""Silence Is Broken."" This time, there are a few less-than-stellar cuts, but overall, this is another great record that makes you wonder why they didn't do another album."
5,Review from the Publisher,"848 pages, Paperbound, Imprimatur. Alphabetical, topic-by-topic selection of passages from the Douay-Rheims Bible, originally compiled to help priests prepare sermons. Over 1,900 topics and 18,000 Bible verses! Unlike other concordances, this one quotes the actual passages in full. A quick way to learn just what the Bible says on a host of topics. A great aid, belongs in every home!"
5,Fine topical concordance for Catholic Scripture Study.,"If one needs a good, usable topical Catholic Concordance this is the one. The edition I have is the older hardback, but the content of the new edition published by Tan Books is the same.The new edition is a paperback with a glued binding, and will not last with heavy use. However, having this concordance to the Douay-Rheims Bible is worth the poor binding.The Concordance is suprisingly deep and comprehensive, covering both Biblical and Theological subjects making it a fine tool for personal or group Bible Study."
4,a quite useful book,"When studying scripture or just reading the Bible you occasionally run into subject you would like to read more extensively about - a subject concordance is very useful for this type research. It is a must that the concordance, wether a word or subject concordance, be keyed to the version of the Bible you use. Unfortunately, in my case, this concordance is not keyed to the version of the Bible I normally use. However, I have a version of the Bible it is keyed too. To be clear, this mistake is not Amazons fault, the version of the Bible this concordance is keyed to is on the additional information screen."
3,Oudated but somewhat helpful,"After submitting my new novel to many of the book publishers listed in PUTTInG Out, I began getting return to sender envelopes daily. It seems the lesbian/gay market is so unstable, that many of the listed presses have already gone out of business, are no longer accepting manuscripts, etc. So be advised: check first before sending anything. The book is helpful for the presses that were still in business. Looking forward to a new updated edition."
2,"Lots of hype, somewhat helpful","You may find this book to be helpful if you don't have high expectations. I imagine that the listings of publishers will be useful to you if they are still current; however, I note that several of the women's publishers' listings are not current as of December 2000. The articles in the front of the book were only moderately interesting for my genre (erotica), but again, I think my expectations were too high. Certainly helpful for the price, and content will be more helpful for those wishing to publish short pieces in magazines and journals."
5,Awesome Early BNL,"This is what they sounded liek in the begining. Some good music and fun but not quite the sound we get from them on RockSpecticle. I am an avid fan and just love to listen to this album since a lot fo these they still play in concert. Learn more about bnl at their website, BNL.org"
5,Simply the best,"All I have to say (as a devote BNL fan) is that this album is one of the best, if not the best album around. I recommend it to everyone. This has it all, ballads, funny songs, rock songs, etc..It truly is the best CD for the money"
4,"Good, but still not their best!","This album contains a few of BNL's best songs. The lyrics are the best part of this cd, they're humorous and witty. My favorite song is also on this album, ""This is Where it Ends."" Another great one is Jim Creegan's song-writing debut (for BNL on an album, anyway) ""There's a Spider in My Room"" which is filled with all the quirkiness that BNL fans adore. Also on this album are three originals from the more-popular live album, ""Old Apartment,"" ""Break Your Heart,"" and ""When I Fall."" It's worthwhile to listen to the originals, but on the live cd the songs have much more intensity.Some songs previously not mentioned that are worth mentioning are ""Show Box,"" and ""In the Drink,"" which are both fun light songs.All in all, a great cd for old fans and new ones. A very close second to their best album, Gordon."
2,Terrible example of modern music.,This CD is quite possibly the worst CD in my collection. The songs are all annoyingly the same and I found most of the lyrics offending. This CD is absurd.
5,Fantastic!,"The Barenaked Ladies show their full spectrum of talent on this album. The silly stuff they're mostly known for, the balads that touch your heart, and the absolutely outstanding harmonies that get you addicted!"
4,"A good CD, but not the Ladies' best","I consider myself a Barenaked Ladies fan. I have all their albums, and have seen a number of shows. However, I consider this to be my least favorite album of theirs. It has some great stuff on it, but it also has two songs on it that I don't like. On all of the other albums, I can listen to the whole thing without having to press the skip button. That's why this one gets four stars instead of five. But still, I would rather listen to BOAPS than a CD from another artist. Plus, there's some fun multimedia. All in all a great CD, even if it's not their best, and that in itself says a lot about the quality of material that Barenaked Ladies puts out there."
4,good shoes,"I never buy shoes online until these. They are very comfortable, were delivered on time, and in good shape. The only reason I gave them four instead of five stars is because they run just a tad small. Being mules, however, it was no real big deal as they are without a back. I would definitely recommend Clark's however."
2,Disappointing for Clark's,"Attractive shoe, but very uncomfortable. The arch is unnaturally high. I can't even wear these."
2,Narrow!,"Great price but lacks in comfort. These shoes are very narrow and I also find them a bit wobbly. Unfortunately, they are not worth returning to amazon for what I paid."
4,Good!!,"A great way to start your day, it's better than my morning coffee. My morning coffee. A must have. g"
5,knowledgable,Just what we all need for a blessed day. Inspirational and conforting. I highly recommand it to all who feels the need to start the day with beautiful and inspirational devotions!
5,Praying the Names of God,Awesome book to study the names and meaning of God. Use it for self and group Bible study. Gives Hebrew and Greek spellings/definitions - not too in-depth but enough to help someone understand. Third time to get this book (keep giving them away). Received this last book a lot quicker than anticipated. Thanks!
3,insightful and provocative,"This is a good daily devotional that offers deep and insightful observations about God's character. The daily questions and devotional prompts are challenging. At times, it would be helpful to see some follow up to the deeper questions. My biggest complaint is one of formatting. Text size is inconsistent, which is difficult for these aging eyes."
4,Informative and transforming,"Most believers won't study Hebrew or intense theology of the Old Testament. While this book cannot replace that type of formal education, it is a glimpse into the original language of our scriptures. So, it's valuable for us to read, and a gift to understand.In a beautifully written devotional, Ann Spangler defines the different names used to reference God throughout scripture. Understanding these names & descriptions cannot help but enrich our personal study of scripture, our prayers, and application in our daily lives. While primarily intended as a guide for daily prayer, this book is also a nice reference - and supplement - to scripture studies. In understanding each name, we receive a better (perhaps new) view of our God.I appreciated the chance to learn titles that have been used to address and refer to God throughout history. I think you will find, like I have, that a new perspective of the One we worship can transform our own prayer, understanding, and outlook."
4,Review pages 289-304 before you purchase,"I absolutely love this book, however, when I got to page 289, I found that 2 chapters of The Purpose Driven Life had been inserted into the book - omitting the same number of pages from Praying the Names. It cuts off on Thursday, and doesn't pick up until 1 chapter later - on Monday. 15 pages total are missing.When you receive your copy, check those pages first and return it for a correct version."
5,The Kids Love It!,"My 3 children, ages 4,8 & 15) love this book!. Its great fun for the little ones and has wonderful science experiments for the older kids. The best Kid Concoctions book yet!"
5,Best of the series!!,"My kids & I were so excited to purchase this 4th book in the Kid Concoctions series! We didn't even know ther was a 4th book until we read in the newspaper it had just won the Parents' Choice award. My children have growen up on the first 3 books and love this new book full of fresh innovative ideas. There is everything from Hollywood special effects to Sea Monkeys, flying rockets, and even a jet boat all made in minutes from household items. This book get our family vote for the best of all the Kid Concoctions books!!"
3,Some Don't Work,"I own several of the kid concoctions books; a few of the contraptions/concoctions we've tried didn't work. My daughter, who teaches school also tried them, she said some worked okay, but others didn't work at all. She also said they look good on paper, they seems like they'll work, but don't. One example the balloon hovercraft didn't work, we even tried several different sizes of balloons."
1,Disappointing as some experiments don't work,"This was very disappointing as some experiments, such as the balloon hovercraft look so cool in the book, but don't work at all. I wondered if the people who wrote the book even tried out the experiments - sure doesn't seem like it, as I followed the directions to the letter. (9"" balloons etc.) I'm a kindergarten teacher and the kids were disappointed when it didn't work. I'd advise against these books as they are too unreliable and disappointing to children and adults. I've had great luck with other books. Steve Spangler has a website loaded with AWESOME science experiments and he pretests all of them - you can even see videos of his experiments on his website."
5,Excellent Product,For its size you will find this speaker to be more than adequate to support both the vocal artist and the personal speaker.
3,A great book for people who are synics of our Government.,Mr. Peters goes through many of his experiences in civil service and how Washingtonians perpetuate a system that does not work for the common man. This book brings insight for those who have not ever been or worked in our Nations capitol.
1,Bad Design,"This tool does not work at all. The one end with the single opening is way too thick-- it should be thinner metal so you can see what your are doing. The other end looks like a slotted spoon and I don't know why! When I press either end on a clogged pore, it is not effective; it just seems to push everything in deeper."
3,Stylish but not Heavy Duty,"This is a stylish, lightweight brace, but I broke it in about a week. Should be fine for using a computer and other light tasks but if you need to pick up something heavy, get another brace."
3,"Quite useful, yet...","I find this sheetbook quite useful. Needless to say, if you don't have the album don't bother with it. However it contains some fine music and it is excellent excercise too. Still I find a repeating problem with all of Sting's sheetbooks. They all seem like adapted versions of the songs, not how they're really played. So if you find the bass riff in the beggining of ""Fields of gold"" unlike the original, it is because it is originally played by the horn, and so on... Still, It's worth it."
1,Not useful at all,"This item is nothing more than a tiny case study written by the software company that reads more than an advertisement for the software company rather than a moderately detailed and useful case study. You can get this from the software company for free. I wasted $5 don't waste your money. Better yet, contact the company in the case study yourself."
1,Pretty Watch,I've been wearing my Philip Stein watch for more than a month. It's a pretty watch but beyond that I feel no differently than I did with my Rolex.
2,Poorly made :(,"Lhasa is great, order arrived well packaged, and with their full catalog. But the products I ordered were not up to par. Cheaply made acupuncture models that are poorly labeled, and in some cases completely wrong. Nice for patient waiting rooms but definitely not a reliable reference source. Do not get these if you are a TCM student !!!!!!!"
1,Words and attitudes are UGLY!,"If you want to teach your preschooler words like ""brat,"" ""hate,"" ""stupid,"" and sentiments like ""that's mine!"" and ""so what?""... this is the book for you. (Forget the fact that it makes very little sense -- a vat? a talking hat? I can understand some funny nonsense for the sake of easy-to-read rhyming words, but this is just loony.) I'm stunned. Wish I'd read the reviews first. This is going directly into the recycling bin."
5,Makes me laugh every time,"Such a cute story, and it has my daughter, husband, and I all giggling.The way the words repeat is great too, I can see how she is recognizing a lot of the words, mat, cat, hat, rat, etc."
1,Very Disappointing,"My son, who has just turned 4, has just started to learn to read. After completing his first book at school, we went and purhcased this book as it had many of the simple short words that he is learning. Given the level of the book, it never occured to me to review it first and imagine my surprise when I read ""The rat hates the cat"" and ""You think I am stupid"" and ""My dear little brat"". My 4 year old is aware of words like ""hate"" and ""stupid"" but he also knows that those are not kind words and they don't have a place in our house. I am returning the book and now question Harper Collin's ability to review books and give their opinion.I agree with a previous reviewer in that the book is very rude and does not teach good behavior. I want my son to learn to read, but not at the expense of his manners!I strongly encourage those considering this book to re-consider. There's enough rudeness and harsh words in this world without having to introduce them in a small child's book.[...]"
1,Not appropriate for young children,"I bought this book thinking we'd get a good, easy reader for our 3 year old twins. I was surprised and disappointed to see that the book is full of negative attitudes and really inappropriate language and material for young kids. There's no joy and no happy characters in this book. Everyone has a bad attitude and says things like ""So what"" when asked to get off the titular mat. I was really unhappy with the way this story unfolded. The use of terms like ""hate"" and ""stupid"" was the last straw and this book is off our reading list.I know that my kids will eventually be unable to escape conflict and hate and people calling each other stupid, but there's no reason that they need this from their learning-to-read books at such a young age. Give this book a pass."
5,The first book my daughter tried to read,"The book rhymes nicely yet is entertaining and humorous. My daughter tries (and succeeds) to recite the words as she flicks through the book and sees the pictures, yet she is only 2 1/2 years old. This is the first book she has read."
1,Bad language for childs book,Most children reading this book are staring in kinder if not younger. This book has several words (hate and stupid) that at this age we are teaching are children not to say. Why right those words in a children's book? You can rhyme with many words on their level and encourage reading without these. Think about the children you are writing it for them.
1,constant theme of tension and 'not getting along',"I bought this book at Target for my 2 year old son who is quickly learning his ABC's and loves reading. I thought the idea of a book with tons of rhyming words would be good, and with a title like, 'The Fat Cat Sat on the Mat', why should I pre-read it? It's for pre-schoolers, right? I was VERY disappointed to see that Nurit Karlin was thoughtless enough to think that using the words 'hate' and 'stupid' and 'brat' was a good idea in a book aimed at TINY CHILDREN. The theme throughout the book is that of not getting along, extreme possession, ganging up on others, and treating each other badly. Oh god, you should have seen my face when the rat went to get his BAT to get the cat off the mat.. I was at least relieved to see it was an actual bat, not a possible violent weapon. This book is now in the trash."
1,Ugly language used for a toddler's/children's book,"My wife and I bought a bunch of books in the I Can Read series. One of the books was ""The Fat Cat Sat on the Mat"". I started reading it to my 22 month old son tonight before bed and stopped as I quickly realized the extremely ugly language. How did this book get past the editor/publisher HarperCollins and also the author didn't realize the audience? This book should be pulled from the shelf. See below for some examples:""The rat hates the cat. The cat does not care. The cat, who is fat, .... The rat hates that.""The witch has a pet rat called ""the little brat""""Then I will go and get my bat, said the rat. It will get you off the mat. No it won't, said the cat.""""You think I am stupid, said the cat...""Again, it's a shame that we wasted an evening reading this hateful, negative book. This will be returned to the store with a complaint to the bookseller and also I'll write the publisher.Please vote with your dollar and do not support this.Thanks,Brian"
1,Inappropriate,"This book uses words like ""hate"" and ""stupid"". These words are wholly unacceptable in a book meant for children aged pre-K to first grade."
1,Not for 4-6 year olds!,"I was very excited to see a book with ""-at"" words, because my daughter was learning to sound them out. But this book is not appropriate for the preschool age it is geared toward! It has words like brat and stupid, which I do NOT want my daughter saying. If there was free return shipping, I'd return it. If you are raising nice, polite children, stay away from this book."
1,Really not ok for little kids,"I'm in total agreement with the others who have posted negative reviews of this book. I was shocked to read it and have since gotten rid of this book. All the characters have really negative attitudes, call each other ""stupid"", and ""hate"" each other. The cat has a profoundly negative attitude and responds with ""so what"" every time anyone asks him to get off the mat. When the mouse said he was going to get his bat to get the cat off the mat, I was sure it was going to be a baseball bat and the cat was going to be bludgeoned to death. It turns out to only be an animal-type bat, but the fact that I was legitimately afraid that the mouse was going to use a baseball bat on the cat should tell you something about this book. Totally inappropriate for young children and sets a terrible example for all children."

3,Intimate,This book was ok to pass a dismal day. I was fine with the man but the female could have been a bit brighter.
5,Fun gift idea,I love making chocolates in all different shapes for people for various occasions. This was another opportunity to do that for someone fighting a squirrel problem in their yard. Have fun with this item!
5,First is best,"This is the first book in the 5-volume Calhoun series, and it is the best of the lot by a rather wide margin. It should also be read first, but I read it after the other four books.The writing here is more focused, tighter. There is no lurid bedroom distraction--the first Nora Roberts book I've read without one. Somehow it works better that way. The plot works nicely. C.C. Calhoun is a shapely if rather oily auto mechanic heroine, and Trent St. James is a thirtyish businessman, bent upon buying the sisters' castle and turning it into a luxurious hotel. The conflict of personalities and life aims is certainly there and keeps the book moving.But once again, what makes most Nora Roberts books worth reading is her ability to create a place and take the reader there. This time it is a century old stone castle overlooking the ocean in Bar Harbor, Maine.The characters and dialogue are OK, like the plot. It is Bar Harbor and the castle that kept me reading and interested me."
3,Well done!,"They couldn't be more different: she was an automobile mechanic with no tolerance for Italian loafers; he was a driven businessman with a liking for sophisticated women who didn't expect marriage. It was hate at first sight, but the sparks were flying. C.C.'s aunt just knew they were perfect for each other. Roberts begins a quartet of romances about the Calhoun sisters, tying the books together with an ill-fated romance from the past and a missing necklace to find. C.C. was the type of heroine I most enjoy: a woman who works with her hands, feisty and sure of her own self-worth."
5,Enlightenment,"This is a wonderful movie. It gives insight on what Buddism is all about. For folks who are not sure what they want, this is a good movie to watch."
2,Buddhism,A waste of money. I should of just rented the DVDs from netflix before buying it. It is really boring
4,Tony Little's DVD,"This DVD shows how to use Tony Little's Gazelle exercise machine. He's very enthusiastic and encouraging. Whoever made this video should have shown the motion in slow motion and close up so that the beginner can see exactly where to place his foot, when the foot stays flat and when to lift the heel, etc."
2,Handle broke early on,Rigged up my own brush so that it fit in the stailess container after the original one broke. Don't really like the construction of the brush itself...seemed flimsy. Container is nice though...
3,Nice lightweight piece. Quality of stones acceptable.,"The gold band is a little thin, but the pearls and diamonds are of good quality. The diamond accents, surprisingly, were ""eye-clear"" and very bright. Overall pleased, just wish the band was a little wider. This product is okay if you are needing a secondary accent piece, but a little lightweight for everyday wear. Would recommend."
5,Jerkstore Rules,"What a Release !!!! I couldent say anything , when i first listened to that music - Thats one hell of a Record - Buy IT if you want some really heavy and melodic music !Good job guys - I look forward to the next album (Oh Yeahhhh)Jerkstore Rules!"
5,"Amusing, Surprising and Emotionally True","Merin Wexler has written a short story collection which you can get happily lost in. Each story drew me in. Each story amused and surprised me, made me hold it tight, not wanting it to end. Each story has lingered in my mind. These stories have some delightful quirks and odd bits, but nothing in them feels false or forced; all of them feel emotionally true. An outstanding short story collection."
5,great gift for girls...and boys,"This little book hits the spot for preteen & older readers. It's graphically colorful, with a variety of interesting photos & illustrations; it's written conversationally, yet with enough factual citations to validate the unbelievable, heroic stories; and, it introduces the reader to a cast of amazing female characters mainly unheard of in contemporary American culture.I bought it to send to my grandchildren, but was captivated into reading it myself. I learned a lot."
3,The world's have collided,"I have been a long time Vanilla Fudge fan. On this DVD, this reincarnation of ""The Fudge"" is incredibly tight even after all these years. All the classics are here. The disappointing aspect of the show are the orchestral arrangements. They are way to busy and hokey for my liking and definitely detract from the overall performance. A good example of orchestral arrangements that work is the Styx and the Contemporary Youth Orchestra of Cleveland concert. Here everything meshed fantastically. Still if you like The Vanilla Fudge this DVD is an interesting experience. The tunes do bring back some good memories of some good times."
3,not what one would call definitive,This is not what one would call definitive or scholarly but it is a good start and it saves one from having to plow through Draper!
3,American history book for young people,This is basically a book about American history and hunting. It would be a fair read for youngsters ages 10 to 12. Firearms are basically covered.
4,"Flawed, disorganized, intoxicating and utterly beautiful","For the attentive listener Good God's Urge is as intoxicating as a fine wine on a hot summer's night. Confusing layers in the mixing, however, along with Farrell's distorted voice and cryptic lyrics will not please mainstream listeners. Furthermore the band's faux-hippie ideals seem dated and frankly lame, but Farrell's earnestness and fantastic delivery brings listeners to see the world through his hungry eyes . . . and it is indeed a very beautful, magical world."
1,"boring, buy the first album and be done","Buy the first album, it's much livlier. This album is like slow Janes Addiction, except really DULL. The first Porno album is awesome, but pass on this one. I played it several times today expecting an even better experience over the first album and was hugely let down. Oh well, it was cheap."
4,almost classic,"this is one of those albums you keep going back to every few months or years...intriguing and interesting and some of the songs are very, very addictive. a lot of depth both musically and lyrically, and overall pretty satisifying...IF you don't listen to it too much.definitely a one-of-a-kind artifact of the 90s...the talent of Perry without the abrasiveness and/or over-the-top weirdness of much of his other stuff.i'm trying to say why it's not a 5-star but i can't quite...something about his voice and just the quaintness of it keeps it from the top tier, but i like it better than any single Jane's Addiction album, let's just say. but Jane's Addiction is still better...see what i mean? lolall in all, if you don't mind the ""soft and fuzzy"" and ""kinda artistic"" qualities then you should get it. but it's not for everyone.i'd say an 90s alt-rock classic at 4.5 stars."
2,I couldn't give this CD away fast enough,"This CD is rubbish...No matter how I tried to ""understand"" or get into this album I never got it...It's like one, boring 45-minute song...What's sad, too, is the new Jane's Addiction CD ""Strays"" is striking me the same way...Maybe I've just out-grown these guys..."
3,3 stars,It is nice that it has several different ways to play. But the kids got bored with it quickly because although the objective to each game changes you are doing the same thing over and over and over again....that is rolling the dice as quickly as you can to get a certain pattern or number.
4,Great Sell,Item arrived on time product was as expected they are great. I would recommend this product to friends. Will buy again.
3,Fun to read,"although i agree with the criticisms of the other reviewer, i found this dictionary easy to use and quite entertaining! for example - the author, in translating the word ""dish"" from english to lao, offers as one definition as ""beautiful girl."" that is just hilarious!"
3,This book is the standard,"Russell Marcus's edition is the classic Lao-English dictionary and essential for any Lao language learning. It is bidirectional which is crtical to improve your new language skills. However, its compactness I believe is owing to the lack of efforts and resources to update it with words of the our modern times. For example, it lacks the jargon specifics of current the business language. It is no different then the 1970s version of this book. However,this is all that is available as far as I can find online. Some one needs to produce or sell a detailed and updated dictionary with 40000 plus words to keep the Lao language up to date."
2,Color,"I purchased the floral shoes - very excited to find pink flowers on a vanilla background.Sadly, the shoes look dirty. The pink did not stand out and the ""vanilla"" was actually more of an ecru color.Very cute idea, but color is way off."
4,Mesmerizing Light and Water Display,"This little fountain puts on quite a light display. As the water drips down over the glass tiers it is illuminated by yellow, blue, and red LEDs. These lights gradually brighten and dim creating an ever-changing, shimmering flow of color through the dripping water. The water almost looks like it is dripping fire. The effect is beautiful and mesmerizing, especially at night. The fountain adds a nice ambience to any room, though it does spatter slightly and is a little bit noisier than I would prefer. Its compact size allows it to fit in many locations and it makes a pleasant addition to my living space. For the price, you get a lot of moving water and light that can only help to improve the flow of energy inside your home or office.(Dr. Simeon Hein is the author of Opening Minds: A Journey of Extraordinary Encounters, Crop Circles, and Resonance (Mount Baldy Press Inc., 2002).)"
4,"Aesthetically Pleasing, Aurally Inadequate","While beautiful to look at, and certainly relaxing, this fountain is really lacking in water noise. The pump is a little too loud, and the sound of the water is pretty much non-existant. However, I love the lighting effect, and I find the visuals of the fountain to be stunning. If you buy it for relaxing, meditation, or more of an artistic piece than to make noise as a waterfall fountain, you will be pleased."
4,Spitting Beauty,"I agree with some of the other reviews, and I admit that I purchased the fountain having read those reviews. I do get a lot of complements on the colors of the fountain, but it does spit water outside the fountain. I have to place the fountain on a towel or plastic mat so the water that splashes over does not ruin my desk. Would I still purchase it, yes because I like the fountain, but I have to say the water splashing is a big problem. They ought to design the fountain so it could be used with the water fountain off. You must make sure you turn it off because the water wasted would cause the pump to run dry if you are not watching the water level."
4,Works Great,"It was a little smaller than I pictured, and it's actually quieter than I anticipated and doesn't splash as much as some folks said. I added some rocks to the base to give it a different look. It works well and the lights are cool, esp. at night."
2,Rajaneesh Kosuri,This fountain $uck$. Lots of motor noise & water droplets spill out of the tray. Avoid buying this model. Got it from Walmart and 'am going to return it promptly.
1,Makes a racket.,"The pump in this fountain makes a racket that far offsetsany relaxing benefits of the flowing water, even in the lowestspeed setting."
4,"SIT BACK, RELAX AND ENJOY","This really hits the spot! The best sounds from JazzFM which is already my favourite Jazz radio station in one compilation. Classic favourites such as Grover's smooth tune 'Just the 2 of us'and Quincy's 'Razzamatazz' put you in the mood to take on some of the new hot smooth Jazz sounds on this album. The deep melodious music from Luther on ""I'm only human"" and Maysa Leeks ""Gotta be Strong"" enhance that relaxed moment.This is definitley the one for warm summer nights lights low, glass of wine to hand and a circle of friends or that special someone reminiscing. Or selfishly indulge yourself by soaking in a hot tub with candles lit all around, sipping from a mug of herbal tea with this albums' powerful sounds enveloping your senses....mmmm bliss."
4,Very Nice,"Nice starter Show. Hope more is released in the future.This is more like Fox Kids type of show, but adults can watch it and still enjoy it."
4,BEACH FUN,This is a fun game that certainly would be a hit at the beach. We played it at my son-in-law's and knew we had to have it when we went on vacation.
4,Kong extreme,I have an 80 lb. very distructive rottweiler and kongs last longer for her then other toys. The last one she had was a large one that lasted about 4 1/2 months before she started getting large peices off of it. I have had this on for about a month and its still holding up for the most part. I only gave it a 4 becouse at the top of it there is (or in my case was) a small ring of rubber at the hole that my dog removed in about 10- 15 minutes. I would advise that anyone with a dog that is prone to eating thing like that keeps an eye on them till its of or remove it before the dog gets it off. That is the only week point on the toy and I would still reccomend it for anyone with a large distructive dog.
5,Good toy for our monster,"We really had no idea what we were getting into, and even after a few weeks, other ""indestructible"" toys had started to fall apart. This thing is a good toy to leave our dog along with in her crate, bounces around in such a way that it's fun for her to chase after, and seems pretty durable."
5,Serious Toy for Serious Chewers,"I have a 95 lb labrador that is sweet in every way. However, he loves to REALLY chew his toys, and it was getting expensive buying him new ones to replace the ones he's performed ""surgery"" on. Most rubber toys, he is able to destroy within 5 minutes. Ropes last him several hours. I needed to get him a seriously indestructible toy for his powerful chewing skills. The Kong Extreme fit the bill completely.I've had mine for over a week, now, he carries it around constantly, chews it constantly, and it doesn't even have DENTS! I'm thrilled.He loves it. Sometimes I put peanut butter or a milkbone in there, but he will play with it no matter what. Sometimes after really giving it a good chew, he puts it down and looks at it to assess the damage, as he used to do with his old toys. It's pretty funny to see his confusion.BUY THIS IF YOU HAVE A POWER CHEWER IN YOUR HOUSE!!!"
5,Stuffed Kongs Rule,"I have the smaller red Kong like this and am glad I bought the extra large Kong. I always put dried vegetables & low sodium chicken broth in mine, then put it in the freezer. It's so much easier to fit bigger chunks of food in the extra large one and the hole at the end is also much much easier to put the marshmallow in to plug the hole. My 10 month old German Shepherd could consume a smaller frozen Kong in less than an hour, but this extra large one takes about an hour or so which is good when I have to leave her alone for a while."
4,Pretty good!,"Just got these the other day for our two new labs (90 and 110 lbs each). They didn't have any toys so we had tried to make due with some stuffed animals but they were getting torn apart so I went ahead and got two Kong's (these ones)because I know they are pretty durable. So far there hasn't been any sort of damage whatsoever but they don't often chew them (at least when we're home) so I don't know exactly how much they chew through it. Before we leave for work we stick some regular Costco dog treats in the Kong to keep them busy and by the time we get home, the treats are gone. We are considering frozen peanut butter too.One thing to know is that these Kong's are indeed Extra Large. Our dogs can barely get their mouths around the whole thing, which is good to an extent, but much bigger and it wouldn't work. Overall a great product! No regrets."
5,2 Years and Still Going Strong,I purchased this toy almost 2 years ago and though it has some scratches there are no missing chunks. The same dog that reduced a red Kong toy to tiny bits has power chewed on this toy and damaged it very little. Putting treats and peanut butter inside keeps her occupied quite a while.
5,For POWER Chewers,"Saying that our dogs like to chew is an understatement. They can destroy just about any dog toy out there within minutes. NOT this Kong toy!This is the ONLY toy (other Kong products as well) we have ever had that has lasted for MONTHS.We have never put any of the snack products available into the middle of any of the Kong toys. I would think if they were chewing to get to the snack, they would destroy the Kong that much faster. ??The red Kong toys are great as well for chewers, but this black Kong toy is perfect for POWER CHEWERS!Our dogs are large neutered rescued females. :) Lab, Collie, Pit bull mixes."
1,Kong Dog Toy,"I have, for years, bought the XL Kong dog toy. They always arrive perfectly 5.5"" toys. These came at 4.5"". Went to PetCO and Pet Smart and their XL are 5.5. Customer service was not willing to acknowledge their error. Will never order from them again. Went on line elsewhere and got them. 5.5"" and this time, red ones, which are neat."
5,"""Paws down"", the longest-lasting toy for my APBT!","She always loved the ""original"" Kong, but unfortunately would usually destroy it in just a day or two. She still hasn't met anything ""indestructible"", but this is the first and only chew-toy that she can lovingly munch at day after day, which lasts for months at a time. It's about time! :)"
3,Okay,We have a 3 year old pit bull and she has already started to tear pieces off of this. The last one we had lasted a year before she was able to tear off any pieces.
5,favorite toy,"My German Shepard is quite ""enthusiastic"" when it comes to his toys and dog bones, etc., and this toy when filled with his favorite treats, it provides him with hours of entertainment and has proven to be virtually indestructable."
5,Great Dane puppy + Kong = Peace,"Great product & quality. My dog is highly motivated by food, this allows her to expend energy in a rewarding way, while giving the adults some peace from her constant need for attention. Oh, thank you Kong!"
3,Not sure,Not sure if I would buy this again. I received it opened it and gave it to my Dane.. He carried it around for a while and dropped it.. I stuffed it with all kinds of his favorite foods and snacks.. He has played with it or chewed on it around 6 times in a month.. He just doesn't care for it.. Prefers his other toys..
1,4 hours = DEAD,It took our 10 month old mutt puppy FOUR hours to rip through this thing. She was already snapping off pieces of the rubber and trying to swallow them. There are so many positive reviews - either we got a lemon or else our puppy is truly a monster.
4,Sturdy!!!,"Since my weimaraner can chomp through anything, this has stood the deal thus far. My only complaint that I have about this product has nothing to do with the product. It has to do with me... I hate knowing if he don't lick all the peanut butter out.. It just sits inside of it... I wash it constantly...Otherwise, great deal and wonderful for what I needed it for.... Will buy more Kong EXTREME products in the future!"
5,Great dog toy,If your dogs are labradors and are chewers get this toy they won't rip this one up. I bought the red kongs and they are all chewed up into little pieces these black are still surviving.
3,FunFor The Dog,Dog loves this toy.You can stuff treats in the middle and watch your dog relentlessly work on getting the treats out.Seems pretty durable.Haven't had it long though.One tiny little piece has been bitten off by the top hole by my pit bull.Very small though.
5,It's so much bigger than the large!,"I was surprised at the size of this product and had to buy different treats to fill it (I previously purchased the large). My Shepherd mix just loves her kongs, especially her XL one. It put an end to her chewing my furniture since she has a challenging toy to keep her busy while I'm at work."
3,Great illustrations!! And great introduction to Norse Myth.,"I bought this book only for the beautiful illustrations. Cotterell introduces the Norse deities in a strict to the point manner(which dissapointed me). I wouldn't recommend this book to any student of mythology for research. However, it would be great for beginners. Anyone of the Asatru faith (like myself)looking for great colorful illustrations of their gods and goddesses, I strongly advise you to buy this book. Cotterell also introduces many Slavic dieties such as: Baba Yaga, Veles, Svarazic, and Perun."
5,MORE THAN JUST A LITTLE MUSIC,"Having been in charge of selecting and ordering children's music at my city's libraries, I realize how hard it is to find good quality music for our collections. Hans is #1 in our area, and I always reccomend his recordings to families, especially for car trips. Kids and parents alike come back asking for more Hans Mayer! Songs like ""Look At Me, I'm An Airplane,"" ""Awfullish Day,"" and ""Just A Little Hug"" teach self-esteem and self-acceptance through lyrics written with love and humor. Add this one to your home (and car) collections!"
4,Sweet taste....,"This album is worth owning just for ""Egg Cream"" and ""Adventurer""--the former brought back fond memories of that NYC treat from childhood visits and then again in the late sixties. If listening to it doesn't make you smile, then you've never tasted an egg cream! The album is kind of a mixed bag, but what really comes through is that this is a real person talking about real life and real emotions. I've been a Lou Reed fan since the beginning, and think that his most recent work (this and the Ecstasy album) is among the best he's ever done. He does his work to please himself, and if you're lucky, you'll like at least some of it too."
3,I would like to listen to this.,"There is definitely a key song, with a key line for me on this album, which is usually why I would like to listen to it, but my neighbors would know that I am listening to Lou Reed, so most of the time I don't. Some things, like subscribing to a newspaper, have gone to such great lengths to explore the absence of decency in everything that they see and do, that the best approach to getting on with it all is by stretching reality to the Lou Reed limit, best expressed in the song ""Sex with your parents"" by the line: Senator, it has been reported that you have had illegal Congress with your mother. There is a word for this, and Lou Reed knows that word, too, and the song was recorded live on July 4, 1995, and people might have been paying attention. I would listen to this, but my neighbors would know that I was listening to Lou Reed. There are limits to how much ambivalence people are willing to tolerate, and I don't need to know their opinion about this one."
3,Noise,"What happened to Lou Reed? If he is happy , good for him. But this album is silly lyrics with noisy guitars. What happened to the craft of New Sensations, New York, Magic and Loss or even Songs for Drella? I hope this isnt the start of his downfall.........."
1,Couldn't even stand to have it around,"I am a long standing Lou Reed fan, from the Velvets up through Magic and Loss. This CD, however, I had to throw away. It was just so completely bad I couldn't stand to have it around my other Lou Reed titles."
2,"set the twilight reeling = lame, lousy lou","despite the two killer tunes that open this record (egg cream and nyc man), set the twilight reeling is a boring failure. mushy drivel like trade-in renders most of this album unlistenable. hey lou: enough with the moon in june new love of your life nonsense--NO ONE CARES."
1,Just awful...awful...,"I'm glad Lou has finally fallen in love and found a soul mate in Laurie Anderson. Really, I am. However, his new relationship has affected his music for the worse. This CD is awful. Awful, awful, awful. From beginning to end, one bad song after another. And you'd be hard pressed to find worse Lou Reed lyrics than ""Egg Cream."" Ugh. He's on autopilot here (much like some of his questionable 70's efforts - ""Sally Can't Dance"" anyone?). This CD is so bad it hurts. It hurts because Lou is more capable than producing fluff like this. One day (probably after he breaks up with Laurie Anderson) Lou is going to cringe hard when he listens to this CD. Time is running out for Lou. I hope his next CD finds him back to form."
2,Worst Lou Reed Album since the 1970s,"""Set the Twilight Reeling"" is, unfortunately, the worst album that Lou Reed has made since his ""comeback"" album ""New York"" in 1989. At the time it was recorded, he was in love and reasonably content with life. Unfortunately, when happy Lou just isn't all that interesting as a songwriter. The songs on this effort for the most part range from the inconsequential to just plain silly (for example, ""Egg Cream,"" ""Hooky Wooky,"" which are just as lightweight as their titles suggest.) Even when he tries to be controversial, such as with the provactively titled ""Sex With Your Parents,"" he manages to be only boring.Fortunately, Lou came back strong with his next studio album, ""Ecstasy,"" which is a much better purchase than this one."
5,Fantastic!,I really enjoyed this book! Fascinating book about the Essens! I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in the subject.
2,Cheesy love story,"I liked this movie despite the cheesy, tacked on love story. The battle scene at the end is great and mostly historically accurate- when you finally get there. This movie is for Civil War buffs only."
2,A pity,What a terrific film this would have been if they had just stuck to historic fact and thrown the silly love triangle out. Good pre-CGI special effects make up for some of the awfulness.
4,Great movie and history leson.,Ironclads is a great movie. My copy was still VHS and arrived in great condition in a very timely manner. I'm not sure how true to history the movie is. It does show the work of spies and what happens when caught. Great Movie.
5,A great actor and a great book,"I wasn't born yet when Bonanza was first broadcast, but it was my father's favorite show here in Brazil. Two years ago I started watching the show and I became a fan of Lorne Greene's work. After reading the book I became a fan of the human beings Lorne Greene as well. The book is very well written and easy to read. We can see how Linda Greene loved her father and with good reason: because there are no more men like that."
5,There is a reason this has ONLY received 5 stars...,"This is, believe it or not, the first book I've read in a long time dealing with spiritual issue rather than apologetics. It is brilliant! It basically expounds on the title, that God alone suffices. It discusses how we constantly rely on ourselves and have faith in our own doings etc. It has given me a different outlook on life. I can't wait to read Biela's other books."
5,Quiet Whispers,"I did not search for this book. It found me. And every time I read it, this book helps me to more deeply consider how God's gentle Love and constant Presence pervade everything, especially the most difficult situations that occur in my life and, even more, the times when He shows me who I really am. Before, I never thought about difficulties in this way. However, after reading God Alone Suffices, I have experienced how every moment of my life (even my entire past, as well as all experiences that I may have felt and still feel are difficult or painful) is a moment in which God whispers into the ears of my heart and tells me, ""I Love you, always. Nothing will change that, because I alone am Everything. I alone am Love."""
5,Great Book,This book was the best spiritual book ever. It made me really see my life from a different perspective - God's point of view. I recommend this book to everyone.
3,Mostly good,"This CD features a really strange mix of atmospheric, evocative stuff that ranges from quite listenable to clunky and boring. I love soundtracks but this one seems unusually lumpy and your mental state can get rather jarred while hopping from track to track. There is definitely some good stuff on here but it's not the kind of thing you could listen to straight through and say ""Ah, now that's what 'Heat' feels like."" Instead you say ""Hmm, was that really in the movie?""Not a bad purchase at all but some of the best tracks are available on other CDs."
4,"Excellent, but could of been better","As a hardcore fan of the movie Heat and the way Michael Mann shot the film, the soundtrack to this all time classic is excellent. I was disappointed (maybe a little too demanding) to find out that the soundtrack leaves out two very good songs from the movie: Gringatcho Demento (William Orbits; song that plays in the background in the bar after Waingro kills the prostitute and is looking for 'anything heavy'), and The Last Lagoon (William Orbits; song that plays in the background when Neil goes to get Eadee, after the bank heist, when he's chasing her up the hill as she tries to escape). Overall, the soundtrack is a great addition to owning the VHS/DVD of the movie."
5,Where's Ligeti?,"First, this was an amazing movie with amazing music. I write only to complain that the soundtrack lacks Gyorgi Ligeti's amazing cello concerto heard in part during the stakeout scene in which Neil's crew attempts to steal metals while Pacino's guys observe. I assume Ligeti is unfamiliar to most. This is unfortunate. Ligeti deserves your attention, particularly if you enjoy 20th c. avant-garde classical music or atmospheric electronic music. His music is challenging and definitely an acquired taste but very rewarding. If you like ""different"" and want to expand your musical palette, check out Ligeti. Read some reviews by smarter people than I, and start w/ his Cello Concerto if you enjoy atmospheric electronic music. But be forewarned, Ligeti is not your mother's Mozart!"
5,"Epic, moving and very powerful","This soundtrack captures the raw power and sinister feeling of the excellent movie. Anyone who likes the film should love this CD, the tracks by Moby on numbers 11 and 21 are really cool. This CD packs enough quality to make it a worthwhile purchase."
4,"Review of ""Tips at Your Fingertips""","As a relative newcomer to the area of tutoring adult learners, I have found this guide to be extremely helpful. I volunteer at a rather small literacy center and have received very little guidance in terms of strategies that would best help our students. Tips at Your Fingertips was a revelation and I have already begun to implement some of the ideas. I have even suggested at tutor team meetings that the center purchase copies for the other tutors. Its ""environmental"" or real world learning approach fits with the philosophy of our particular organization so the strategies found in the book have certainly reinforced what we are attempting to do."
2,God aweful,"It's a shame. I had such high hopes for this documentary but the pacing and sparse narrative makes it almost unwatchable. The documentary makers also suffer from a strong Mahayana bias when discussing Buddhist philosophy-- mention Buddha-nature when discussing Burmese Buddhism?!? I think not. Alas, this film isn't worth your time."
2,it's ok at best,"the only reason why I was interested in this soundtrack was because of R.Kelly's ""Freak Tonight"" that Sampled Mtume's ""Juicy Fruit"".it works pretty good for the track.but for the most part this SOundtrack is pretty forgettable just like the film."
2,Not Worth The Money!,"This CD is not worth the money. It was a lousy movie and a lousy soundtrack. There is a lot better soundtracks you can buy. Try something more recent like Big Mommas House Soundtrack. This CD has a couple of good songs, so I gave it a couple of stars."
4,Nice album,"Honestly I only like maybe 5 tracks on this album. The opening song is tight, there is a lil variation between it and the version in the film. Come Over by Sandra St. Victor is hands down the best song on the album. My favorites: 1, 2, 4, 9, 10, 11, 13-15. Tevin Campbell's song is alright.Okay, so maybe I like more than 5 tracks! I only got the album for the first song, but it really surprised me and I'm glad to add it to my collection."
5,Got Pilgrim's Progress quickly,"Wow. The modern version is excellent.I have long thought that people need to fear a higher being and feel thatthey are observed at all times. Laws just won't do it.And I feel Pilgrims Progress helps make that point,although from a more positiveperspective.Pilgrims Progress is a classic and not long, so everyone, really, everyone, should read it."
1,Watered down,"Read Pilgrim's Progress, by all means, but not this 'adapted' version. What will they do next, translate Shakespeare to make it more 'accessible?' Awful."
1,Better off with the real thing,"As someone who is pretty outspoken about the modern translations of the Bible (hate them) I see that PP has been flayed alive in like manner and had all the poetry taken out. If you must read what is essentially a beautifully written evangelical tract, then at least get the beautifully written version. It was written in English to begin with; it never needed a 'translation,' and certainly not one this flaccid."
3,Fascinating But Missing Something,"This book struck a horror into me that none of Anne Rice's novels ever did--they exposed the god-like role vampires played in human life. Strieber's vampires see human beings the way we see chickens and cows and they see copulation with a human as disgusting as we see bestiality. What's even more horrifying is that the reader is led to sympathize with the evil Miriam Blaylock, whether he/she wants to or not.The downfall of this book is that the author often moved too quickly in his descriptions. There wasn't enough information about the vampire's pasts so it leaves the reader quite hungry for backstory. Besides that, I'd give recommend it to a friend because it's not boring and it's extremely creative.-LV"
2,Disappointed,"I found that the book ""The Last Vampire"" was somewhat confusing and disappointing. Where is tells you one thing in the first book, ""The Hunger"" it tells you a different story in ""The Last Vampire"". It doesn't start where the other story finishes. Where she usually goes from male to female to male to female companion, she doesn't do this in the next box. It's jumbled and I found that I was quite disappointed in the whole thing. I wouldn't recommend it. She talks of her mother dying one way in ""The Hunger"" and then ""The Last Vampire"" she seems to have died a totally different way altogether. The author needs to keep the story straight."
2,Very predictable,"The title says it all - I got about half way through the book before I had figured out most of the ending. At that point, I read the last 10 pages, confirmed my suspcions and put it down again, never to pick it up. The beginning was fine, even interesting. But once you hit the 5th or 6th chapter, it all goes down hill. The only redeeming quality this book has, actually, is the way the author infuses moments in history and literature with these creatures he writes about. Other wise, don't bother dropping money on this title, or at least wait until it comes out as a mass market paperback."
2,"Great start, disappointing ending.","I was disappointed. The book starts well, has a facinating sense of Vampire as truely alien, truely predator. It comes apart about halfway through. The human characters just become completely implausible. I was sorry I spent my time finishing it."
2,Is Strieber obsessed with lesbian aliens?,"Though initially The Last Vampire grabbed my attention, it devolved quickly (as do most of Striber's books) into an inane example of what a generally good writer produces when out of fresh ideas. It seems that Mr. Strieber has been out of fresh ideas ever since he switched gears from the original Hunger and Wolfen by switching to the alien themes of Communion et al. He allows this theme to slip ino The Last Vampire in minute threads throughout. This, intertwined with his emphasis on Lesbian sex (which was done well in the movie version of The Hunger) gives The Last Vampire an unorganized read."
1,"Whatever this is, it isn't a sequel.","I am a tremendous fan of Mr. Streiber's work and ""the Hunger"" is my favorite novel of his, favorite vampire novel period. It is beautiful, stunning, and the character of Miriam Blaylock is a unique and memorable creation. I wrote and told him so, for what it's worth. I have read it over a dozen times. Mr. Streiber would have done well to have reread the first novel before starting the second. The character and the world they inhabit, even that facts as presented in the first novel seem completely absent. Same names but that is the only resemblence. Any art or magic he may have created in the first book is gone from the second. This second novel feels more like a body count video game or a bad ""Blade"" rip off.I don't know if he was writing with the intent of eventually making it into an action movie but that's what it feels like.It's sad. I refuse to consider this a sequel to such a fine novel."
4,"Truly satisfying, except the ending","I just loved this cover, reminiscint(sp) of the newer 'Salems Lot cover, and I love vampire novels. This one also gives new meaning to the vampire lore with the Keepers, an ancient race who have manipulated humans into the ideal food. As the CIA starts to train its own covert vampire hunters, we find out more about the Keepers and Miriam, the main vamp in this novel. The ending is a bit contrived, but the rest of the novel is absolutely wonderful. I now need to go back and pick up the Hunger.Thanks for reading!**Pandora"
1,just the facts,"The one thing that really bothered me most about this book is the author couldn't keep any of his facts straight. As a sequel, the writer has a responsablity to keep faithful to his original book, Strieber did not do this. The end was also just horrible, just an excuse for another sequel where I'm sure the story background will change once again."
1,Anne rice ripoff,"Considering how stand alone the hunger was, it was obvious that one day a sequel would be inevitable, unfortunately this sequel instead of being stand alone like its predecssor, is nothing but an Anne Rice ripoff."
1,Un-ergonomic touchpad!,"While the split keyboard may be more restful to the wrists, the touchpad is extremely awkward to use. The clicker has been moved from below the touchpad to the left of it. Since I usually use my right hand on the touchpad of my Powerbook, that means I either need to squinch my hand all the way over to the left to use the clicker -- which is difficult and painful -- or tap the keyboard to ""click"" the mouse; which is fine until you need to ""click and hold down."" I'm sending this back if I can."
1,wheels of life by anodea judith,i'm looking for that not wheels of survival...but i would be interested... same author? printed when? i would think w-out reviewing it ..wheels of survival is a spin off of wheels of life. anyway..i figure ya got my address..if not..garrett46@hot1.net
1,Dumb,Confused this with another movie called American Beer; decided to watch it anyhow. Got through the first 20 minutes and fast forwarded the rest. I am now using the DVD as a coaster. Worst movie ever!
5,"Beautiful, uplifting, modern, joyful songs.","The first Sisters album came to me by chance, and it was a true experience of joyful melody and deep-felt harmony. I was so happy to find this second album - just as good as the first. I am desperate to find out whether a third album is in the works. Does anyone know?"
2,"Jaundiced, self-edifying story","I read this book some years ago. I thought I had also already sent in a review. In short, I recall that Owens said that King was just like anyone else. Bit of a stretch. While filled with facts, the way that Owens perceives many of them left me with the thought that he must have had some private axe to grind with the LAPD management. I might have met Owens at some point in my own 30 years on the LAPD, but have no recollection of him. It does appear though that his own view and participation in questionable officer conduct leaves him with little credibility except into that acquiesence. It's an interesting story he wove, but in my experience not a pervasive one. But read it. If you're naive and not experienced inside the LAPD, it sounds reveiling."
4,sweet n sassy indeed!!,"this isnt just appetizers! but a full course meal about this doyenne of domesticity. I had no idea that martha could be so cruel and i am also boycotting Kmart for their association with this kaiser of housekeeping. but, back to the book, Oppenheimer really did a fantastic job reporting the facts. very entertaining. It was a good thing! great bathroom reading!"
2,One of Martha's recipes is worth more than this whole book,"Why does America love to bash MS?Is it because she's one ofthe few popular(or at least widely distributed) alternativestothe lowest common denominator drivel shoveled at us by the likes of Disney, McDonalds, and USA Today? Whatever failing she has, she's not in jail, and this is a free country, where clawing your way to the top is admired, at least in men.Save your money, or better still buy one of Martha's books instead."
1,"MS no angel in the house - well, DUH!!","Jerry O.'s book has undubitably revealed that Martha is a b----h of the first water. What did y'all expect?! Any woman who transforms coffee filters into paper roses ought to be pretty good at manufacturing an effective and profitable Goddess-of-the-Hearth image out of a sad and sordid personality. All the myth-bashers who gloat over her exposure in this book might also enjoy taking down Christmas trees in January and telling kids the Easter Bunny doesn't exist. No sane person could do everything that Martha does, but why be so hostile about her pretense? Relax and enjoy the fantasy, Jerry, and save your bile for the real baddies."
4,MS makes Leona Helmsley seem like a very nice person,"If one-tenth of this book is true, it makes a certain ""hotelier"" look very, very nice in comparison to MS. I've sometimes envied her creativity and energy, but if the book is accurate, the depth of her reported neurosis makes me grateful for my ""lesser gifts"". Sometimes it it difficult to look in a mirror with honesty, but the reflection is nonetheless revealing of one's true image"
1,Feel sorry for Oppenheimer,"Poor Jerry Oppenheimer - his book about Martha Stewart shows that SHE is a first rate entrepreneur and Renaissance woman, and that HE is a third rate writer. He didn't intend it that way, of course, but somehow his misogyny got in the way. When Martha succeeds in becoming the first young woman to get into her high school calculus class, she becomes ""pushy."" When she cuts her hair, she wants to be a man. When she gets a hysterectomy at age 41 after years of painful menstruation, she is supposed to be rejecting her womanhood. We've heard all this before.Oppenheimer's attempt to make Martha into an ogre by quoting disgruntled associates and relatives, merely proves how difficult it is get along as an equal when one is extremely creative and successful. I'm waiting for a writer who can capture the essence of Martha's gifts and her humanity. Martha's books and other offerings have enriched my life many times over; Oppenheimer's not at all."
1,Give me a break!,"I picked up this book because I am interested and intregued by Martha Stewart and wanted to know what all of the fuss is about. What I got was the most poorly written peice of trash I have ever wasted my time and money on! Oppenheimer should take along hard look at his grammer, speech and petty nature. It was disasterous!"
3,It's NOT a Good Thing-being Martha Stewart,"Martha Stewart is...where do you start? She's a fascinating woman who has made it BIG in the business world but has stepped on just about everyone she has ever met if you can believe everything you read in this book. Although you admire her somewhat you are mostly left with a sour taste in your mouth after reading the descriptions of her work and family relationships. What bothers me most is how little credit Ms. Stewart has given anyone else in her world. Her relationships with her ex-husband, parents, siblings and most importantly her daughter are based on much research by the author. The amount of research shows. While fact-filled the book is only somewhat interesting and could have been shorter. We learned more than we wanted to about Ms. Stewart."
4,Just Desserts is (a) good dish!,"Who cares whether or not Martha is a controlling, conniving diva? Nothing I read really surprised me; I've always suspected Martha Stewart of reinventing herself. The fact is, this is one fascinating woman! But she can't possibily be as one-dimensional as she appears to be. She must have some good traits! The author should have worked harder to find balance. She can't be all nasty - can she"
2,Over the top negative,"I can imagine the same book, with the same information, being written with an objective or positive voice. However, the author takes elaborate and sometimes silly steps to make everything Martha has done look sinister. For example, when she worked three jobs to pay her own way through college (including being a maid) he referred to her as ""hustling"" for money. Too many anonymous sources made it sometimes confusing to keep track of who he was quoting, plus he relied too heavily on a disgruntled brother for information. Finally, the book which took great pains to paint her so harshly ends rather abruptly with little or no insight or final thoughts. Still, it was a fun read and I laughed at the exaggerated writing style on several occasions."
2,The Beatles 'Live at the BBC' is thin on content,"The Beatles BBC songbook is unfortunately, just another Beatles songbook. It contains 25 selections from the compact disk release of the same name. Part of the charm of the CD is listening to the Beatles' cover tunes such as Ray Charles' 'I got a woman' and the Coasters' 'Young Blood'. Here the Beatles belt out some of the songs that inspired them to become musicians themselves, as well as many Beatles originals. Out of the 25 songs in the songbook, only twelve are cover songs. All of these songs, with the exception of Lennon & McCartney's 'I'll be on my way', can be found in almost any other Beatles' songbook, making the Beatles BBC songbook somewhat of a disappointment. It would have been a more complete compilation of Beatles' tunes, unlike any other, if they had included more of the cover songs. However, for the ""must have"" Beatles collector I would recommend shopping around."
1,Where is the Tablature Version?,"The Canadian Amazon.ca seems to show the same book but as a recorded version. Is there in fact a tab version for ""Live at the BBC"" and what songs does it contain? Hopefully it is all cover songs as there are already many Beatles books with their own material. I am in agreement with the writer above 100%. If this book was in tablature and had all cover songs from the double album I would certainly buy it!"
4,A fine little book,"This is a fine little book on African hunting. It is a bit outdated. As such some of the names of places and animals which have changed in the past 40 years will leave some readers wondering. All in all though it is fine reading. Covers many species, such as the smaller antelopes, which are commonly overlooked in safari books. This book is suitable for younger readers interested in African hunting, or hunting in general. It's small size and easy reading style make it particularly apealing to the teen and pre-teen reader, but do not take this to mean it is a kid's book. It's not!TE"
5,a wounderful book for all students of aikido,i think this book is a brilliant book for all students studying aikido and for students of all grades from beginner to advanced. this book is a book on shodokan aikido and even though i study tomiki aikido i found this book extremly useful for the recent katsura international championship in october 2005. this book is not a book for teaching the advance principles but to teach the basic principles of shodokan aikido because most books i have read are teaching the advanced principles and kata's but this book teaches the basic kata's and principles.i do really think anyone studing aikido would benefit from reading this book because when i read this book i really did benefit from it and it really has improved my aikido over the last couple of years. i would recomend this book to all students of tomiki & shodokan aikido.
3,"Not a bad mix, but very loose Interpretation of Acoustic","This is an enjoyable set of songs, but do not reflect the song list given above, that is for the 2004 (blue cover) Pure Acoustic. However, if your an acoustic purest, you will be disappointed, it seems the only qualification to be ""acoustic"" was it must have an acoustic instrument some where in the song, no matter how much synth lead in there is."
3,great show... not a great box set.,"Don't let the ""season 4"" in amazon's heading decieve you. When I recieved this item I was extremely disappointed to find that this is not the complete fourth season. I don't exactly know how they have the episodes catagorized but this ""starter set"" actually includes episodes 1-4[The Big Shrink, The Kidnapped Debutante, Beware of Idols, Fish Marks the Spot] on the first disc and then spisodes 53-55[The Mist Goblin Murder Part I, The Mist Goblin Murder Part II, Weapon Of Choice] on the second disc. I was very disappointed because I actually already own both of these DVDs! It wasn't very clear what was included, and while I assumed I was going to have two copies of 4.1[the second disc] I didn't think I was only getting 1.1[the first disc] as well!"
2,Depressing as Hellfire,"Joe Meno clearly has a lot of talent---far more than the proofreader who allowed the abundance of typos in the book to slide by---but the end result is rather disappointing. Not only is the main character's thought pattern and point of view often difficult to follow, but I never truly felt as though I got to know any of the characters. Although Meno has a real flair for detail in scenes where heavy action action is occurring, large chunks of the prose drift by like zombies, never making an impression or creating better understanding of the characters. The author makes the mistake of showing rather than telling far too often to give readers a chance to see things through the eyes of these underdeveloped characters. The result is a story that drives home only a feeling of confused hopelessness, rather than fulfillment."
2,This first attempt never quite gets off the ground.,"Meno's book entices you with savory characters and gritty prose, but suffers badly from a recurring point of view problem. As you read, you have the sense that with the start of each chapter, the narrator forgets everything he's previously told his audience. The magical connection writers create with their reader is dangled in front of us in one chapter and then snatched away in the next by this out of touch narrator. A sharp editor's pen could have reduced the redundancy of overdone description, and helped this first time novelist move through a narrative that mattered to the reader. A collection of short stories may have been a wiser choice for St. Martin's."
4,"""Hellfire"" powerfully conveys the loneliness of childhood.","This book is about loneliness, and the ways we fight it. The stories savage all our comforting beliefs -- our parents can always protect us; the Midwest is peaceful; religion provides comfort -- and proves psychologist Sheldon Kopp's verdict: Childhood is a nightmare. Joe Meno writes with such power that you can't put this book down, no matter how much you wish you could."
1,Trash from a small mind,"Joe grew up in Evergreen Park, IL. Anyone who read the book and knows the village & his school can identify most of the characters. It's like a characture written by a cynical observer to life; not someone content with himself."
3,Acceptable after some mods.,"This holder fits a regular harmonica, but is rough on the neck. I modified it by using some automotive tubing as a cushion and it's much better. Can't be made to fit a ""tube type"" harmonica. Springs are almost too stiff, and it's hard to insert the harp."
4,Works great,"Previously purchased the one that Hohner makes, which is of higher quality. However, it did not hold the harp in place very well."
2,lee oskar harmonica holder,"this harmonica holder is ok, but is is very hard to enter a harmonica into it, the holding springs are way too stiff."
4,Pretty Good,"My complaints about this holder are that the way the screw turns on the left is counter-intuitive and it's hard to get your harmonica in and out of the spring clamp, I've even had my harmonica bent a couple of times because it's gotten caught in the wrong way.But besides those complaints it's a good product and I'd recommend it."
4,Mouth organ holder,"I bought this as a gift and the recipient has been, and continues to be very pleased with it.He had tried another brand so he has a base to compare too and he is very pleased with this brand product."
1,GREAT FOR A GIRAFFE,Tried every possible adjustment. I have to lean my head so far up to get to the harp to play... it is ridiculous.Sent it back
1,USELESS!!!!,"I like the design, but the springs are WAY TOO TIGHT!! The LEE OSKAR CO. should re-work this product. It is USELESS to me."
4,"Wish the flashlight was white, not red, otherwise perfection!","This knife makes anyone's life easier. Buy it now, because you can't go wrong with it!My wife gave me one of these a couple of years ago, and I can't go a day without it. I use it all the time. At work, I use it to cut open the tape on boxes, use the scissors to cut excess threads on buttons and the hairs that the barber missed, use the Phillips driver to get at computer parts (it has a magnetic tip, which is really nice), the pen to cross items off the grocery list. The uses go on and on. A great thing to have in your pocket, and it is tiny for the amount of utility it affords. If it had a white flashlight instead of red, I would have given it 5/5. The red light is its biggest shortcoming, which is still pretty minor."
4,Lo-Tel The Lost Thing CD,"Seeing how it was the last one in stock anywhere, with the price I was reluctant to purchase, I was hoping to barter or bid, it's a cool cd though, my old copy disappeared,it arrived within two weeks in good condition, no scratches.Thanks for sending.Cheers."
5,very beautiful album..,i have their first album*planet of the stereo*.which i think is the best music ever came out from australia!this album is more better than the first!far more mature!but very beautiful!Buy this album if you into indie pop music!the music here heartful melody with genious song writing!get this album now!
4,Avetts create their own genre...,"Unfortunately, I only recently discovered The Avett Brothers. Having said that, this album is what convinced me that they were going to be a staple in my music collection. The Avett's have, in my opinion, created their own genre of music. Whether you consider it Honky-Tonk, Bluegrass, Alt-Country, or Folk Rock, it is a feast for the ears. Their musical talents run the gambit of inventive and honest songwriting to emotion-filled vocals to clever musicianship. I could kick myself for not finding these guys a long time ago. If you are looking to start your Avett Experience, start with this album. It will facilitate a newfound respect in music."
2,Missing the point,"This is quite depressing and demeaning, it seems designed to get people to be pacific and melancholy, without significant hopes. Parts seem to brag, in other parts I think the musicians sound vein. I like the cover art, the 5 symbols remind me of synagogue windows."
4,awesome,"after buying ""i and love and you"" last fall i have become a huge avett bros fan. i have purchased their last several recordings and enjoyed each and every one. ""Four Thieves"" is a raw sample of their work as long time ""bros"" fans already know. if you are a fan of the avett bros i would strongly recommend adding this recording to your collection."
2,Why do they think I'd find their gigling interesting?,"Some of the songs I enjoy, some of their newer stuff I love BUT I don't want to here them laughing on outtakes. To me it's the height of pretension to think I anyone wants to hear that crap. Have a little more respect for your fans! We're not all sycophants."
1,not so hot,"I saw these guys at an art festival last year. I'm all for high energy and making old sounds new, but these guys just seemed like hipsters playing really loud and without much substance. ""Hey, I have an idea - punk rock on a banjo!"" Wow, that's a new one. You need to have something more than that to make interesting music. This album seems a tad more subtle than their live show, but not much. LATER EDIT: Though I stand by my opinion, and by the right of people to write a negative review (it's just an opinion - we're not arguing about objective reality), I do kinda regret my smart alecky tone here. The music struck me as shallow and not very interesting, but I could have found a more civil way to say it. I'm glad there was 1 among 18 people who found my review helpful, though. I often find negative reviews helpful, even when I don't agree with the reviewer's opinion!"
5,Birthday Present,I got this for my friend for her birthday and she couldn't be more pleased with the quality and product :)It also shipped fast.
3,Not What I Expected,"I discovered the Avett Brothers reading an article on Ramseur Records. In doing further research, I discovered the Avett brothers were former guitar students of a good friend and the Avett family are friends with he and his wife. ""Four Thieves Gone"" was more or less a random pick of their albums. I read the Avett Brothers had a popular stage performance and played a rock'n bluegrass so I was expecting music more akin to something like the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. I have not listened to the band's other albums or a performance. But I didn't hear anything in this albums that would fit the stage performance image in the article. ""Four Thieves Gone"" may have been an studio experiment for the Avett Brothers....something like the Beattles' White Album was for the Beattles. I enjoy the album quite a bit but I am not sure fans of modern day bluegrass or even rock will agree."
5,Great Novel,This novel is fairly short and an easy read. You will enjoy it and it makes you think outside of the box. Read it.
3,Part of a series,"The regiment series is (IMO) an average of four stars, and white regiment almost got that, but there was something lacking comparative to the earlier books which I find hard to pin down. Well worth reading though."
2,Not impressed,The side interior walls of this saucepan have a horizontal texture that produce a grating feel/sound which sends shivers up my spine whenever I use it with a metal spoon. Beyond that it is just an average saucepan of similar quality to what you would get from ikea at the same price. It also lacks any kind of branding which I thought was odd.
5,Breathtaking...,"I simply cannot begin to describe how perfect an LP this is. 'No Easy Way Down' and 'Everything is Beautiful' are touching enough to reduce anyone to tears.I can only hope that Eitzel's life and songwriting career will not go the same way as that of Nick Drake. Having seen him perform live in Edinburgh, it amazes me that a man of such talent can remain relatively unknown for so long!This - like virtually all Eitzel / AMC releases - is a must buy."
5,Printhead,I had no issues with this item. Replaced the old printhead with this printhead and my printer/plotter is back up and running.
2,Not Worth the Money as a Study Guide For PLT,"This Praxis review is not worth the money. The review of PLT key words and terms was okay. The major problem with this particular study guide were the questions that were asked during the practice tests. The example test questions are not structured like the actual PLT K-6 questions. Many of the sample questions given in the study guide were opinion based, the Praxis PLT is not opinion based. One good thing about the study guide is the CD that comes with it, although the questions are not like the actual test, the sample test on the CD does count time down. This makes a little pressure and helps with time management."
5,before harry potter there was this book,"i read this book when i was a kid and it was just so cool. i must have checked out this book a dozen times. this book reminds me of something thast would have influenced rk rowling. it is so british, has the eerie fog and magic, waaay cool book. great reading for kids."
4,Solid sharpening kit,"I got this kit to sharpen my woodworking chisels and plane blades. It's worked quite well so far. The honing guide requires careful adjustment to get the blade square, but it's not that hard to do so. The stone is a bit gritty, but that's fine with me. If you're looking for a decent cheap sharpening kit, this one is a solid choice. You might also check Rockler for the Irwin/Marple equivalent of this, which a friend of mine bought and is happy with."
4,Liked it so much I bought a new one.,"This is a reasonably cheap and good little sharpening guide. It is not fantastically robust (the plastic guide on mine broke, making selecting the correct angle difficult but not impossible), but for someone who sharpens his tools only a few times a year, it is perfectly adequate. It works well on my Stanley plane blade, easily taking out a notch caused by a hidden metal fragment and it cleaned up and sharpened my chisels extremely well. It takes a little care to set it up properly, but all in all it is excellent value for money."
2,"Nice size but poor stone, soft and dusty","I initially rated this stone highly but after using it for a few weeks I have found it to be too soft and dusty to be much use for chisels or blades. The size is awesome and I am able to sharpen blades fairly well but it is difficult, and spews powder residue all over on the rough side. The fine side is useless.I really wanted it to be GOOD AMERICAN QUALITYits not.STANLEY should drop any poor suppliers ASAP while their name still has some shine on it. Their TOOLS so far are still good.This stone is not."
1,Don't Do It!,"I consider this a total waste of money for the very simple reason that it is imposible to clamp a chisel or plane blade squarely. There is no straight edge to register the edge of the blade on. Also, the wheels are remarkably cheap plastic. I am going to buy one of the standerd ""vise"" style guides."
3,Easy to use but quality is iffy,"I bought this mostly for the honing guide since I already have diamond sharpening stones. The honing guide works well but the quality is not there. It does work but your have to hold it carefully.Just for kicks, I took a look at the stone and mine was totally flat so I didn't need to flatten the stone at all. I haven't used it yet but that was surprising since most cheap stones don't come completely flat."
3,A good sharpening system,"I am attempting to become better a sharpening my chisels and plane blades. I bought this set to begin with because the price was reasonable and I felt I it would help me learn. The blade holder/vise I would characterize as a beginners set. It is not easy to hold the blade straight at at the right angle. A plane blade or chisel move out of position very eazily so care must be taken to use this system. I have been successful in sharpening a plane blade; however, it was not as easy as I had expected. Another issue was the oil that the stone absorbed. The small bottle provided was quickly absorbed by the stone. As I become better at sharpending, I will replace this system quickly."
1,Sharp,"The item is poorly machined and fitting the chisle in the guide, especially since clear directions were non-existant. Very disappointed with the item."
4,Post-modern Istanbul,"Uzuner takes the lead from Borges, Sabato et al and transforms seemingly unimportant narratives into intense internal examinations of character and the nature of belonging. Recommended most highly. Tragically, most of her Turkish work remains untranslated (PHD students seeking a thesis take note!) but this is a good start for readers diving into the richness of modern TurkLit."
2,Flawed Diamond - a warning to US customers,"Sadly, ""Gabriella's Song"" and ""Fly With Me (Lena's Song)"" aren't as heard in the movie, but ""enhanced"" with drums, keyboard and the like - apparently altered to be more appealing for the general public and music charts, but the songs have definitely lost their touch. You should even be able to listen to parts of the songs online on German amazon.de - search for ""Wie im Himmel [Soundtrack]""I feel like I have to warn US customers about this, as European Amazon is full with disappointed customer reviews. There's simply no excuse for not including the authentic unplugged versions.Otherwise a fine soundtrack, with my favorite being the marvelous ""As it is in Heaven""."
1,Not Effective for Flat Warts,"I've gone through two bottles of Warts No More, without much to show for results. Actually, nothing I've found so far gets rid of flat warts, including spending hundreds of dollars on Aladara prescribed by a dermatologist. (The only result of the Aladra was to make me susceptible to a raging staph infection.) The Warts No More liquid smells like turpentine, so you don't want to put it on if you're headed to work.Covering warts with duct tape has more impact than the application of Warts No More. For that matter, wrapping a small piece of cotton soaked in vinegar (either white or apple cider) around the warts has more impact than Warts No More.Save your money and try the vinegar first."
3,"Seems OK, willing to continue the treatment",I just used it for 1 week. The warts become smaller and drier. I think this is good result for 1 week treatment. I just ordered the 33ml size. I'll tell you the progress. Hopefully it works.
3,Looking GOOD so far,"After sending me the wrong product thus wasting 21 days of treatment, Forces of Nature (California) did resend the ordered Warts No More Extra promtly + at no charge. After 1 week, it looks like it may be working. I need a few more weeks to be positive. My foot doctor hopes it works because the alternatives are not so terrific."
1,do not waste your money !,"This product does not work, none of these products from this company work, do not waste your money on them. I wish that I had not wasted my money on them!"
1,Use Hylands instead,Wish someone had warned me that this product could cause choking. Just use teething pellets and try to use this only during awake time and when not being fed.
2,Cheep Lens,"Received the lens and it has a flaw on it. Could not get it replaced. Guess you get what you paid for, I would say spend a little extra money and get a good lens."
4,Sigma 55-22mm zoom,It was a Christmas present for my wife. Excellent quality.Sigma 55-200mm f/4-5.6 DC Telephoto Zoom Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras
4,A word of warning.,"This lens is great for the money, a word of warning, it will not autofocus with the D40, D40x, or D60."
3,It's okay for the $$$$$,The lens is average. The zoom quality is mediocre and the edges do get a tad fuzzy. You get what you pay for. It will do what I need for the time in which I have it.
2,What I received wasn't what I ordered.,The listing indicates that this is an auto-focus (AF) lens. The box and the documentation that came all indicated that it was an AF lens. The actual lens itself was not an AF lens. I don't know if this was just a mistake on someones part (accidentally put the wrong lens in the box) or what. I was very disappointed. I ended up returning it and purchasing theNikon 55-200mm f/4-5.6G ED IF AF-S DX VR [Vibration Reduction] Zoom Nikkor Lensfor $65 more and I am very happy with it. I will say that the quality of the Sigma lens itself was very acceptable for a budget oriented lens. It fit well and operated smoothly. The Amazon return process was very easy and went smoothly - I appreciated that.
5,SIGMA 55-200,Sigma 55-200mm f/4-5.6 DC Telephoto Zoom Lens for Nikon Digital SLR CamerasI GOT THIS RIGHT AFTER I GOT MY CAMERA AND IT IS WELL WORTH THE MONEY GREAT LENS FOR THE PRICE
2,Not Really Great.,Coast Guard ships are on duty in all sizes; up to 400-foot plus lengths. This DVD refers only to those up to 110 feet. Incomplete inventory of what the USCG actually sails.
3,"Thus far, so so to fair",I have been using this but as of this point have not really noticed a difference in my hair. I will continue usage to determine if I purchase it again. Thank you.
3,Excellent shoe... until the sole falls off,"Similar to others who have reviewed this item, Dr. Martens are good shoes. But my left sole separated from the shoe as well. A $100 shoe should NOT ever do this, and definitely not after only 6 months of occasional wear. I'm a professor, and I walk around campus a little, but it's not like these shoes have been worn a lot or had a hard life. I had sketchers that lasted much longer for MUCH less money.I really hope this company goes back to making their shoes in reliable factories. Most of us would pay more to get shoes that are of the quality that we expect, made by craftsmen who really know what they are doing."
1,not steel toe,I buy this shoe because i need steel toe but it not.Did you ship wrong once? Can someone check this out.Thank you.
4,wonderful cream,"I have battled eczema for years. Despite the creams that I have received from the dermatologist, this seems works just as well if not better for a non steroid cream. I highly recommend this to anyone who suffers from severe dry skin or skin conditions like mine. Plus it has a pleasant scent."
3,I think Ice Age is at an end,"Saw this movie in an all digital theatre in 3D and still thought it was just okay. When are they going to make a movie with Scrat as the main character. I feel like they tried very hard to usurp him into the screen time much more, however I think the magic is gone from the herd of various animals sticking together. The only character which doesnt currently drive me nuts to hear their voice is John Leguiziamo. The pirates were fresh, but really they need to go back to square one on this idea"
4,OK kid-flick,"I saw this one with a tween-age girl, so the ""my parents don't understand"" message worked pretty well - for her, at least. Cue the familial alienation plot, with predictable rapprochement in the end. There's a big, healthy ""stand by your friends"" message, too.OK, so the story was commodity material, or maybe one notch above. The animation was great, though. The CGI folks really have complex figures, motions, and textures down, and did a fantastic job with fur and hair. This one's popcorn-worthy, but it really helps to be with a kid in the target demographic.-- wiredweird"
5,Family,"Funny, entertainment would recommend this movie to adults and kids, the squirrel is really funny in all three movies love it"
4,This is as good as the first two Ice Age movies,"That poor little rodent is still at it. He's got so many problems but he pushes on and never gives up. The rest of the ""herd"" is still there plus the addition of Grannie who is just too funny to miss out on. Get the movie. Entertain yourself."
3,kids loved it,enjoyed aher haerh erg eth rthjr jety kjtey ketyk etyj rtj th er gdsf va sv rge her thwr j
2,dumb,"This was a really dumb movie, one of the worst Ice Age movies. Would not buy it or watch it again."
4,good movie,"good movie for my kids, they love it. wish the writers had done more with the theme and story as we all love the Ice age stories"
3,Not as good as the original?,"I decided to give this a try as it was a rainy, dismal day and AZ.com had it on sale for $1.99. I watched it... it was not nearly as funny or interesting as the first two Ice Age flix. A few new characters and a brief appearance by Sid's family was good for a few chuckles but I would not care to see it again. Kids will probably like it... my advice rent it yes, buy it No Thanks.."
3,Cute,"Cute family film, but lesser quality than the original Ice Age. Adults can enjoy the film as well. Always enjoy Scrat!"
2,Not worth watching.,The movie is made to merely entertail the children without much scientific context. I am sure how it relates to the title!
4,Good movie for the family,"Looking for a movie for the family, sometihng for me and my 2 boys (3 yrs and 9 yrs) it was a good choice."
5,Good wholesome entertainment,I like that I can plug these in and not have to censure when to turn it off or herd the kids out of the room. These are amusing DVD's that are great for everyone.
5,Not just another Ice Age Movie.,"Although I have never been disappointed with the Ice Age series this story brings to it even more emotion and entertainment!Every actor (voice) is perfect! My favorite of course is Sid. These episodes provide the whole family with exciting and humorous entertainment.This story based on Glacial movement and as the title suggests Continental drift. Introducing piracy, slavery, and bravery. The introduction of new characters help to keep these stories fresh and perhaps set the stage for even more adventures!"
5,ADORABLE,"A great children's video :) the storyline is light and fun with strong, positive ethos. If you've a little one, this is a good bet. :)"
3,"Same movie, again","Why did this do another version of this movie? It's all the same. This version was just more violent and when you thought it could have a really nice ending, they robbed us of that too. Hint, tiger have a mate. Ug."
3,It's ok,"This completed the ste. I still think the 1st one is best ( as usual). Although, it was good. Hope there will be another."
4,Cute,My 7 y/o son loved this movie so much that we watched it over and over for 3 days. He never got tired of it.
3,Enjoyed by the family,The connection with Amazon was good and the quality of the video stream is excellent. My son loved the movie so much he asked to buy it.
4,Great!,Better than the last one! Very entertaining. Good adventure and story line. JLo does great with her character. I love Sid!
4,Entertaining family movie!,"I've seen all of the Ice Age movies with my family,(husband and children). These movies have a great story line to follow, and always teach a lesson. Amazon instant video was easy to use and no downloading is the best part. Instantly plays after purchase to enjoy watching.."
3,Fair,Would not rent again for $5 maybe rent for a dollar $1. It is your choice. The others were better
4,It was okay...,"Overall the movie was entertaining, but it was not quite as funny as the other two we watched. 3.5 to 4 stars"
5,Good family entertainment,"Another great addition to the Ice Age series. Great animation, with a funny story line, cast of characters and good family entertainment."
3,Enjoyable but not as good,Not as good as last three. Confusing and not up to the level the last three. It could have been but it got lost.
1,Torture,"I'm really sorry. We loved the first one but each subsequent one keeps getting cheesier and cheesier. And, sad to say, less entertaining. Maybe we are just getting older and older."
3,Not as fun as other Ice Age flicks but still it's Ice Age,"The plot was too predictable. (Oh, except for the climax), but the antics of the characters holds to the Ice Age tradition."
2,Disappointing ...,Did not enjoy this animation film because of the characters. No warmth in any of them which is disappointing for a children's film. Hard to get by the associations of the adult voices with previous characters they have played as well as the dialog. So many better choices out there.
5,Very cute,My kids could not take their eyes off the screen. This is a very cute movie and we all loved it
4,Frankly I'm confused,"about the lifetimes in conjunction with the ice age, and how they get around so much and where's all the land? But it's a funny crew and script, so it's not a bad way to waste an hour or so. Also, Queen Latifah."
5,Surprisingly Good for a 4th Version,The Ice Age series gets better and better. I was surprised how good the 3rd version (Dawn of Dinosaurs) but was pleasantly surprised how good the 4th one turned out. Great characters as always and Diego found a girlfriend! Definitely a great addition to our collection.
3,"Not the best one, but still good.","I felt like they tried to do too much with this one in a short amount of time. The seal, however, is laugh out loud hilarious! Of course, it's Ice Age so it's hard to go wrong, but I expected a bit more."
3,Meh,"This series is slowly devolving into a beggar asking for money at the intersection you always pass on the way to work. The kids loved it, but not much there for the 30+ crowd."
4,Good one!!,"Well, I think I mixed up and gave my review for this one to the other. Anyway, definitely watch the three of these in order so you can follow the development of the characters."
4,"Good, but not as good as the first two.","Ice Age are a good family trilogy. Clean humor on all, but this last installment was not as entertaining as the first two. Worth watching for the sense that you can depend on it as a family night, but if you have not watched the first two...from a level of entertainment, I would pass this one and view any of the other two first."
5,Ice Age:Continental Drift,This dvd has been checked out several times and everyone who checked it out really lilked the little characters..Good reviews.
4,Nephew,I bought this part 4 without realizing my nephew didn't have part 2 only 1 and 3. But it was fun to watch.
2,Not Impressed,The first three were hilarious. They dropped the ball on this one. Sorry if you were getting excited about it. But chances are you'll watch it anyway.
4,Fun family movie.,"Great movie for cuddle time with five and a half year old. Lots of giggles. Fun, cute and not too long."
4,it was funny,"I liked the Mother best, she made the movie. I am loking forward to a baby tiger next. We will see what or if there is another one"
3,Hidden Agenda's Here,"As an adult I've always liked the Ice Age movies, but I didn't like this one so much. This one seems to be geared mostly to the pre-teens/teens. Peaches is attracted to a boy Mammoth, does a bad thing to her best friend, etc.. The bullying thing comes into play as well as to like others that are not of your kind,........why do they keep shoving that down peoples throats? There is still some comedy in the movie, but ........well I don't know. See for yourself if you want, but like I said mostly for the kids if you want to let them watch it. These guys can make better movies than this, and I was really hoping for a movie length Christmas Movie, the one last year of a whole 25 minutes just didn't get it!"
4,Funny as the first one!,Very creative script. New concepts present in humorous ways. The first few minutes are the best part! Have fun watching it.
5,Great fun,These movies are great fun. The characters are strong and the humor is great. I look forward to the next movie as always.
3,"Fun, fun, yet boring",Great movie for the kids but not for adults anymore... It becomes really boring after 10 minutes yet one still can enjoy the animation.
4,Requested and very loved gift!,Our grandson requested this movie for Christmas. He was extremely happy when he opened the package. My husband watched it with our grandson. My husband didn't like it as much as he had liked the original one but that is normal. Our grandson loves it and watches it often.
3,Kind of silly ideas with sailing ice burgs,"The story was more childish than than the other stories, but of course the characters did play their parts well and it was entertaining. I want my stories to have some premise in fact so that children can be taught things, not just be a bunch of jumbled events. This was cute, but just jumbled events, thus the 3 star rating."
4,Great sequel as usual,"I would have given it 5 stars but the movie content seemed to scare my 3yr old at times. The ape character was the most likely culprit. Overall, it is a good film."
4,Ice Age/Continental Drift,"We watched this last night and really enjoyed it. Not sure if our younger grandchildred would understand some of the movie, my husband and I thought it was great."
5,Fun movie,This was a very enjoyable movie! It shows the strength of family and friends and sticking together. It also has some fun songs that will entertain both adults and children. Highly recommend!
5,Excellet addition to child entertainment.,"I have purchased the entire set of Ice Age movies, and this one made an excellent final (at least for now) addition. It begins with a very entertaining (and essential to understanding the rest of the movie) sequence about how Scrat the Squirrel nearly destroys the planet by chasing an acorn to the center of the earth. It gets better as the plot develops, and indeed it does."
2,Not a fan,"My kids loved it. For me, Ice Age was good for the first movie and all of the rest have been increasingly boring."
5,Ice age continental drift,Great children's movie with a lot of excitement my 4 yr old grandchild loves it and takes it in his amazon library wherever he goes. Amazon is great for purchasing online instant video.
4,okay,the movie looks funny. May watch it with the wife some time! Not the original but nice.We stay away from the more intense type dramas/action movies and stick with family/comedy for the sake of our mental health.
3,It's no Ice Age 1,It was entertaining but that was all. Not something I would watch again but it was fine to watch on a rainy day.
3,Not my favorite Ice Age movie,"I have to say, this is probably my least avorite Ice Age movie, but the kids seem to really like it."
3,Ice Age Continental Drift,"I wanted to watch it because I had seen all the rest of the Ice Age movies. Like all sequels, each additional one just doesn't seem to be as good as the original unless it is based on a really good book. Seemed like they were just grasping at straws and wanted to make another movie."
2,the worst ice age,"I love all the ice age movies, i mean when the third one came out i just thought that it was the best animateded movie trilogy. when i saw the trailer of the fourth one i was so exited!!! when i wached it, well lets say i didnt laugh at any point of the movie and it was very boring, thw whole pirate thing is so stupid!!!"
2,Annoying,"The content has shfted from being more centered in the real world of the Ice Age, and has drawn far too much from recent culture: hip hop, teen angst current pop references and a gooey amount of emotional sugar poured over it. Gone are the arguments and vinager that made the first three more involving and funnier. The awareness that kids are going to be watching has made this entry more preachy, and ,and three fingers in the throat for the adults watching. Only Scrat remains untouched. The science used here is nonsense, but far more accurate than Creationism."
1,Review related to Product NOT movie review,"This is one of a couple movies that come in Blu-ray and no option to be coupled with a standard DVD as well. I started purchasing Blu-ray movies for the home, but I have to make sure it had the standard DVD with it as well for car travel or watching on my laptop. I don't have a tablet that the digital download would assist with nor is it compatible with my car DVD player. As a side note, the only times my kids (both under 9 yo) get to see DVD's in the car is if we are travelling more than 2 or 3 hours., Otherwise they have books and toys to amuse themselves with or do the normal brotherly sisterly fight with each other thing too.I will gladly spend an extra few dollars buying the Blu-ray/DVD/Download set every time over having to choose between just getting the DVD because it works on my Blu-ray at home and in my car."
5,the best Ice Age,"a really cute movie. my two daughters love it (2,4). The grandma sloth is so funny, Peaches is so sweet and the pirates are great. definitely a great addition to movie collection"
1,I didn't even get to watch it!,The movie never even started. It just gave the logo and then it would turn off. I tried various times and nothing worked. First time I have been let down my instant video.
1,What a shame!!!,I have always loved the ice age movies and bought all of them. This one should have been left on the cutting room floor (realize they probably don't do films that way any more); it was a total waste of time and an insult to those of us who have been Ice Age fans since the beginning. The only possible purpose of this film would have been to make money from the reputation of the first three; I sincerely hope that there won't be an Ice Age 5 if this is the direction in which they are going with them for the future. It was truly poor.
3,Drifted off course,"Loved the other Ices, but this felt like they were working too hard to be funny and new. Not so good."
5,ice age-drift,"Great fun for family! We've enjoyed every one of the ice age flicks! Have on Kindle, phone & DVD. Recommend highly"
3,light fare,"Enjoyed the actors' - they did a great job and the animation was fabulous as usual. I think it is geared of course, for younger audiences - the story was just not quite there, perhaps it was just too trite in places for my taste."
3,Ice age,Did not think it was as good as the last ones but worth watching. Just not as funny but the story was good.
3,"Cute, fluff entertainment for a cold winter's night.","Scrat (the saber-toothed squirrel) rules! Fun movie, but not as good as the first. The monkey's a bit weird, though."
4,Good Movie,It was a nice family movie- enjoyed watching it with the kids. Would not watch again but nice to see.
5,Great Movie,This is one of the best Ice Age Movies. My 6 & 8 year old love it and I enjoy watching it wtih them.
4,Recommended,I would recommend the latest itteration of the Ice Age series for any family who enjoyed or loved the first three!
3,Ice age maybe thawing out!,"This series is great ! The kids will love it , same great characters . But I think it has ran it's course, for us adults that is. The story line is dull it's the same story as the other ice age movies, just different circumstances ."
3,Good kids movie,The movie is good. the characters are the same as before. I would recommend it for kids 8 and above.
5,Review for movie,It was very cute and kids were glued to it the whole time. Would watch it again. It was awesome.
4,Ice Age: Continental Drift,"Although it didn't have as detailed a plot as the first two, it was still ""Ice Age"" entertaining! Personally, I think the critics are nitpicking and take thinks to seriously and out of context."
3,boring...but good animation,there were some funny parts but overall it was boring and predicable. i don't think i would buy it.... sad i rented it for 4 when i could have gone to redbox and gotten it for 1. ohwell.... at least i didn't have to drive out in the snow.
3,1st one is the best,"As the title says, I think the first one is by far the best. This one carries the tradition of having Scrat steal the show but that's ok. I thought it was worth watching but I don't plan to watch it again."
5,Great service,Good service and price arrive timely and in great shape. Given as a gift for the Holidays. They enjoyed it
4,Learning my history...,I always thought squirrels were cute. I had no idea they could wreak such havoc on an innocent world. If it wasn't for them... well... you know...
4,Always enjoyable,"All the characters are so much fun to watch, even the no good meanies. Wlll Scratch (?) ever get an acron to eat?"
3,fun for the whole family,"The movie is wonderful, sid and diego is good once more but I think they could have done a little bit more, frankly the previous ones were way better."
5,Love it,This is a must see movie for adults and children. The cast is excellent. I would even recommend buying this movie!!
4,Good movie,"My daughter loves the first two movies so we picked up this one to complete her collection. While it is a good movie the story has changed with more focus on fighting amongst the two different herds. While the fighting isn't overly violent, our daughter just doesn't seem to enjoy this movie as much as the other two. I do think that it is a great value for the price, while it is the same movie, you do get four different versions of it.Shipped fast and packaged well."
2,Declining Series,"The fundamental premises of this series I find to be wrong, however, from an entertainment perspective, it seems that the quality of the first movie has continued to be missed in each successive movie produced afterwards. I don't think this is as good as the previous, which wasn't as good as it's previous movie. I'd look elsewhere as the value is very wanting in this series."
3,Continental Drift......drifted to far,"The first 3 ""Ice Age"" sagas were delightful. Continental Drift dropped the ball. Story line? boring, too many characters and the seemed to be missing the plot. Where was this supposed to go? Maybe it's time to give it up."
2,Yawn...,"I love kids movies...quality ones that is. Like Finding Nemo, Cars, The Incredibles...etc. I enjoyed the first 3 Ice Age Movies. Each one an entertaining and unique experience. But the 4th Ice Age is kind of bland...kind of a yawn. I found it easy to leave the room without pausing the DVD so I didn't miss anything when I went for snacks. I didn't connect with the characters or story like I have with the others...didn't really care what happened. Seemed more like an ""After School Special"" than a Blockbuster..."
2,"Predictable, even the kids couldn't watch till the end","These stars obviously did this one for the money. My family was very disappointed, they loved the other Ice Age movies, but this one is best avoided and rewatch the old ones"
5,Hilarious,It is absolutely adorable. Great addition to the Ice Age Family of movies. Exactly what you would want it to be.
4,Nice movie,Rented this for the grandson to watch. Good entertainment for a six year old! Has many of the same characters and several new ones. My grandson loved the music.
4,Great family fun!,"The best Ice Age movie yet! Love the additional characters ~ the pirates were well developed, funny and added immensely to the storyline. I recommend this for the whole family."
2,Nice,"I liked this Ice age, but the orginal was the best. It was kind of pointless to make this Ice age, but it turned out ok enough"
4,Loved,"I love the ICE AGE Series this was a great addition and in blue ray made it even better, really enjoyed"
5,Hilarious!,My daughter loved this. I have to say even I really liked it. She is 6 and thought it was funny as anything.
4,Always a pleasure like the others,"It was a fun movie just like the others, though starting to get too many main characters. Glad to see more use of the squirrel."
4,Not Quite as Funny,The third in the series was not quite as funny as the first two but still worth seeing. I enjoyed it just almost as well though!
5,GREAT MOVIE AS USUAL,"WE ALWAYS LAUGH FROM THE BEGINNING TILL THE END OF ALL THE ICE AGE MOVIES. IT'S A PLEASURE TO WATCH A MOVIE WITH YOUR FAMILY WITHOUT THE WORRY OF BAD LANGUAGE, SEX SCENES AND VIOLENCE! MAKE MORE MOVIES LIKE THESE PLEASE AND THANK YOU FOR ANOTHER ICE AGE WELL DONE!!"
4,good movie,this is a good movie that is great for the family. it's funny and very entertaining. i hope you like it too.
3,Not as good as the others,"Christmas present from family as I had enjoyed the first 3 so much, but was more than a little disappointed in this effort. CGI is excellent, but the antagonist ape and crew are awful, can you say Jar Jar Binks??? Should have sent that whole idea to the trash can and found a different storyline."
4,Glad I rented it,"I own the first three segments, and reviews were indicating that maybe the story line was getting old. I REALLY wanted to love this one....but....won't be buying this to watch over and over like the earlier releases."
5,It was funny!,My brothers and I enjoyed the movie. Sid said the funniest things. The squirrel is funny too. It was the best movie we've seen so far.
4,another Ice Age,I liked Continental Drift. It was funny and Manny has problems with his daughter growing up. Poor Scrat always in search of his acorn and never gets the nut. Although he does get bounced around a lot when trying to get his acorn.They did leave it open when another Sabre Toothed Tiger came along.
4,Wasn't what I thought,I liked it but it wasn't like the previouse Ice Age the previous ones I really like and I watch them over and over again.
3,"Good, the others were better","Overall, the others were more fun for me. This one had some good parts like with Scrat but other aspects of the story felt to drag."
5,Great!,"When there are sequels one is always suspicious that the story will be ""same plot, different setting"". This is not the case. This is a great, fun, original tale. We, adults and children alike loved it."
5,Another Great Sequel,"Having kids means sometimes having to watch things suitable for them. The Ice Age movies have actually (suprisingly) been movies that I actually enjoy as an adult viewer. I have never been disappointed with any of the Ice Age movies. This edition still has the wonderful interplay of the characters, Manny, Syd, and Diego, in their unusual ""family"". A couple of new characters are added for this episode: Syd's granny, a pirate baboon, and a love interest for Diego. The humor is still wonderful and the message is still clear: Families come in all shapes and sizes (and individual members have their own strengths and weaknesses) and there is nothing more important than the family unit."
3,tempting,I can't wait to watch it. Does just what a trailer should do... gives just enough info to pic your interest but not enough to give away the story.
4,Scrat,Can't go wrong with these toons for the kids. My son enjoys the series and all he talks about is the Scrat squirrel.
4,Intertaining,With all that is going on in our lives its good to watch some nonsense sometimes It was intertaining to watch
5,What you expect...,"Silly fun, expertly done. While this isn't new ground, and there are no great surprises this is still worth a watch if you are a fan."
5,So funny,We have loved all of the Ice Age movies. They did a great job extending the story line with Many and Ellie having Peaches. Great movie again!
5,Another cute Ice Age,I just adored the first Ice Age and have seen each one since. This latest installment was no disappoinment. Manny & the gang keep it going and come out on top again.
4,Ice age,It has some funny parts but its not as funny as the other ice age movies. I think it's run it's corse.
3,The kids like it...,"Haven't had time or attention to watch it in it's entirety, though the kids have watched it several times and it seems to keep them entertained."
3,Lacked usual humor,"This one just wasn't as funny as the rest. I love this movie series and enjoy watching them with my children, this one just lacked the usual humor that I enjoy in these movies."
4,Movie is okay,"Glad I just rented it than seeing it in a movie theater. Okay to see once, though if your having a down day, I'd probably see it again."
2,Shark consider yourself jumped,"Man, I think I am over this series. Not to say there were not ok moments, i can see how the maybe 8 and under crowd would still like them, but for the most part, please stop making these. I don't even find the squirrel cute anymore, and that is a shame."
3,Not Up To Snuff,"I expected the story to be on a par with the three previous Ice Age movies I've seen, but it disappointed me. It started off okay with the start of continental breakup, but after that I just could not accept all that additional nuttiness about pirates in the ice age as being on a par with the previous story lines."
4,Pretty good sequel.,"If you are a fan of the Ice Age movie series, then you probably know what to expect here. I held off on purchasing this movie, based on negative reviews. After renting the movie and watching it myself, I find this to be a perfectly good sequel. - Is it as good as the 1st or even 2nd film? No. I don't think so; however, it is still very entertaining and fun to watch. If you have kids, I am certain they will enjoy it. There are a few cheesy moments and some not so surprising plot turns, the whole pirate theme thing and a few small annoyances with the dialogue, yet I still felt 4 stars, to say ""I like it"" is a more fair rating than 3 stars, for just ""okay"" for this 4th installment to the franchise. Worth a look and even purchase, in my opinion."
4,Ice Age: Contintal Drift,I have all the Ice Age movies and enjoy them all. This one is not my favorite but I do like it.
5,A Movie That Will Keep You Laughing!,"I have really enjoyed the Ice Age movies in the past and all have been funny, but this one was simply hilarious There were so many funny lines and situations within the movie. I found myself rolling on the floor many times in the movie. While my kids did not always get the humor that I picked up on, it was still a great story for the whole family! If you are looking for a movie that will keep you laughing from beginning to end with a great cast of characters (both new and old) this is definitely the movie that you should be turning to! All-in-all I was so impressed, and you will be too!"
3,Average,"The fourth installment of the Ice Age series is a throw back to the first film by separating Manny, Sid, and Diego from Manny's wife & daughter. A new character, Granny (Sid's grandma), pops in and out of their adventure purely for humor purposes. While on an iceberg trying to get back to Manny's family, they bump into a group of insane pirates who want to take Manny captive.Overall, it's a cute film kids will love (with a heartwarming lesson for all), but as a fan of the original, the jokes fall flat at times and the production design isn't as creative. Worth a rental but I wouldn't buy it."
4,Not Enough Scrat!,"The movie description and DVD cover indicate that our beloved Scrat will have a bigger role in this movie. Unfortunately that is not the case. In my opinion, the few scenes involving Scrat are the funniest and most memorable scenes in this movie!I'm sure small children will enjoy the whole movie, but as an adult - I Need More Scrat!!"
3,"Ok, not nearly as funny as the past movies!","This movie was funny, but not nearly as much as the recent ones. Only buy if you get a good deal."
4,Ice age review,My grandson loved it!! He's 2yr old and sits and watches it over and over. Glad Santa brought it to him!
4,Cute,Just another cute movie fun for all ages. My favorite part of the whole movie is that silly squirrel and his nut :)
5,Super !!,"Now I can watch it when I want, not when the cable company want to air it. And, NO, I will not comply with your minimum amount of words....."
1,Disappointing.,"Obnoxious , annoying , can't believe this great cast agreed to blurt out some of the trash spoken out to young ears."
4,fun for the family,Funny movie that kept the whole family interested including teenagers. We appreciated the wide variety of humor that was aimed at multiple ages. The movie also moved quickly so no one got bored...
3,Doesn't touch the original!,"I loved the original movie, but I think after....what? Three or four iterations, they're desperate to come up with plot lines. I think the squirrel and nut thing should be retired...as a sideline joke, it's fine, but for the basic premise of the movie? Meh. Whatever. It must be said, however, that the kids LOVED it!"
2,Too much fight,"I will not repeat what others said. The only one thing I really did NOT like was that there was way too much violence. Sure, I get the idea of pirates, but it was too much. Knifes? Fire weapon? And this is a movie for kids? I see some trend of violent movies - compare Cars and Cars2. Similar thing was done here.Except that - it was funny; however, I have a feeling the first two parts of Ice Age were the best.Go see it, but I would not spend 20 USD on DVD..."
3,not so great,"the whole pirate deal was dumb. the only reason i and the rest of the world watched it is because of Nicki minaj, drake, and JLo were on it."
1,Not A family Moive,"This is one of the moives that I can put in the I will never see it again group. That is the way how the acting was done. Both side are mean each other. The girl is mean to her father who is trying to her out and she is mean to her best friend and say,"" That he is never her friend"" when she meets and talk to the boy. At the end it is her best friend the one that she say ""That he is never her friend"" that save her. The ones that get a ship, are mean to each other. All I can say is ""That is other movie that I should have never use my money on and to see it. It was not funnying it was very mean and very hurtful that they acted. I wanted to get up and get my money back but I do not. If I could I give this moive NO STAR AT ALL. I WILL NEVER SEE THIS AGAIN!!!"
1,I love Sick-Flix dot com,This movie was fantastic but i give it one star because it didnt come out a lot sooner. Go to a place where 3D is free... Sick-Flix. google it.anyway this was a much better movie than the third one. i loved it. and the disc is going to include a few 3D bonus features including the latest and greatest looney tunes in 3D. so i hear....or saw...whichever...
2,Tired,"Sometimes I feel like beating a dead horse --- but then other times I just wish the horse was gone and this is one of those times. My kids seemed to enjoy it, sortof."
2,Easily the worst of the series,Pro: Not a complete waste of money since we did watch the entire thing.Con: Eminently forgettable and will probably never watch again. As such I wish I had just rented it.
3,Not as good as the others...,"I personally think ALL the previous Ice Age movies were better than this one, ESP in the comedy area. It was good, just not gut-busting like the others!"
3,Another episode.,What can be said. It's ok. If there's nothing else to watch its ok. Hate this word count to just post something.
4,Little kids love this!,"Not as clever as the first one, but my 7-year-old daughter loved it just the same. Definitely worth renting. Maybe not worth owning."
5,Ice Age: Continental Drift- awesome movie,"I have enjoyed and loved all the Ice Age movie Series- they're been smart and equally fun, and well realized too"
5,love it,"this is a totally fun cute movie, the kids got it for Christmas and have watched it over and over. My kids are 3 yrs up to 8 yrs old and all of them like it."
5,Ice Age: Continental Drift,"Watched it 3 times with my grand kids, I think Skrat is our new hero! I would reccomend Ice Age Continental Drift to anyone, no matter your age."
3,Fun kids movie,This movie is okay. Seems like each Ice Age after the first is never as good. This movie has some funny parts and is not bad just kind of weird with all the different actors voices but all and all it's an enjoyable movie.
4,As usual...pretty good!,"As usual Ice Age is a family friendly movie that has been orchestrated, in such a way, to be enjoyed by both adults and children. As always, Sid, the Sloth, is our favorite and keeps you laughing.Regarding the service. I was able to play the move from amazon without a hitch. No glitches. Played very well. As good as...if not better than netflix. We watched another movie as well...same thing. So, if you are worried about whether or not you have trouble playing it....no need to worry~! Enjoy your movie!"
5,the grandchildren were very pleased!,It was what the grandchildren wanted and they got it . All are happy!!!We have to keep them entertained .
5,Another cute Ice Age movie,"ALways love the characters, especialy scrat.....many smiles as they encounter life on the planet in the past. Good family flick"
2,bad 3D recording,"I had to order and return two copies of the 3D DVD beacse it would not run well on my Tv and player. It seems that they may have had a bad patch. Other 3D DVDs work great, so i know its not the player. The regular blu ray 2D works fine"
4,ice age continental drift,"I like ice age continental drift extended preview because it really showed you what the actual movie was about.I also liked it because it wasn't, like one of those 2 minute previews it was a while longer."
2,terrible,They made it trashy. The young characters talked like they were from the getto. Too bad because I really liked the others.
4,cute,"good movie, great HD picture, the scenes where it would have been 3D are a little ""puke-riffic"" but other than that this is another great addition to the Ice Age line of movies"
5,Still making a great movie!,"I just love to watch the antics of Scratch, there could be a whole movie on him alone!We really enjoyed this movie, even has some adult humor."
2,More juvenile than expected,"Why is it that often sequels of witty, original animated films get more juvenile as they age into number III and IV? Is it because the producers think the adults are getting bored and that only the kids have the patience to sit through another one?"
4,No comment,It is stupid that in order to rate a movie you have to make comments equivalent to a certain number of words.
2,Disappointed,No even close to the first 2. There is no real story. Disjointed. Even scrat was not funny. The director lost track of the comedy from the first one
5,Loved It!,This was my first purchase for my son's Kindle Fire HD Xmas gift and it was well worth the wait!
4,nosebleed section,"I saw these guys play in a little deli restaurant and they played like it was an arena! Very cool c.d.,very cool guys. Lucky to have seen them play a bunch of times and they always killed it. Fortified is a solid metal song and the album just keeps you in the mood. Good road music."
1,Did anyone even edit this book?,"The quick lowdown; Don't buy this product. I've been forced to buy the Jepp version after I wasted money on this one.I'm a CFI applicant with a commercial license and Instrument Rating. I've used the ASA and Jeppesen versions of the FAR/AIM and I tell you, I'm so disappointed with the McGraw Hill ""Aviation Week"" AIM/FAR. I've found many editing errors including references to figures that are not on the pages referenced, and table of contents tabs which are not aligned properly. Also, there are newly inserted text sections wholly in the wrong subpart.There are no indents to allow subparts of one section to be distinguised from the subpart of another subsection. The attemt to save space (hence, weight) is not worth the incredible increase in difficulty of trying to reference subparts which are referenced with no indentations."
1,Confusing subject matter made worse,"I would concur with everything said in the review by Ryan Kelly. Stick with Jepp. It's frustrating enough trying to find information in these thick regs, but to find paths that lead to nowhere is the height of aggravation.I'm sorry, but the positive review here is suspiciously glowing, and anonymous."
4,What a great way to learn the months!,"Happy Birthday Word Bird offers an easy way for young readers to learn the months of the year. By associating events and particular items with months, young readers can better understand the sequence of holidays and the months in which they fall. In the case of my son, he really enjoys the finale', ""Surprise! Happy Birthday, Word Bird!"" The pictures make learning new vocabulary easy, too."
5,This author is one of my kids favorites.,We've read all of this author's books outloud together as a family. It's a great way to spend an evening.
5,"Riveting, one of her best!","This book is truly a work of art. It gives you a feeling of accomplishment while reading of Sandry's, Tris', Daja's, and Briar's trials and how they stay loyal to each other. I cannot say enough about it. A truly wonderful book. BRAVO!"
3,An OK book......,"Brair's Book had a slow start but once it got going it was pretty good. A little more excitment would've been great though...... Even so, Tamora Pierce's fans should definately read this"
5,I Loved this book!,I thought this was the best book of the serise. I realy liked the interaction between Rosethorn and Crane(I think that's his name) At first you think that they hate eachother but through their actions you can see that they really care about eachother. Personaly I think they're in love and they just don't want to admit it. READ THIS BOOK!
4,good read,"I love any book by Tamora Pierce. This series is good and if it was by any other author I would call it great. However, since I have such high expectations for Tamora Pierce I cannot call it truly wonderful."
5,I love Tamora Pierce,Her writing style is amazing! My friend Tess and I can't stop reading! (Not that we'd want to) I especially like the Lioness Quartet because my name is Alana and the Lioness is a great role model! Keep up the great work.
2,The worst of the series....,"The book was very boring and had was very lacking. There was no action in it. It was very run on, lagging, and it dragged on and on. For a ex-thief, he sure didn't seem to be very exciting. Please understand that i am not saying that i do not like the others. the others are perfectly fine."
1,Hmm...,"I find it hilarious that this book was given five stars, so many people over rate things. Only diehard grade school Pierce fans will fall for this cheap piece of a kiddie read.If at all possible, AVOID this book. Get CROWN DUEL or SCENT OF MAGIC instead."
1,WHY??,"Okay, I read the whole series because I love Tamora Pierce, and i can understand watned to try something new, but this was TERRIBLE! The whole series was just TERRIBLE! The same plot through all four books, the worst plot in all cases, and the ending was predictable. I felt that the Tortall series, all of them, were much MUCH more woth the read. Flames to this review are welcome, but I'm only trying to help."
1,ICk!,"This book was horribly dull, such easy vocabulary yet such touchy touchy relationships. Pass this."
1,What? Tammy...uh oh..,"I was largely disapointed by the this Book, i fell asleep reading it, and the plot is not facinating and I thought that Tammy would do better than that...but it's really boring and well, not interesting, so don't waste your time on this!"
3,Briar's Book,"This book was...okay is guess. Although it's well writen and not confusing or anything, it doesn't have the adventure or excitment found in many of the other Tamora Pierce books. I really like books in The Circle Opens much better, I recommend that instead."
4,Why is everyone getting sick?,This book was a great book in this series. Briar is the main character and he a Rosethorn have to find out why all the people in the town are getting a highly contagious disease. Briar's friend is one of the people that get it ( not one of the girls) yet she is on the street and could be one of the problems. Latter they find out the rich are getting sick too. All of these people are dying very fast and they can not seem to find the source of the problem. Soon Rosethorn is sick too! So Briar has to manage taking care of many people and it is mainly up to him to find out what the disease is and where it came from. Read this book to find the surprising and amazing end!
5,Great!,"Read this a while ago, best book I've read in a long time. Can't really remember everything that happened so I'll just say that I reeeeeally enjoyed it, fav. in the series. Easy vocab. but still a great book and if you enjoyed the other books, go and get this one!!!!!"
4,Excellent book for young adults,"This book wonderfully ended this Tamora Pierce series. I have read all of this authors books, and each of them have at least one strength - this one has more than just one. This series was geared toward a younger audience than Tamora Pierce's other books (no one has romantic relationships, and there is no violence or death of characters, for the most part), but while this series was slower moving than her other novels, it still keeps your attention. Great book!"
4,Just About Up To Voodoo Standards,"This video card is excellent. It has the quality of a Voodoo3, but for a lesser price. My cousin has a Voodoo3 2000 and his graphics are just as good as mine. ... . Big difference in price... but very little difference in quality and 3D graphics. Overall, I'd get this card and not the Voodoo3."
4,Works well,"I love my Apple monitor, and this made it even better. I just bought a Dell monitor to go next to it and am very unhappy with the quality of it. It wouldn't have been a bargain at half the price. My Apple monitor on this and an Ergotron monitor arm is wonderful."
1,Shame on Apple for not making a standard accessory!,Every cheapest monitor on the market has it as an standard accessory and only Apple robs you for $30 for a plain piece of metal. What a shame and what a greed!
1,Inclomplete for the 27 iMac,It was advertised for the 27 iMac but in order for it to work with it you need to get additional parts and I'm not referring to a telescopic arm only. Ask before you buy.
2,Better guides out there,"The best part of this book was the Appendix of Internet Resources, and this alone does not warrant the cost of the book. I found much better information on performing health searches, as well as various other industries, in Find it Online: the Complete Guide to Online Research. Detwiler's book had some good information in it, but it was sporadic, and I did not find the interview format useful--on the contrary, many of the questions were irrelevant, or were good questions, but not really answered by the interviewee. This book is not really a useful tool for researchers, as there is too much useless information to wade through in order to glean anything of value; and there are certainly no ""secrets"", as far as I could see, that could not be found in other, more comprehensive, research guides."
2,messing up basic terms,"...very dissapointed to start reading the book of an ""expert"" by reading at the preface the phrase ""with diverse ethnic groups occupying the region"": what is an ""ethnic"" group in a pre-ethnic world?kpph.d. student in pol. sciences & history"
4,Chocolate Lizards,"Its the only book I've seen dealing with the contemporary oil patch which, since the early 80's, appears to be heading for extinction. While the tech talk might seem burdensome, the author is well informed and gives you a primer on the domestic oil industry that would put you way ahead of most Department of Energy employees not to mention most politicans.All the above plus a great tale to boot."
